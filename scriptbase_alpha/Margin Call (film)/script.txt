    INT. LARGE INVESTMENT BANK TRADING FLOOR - DAY
1                                                                    1

    The frame is filled with the face of PETER SULLIVAN, a 27-
    year-old risk assessment analyst. He has a Doctorate from MIT
    and is staring intently into a large bank of computer
    screens.

    An elevator door opens and FOUR HUMAN RESOURCES PEOPLE come
    out of the elevator carrying large file boxes. They walk down
    a long glass enclosed hallway that runs the full length of
    the trading floor. The scope of the floor now comes into
    frame. There are more computers than can be imagined and
    several large boards on the far walls that are scrolling
    thousands of numbers. PETER gives a knowing glance to the guy
    sitting next to him, SETH BREGMAN, a young analyst in his
    early twenties.

                        SETH
              Is that them?

                           PETER
              (nods yes)

                        SETH
              Jesus Christ.

    The HUMAN RESOURCES people turn and separate into a large
    glass walled conference room that runs along the floor as
    almost every person on the floor watches.

                        SETH (cont'd)
              Are they going to do it right there?

                           PETER
              Yeah.

                           SETH
              Fuck me.

    WILL EMERSON, sitting next to them, leans back in his chair.

                        WILL EMERSON
                  (whispered)
              Have you guys ever seen this before?

                           SETH
              No.

                        WILL EMERSON
              Best to just ignore it. Keep your head
              down and get back to work... and don't
              watch.



                                                       (CONTINUED)
                                                               2.

    The HR people begin walking out onto the floor looking at a
    piece of paper in their hand then walking up behind a person
    and asking their name. It is brutal. The camera follows one
    HR woman, HEATHER, with her piece of paper down the hall and
    into a row of employees, she walks right past the THREE GUYS
    then stops a bit down from them.

                           HEATHER
                 Timothy Singh?

                              TIMOTHY
                 Yes.

                           HEATHER
                 I'm afraid we have to speak with you.

    TIM gets up and walks back towards the conference room with
    the woman. PETER puts on his headphones and very loud RAP
    MUSIC drowns out all other noise and PETER tries to get lost
    back into the numbers on his computer screen.

    The sequence follows the HR people walking around and firing
    people intercut with PETER just staring at his computer
    screen. It runs for almost the length of the song until
    finally the same woman comes walking back down the hall and
    stops behind PETER and taps him on the shoulder. He takes off
    his headphones and the MUSIC STOPS. He is shell-shocked.

                              HEATHER (cont'd)
                 Eric Dale?

                              PETER
                 Excuse me?

                              HEATHER
                 Eric Dale?

                              PETER
                 No.

                              HEATHER
                 Sorry?

                           PETER
                 I'm not Eric Dale.

                           HEATHER
                 Oh. I'm so sorry.

                           PETER
                 He's my boss, he's down that hall.
                                                                  3.

     ERIC DALE is sitting at his desk, he is 52 years old and
     looks exhausted. He looks out through the glass of his office
     as she walks over to the door.

                           HEATHER
               Mr. Dale?

                           ERIC
               Yes.

                           HEATHER
               This way.

     ERIC walks out the door first.

     They walk along the full length of the trading floor to reach
     one of the conference rooms. Everyone left on the floor is
     watching.

     There is a more senior looking Human Resources lawyer, LAUREN
     BRATBERG, already sitting at the table. They all sit and look
     at each other for a beat.

                         LAUREN BRATBERG
               Well... Mr. Dale I'm obviously sorry that
               we are here today but these are extra
               ordinary times as you very well must
               know.

                         ERIC
               I run risk management... it just doesn't
               seem like a natural place to start
               cutting.

                         HEATHER
               I hope you understand that this is in no
               way personal. A majority of this floor is
               being let go today.

                           ERIC
               OK

                         HEATHER
               Mr. Dale. Ms. Bratberg is now going to
               run through the details of what the firm
               is offering.

                           ERIC
                 OK

    LAUREN BRATBERG slides across the table a very thick
    severance contract agreement.

                           LAUREN BRATBERG
                 Mr. Dale the firm is offering you six
                 months severance at half your salary. You
                 will keep all unvested options that you
                 currently hold. Health will be extended
                 through that period. You have till

    She looks at her watch.

                           LAUREN BRATBERG (cont'd)
                 4:47 to either take the offer or it will
                 be revoked. Do you understand?

                           ERIC
                 Yes.

                           LAUREN BRATBERG
                 Now, unfortunately Mr. Dale due to the
                 highly sensitive nature of your work here
                 the firm has to take certain precautions
                 for security purposes that may seem
                 punitive in nature. I hope considering
                 your...

    SHE looks down at the piece of paper in front of her to fact
    check.

                            LAUREN BRATBERG (cont'd)
                 ...over 19 years of service to the firm,
                 you will understand that these measures
                 are in no way a reflection of the firms'
                 feelings towards your performance or your
                 character.

                           ERIC
                 I'm sorry??

                           HEATHER
                 She's apologizing for what's about to
                 happen.

                           LAUREN BRATBERG
                 Your company email, access to the server,
                 access to the building, and your mobile
                 data and phone service will all be
                 severed as of this meeting. This

    She points behind him and a smallish benign looking SECURITY
    GUARD is standing in the doorway.

                        LAUREN BRATBERG (cont'd)
              will take you to your office so that you
              can clear out your personal belongings.

                        ERIC
              What about my current ongoing work? I'm
              right in the...

                        LAUREN BRATBERG
              The firm has worked out its transition
              plan and is prepared to move forward, but
              we appreciate your concern.

                        HEATHER
              We understand that this is very difficult
              and here is my card. Please contact me
              over the next few weeks if there is
              anything that I can do to help you
              through this transition in your life.

    They all stare at each other in silence for several long
    awkward beats.

                         SECURITY GUARD
              Sir?

    ERIC finally stands up and walks out with the guard and back
    over to his office.

    ERIC walks into the office and sits at his desk and begins to
    clear his things out into a file box. The guard stands at the
    door. Eventually ERIC'S sympathetic yet still energetic
    immediate superior, WILL EMERSON comes to the door.

                         WILL EMERSON

                 Congratulations.

                 It's a total bloodbath.

                              ERIC
                 I heard.

                           WILL EMERSON
                 If there was anything I coulda done, you
                 know I woulda done it.

                              ERIC
                 I know.

    WILL EMERSON just looks back at him in silence.

                           ERIC (cont'd)
                 That cunt. I knew it. I never should have
                 gone to her last year.

                           WILL EMERSON
                 Look it wasn't anyone. It's just bad
                 luck. Right....?

                              ERIC
                 Yeah.

                              WILL EMERSON
                 Good luck.

    They look at each other with respect but do not shake hands
    as WILL EMERSON starts to leave the office.

              You know I was just in the middle of a
              bunch of shit here that someone should
              really take a look at.

                        WILL EMERSON
              Eric, they are telling us that everyone
              has got to get out of here and leave
              everything behind. While we appreciate
              your concern, this is not your problem
              anymore. Alright? Good luck.

    ERIC looks straight ahead as WILL leaves the office. He packs
    up the last of his things, which does not take long, then
    stands and gets ready to walk out. He looks around and heads
    out into the cubicle area.

                           ERIC
                 That's not necessary.

                           PETER
                 Well it is... You were the person around
                 here that I...

    ERIC looks at him and understands. PETER turns around and
    begins to walk back toward his desk.

                           ERIC
                 I know.

    PETER turns back and ERIC reaches into one of his boxes and
    takes out a small key chain portable hard drive and hands it
    to PETER.

                           ERIC (cont'd)
                 I was close to something here... But they
                 wouldn't let me finish it. Take a look.

    The elevator doors open and ERIC gets into the elevator. Just
    as the doors are closing he says...

                           ERIC (cont'd)
                 Be careful.

    The doors close.

    SAM ROGERS, a 57 year old executive, is sitting behind his
    desk looking out the window. WILL EMERSON gently knocks on
    the door, enters then sits on the couch.

                           WILL EMERSON
                 Well, that was fucking hideous.

                 It's gonna get worse before it gets
                 better.

                              WILL EMERSON
                 Really?

                              SAM ROGERS
                 Much.

                           WILL EMERSON
                 Got any nicorettes? I'm out of
                 nicorettes, which means I'm gonna kill
                 someone in about 10 minutes... You
                 alright?

                           SAM ROGERS
                 My dog is dying.

                              WILL EMERSON
                 I'm sorry?

                           SAM ROGERS
                 Just spoke to the vet, it's some fucking
                 tumor on her liver. I'm paying almost a
                 thousand bucks a day to keep her alive.

                              WILL EMERSON
                 Really?

                           SAM ROGERS
                 Yeah... and I don't have a clue what to
                 do about it.

    They both sit in silence and look out the window.

                           WILL EMERSON
                 Well they're all gone.

                           SAM ROGERS
                 How many do we have left?

                           WILL EMERSON
                 Thirty-three.

                           SAM ROGERS
                 Make sure everyone is out there, I need
                 to say something.

                           WILL EMERSON
                 They are ready for you.

    WILL leaves SAM in his office. SAM looks as if he may not
    move, then snaps out of it.
                                                                 10.

    SAM ROGERS walks out of his office and stands in front of the
    trading floor that just an hour before had seated 130 people.
    Now just thirty-three are scattered throughout the vast
    mostly empty space. They all look up in silence at him. Long
    pause, then SAM'S face begins to glow a bit. His posture
    straightens, he fills up. He speaks slowly at first then
    builds.

                        SAM ROGERS
              You are all still here for a reason...
              Most of this floor was just sent home...
              forever. We have spent the last hour
              saying good-bye... they were good people
              and they were good at their jobs... but
              you all were better. Now they are gone.
              They are not to be thought of again. This
              is your opportunity. On every floor of
              this building and in every office from
              Hong Kong to London the same thing is
              happening. Before this is all done 3 of
              every ten guys who were standing between
              you and your boss's job are now gone.
              That is your opportunity. I've been at
              this place for thirty-four years and let
              me tell you that this will not be the
              last time you go through this. But you
              all are survivors... And that is how this
              firm over 107 years has always continued
              to grow stronger. So hold your heads
              high... and get back to work.

    He looks out at them then turns and heads back into his
    office and closes the door.

    SAM falls into the couch and looks forward in a deflated
    daze. His eyes no longer believe what he says.

    ERIC DALE walks out the front door carrying the file boxes.
    There are other people streaming out the door doing the same
    thing. ERIC stops, turns, and looks up at the building then
    tries to make a phone call but his phone does not work as it
    has been shut off by the firm. He looks up to the sky and
    can't believe his fate. As he looks down he sees a woman,
    SARAH ROBERTSON, serious, classically beautiful and dressed
    in a well tailored power suit with her head down walking into
    the building. He can't help himself.

                               ERIC
                  Robertson!

     SARAH does not respond.

                            ERIC (cont'd)
                  Sarah Robertson!

     This time she looks up. When she sees him she debates if she
     should stop. She does. He slowly moves a little closer to
     her, still carrying the slightly tattered box with his
     personal belongings in it.

                            ERIC (cont'd)
                  You shut off my phone???

                            SARAH ROBERTSON
                  Eric... I didn't do anything.

     They stare at each other.

                               ERIC
                  Fuck you.

     They look at each other for a longer beat, both a little
     shocked that ERIC was so openly confrontational. She turns
     and heads back inside quickly. ERIC drops the phone to the
     ground and walks away.

     Most of the remaining traders are packing up and getting
     ready to go home or out for the night. PETER is sitting at
     his desk holding the portable hard drive. SETH is getting
     ready to leave behind him. PETER stares down at the drive in
     his hand trying to decide whether to proceed.

                               SETH
                  You ok?

                            PETER
                  Yeah. Just a little freaked out.

                            SETH
                  You want to get a drink?

                            PETER
                  Nah, I need to clean up a few things
                  around here.

                  Everyone is going out... come on.

                  Well, give me a call if you change your
                  mind.

                               PETER
                  I will.

                            PETER
                  I'll call you when I'm done.

                            SETH
                  Be glad, you're still alive.

                               PETER
                  I am.

     SETH walks out and PETER puts on his headphones, the MUSIC
     kicks in again. He picks up the portable hard drive, looks
     around and sees no one, then inserts it into his computer. He
     has four large screens in front of him and as he begins
     opening window upon window of mathematical models his face
     begins to soften and he gets into his comfort zone. The frame
     is filled with the extremely complex programs and numbers
     flying by.

     In a locked off shot SETH and WILL are sitting on a couch
     staring forward. Figures cross frame and occasionally another
     banker in the group stops to refill his drink with one of the
     three bottles in ice buckets on the table in front of them.
     They are celebrating, but it seems a little forced.
                                                               13.

     PETER is still working on the numbers, although his face
     starts to carry a more serious look. He is now wearing
     glasses and the numbers on the screen are reflected in them.
     The numbers finally stop moving on the screen and then he
     takes his glasses off and rubs his eyes.

     PETER is still in front of his computer, he puts his glasses
     back on, looks at the screen then quickly picks up the phone
     and dials.

     picks up the phone again and dials.

     SETH and WILL walk through the door and into the empty main
     trading floor. The lights are down and there is a cleaning
     person vacuuming in the far background. They walk over to
     PETER'S desk.

                         WILL EMERSON
               Hey, look who it is, burning the candle
               at both ends. There aren't anymore cuts
               planned though, so you can stop kissing
               my ass, honestly I don't even understand
               what you guys do.

                         PETER
               Will, I am so sorry to call you back but
               I really think..

                         WILL EMERSON
               Don't worry about it.

                         SETH
               Hey.

     WILL is a bit drunk but SETH looks at PETER'S face and
     realizes something is up.

                         SETH (cont'd)
               What's going on?

                         PETER
               Look at this.

     SETH comes around and sits at PETER'S desk.

                         PETER (cont'd)
               Eric gave me this file before he left.

                         SETH
               Eric?

                         PETER
               Dale. And he told me he couldn't quite
               figure it out, then the last thing he
               says as the doors on the elevator close
               is `be careful'.

                         WILL EMERSON
               Be careful?

                         PETER
               So I'm obviously a little curious. So I
               get into it a bit and I realize that all
               he was missing was...well it's not good.

     SETH looks at the screen and starts to scroll through the
     pages.

                            SETH
                  What is he doing here?

                            PETER
                  Go to model four, and it makes more
                  sense.

                              SETH
                  Oh.

     WILL is now paying closer attention, standing over their
     shoulder.

                            WILL EMERSON
                  What is this?

                            PETER
                  This is basically everything that we have
                  on our books at any given time. But what
                  Eric was trying to do here is work it for
                  levels of volatility that fall outside
                  the limits of our standard VAR model.

                            WILL EMERSON
                  What are those levels.

                            PETER
                  Well it's a fairly complicated...

                              WILL EMERSON
                  Simplify.

                            PETER
                  The volatility boundaries are basically
                  set using historic patterns then
                  stretching them out another 10-15%...
                  roughly.

                            WILL EMERSON
                  So what's happening?

                            SETH
                  We are starting to test those historic
                  patterns.

                              WILL EMERSON
                  When?

     PETER starts scrolling back through the last couple weeks on

                         SETH

     WILL starts off towards his office and is suddenly quite
     sober. PETER and SETH follow him.

                         PETER
               They turned off everyone's phone who they
               axed today.

               Yes... Do we even know if he's right?

     WILL looks at PETER and SETH standing in front of his desk.

     SETH and PETER sit in the back of the plush car as it
     struggles through traffic up town. SETH reaches into his bag
     and pulls out a large beer in a black paper bag. Their
     conversation is quiet, as if they are afraid someone might be
     listening.

                         SETH
               You want one?

                         PETER
               No.

     PETER gives him a bit of a look.

               What, we got them on our way to meet you
               at the office... we didn't know what the
               fuck you wanted to talk about...
                   (almost to himself)
               ... thought you might've gotten some
               chick pregnant or something.

                         PETER
               I haven't gotten laid in so long that's
               not possible at this point.

                         SETH
               I guess that's true.

     PETER looks out the window at all the people on the street
     enjoying the Thursday night.

                         PETER
               Look at these people.

               ending, and they've got no idea what's
               coming.

     SETH'S demeanor sitting and drinking a beer doesn't seem to

                  on a computer screen, so a bunch of
                  glorified crack addicts could take that
                  information and pretend to understand it,
                  and then make a bet against some other
                  jock half way around the world who if he
                  wasn't doing this would probably be in
                  some OTB somewhere putting it all on
                  number seven. And at the end of the day
                  one guy loses and the other guy wins.

     PETER continues to look out the window in silence for a long
     beat. Then with a little sly humor and a smile to SETH:

                            PETER
                  You do know it's a little more
                  complicated than that?

     SETH'S phone starts playing a ring tone. He looks down at the
     text.

                            SETH
                  It's Will... He wants to know if we've
                  found him? What do I tell him.

                            PETER
                  Tell him that we haven't found him.

     SAM ROGERS comes through the door from the elevator looking
     quite disheveled and walks across the long and empty trading
     floor. He looks around, then heads over to WILL EMERSON'S
     office where the light is on.

     SAM lightly knocks on the glass.

                  Hey.

                            WILL EMERSON
                  Hey.

     SAM looks at WILL for some hint of what is going on, then
     eventually puts his coat down and sits into a chair. They
     wait for who goes first.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  So?

                            WILL EMERSON
                  Eric Dale...

                            SAM ROGERS
                  Oh Jesus...

                            WILL EMERSON
                  Before he was escorted out of the
                  building by security...

                            SAM ROGERS
                  I had nothing to do with that.

                            WILL EMERSON
                  I know.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  I'm sorry, go on.

                            WILL EMERSON
                  So as he was leaving the building he
                  hands a disk to Peter Sullivan...

                            SAM ROGERS
                  Who's Peter Sullivan again?

                            WILL EMERSON
                  One of Eric's guys.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  Right.

                            WILL EMERSON
                  ...and tells him that he was almost on to
                  something but hasn't been able to figure
                  it out. So he gives him the disk and says
                  give it a try... but the last thing he
                  says as the doors to the elevator close
                  is `be careful'...

                            SAM ROGERS
                  Be careful?

               Yeah.

                         SAM ROGERS
               Be careful?

                            WILL EMERSON
               Yes.

                            SAM ROGERS
               Why?

                         WILL EMERSON
               Well... take a look.

                         SAM ROGERS
               Speak, you know I can't read those
               fucking things they put together.

                          WILL EMERSON
               Basically the kid dives right into the
               thing after your little pep talk, nice
               job by the way, and he seems to have
               nailed it.

                            SAM ROGERS
               Nailed it?

                         WILL EMERSON
               The kid figured out what Eric was
               missing. And...

                            SAM ROGERS
               And?

     WILL gives him a long pause.

                         WILL EMERSON
               ...it isn't good.

     WILL'S look gets SAM up and he comes over to stand behind
     WILL at his desk and look at the computer.

                         WILL EMERSON (cont'd)
               As far as I can tell these here are the
               historical volatility index limits...
               which I guess our whole fucking trading
               model relies on pretty heavily... and we
               are so fucking levered up that if this
               thing starts getting outside those limits
               it gets ugly in a hurry.

                            SAM ROGERS
               How ugly?

               Real ugly.

                         SAM ROGERS
               And how close to those limits have we
               gotten?

                         WILL EMERSON
               Oh we're beyond close... We broke through
               five or six days over the last two weeks,
               but we've managed to stay on the upside
               of it... for now...

                            SAM ROGERS
               For now?

                         WILL EMERSON
               Well look what happens here when we get
               on the wrong side of it.

                         SAM ROGERS
               What am I looking at?

     WILL takes his finger and points at a red number with a whole
     lot of zeroes after it. SAM'S look says it all.

                         WILL EMERSON
               And that wouldn't even be that bad a day
               for us... historically speaking.

                         SAM ROGERS
               Is this right?

                         WILL EMERSON
               I don't know.

                         SAM ROGERS
               Where is Eric?

                         WILL EMERSON
               We shut his phone off.

                         SAM ROGERS
               Of course we did.

                         WILL EMERSON
               And he hasn't come home yet, I spoke to
               his wife.

                          SAM ROGERS
               He's probably crying in a fucking beer
               somewhere.

                         SAM ROGERS
               Do we think he knows what he's doing?

                         WILL EMERSON
               I don't know. What do I know?

     PETER and SETH are sitting at the bar each with a drink
     facing camera. There are women dancing in the background and
     one dancing in front of them, PETER and SETH look up
     occasionally.

                           PETER
               What now?

                         SETH
               We should probably tell Will he's not
               here.

                           PETER
               Yeah.

     They both just continue to look forward and sip their drinks.

                         SETH
               What do you think this girl makes in a
               night?

     They exchange a look and slam their drinks.

     They look out into the city. Finally SETH reaches into his
     bag and takes out the forty in the paper bag and starts
     drinking the beer again. He takes a big sip.

                          SETH
               So what do you think that means Rogers
               puts away?

                         PETER
               I have no idea.

     They both just look straight forward, SETH takes a big gulp
     of the beer.

                         PETER (cont'd)
               This fucking traffic. We should have
               taken a the subway.

     INT. TRADING FLOOR ELEVATOR BANK- FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER

     The doors of the elevator open and PETER and SETH look up as
     WILL EMERSON and SAM ROGERS are standing in front of them
     about to get onto the elevator. WILL and SAM are now dressed
     with fresh shirts, ties, and suits and look as if they are
     ready to start a new day even though it is almost one in the
     morning. SETH is still holding the forty in the paper bag.
     Will looks at it. They share a glancing smile. WILL and SAM
     step into the elevator keeping the guys in it.

                            WILL EMERSON
               Gentlemen?

                         SAM ROGERS
               You're coming with us.

                         SETH
               Will. Mr. Rogers.

                         WILL EMERSON
               Sam this is Seth Bregman and this is
               Peter Sullivan.

                            SETH
               Sir.

29   CONTINUED:                                                     29

     They all stand in silence as the elevator heads up until:

                            PETER
                  Will?

                            WILL EMERSON
                  Yes?

                            PETER
                  Where are we going?

                            SAM ROGERS
                  Going to get a second opinion on your
                  work Peter.

     PETER and SETH look at each other, growing more concerned.
     The doors open and they exit.

     INT. HALLWAY BY JARED'S CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     SETH looks for somewhere to throw out his beer but can't find
     a trash can. They follow SAM and WILL down a long hallway
     that is crowded with assistant cubicles. Eventually they turn
     into a small conference room that has no windows. It is
     claustrophobic.

     INT. JARED'S CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
31                                                                   31

     There are four people sitting at the table. They stand.
     Everyone says their somber hellos and shakes hands.

                            ALL PRESENT
                  Slight hellos, etc.

     They all sit down and at each place setting there is a pad of
     paper, a pencil, and an empty binder. Sitting at the head of
     the table is JARED COHEN. He is a blond boyish looking 43
     year old, although carries himself with intense confidence.
     He is the head of all fixed income securities, and oversees
     roughly 25,000 employees. Next to him is his chief risk
     management officer, SARAH ROBERTSON, the same woman from
     outside the building earlier who had the run in with ERIC.
     Next to her is her right hand man RAMESH SHAH, a sixty year
     old number cruncher and next to him is a firm lawyer. They
     are all dressed sharply for a new day. Long silence.

     SETH COUGHS.

     ALL PRESENT look down at him.

                            JARED COHEN
                  So Sam, what do you have for us?

                            SAM ROGERS
                  Well... it should be here in a minute.
                  Finding someone in the copy room at this
                  hour was a little bit of a challenge.

                            JARED COHEN
                  Well why don't we start by introducing
                  everyone then.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  OK.

                            JARED COHEN
                  This is Sarah Robertson who you know, our
                  chief risk management officer, Ramesh
                  Shah from upstairs, and David Horn one of
                  the firm's in house counsel.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  Nice to meet you all. This is Will
                  Emerson my head of trading, and this
                  is...

                            WILL EMERSON
                  Peter Sullivan, and Seth Bregman. They
                  work in our risk department.

                            JARED COHEN
                  Where is Eric Dale?

                            SAM ROGERS
                  He was let go today.

     JARED COHEN looks at SARAH ROBERTSON as it would have been
     her call to let ERIC go, she nods yes.

                            JARED COHEN
                  So who's left in your risk department?

                            WILL EMERSON
                  As of today that would be Peter and our
                  junior analyst Seth...?

     Everyone looks down the table at PETER and SETH. Their
     inexperience glares back.

                            JARED COHEN
                  Really?

     JARED looks back at SARAH, then the room goes silent again.
     Finally a COPY ROOM STAFFER knocks on the door.

                            COPY ROOM GUY
                  Will Emerson?

                         WILL EMERSON
               Here. Please just give one to everyone,
               thanks.

     The COPY ROOM GUY hands out the packets to everyone in the
     room.

                         SAM ROGERS
               So apparently Eric had been working on
               this for some time but was unable to
               finish it, as he was leaving the building
               today he gave the program to Peter here,
               and told him to see what he thought.
               Peter figured a few things out that Eric
               seemed to be missing and this is what
               came out.

                         JARED COHEN
               Where is Eric Dale now?

                         SAM ROGERS
               He's been unreachable since he left the
               office.

     JARED COHEN and the others open up the printout in front of
     them and start reviewing. SAM, WILL, PETER, and SETH just sit
     in awkward silence staring at the other side of the table as
     they all read. This goes on for a full very long minute.
     Finally:

                         SARAH ROBERTSON
               Peter this is your work?

                         PETER
               Mainly Mr. Dale's...

                         SARAH ROBERTSON
               But this draft is yours?

                         PETER
               Yes. Again, derived from Mr. Dale's
               original model. But yes.

                         SARAH ROBERTSON
               And what is your background?

                         PETER
               Background?

                          SARAH ROBERTSON

                         PETER
               I have been with the firm for two years
               working with Eric that whole time... But
               I hold a doctorate in engineering,
               specialist in propulsion, from MIT, with
               a Bachelors from Penn.

                         JARED COHEN
               What's a specialty in propulsion?

                         PETER
               Well... in laymen terms my thesis was a
               study in the way that friction ratios
               effect steering outcomes in aeronautical
               use under reduced gravity loads.

     Long silence.

                         JARED COHEN
               So you are a rocket scientist?

     The whole table looks over at Peter with some awe.

                         PETER
               Um... I was... yes.

                         JARED COHEN
               How did you end up here?

                         PETER
               Well it's all just numbers really, you're
               just changing what you're adding up...
               and if I may speak freely the money is
               considerably more attractive here.

     JARED looks down again at the numbers in front of him and his
     tone suddenly switches to serious, testy even.

                         JARED COHEN
               What time is it?

                            RAMESH
               It's 2:15.

     SAM and JARED just look at each other in silence for a bit.

                         JARED COHEN
               What do you have in exposure right now,
               tonight?

                         SAM ROGERS
               I don't know... between 900 and 1.3...
               roughly.

               If Mr. Sullivan's numbers are correct...

     RAMESH looks down at the sheet in front of him to go through
     the numbers and takes a beat too long.

                         PETER
               1.215 Trillion.

     RAMESH checks his number.

                            RAMESH
               Yes.

                         JARED COHEN
               Fuck me... fuck me... And I'm guessing by
               the fact that you two haven't said
               anything that the math checks out?

     JARED looks over at SARAH and RAMESH. SARAH then looks to
     RAMESH. She looks back.

                            SARAH ROBERTSON
               Look    we'd need a little more time to go
               over    this, but Mr. Sullivan here seems to
               know    what he's doing. And I don't have to
               tell    you that this is a problem.

                         JARED COHEN
               Thank you for that. What time is it?

                            RAMESH

                            JARED COHEN
               Fuck me!

     Jared stands up and walks around the small room. The rest of
     the room goes silent. Finally:

                         JARED COHEN (cont'd)
               Sam how long under normal operations
               would it take your people to clear that
               from our books?

                            SAM ROGERS
               What?

                         JARED COHEN
               The 1.2 trillion.

                            SAM ROGERS
               All of it?

               Yes.

                         SAM ROGERS
               I don't know, a couple weeks?

                           JARED COHEN
               Weeks?

                         SAM ROGERS
               Yes. But as you certainly know our
               business is selling AND buying. It
               doesn't work for very long without both
               components. If we suddenly stop buying
               for a day or two that just doesn't hide
               under the rug, it gets out and this whole
               this thing comes to a end... and right
               quick.

                         JARED COHEN
               I understand.

                           SAM ROGERS
               Do you?

                         JARED COHEN
               How many traders do we have left between
               your floor and Petersen's?

                         SAM ROGERS
               I don't know, sixty.

     RAMESH has been looking down at the numbers while this
     conversation has been taking place.

                         RAMESH
               Jared I've just been looking here a
               little closer, and it's these VAR numbers
               that are really setting this thing off.

     JARED holds up a hand to interrupt Ramesh. Jared nods his
     head, his eyes are perfectly still but his brain is racing.

                         JARED COHEN
               Excuse me, I need to make a quick call.

     JARED calmly stands up   and steps out of the   room for a long
     moment. The room stays   completely quiet the   whole time he is
     gone. We hear nothing.   It is awkward to say   the least. He
     comes back in and sits   down without missing   a beat.

                           JARED COHEN (cont'd)
               Please...

               I was just saying, and just speaking

               putting these in and sees the exact same
               thing we are looking at here. If they
               haven't already.

     Pause.

                          JARED COHEN
               Understood... And Sarah, what value would
               you allow to be placed on those assets
               that might be left on the books, if they
               had to be?

                         SARAH ROBERTSON
               Why would they still be on the books?

                         SAM ROGERS
               Because suddenly no one wants to buy
               them.

                         JARED COHEN
               Oh fuck you Sam... give me a fucking
               break, all at once?

                         SARAH ROBERTSON
               Without an active market, it could take
               weeks, months for me to value them
               correctly. You'd have to go block by
               block.

                         SAM ROGERS
               It's a very simple business Jared. You
               and I talked about this last year...

     JARED turns around suddenly and cuts him off.

                         JARED COHEN
               Sam.... Will, Peter, and..??

                         SETH
               Seth.

                         JARED COHEN
               Seth, Could you please excuse us for a
               few minutes.

     They stand up and start to exit the room.


                         JARED COHEN (cont'd)
               Oh and Peter? Who else has seen this?

     PETER thinks that through.

                         PETER
               No one... besides us here.

                         JARED COHEN
               And Mr. Dale.

                         PETER
               Yes.

                         JARED COHEN
               And can it really be that we don't know
               where Eric Dale is?

                         WILL EMERSON
               I'm afraid so. His wife tells us he
               hasn't come home yet...and the firm shut
               off his phone today.

                         JARED COHEN
               Perfect. Well, I need to know where he
               is.

     WILL, SETH, and PETER leave the room and close the door
     behind them.

     They cross the hallway and sit on a bench staring out the
     window. They talk very quietly.

                         SETH
               Jesus fucking Christ! Who is that guy?

                         WILL EMERSON
               He's Sam's boss.

                          SETH
               He looks like he's fifteen years old. How
               old is he?

                         WILL EMERSON
               He's like forty.

                         PETER
               How does that happen?

                         WILL EMERSON
               Oh it happens all the time. Except to me.
               Kid's a fucking killer.

                         PETER
               What are they talking about?

                  It ain't pretty.

                            SETH
                  What ain't pretty?

                            WILL EMERSON
                  If people suddenly stop buying the shit
                  we're selling....

     They all look out the window. Long pause.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  Jared you can't do what you are thinking
                  about doing.

                            JARED COHEN
                  What if we don't have a choice?

                            SAM ROGERS
                  What does that mean? Fuck you... you
                  don't have a choice.

                            JARED COHEN
                  Fuck me? Have you looked at these numbers
                  Sam??

                            SAM ROGERS
                  Yes, but what the hell do I know.

     JARED COHEN comes back over to the table and picks up the
     packet.

                            JARED COHEN
                  Well, Mr. Shah tell me if I'm wrong but
                  to me these numbers don't add up.

                            RAMESH
                  If I may I'd like to take some time
                  before we...

                            SARAH ROBERTSON
                  Jared we can't answer that yet.

                            JARED COHEN
                  Are you fucking kidding me... this is
                  exactly what we've...

     SARAH now cuts him off abruptly.

                  We need a little time before we can give
                  you our conclusion.

     SARAH closes the issue off with another look to JARED.

                            JARED COHEN
                  OK. We meet in 45 minutes.

                            RAMESH
                  Sam, do you have this file?

                            SAM ROGERS
                  Yes, here it is.

     SAM slides him the hard drive across the table, they all take
     a second to follow it.

                            JARED COHEN
                  And Sam we need Eric Dale, it's making me
                  very uneasy knowing he is out there right
                  now wanting to put a knife in our backs
                  while he's not even aware he's holding
                  the knife in his hand.

     SARAH and RAMESH leave the room as SAM is left alone with
     JARED.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  What are you going to do?

                              JARED COHEN
                  Not sure.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  Are you going to call him?

     They both look at each other for a long beat. Finally.

                            JARED COHEN
                  I already did.

     SAM puts his hand on JARED'S shoulder briefly. They part.

                            WILL EMERSON
                  Yeah, it is.

     They sit down on a girder, then light up. WILL'S look and

     Still not a word. Finally.

                  Is this really where you want to be

                  Did you know the fear most people feel
                  when they stand on the edge like this is
                  not actually a fear that they will fall
                  but instead it's the subconscious fearing
                  that they might jump? ....It's a fear of
                  losing faith.

               You can't... it's impossible. But they'll

               I don't know really. It goes pretty

               gave 150 to my parents to live off, so

               I bought a car last year for 150.
               Probably another 100 eating... 25 on
               clothes, put 400 away for a rainy day...

               125 left.

     WILL EMERSON takes a long drag off his cigarette.

                         WILL EMERSON
               I spent 76,520 dollars on booze, dancers,
               and whores.

                           PETER
               76,520?

                         WILL EMERSON
               Yeah, kinda shocked me, although I was
               able to write most of it off, as
               entertainment.

     With that he flicks his cigarette over the edge of the
     building just as a massive CORPORATE HELICOPTER comes
     sweeping up from behind the building and comes right over
     their heads.

     THEY are now YELLING above the rotor noise.

                 PETER                             SETH
     Whoa!                               Whoa!

     JARED and SAM are sitting in the office silently looking out
     the window. The office is very large and has a full sitting
     area with two couches. JARED is intensely going over the
     papers in front of him. SAM is just looking out the window.

                         SAM ROGERS

     JARED stops reading with a deeply aware look and just stares
     out the window as well.

                            JARED COHEN
                  This is a very... very bad dream.

     SAM looks over at him directly.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  I don't know, seems like we actually may
                  have just finally woken up.

     SARAH ROBERTSON comes to the door. SAM sits up.

                             SARAH ROBERTSON
                  Hello.

                             JARED COHEN
                  Come in.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  How do we look?

     Her look says it all.

                            SAM ROGERS (cont'd)
                  I should go.

                            SARAH ROBERTSON
                  No, you should stay.

                             JARED COHEN
                  So?

                            SARAH ROBERTSON
                      (dead calm delivery)
                  It's all legit... the kid killed it. The
                  formula is worthless.

     They all look at each other as if they have seen a ghost.

                            JARED COHEN
                  What do you mean?

                            SARAH ROBERTSON
                  It's broken.

                             JARED COHEN
                  There are eight trillion dollars of paper

               We were wrong.

                         JARED COHEN
               You mean you were wrong.

                         SARAH ROBERTSON
               Don't even start.... This was discussed.

                         SAM ROGERS
               I'm heading to the conference room.

                         SARAH ROBERTSON
               No.

                         JARED COHEN
               I'd like you to hear this.

                         SAM ROGERS
               No... I don't want to hear this.

     SAM stares at them both.

                         SAM ROGERS (cont'd)
               How do you think I've stuck around this
               place so long.

     He walks out of the room. SARAH and JARED look each other
     over.

                         JARED COHEN
               I've called Tuld.

                         SARAH ROBERTSON
               Is there a contingency plan here?

                         JARED COHEN
               A contingency plan?

                         SARAH ROBERTSON
               Yes.

                         JARED COHEN
               We went all in on this one.

                         SARAH ROBERTSON
               So we've got ourselves quite exposed
               here... haven't we?

                         JARED COHEN
               To Tuld or the market?

     They both stare at each other. Jared's phone buzzes. He takes
     it out and his face says it all.

                            SARAH ROBERTSON (cont'd)
               He's here.

     His face says yes. Sarah walks out. Jared stands up and
     straightens his tie in the reflection of the window. He
     exits.

               We were just grabbing a cigarette on the
               roof and a very spiffy looking helicopter
               dive-bombed us and then landed.

     All five walk in silence. Finally,

                         JARED COHEN
               Just one piece of advice to everyone here
               before we go in there... this could get a
               bit ugly but whatever you do... just...
               tell the truth... don't try to change a

               rocket scientist.

     He continues on.

     The guys are taken aback because standing right outside the

     They come through glass doors and enter a massive conference
     room with a commanding view of the city. It is filled with
     people along one side of the table. There are a team of five
     lawyers, three compliance officers, a couple of key board
     members, twelve in all. On the near side of the table sits
     RAMESH SHAH surrounded by empty chairs all alone. The head of
     the table is empty.

     They all file in and sit down. They all sit in silence...
     waiting. Finally from a side door JOHN TULD comes walking
     into the room. He is dressed in a average suit and tie, is
     not tall, late fifties and doesn't have a hair on his head.
     He carries himself without much exception. His eyes however
     tell a far different tale. Intense even at rest. He walks the
     length of the room, everyone half stands up.

                         JOHN TULD
               Please sit down.

     He then seats himself at the head of the table. Everyone in
     the room has the printout in front of them. JARED is seated
     immediately to his left, then SAM, then SARAH, RAMESH, WILL,
     PETER, and finally SETH.

               Welcome everyone. I must apologize for
               dragging you all here at such an uncommon
               hour but from what I've been told this
               matter needs to be handled urgently, so

                  So why doesn't someone please try to

     Everyone looks around the room a bit and finally JARED speaks
     up.

                            JARED COHEN
                  Well, Mr. Tuld as I mentioned earlier if
                  you look here at the top page of this
                  printout...

     He cuts him off.

                            JOHN TULD
                  Jared, it's a little early for all that,
                  how bout in English? ... Actually I'd
                  like to hear from the guy who put this
                  thing together... Mr. Sullivan is it?
                  Does he speak English?

                             JARED COHEN

                  seems to have stumbled across this mess.

                            JARED COHEN
                  Well, that's Peter Sullivan here.

     JARED looks down the table to PETER, as does everyone else in
     the room. JARED gives him a go ahead look.

                             PETER

               So Mr. Sullivan why don't you tell me
               what you think is going on here, and
               please speak as you might to a young
               child or a golden retriever, I didn't get
               here on my brains I can assure you of
               that.

     PETER is very nervous.

                         PETER
               Well, sir. As I guess you may or may not
               know I work for Mr. Rogers here as an
               associate in the risk assessment and
               management office at MBS

                         PETER
               Yes... Well as you probably know over the
               last 36-40 months the firm has begun
               packaging new MBS products that combine
               several different traunches of rating
               classification in one tradable security.
               This has been very profitable as I
               imagine you noticed.

                          JOHN TULD
               I have.

                         PETER
               Well the firm is currently doing a
               considerable amount of this business
               every day. The problem, which is I guess
               why we are here tonight, is that it takes
               us... the firm... almost a month to layer
               these products correctly thereby posing a
               challenge from a risk management
               standpoint.

                         JOHN TULD
               And Mr. Sullivan that challenge is?

                         PETER
               We have to hold these assets on our books
               longer than we might ideally like to.

                          JOHN TULD
               Yes.

                         PETER
               But the key factor is these are
               essentially just mortgages, so that has
               allowed us to push the leverage
               considerably beyond what you might be
               willing, or allowed to do in any other
               circumstance, thereby pushing the risk
               profile without raising any red flags.

                         JOHN TULD
               And how far have we pushed that profile
               tonight Mr. Sullivan?

                         PETER
               We have pushed it to 1.215 Trillion
               dollars... at MBS alone.

                         JOHN TULD
               Give or take.

                         PETER
               Give or take.

                         JOHN TULD
               Now Mr. Sullivan what I am guessing, and
               give me a little rope here, what I am
               guessing that your report here says is
               that considering the, shall we say bumpy
               road, we've been on the last week or so
               that the numbers that your brilliant co-
               workers up the line ahead of you had come
               up with in the past don't seem to make
               much sense anymore considering what's
               taking place today?

                          PETER
               Actually not taking place today but
               what's already taken place over the last
               two weeks.

                         JOHN TULD
               So what you're saying is it's already
               happened?

                          PETER
               Sort of.

                         JOHN TULD
               And Mr. Sullivan what does your model say
               that means for us here?

                         PETER
               Well, that's where it becomes a
               projection. But...

     PETER looks down at JARED for approval to go forward.

                         JOHN TULD
               You're speaking with me Mr. Sullivan.

                         PETER
               Well... sir... if those assets were to
               decrease by just 25 percent, and remain
               on our books... well... that loss would
               be greater than the current market
               capitalization of this company.

     The room goes silent. JOHN TULD looks at PETER long and hard.
     He then stands up and goes over to the window and looks into
     the city.

                         JOHN TULD
               So what you're telling me Mr. Sullivan is
               that the music appears to be about to
               stop and we are going to be holding the
               biggest bag of stinking shit ever
               assembled in the history of capitalism?

     Everyone looks back at PETER.

                         JOHN TULD (cont'd)
               Mr. Sullivan?

                         PETER
               Well sir, I'm not sure I'd put it that
               way but let me clarify using your
               analogy, what this model shows is the
               music, so to speak, just slowing, if the
               music were to stop, as you put it, then
               this model would not be even close to
               that scenario. It would be considerably
               worse.

                         JOHN TULD
               Well let me tell you something Mr.
               Sullivan. Do you want to know why I'm
               sitting here in this chair with you all,
               why I get the big bucks, so to speak?

                         PETER
               Yes.

                         JOHN TULD
               I'm here for one reason and one reason
               only.

     JOHN TULD continues to look out over the city for a long
     beat.

                         JOHN TULD (cont'd)
               I'm here to guess what the music is gonna
               do a week, month, a year from now. That's
               it, nothing more....... and I'm afraid...
               standing here tonight... that I don't
               hear... a... thing... just silence.

     The room falls completely still for at least half a minute.
     Then JOHN TULD spins around quickly with a considerably more
     upbeat tone and looks up and down the table.

                         JOHN TULD (cont'd)
               So, now that we know that the music has
               stopped, what can we do about it?

     Long Silence.

                         JOHN TULD (cont'd)
               Mr. Cohen, Ms. Robertson, I'm afraid this
               is where you are supposed to step back
               in. Lord knows we relied enough on Mr.
               Sullivan today.

     JARED and SARAH come to attention and gather their thoughts.

                         JOHN TULD (cont'd)
               What have you got for us?

     Long pause.

                         JOHN TULD (cont'd)
               What have I told you since the first day
               you walked into my office? (pause) That
               there are three ways to make a living in
               this business... Be first, be smarter, or
               cheat. Well I don't cheat, and even
               though I like to think we have got some
               pretty smart people in this building of
               the two remaining options, it sure is a
               hell of alot easier to just be first.

     The room goes silent again as Mr. Tuld stares back out the
     window.

                         JARED COHEN
               Sell it all today...

     JOHN TULD smiles just a bit. Then turns.

                         JOHN TULD
               Is that even possible Sam?

                                                         (CONTINUED)

     SAM looks across the room at JOHN TULD, they have known each
     other for 35 years.

                         SAM ROGERS
               It is, but at what cost?

                           JOHN TULD
               I'll pay.

                           SAM ROGERS
               Really?

     JOHN and SAM look and read each other.

                         JOHN TULD
               I think so.

                         SAM ROGERS
               Almost a trillion bucks of paper?

                         JOHN TULD
               Where does it come back to us?

                         SAM ROGERS
               Everywhere.

                         JOHN TULD
               Sam, I don't think you seem to understand
               what your boy down here just said... if I
               made you... how would you do it?

     SAM ROGERS looks down at the table for a long, long, beat.

                         SAM ROGERS
               You bring the traders in for their normal
               6:30 meeting and you be honest with them,
               they're gonna know it's the end either
               way, so you'd have to throw them a bone,
               and a pretty big one. You'd have to come
               out of the gate storming... 40 percent
               done by 10:15 and 70 percent of your
               positions need to be gone by eleven,
               cause by lunch the word will be out. No
               swaps, no nothing, and by two o'clock
               you'll be getting 65 cents on the dollar,
               if you're lucky, and the feds will be in
               here looking up your ass and trying to
               slow us down.

                           JOHN TULD
               Ramesh?

     He looks to RAMESH SHAH down the table.

               They'll slow you down but it's yours to
               sell. They can't stop you.

                         SAM ROGERS
               John... let's just say we pull that off,
               which is saying something... the real
               question is... who are we selling this
               to?

                         JOHN TULD
               The same people you've been selling this
               to for the last two years... and whoever
               else will buy it.

     They look at each other to see if they understand each other.

                         SAM ROGERS
               If you do this you've killed that market
               for years. It's over.

                         JOHN TULD
               (Nods.)

                         SAM ROGERS
               And you are selling something you know
               has no value.

                         JOHN TULD
                   (cuts him off cold)
               We are selling to willing buyers at the
               current fair market price, so that WE may
               survive, Sam.

                         SAM ROGERS
               You'll never sell a thing to any one of
               them again.

                         JOHN TULD
               I understand.

                         SAM ROGERS
               Do you?

                         JOHN TULD
               Do you!!! This is it, Sam, this is it!

     The rest of the table is taken aback and just watching them
     go at it. Silence.

                   Are you going to be able to come on board
                   here Sam?

      They look at each other.

                             SAM ROGERS
                   I'm not sure John. This is really ugly.

                             JOHN TULD
                   You and I are salesmen Sam, we sell.
                   That's what we do. It's not complicated.

                             SAM ROGERS
                   Exactly. And you damn well know that you
                   don't make a sale unless you think the
                   guy is gonna come back for more, and
                   tomorrow we are done.

      JOHN looks out and then over at SAM and decides whether or
      not to proceed.

                             JOHN TULD
                   This is it Sam.

                             SAM ROGERS
                   You keep saying that, what is that
                   supposed to mean?

                             JOHN TULD
                   It's the big one. Most of us aren't gonna
                   make it out of this one.

                What are you talking about?

                          JOHN TULD
                This won't be the last `situation' I will
                be having this week. It's just the start.

                          SAM ROGERS
                It's only the start because we are
                starting it.

                          JOHN TULD
                Maybe. But I don't think that's true, not
                this time. The numbers just don't add up
                anymore.

                          SAM ROGERS
                Well I agree with you there, I've been
                saying that for years.

                          JOHN TULD
                I mean if this kid can come up with
                this...?

                          SAM ROGERS
                I don't think I can go in knowing what I
                know and put the hammer down on these
                guys like this.

                          JOHN TULD
                Oh please, when did you become so soft.

                          SAM ROGERS
                Fuck you soft, you're panicking.

      The word panic slaps JOHN TULD in the face. He then calms.

                          JOHN TULD
                If you're the first one out the door Sam,
                it's not called panicking

      JOHN TULD stares aggressively at SAM.

                          SAM ROGERS
                Look, I obviously don't have all the
                information that you do. But I think this
                could destroy this firm.

      JOHN TULD turns away from SAM and heads over to a phone.

                You let me take care of that.

      Sam heads into the hallway where everyone is mingling. He
      walks over to WILL, PETER, and SETH.

                How'd that go?

                Probably.

      SAM walks out of the room. An assistant comes into the room.

                          ASSISTANT
                Gentlemen, there is some breakfast down
                the hall if you guys are hungry.

      WILL looks at the guys.

      JARED is waiting for the elevator again as SARAH walks up and
      waits with him in silence. There is a housekeeping person
      standing next to them as well. The doors open, and all three
      get in.
                                                                59.

                         SARAH ROBERTSON
               So what's the strategy here?

                         JARED COHEN
               That's where I'm headed right now,
               downstairs to work on it with my guys.

                         SARAH ROBERTSON
               No, you and I... with Tuld.

                         JARED COHEN
               I'm not sure we need one, Sarah. That's
               not the way I've ever done this.

                         SARAH ROBERTSON
                   (with distinct sarcasm)
               Please.

                         JARED COHEN
               He knows where we both have stood on this
               all along. There's nothing more to do.

     This pushes a button with her.

                         SARAH ROBERTSON
               That's exactly my point, and knowing what
               was discussed by both you and I with him,
               I don't see how that can possibly you
               with anything but a false sense of
               comfort.

                         JARED COHEN
               I'm not looking for a sense of comfort
               here, Sarah. I don't think there is one
               to be found.

     The elevator door opens and the housekeeper gets off. Sarah
     walks after her, but turns to Tuld first.

                         SARAH ROBERTSON
               So again, what's the strategy here?

                         JARED COHEN
               On this particular front, I'm just not
               sure there's much left to do.

     SARAH looks at him trying to judge the situation.

                  Of course you are well aware I filtered
                  several warnings for you and Cohen over a
                  year ago on this?

                            JOHN TULD
                  I'm not sure that's the best path for you
                  to be taking at this point... you're
                  going to be taken care of here...

                              SARAH ROBERTSON
                  (Nods)

                            JOHN TULD
                  Obviously it's quite complicated.

                            SARAH ROBERTSON
                  John I was told that in no uncertain
                  terms...

                            JOHN TULD
                  It was all a very grey area.

                            SARAH ROBERTSON
                  It was actually made very clear at the
                  time, by you and I and Cohen.

                            JOHN TULD
                  I'd really prefer that you didn't fight
                  me on this...

     TULD pauses, they look at each other.

                            JOHN TULD (cont'd)
                  We all fucked this one up pretty good...

                              SARAH ROBERTSON
                  Yes.

                            JOHN TULD
                  We need you to stay here till this is all
                  done and the markets close.

                            SARAH ROBERTSON
                  I understand.

               They'll go over the numbers with you
               downstairs... Good luck.

     JOHN TULD looks at her. There is a security person standing
     at the door who is waiting for her as he gets up and walks
     out.

     WILL and SETH are sitting waiting for WILL'S car to be
     brought up. As they wait they see JARED COHEN come out of the
     elevator and walk towards them.

                         SETH
               Ah fuck, it's Jared. He's coming this
               way.

                         WILL
               What does wonderboy want?

     WILL stands up and walks over to JARED.

                         JARED COHEN
               Do you have a minute?

                         WILL
               We're heading to get Eric Dale.

                         JARED COHEN
               I know. I just need a second.

     THEY walk away from SETH.

                         WILL
               What is it?

                         JARED COHEN
               Tuld and I have concerns that Sam may not
               be willing to step up and do the right
               thing here.

     WILL looks around the garage, than back at JARED.

                         WILL
               I don't think that's ever been a problem.

                         JARED COHEN
               Of course it hasn't, but during acute
               situations, such as this, often what is
               right can take on multiple
               interpretations.

     They look at each other for a long beat as WILL sizes up the
     question. In the background the squeals of tires on concrete
     are heard.

                            WILL
                  Sam will step up.

                            JARED COHEN
                  I know he will...but if he doesn't...

     As the question stands unfinished Will's convertible flies
     into frame down a ramp and pulls up next to JARED and WILL.
     The attendant gets out and before WILL has a chance JARED
     hands the attendant a tip. JARED then looks back at WILL who
     is waiting to get in the car.

                            JARED COHEN (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                  But if he doesn't, we need to know that
                  you will.

                            WILL
                  That I will what?

                             JARED COHEN
                  Step up.

     WILL climbs into the car and shuts the door. He looks at
     JARED through the open window with SETH now sitting next to
     him within earshot.

                            WILL
                  I have no doubt Sam will make the right
                  choice. And if it makes you feel any
                  better he and I have always had the same
                  interpretation of what's right...no
                  matter how acute the situation.

     WILL puts the car in drive and pulls out of the garage
     leaving JARED standing there.

     The floor is totally empty. Slow guitar music playing. The
     camera glides along the empty floor scanning over the many
     different empty trading stations and the hundreds of computer
     screens. It turns the corner and then finally enters SAM'S
     office.

     He is totally asleep. He has headphones on and looks like he
     could be dead he is so passed out. The music suddenly changes
     pace and the volume change startles him up. He looks around.

      He takes the headphones off, music stops. He finally stands
      up and mildly limps his way out the office

      SAM ROGERS comes across the room and over to the sinks to
      wash his hands. He looks in the mirror, and then decides to
      wash his face as well. He stares at himself in the mirror.
      The water drips off his face. He looks old. Just then the
      door opens and JOHN TULD walks into the room. He does not go
      to use any of the facilities. He stops and looks to talk to
      SAM.

                             JOHN TULD
                   There he is.

                             SAM ROGERS
                   John.

      SAM walks over and takes a towel to wipe off his hands and
      face. Finally he looks up.

                             SAM ROGERS (cont'd)
                   So what's it look like John?

      The line is delivered a bit too lightly for JOHN TULD'S
      liking.

                             JOHN TULD
                   Cohen has done a nice job. It can work.

                             SAM ROGERS
                   What does that mean?

                             JOHN TULD
                   It means, as you very well know, that you
                   are a very important piece of this
                   puzzle.

      They look directly at each other.

                             JOHN TULD (cont'd)
                   Here.

      JOHN TULD hands SAM a single piece of folded paper. SAM opens
      it and looks at it.

                             SAM ROGERS
                   That's very generous.

                            JOHN TULD
                  It's not a gift. I need to know you are
                  with me on this.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  I'm with the firm John.

     JOHN TULD is now taking a far more forceful stance, almost
     blocking the doorway.

                            JOHN TULD
                  I won't get what I need out of your boys
                  today unless they believe you... unless
                  they believe in you completely.

     He stares at SAM.

                            JOHN TULD (cont'd)
                  Are you in?

                            SAM ROGERS
                  I told you I have my reservations.

                            JOHN TULD
                  Well you can't have any reservations.

     They both stare at each other.

                            JOHN TULD (cont'd)
                  And I need to know now.

     SAM looks down at the floor then at the piece of paper in his
     hand, then long and hard at JOHN TULD.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  I'm with the firm completely John, as I
                  always have been. Excuse me.

     SAM slightly moves JOHN out of the way and then he exits, the
     door closes.

     There is a haunting blue light bouncing through the
     buildings. PETER is walking through the streets with mid-size
     headphones on his ears. The music is all we hear. He wanders
     around the almost completely empty city and the further he
     walks the less his face changes.

     PETER finally stops to get a coffee at a small street cart.
     He takes off his headphones to pay and the music stops. The
     wind blows.

                  Thank you.

     PETER turns around and starts walking but as he looks up he
     see the figure of a woman coming towards him. It is
     immediately obvious that he knows her. He stops and she keeps
     slowly walking towards him. They stop in front of each other
     squarely.

                               LUCY
                  Hey...

                            PETER
                  Hi. It's really good to see you.

     She has a very sweet face but looks tired. She appears to be
     a bartender or something, she is not dressed for banking.

                            LUCY
                  You too. You look tired.

                               PETER
                  I am.

                            LUCY
                  What are you doing here?

                            PETER
                  I never left work. Just had to get out
                  for a walk.

                            LUCY
                  You're still working there?

     This cuts him a bit, why wouldn't he be?

                            PETER
                  Yes, of course...

                            LUCY
                  Oh. I thought...

                            PETER
                  How are you? Are you happy? You look
                  happy.

                               LUCY
                  I am.

                         PETER
               Well, I should get back... How's your
               father?

     She is pleasantly surprised by this gesture.

                         LUCY
               He's good. Thanks for asking.

                         PETER
               OK. Be safe.

     He starts to leave.

                         LUCY
               Hey... You got any inside tips for him?

     This stops PETER dead in his tracks. His world tightens yet
     clarifies. Finally.

                           PETER
               Sell.

     She looks at him with concern as he doesn't even hint at a
     smile as he says this. They then give a small kiss on the
     cheek, and part.

     SARAH is sitting at her desk staring out the window. She
     calmly gets up and walks over to the door and slowly closes
     it. Then she reaches out and twists the blinds on the glass
     wall separating her office from the floor giving herself
     total privacy. She walks over to her desk and sits down. She
     reaches over and grabs a box of tissues, methodically
     preparing to cry, almost like a surgeon preparing to work.
     She sits at her desk still seemingly calm and collected. Her
     face starts to tweak just a little, but it just will not give
     way. Again she tries. And again. She can not cry. She can't
     believe it. The deeply tragic look of total failure floods
     her eyes but still hardly a twitch on her face. Still no
     tears. Finally she makes a forced noise like a sob, but it
     isn't real and she knows it. Then she tries to laugh to
     herself, she tries again to laugh, but it too is not real.
     She does feel something, but she simply and very sadly can
     only openly express even to herself... nothing.

     WILL and SETH pull up in front of a very nice large
     townhouse. They both look up at the house dreading going in.

                  He just bought it.

                            SETH
                  I hope it was with cash.

                            WILL EMERSON
                  You are such a prick, and it wasn't.

                            SETH
                  I think I should stay here.

                            WILL EMERSON
                  Get out of the fucking car.

                            SETH
                  I just don't think it would be
                  appropriate.

                            WILL EMERSON
                  Appropriate? Get the fuck out of the car.

                            SETH
                  Really?

                            WILL EMERSON
                  You're probably right... And don't touch
                  any of the fucking buttons.

     WILL gets out of the car and walks slowly up the stairs. He
     is about to knock on the door when from behind him he hears
     ERIC coming walking up the block. He is still in his work
     clothes and it looks like it's been a long night.

                            ERIC
                  What are you doing here?

                            WILL EMERSON
                  Peter finished that model you were
                  working on.

                            ERIC
                  Really?

                            WILL EMERSON
                  It's created a bit of a shit storm.

                            ERIC
                  Yeah, I bet.

                            WILL EMERSON
                  Do you want to see it... the model?

                            ERIC
                  No. But I'm pretty sure what it says.

                            WILL EMERSON
                  Do you think he's right?

                            ERIC
                  I'm sure he's right.

     They both sit down on the stoop.

                            WILL EMERSON
                  Jared Cohen called an emergency meeting
                  of the partners tonight. John Tuld has
                  decided to liquidate our entire position.

     ERIC looks over at Will

                            WILL EMERSON (cont'd)
                  Today.

     ERIC'S face doesn't show much emotion. But he is surprised
     and sincere.

                            ERIC
                  Well, I am very sorry to hear that.

                            WILL EMERSON
                  They want me to get you back there, they
                  are worried about you being out here.

                            ERIC
                      (with pleasant disgust)
                  Please.

                            WILL EMERSON
                  I'm just saying.

                            ERIC
                      (cuts him off cold)
                  Not a chance.

     WILL lets it sit for a few beats.

                            WILL EMERSON
                  This is serious shit Eric.

               You don't think I know that. I've been
               warning that cunt Robertson about this
               shit since last March.

               I signed my papers man, I'm out. They've

                         WILL EMERSON
               They'll pay...

     ERIC looks over at WILL. WILL lets him know with a look that
     they mean real money.

                         ERIC
               I've already been paid enough by them.

               Did you know I built a bridge once?

               A bridge.

                         WILL EMERSON
               No, I didn't.

                         ERIC
               I was an engineer by trade.

                            WILL EMERSON

               It cut out 35 miles each way of extra
               driving to get from Wheeling to New
               Martinsville. That's a combined 847,000
               miles of driving a day... and 25,410,000
               miles a month and 304,920,000 miles a
               year saved.

     Now ERIC'S mind is racing and he is adding up numbers as he
     goes.

                         ERIC (cont'd)
               I completed that project in 1986... 22
               years ago. Over the life of that one
               bridge that's 6 billion... 708 million...
               240 thousand miles that haven't had to be
               driven! At let's say... 50 miles an hour
               that's 134,164,800 hours... or 559,020
               days... so that one little bridge has
               saved the people of those two communities
               a combined 1531 years of their lives not
               wasted in the car... give or take.

               No problem.

     WILL looks out down the street as a black towncar comes
     pulling up to the house.

               that or they are going to fight you on
               everything, the package, the options...

     ERIC drops his head.

     WILL walks down the stairs as the town car stops in front of
     Eric's house. The windows are tinted, but they know who it
     is. WILL walks around to his car.

     WILL and SETH are driving slowly towards downtown Manhattan
     which spans up and out in front of them through the
     windshield. There is a long silence, and finally.

                            SETH
                  So, am I getting fired?

                            WILL EMERSON
                  I don't know.

     Very long pause, then he looks over at SETH and decides
     whether to tell the truth.

                            WILL EMERSON (cont'd)
                  Probably...yes...almost definitely.

     luxury car and then back into the city.

                  It was a perfect trade...I saw it coming
                  from three days away. I took my time. I
                  was in, I was out...Pish posh...And it

                  you'll have some decent cash to walk away
                  with.

                            SETH
                  Only if we can get this done, right?

                            WILL EMERSON
                  We'll get it done.

                              SETH
                  How?

                         WILL EMERSON
               I'm trying to figure that out right now.

                         SETH
               There aren't really enough willing buyers
               out there right now.

                         WILL EMERSON
               I'm trying to think of every last one of
               them I can and then I'll make them
               willing.

     This line sits there for a minute and WILL looks out onto the
     city.

                         SETH
               Are you ok with that?

                         WILL EMERSON
               I'm about to completely fuck guys I've
               been doing business with for fifteen
               years so no I'm not exactly ok with it.
               But look, every last one of them would do
               the same thing to me in a second...so it
               is what it is.

                         SETH
               I guess. And what about everyone else?

                         WILL EMERSON
               Everyone else?

                         SETH
               Normal people.

                          WILL EMERSON
               What are you a socialist? Fuck me Seth.

     WILL looks over at SETH, sizing him up, looking to see if he
     has what it takes.

                         WILL EMERSON (cont'd)
               Look, If you want to do this with your
               life, and do it well, you need to believe
               that you are necessary. And you are. If
               people want to live like this...with
               their big cars and these houses that they
               haven't even paid for. Then you are
               necessary. The only reason they can
               continue to live like kings is because
               we've got our fingers on the scale in
               THEIR favor. And if I were to take my
               finger off...

               Then the whole world gets really fucking
               fair, really fucking quickly. And no one
               wants that, they say they do...but they
               don't. They want what we're giving them,
               but they also want to play innocent and
               pretend they have no idea how we get it.
               And that's more hypocrisy than I can
               swallow. So fuck em.

     Long look out at the city ahead.

                         WILL EMERSON (cont'd)
               And tomorrow if this all goes south
               they'll crucify us for being reckless,
               but if we are wrong and everything get's
               back on track. They'll be laughing their
               arses off at us for being the biggest
               bunch of pussies that God ever let
               through the door.

     He is trying to convince himself as much as SETH. They both
     look out the windows.

                         SETH
               Are we gonna be wrong on this one?

     WILL looks into the sea of skyscrapers that now tower above
     them.

                         WILL
               No...they're all gonna get fucked.

     PETER is still walking around on the street with the music
     playing. He crosses a large open windswept corporate plaza.
     As he approaches the building he sees SAM ROGERS standing in
     front having a cigarette. He walks towards him and then
     finally decides to take off the headphones. The music stops
     and the wind kicks in.

                         PETER
               Hello.

                         SAM ROGERS
               Peter.

                  I don't smoke.

     But PETER holds his place comfortably.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  That's good. I don't much either.

                            PETER
                  It's kinda beautiful out right now.

     They both look out. Slow pacing.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  Yeah, I guess it is...
                      (almost surprised)
                  I've never really liked this town much.

                            PETER
                  How long have you been here?

                            SAM ROGERS
                  Forty years.

                            PETER
                  I think it's beautiful. The whole place.
                  Forty years, that's something... Are you
                  tired?

                             SAM ROGERS
                  Of What?... Remember I don't work as hard
                  as you do.

                            PETER
                  That's not true.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  No it is, actually.

     Long silence.

                            PETER
                  Are we all getting fired after today?

     SAM looks out and thinks about it for a while.

                              SAM ROGERS
                  Probably.

                            PETER
                  They're going to fire you?

                  You don't have to stand out here for me.

                  I don't really want to go back in there
                  just yet.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  I understand that.

     Long beat.

                            PETER
                  I think I know your son.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  Really?

                  Yeah. Not well... but, he always seemed
                  like a nice person.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  He is a nice person.

                  I guess you could say alot worse about a
                  guy.

                            PETER
                  Have you told him what's about to happen?

     They look at each other to check the nature of the question.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  What do you mean?

                  No... I hadn't even thought of it.

                  I guess it's illegal anyway?

               never get caught.

               He's already pretty rich anyway though
               right? He doesn't need the help.

     SAM ROGERS laughs quietly.

                         SAM ROGERS
               That's very true.

                         PETER
               He works with a friend of mine.

               He's a hell of alot richer than me, I
               know that much.

                         PETER
               But you are taller.

     Laughs again.

               That's true. It's not much... but it's

     A very tight shot of SETH sitting fully clothed on the toilet
     with the lid on. He is crying very, very intensely but almost
     silently. He puts his head in his hands and just once or
     twice lets out a loud noise.


                                                         (CONTINUED)
                                                                  84.
65   CONTINUED:                                                     65

     Eventually someone comes into the room and he hears the
     person go over to the sink and start running water. SETH
     tries to stop himself from crying. Eventually he accepts that
     the guy is not leaving and he comes out of the stall and
     walks over to the sinks. JARED is standing in front of the
     mirror with his shirt off shaving. His new shirt and tie are
     on a hanger next to him. SETH walks up to a sink next to him
     and it is very obvious that he has been crying. He undoes his
     collar and starts to wash his face. Finally JARED speaks.

                            JARED COHEN
                  You alright?

     SETH sends him a dagger of a look through the reflection in
     the mirror.

                            SETH
                  You just fired me.

                            JARED COHEN
                  I'm sorry...

                            SETH
                  This is all I've ever wanted to do.

                            JARED COHEN
                  Really?

                            SETH
                  Yes...

     This hits JARED just a touch.

                            JARED COHEN
                  I am sorry.

     JARED does up his tie perfectly looks at SETH again in the
     eye. Then walks out.

     SARAH ROBERTSON is sitting in a club chair staring out the
     window. The coffee table in front of her has a huge spread of
     fruit and cheese and pastries. She is not eating. She sits
     and stares. Eventually the door behind her opens, and a
     SECURITY GUY walks in with ERIC.

                            SECURITY GUY
                  They are almost ready for you Ms.
                  Robertson. Couple of minutes.

     SECURITY GUY leaves the room. ERIC looks over at SARAH then
     sits in the chair near her. Silence.

                  You as well?

                               SARAH ROBERTSON
                  Yes.

                               ERIC
                  Jesus.

                               SARAH ROBERTSON
                  Yeah.

                               ERIC
                  I'm sorry.

                            SARAH ROBERTSON
                  Thank you... Sam and the rest of your
                  floor are gone after today as well.

                            ERIC
                  Really... and Cohen?

                            SARAH ROBERTSON
                  No... still here.

                            ERIC
                  Of course...

     Long awkward pause. Eric looks around for something, anything
     to talk about.

                            ERIC (cont'd)
                  Are you still dating that tall guy...
                  from the Christmas thing?

     She looks over at him with a slight smile, giving him credit
     for trying to break the ice.

                               SARAH ROBERTSON
                  No.

                            ERIC
                  He was very tall.

                            SARAH ROBERTSON
                  6'7''......

                               ERIC
                         (quietly)
                  Wow.

     Silence.

                         SARAH ROBERTSON
               I did pass on your concerns last year...
               just so you know.

                         ERIC
               It doesn't matter.

                            SARAH ROBERTSON
               It does.

     The door swings open and a catering person comes in rolling a
     cart with another large tray with more food on it. She places
     it on the table next to the other food. The abundance is
     overwhelming.

                            SARAH ROBERTSON (cont'd)
               Thank you.

     The caterer leaves. ERIC looks around.

                          ERIC
               Have they taken all the phones out of
               this room?

     SARAH nods yes.

                         ERIC (cont'd)
               Jesus. Paranoid fucks.

                         SARAH ROBERTSON
               Yeah... I didn't think they were going to
               be able to get you back here.

     ERIC stands up and goes over to the window.

                         ERIC
               They told me they were going to drag me
               through hell on everything from my
               options to healthcare over the next two
               years or I come back and make...
                   (he looks up and does a little
                    math in his head)
               $176,471.00 an hour to sit in this room
               quietly... it wasn't much of choice.

                         SARAH ROBERTSON
               It never is.

     ERIC goes back and sits in the chair.

                         SARAH ROBERTSON (cont'd)
               Obviously looking back, the point was
               expressed with insufficient urgency...

                         SARAH ROBERTSON (cont'd)
               but your point was passed on... I need
               you to know that.

                         ERIC
               OK.

                         SARAH ROBERTSON
               Eric.

                         ERIC
               I understand, there was nothing you could
               do.

     Now SARAH questions herself.

                         SARAH ROBERTSON
               I guess... at the time... it didn't seem
               like there was much of a choice.

                         ERIC
               It never does.

     They both look at each other with miniscule smiles, then out
     the windows onto the city, defeated. Long silence.

                         SARAH ROBERTSON
               You have kids, yeah?

     Long pause as he lets her alone.

                         ERIC
               What is your package going to look like?

                         SARAH ROBERTSON
               I don't know, that's what I'm waiting for
               now.

                         ERIC
               Should be pretty good, no?

                         SARAH ROBERTSON
               It better be.

     There are 40 young, 90% male, traders jammed into the
     conference room next to the trading floor talking very loudly
     with one another. They are oblivious to what is about to
     happen. Eventually, SAM, WILL, JARED, and a firm lawyer, come
     into the room. Everyone quiets down a bit.

                            WILL EMERSON
                  Alright, hey...(whistles).

     They go silent as they notice SAM standing at the head of the
     table. JARED and the lawyer are standing off in the corner
     just to observe. SAM looks somber.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  Thank you all for coming in a little
                  early this morning, I know yesterday was
                  pretty bad, I wish I could say that today
                  is going to be less so but that isn't
                  going to be the case. Now I am supposed
                  to read this statement here to you all
                  but how bout you read it on your own time
                  and I'll just tell you what the fuck's
                  going on here.

     THE LAWYER looks at JARED then they look at SAM, he
     continues.

                            SAM ROGERS (cont'd)
                  I have spent the night here meeting with
                  the executive committee and the decision
                  has been made to begin to unwind a
                  considerable portion of the firm's
                  holdings in several key asset classes.
                  The crux of it is... in the firm's
                  thinking the party is over as of this
                  morning. There is going to be
                  considerable turmoil in the markets for
                  the foreseeable future. They believe that
                  it is better to have this turmoil begin
                  with us... as a result the firm has
                  decided to liquidate the majority of its
                  position of fixed income MBS today.

     An assistant starts handing out info packets to each of the
     traders in the room.

                            SAM ROGERS (cont'd)
                  You should be getting a breakdown right
                  now, you will see the accounts you are
                  responsible for today. I'm sure it hasn't
                  taken you long to understand the
                  implications of this sale on your
                  relationships with your counterparties
                  and as a result on your careers. I have
                  expressed this reality to the executive
                  committee and they understand. As a
                  result, if you are able to complete a 93%
                  sale of your assets you will receive a
                  1.4 million dollar one off bonus.

               If the floor as a whole is able to
               achieve a 93% sale we all get an
               additional 1.3 million a piece. Because
               of this, if you burn through your
               allotment by noon, get moving around the
               floor and start picking up other guys
               leftovers...

     SAM stops for a second and looks around the room.

                         SAM ROGERS (cont'd)
               For those of you who have never been
               through this before, this is what the
               beginning of a fire sale looks like. I
               don't have to tell any of you that the
               first hour and a half is going to be very
               important. I want you to hit every bite
               you can find. Dealers, clients, brokers,
               and your mother if she's buying...and
               obviously no swaps, its outgoing only
               today. This is obviously not the way any
               of us would like for this to be going
               down, but the ground is shifting below
               our feet, and there appears to be no
               other way out.

     SAM looks around the room again, person by person and sees
     that they indeed know what needs to be done.

                         SAM ROGERS (cont'd)
               Obviously... this is a very unique
               situation... if we are successful today
               we will have been successful in
               destroying our own jobs... I can not
               promise that each of you will be
               repositioned within the firm, but I can
               tell you that I am very proud of the work
               we have done together here, I have been
               at this here for 34 years, and I know...
               from experience people are going to say
               some nasty stuff about what we have done
               here, and what you have devoted a portion
               of your life to. But have faith that in
               the greater picture our skills have not
               been wasted, we have accomplished much,
               and our talents have served some greater
               good...

     He looks down at the ground, then back up around the room.
     Then he walks out.

     There is a very quiet energy on the floor. A low murmur. Then
     a hush falls over the floor as people pass on the info that
     the CEO, JOHN TULD is about to come onto the floor. He
     appears at one end of the floor and it falls silent. JOHN
     walks dramatically into the middle of the floor and then into
     the middle of the row in the dead middle of the floor. He
     looks around and stands in letting the drama build. Then he
     climbs up onto the desk and looks out onto the floor like a
     general.

                         JOHN TULD
               By the end of today almost everyone else
               in the world, including me, will have
               considerably less money than they began
               the day with..... You, in this room, are
               the exception. You will leave here today
               richer. You will fire the first shot, I
               wish it didn't have to be, but at times
               the market must eat its weak, and you
               all... are not the weak. We must strike
               quick, with no doubt, if you hear pause
               on the line, attack. By noon the SEC is
               going to be in here getting in your
               faces, sniffing around, you let us take
               care of them and you just keep going. We
               own what we are choosing to sell today
               and there is nothing they can do about
               it. 107 years ago this firm was founded,
               today we secure our place for next 107.
               You've got two minutes before we get
               started. Let's finish this, so we can get
               on to the next one...

     JOHN TULD climbs down from the table. SAM, who is standing
     off to the side, walks along the entire floor slowly and then
     heads into his office.

     He shuts his door as the bell rings and his office goes
     almost silent. Through the glass you see the trading floor go
     wild, then he walks over to his desk, turns around and stares
     into the four large computer screens as the charts and graphs
     begin to move. We just see the back of his head.

     INT. INVESTMENT BANK TRADING FLOOR - DAY

     Several actual individual trading sequences throughout the
     day.
                                                                   91.


     INT. SAM ROGER'S OFFICE - 4:02 PM

     The market has closed. SAM sits, staring at his computers.
     There is a knock on his door. He turns and as it opens we
     hear the sober beginnings of a quiet celebration. He looks up
     and JARED COHEN is standing in his doorway.

                            JARED COHEN
               Well done.

                         SAM ROGERS
               They did alright.

                         JARED COHEN
               I wanted to give you a heads up. They are
               going to start sending some people home
               out here.

                            SAM ROGERS
               Now?

                         JARED COHEN
               (He nods yes) Sorry. No loose ends.

                            SAM ROGERS
               Of course.

                         JARED COHEN
               For what it's worth, you're good... Guess
               somebody upstairs must really like you.

     SAM stands up and walks past JARED without another word.

     INT. TRADING FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY

     He heads down the hallway and passes the HEATHER and LAUREN
     BRATBERG from the opening scene who are returning with boxes
     to lay off more people. SAM heads off towards the elevator.

     INT. SENIOR EXECUTIVE DINING ROOM    - MOMENTS LATER

     The room has ten tables formally set that line a long wall of
     floor to ceiling windows with a commanding view of the city
     beyond. The room is empty except for JOHN TULD sitting at the
     last table. TULD looks a little surprised to see SAM but
     waves him down. SAM approaches.

                         JOHN TULD
               Sam, please sit. Congratulations are
               clearly in order.

                         SAM ROGERS
               Our guys did what they could.

73   CONTINUED:                                                       73

                            JOHN TULD
                  You did a hell of a job today, and I
                  thank you for it. Sit, excuse me for
                  eating but it's been a long day. Can I
                  get you anything?

                            SAM ROGERS
                  No, no thanks.

     They just sit in silence for a long beat as TULD takes a few
     more bites of his meal.

                            TULD
                  So what can I do for you?

                            SAM ROGERS
                  I want out.

                               TULD
                  I'm sorry?

                            SAM ROGERS
                  I'm done, I want out.

                            TULD
                  It's been a very difficult day, for
                  everyone.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  I need you to release my options, that is
                  if they're still worth anything after
                  today, and I need the bonus. I'm out.

                            TULD
                  You'll get the bonus, the options, and
                  keep your current base, but I need you to
                  stay with me for another 24 months. O.K?

     They look at each other, SAM seems to know it's not actually
     a question. SAM is a shell of himself as TULD takes another
     hearty bite of his meal. He finally looks up.

                            TULD (cont'd)
                  For God's sake man put a smile on your
                  face, you did some good today, you said
                  so yourself. I'm starting to feel a
                  little better about this whole thing.
                  You're one of the luckiest guys in the
                  world, you could've been digging ditches
                  all these years...

     SAM pushes back his chair, stands, and prepares to leave.



                                                             (CONTINUED)
                                                                 93.
73   CONTINUED: (2)                                                73

                         SAM ROGERS
               That's true, and if I had been at least
               there'd be some holes in the ground to
               show for it. I'm just not quite sure how
               we fucked this thing up so badly.

     This pushes TULD a bit too far. He also senses he may be
     losing SAM. He drops his fork, and his tone changes.

                         TULD
               Jesus, when did you start feeling so
               sorry for yourself, it's unbearable...
               What, you think we may have helped put
               some people out of business today? That
               it's all just for naught? Well you've
               been doing that everyday for almost forty
               years Sam. And if all this is for naught
               then so is everything else out there.
               It's just money, it's made up, a piece of
               paper with some pictures on it so we
               don't all kill each other trying to get
               something to eat. But it's not wrong and
               it's certainly not any different today
               than it's ever been. Ever. 1637, 1797,
               1819, `37, `57,`84, 1901, `07, 1929, `37,
               `73, and 1987... God damn did that
               motherfucker fuck me up good, 92, 97,
               2000, and whatever this is gonna be
               called. They're just the same thing over
               and over. We can't help ourselves, and
               you and I can't control it, stop it, slow
               it, or even ever so slightly alter it...
               We just react... and we get paid well for
               it if we're right... and get left by the
               side of the road if we're wrong. There's
               always been and there's always gonna be
               the same percentage of winners and
               losers, happy fucks and sad sacks, fat
               pigs and starving dogs in this world...
               yes there may be more of us today... but
               the percentages... they always stay
               exactly the same.

     They stare at each other for a long beat and then TULD looks
     down and takes another bite. He chews. He looks up again.

                         SAM ROGERS
               I'll do it John, but not because of your
               little speech, but because I need the
               money. I'm not sure how it could possibly
               be after all these years, but I need the
               money.



                                                          (CONTINUED)

     They both look at each other again, then look over and see
     JARED COHEN walking down the dining room aisle with PETER
     SULLIVAN next to him.

                         SAM ROGERS (cont'd)
               You're keeping the kid?

                         JOHN TULD
               Keeping him? He's getting promoted. It's
               all hands on deck now Sam, there's going
               to be a lot of money to be made coming
               out of this mess, we're going to need all
               the brains we can get around here.

     They look at each other one last time then SAM starts walking
     away and as he passes PETER he just gives him a slight nod.

                                          VERY SLOW FADE TO BLACK:

                                                       OVER BLACK:

     We hear the sound of someone digging in dirt with a shovel.

                                                           FADE IN:

     EXT. VERY UPSCALE OLD GROWTH SUBURBAN NYC BACKYARD- 11:00 PM 74
74

     Fade up on SAM ROGERS standing in a hole in the backyard
     digging. Next to him is a large black medical-looking bag.

     He continues to dig. Eventually the flood lights from the
     house come on and the whole back yard lights up. Then the
     door opens and a woman in her fifties wearing a bath robe and
     slippers comes out onto the deck. It is SAM'S EX-WIFE. MARY
     ROGERS. She squints towards the back of the yard.

                         MARY ROGERS
               Hello! ... I've called the police.

     SAM stops digging and looks up and leans on the shovel
     handle.

                         SAM ROGERS
               Mary.

                         MARY ROGERS
               Sam?

                         SAM ROGERS
               Yup.

                         MARY ROGERS
               What are you doing?

     She comes down off the deck and walks across the lawn up next
     to the hole.

                            MARY ROGERS (cont'd)
                  What are you doing?

                               SAM ROGERS
                  Ella died.

     MARY looks down and sees the large canine body bag.

                               MARY ROGERS
                  Oh God.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  Tumor on her liver. It was horrible.

                            MARY ROGERS
                  Well I'm very sorry.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  Yeah... I really loved that dog

                            MARY ROGERS
                  I know, but Sam you don't live here
                  anymore.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  I was driving home from the vet and this
                  is the only place I could think to bury
                  her. This is where she belongs...

     She looks at him deeply.

                            MARY ROGERS
                  Well. You should have called.

                               SAM ROGERS
                  I know.

                            MARY ROGERS
                  Are you alright? You look terrible.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  Yeah. Tough day all around.

                            MARY ROGERS
                  I heard, Sammy called.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  Is he alright?

               He said they got hammered, but got out
               alive.

                         SAM ROGERS
               Good, I was going to call him this
               morning... but...

                         MARY ROGERS
               Well, I am going to go back in to bed.
               The alarm is on so don't try to break in.
                   (Sam smiles)
               Well, you take care of yourself.

                         SAM ROGERS
               Is it alright if I finish up here?

                         MARY ROGERS
               Yes.

     MARY walks back across the lawn into the house and turns off
     the lights. SAM starts back in digging the ditch and starts
     humming a song. He keeps digging as the song he is humming
     then kicks in with the full version.
