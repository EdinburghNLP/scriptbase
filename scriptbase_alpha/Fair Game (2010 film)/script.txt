          THEN---- SPLASH! She is thrust into a bath and held under
          water. CLOSE ON her face, as the bubbles of her desperate

                                          Listen to me. Listen.

                    You have to think straight here

                    thing... Right now, you have no
                    idea what we can and cannot do.
          
          Hafiz looks in the rear view. At the floor. Deep inside
          something stirred. She saw it..
                                                                      7.

          Hafiz closes his eyes, head back. She watches him closely.

          the bar, a birthday celebration. Cuervo shots. In back,
          around a table piled high with empty Mexican plates, a group

                              VALERIE
                    Right. Retail and consumer..
                    Basically we create pooled
                    investment vehicles..
          
                              STEVE
                    Sounds high risk..
          
                              VALERIE
                    I guess. But you know..high risk,
                    high return. Pretty boring
                    actually. So what do you do?
          
          JOE arrives back to the table with a tray of drinks.

                    Joe. Would you risk taking your

                              JOE
                    Absolutely not. Far from being a
                    playground of the imagination,
                    Disneyland is actually a giant
                    clearing house for crappy
                    merchandise. And Space Mountain is
                    a major disappointment.
          
          Valerie tries not to laugh. Gives him a stern look.

          Joe closes his eyes. Valerie kicks him under the table.
          
                              JEFF
                    They look nervous. They're

                    Steve you have a two year old.
                    You're off that plane. You're

                    Joe. Two guys. On a plane. Turbans.

          Joe opens his eyes. Catches Valeries'. Everybody listens. He
          takes off his glasses. And looks at Jeff.

          watching the President over his papers.

                    They could provide these arms to
                    terrorists, giving them the means
                    to match their hatred..
          
          ACROSS THE ROOM -- beneath a wall of well-thumbed tomes, two
          year old twins, TREVOR and SAMANTHA are lost in play. Trevor
          hauls in the flex of a globe lamp on a top shelf.
          
                              PRESIDENT
                    They could attack our allies or
                    attempt to blackmail the United
                    States. In any of these cases, the
                    price of indifference would be
                    catastrophic.
          
          CRASH! -- Joe turns as the shelf GIVES WAY, and an avalanche
          of books and keepsakes buries his kids. Hollers. Tears.

          As the kids play with Heather in the lounge, Joe makes a
          coffee in the kitchen, watching the President on TV as he
          mounts the ramp. The cabin door shuts tight. A wash of rotor
          blades. The chopper lifts off.
          
          Joe takes the coffee and walks out onto the deck. He looks up

                    Last time we met I was Minister,
                    you Ambassador. Now, thanks to
                    Allah, we are free men. You're
                    growing a beard, no?

          Several analysts sit around a table, including the LEAD
          ANALYST, PAUL. Two of them are the guys who were bad-mouthing
          Valerie. Another is JOE TURNER, a dough-faced offical from
          WINPAC (Weapons Intelligence Non Proliferaton and Control).
          
                               TURNER

                    "In summer 2001 Iraq sought to
                    purchase 60,000 high alloy 7075-T4
                    aluminum tubes manufactured in
                    China. The high spec of these tubes
                    led us to conclude they were
                    intended for the enrichment of
                    uranium. In August 2001 J.

                    this report, aspects of which
                    represents the CIA's present
                    position." I'm happy to take
                    questions.
          
                              ANALYST
                    The INR concluded late last year
                    that these tubes were probably for
                    artillery use, and the DOE agreed
                    they exactly matched those used by
                    Iraq for artillery rockets.
          
                              PAUL
                    Where are the tubes?
          
                              TURNER
                    WINPAC has them. We've examined
                    them. This is my point. None of you
                    guys has even seen the tubes.
          
                              VALERIE
                    I've seen them.
          
          Everyone looks at her.
          
                              TURNER
                    And when was that?
                                                                  26.
          
          
          Valerie looks up. Slightly surprised by his tone.
          
                              VALERIE
                    When I seized them last year in
                    Jordan. When I headed the covert
                    team that intercepted them, bought
                    back samples and delivered them to
                    you guys at WINPAC.
          
          A couple of the analysts try not to smile.
          
                              TURNER
                    So I take it you're not a nuclear
                    expert. These tubes are an EXACT
                    match for those developed by German
                    scientist Gernot Zippe in the 50s.
          
          Valerie turns to her notes from her reading.
          
                              VALERIE
                    You're right. I'm no nuclear
                    expert. But Dr. Houston Wood, at
                    Virginia U atomic facility is. He
                    also knows Dr Zippe, who's 89 and
                    lives in Austria, and he told him
                    that the wall thickness of the
                    Iraqi tubes was three or four times
                    the thickness of his design.
          
                              PAUL
                    And the tubes are twice as long as
                    Zippe's design. In fact the only
                    similarity between his tubes and
                    the alumumium tubes is that they're
                    made of aluminium.

                    gas centrifuges since 1952.
          
          The chauvanist analysts share a look of respect for Valerie.
          Still Turner doesn't give up.
          
                              TURNER
                    I went to Vienna. Canada. I've
                    worked on this for months. They're
                    centrifuges. Fact.
          
                              PAUL
                    So basically, they're your tubes
                    and if we don't let you win you're
                    going home.
                                                                    27.
          
          
                              TURNER
                    That's pathetic.
          
                              VALERIE

                    increase in the nation's annual
                    output of uranium. A sale that size

                    The droughts of the 80s and 90s
                    were met by millions of dollars of
                    U.S Aid, which continues to this
                    day. It just doesn't make sense
                    Niger would compromise this
                    lifeline. For that reason, and the
                    others I've given, it's my opinion
                    that the sale couldn't happen.

                                                                  37.

                    He thinks I don't know how serious
                    it is.. weeks and weeks of fifteen
                    hour days, we've gone back over and
                    over it.
          
                              PAUL
                    OK. I'll handle this.

                              PAUL
                    And so apart from all the
                    scepticism surrounding the
                    specification, the analysis from
                    the IAEA which I believe is
                    numbered in the report..
                        (Stops. Changes tack)
                    Mr Libby. Energy department nuclear
                    scientists are among the most
                    boring people on the planet. They
                    can talk about gas centrifuges
                    until you want to jump out of a
                    window. And maybe once every ten
                    years someone comes along and says
                    "so, tell me about gas
                    centrifuges". That's literally the
                    only time you should listen to
                    these guys. If they say an
                    aluminium tube is not for a gas
                    centrifuge it's like a fish talking
                    about water. We've been over this
                    data with you now five, six times.
                    And... We don't really know how you
                    want us to play this..
          
          Libby listens. He nods. Waits.

                    Let me level with you here Paul. I
                    don't know what these tubes are
                    for. From everything you're saying,
                    there could be something to this,
                    but very likely not, right?
          
                               PAUL
                    Exactly.

                    May I ask a question? When you say
                    we don't really know how to play
                    this, what do you mean?

                    Except you didn't say `I' you said
                    `we'. So you and the others have
                    discussed how to "play" these
                    briefings. Why does the CIA feel
                    the need to play these briefings?
          
                              PAUL
                    No. I mean that.. Ok. I didn't mean
                    what I just said.

                    You don't know why I'm here do you?
                    In 1991 the United States invaded
                    Iraq, and afterwards weapons
                    inspectors discovered Saddam was
                    six months off enriching uranium to
                    sufficiently high specification to
                    make a nuclear bomb. He had fissile
                    material. And not a single person
                    at the CIA, from the DCI down to
                    the janitor had the slightest clue
                    that such a program even existed.
                    So now, one decade on, are you
                    telling me that you're 100% sure
                    these tubes are not intended to
                    create nuclear weapons?
          
                              PAUL
                    I..Sir..OK. With intelligence,
                    nothing's 100 percent.

                    So. What? Are you.. Ninety nine
                    percent sure? Ninety eight?
          
                              PAUL
                    You can't put an exact figure. You
                    can't be that precise.
          
                              LIBBY
                    But if you had to say, could you
                    say you're ninety seven percent
                    sure? Is there a three percent
                    chance you've got this wrong? Or
                    four? Or five? Still pretty good
                    odds. You like those odds Paul? You
                    willing to put your name to that.
                    Are you ready to make that call?
          
                              PAUL
                    I don't make the call, Sir-.
          
                              LIBBY
                        (Fixing him)
                    Yes you do Paul. Each time you
                    interpret a piece of data. Each
                    time you choose a "maybe" over a
                    "perhaps" you make a call. A
                    decision. And right now you're
                    making lots of little decisions
                    adding up to a big decision and out
                    there's a real world where millions
                    of people depend upon you being
                    right. But what if there's a one
                    percent chance you're wrong. Can
                    you say for sure you'll take that
                    chance and state, as a fact, that
                    this equipment is not intended for
                    a nuclear weapons programme?

                    I don't know where you go. Who you
                    meet. If you're in some jail, or
                    lying in some ditch in Jordan,
                    Beirut. And if you go missing, I
                    can't tell anyone because you were
                    never there. I'd never know what
                    happened. I don't know where you
                    go.

                    Have a nice day.
          
          She shuts the door, leaving Joe alone. He walks through to
          the kitchen, looks at the fridge, one by one he takes all the
          notes off, then, deliberately, drops them in the bin.

                    convention over there. Before that,
                    in `83, he came here for an
                    engineering conference. Twice in

                    in contact. It's difficult.

                    He could come here Sawsan. He's an
                    expert physicist. He'd have a job,
                    his children, his family would be
                    safe. You, your daughter could see
                    him whever you want. Sawsan. Can

                              SAWSAN
                    I won't do anything to help you. I
                    don't know you. I would only do
                    this for Sa'ad.

          The elevator opens and a tea trolley stops outside room 1201.
          The door is opened by Valerie's colleague. Ali. It is wheeled
          inside. As Ali signs, cups of tea are poured.

          He carries one into THE BEDROOM and hands it to Sawsan, who
          sits on the edge of a bed wearing a long black traditional
          Abaya. There are two other agents there, with Valerie. One of
          them is holding a notebook..
          
                              AGENT 1
                    The pages of this notebook are fast
                    burning. You write on them like
                    normal, but if you need to destroy
                    them in an emergency..
          
          He whips out a zippo. Sets fire to one. It's gone in a flash.
          
                              AGENT 1
                    You have two of these in your
                    luggage. Now this is the only pen
                    we want you to use..
          
          The other agent shows her a pen.

                    The ink in this pen is visible for
                    10 seconds. Only when given the the
                    correct chemical fixative can it be
                    read.
          
                              SAWSAN
                    - I am not taking any of this. If
                    the Mukhbarat find any of this they
                    will do things to me you cannot
                    imagine. Tell me what you need to
                    know. I will memorise it.
          
                               AGENT 2
                    Ma'am, we have 50 very specific
                    questions, some extremely
                    technical.
          
                              SAWSAN
                    You have 206 different bones in
                    your body. Do you want their names
                    in english, latin or arabic?
          
          They look to Val for a decision. She can't help but smile.

                    How do you feel?
          
          She's trying to drink her tea, but she's shaking. Val takes
          her hand and silently grips it.
                                                                     46.
          
          
                              VALERIE
                    Just remember, if anyone asks you
                    anything, if anyone stops you stay
                    calm and tell the truth. You're
                    just visiting your brother. Keep it
                    simple and keep to the truth.
          
                              SAWSAN
                    Except it's not the truth.
                    How do you do it?
          
          She searches Valerie's face.
          
                              SAWSAN
                    How do you be someone you're not?
                    How do you lie to someone? To their
                    face. How do you do it?
          
          Valerie looks at her. Before she can answer we --

          it. Valerie and Sawsan look up from the edge of bed.

          Sawsan rolls her suitcase into the terminal. At the door she
          glances behind her...and disappears inside.
          
          Ali and Valerie get out the car looking every bit like
          tourists, suitcases, sunglasses, guidebook etc.

          Valerie aims her zoom lens camera and as if appraising it as
          a purchase, firing off some shots of the Iraqi agents.
          
          Sawsan reaches the desk and is stopped by the two men.
          
          They watch her talking to the men, handing over her passport.

          The Iraqi agent stares at her. He asks a question in arabic
          No subtitles. Sawsan responds. She remains cool, almost
          disinterested. The men exchange sentences of arabic.

                    There's a story in The New York
                    Times this morning. I want to
                    attribute The Times. I don't want
                    to talk about specific intelligence
                    sources but it's now public that he
                    has been seeking to acquire the
                    kinds of tubes that are necessary
                    to build a centrifuge.

                      Is Iraq's regime of Saddam Hussein
                      right now a clear and present
                      danger to the United States?

                      There is no doubt that Saddam
                      Hussein's regime is a danger to the
                      United States and to its allies, to
                      our interests. The problem here is
                      that there will always be some
                      uncertainty about how quickly he
                      can acquire nuclear weapons. But we
                      don't want the smoking gun to be a
                      mushroom cloud.

                    I've been a government employee for

                      Ambassador Wilson is the last
                      American diplomat to meet with
                      Saddam Hussein. In 1990, when
                      Saddam threatened to execute anyone
                      sheltering foreigners, Wilson
                      appeared at a press conference
                      wearing a noose around his neck,
                      declaring, "If the choice is to
                      allow Americans to be taken hostage
                      or be executed, I will bring my own
                      fucking rope." Saddam backed down
                      and Wilson evacuated several
                      thousand. He came home and was
                      taken to the Oval Office where the
                      President introduced him to the War
                      Cabinet as an American hero.

                    hundred scientists at the Safa
                    factory. In `91 it was blanket
                    bombed by B52s. Hussein Kamel,
                    Saddam's son in law, kept the
                    scientists together, threatening to
                    kill them if they tried to leave.
                    But sanctions destroyed the
                    economy, and when Kamel was
                    executed in `95, the team just
                    drifted apart. They're all say the

                    I haven't seen the intelligence.
                    I'm not qualified to comment. We
                    have intelligence services working
                    hard to assess just this. But I
                    have met Saddam. I've looked him in
                    the eye, so I can tell you what I
                    saw. During a particularly vicious
                    period of bloodletting in the late
                    eighties, Saddam was asked by his
                    foreign minister why he had
                    executed a certain official who had
                    been a loyal supporter. He said he
                    would rather kill a friend in error
                    than allow an enemy to live. For
                    me, that is the mark of a monster.

                    and the world is outlaw regimes that seek
                    and possess nuclear, chemical and
                    biological weapons.

                    U.S. intelligence indicates that Saddam
                    Hussein had upwards of 30,000 munitions
                    capable of delivering chemical agents.
          Joe glances at the TV as he pays.

                    From three Iraqi defectors we know that
                    Iraq, in the late 1990s, had several mobile
                    biological weapons labs.

                    The International Atomic Energy Agency
                    confirmed in the 1990s that Saddam
                    Hussein had an advanced nuclear weapons
                    development program, and was working
                    on five different methods of enriching
                    uranium for a bomb. The British
                    government has learned that Saddam
                    Hussein recently sought significant
                    quantities of uranium from Africa.
          JOE stares, motionless, at the screen. The only one awake.

                    Our intelligence sources tell us that he has
                    attempted to purchase high-strength
                    aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear
                    weapons production.

                    This nation fights reluctantly, because we
                    know the cost, and we dread the days of
                    mourning that always come. We seek
                    peace. We strive for peace. And sometimes
                    peace must be defended.

                    We Americans have faith in ourselves, but
                    not in ourselves alone. We do not claim to
                    know all the ways of Providence, yet we

                    in the loving god behind all of life and all of
                    history. May he guide us now, and may God

          COLIN POWELL'S PERFORMANCE in New York at the U.N.
          
          Aluminium tubes. Yellowcake. The Nuclear program.
          
          She watches motionless. She looks at Mike.
          
          INT. SA'AD'S HOUSE. BAGHDAD. NIGHT.
          
          Sa'ad sits in his kitchen while his wife plays with the
          children next door. HE IS WATCHING THE SAME THING: Colin
          Powell in the U.N. He catches his wife's eye through the open
          door. Slowly he shakes his head.
          
          Our eye moves off - across the TV - past the photo of SAWSAN
          and daughter - out of the window to the street outside.
          
          Cars. Buses. Stalls. Children playing. The end of a long day.
          
          SLOWLY THE SHOT DECAYS IN A TIME DISSOLVE to
          
          NIGHT -- THREE MONTHS LATER --
          
          In the full force of an air-raid. Many of the same buildings
          are gone. The whole world shakes and trembles as a PAVEWAY
          GE101 laser guided bomb streaks in and impacts..
          
          Dust. Shrapnel. Cars on fire. A vision of utter hell.
          
          A FIGURE -- DARTS BETWEEN BURNING CARS, clutching a bag of
          food, amid the firestorm. He disappears into our building.
          Our eye leaves the street - back inside: Sa'ad bursts in as -
          
          Another missile lands nearby. The building shakes. The
          picture of Sawsan shifts. Dust falls like fine rain over the
          small kitchen. Sa'ad unpacks food on the rickety table. Under
          it, his wife, children cower. He passes down bread. Cheese.
          The baby is crying.
          
          There is a KNOCK AT THE DOOR. On the other side are two men.

                      yesterday claimed in a piece in the

                      mispoke in his State of the Union
                      Address in January, concerning
                      claims that Saddam sought 500 tons
                      of Yellowcake from Niger. Wilson,

                      Look. There's zero, nada, nothing,
                      new here. The President's statement
                      in the State of the Union was much
                      broader than the Niger question.

                      Is the President's statement
                      correct?
          
                                FLEISCHER:
                      Yes, I see nothing that goes
                      broader that would indicate that
                      there was no basis to the
                      President's broader statement. But
                      specifically on the yellow cake,
                      the yellow cake for Niger, we've
                      acknowledged that that information
                      did turn out to be a forgery.

          Valerie looks ahead. Her eyes flick to the Paper on a

          Valerie sits stock still in front of a large desk at Langley.
          
          The door opens. The DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS enters with a
          fifty something woman. He sits at the desk. She sits next to
          him. BEHIND HER -- in the corner, sits a third man. He

          INT. EMPTY OFFICE. DAY
          
          Valerie enters an empty office. The door is closed behind
          her. On the desk is a notepad and a telephone. She sits.
          
          She picks up the phone. The phone isn't connected.
          
          She sits staring at the blank page.
          
          SUDDENLY -- She gets up and walks out. At the end of the

          Bursting into her office, she sits. Starts typing fast. She

                    Why did you do it?
          
                              VALERIE
                    What?
          
          Valerie is still.
          
                              DIANA
                    Every conversation. For twenty
                    years. Thousands of phone-calls.
                    You lied to me on every single one.
                    Nineteen years. Birthdays. My
                    wedding. You're my best friend Val.
          
          Diana has tears in her eyes.
          
                              VALERIE
                    Diana. I know it's hard to
                    understand, but it..
          
          They look at each other. Valerie really struggles. Then:
          
                              VALERIE
                    It becomes normal.

                              VALERIE
                    I know this is strange for you. And
                    you may not feel like it's, but I
                    need you right now. Because I'm-

                    What? What are you? My ol' pal Val?
                        (Valerie is silent.)
                    I have photos. Hundreds and
                    hundreds of photographs with this
                    person. And..

                              DIANA (cont'd)
                    I'm sitting here, and I know the
                    face, I've known it half my life.
                    What else do I know? Who are you?
          
          Valerie sits there, very still.
          
          INT/EXT. CAR (MOVING). DAY.
          
          Valerie drives home past the Capitol, still.
          
          THE CAR PULLS UP AT THE PLAYGROUP.
          
          Valerie gets out and sleep-walks into the building.
          
          She joins a small group of mothers watching through glass
          door, their children playing. One of the mothers nudges
          another and whispers something. They both look at Valerie,
          who tenses.
          
          THROUGH THE GLASS
          
          Her kids put their coats on and come out. Valerie puts on a
          bright smile. Kneels to hug them.
          
                              VALERIE
                        (Brightly)
                    Hey guys. How was your day?
          
          She carries them out, watched by the other mothers.
          
          EXT. CHARLSTON TERRACE. DAY.
          
          Valerie bussles the kids out of the car. A neighbor is mowing
          his lawn. She tenses as he slows his pace to study her.
          
          Another neighbor, searching for his keys stops and watches
          her too, as she takes the kids into the house.
          
          INT. WILSON HOUSE. DAY.
          
          Valerie and the kids come inside. The phone is ringing.
          
                              VALERIE
                    Hello.

                    Hello.

                    Your husband is a fucking
                    communist. I hope you die you
                    fucking communist whore.
          
          She puts the phone down. Frozen. Shaking.
                                                                    86.

                    Mommy. Trevor won't let me go on
                    his tractor.
          
          All at once, the facade crumbles. VALERIE closes her eyes and
          is wracked with sobs. When she opens them Sam is terrified.
          
                              SAMANTHA
                    Mommy.
          
                              VALERIE
                    It's OK honey. Mommy's just tired.
          
          She hugs her. Crying. Samantha strokes her mom's hair.
          
          INT. KIDS BEDROOM, WILSON HOUSE. NIGHT.
          
          Valerie reads a storybook to her twins.

                    So the caterpillar built a cocoon
                    and it stayed safe inside for
                    weeks. And when it emerged it was a
                    beautiful butterfly..

          She closes the door on her sleeping children. She goes next
          door into--
          
          INT. VALERIE AND JOE'S BEDROOM. NIGHT
          
          She goes into her closet. Removes a box. Then she taps a code
          into a small safe and removes another box. Alone, Valerie
          opens the first box. Photographs of herself with her friends.
          At college. People's weddings. Birthdays. Valerie and her
          girlfriends all smiling back at us. Holidays with the same
          friends. On a hen night.
          
          She opens the second box: Different currencies. Credit cards,
          photos of her with different people. Half a dozen passports.
          American. A couple Canadian. EU. She looks at the photos.
          Different names. Hair colour. She puts them back in the box.
          Carefully, and shuts the lid tight shut. She looks at herself
          in the mirror. The doorbell rings and Valerie gets up.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          VALERIE opens the front door. Standing there is Sawsan.
          
                              VALERIE
                    Sawsan. What are you doing here?
                                                                   87.
          
          
                              SAWSAN
                    Your name and address are all over
                    the web. There's even a picture of
                    your house..
          
          Valerie tries to take this in. Sawsan steps forward --
          
                              SAWSAN
                    Sa'ad has disappeared. His wife,
                    his children are missing.
                    My uncle in Mansour. He said they
                    were targeting them. They were
                    killing them..
          
                              VALERIE
                    Who?
          
                              SAWSAN
                    Sa'ad's colleagues. Dr Habbuck was
                    shot dead in the street. Dr Falli
                    was murdered in his hallway.
                    They're killing them.
          
                              VALERIE
                    Sawsan, listen to me-
          
                              SAWSAN
                    I know you can't tell me where he
                    is. Just tell me you have him. I
                    beg you. Please. I don't need to
                    know anything. Just tell me he's
                    safe.. He's my little brother.
                    Please. If you have him, if he's
                    somewhere...
                        (She starts to cry.)
                    Please. Please, I beg you. Do you
                    have him. I have to know.
          
          Valerie speaks quietly.
          
                              VALERIE
                    We don't have him.
          
          Sawsan closes her eyes. She sobs.
          
                              SAWSAN
                    You said he would be safe. You said
                    we would help. You promised-
          
          VALERIE approaches. Sawsan withdraws.
          
                              SAWSAN
                    I trusted you.
                                                                   88.
          
          
          She turns her back and walks away. Leaving Valerie alone.

          EXT. STREET IN GEORGETOWN SUBURB. NIGHT
          
          Valerie's boss MIKE is watching TV with his wife and kids and
          her mother, when the doorbell rings. He gets up.
          
          The front door opens. Valerie is standing there.
          
                              MIKE
                    Valerie. What are you doing here?
          
          Mike steps forward and closes his front door. Mike glances up
          and down the street.
          
                                                             CUT TO:
          
          A garage door opens. Valerie and Mike step into his garage
          and fluorescent light flickers on to reveal boxes of
          Christmas decorations etc-
          
                              VALERIE
                    Falli. Habbuck. Who else?
          
                               MIKE
                    Valerie-
          
                              VALERIE
                    Who else Mike?
          
                              MIKE
                    I don't know what you're talking
                    about.
          
          She fixes him. Eventually he shrugs.
          
                              MIKE
                        (He shrugs)
                    You were right. It's all about the
                    scientists. We made a call.
          
                               VALERIE
                    A call?
          
                               MIKE
                    We passed your case files to
                    liason. You know yourself we're not
                    great at this stuff.
                        (Off her shock)
                    Val, Mossad were already on the
                    same page.

                              MIKE (cont'd)
                    They've been trying to hunt these
                    guys down since the invasion.

                    You've..
                        (She stops. Looks at him.)
                    We're killing them. We're killing
                    the scientists.

                    You'll drive them underground.
                    They'll run straight to Iran.
                    Pakistan.
          
                              MIKE
                    Valerie. This isn't your problem
                    anymore.
          
                              VALERIE
                    It's not my problem. It's not my
                    problem. How can you sleep when you
                    know-
          
                              MIKE

                    I sleep just fine. Now Carol's
                    mother is here. I'm going to have
                    to ask you to leave.

          She turns and walks out.
          
          EXT. STREET. NIGHT.
          
          Valerie gets in her car. Shaking. Shuts the door. She holds
          her head in her hands and starts to sob.
          
          We hear the sound of a crowd cheering..

                    At the end of the day, it's of keen
                    interest to me to see whether or

                    marched out of White House in

                    My wife and I have never sought
                    publicity. But I know when I tell
                    her about how much support there
                    was here today, I know how thrilled
                    and humbled she'll be.

                              PAVITT
                    Thank you for coming here today.
                    I wanted to convey my outrage to
                    you in person. In all my
                    experience, nothing has disgusted
                    me like this business.

                    I know it's not easy for you, but I
                    want you to know how much the
                    agency appreciates your silence in
                    the light of this matter. We know
                    how damaging this has been to you.
                    We can't afford for this knife
                    fight to go on any longer.

                    I get death threats every day.
                    People threatening to kill my
                    husband. Hurt my children. I went
                    to the agency and I requested
                    security to protect my family. It
                    was declined. Because quote "My
                    circumstances fall outside budget
                    protocols." If this is a knife
                    fight, right now, Sir - we're
                    fighting it alone.

                    Joe Wilson versus the White House.
                    Well, all I can say is Good Luck.
                    But as a friend, I feel I should
                    tell you that those men..
          
          He points down the hill at the White House.
          
                              PAVITT
                    Those few men in that building over
                    there, that small white house, are
                    the most powerful men in the
                    history of the world. How much of a
                    stretch do you think it would be
                    for them to take on Joe Wilson?
          
          He looks at her.

                    But I know we can trust you. Speak
                    to your husband.
          
          He turns and walks off, leaving her alone, looking at the
          White House.

                    Today Special Prosecutor Patrick

                    enquiry into the leaking of the
                    identity of a covert agent
                    announced that he is convening a
                    Grand Jury to investigate the
                    affair. Among the blizzard of
                    subpoenas issued are ones for the
                    Vice President's chief of Staff
                    Scooter Libby, and special advisor
                    to the President Karl Rove. Both
                    men are under suspicion of having
                    leaked the agent's name to
                    reporters in order to damage former
                    Ambassador Joseph Wilson, a vocal
                    and combative critic of the

                    My word. You have to speak up. You
                    have to go on record.

                    You have to defend us. Now.
          
          She's cornered. Shakes her head in frustration.
          
                              VALERIE
                    So what do you want me to do Joe?
                    Go to the papers like you did?
                    Write a piece in the New York
                    Times? You know I'd have to submit
                    it to the Agency, and they'll-
          
                              JOE WILSON
                        (Interrupting)
                    The agency? The.. Wait.. Is this
                    the same Agency which won't give
                    you protection for your children?
                    Is this the same CIA that's erased
                    your pension? Where's your loyalty
                    Val? To your husband or the CIA?
          
                              VALERIE
                        (Shouts louder)
                    It's to MY FAMILY. I put my family
                    first. ALWAYS. Were you putting
                    them first when you wrote that
                    fucking article?
          
          People are looking over. The children notice. JOE is stung
          into silence.

                    I'm taking different routes to and
                    from school. I'm looking in empty
                    rooms..under the beds every time I
                    come home. A home we're going to
                    lose because your work has dried up
                    and your clients are running for
                    cover. What has all this achieved?
                    What changed Joe? Who won?
          
                               JOE WILSON

                    Maybe you're right. Maybe I should
                    have kept my mouth shut. Is that
                    what your dad taught you Valerie?
                    That what Colonel Sam Plame said?

          She stops. SAMANTHA is watching them. She has tears in her

          carries them off. Joe is alone.

                    published information that showed
                    Joe Wilson had lied about how he
                    came to be sent to Niger. He
                    denied that his wife had any role
                    in it whatsoever, but a memo Plame
                    wrote on February 12, 2002 proves

                    let some air ­ a lot of air - out
                    of Joe Wilson's overly inflated ego
                    when it issued its first report on
                    prewar intelligence. While the
                    committee heaped most of its
                    criticism on the Central
                    Intelligence Agency for getting
                    almost everything wrong about Iraq
                    and weapons of mass destruction it
                    pointedly rebuked the former
                    ambassador and his infamous mission
                    to Niger.
          
          EXT. HOUSE. DAY.
          
          Morning. Joe, in a suit, comes out of his house. A gaggle of
          reporter is waiting, they follow Joe as he crosses into the
          street towards his car. Shutters and flashbulbs firing.
          
                              REPORTER
                    Mr Wilson, do you still maintain
                    the Vice President's office sent
                    you Niger and not your wife?

                    Mr Wilson was Niger just a free
                    holiday? A boondoggle?
          
                              JOE WILSON
                    My wife did not send me. I didn't
                    receive payment. It was not a
                    holiday. It was a fact finding
                    mission in the run up to a war. But
                    the fact is no one wanted facts.

                    Mr. Wilson is it true you donated
                    money to the Kerry campaign?
          
                              REPORTER
                    People are saying your wife does

                              REPORTER
                    Is it true she was just a secretary

          Joe turns round, furious, as if he's going to punch the
          reporter. He tenses his jaw.
          
                              JOE WILSON
                    No comment.
          
          Joe gets into his car. The questions roaring around him.
          
          INT. HOUSE. NIGHT.
          
          Valerie is alone. In bed. Watching TV. FOX NEWS. Rogers.
          
                              GUEST
                    The question still remains, who is
                    Valerie Plame? Was she really
                    simply a glorified typist?
          
                              ROGERS
                    Well, I think it's really all about
                    the money. We're talking about a
                    third-rate CIA agent who had a
                    government salary, and she had sent
                    her husband to Niger, and he had
                    come back and didn't give the
                    report to the CIA, but he turned it
                    over in an op-ed to The New York
                    Times. So she was already in the
                    hot seat with the CIA, and so now
                    she's all about the money. Plus
                    it's come out that she was
                    considered kind of a mediocre agent
                    at best.
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
          
          Joe puts a sheet on the couch. He looks around for something
          to use as a pillow.
          
          INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT.
          
          Joe comes into the bedroom to get his pillow. Valerie is
          lying in the bed, turned away. He pauses in the doorway.
          
          We see Valerie up close. She begins to speak.
          
                              VALERIE
                    When we were at the "Farm",
                    training to be field officers, they
                    picked four or five of us and told
                    us we'd stood out.
          
          FLASH---- Valerie, kneeling, blindfold, in stress position.

                    We were bound, hooded and thrown in
                    separate cells. They beat us.
                    Deprived us of sleep. All you had
                    to do was give up the name of one
                    of the others. Just one name. For a
                    glass of water. A sandwich. To
                    avoid another punch.

                              VALERIE
                    Another hour in a stress position.
          
          FLASH -- VALERIE bursts out from under the water. Gasps in a
          draft of air.
          
                              VALERIE
                    They push you until they find it.
                    Til they find the point at which
                    you break. Because they have to
                    know. You have to know. And one by
                    one, everybody broke. Except me. I
                    never broke.
                        (she looks at him)
                    I've been in situations, places
                    where I was afraid. Where if you
                    made a mistake, one tiny mistake,
                    at any moment..
                        (Pause)
                    But I never made a mistake. And
                    that made me feel special. I
                    thought: I'm Different. Bullet-
                    proof. You can't break me. I don't
                    have a breaking point.
                        (Pause)
                    I was wrong.
          
          Joe comes over. He reaches out and touches Valerie.
          Immediately she gets up and walks out.
          
          Alone, he hears the bathroom door close.

          Valerie puts the kid's coats on. The study door is open. She
          knows Joe is there but she doesn't look at him nor he at her.
          
                              VALERIE
                    OK. Say goodbye to your father.
          
          The kids go into -- THE STUDY -- Joe looks up.

          In the hallway Valerie waits.

          Val looks downstairs. In the shop, her father, in an apron.

          INT. BASEMENT WORKSHOP. DAY.
          
          A wide workbench. Tools in neat rows. Valerie's father, an
          old man in a plaid shirt holds a sander. Points to the table
          he's working on.

                      It's cherry. I thought it'd work in
                      your dining room. I can see the
                      great and the good of Washington
                      eating off this thing for years to
                      come. Just sanding her down then
                      she done.

                      It's beautiful.
          
                                VALERIE'S MOM
                          (calling down)
                      Sam. I keep telling you. They have
                      a table.
          
          Valerie smiles at her Dad who looks at her properly.
          
                                LT. COLONEL SAM PLAME
                      Well come here.

          INT. FOUR SEASONS HOTEL. DAY.
          
          Joe walks across the floor. He shakes hands with three or
          four businessmen.
          
                                JOE WILSON
                      Good morning.
          
          They all introduce themselves. Joe orders breakfast.

                      She's fine. She's well. She uh..
          
          He uses the waitress to change the subject.
          
                                JOE WILSON

          Joe washing his hands in the bathroom. Tense. He looks tired.
          
                                                             CUT TO:
          
          Joe comes out of the bathroom and walks across the foyer and
          back to his table. A woman is talking to his business
          associates. He sees who it is, instantly looks concerned.
          
                              JOE
                    Can I help you? Excuse me. Can I
                    help you?

                    has stabbed our troops the back.
          
          Joe is trying to laugh it off. But everyone is watching.

                    How   dare you talk about my wife?

                    Fuck you. Fuck you.
          
          Joe storms away. OUT OF THE FOUR SEASONS
          
          Into the street -- He doesn't know what just happened. He
          hails a TAXI. It tears past. He hails another. It stops.

                    Pallisades.
          
          The driver drives. Joe tries to calm down, but in the back of
          this cab, it all hits him and he starts to lose it. He looks
          sick. His head is exploding. The tension like a vice. He
          opens the window. He gets himself under control, but he's
          white and shaking. The cab driver looks in the rear-view.
          
                                TAXI DRIVER
                    You OK?
          
                                JOE WILSON
                    I'm fine.
          
                              TAXI DRIVER
                    You're him. I see you on the TV.
                    You're Joe Wilson.
          
                              JOE
                    No, I'm not.
          
                              TAXI DRIVER
                    Yes brother. I see you on the TV.

                              TAXI DRIVER
                    No no. I know you. My name is Joe
                    too. I am from Sierra Leone.
                    Freetown. You've been there, right.
                    You like Freetown?
          
          Joe looks out of the window.
          
                              JOE WILSON
                    Joe, we both know Freetown's a shit-
                    hole.
          
          The taxi driver cracks up.
          
                              TAXI DRIVER
                    That's the truth. That's the truth
                    right there, brother. Yes indeed.
                    Sierra Leone is dying. The people
                    at the top have too much power. WAY
                    too much power. Over there we have
                    no truth. Just power. People can't
                    see that from here. Over here it's
                    a different world.
          
          Joe stares out the window.
          
                              JOE WILSON
                    I wouldn't be so sure of that.
          
                              TAXI DRIVER
                    How can you say that? Land of the
                    Free, brother. Home of the Brave.
          
          Joe looks sick.
          
                              JOE WILSON
                    Can we pull over. I'm going to
                    walk. Look keep the change.
          
                              TAXI DRIVER
                    Do you pray, Joe Wilson?
          
                              JOE WILSON
                    No.
          
                              TAXI DRIVER
                    I give you this. It is my church
                    maybe you come. And if you open a

          Valerie's father is teaching the kids how to lassoo a pole.
          They both want to go first. He tries to keep the peace.
          
          FROM THE KITCHEN -- Valerie and her mother watch.

          Sunset. Midges swirl in dizzy soups. Out in the field,

                        (Stops)
                    What are they called? I know their

                    I'm the same way. And I've said
                    that too. Those exact same words.
                    July 1972. Your mother and I were
                    fighting all the time. I guess she
                    was just plain tired of moving
                    home. Wasn't `til I retired after
                    42 years in the Air Force, I
                    realised we never had a home.

                    cold airbase outside Anchorage
                    Alaska. You must have been to

                    Speak out. Like that would suddenly
                    make this all go away. We can't
                    even speak to each other.

          There's a thousand things he could suddenly say. And suddenly
          nothing, as he fights tears.

          They kiss. As they break she looks into her husband's eyes.

                      that man's wife". I asked the first
                      question. Someone else asked the
                      second. It worked. Its still
                      working. Because we still don't

          Sa'ad arrives at the heavily fortified reactor. He is
          introduced to several men the last of which is Manucher Vaziri,
          the arms dealer Valerie was tracking.
          
                              VAZIRI
                    Welcome to the revolution my
                    brother.
          
          Sa'ad looks up at the state of the art facility.
          
                                                              CUT TO:
          
          EXT. CAPITOL HILL. DAY.
          
          VALERIE GETS OUT OF THE CAB. She walks down the street past
          the gleaming government buildings.

                    Whether its a pothole at the end of
                    your street or a lie in the State
                    of the Union Address..Speak up. Ask
                    the question. Demand the truth.
          
          Valerie walks. We see the Capitol dome behind her. She begins
          to climb steps..
          
                              JOE WILSON
                    Democracy is not a free ride...

          THE HALL.
          
                                JOE WILSON
                      Man I'm here to tell you that. But
                      its where we live. And if we do our
                      job its where our children will
                      live. God bless America.
          
          A roar erupts from the auditorium.
          
                                                            BACK TO:
          
          Valerie climbs the steps. Suddenly she is engulfed in
          flashes. Dozens of photographers. Reporters. She climbs the
          steps. She passes between the two enormous statues to the
          Spirit of Justice and The Majesty of the Law --
          
          INT. RAYBURN HOUSE. CAPITOL HILL. DAY.
          
          Valerie walks onto the floor of the Oversight Committee.
          Cameras. Microphones. Press photographers. She sits before a
          microphone. Swallows.
          
                                VALERIE
                      Good morning, Mr. Chairman and
                      members of the committee. My name
                      is Valerie Plame Wilson, and I am
                      honored to have been invited to
                      testify under oath before the
                      Committee on Oversight and
                      Government Reform on the critical
                      issue...
          
          The shot dissolves into the REAL VALERIE PLAME delivering her
          testimony to the chamber.
          
                                REAL VALERIE FOOTAGE
                      ...of safeguarding classified
                      information. I'm grateful for this
                      opportunity to set the record
                      straight. I served the United
                      States loyally and to the best of
                      my ability as a covert operations
                      officer for the Central
                      Intelligence Agency. I worked on
                      behalf of the national security of
                      our country, on behalf of the
                      people of the United States until
                      my name and true affiliation were
                      exposed in the national media on
                      July 14th, 2003, after a leak by
                      administration officials. Today I
                      can tell this committee even more.

                                 REAL VALERIE FOOTAGE (cont'd)
                       In the run-up to the war with Iraq
                       I worked in the Counter
                       Proliferation Division of the CIA,
                       still as a covert officer whose
                       affiliation with the CIA was
                       classified. I raced to discover
                       solid intelligence for senior
                       policy makers on Iraq 's presumed
                       weapons of mass destruction
                       program. While I helped to manage
                       and run secret worldwide operations
                       against this WMD target from CIA
                       headquarters in Washington , I also
                       traveled to foreign countries on
                       secret missions to find vital
                       intelligence. I loved my career
                       because I love my country.
          
          BLACKOUT
          
          On March 6th 2007 Scooter Libby was found guilty of perjury,
          obstruction of justice and making false statements to the
          FBI, concerning the leaking of Valerie Plame's identity.
          
          He was handed the maximum sentence: two and a half years in
          prison, and a $250,000 fine.
          
          On July 2nd 2007. The President used his executive authority
          to commute the court's sentence.
          
          Joe and Valerie left Washington and found a new home in Santa
          Fe. They live there today, with their children.
