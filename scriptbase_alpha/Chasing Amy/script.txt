     INT. COMIC BOOK STORE - DAY
     A pile of COMIC BOOKS are on a shelf next to myriad 
     others. The most prominent one is called BLUNTMAN AND 
     CHRONIC'.  A hand reaches in and pulls one out of frame.
     HOLDEN opens the comic and flips through it He shakes his 
     head.  BANKY looks over his shoulder.

                         BANKY
               Felt Like this fucking day would never 
               come.  Issue two - on the shelf.

                         HOLDEN
               Yippee.

                         BANKY
               Don't start, alright!  This is a cool 
               moment, and I'd appreciate you not 
               trying to ruin it.  How often does          
               a guy get the opportunity to purchase 
               something with his name on it!
                    (points to name on cover)
               Banky Edwards- right!
                    (points to the other)
               Holden McNeil.
                         HOLDEN
               I know my name.
                         BANKY
               C'mon, sour puss.  We got the rest of 
               our lives to be artists.  But it's 
               supply and demand.  And right now,          
               the unwashed masses demand this.
                         HOLDEN
                    (off comic)
               This is easy, alright!  And right now 
               it pays the bills.  Just don't forget 
               that we're better than this.
                         BANKY
               I'll tell you who we're better than: 
               these two fags right here.
     They approach the counter, where STEVE-DAVE, the store 
     manager, and WALT the Fan-boy, play a card game.
                         BANKY
                    (lays books on the counter)
               Alright Old-Maid's - take a break from 
               the Crazy-8's marathon and ring us up.
                         STEVE-DAVE
                    (not looking up)
               Well, well,well, Walt Did you see who 
               it is!  The local celebrities.  Quick - 
               get them to autograph one of their 
               books so we can sell it for triple 
               it's value.
                         WALT
               I'm not that in need of fifteen cents 
               right now.
     They snicker and high-five one another.  Holden rolls his 
     eyes.
                         BANKY
               You guys operate the smallest, ladies' 
               bridge circle I've ever seen.
                         WALT
               For your information, we're playing 
               Crimson Mystical Mages' - an 
               overpower card game. Not that either 
               of you would give a shit about 
               something as advanced     as this - 
               there are no dick or poopie jokes 
               involved.
                         BANKY
                    (to Holden)
               I don't think they're fans.
                         WALT
               No, we're not.  You're both a couple 
               of fucking no talents that got lucky.
                         STEVE-DAVE
               And obviously your handlers or hangers-
               on convinced you that your first comic 
               was good which it was not it was 
               thoroughly mediocre with a few spiky 
               bits of dialogue.  And when you get 
               your foot in the door of the business, 
               what do you do!  You turn out a piece 
               of shit like Bluntman and Chronic'.
                         WALT
               Tell him, Steve-Dave.
                         STEVE-DAVE
                    (off comic)
               Bluntman and Chronic'.  Pah.  
               What was that thing the little stoner 
               pulled on the villain in the last 
               issue!
                         WALT
               The Stinky-palm.
                         STEVE-DAVE
               Stinky-palm.  You give comics a bad 
               name I tell all my customers not to 
               buy it, to spend their money on a real 
               comic book.
                         WALT
               Fucking one hit wonder, dime-store 
               Frank Miller's.
                         STEVE-DAVE
               This is the reality at Comic-Toast - 
               you're not going to get your ass 
               kissed here, because both me and Walt 
               think you suck.
                         WALT
               And me.
                         STEVE-DAVE
               I said that.
     Steve-Dave offers the boys his two middle fingers, then 
     goes back to playing his game with Walt.  Holden and 
     Banky stare, shocked.  Banky nudges Holden and they both 
     exit Steve-Dave and the Fan-boy slap hands and go back to 
     playing.
                         WALT
               I've got a dragon card - forty power-
               ups and twelve life points!  Ha!  I 
               get your elf card!
                         STEVE-DAVE
               You're such a bitch!  But thankfully, 
               I've saved a dark forces Shaman card 
               for just such an occasion.
                         WALT
               You suck!  Eighty six life-power 
               points to my twenty two!
                         STEVE-DAVE
               I schooled their asses, now I'm 
               schooling your's.
     Suddenly.  A trash can crashes through the front window. 
     Steve-Dave and Walt hit the deck like bitches, covering 
     one another.  They look up slowly. Steve-Dave leaps to 
     his feet and looks at the shattered mess.  He pulls 
     something off the garbage can and reads it.
                         WALT
               You know it was those two fucks!  
               Let's call the cops and have them 
               busted!  I know where their studio is!  
               Or better yet, let's sue!  You can sue 
               them, Steve-Dave!
                         STEVE-DAVE
                    (still reading note)
               That won't be necessary.
                         WALT
               What?!  Why the hell not!
                         STEVE-DAVE
                    (holds up check)
               Because this is a check for three 
               times what that window cost.
                    (reading note)
               Dear critics - thanks for the 
               insight. But like my grandmother 
               always said - Fuck 'em if they can't 
               take a joke.. and break their window.'  
               Kiss it,          Banky the Hack. 
               P.S. - Your card game blows.
                         WALT
               He said Kiss it!

     INT. COMIC BOOK: CONVENTION SIGNING BOOTH - DAY
     A physically large FAN - sweaty brow, tote bag bursting 
     with comics - leans forward, smiling.
                         FAN
               Could you sign it To a really big 
               fan!
     Holden sits at a table.  Across from the barely-managing-
     to-stand Fan.  He offers him a patronizingly kind, half-
     smile in return,
                         HOLDEN
               You bet.
     We're at a Comic Book show, specifically at a book-
     signing. Behind Holden hangs a large banner, heralding 
     HOLDEN McNEIL AND BANKY EDWARDS -
     CREATORS OF BLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC'. Beside it is a large 
     mock-up of the comic book cover which features two stoner 
     super-heroes who bear a
     striking resemblance to a pair of very familiar friendly 
     neighborhood drug
     dealers, Holden hands the book back to the Fan.
                         FAN
               I love this book man!  This shit's 
               awesome.  I wish I was like these guys 
               - getting stoned, talking all raw 
               about          chicks and fighting 
               supervillains!  I love these guys!  
               They're like Cheech and Chong' meet 
               Bill and fed'!
                         HOLDEN
               I like to chink of them as 
               Rosencrantz and Guildenstern' meet 
               Vladimir and Estragon'.
                         FAN
               Yeah!
                    (beat)
               Who!
     BANKY signs the book of another COLLECTOR.
                         COLLECTOR
               So you draw this!
                         BANKY
                    (signing the comic)
               I ink it and I'm also the colorist.  
               The guy next to me draws it.  But we 
               both came up with the characters,
                         COLLECTOR
               What's that mean - you ink it'!
                         BANKY
               Well.  It means that Holden draws the 
               pictures in pencil, and then he gives 
               it to me to go over in ink
                         COLLECTOR
               So you just trace!
     Banky freezes up.  He composes himself and continues 
     signing.
                         BANKY
               It's not tracing.  I add depth and 
               shading to give the image mere 
               definition. Only then does the drawing     
               really take shape.
                         COLLECTOR
               You go over what he draws with a pen - 
               that's tracing.
                         BANKY
                    (hands book back to 
                    Collector)
               Not really.
                    (calling out)
               Next!
     A LITTLE KID steps up but the Collector lingers.
                         COLLECTOR
               Hey man.  If somebody draws something 
               and then you draw the same thing right 
               on top of it, not going out-side the 
               designated original art what do call 
               that!
                         LITTLE KID
                    (shrugs)
               I don't know.  Tracing?
                         COLLECTOR
                    (to Banky)
               See?
                         BANKY
               It's not tracing.
                         COLLECTOR
               Oh, but it is.
                         BANKY
                    (to Little Kid)
               Do you want Lour book signed or what?
                         COLLECTOR
               Hey - don't get all testy with him 
               just because you have a problem with 
               your station in life.
                         BANKY
               I'm secure with what I do.
                         COLLECTOR
               Then say it - you're a tracer.
                         BANKY
                    (grabbing Little Kid's book)
               How should I sign this?
                         LITTLE KID
                    (grabs book back)
               I don't want you to sign it, I want 
               the guy that draws Bluntman and 
               Chronic to sign it.  You're just a 
               tracer.
                         COLLECTOR
               Tell him, Little Shaver.
     Holden accepts a comic from another Fan.
                         HOLDEN
                    (off comic)
               Who do I sign it to!
     Before Holden can finish, a loud crash is heard.  He 
     looks to his left and freaks.
     Banky is throttling the Collector from across the table. 
     The Collector attempts to fight him off.  SECURITY GUARDS 
     pull them apart. Holden grabs Banky.
                         COLLECTOR
               Jesus!  All I did was call him a 
               tracer!
                         BANKY
                    (to Collector)
               I'LL TRACE A CHALK LINE AROUND YOUR 
               DEAD FUCKING BODY, YOU FUCK?!
                         HOLDEN
                    (to Security Guard)
               Could you get him out of here!
     The Security Guards drag the collector away.
                         COLLECTOR
               Hey, wait a sec!  He jumped me!  And 
               you're dragging me away!!
                    (exiting)
               Fucking tracer!
                         BANKY
                    (calling OC)
               YOUR MOTHER'S A TRACER!!
 
                         HOLDEN
               Can I explain the audience principle 
               to you!  If you insult and accost 
               them, then we have no audience.
                         BANKY
               He started it!  Fucking cock-knocker! 
               He's lucky I didn't put my pen through 
               his thorax!
                         HOLDEN
               Need I remind you...
                    (holds up watch)
               Curtain's in ten minutes.
     INT. COMIC BOOK CONVENTION LECTURE HALL - DAY
     HOOPER fills the frame.  He comes off like a typical, pro-
     black/anti-white homeboy.
                         HOOPER
               For years in this industry whenever an 
               African-American character - hero or 
               villain - was introduced usually by 
               white artists and writers - they got 
               slapped with racist names that singled 
               them out as negroes: Black Panther, 
               Black Lightning, Black Goliath, Black     
               Mantra, Black Talon, Black Spider, 
               Black Hand, Black Falcon, Black Cat..
                         VOICE FROM CROWD
               She's white.
                         HOOPER
               She is?
                    (beat)
               Well bust this - regardless.
     We're at a panel discussion.  The room is full.  Five 
     creators sit at a long table, their names on placards in 
     front of them.  
     (One of them is a very striking Girl.)  The banner behind 
     them reads WORDS UP - MINORITY VOICES IN COMICS'.
                         HOOPER
                    (holds up comic)
               Now my book, White-Hating Coon', 
               doesn't have any of that bullshit. The 
               hero's name is Maleekwa, and he's a     
               descendant of the black tribe that 
               established the first society on the 
               planet, while all you European mother     
               fuckers were still hiding in caves and 
               shit, all terrified of the sun. He's a 
               strong role model that a young black

               and we're gonna get respect -

     During the speech, Holden and Banky enter and sit up 
     front.

     Hooper whips his head around, looking for the source of

               I did!  Lando Calrissian is a positive

               those movies are about how the white 
               man keeps the brother man down - even 
               in a galaxy far, far away.  Check

               Luke Skywalker, Nazi poster boy - 
               blond hair, blue eyes.  
               And then you've got          Darth 
               Vader: the blackest brother in the

               all that shit.  Then this cracker 
               Skywalker gets his hands on a light-
               saber, and the boy decides he's          
               gonna run the fucking universe - gets 
               a whole Klan of whites together, and 
               they're gonna bust up Vader's hood

               But Vader turns, out to be Luke's 
               father.  And in Jedi, they become

               Don't make me bust a cap in your ass, 
               yo!  Jedi's the most insulting

               beautiful,          black visage is 
               sullied when he pulls off his mask to 
               reveal a feeble, crusty white man! 
               They're trying to tell us that deep 
               inside, we all want to be white!
                         BANKY
               Well isn't that true!
     Hooper explodes, He pulls a nine millimeter from his 
     belt, draws on Banky and fires.  Banky goes down, falling 
     forward into the crowd The crowd screams and starts to 
     scatter, Hooper jumps over the table and raises his fists 
     in the air.
                         HOOPER

     The crowd-is gone.  Holden sits in his chair, laughing. 
     Hooper steps off the stage and picks Banky's head up off 
     the floor.

     Hooper sounds different Actually, he sounds gay.  
     Actually - he is.  Banky smiles.
                         BANKY
               Well what about you!  You didn't tell 
               me you were going to scream Black

                         HOLDEN
               How do you manage to get away with 
               this all the time?  Shouldn't cops be

     A beautiful, blonde, ruffled-haired angel swinging her 
     purse in a circle. Her name is ALYSSA.  She's the

               Holden.  Banky - this pile of P.M.S. 
               is Alyssa Jones.  She does that book 
               Idiosyncratic Routine'.  This is the 
               fourth panel we've been on together, 
               and even though she knows my publisher 
               sets this up and pays for the event. 
               She still gets mad when it ends with 
               my act.
                         ALYSSA
               I just wish I was the one who gets to

               panel with the likes of us.  They 
               slumming right now.

               I told Alyssa I'd buy her a post-rave 
               drink.  Do the Garden-Staters have to 
               sprint to the Lincoln Tunnel, or can 
               you stay for a round in the big, scary

               We'll go.
     Banky offers Holden a puzzled glance.  Then he nods to 
     Hooper.
                         BANKY
               We'll go.
     INT BAR - NIGHT
     Holden, Banky, Alyssa and Hooper sir around a table 
     drinking, talking, and smoking.
                         BANKY
               Archie, alright!  Archie and the 
               Riverdale gang were a pure and fun-
               lovin' bunch.  You can't find 
               dysfunction in those comics, because 
               they were just flat out wholesome.
                         HOOPER
               Archie and Jughead were lovers.

               Shut the fuck up.
                         HOOPER
               It's true.  Archie was the bitch and 
               Jughead was the butch - that's why 
               Jughead wears that crown-looking hat 
               all the time: he the king, of queen 
               Archie's world.

               Man, I feel a hate-crime coming on
                         HOLDEN
               He's got a point.  Archie never did 
               settle on Betty or Veronica.
                         BANKY
               Because he wanted them both at the 
               same time, you assholes!  He never 
               chose one because he was trying to get 
               both of them into a three-way!

               I told you to watch it with that Urkel 
               shit.  Face it, girl - Archie's a 
               sister.
                         BANKY
                    (getting up; to Hooper)
               That's it.  You.

               You are marching back across the 
               street with me, and we're going to 
               pick up a shit load of Archie books, I 
               am going to prove to you - beyond the 
               shadow of a doubt that Archie was all 
               about pussy.  Come on.
                         HOOPER
                    (sliding out of booth)
               This boy is conflicted, I shall play 
               mother-therapist for him.  You two sit 
               tight.  We shall return promptly.
     Banky and Hooper exit, leaving Alyssa and Holden alone at 
     the table.
                         ALYSSA

                         HOLDEN
               For years now.  Started back in third 
               grade - a nun was teaching us about 
               the Blessed Trinity.  She's going on 
               about the three persons in one God 
               thing - Father, Son, Holy Spirit - and 
               he just goes ballistic.  I guess it 
               was too big for him to grasp.  They 
               got into this huge fight.
                         ALYSSA
               Please.  How bad could it have been!
                         HOLDEN
               You ever seen a nun call a small child 
               a fucking cunt-rag'?  Wasn't pretty, 
               Shit like that's bound to happen when 
               you make a kid wear a matching tie and 
               slacks everyday.
                         ALYSSA
               And your parochial school

               Limited to wine-tasting prior to mass. 
               Turned me into a grade school 
               alcoholic altar boy.  I couldn't tell 
               you how many mornings after serous 
               benders          I'd wake up next 
               to strange priests.
                         ALYSSA
               Aren't you the sharp wit!
                         HOLDEN
               Sharp!  No.  I'm just a fan of clergy-
               molestation humor.  Probably why the 
               extended family quit inviting me to 
               First Communion parties.
     Alyssa laughs.  Holden smiles.
                         ALYSSA

     AT THE DART BOARD

     A dart hits the board then, one hits the wall beside the 
     board.

     Alyssa winds up with another dart.  Holden watches. Her's 
     always hit. His never do.

                         ALYSSA
               So your new book seems to be selling 
               like mad.

                         HOLDEN
               It goes back to something my 
               grandmother told me when I was a kid. 
               "Holden," she said "The big bucks are 
               in dick and fart jokes."  She was a 
               church-goer.

                         ALYSSA
               Uh-oh - the cry from the heart of a 
               real artist trapped in commercial hell 
               - pitying his good fortune.  I'm sure 
               you can dry your eyes on all those fat 
               checks you rake in.

                         HOLDEN
               I'm sorry - did I detect a note of 
               bitter envy in there!

                         ALYSSA
               Nope.  I'm happy my stuff gets read at 
               all.  There's very little market for 
               hearts and flowers in this spandex-
               clad, big pecs, big tits, big guns 
               field.  If I sell two issues, I feel 
               like John Grisham.

                         HOLDEN
                    (looking out window)
               It's all about marketing.  Over- or 
               underweight guys who don't get laid - 
               they're our bread and butter.  People 
               like those two outside should be 
               yours.

     Through the window, we see a COUPLE making out on the 
     hood of a car.

                         HOLDEN
               And sadly, there are more of our core 
               audience out there than yours.
                    (smiles)
               Look at that, though - kind of gives 
               you a little charge, to see two people 
               in love.  And all over Banky's car, no 
               less.  That car's seeing more action 
               right now than it's seen in years.

                         ALYSSA
               Bubbly guy like that, it's hard to 
               figure out why.

                         HOLDEN
                    (still looking at OC Couple)
               You've gotta respect that kind of 
               display of affection.  It's crazy, 
               rude, self-absorbed - but it's love.

                         ALYSSA
               That's not love.

                         HOLDEN
               Says you.

                         ALYSSA
               That out there!  That's fleeting.

                         HOLDEN
               Fleeting.

                         ALYSSA
               Uh-huh.  You wanna hear about love!  
               Oh, I'll tell you about love.

                         HOLDEN
               A story?

                         ALYSSA
               The story.  The original love story.

                         HOLDEN
               'Doctor Zhivago'.

                         ALYSSA
               Nope.  My mother's uncle.  He was a 
               millionaire.

                         HOLDEN
               Get out.

                         ALYSSA
               I kid you not.

                         HOLDEN
               Explain.

                         ALYSSA
               All through high school, he dated this 
               one girl.  They  were inseparable.  
               And when they graduated, she went off 
               to Carnegie Mellon...

                         HOLDEN
               In Pittsburgh.

                         ALYSSA
               I'm impressed.  So he stays in the 
               home town, and they begin their long-
               distance relationship.  The plan is, 
               on the  third Sunday of every month, 
               he'll train out, spend a week then 
               train back They do this for four 
               years.

                         HOLDEN
               That is love.

                         ALYSSA
               Not nearly finished.  Two months 
               before she's going to graduate, he's 
               got this job digging graves, and he 
               comes across...

                         HOLDEN
               A stiff.

                         ALYSSA
               A steamer trunk containing silver 
               ingots.

                         HOLDEN
               Get out of here.

                         ALYSSA
               Many, many silver ingots.  Now, my 
               mother's uncle being quite the 
               ingenious chap - he buries the trunk  
               again and heads up to the main office, 
               where he proceeds to purchase a 
               cemetery plot.  Guess which one?

                         HOLDEN
               Clever.

                         ALYSSA
               So now he owns the plot and all of its 
               contents.  Two  days later, my 
               mother's uncle is worth three million.

                         HOLDEN
               At which time he marries the high 
               school sweetheart and lives happily 
               ever after.

                         ALYSSA
               Not even close.  Inside the steamer 
               trunk, stenciled into the wood, or 
               something like that, is a curse.

                         HOLDEN
               Someone wrote 'Fuck' inside his new 
               steamer trunk.

                         ALYSSA
               Not that kind of curse.  A cryptic 
               curse "Great fortune means great loss" 
               it said.

                         HOLDEN
               What kind of asshole writes that 
               inside a steamer trunk!

                         ALYSSA
               The same kind of asshole that buries 
               silver ingots.  The day my mother's 
               uncle is heading out to see the girl, 
               he stops at his accountant's to grab 
               some cash, and winds up missing his 
               train.  So he has to take the next one 
               - which he does - and he gets there an 
               hour later than his usual time of 
               arrival, whereupon he sees lights.

                         HOLDEN
               A hero's welcome for the new 
               millionaire.

                         ALYSSA
               It seems that while she was standing 
               on the platform waiting that extra 
               hour for my mother's uncle to show up, 
               the girl was dragged into the bushes 
               by an unknown assailant, raped and 
               gutted.

     Holden is silent Alyssa downs her drink.

                         ALYSSA
               The assailant was never apprehended.

                         HOLDEN
                    (beat)
               That's a love story!!

                         ALYSSA
               Yes, and here's why: my mother's uncle 
               rode that train every day for the rest 
               of his life.  One day up, the next day 
               back.  Did that 'till the day he died.  
               He donated the fortune he'd acquired 
               to the train station in Pittsburgh, to 
               have a well-lit terminal built.  
               The train line let him ride for free 
               after that.

                         HOLDEN
               I should hope so.  Jesus, that's the 
               saddest tale I've ever heard.

                         ALYSSA
               That's my love story.

     Alyssa tosses her last dart.  Holden seems a bit dazed.  
     He looks out the window.

                         HOLDEN
               Those two aren't on the hood of 
               Banky's car anymore.

                         ALYSSA
               I told you It wasn't love.
                    (grabs her purse)
               I gotta split.  It was really nice 
               meeting you.  I wish you the best of 
               luck with your book.
                    (shakes his hand)
               Tell Hooper I'll call him later.  And 
               tell your friend to calm down.

     Alyssa exits to the night.  Holden stares after her.  Two 
     beats later, Hooper and Banky enter, holding an 
     'Everything's Archie' comic between them.

                         BANKY
               You're insane.  Archie is not fucking 
               Mister Weatherbee!

                         HOOPER
               Deny, deny, deny.
                    (to Holden)
               Where's Alyssa?

                         HOLDEN
               Huh!  Oh.  She left.  She said she'd 
               call you later.

                         BANKY
                    (off comic)
               He's just offering to help Archie with 
               his homework!

                         HOOPER
               Read between the lines.

                         BANKY
                    (shoves book at him)
               Fuck this.
                    (to Holden)
               Let's go.  Traffic.
                    (no response from Holden)
               Holden!

                         HOLDEN
                    (shaken)
               What!

                         BANKY
               Let's go.

                         HOOPER
                    (looking out window)
               D'jou see that dent in the hood of 
               your car!

                         BANKY
                    (looking out window)
               What the...!  Son of a bitch!

     Banky runs out Holden shrugs at Hooper.

                         HOOPER
               Let me guess: you like her!

                         HOLDEN
               Who?

                         HOOPER
               Miss Alyssa Jones.

                         HOLDEN
               She's alright.

                         HOOPER
               As long as that's all.
                    (finishes drink)
               Maybe you can convince that partner of 
               your's to drop me off downtown before 
               you scurry out the tunnel!

                         HOLDEN
                    (beat)
               Mister Weatherbee wasn't really trying 
               to fuck Archie, was he!

     They begin exiting.

                         HOOPER
               Hell no.  Weatherbee was Reggie's 
               bitch.



     INT. STUDIO - DAY

     We're in Holden and Banky's studio/apartment.  It's a 
     rented loft-style place with high ceilings, wood floors 
     and sparse furnishings.  There are posters on the walls, 
     a sort of kitchenette, a hockey net, a big TV. (with all 
     the trimmings - VCR, Laserdisc player, Sega, SNES), a 
     huge comfy couch, and two drawing boards with adjacent 
     desks (littered with pencils, pens, coloring pencils, 
     paints, erasers, etc.) - at which sit Holden and Banky.  
     They're working.  Some music plays.

     C.U. OF HOLDEN PENCILING - over his shoulder, we see 
     Holden sketching Chronic in mid-attack of his arch-
     nemesis - the Giggler.  Holden erases a line and re-
     draws.

     C.U. OF BANKY INKING - over his shoulder, we see Banky 
     outlining a pre-penciled page.  He traces Bluntman 
     swinging from a street light.

     The two work in silence.  Then...

                         BANKY
                    (not looking up)
               This is one of the best street lights 
               you've ever drawn.

                         HOLDEN
               It's the one across from the post 
               office.

                         BANKY
               Looks just like it.

                         HOLDEN
               Thanks.
                    (beat)
               What do you wanna do tonight!

                         BANKY
               Get a pizza.  Watch 'Degrassi Junior 
               High'.

                         HOLDEN
                    (erases)
               You got a weird thing for Canadian 
               melodrama.

                         BANKY
               I've got a weird thing for girls who 
               say 'aboot'.

     The phone starts ringing.  Holden answers it, while still 
     drawing.

                         HOLDEN
               Bank-Hold-Up.

     CROSSCUT between Holden and Hooper.  He's on a phone in a 
     CLUB.

                         HOOPER
               Hooper here.  Listen, I know how you 
               burb-fiends hate the city, but there's 
               a club shindig going down that I think 
               you'd get into.

                         HOLDEN
               Where is it?

                         HOOPER
               Place called Her-sterectomy - I'm 
               tempting as bar-keep.

                         HOLDEN
               I don't know, Hoop.  We're prepping 
               the next issue, and we've got our big 
               M-TV meeting in the morning.

                         HOOPER
               I told her you wouldn't be interested.

                         HOLDEN
               Told who?

                         HOOPER
               Alyssa.

                         HOLDEN
               Alyssa from last night Alyssa?

                         HOOPER
               How do you begin and end a question 
               with the same word like that?  You got 
               skill.  Yes, that one.  She asked me 
               to invite you.  Now here's the part 
               where you say...

                         HOLDEN
               I'll be there.

                         HOOPER
               Thought so.  Ten o'clock.  Later.
                    (both hang up)

                         BANKY
               Who was that?

                         HOLDEN
               Hooper.  He invited me to a club.

                         BANKY
               When's that faggot going to learn - 
               you like chicks.

                         HOLDEN
                    (getting up)
               Not that kind of a club.

                         BANKY
               So when we leaving?

                         HOLDEN
               'We'?  You can't go.  He's setting me 
               up with Alyssa.

                         BANKY
               And?

                         HOLDEN
               And I don't want you messing it up.

                         BANKY
               Like I care about your shit.  Maybe 
               I'll hook up myself.

                         HOLDEN
                    (pulling on coat)
               I just told you - it's not that kind 
               of club.

                         BANKY
               How does one man get to be so funny!

                         HOLDEN
                    (throws him his coat)
               How are you going to get home if I 
               hook up!

                         BANKY
               Like that'll happen.

                         HOLDEN
               Let me explain something to you, my 
               witless chum the other night in that 
               bar, we two - Alyssa and I shared a 
               moment, alright!

                         BANKY
               Oh, you had a moment!

                         HOLDEN
                    (brings his two pointer 
                    fingers together)
               We shared a moment.  And in that 
               moment, one thing was made abundantly 
               clear: this girl loves me, my friend.   
               Loves-me.



6.     INT. HER-STERECTOMY - NIGHT                              6.

     It's a club - people are mingling, a band is playing, 
     it's loud.  But something's fishy.  Hooper's tending bar.  
     He hands a GUY a drink.  The Guy sips it.

                         GUY
               This is so watered down.  It's 
               terrible.  Why is it you can never get 
               a decent drink in these places!

     Hooper looks around in a very exaggerated fashion.

                         GUY
               What are you doing!

                         HOOPER
               Trying to find you a tissue.

     The Guy shoots Hooper an angry glare, Banky enters.

                         BANKY
               Alright - bring on the free hootch.

                         HOOPER
               As long as you don't bitch about how 
               little alcohol is in the drink.
                    (hands Banky a drink; to Guy)
               You owe me five sixty.

                         GUY
                    (off Banky)
               And I suppose you're going to make 
               your friend here pay for his drink 
               right!

                         BANKY
               Hey, I befriended a guy in a position 
               of authority so I could abuse that 
               authority and get free shit.  You want 
               to do the same?  There's a lonely 
               Hindu works at the'7-ll' across the 
               street.  Get in tight with him.

     The Guy angrily pulls out his money and slams it on the 
     bar.

                         GUY
               I work at that '7-11'!
                    (storms away)

                         BANKY
                    (calling after him)
               Wanna be friends!

                         HOOPER
               Where's your better half!

                         BANKY
               Taking a piss.  Guy's got a bladder 
               like an infant.

                         HOOPER
               That's funny - he says you're hung 
               like an infant.

                         BANKY
               Must his mother tell him everything!

     Holden enters.

                         BANKY
               What'd you do - fall in love?

                         HOLDEN
               Where is she?

                         HOOPER
               Over there...

     ON THE DANCE FLOOR - in the middle of a thrall of people - 
     dances Alyssa.  She moves like a cat and she's looking 
     very sexy.

                         OC HOOPER
               Been dancin' for an hour.  Hasn't 
               stopped yet.

     Hooper, Holden, and Banky stare OC.

                         BANKY
               She ain't no Denny Terrio, I'll say 
               that.

     Holden smacks Banky and moves to exit.

                         HOOPER
               Wait. wait, wait - there's something 
               you should know.

                         HOLDEN
               She's got a boyfriend.

                         HOOPER
               Well.. no.

                         HOLDEN
               Then what's to know?

     Holden exits; They watch him go.  Banky looks around.

                         BANKY
               There're a lot of chicks in this 
               place.

                         HOOPER
               'Chicks'.  You're such a man.

                         BANKY
                    (beat)
               He didn't really say that about my 
               dick, did he!

     ON THE DANCE FLOOR - Holden slips into the crowd and 
     dances up to Alyssa.  He intentionally bumps into her.

                         HOLDEN
                    (fake rage, dancing)
               Hey, hey, hey - you fucked up my 
               cabbage-patch!

                         ALYSSA
               Well, well, well - Bluntman himself.  
               Or should I call you Chronic!

                         HOLDEN
               Call me flattered.  I heard you sent 
               me the invite to this little soiree'.

                         ALYSSA
               From a former home-town girl, to 
               Mister Home-Town himself.

                         HOLDEN
               You're saying you're from the 'burbs!

                         ALYSSA
               Middletown, N.J.

                         HOLDEN
               Get out of here!  I'm from Highlands!

                         ALYSSA
               I know.  Hooper told me.

                         HOLDEN
               How is it that we never ran into one 
               another?

                         ALYSSA
               You graduate from Hudson?

                         HOLDEN
               Yeah.  Eighty eight.

                         ALYSSA
               I went to North.  Also eighty eight.

                         HOLDEN
               What a small fucking world.  So you 
               know the tri-town area!

                         ALYSSA
               Quiz me.

                         HOLDEN
               Miller Hill?

                         ALYSSA
               I wrote my name on the wall.

                         HOLDEN
               Sandy Hook?

                         ALYSSA
               Lost my virginity there.

                         HOLDEN
               This is so cool.  The mall!

                         ALYSSA
               Eden Prairie of Menlo Park!

                         HOLDEN
               Wait - here's the big test: Quick 
               Stop!

                         ALYSSA
               My best friend fucked a dead guy in 
               the back room.

                         HOLDEN
               You know that girl!!

                         ALYSSA
               I did.  Before she was committed.

                         HOLDEN
               You know what this is!  This is fate.

                         ALYSSA
                    (regarding her move)
               No, this is the 'Rog'.

                         HOLDEN
               I was talking about us meeting - what 
               are the chances!

                         ALYSSA
               Pretty slim.  I haven't been back to 
               the 'burbs since my friend's funeral.

                         HOLDEN
               The Quick Stop girl died!

                         ALYSSA
               Another friend - Julie Dwyer.  She 
               died in the..

                         HOLDEN
               Y.M.C.A pool!  Damn!  You knew her 
               too!

                         ALYSSA
               So well.

                         HOLDEN
               One friend in an asylum, the other 
               friend in the grave.  You're a 
               dangerous person to know.

                         ALYSSA
               But I can tap.
                    (does an impromptu tap dance)
               That was the Buffalo Two-Step.

                         HOLDEN
               Very solid.

                         ALYSSA
               That's what six years of tap lessons 
               yields.

                         HOLDEN
               Two towns away from each other for 
               years and we had to meet in New York.

     The Sand stops playing. People clap.

                         ALYSSA
               Coulda been worse - we could have not 
               met at all.

     Holden looks at her.

                         OC SINGER
               Thank you.  Thanks.

     The SINGER on stage speaks into the microphone.

                         SINGER
               A long time ago, we used to have this 
               bass player who took off one day to 
               draw funny books or something.  Maybe 
               you've seen her stuff - it's called 
               'Idiosyncratic Routine''

     The crowd applauds.  Alyssa shakes her head, smiling. 
     Holden pokes her.

                         SINGER
               But what a lot of people don't know is 
               that she used to harbor these 
               delusions that she could sing.  And 
               she used to subject us to these 
               throaty renditions of Debbie Gibson 
               tunes and shit, insisting that we let 
               her front on a few numbers.  Well, we 
               didn't and she quit.. and then she got 
               famous, the bitch.
                    (crowd laughs)
               But she's here tonight, and I think if 
               we all begged, or maybe offered her 
               some X, she'd get up here and treat us 
               to some of her vocal stylings.
                    (crowd applauds)
               What do you say, Alyssa?

     Alyssa shakes her head no.  The crowd urges her.  Holden 
     pushes her forward.

                         SINGER
               She's shy.
                    (yelling)
               GET UP HERE AND SING, BITCH!!

     The crowd thunders.  Alyssa offers the Singer an 
     embarrassed half-smile.  She looks at Holden, who claps 
     along with the others and nods toward the stage.  Alyssa 
     shakes her head and relents, heading through the crowd

     Banky and Hooper stand at the bar.

                         BANKY
               This is so queer.
                    (he exits)

                         HOOPER
                    (beat)
               You don't know the half of it.

     Alyssa jumps on stage, hugging the Singer.  She takes the 
     mic, shaking her head.  The crowd is applauding.

                         ALYSSA
               She is such a twat.

     The crowd cheers.  Alyssa laughs.  She turns to the band 
     and says something which they nod.  She turns back to the 
     crowd.

                         ALYSSA
               Alright.  I should dedicate this, 
               right?
                    (thinks)
               This is for that special someone our 
               there.

     Holden smiles.  Banky joins him.  Holden glances at him.  
     Banky offers a mocking mimic of his smile.

     The band starts playing.  Cross cutting begins.

     Alyssa launches into a torchy tune.  The song is 
     extremely sexy - as is Alyssa who works the mic, making 
     direct eye contact with...

     Holden.  Or does she!  Holden is smiling, being seduced,  
     Banky rolls his eyes.  Beside Holden, stands a pretty 
     GIRL with a short haircut, who's also riveted by Alyssa's 
     performance.

     Alyssa makes big-time eye contact with somebody out 
     there.  
     The song seems to be aimed at whoever she's looking at.  
     It's more than obvious there's a seduction going on, bur 
     of whom!  At the end of the song, the crowd goes wild but 
     Alyssa's preoccupied.  She points to someone in the 
     crowd, and curls her finger back in a 'c'mere' fashion, 
     urging whoever it is to join her.  She jumps off the 
     stage.

     Holden shakes his head sheepishly and looks downward, aw-
     shucks style.  At that moment, the Girl beside him leaps 
     forward.  Banky's eyes widen.  Holden looks up and is 
     suddenly taken aback.

     Alyssa and the Girl race into each other's arms and fall 
     into a way-to-passionate-to-mean-anything-else kiss.

     Holden's eyes bug.  Banky allows a smile to creep across 
     his face.  The crowd applauds.  Banky looks around, and 
     for the first time, we get the distinct impression that 
     this is a lesbian bar...

     There are a lot of chicks in this place.  Gay chicks.  
     Banky looks at Holden and slaps him on the back.

                         BANKY
               Now that, my friend, is a..
                    (brings his fingers together, 
                    mimicing Holden)
               ...shared moment

     Holden continues to stare - mouth agape.

     Alyssa and the Girl continue to kiss.



     INT. HER-STERECTOMY - LATER

     Banky, Holden, Alyssa and the Girl from the dance floor 
     sit around a table.  Alyssa and the Girl continue to make 
     out.  Holden and Banky casually watch, wide-eyed.  Banky 
     stares a little harder.  Holden hits him.

                         BANKY
               What?!

                         HOLDEN
                    (under his breath)
               That's rude.

                         BANKY
               Man, when are we ever going to get a 
               chance to see this kind of shit live 
               without paying for it?

     Alyssa and the Girl break their kiss.

                         ALYSSA
               Uh-oh - better knock it off: we're 
               getting a man excited.

                         HOLDEN
               Sorry.  It's just... new to him.

                         BANKY
               Oh, and you're an old hand at this.

                         ALYSSA
               No, I should apologize.  I don't 
               usually get all mushy in public.  But 
               it's been awhile since I've seen Kim 
               here.

                         KIM
                    (formerly the Girl)
               Tell me you didn't set that gross 
               display up with the band just so you 
               could nail me.

                         ALYSSA
               Like I'd have to go through that much 
               effort

                         KIM
               You know what!  I want to dance.

                         ALYSSA
               Go ahead.  I'll watch from here.

                         KIM
                    (tugging at her arm)
               No.  I want to dance with you.

                         ALYSSA
               Don't be such a rag.  I have to sit 
               here and work up the desire to fuck 
               you later.

                         KIM
               Please.

     Kim exits.  Banky is smiling ear-to-ear.  Alyssa looks at 
     him.

                         ALYSSA
               Yes?

                         BANKY
               You said 'fuck'.  To that girl.  You 
               said you'd 'fuck' her.

                         ALYSSA
               And?

                         BANKY
               How can a girl 'fuck' another girl! 
               Were you talking about strap-ons or 
               something?

                         HOLDEN
                    (hits him)
               Would you shut up!!

                         BANKY
               What!!?  It's a valid question.  You 
               know the dyke stuff in the Penthouse 
               Letters section is written by guys - 
               this is our chance to get the inside 
               scoop.

                         HOLDEN
                    (to Alyssa)
               I don't know how many times I can 
               apologize for him.

                         ALYSSA
               It's okay.  Secretly, all I really 
               want is to be the center of attention.
                    (to Banky)
               I've never used a snap-on.

                         BANKY
               Then what's with saying 'fuck?  
               Shouldn't you say 'eat her out' or at 
               least modify the term 'fuck' with 
               something like 'fist'?

                         ALYSSA
               Let me ask you a question - can men 
               'fuck' each other!

                         BANKY
               Ask Hooper.

                         ALYSSA
               In your estimation.

                         BANKY
               Sure.

                         ALYSSA
               So for you, to 'fuck' means to 
               penetrate.  You're used to the more 
               traditional definition - you inside 
               some girl you've duped, jack-hammering 
               away, not noticing that bored look in 
               her eyes.

                         BANKY
               Hey - I always notice the bored look 
               in their eyes.

                         ALYSSA
                    (laughs)
               'Fucking' is nor limited to 
               penetration, Banky. For me it 
               describes any sex when it's not 
               totally about love.  I don't love Kim, 
               but I'll fuck her.  I'm sure you don't 
               love every girl you sleep with.

                         BANKY
               Some of them I downright loathe.

                         ALYSSA
               But I'll bet it's different with the 
               ones you love.  I'll bet you go the 
               full nine when it's not just a quick 
               fix - like you go down on them longer 
               or something.

                         HOLDEN
               Here we go.

                         BANKY
               I don't do that.

                         ALYSSA
               What?!?!

                         BANKY
               I stopped dropping.  It got to be too 
               frustrating.

                         HOLDEN
               As stupid as you usually come off 
               during this diatribe of your's, you're 
               going to come off ten times as stupid 
               on this occasion.

                         BANKY
               What?!  I lost my tolerance for the 
               bullshit baggage that comes with 
               eating girls out.  What's the big 
               deal?!

                         ALYSSA
               If you say the smell, so help me, I'll 
               slug you.

                         BANKY
               Not the smell - the smell is good.  
               I'm talking about not being able to do 
               it property.  And my mother brought me 
               up to believe that if I can't do 
               something
               right I shouldn't do it at all.  Of 
               course, my father told me she gave 
               lousy head, but that's beside the 
               point.

                         ALYSSA
               At least you blame yourself for your 
               sexual inadequacies.

                         BANKY
               No, I blame them.  Chicks never help 
               you out.  They never tell you what to 
               do.  And most of them are self-
               conscious about that smell factor, and 
               so most of the time they just lay 
               there, frozen like a deer in the 
               headlights, right?  Not for nothing, 
               but when a chick goes down on me.  I 
               let her know where to go, and what the 
               status is.  You gotta handle it like 
               CNN and the Weather Channel - constant 
               updates.

                         HOLDEN
               You're such an idiot.

                         ALYSSA
               No, he's got a point.  That's how I 
               was in high school - I was nervous, 
               and inhibited about being eaten out.  
               But by the time I got to college, that 
               all changed.  I loosened up.  Not only 
               did I learn to communicate - I learned 
               to be bossy.  
               I was like one of those guys at the 
               airport with those big flash lights - 
               waving them this way, directing them 
               that way, telling them when to stop.

                         BANKY
               And that's all I'm saying, it'd be 
               different if chicks helped out - 
               pointed a guy in the right direction.  
               Then there'd be no bullshit, no wasted 
               time, and no chance for permanent 
               injuries.

                         ALYSSA
               Permanent injuries?

                         BANKY
               Sure.  You wanna see something 
               permanent!
                    (pulls our front tooth)
               I got this from Nina Rollins, 
               sophomore year.  I'm going down on 
               her, and out of nowhere, her cat jumps 
               on her stomach.  She does this big ol' 
               pelvic thrust - cracks my tooth in 
               half, sends it down my throat.  I had 
               to get a crown for the stub.

                         ALYSSA
                    (to Holden)
               I got that beat.
                    (to Banky)
               I got that beat.
                    (half-turns and lifts chin)
               Sophomore year.  I'm going down on 
               Cynthia Slater in her dorm room after 
               we went club-hopping.  I'm totally 
               drunk, and in the middle of it, I fall 
               asleep - right there in her lap.  She 
               got so mad, she digs her heel into my
               back, right there.
                    (points to scar)
               That's permanent.

                         BANKY
               You see this!
                    (moves neck slightly right)
               That's the farthest I can move my neck 
               to the right Sophomore year, I'm going 
               out with Maria Bennert, and for six 
               months, I'm going down on her, and not 
               a damn thing's happening.  
               Then one night, I change a position, 
               or vary my lapping-speed, and suddenly 
               it's a whole new world.  She's moving 
               around, convulsing, breathing heavy.  
               And her legs are pressing against my 
               ears so tightly that I don't hear her 
               father come into the room.  He grabs 
               my hair...
                    (grabs his own hair and pulls 
                    back)
               ...and he pulls me way back, hard.

                         ALYSSA
                    (throws up her leg, and rolls 
                    up pants)
               Senior year.  Spring Formal.  I'm 
               eating our Missy Kurt in her brother's 
               car.  She's laying across the back 
               seat, and I'm half-hanging out of the 
               car, my knees on the ground.  She's 
               flailing around, and she knocks the 
               parking brake off.  The car starts 
               rolling down the hill, and my right 
               knee is cut up all to shit like a 
               kiddy's scissor class cut it up for 
               paper dolls.

     Banky and Alyssa laugh.  Holden looks at a small scar on 
     his arm and thinks better about mentioning it.  Then Kim 
     re-enters and plants a big kiss on Alyssa's neck.

                         HOLDEN
                    (off Banky's watch)
               Holy shit, is that the time.  We've 
               gotta beat traffic.

                         BANKY
               What traffic - it's one thirty in the 
               morning!

                         HOLDEN
                    (getting up)
               And rush hour starts in six hours.  
               Let's go.
                    (to Alyssa)
               Thanks for inviting us out.  It was... 
               educational.

     Alyssa waves at him as he exits.  Banky slides out of the 
     booth.

                         BANKY
                    (to Kim)
               Since you like chicks, right.. 
               do you just look at yourself in the 
               mirror all the time?

     Holden reaches in and pulls Banky out.  Alyssa watches 
     them go, then turns and kisses Kim.



     INT. M-TV EXEC'S OFFICE WAITING ROOM - DAY

     Holden looks preoccupied.  Banky flips through magazines, 
     biting off mini pieces of the gum he's chewing.  He 
     sticks them between pages, presses the mag closed, picks 
     up another one and then repeats the whole process.  A 
     Receptionist types.

                         BANKY
                    (off Holden's look)
               You're still dwelling on the dyke, 
               aren't you?

                         HOLDEN
               Lower your voice.

                         BANKY
               What'd I tell you - she just needs the 
               right guy.  All every woman really 
               wants - be it mother, senator, nun - 
               is some serious deep-dicking.

     The Receptionist stops typing and looks at Banky, 
     shocked.

                         BANKY
                    (off her look)
               Don't give me that look - I heard Adam 
               Curry say worse.

     The Secretary goes back to typing.  Banky shrugs at 
     Holden.

                         BANKY
               That's why I can't buy lesbians.  
               Everyone needs dick.  See, I can buy 
               fags.  Bunch of guys that need dick - 
               just plain need it?  That I get.  
               Dykes?  Bullshit posturing.  But - 
               live and let live, I guess.

                         HOLDEN
               I'm sure the gay community appreciates 
               your support.

     JOHN SLOSS, the boy's lawyer, joins them.

                         SLOSS
               Please tell me you haven't blown this 
               deal already.

                         BANKY
               Sloss like a mother fucker.
                    (slaps his hand)

                         SLOSS
               Hey, every mother but your's - a 
               shyster's gotta have his standards. 
               Shall we?



     INT. M-TV EXEC'S OFFICE - DAY

     The EXECS are a casual couple of guys, sitting on couches 
     across from our trio.

                         EXEC 1
               We just want to start off by saying 
               that it's a pleasure to finally meet 
               you.  While it's been - shall we say - 
               an experience dealing with Sloss here, 
               one of the main reasons we started 
               this whole thing was to meet the guys 
               that do 'Bluntman and Chronic'.

                         EXEC 2
                    (points at them)
               'Snootchie Bootchies'.

     The Execs and Sloss laugh.  Holden and Banky politely 
     join in.  Banky shoots Holden a 'these guys are idiots' 
     look.

                         EXEC 1
               Which brings us to our proposal: we 
               are extremely interested in doing 
               twelve, half-hour 'Bluntman and 
               Chronic' cartoons.  The age of Beavis 
               is coming to a close, and we're 
               looking for something... something...

                         BANKY
               Even more retarded and juvenile to 
               sate the voracious, intellectually-
               challenged miscreants that make up 
               your key demographic.

     The Execs laugh hard.  Sloss secretly shrugs to Banky and 
     gives the thumbs up.

                         EXEC 1
                    (composes himself)
               So what do you say! Are we in 
               business!

     Banky leans back into the couch, wearing a thoughtful 
     face.  He looks to Holden, then to Sloss.  Sloss nods in 
     understanding.

                         SLOSS
               Jim, Sean - could we have a few 
               minutes!

                         EXEC 2
                    (looks to Exec 1)
               Uh... absolutely.  We'll just..

                         EXEC 1
               Uh...wait outside

     The Exec's smile and head our, closing the door behind 
     then.  Sloss turns to Banky.

                         SLOSS
               So?  Did I do good?

                         BANKY
               You did better - you sold us out!

     They clasp hands and quietly explode in ebullience.

                         SLOSS
               Do you know how much you'll make on 
               merchandising alone!

                         BANKY
                    (as Simon Bar Sinister)
               Money and Power, and Money and 
               Power...

                         SLOSS
                    (joins in)
               Money dnd Power, and Money and...

                         HOLDEN
                    (interrupting)
               I don't think it's a good idea.

     Banky and Sloss freeze.  They stare at Holden.

                         BANKY
               What's not a good idea!  Please don't 
               say the cartoon, please don't say the 
               cartoon...

                         HOLDEN
               The cartoon.

                         SLOSS
               What?!?  Are you out of your fucking 
               mind!

                         BANKY
                    (getting up)
               John, let me handle this.
                    ( to Holden)
               You are out of your fucking mind, 
               aren't you!

                         HOLDEN
               Is this how you want to be remembered!  
               As the guy who created Bluntman and 
               Chronic!

     Banky sits at the Exec's desk and starts rifling through 
     the guy's stuff.

                         BANKY
               No, I'd like to be remembered as the 
               filthy rich guy who created Bluntman 
               and Chronic.

                         HOLDEN
               But it'll be all glossy and main-
               stream.  We'll lose any artistic 
               credibility we ever had.

                         SLOSS
                    (to Banky)
               Is it me!  I don't see the problem.

                         BANKY
                    (to Sloss)
               He just has to get over this crush of 
               his.

                         SLOSS
               Oh God - not on Carrie Fisher again!
                    (to Holden)
               Holden - she's not really a Princess.

                         BANKY
                    (opening drawer with a letter 
                    opener)
               Not on her; on Alyssa Jones - the 
               chick that does that comic book 
               'Idiosyncratic Routine'.  You ever 
               seen it?

                         SLOSS
               Please.  Like I even read your comic, 
               let alone anyone else's,
                    (to Holden)
               I'm not limited to offering you legal 
               counsel only, my friend.  I'm also 
               learned in the ways of the heart, and 
               can offer you this advice - nail her, 
               get it out of your system, and move 
               on.  Like we say at Sloss Law - good 
               fences make good neighbors.

                         BANKY
               She'd never let him in her yard.  The 
               chick's gay.

                         SLOSS
                    (laughing)
               She's gay?  You fell for a gay, comic-
               book writing chick?  Holden, you poor, 
               poor man!
                    (beat)
               Wait a sec - does she have 
               representation!

                         BANKY
               Always working, you.
                    (holds up a Polaroid of a 
                    naked woman)
               Look at this - Mrs. M-TV Exec has a 
               string of pearls hanging our of her 
               ass,

                         SLOSS
               Would you leave his stuff alone!
                    (to Holden)
               You can break her resolve, killer.  
               All it takes is one good man.  But if 
               it takes two good men, don't hesitate 
               to call me.  That being said, in 
               regards to the more pressing issue, I 
               suggest you leave art to the museums 
               and grab on with both hands to the 
               big, fat check.

                         HOLDEN
               I'll give it some thought

                         BANKY
                    (holding up Polaroid)
               I'm taking this as a precaution - just 
               in case they give us any shit about 
               pussy's decision delay.
                    (glaring at Holden)
               You'll 'give it some thought'.  You're 
               so retarded

                         HOLDEN
               I'm retarded!  This from the guy who 
               only forty five minutes ago paid fifty 
               bucks for what's supposed to be a boot-
               leg of 'March of the Wooden Soldiers' 
               with a deleted scene of Stan Laurel 
               wearing a French Tickler.

                         SLOSS
               How'd you fall for that!

                         BANKY
               The guy who sold it to me had an 
               honest face.



     INT. STUDIO - DAY

     There is a door.  There's a knock at the door.  Holden 
     opens it and Alyssa is standing there.

                         ALYSSA
               Somebody told me that they make comic 
               books here, and I've got an idea for 
               this story about a guy who comes to a 
               club and high-tails it when he finds 
               out this girl is pay.  Any interest in 
               a story like that!

     Holden smiles.



     EXT. RIVERFRONT PARK - DAY

     Alyssa and Holden walk through the park, eating hot dogs.

                         ALYSSA
               M-TV?

                         HOLDEN
               Twelve episodes.

                         ALYSSA
               That's great, isn't it?

                         HOLDEN
               Banky seems to think so.

                         ALYSSA
               But you don't.

     They come to a swing set and sit down on the swings.

                         HOLDEN
               I don't know if that's the perception 
               I want people to have of our stuff.  I 
               know this sounds pretentious as hell, 
               but I like to think of us as artists.  
               And I'd like to get back to doing 
               something more personal - like our 
               first book.

                         ALYSSA
               Well when are you going to do that?

                         HOLDEN
                    (beat)
               As soon as we have something personal 
               to say.

                         ALYSSA
               Do you know how pretty you are?

                         HOLDEN
               What?

                         ALYSSA
               You're a pretty man.

                         HOLDEN
               Uh... thanks.

                         ALYSSA
               Oh.  I get it.  I'm into girls, so I 
               have to find all men repulsive or 
               something.

                         HOLDEN
               I didn't say anything.

                         ALYSSA
               Aren't there some men that you find 
               attractive?  Granted, not enough to 
               sleep with, but still - just handsome 
               or something!

                         HOLDEN
               Sure.  Harrison Ford.  And our mail-
               man.

                         ALYSSA
               Well it's the same thing.  I look at 
               you and just find you really handsome.  
               And you know, it has very little to do 
               with your look, per-se.  Your look is 
               fine, don't get me wrong.  But it's 
               more your outlook.  The things you 
               say, the way you see things.  It's... 
               I don't know... attractive,

     Holden looks away, embarrassed,

                         ALYSSA
               I weirded you our the other night

                         HOLDEN
               Huh!  No, not really.

                         ALYSSA
               Come on.

                         HOLDEN
                    (beat)
               It's just that we've.., I mean, I've 
               never seen that kind of thing up close 
               and personal.  It just took awhile to 
               process, longer than usual.

                         ALYSSA
               Do you want to talk about it!

                         HOLDEN
               Um.  If you want to.

                         ALYSSA
               I like you.  I haven't liked a man in 
               a long time.  And I'm not a man-hater 
               or something.  It's just been some 
               time since I've been exposed to a man 
               that didn't immediately live-into a 
               stereotype of some sort.  And I want 
               you to feel comfortable with me, 
               because I want us to be friends.  So 
               if there are things you'd like to 
               know, it's okay to ask me.

                         HOLDEN
                    (beat)
               Why girls?

                         ALYSSA
                    (beat)
               Why men?

                         HOLDEN
               Because that's the standard

                         ALYSSA
               If that's the only reason you're 
               attracted to women - because it's the 
               standard..

                         HOLDEN
               It's more than that.

                         ALYSSA
               So you've never been curious about 
               men?

                         HOLDEN
               Curious about men?  Well... I always 
               wondered why my father watched 'Hee-
               Haw'.

                         ALYSSA
               You know what I mean.

                         HOLDEN
               No.

                         ALYSSA
               Why not!

                         HOLDEN
               No interest.

                         ALYSSA
               Because...?

                         HOLDEN
               Girls feel right.

                         ALYSSA
               And that's how I feel.  I've never 
               really been attracted to men.  I'm 
               more comfortable with the idea of 
               girls.

                         HOLDEN
               Wait, wait, wait - you're still a 
               virgin?

                         ALYSSA
               No.

                         HOLDEN
               But you've only been with girls.

                         ALYSSA
               You're saying a person's a virgin 
               until they've had intercourse with a 
               member of the opposite sex?

                         HOLDEN
               Isn't that the standard definition?

                         ALYSSA
               Again with the standards.  I think 
               virginity is lost when you make love 
               for the first time.

                         HOLDEN
               With a member of the opposite sex.

                         ALYSSA
               Why?  Why only then?

                         HOLDEN
               Because that's the standard.

                         ALYSSA
               So if a virgin is raped, then she's 
               still a virgin?

                         HOLDEN
               Of course not.

                         ALYSSA
               But rape is not the standard.  So 
               she's had sex, but not the standard 
               idea of sex.  Hence, according to  
               your definition, she'd still be a 
               virgin.

                         HOLDEN
               Okay, I'll revise.  Virginity is lost 
               when the hymen is broken.

                         ALYSSA
               Then I lost my virginity at ten, 
               because I fell on a fence post when I 
               was ten, and it broke my hymen.  Now I 
               have to tell people that I lost it to 
               a wooden post I'd known my whole young 
               life?

                         HOLDEN
               Second revision - virginity is lost 
               through penetration.

                         ALYSSA
               Physical penetration or emotional?

                         HOLDEN
               Emotional?

                         ALYSSA
               Well, I fell in love hard with Caitlin 
               Bree when we were in high school.

                         HOLDEN
               Physical penetration.

                         ALYSSA
               We had sex.

                         HOLDEN
               Yeah, but not real sex.

                         ALYSSA
               I move to have that remark stricken 
               from the record.  On account of it 
               makes you come off as completely naive 
               and infantile.

                         HOLDEN
               Well where's the penetration in 
               lesbian sex.

     Alyssa holds up her hand.

                         HOLDEN
               A finger?  Come on.  I've had my 
               finger in my ass but I wouldn't say 
               I've had anal sex.

                         ALYSSA
               Did I hold up a finger?
                    (waves her hand)

                         HOLDEN
                    (beat; then he gets it)
               You're kidding?!?!
                    (she nods)
               How...?!?

                         ALYSSA
               Our bodies are built to pass a child, 
               for Christ's sake.

                         HOLDEN
               But doesn't it hurt?!

                         ALYSSA
               Sure.  But in a good way.  And it's 
               only a once-in-awhile thing - reserved 
               for really special occasions.

                         HOLDEN
               What about not-so-special occasions?

                         ALYSSA
               Tongue only.

                         HOLDEN
               But how can that be enough?  I mean, 
               let's be real - how big can a tongue 
               even get?

     Alyssa swallows what she's chewing and releases her 
     tongue, which is just huge.  Holden is transfixed.  
     Alyssa wraps it back up and smiles, standing.

                         ALYSSA
               Let's go.

     She exits. Holden remains in the swing.  Alyssa comes 
     back in.

                         ALYSSA
               Come on.

                         HOLDEN
               Just...uh... just give me a moment.



     INT AIRPORT - DAY

     Holden enters. Banky tries to balance way-too-much 
     luggage.

                         HOLDEN
               Look at you.  It's a two day trip.

                         BANKY
               I got the Sega in one bag, my clothes 
               in the other, and two months worth of 
               unread comics in this one.

                         HOLDEN
               We're going to a convention, for the 
               love of God.  We'll be busy from ten 
               'till eight each day. 
               When are you possibly going to have 
               time for any of that shit?  In fact, 
               fuck it - you're leaving some of this 
               shit here in a locker.  Come on - give 
               me the two that aren't clothes.

                         BANKY
               Hold on.
                    (starts rifling through one 
                    bag)

                         HOLDEN
               What are you doing?

                         BANKY
               I just have to get something.
                    (pulls out a huge stack of 
                    porno books)

                         HOLDEN
               Who are you, Larry fucking Flynt?  
               What are you going to do with all of 
               those?

                         BANKY
               Read the articles.  What do you think 
               I'm going to do with them?  They're 
               stroke books.

                         HOLDEN
               You've got like thirty books there!  
               We're only there for two days!

                         BANKY
                    (leafing through mags)
               Variety's the spice of life.  I like a 
               wide selection.  Sometimes I'm in the 
               mood for nasty close-ups, sometimes I 
               like them arty and air-brushed.  Some 
               times it's a spread brown-eye kind of 
               night, sometimes it's girl-on-girl 
               time.  Sometimes a steamy letter will 
               do it, sometimes - not often, but 
               sometimes - I like the idea of a chick 
               with a horse.

     A beeping sound is heard.  Holden checks his beeper.

                         HOLDEN
               Go check us in.  I've gotta call 
               Alyssa.

                         BANKY
               His master's voice.

                         HOLDEN
               Put that stuff away.

     Holden exits.  Banky starts packing his mags up.  A 
     little KID enters, staring at him.

                         KID
               What are those?

                         BANKY
                    (looks at kid then books)
               Do you Like horsies?

     Holden finishes dialing the phone.  Cross cut between him 
     and Alyssa at home.

                         ALYSSA
               I hope for the sake of the women 
               you've dated that you're only this 
               quick in returning calls.

                         HOLDEN
               What's up?  I'm about to get on a 
               plane.

                         ALYSSA
               Ohhh.  Why!

                         HOLDEN
               Last minute invite to the Dragon Con'.

                         ALYSSA
               Shit.

                         HOLDEN
               What?

                         ALYSSA
               My sister's at my parents'.  I was 
               gonna go see her.

                         HOLDEN
               The one that wrote the book?

                         ALYSSA
               Yeah.  But I was staying all weekend, 
               and I wanted to hang our with you.  
               This sucks.

                         HOLDEN
               You didn't get invited to the Con'?

                         ALYSSA
               I don't do southern con's - all the 
               chicks have that annoying drawl.  You 
               know how hard it is nor to laugh when 
               someone moans "Fuhhk me"?

                         HOLDEN
               Well this sucks.
                    (thinks)
               You know - both of us don't have to 
               go.

                         ALYSSA
               Really?

                         HOLDEN
               Yeah.  Banky can go by himself.  It's 
               not like we're on a panel.  It was 
               just a signing appearance.

                         ALYSSA
               If you come pick me up, I'll be your 
               best friend.

                         HOLDEN
                    (beat)
               Where's your apartment?

                         ALYSSA
               I'm not there.  I'm at a friend's - in 
               the Village.  Corner of Houston and 
               Mercer.  Number eighty six, apartment 
               6-D.

                         HOLDEN
               I'll be there in half an hour.

                         ALYSSA
               You're so easy.

     They hang up.  Holden reacts to something OC and exits 
     quickly.

     C11. Banky points to pictures in the book.  The kid looks 
     on.

                         BANKY
               ...And then Black Beauty couldn't take 
               it any longer, and he finally did some 
               of his own mounting.

                         KID
                    (off book)
               Wow.

     Holden grabs Banky's arm and drags him away.

                         HOLDEN
               What are you doing?

                         BANKY
                    (waving to kid)
               I think I want kids of my own one day.  
               They're fun.

                         HOLDEN
               Listen to me - I'm not going.  You're 
               going to have to do this one by 
               yourself.

                         BANKY
               What?  Why?

                         HOLDEN
               Alyssa's coming down for the weekend, 
               so I want to hang out with her.  You 
               don't need me for this.
                    (taking his excess baggage)
               Meantime,  I'll take this stuff home.  
               You can keep the filth.  I'll pick you 
               up at nine Sunday night, alright?  
               Don't forget to plug the Annual and 
               don't mention the t.v. show, okay?  
               Call me if you get bored.

     And he's gone.  Banky stands there, open-mouthed.  A 
     check-in FLIGHT ATTENDANT comes up to him.  His name-tag 
     reads 'Frank'.

                         FLIGHT ATTENDANT
               Checking in, sir!

                         BANKY
                    (still watching Holden go)
               Hunhh!
                    (looks at F.A.)
               Yeah.  But this is carry-on.

                         F.A.
               Federal aviation security law requires 
               me to ask if you've been given any 
               strange gifts or parcels to carry-on 
               since arriving at the airport today.

                         BANKY
                    (thinks)
               Not this trip.  But one time, when I 
               was using curb side check-in, this sky-
               cap gave me a cock ring and a set of 
               anal ben-wa balls.  I always thought 
               that was pretty strange.  He said his 
               name was Frank.
                    (looks closely at him)
               Hey!  You're name's Frank!

     Banky storms away.  The Flight Attendant watches him go.

                         F.A.
               Fucking kids.



     EXT APARTMENT 6-D - DAY

     Holden knocks at the door.  It opens.  A WOMAN is 
     standing in the doorway in her bra She looks Holden up 
     and down and smirks.

                         WOMAN
               Let me guess - 'the right man'?

                         HOLDEN
               Excuse me?

                         WOMAN
               You've got it in your head that 
               Alyssa's not really into chicks - that 
               she just hasn't met the right man.  
               And you believe you're it.  You're 
               going to treat her right, fuck her 
               like a stud, and 'straight-jacket' her 
               back from the land of the lost.  And 
               the sad truth is that you'll 
               accomplish none of that and wind up as 
               either an even more bitter misogynist 
               or a reverse fag-hag.

     Holden's at a loss.  Alyssa slips past the Woman, 
     carrying an overnight bag.

                         ALYSSA
               Don't mind her.  That's just her way a 
               saying hello.

                         WOMAN
               Actually, it's just my way of saying 
               "Give it up."

                         ALYSSA
                    (to Woman)
               You're such an asshole.

                         WOMAN
               When you file the date-rape charges, 
               don't say I didn't warn you.

                         HOLDEN
                    (holding out hand)
               I'm Holden, by the way.

                         WOMAN
               I'm the voice of reason that Miss 
               Bitch is having such a hard time 
               listening to.

                         HOLDEN
               Look, we're just friends.

                         WOMAN
               That's what every guy says before he 
               tries purring your hand on his dick.

                         HOLDEN
               And how do you know men so well?

                         WOMAN
               Because I lapdance for a living, dick-
               head.

     She slams the door. Holden looks to Alyssa.

                         ALYSSA
               Ohhh - you look so cute!

     She heads down the stairs.

                         HOLDEN
               Who was that?

                         ALYSSA
               Just an occasional friend.

                         HOLDEN
               Why would you want to hang our with 
               someone bitter as that?

                         ALYSSA
                    (stops)
               Remember this!
                    (sticks out huge tongue)
               Her's is even bigger than that.

     She smiles and continues on.  Holden looks back up at the 
     door.  He sticks his own tongue our and sizes it with his 
     fingers.



     EXT TURNPIKE - DAY

     The car sits in traffic.



     INT CAR - DAY

     Holden sighs.  Alyssa plays with the radio.

                         ALYSSA
               You were raised Catholic, right?

                         HOLDEN
               Yeah.  You?

                         ALYSSA
               Baptist.

                         HOLDEN
               Really?  Did you have a strict 
               upbringing?

                         ALYSSA
               Please There was no time to be bad - 
               we were too busy saying 'Jesus'.

                         HOLDEN
               You think your upbringing had 
               something to do with your lifestyle 
               choice?

                         ALYSSA
               Somewhere along the line.  It's a 
               gradual transition to make - from 
               doing what the majority does to taking 
               a leap of faith and doing what feels 
               more natural.  Everything helps - from 
               the way you were handled as a kid, to 
               the way the boys acted in third grade, 
               to the shoes you wore at your freshman 
               prom.

                         HOLDEN
               Shoes?

                         ALYSSA
               Well they were really tight.



     HANGING OUT MONTAGE BEGINS

     With the requisite music, over which we hear a 
     conversation between Holden and Alyssa.

     1) Holden and Alyssa sit in the DINER eating.  Holden's 
     talking.  The Waitress walks past and drops her pad.  She 
     bends over, to pick it up, hiking her mini-skirt up in 
     the process.  Alyssa stares at her ass.  Holden stops 
     talking and stares at her.  Alyssa looks over at him and 
     offers a caught smile.

     2) Holden pushes a shopping cart at the FOOD STORE, 
     throwing various things into the basket.  Alyssa comes up 
     with a box of Tampons and throws them in.  Holden glances 
     at them, a bit flushed.  Alyssa catches him, picks up the 
     box, and pulls one out.  She proceeds to demonstrate 
     their usage, throwing one leg on the can and miming 
     insertion.  Holden puts up his hands in the "I know, I 
     know," fashion.

     3) In the Studio, Holden displays some of his artwork to 
     Alyssa, during which she pulls out a cigarette and goes 
     to light it.  It's a child-proof lighter, so she's having 
     trouble.  Holden grows a little frustrated.  Finally, he 
     grabs the lighter and pulls the child proof tab out with 
     his teeth.  Alyssa stares at him a bit taken aback.  
     Holden spits the tab out, and lights Alyssa's smoke.  He 
     then continues with his display.

     4) Holden and Alyssa at the COMIC BOOK STORE.  Steve-Dave 
     and the Fan-Boy eye them suspiciously.  Alyssa pays for a 
     comic.  Steve-Dave glowers at Holden.  He gives Alyssa 
     her change and they exit.  Steve-Dave goes back to his 
     card game with the Fan-Boy.  Suddenly, a garbage can 
     comes crashing through their window.  Steve-Dave rips a 
     check off the garbage can and punches the counter.  The 
     Fan-Boy rubs his back soothingly,

     5) Holden and Alyssa walk through a PARKING LOT, talking.  
     She takes his hand and pulls his arm around her shoulder. 
     Holden smiles to himself.

                         HOLDEN V.O.
               Let me ask you something - we get 
               along, right?

                         ALYSSA V.O.
               Famously.

                         HOLDEN V.O.
               We have a definite chemistry?

                         ALYSSA V.O.
               So it would seem.

                         HOLDEN V.O.
               But we're both into girls.

                         ALYSSA V.O.
               I'm into women.

                         HOLDEN V.O.
               But you weren't always gay.

                         ALYSSA V.O.
               When I was nine I had a crush on Scott 
               Baio.

                         HOLDEN V.O.
               So If we'd met a long time ago, say in 
               high school...

                         ALYSSA V.O.
               ...I'd still be muff-diving, yes.

                         HOLDEN V.O.
               Thought so.



     INT STUDIO - DAY

     Holden and Banky play EA Sports Hockey on Sega.  There's 
     a knock at the door.

                         HOLDEN
               Come in.

     Alyssa enters and stands besides them, smiling at their 
     game.

                         ALYSSA
               I read somewhere that guys who play 
               hockey are merely making up for penile 
               deficiencies by carrying big sticks.

                         BANKY
               I thought you lived in the city?  This 
               is like the umpteenth time I've seen 
               you here.  Isn't that grounds enough 
               for the little pink mafia to throw you 
               out of their club?

                         HOLDEN
                    (hits Banky; to Alyssa)
               I'll be ready in a second.  
               I just have to school this mouthy 
               second-stringer.

                         BANKY
               Bitch, you're schooling no one.

     They play.  Cut back and forth between the game and 
     Banky, Holden, and Alyssa.

                         HOLDEN
                    (off game)
               What?  Do something!

                         BANKY
                    (off game)
               You fucking cock-teaser.  I'll knock 
               your fucking teeth out and pass all 
               over your ass.

                         HOLDEN
               Look at how slow you are.  Christ, you 
               move like a geriatric.

                         BANKY
                    (screaming at screen)
               Fuck!  You Fucking cock-sucker, man!  
               These faggots won't do what I tell 
               them to!

                         HOLDEN
               Oh. It's the controller, right?  It's 
               always the controller.

                         BANKY
               No, it's these... fucking queers on 
               blades that can't accept a fucking 
               pass to save their lives!  What period 
               is this?

                         HOLDEN
               Final sixty of the third.

                         BANKY
               Fuck!  Look at your fucking guys, 
               they... FUCK!!!
                    (whips controller)
               FUCKING COCK SUCKER, MAN!  I SWEAR TO 
               GOD!

     Banky storms away.  Alyssa looks at Holden,

                         HOLDEN
               Imagine if I'd only beaten him by one 
               instead of thirty.



     INT SKEE-BALL ARCADE - DAY

     Holden feeds a couple dollars into the change machine.  
     Alyssa looks on.

                         ALYSSA
               Explain this again.

                         HOLDEN
               How could you have grown up down the 
               shore and never played skee-ball?  
               What did you do with your youth?

     They head toward the skee-ball runs.

                         ALYSSA
               Stayed out late, smoked pot, screwed 
               around.

                         HOLDEN
               Not your grade school years; your high 
               school years.

                         ALYSSA
                    (off skee-ball run)
               This looks complicated.

                         HOLDEN
                    (Inserts coin and pulls 
                    lever)
               The premise is very basic - you roll 
               the ball up the ramp at varying 
               speeds, in an effort to pop it into 
               the score circles.  The higher the 
               score, the more prize tickets you get.

                         ALYSSA
               What do you do with the prize tickets?

                         HOLDEN
               Trade them in for prizes that aren't 
               worth nearly as much as you paid to 
               play the game.

                         ALYSSA
               Then what's the point?

                         HOLDEN
               It's fun.

                         ALYSSA
               And you question my lifestyle.

                         HOLDEN
               Observe.

     Holden rolls the ball.  It pops into a twenty point 
     circle.

                         HOLDEN
               See?  It's just that simple.

                         ALYSSA
               Why not just walk up there and put it 
               in the fifty every time?

                         HOLDEN
               Where's the skill in that?

                         ALYSSA
               Oh, this is a skill?  I'm sorry, I had 
               no idea.

                         HOLDEN
               Just toss one.

     Alyssa picks up a ball, squints to aim, and whips it 
     overhand.  It pops off one of the circles and shoots back 
     at them, missing them as they duck.  An OC knock and an 
     "OW!" is heard.  Holden reacts as Alyssa laughs.

                         HOLDEN
                    (to OC guy)
               I'm sorry, man.  She's new at this.

     Holden ducks as the ball comes sailing back at his head.  
     He gets up.

                         HOLDEN
                    (to OC)
               Thank you.
                    (hands Alyssa another ball)
               Underhand.  Throw it underhand.

                         ALYSSA
               This is where you take straight chicks 
               on dates?

                         HOLDEN
               It's like Spanish Fly.  This'll 
               probably be the first time I don't 
               score afterwards.

                         ALYSSA
               I don't know.  I'm starting to get a 
               tingle in my bottom.
                    (tosses a ball)
               Ten.

                         HOLDEN
                    (grabs a ball)
               So what'd you do last night?
                    (prepares to throw)

                         ALYSSA
               Got laid

     Holden whips the ball in surprise.  It ricochets off the 
     ceiling and through the glass of an old pinball machine.  
     Alyssa laughs.  Holden looks around, nervously.

                         ALYSSA
               Some more of that skill you were 
               telling me about?

                         HOLDEN
               Maybe we should just leave before 
               somebody gets hurt.

                         ALYSSA
               No way.  I want a cheap prize.
                    (throws a ball)
               So your friend's quite the homophobe.

                         HOLDEN
               He just feels left out, I think.

                         ALYSSA
               I'm not talking about his infantile 
               hang-up with me.  I'm talking about 
               when you two were playing that game.  
               Everytime he swore - when his players 
               messed up, he called them cocksuckers, 
               he referred to the players as queers, 
               he called you a cock-teaser...

                         HOLDEN
               I thought he was talking to you.

                         ALYSSA
               I know you think it means nothing, and 
               it may in fact be unintentional, but 
               it's ugly all the same.

                         HOLDEN
               He was just pissed he was losing.

                         ALYSSA
               So he slams the gay community?

                         HOLDEN
               C'mon.  Don't get all p.c. on me.

                         ALYSSA
               I'm not.  But what is that saying?

                         HOLDEN
               It says he gets too easily frustrated.

                         ALYSSA
               It's passive/agressive gay-bashing.

                         HOLDEN
               How do you figure?

                         ALYSSA
               How casually did it roll off his 
               tongue?  And that's how he expresses 
               his anger?  By calling people faggots?

                         HOLDEN
               I think you're reading too much into 
               it.

                         ALYSSA
               I think you're just so used to it that 
               it rolls off your back.  I've heard 
               the two of you play your little rank 
               out game where one insists the other 
               is gay.
                    (as the boys)
               "You're a faggot.  No, you're a 
               faggot."  It's cute and all to watch 
               you go at it like grade-schooler, but 
               it's also offensive - labeling and 
               ducking the label of being gay as if 
               it were the scarlet fucking letter.

                         HOLDEN
               You're blowing this way out of 
               proportion.  We live in a more 
               tolerant age now.  You refer to 
               yourself as a dyke.  Hooper calls 
               himself a faggot all the time...

                         ALYSSA
               Yeah, but that's what's known as 
               empowerment/disempowerment.  I call 
               myself a dyke so it's not too 
               devastating when some throwback 
               screams it at me as I'm leaving a bar 
               at night.  
               Same for Hooper - by calling himself a 
               faggot, he steals the thunder away 
               from the mouthy jerks of this world 
               who'd like to beat him to it.  But the 
               difference between us having it and 
               your friend saying it is miles wide.  
               We say it to mask the pain - you say 
               it for lack of a better expression at 
               any given moment.  No Holden, we do 
               not live in a more tolerant age.  And 
               if you think that's the case, then 
               you've been in the suburbs way too 
               long to be resuscitated.

     Holden kind of sulks.  Alyssa notices.

                         ALYSSA
               But you know what?
                    (picks up his face)
               I have more faith in you than that.
                    (rips her tickets off)
               Come on - I want my cheap prize.



     INT STUDIO - NIGHT

     Holden enters.  Banky's still playing Sega.  Holden sits 
     next to him.

                         HOLDEN
                    (off screen)
               How bad do you suck!

                         BANKY
               How was your pseudo-date?

                         HOLDEN
               Leave it alone.

                         BANKY
               That chick bugs me.

                         HOLDEN
                    (rubs his head; in baby-talk)
               Aww.  Everyone bugs you.

                         BANKY
               Get off.
                    (off game)
               Fucking faggot!  Did you see that?!  
               Your dyke courting ass just got me 
               scored on!

                         HOLDEN
                    (beat)
               You know, you should watch that.  If 
               you're going to get all bent out of 
               shape while playing the game, so much 
               so that you need to curse the t.v., 
               try not to gay-bash it, alright.  
               You're nor that kind of guy.
                    (gets up)
               And don't call her a dyke, alright?  
               She's a lesbian.

     Holden goes to his drawing table and takes off his coat.  
     Banky sits there, shocked.  He puts the controller down 
     and crosses to the drawing table.

                         BANKY
               What the fuck is going on here?

                         HOLDEN
                    (pulling out pencil)
               I'm starting a new page.

                         BANKY
                    (smacking pencil away)
               Not with this shit!  With you.  What 
               the fuck is going on with you and that 
               girl?

                         HOLDEN
               We're friends.

                         BANKY
               She's programming you.

                         HOLDEN
               I beg your pardon?  Programming?

                         BANKY
               Yeah.  And apparently, you don't even 
               realize it.  What does it matter if I 
               refer to her as a dyke, or if I call 
               the Whalers a bunch of faggots in the 
               privacy of my own office, far from the 
               sensitive ears of the rest of the 
               world?

                         HOLDEN
               It's passive/aggressive gay-bashing; 
               and I know you're not really 
               prejudiced at heart.  You should just 
               find some other way to express your 
               anger, is all I'm saying.

     Holden starts drawing.  Banky stares at him.  Then he 
     grabs the pencil out of Holden's hand and shoves him to 
     the side.  He starts drawing something.

                         HOLDEN
               What the fuck are you doing!

                         BANKY
               Bear with me here.  I just want to put 
               you through this little exercise.
                    (drawing feverishly)
               Okay, now see this?  This is a four 
               way road, okay?

     Banky draws a four-way stop.  He illustrates according to 
     his voice-over.

                         BANKY V.O.
               And dead in the center, is a crisp, 
               new, hundred dollar bill.  Now at the 
               end of each of the streets, are four 
               people, okay?  You following?  Up 
               here, we got a male-affectionate, easy-
               to-get-along-with, no political agenda 
               lesbian.  Okay?  Now down here, we 
               have a man-hating, angry-as-fuck, 
               agenda-of-rage, bitter dyke.  To this 
               side, we got Santa Claus, right?  And 
               over to this side - the Easter Bunny.

     Banky finishes drawing.  Holden's shaking his head

                         BANKY
               Which one's going to get to the 
               hundred dollar bill first?

                         HOLDEN
               What is this supposed to prove?

                         BANKY
               I'm serious.  This is a serious 
               exercise.  It's like an S.A.T. 
               question.  Which one's going to get to 
               the hundred dollar bill first - the 
               male-friendly lesbian, the man-hating 
               dyke, Santa Claus, or the Easter 
               Bunny?

                         HOLDEN
                    (beat; then pissed)
               The man-hating dyke.

                         BANKY
               Good.  Why?

                         HOLDEN
               I don't know.

                         BANKY
                    (wildly crossing out the 
                    other three)
               BECAUSE THESE OTHER THREE ARE FIGMENTS 
               OF YOUR FUCKING IMAGINATION!

     Holden storms away.  Banky follows.

                         HOLDEN
               I don't need this.  I'm going home.

                         BANKY
               She's fucking with your mind, man!  
               She knows you've got this schoolboy 
               crush and she's using it to sway your 
               way of thinking!

                         HOLDEN
               And why would she need to do that?  
               What is she Mata fucking Hari?!  What 
               does she gain?

                         BANKY
               Maybe she thinks you'll get her comic 
               picked up by Contender.  Or maybe she 
               thinks you'll change the content of 
               our book to something more political 
               and message oriented.  Or, gee - I 
               don't know - maybe because that's just 
               what dykes like to do: fuck around 
               with straight guys' heads, just so she 
               can go back to her little rug-muncher 
               club and have a good laugh with all 
               her man-hating harpy cronies about how 
               fucking stupid and easily duped men 
               are!

                         HOLDEN
               You're so out of line right now..,

                         BANKY
               You don't even know this girl!  Big 
               deal, she's from Middletown and she 
               went to North!  All the girls at North 
               were bitches and sluts anyway!  And 
               this one's got them beat by a mile 
               because she's a bitch/slut/dyke!

                         HOLDEN
               Watch your fucking mouth, is all I'm 
               going to tell you..

                         BANKY
               Oh why?  Do you get my back when she 
               bashes me?  Because I know she does.  
               And do you know why she does?  Because 
               I won't play her fucking game!

                         HOLDEN
               Sometimes your paranoia and suspicious 
               bullshit is amusing.  Sometimes it's 
               just fucking annoying as piss!

                         BANKY
               What is it about this girl?  You know 
               you have no shot at getting her into 
               bed!  Why do you bother wasting time 
               with her?  Because you're Holden 
               fucking McNeil - most persistent 
               traveller on the road that's not the 
               path of least resistance!  
               Everything's gotta be a fucking 
               challenge for you, and this little 
               relationship with that bitch is a 
               prime example of your fucking 
               condition.  Well I don't need a 
               fucking magic eight ball to look into 
               your future; you want a forecast?  
               Here - will Holden ever fuck Alyssa.
                    (shakes and looks at 
                    imaginary ball)
               What a shock - "Not fucking likely"!  
               This relationship of  your's is 
               affecting you, our work and our 
               friendship, and the time's going to 
               come when I throw down the gauntlet 
               and say it's me or her!  And then 
               what're you going to say?!

                         HOLDEN
                    (beat)
               I think you should let this one go.

                         BANKY
               No, what would you say?  Would you 
               trash twenty years of friendship 
               because you've got some idiotic notion 
               that this chick would even let you 
               sniff her panties, let alone fuck 
               her?!

                         HOLDEN
               Let it go...

                         BANKY
               What the fuck.. WHAT THE FUCK MAKES
               THIS BITCH ALL THAT IMPORTANT?!?!
     Holden looks at Banky for a long beat.

                         HOLDEN
               I'm in love with her, man.

     Banky stares at him.  Holden stares back.  Banky looks 
     into Holden's eyes.  Suddenly, he softens a bit.  He 
     drops his head.

                         BANKY
               Fuck.

     Banky walks away.  Holden watches him go and exits.



     INT DINER - NIGHT

     Holden and Alyssa sit at a booth.  Alyssa picks through 
     her food.  Holden looks at the check and pulls money from 
     his wallet.

                         HOLDEN
               I wish you were the one being pursued 
               by M-TV.

                         ALYSSA
               Oh really?

                         HOLDEN
               Sure.  Then you could sell our and 
               maybe pick up the check once in 
               awhile.

                         ALYSSA
                    (drops her fork and wipes her 
                    hands)
               We're leaving!

                         HOLDEN
               Well it's not like this is a bed and 
               breakfast,

                         ALYSSA
               I've got a little business to conduct.

     She grabs her bag and slides out of the booth.  Holden 
     watches her, then follows.

     A23. Alyssa slides up to the cashier's desk as does 
     Holden, who offers a puzzled shrug.  Alyssa offers the 
     'just wait' finger.  The CASHIER turns to her.

                         ALYSSA
               Are you an authorized deal-maker in 
               this establishment?  Do you have the 
               power to negotiate.

                         CASHIER
               You wanna haggle over the price of 
               your French Dip?

                         ALYSSA
               I want to haggle over the price of 
               fine art.

                         CASHIER
               What do you mean?

                         ALYSSA
                    (pointing OC)
               There.  By the kitchen.  That 
               painting.

                         CASHIER
               What about it?

                         ALYSSA
               The price tag says seventy five.

                         CASHIER
               So!

                         HOLDEN
                    (to Alyssa)
               Tell me you're kidding!

                         ALYSSA
               I'll give you fifty.

                         CASHIER
                    (to OC)
               Manuel!  Bring, me the Dyksiezski off 
               the wall.
                    (to Alyssa)
               All my years in the diner business, 
               I've waited for this day - the day 
               when someone wanted to buy one of the 
               pictures.

                         ALYSSA
                    (holds out hand)
               Alyssa Jones.  Pleased to meet you.

                         CASHIER
               You say you want to haggle, but you 
               don't know rule one about haggling, 
               which you just broke: you never give 
               your name.  The name is power, and to 
               give the opponent that piece of you is 
               to give away victory.

                         ALYSSA
               I'm only trying to conduct a 
               transaction.  We're not opponents.

                         CASHIER
                    (accepting painting from 
                    BUSBOY)
               Oh, but we are - if you think I'm 
               letting this beautiful piece go for 
               fifty.

                         ALYSSA
               Ah-ha!
                    (to Holden)
               Now we're haggling.



24.    INT CAR - NIGHT                                             24.

     It's drizzling outside.  Holden drives.  Alyssa hugs her 
     painting and pushes her bare feet against the windshield, 
     making footprints.

                         HOLDEN
               I've always wondered what kind of 
               people buy those things.  I can't 
               believe you talked him down to twenty 
               five!

                         ALYSSA
               It was looking shakey when he told me 
               the artist was a blind cripple with a 
               hump-back, but I held my ground.  
               There's no room for sympathy in the 
               buyer's market.

                         HOLDEN
               Where are you going to hang it?

                         ALYSSA
               I'm not.  You are.

                         HOLDEN
               You want me to hang it for you?  You 
               better hope it doesn't get out to the 
               girl-nation that you needed a man to 
               help you hang a picture.

                         ALYSSA
               You're going to hang it in your house.  
               I bought it for you.

                         HOLDEN
                    (laughs)
               Yeah, right.

                         ALYSSA
                    (looks at him)
               I'm serious.

     Holden stares at her.

                         HOLDEN
               Why?

                         ALYSSA
               Because it's captured the moment.  
               It'll be a constant reminder - not 
               just of tonight, but of our 
               introduction, the building of our 
               friendship, everything.  Make no 
               mistake about it my Friend - it's a 
               gift to you, from me, so you'll always 
               remember us.

     Holden stares ahead.  Then he swerves the wheel to the 
     right.



     EXT ROADSIDE - NIGHT

     The car pulls to the side of the road.  The rain is a bit 
     heavier now.



     INT CAR - NIGHT

     Holden throws the car into park

                         ALYSSA
               Why are we stopping?

                         HOLDEN
               Because I can't take it.

                         ALYSSA
               Can't take what?

                         HOLDEN
               I love you.

                         ALYSSA
                    (beat)
               You love me.

                         HOLDEN
               I love you.  And not in a friendly 
               way, although I think we're great 
               friends.  And not in a misplaced 
               affection, puppy-dog way, although I'm 
               sure that's what you'll call it.  And 
               it's not because you're unattainable.  
               I love you.  Very simple, very truly.  
               You're the epitome of every attribute 
               and quality I've ever looked for in 
               another person.  I know you think of 
               me as just a friend and crossing that 
               line is the furthest thing from an 
               option you'd ever consider.  But I 
               can't do this any longer.  I can't 
               stand next to you without wanting to 
               hold you.  I can't look into your eyes 
               without feeling that longing you only 
               read about in trashy romance novels.  
               I can't talk to you without wanting to 
               express my love for everything you 
               are.  I know this will probably queer 
               our friendship - no pun intended - but 
               I had to say it, because I've never 
               felt this before, and I like who I am 
               because of it.  And if bringing it to 
               light means we can't hang out anymore, 
               then that hurts me.  But I couldn't 
               allow another      day to go by without 
               getting it out there, regardless of 
               the outcome, which by the look on your 
               face is to be the inevitable shoot-
               down.  And I'll accept that But I know 
               some part of you is hesitating for a 
               moment, and if there is a moment of 
               hesitation, that means you feel 
               something too.  All I ask is that you 
               not suppress that - at least for ten 
               minutes - and try to dwell in it 
               before you dismiss it.  
               There isn't another soul on this 
               fucking planet who's ever made me the 
               person I am when I'm with you, and I 
               would risk this friendship for the 
               chance to take it to the next plateau.  
               Because it's there between you and me.  
               You can't deny that.  And even if we 
               never speak again after tonight, 
               please know that I'm forever changed 
               because of you and what you've meant 
               to me, which - while I do appreciate 
               it - I'd never need a painting of 
               birds bought at a diner to remind me 
               of.

     Holden stares at Alyssa.  She stares back.  Then she gets 
     out of the car.

                         HOLDEN
               Was it something I said?



     EXT ROADSIDE - NIGHT

     Holden gets out of the car.  It's raining pretty hard 
     now.  Alyssa's hitching up the road.  Holden reaches her.

                         HOLDEN
               What are you doing?

                         ALYSSA
               Get back in the car and get out of 
               here.

                         HOLDEN
               You're going to hitch to New York?

                         ALYSSA
               Y'ep.

                         HOLDEN
               Aren't you at least going to comment?

                         ALYSSA
               Here's my comment fuck you.

                         HOLDEN
               Why?

                         ALYSSA
               That was so unfair.  You know how 
               unfair that was.

                         HOLDEN
               It's unfair that I'm in love with you?

                         ALYSSA
               No, it's unfortunate that you're in 
               love with me.  It's  unfair that you 
               felt the fucking need to unburden your 
               soul about it.  Do you remember for a 
               fucking second who I am?

                         HOLDEN
               So?  People change.

                         ALYSSA
               Oh, it's that simple?  You fall in 
               love with me and want a romantic 
               relationship, nothing changes for you 
               with the exception of feeling hunky-
               dorey all the time.  But what about-
               me?  It's not that simple, is it?  I 
               can't just get into a relationship 
               with you without throwing my whole 
               fucking world into upheaval!

                         HOLDEN
               But that's every relationship!  
               There's always going to be a period of 
               adjustment.

                         ALYSSA
               Period of adjustment?!?
                    (hitting him)
               THERE'S NO 'PERIOD OF ADJUSTMENT' 
               HOLDEN!  I'M FUCKING GAY!  THAT'S WHO 
               I AM!  AND YOU ASSUME I CAN TURN THAT 
               AROUND JUST BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A 
               CRUSH?!?

                         HOLDEN
               If this is a crush... then I don't 
               know if I could take the real thing if 
               it ever happens.

     She looks at him, rain drenching the pair.  She shakes 
     her head ruefully.

                         ALYSSA
               Go home, Holden.

     She walks away.  Holden stands there, at a loss.  Then he 
     turns and heads back to his car.  
     As he reaches the door and turns to look back at her, 
     Alyssa pounces on him, grabs his face and locks lips with 
     him, big time.  He drops his keys and embraces her.

     And there they stand, by the side of the road, drenched 
     kissing.



     EXT STUDIO - DAY

     Banky carries a bag in one arm and pulls out his keys 
     with the other.  He jams them into the lock, opening the 
     door.  He picks up the mail on the floor.



     INT STUDIO - DAY

     He closes the door behind him and shuffles to the 
     kitchenette, passing by the blanket-covered, slumbering 
     forms of Holden and Alyssa, who are out cold in each 
     other's arms.  The place looks a mess - Like a couple of 
     people were engaged in some tremendous fucking.  Banky is 
     oblivious.  He sets the bag down on the counter and pulls 
     out a chocolate milk.  He opens it, sticks a straw into 
     the top, and begins sipping and sifting through the mail.  
     He comes to mail that's Holden's and tosses it onto the 
     couch, near Holden's head.  He looks down at the sleeping 
     couple, then back at the mail for a couple of beats.  
     Then he freezes.  He looks down again, and drops his jaw 
     and his carton of choco.  It hits the floor with a pop.  
     Holden and Alyssa shoot straight up, eyes struggling to 
     focus.  They look at one another, then at the 
     flabbergasted Banky.  Banky blinks.  Then he shuffles 
     toward the door again and lets himself out.

                         ALYSSA
                    (off Holden's reaction)
               I take it that's not good.

                         HOLDEN
                    (getting up)
               Stay here.
                    (he kisses her and exits)



     EXT STREET - DAY

     Banky sits on a curb, staring into the distance, Holden 
     saunters up and sits beside him.  He follows Banky's 
     gaze.

                         BANKY
               Catholic school girls.

     Across the street, the Catholic High School is letting 
     out.  Teenage girls clad in uniforms and tight sweaters 
     smoke, frolic, wait for their bus.

                         BANKY
               The uniform is what does it for me.  I 
               wish I'd have went with more Catholic 
               school girls when I was a kid.  As it 
               stands.  I have no "...and then she 
               unzipped her jumper..." stories.

                         HOLDEN
               You looked weirded out back there.

                         BANKY
               That's my couch you were fucking on.

                         HOLDEN
               Sorry.

                         BANKY
               I wanted to watch some TV.  Hard to do 
               when your best friend's wrapped around 
               a naked rug-muncher on your couch.

                         HOLDEN
               She had boxers on.

     Banky shoots him a glare.  He goes back to staring at the 
     OC girls.

                         BANKY
               This is all going to end badly.

                         HOLDEN
               You don't know that.

                         BANKY
               I know you.  You're way too 
               conservative for that girl.  She's 
               been around and seen things we've only 
               read about in books.

                         HOLDEN
               But we have read about them.  So we're 
               prepared.

                         BANKY
               There's no 'we' here.  You're going to 
               have to go through this alone.  And 
               it's one thing to read about shit, and 
               something different when you're forced 
               to deal with it on a regular basis.  
               When you guys are walking in the mall 
               and both your heads turn at a really 
               nice looking chick, it's going to eat 
               you up inside.  You'll spend most of 
               your time wondering when the other 
               shoe's going to drop.  Because for 
               you, this isn't about cool weird sex 
               stuff, it's about love.

                         HOLDEN
               Maybe it is for her as well.

                         BANKY
               Somehow I doubt it.

                         HOLDEN
               Everyone's not out to get someone in 
               life.  Bank.

                         BANKY
               Everybody has an agenda.  Everyone.

                         HOLDEN
               Yourself?

                         BANKY
               My agenda is to watch your back.

                         HOLDEN
               To what end?

                         BANKY
               To insure that all this time we've 
               spent together, building something, 
               wasn't wasted.

                         HOLDEN
               She's not going to ruin the comic.

                         BANKY
               I wasn't talking about the comic.
                    (gets up)
               I'm going to gel a bagel.  Clean off 
               my fucking couch so I can watch TV.

     Banky walks away.  Holden shakes his head.



     INT ALYSSA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

     An all-girl gathering. TORY. NICA, DALIA and JANE help 
     Alyssa finish an issue of 'Idiosyncratic Routine'.  Tory 
     letters a page.  Nica and Dalia lay-out the artwork.  
     Dalia drinks wine.  Alyssa paints the cover.

                         DALIA
               From what I understand, when you sign 
               with a publisher, someone else does 
               all this work for you, and you just 
               sit back and collect.

                         ALYSSA
               And miss these last minute cram 
               sessions with my nearest and dearest?  
               Never.

                         TORY
               I don't know what she's bitching 
               about.  All she's done since we got 
               here is pound Merlot.

                         DALIA
               I'm sorry weren't you the one who 
               misspelled 'receipt' on page eighteen?  
               Yeah, you're a real help.

                         NICA
               What I'd like to know is why we're 
               here at all when we haven't seen 
               Princess funny-Book in a month.

                         JANE
               Yeah Alyssa - who've you been shacking 
               up with?

                         ALYSSA
               'Shacking up!' Please.
                    (stops painting; smiles wide)
               I'm so in love!

     Everyone aww's.  Alyssa buries her face, giggling.

                         ALYSSA
               I know.  I know -I feel like such a 
               goon.  But I can't help it - we have 
               such a great time together.

                         DALIA
               Who is it?  Don't even tell me it's 
               Ms. Thing from the C.D. place.  I'll 
               kill you.

                         ALYSSA
               It's not her.  It's someone you guys 
               don't know.

                         NICA
               That chick you left the restaurant 
               with that night?

                         ALYSSA
               They're not.  From around here.

                         TORY
               Don't even tell me you met her down 
               the shore!

                         JANE
               Eww!  Not a bridge-and-tunnel Jersey 
               dyke!

                         TORY
               With huge hair and acid-washed jeans!

     They all cackle.  Alyssa tries to laugh with them.

                         DALIA
               Come on, Alyss - Hoboken Hussy or 
               what?

                         ALYSSA
               For your information, they don't have 
               big hair or wear acid wash.
                    (goes back to painting)
               They're from my home town.

     Dalia stares at Alyssa, suspiciously.

                         DALIA
               Why are you playing the pronoun game?

                         ALYSSA
               What?  What are you talking about?  
               I'm not even.

                         DALIA
               You are. "I met someone."  "We have a 
               great time.  "They're from my home 
               town."  Doesn't this tube of
               wonderful have a name!

                         ALYSSA
                    (beat)
               Holden.

     All four Girls stare at Alyssa, a bit horrified.  She 
     stops painting.

                         JANE
               Oh, Alyssa - no.  Not you.

                         TORY
               You're dating a guy?

                         ALYSSA
               He's not like a typical man.  He's 
               really sweet to me, and we relate so 
               well.  You guys'd love him, really.

     They stare at Alyssa.  Then Dalia gets up.

                         DALIA
               I've gotta go to the store.

                         JANE
               I'll go with.

     They exit.  Alyssa looks to Tory and Nica.

                         TORY
                    (pouring wine)
               Whelp - here's to both of you.
                    (moves the glass to her lips)
               Another one bites the dust.



     INT HOLDEN'S BEDROOM -NIGHT

     Holden and Alyssa lie in each other's arms, moonlight 
     bathing them.  She smokes.

                         HOLDEN
               Can I ask you something?

                         ALYSSA
               Don't even tell me you want to do it 
               again.

                         HOLDEN
               Why me - you know?  Why now?

                         ALYSSA
               Because you were giving me that look, 
               and I got wet...

                         HOLDEN
               You know what I'm talking about.

                         ALYSSA
               Why not You?

                         HOLDEN
               I'm a guy.  You're attracted to girls.

                         ALYSSA
               I see you've been taking notes. 
               Historically, yes  that's true.

                         HOLDEN
               Then why this?

                         ALYSSA
               I've given that a lot of thought, you 
               know?  I mean, now that I'm being 
               ostracized by my friends, I've had a 
               lot of time to think about all of 
               this.  And what I've come up with is 
               really simple: I came to this on my 
               terms.  I didn't just heed what I was 
               taught, you  know?  Men and women 
               should be together, it's the natural 
               way - that kind of thing.  I'm not 
               with you because of what family, 
               society, life tried to instill in me 
               from day one.  The way the world is - 
               how seldom you meet that one person 
               who gets you... it's so rare.   My 
               parents didn't really have it.  There 
               was no example set for me in the world 
               of male/female relation ships.  And to 
               cut oneself off from finding that 
               person - to immediately half your 
               options by eliminating the possibility 
               of finding that one person within your 
               own gender... that just seemed stupid.  
               So I didn't.  And by leaving my 
               options open, I was branded 'gay', 
               which to me was no big deal - labels 
               are labels, you know?  They define 
               what you do, not who you are, I guess. 
               But           then you come along.  You - 
               the one least likely; I mean, you were 
               a guy.

                         HOLDEN
               Still am.

                         ALYSSA
               And while I was falling for you, I put 
               a ceiling on that, because you were a 
               guy.  
               Until I remembered why I opened the 
               door to women in the first place - to 
               not limit the likelihood of finding 
               that one person who'd compliment me so 
               completely.  And so here we are, I was 
               thorough when I looked for you, and I 
               feel justified lying in your arms - 
               because I got here on my terms, and 
               have no question that there was 
               someplace I didn't look.  And that 
               makes all the difference.

                         HOLDEN
                    (beat)
               Shit.

                         ALYSSA
               What?

                         HOLDEN
               Well, you took the luster our of it.

                         ALYSSA
               What luster?

                         HOLDEN
                    (joking - in case you didn't 
                    get it)
               Of how I brought you back from the 
               other side.  How all you needed was 
               the right man to turn you around.

                         ALYSSA
               You're not the right man.
                    (kisses him)
               You're just the one.

     She snuggles into him and closes her eyes.  Holden stares 
     at the ceiling.

                         HOLDEN
               Can I at least cell people that all 
               you needed was some serious deep-
               dicking?

     She hits him with her pillow.



     THE BIG OL' FALLING-IN-LOVE MONTAGE BEGINS

     1) In Holden's Apartment - Alyssa waves in various 
     directions, shaking her head accordingly.  Then she puts 
     up her hands to stop.  Cut to Holden, hanging the 
     picture.  Alyssa gave him.  
     It hangs at a severely crooked angle.  He looks back to 
     her and shakes his head 'no'.

     2) Holden and Alyssa try to play a video game.  Banky 
     plays as well.  Holden instructs her in the ways of NHL 
     '96 (turning her paddle right-side-up, pointing at things 
     on the screen).  She presses the reset button, over and 
     over.  Banky gives Holden a 'What the fuck?' look.  
     Alyssa sticks her tongue at him.

     3) At the Video Store - Holden picks up a Disney cartoon 
     off the shelf.  He goes to show if to Alyssa, who's 
     reading the back of 'Anything But Dick', an allchick 
     porno.  An old WOMAN stares at her.  Holden nods to the 
     old Woman and takes the tape out of Alyssa's hands, 
     putting it back on the shelf.  He ushers her away.  The 
     old Woman waits until they're gone and then picks up the 
     tape herself,

     4) Holden carries Alyssa on his shoulders through the 
     park, her crotch against the back of his neck.  He's 
     talking. She taps him and he stops and looks up.  She 
     begins to maneuver around so her crotch is in his face.  
     He pulls her off and put her down.  She's laughing.  He's 
     flushed with embarrassment.  The same Old Woman from the 
     Video store passes by with her husband.  Holden shrugs.

     5) In Holden's Apartment again - Alyssa again with the 
     waving, then putting up her hands to stop.  Cut to Holden 
     again, this time with the painting hung completely upside 
     down.  He looks at it, then offers her a bewildered gaze.

     6) In the Office Banky comes to his drawing table.  There 
     are penciled pages on it with a note that says "Hanging 
     out with Alyssa today.  Holden".  Banky crumples it up 
     and throws it across the room.

     7) In Holden's Apartment - Alyssa waves this way, then 
     that way, then puts up her hands frantically to stop.  
     She settles back against the wall, a satisfied smile 
     crawling across her face, and closes her eyes.  We pull 
     back to reveal Holden on his knees in front of her, 
     eating her out (no, we don't see anything!).



     INT OFFICE - DAY

     Holden draws.  A book is thrown in front of him.  He 
     looks up.  Banky stands there.

                         BANKY
               Check out page forty eight.

     Holden looks down at that book.  It's the Nineteen Eighty 
     Eight yearbook from Middletown North.  He shakes his head 
     at Banky and flips it open.

     On the page is Alyssa's Senior year photo.  Under her 
     name is another name in quotes that says 'Finger Cuffs'.

                         HOLDEN
                    (looking up)
               So?

                         BANKY
               Did you see the nickname?

                         HOLDEN
               'Finger Cuffs'.

                         BANKY
               And...?

                         HOLDEN
               And... she had a weird nick-name.  
               What's your point?

                         BANKY
               Do you know why it's 'Finger Cuffs'?

                         HOLDEN
               I suppose you do.

                         BANKY
               I do.
                    (takes a seat)
               You remember Cohee Lundin?  Left 
               Hudson and went to North our senior 
               year?

                         HOLDEN
               Yeah.

                         BANKY
               Well, I ran into him at Food City the 
               other day, and we got to talking, and 
               I mentioned that you were dating 
               Alyssa, and he said..

     CUT TO COHEE LUNDON.  In the PARKING LOT of FOOD CITY, 
     addressing the camera.

                         COHEE
               Alyssa Jones?  Shit.  I know Alyssa 
               Jones.  I mean, I know Alyssa Jones, 
               you know what I'm saying?  
               Me and Rick Derris used to hang our 
               with her for awhile, right?  Just 
               hanging around her house after school,  
               'cuz her parents were like never home, 
               and shit.  And one day, Rick just 
               whips it out, and starts rubbing it on 
               her leg and shit; chasing her around 
               the living room - I was dying.  But 
               you know what the crazy bitch did?  
               She fucking drops to her knees, and 
               just starts sucking him off right in 
               front of me!  Like I wasn't even there 
               man!  I almost died!  But that's not 
               the fucked up part - the fucked up 
               part was Rick, man - right in the 
               middle of it, he turns to me and he's 
               pointing at her and he says "Cohee."  
               Just like that - "Cohee."  So I'm like 
               I'll give it a shot.  And I start 
               pulling her pants down all slow, 'cuz 
               I figure any second she's gonna turn 
               around and belt me in the mouth, 
               right?  But yo, check this shit out - 
               she's all into it man!  She don't try 
               to stop me or nothing!  She's           
               all wet and shit, and I just went to 
               work, know what I'm saying?  Me and 
               Rick are going to town on this crazy 
               bitch, and she's just loving it, all 
               moaning and shit!  It was fucked up!  
               So Rick's the one that came up with 
               the nickname - 'cuz that day, she had 
               us locked in tight from both sides - 
               like a pair of goddamn Chinese finger 
               cuffs!

     BACK IN THE OFFICE - Holden stares at Banky.

                         HOLDEN
               He's full of shit.

                         BANKY
               Cohee's a lot of things, but an 
               exxagerator he's not.  The dude's 
               Catholic.

                         HOLDEN
               She's never even been with a guy.

                         BANKY
               That's what she says.  But I say her 
               on her hands and knees getting filled 
               out like an application constitutes 
               'being with a guy'.

                         HOLDEN
               He's pulling your chain.  And the fact 
               that you even bought it for a second 
               makes you look like an idiot.

                         BANKY
               I'm getting your back, asshole!  
               People don't forget shit like 'Finger 
               Cuffs'.  And if it got out that she's 
               queer as well, how do you think it's 
               going to make you look?

                         HOLDEN
               I give a shit what people think.

                         BANKY
               Alright, forget about that; what if 
               she's carrying a disease?  That was 
               just one story - what if there's more?

                         HOLDEN
                    (grabs his coat)
               You're such a fucking asshole.

                         BANKY
               What?  Oh, it's not possible that 
               she's all crudded up?  Cohee I can 
               vouch for as clean - the dude never 
               got laid in high school.  But Derris 
               is an arch fucking bush-man!  Name me 
               one chick in our senior class that 
               Rick Derris didn't nail, for Christ's 
               sake!

                         HOLDEN
               Would you let this go?  I'm telling 
               you - she's never even been with a 
               guy, let alone those two zeroes.

                         BANKY
               And I'm telling you, the bitch could 
               be a bigger fucking germ farm than 
               that monkey in 'Outbreak'!

     Holden grabs Banky and pins him against the wall.

                         HOLDEN
               Give it a rest!  Do you hear me?!  I'm 
               tired of this shit!  She's my goddamn 
               girlfriend, do you understand?!  Show 
               her a little fucking respect!  
               And if you ever even so much as 
               mention that Alyssa looks a little 
               peaked from now on, I'll put your 
               fucking teeth down your throat!

     He releases Banky.  Banky brushes himself off.

                         BANKY
               Maybe I'll put your fucking teeth down 
               your throat.

                         HOLDEN
                    (walking out)
               Not bloody Likely.

     Banky runs to the open door.

                         BANKY
                    (calling after him)
               I've been working out you know!
                    (no response)
               You better be ready to make that M-TV 
               deal!

     The downstairs door slams.  Banky makes a muscle, then 
     feels it.



     INT TOWER RECORDS - DAY

     Holden and Hooper peruse laser discs.

                         HOOPER
               Where's that bitch partner of your's 
               been?

                         HOLDEN
               Sulking.  He's having a real problem 
               with this Alyssa thing.

                         HOOPER
               I think it's more like Banky's having 
               a problem with all things not hetero 
               right about now.  And I'm just another 
               paradigm of said aberration.

                         HOLDEN
               Banky does not hate gays, you know 
               that.

                         HOOPER
               But I do think he is a bit homophobic.  
               And this latest episode between you 
               and Ms. Thing has tapped into that.  
               In his warped perception, he lost you 
               to the dark side - which is she.

                         HOLDEN
               You make it sound like me and him were 
               dating.

                         HOOPER
               Don't kid yourself - that boy loves 
               you in a way that he's not ready to 
               deal with.

                         HOLDEN
                    (beat)
               He's been digging up dirt on Alyssa.

                         HOOPER
               And just what has Mister Angela 
               Lansbury uncovered about your lady 
               fair?

                         HOLDEN
               He heard some bullshit story that she 
               took on two guys.

                         HOOPER
               Really?  Well then he's barking up the 
               wrong we if he wants to split you up, 
               isn't he?  He's not going to make you 
               see the error of your ways by pointing 
               out how truly gay she's not
                    (holds up a disc)
               This one?

                         HOLDEN
               Have it.
                    (beat)
               Actually, it's kind of gotten to me.

                         HOOPER
               How so?

                         HOLDEN
               Banky's not known for believing 
               misinformation.  He's got a pretty 
               good bullshit detector.

                         HOOPER
               So, what if it is true?  Would that 
               bother you?

                         HOLDEN
               Sex with multiple partners?

     Hooper lets our a faux-shock shriek.

                         HOLDEN
               At the same time.

     Again, even louder, hands slapped against his cheeks.

                         HOLDEN
               Thanks for being so comforting.

                         HOOPER
               So what do you care?

                         HOLDEN
               Well that's the thing, isn't it?  I 
               shouldn't.. but it gets to me.

                         HOOPER
               Kind of gal Alyssa is, you don't think 
               she's been in the middle of an all -
               girl group-grope?

                         HOLDEN
               You see - that doesn't bother me.  But 
               the thought of her and guys... Uh!

                         HOOPER
               Oh Holden, I beg you - please don't 
               drop fifty stories in my opinion of 
               you by falling prey to that latest of 
               trendy beasts.

                         HOLDEN
               Which is?

                         HOOPER
               Lesbian chic.  It's oh-so acceptable 
               to be a gay girl nowadays.  People 
               think it's cute, because they've got 
               this fool picture in their heads about 
               lipstick lesbians - like they all 
               resemble Alyssa - while most of them 
               look more like you.

                         HOLDEN
               Do I detect a little inter-subculture 
               cattiness?

                         HOOPER
               Gay or straight - ugly's still ugly.  
               And most of those boys are scary.

                         HOLDEN
               I thought fags were all supposed to be 
               super-supportive of one another.

                         HOOPER
               Screw that 'all for one' shit.  I 
               gotta deal with being the minority in 
               the minority of the minority, and 
               nobody's supporting my ass?  While the 
               whole of society is fawning over girls-
               on-girls, here I sit - a reviled gay 
               man, and to top that off,  I'm a gay 
               black man - notoriously the most 
               swishy of the bunch.

                         HOLDEN
               Three strikes.

                         HOOPER
               Hey, hey!  There's a line.

     A young BLACK KID approaches Hooper, holding a comic 
     book.

                         KID
               Are you Hooper X?

                         HOOPER
                    (in militant mode)
               A-salaam Alaikum, little brother.

                         KID
               Could you sign my comic?

                         HOOPER
                    (signing comic; nods to 
                    Holden)
               See that guy there?  He's the devil, 
               you understand?  Never take your eye 
               off the Man.  Our people took their 
               eyes off him one time, and he had us 
               in chains in two shakes of his snake's 
               tail.

     The Kid offers Holden an angry look.  Hooper gives him 
     back his comic.

                         HOOPER
               Fight the power, little 'G'.

                         KID
               Word is bond

     The Kid leaves, Hooper slips back into his real voice.

                         HOOPER
               Look at what I have to resort to for 
               professional respect.  What is it 
               about gay men that terrifies the rest 
               of the world.
                    (shakes his head)
               As for this hang-up with Alyssa's 
               past, maybe what's really bothering 
               you is that your fragile fantasy might 
               not be true.

                         HOLDEN
               What do you mean?

                         HOOPER
               Holden - don't even try to come off 
               like you don't know what I'm saying.  
               Men need to believe that they're Marco 
               fucking Polo when it comes to sex - 
               like they're the only ones who've ever 
               explored new territory.  And it's hard 
               not to let them believe it.  I let my 
               boys run with it for awhile - feed 
               them some of that "I've never done 
               this before..." bullshit, and let 'em 
               labor under the delusion that they 
               rockin' my world, until I can't stand 
               them anymore.  Then I hit 'em with the 
               truth.  It's a sick game.  The world 
               would be a better place if people 
               would just accept that there's nothing 
               new under the sun, and everything you 
               can do with a person has probably been 
               done long before you got there.

                         HOLDEN
               I can accept that.

                         HOOPER
               Honey, that almost sounded convincing.  
               Do yourself a favor - just ask her 
               about her past, point blank.  Get it 
               out of the way, before it gets too big 
               for both ya'll to move.
                    (spotting something OC)
               Oooh!  'Myra Breckinridge'!

     Hooper trots off, Holden glances at the disc in his 
     hands.  Pictured on it are two gorgeous chicks, barely 
     clad, making out.  The title is 'Men Suck.. and so do 
     Girls - All XXX Action.'



     INT HOCKEY RINK - NIGHT

     On the ice, two teams clash, chasing the puck up and 
     back, checking galore.

     In the bleachers, amidst a slew of fans, Alyssa watches 
     the game with a large degree of enjoyment.  Sitting 
     beside her, Holden doesn't seem to share her enthusiasm.

                         ALYSSA
               Since most of these people are rooting 
               for the home team, I'm going to cheer 
               for the visitors.  I'm a big visitors 
               fan - especially the kind that make 
               coffee for you in the morning before 
               they go.
                    (smiles at Holden; no 
                    response)
               That was a joke.  A little wacky 
               wordplay?

                         HOLDEN
               What do you mean, 'visitors'?

                         ALYSSA
               Was I being too obscure?  The kind 
               that - until recently - had no dicks 
               and would spend the night.

                         HOLDEN
               So that was until recently!

                         ALYSSA
               Oh, yeah.
                    (shouting; to ice)
               Hey - foul!  Foul!  He was traveling 
               or something!

                         HOLDEN
               So nobody bur me has stayed the night 
               at your place since we got together?

                         ALYSSA
                    (beat)
               Something on your mind, Holden?

                         HOLDEN
               No, I was just wondering,

                         ALYSSA
               If I've been 'faithful' or something?

                         HOLDEN
               Look, I was just asking.

                         ALYSSA
                    (toucher his face)
               Oh, sweetie.  I only have eyes for 
               you.
                    (to ice)
               CALL THAT FUCKING SHIT, REF!!  THE GUY 
               ON THE SKATES TOTALLY SHOVED ONE OF MY 
               GUYS!!
                    (to Holden)
               I told you I was great at sporting 
               events.  Imagine what a bitch I could 
               be if I knew what was going on?

     ON THE ICE - Things heat up between two opposing PLAYERS.  
     One snatches the puck away from the other and skates off.  
     The other Player gives chase.

     Alyssa's very into the game.  Holden shakes his head

                         HOLDEN
               That'd make Banky half right.

                         ALYSSA
               About what?

                         HOLDEN
               He said all the girls from North were 
               bitches and sluts.

                         ALYSSA
               Really.  I'm sorry - you two left high 
               school behind how many years ago?
                    (grabs his face and kisses 
                    his cheek)
               Can I put some of my books in your 
               locker?
                    (goes back to watching game)

                         HOLDEN
                    (under his breath)
               How about your yearbook.

     ON THE ICE - The Player giving chase slashes the Player 
     with the puck.

     Alyssa jumps to her feet.

                         ALYSSA
                    (to ice)
               IF YOU DON'T START USING THAT WHISTLE 
               I'M GONNA JAM IT STRAIGHT UP YOUR 
               ASS!!
                    (to guy next to her)
               Right?

                         HOLDEN
               What's with 'Finger Cuffs'?

                         ALYSSA
                    (sitting back down)
               'Finger Cuffs'?

                         HOLDEN
               Yeah.  In your senior yearbook your 
               nickname was 'Finger Cuffs'.  What is 
               that?

                         ALYSSA
               It was?  Shit, damned if I can 
               remember.  I'd look it up, but I threw 
               all that shit our years ago?
                    (beat)
               Where'd you see a North yearbook?

                         HOLDEN
               Do you know Rick Derris?

     ON THE ICE - The Players skid into the corner where 
     Player One checks Player Two into the boards, hard.  
     Player Two scrambles to his feet and throws down his 
     gloves.

     The crowd around Alyssa and Holden go wild.

                         ALYSSA
               Rick?  Sure.  We used to hang out in 
               high school.
                    (to ice)
               PUNCH HIM IN THE FUCKING NECK, NUMBER 
               TWELVE!!

                         HOLDEN
               Did you go out with him or something?

                         ALYSSA
                    (eyes on the ice)
               Date Rick Derris?  No.  We just hung 
               out a lot.

                         HOLDEN
               Just... you and him?

                         ALYSSA
               No.  Me, Rick, and... um... what was 
               that guy's name...?

                         HOLDEN
               Cohee?

                         ALYSSA
               Yeah!  Cohee Lundin.  God, I haven't 
               thought about that name in years.

     ON THE ICE - The Players square off.  Player Two pulls 
     Player One's helmet off and punches him in the face.

     Holden looks as if he'd Like to do the same to his 
     companion.  Alyssa's into the game.

                         ALYSSA
               I remember those guys'd come over 
               almost everyday after school.  They'd 
               bug my sisters, look for porno tapes 
               in my dad's closet, raid our fridge.  
               They really took advantage of my 
               parents never being home.

     ON THE ICE - Player Two yanks at Player One's jersey and 
     gut punches him.  Alyssa seems oblivious to Holden's 
     anger, so enthralled with the action is she.

                         ALYSSA
                    (starts laughing)
               This one day... Rick pulled out his 
               dick and chased me around the house 
               with it!  Right in front of Cohee!  I 
               couldn't believe it!  Guys are weird - 
               I thought the whole size hang-up made 
               you all terrified to show your dicks 
               to each other?

     ON THE ICE - Player One staggers a bit, then quickly 
     rights his jersey and lunges at Player Two, landing a 
     barrage of his own punches.  Blood sprays across the ice.

     Holden's face is reeeeeaaaally sour looking.  Alyssa's 
     still in the game.

                         HOLDEN
               Rick pulled his dick out?  Really?  
               What'd you do?

                         ALYSSA
                    (looks him dead in the eye)
               I blew him while Cohee fucked me.

     ON THE ICE - Player One delivers the kill shot, slamming 
     his fist into Player Two's nose.  The blood shoots out 
     like a geyser, and Two goes down hard.

     Holden stares at Alyssa, flabbergasted.  The crowd around 
     them stares not at the fight on the ice, but the fight in 
     their midst, shocked.  Alyssa fumes.

                         HOLDEN
               Excuse me!?!

                         ALYSSA
               That's what you wanted to hear, isn't 
               it?  Isn't that what this little cross-
               examination of your's is about?  Well 
               try not to be so obvious about it next 
               time, there are subtler ways of 
               badgering a witness.
                    (to Bystander)
               Am I right?

                         BYSTANDER
                    (to Holden)
               Jeez, even I knew what you were 
               getting at.

                         ALYSSA
                    (gathering her stuff)
               If you wanted some background 
               information on me, all you had to do 
               was ask - I'd have gladly volunteered 
               it.  You didn't have to play Hercules 
               fucking Poirot!

     She storms away.  Holden chases after her.  The Bystander 
     watches them go.

                         BYSTANDER
                    (to companion)
               I told you these were good seats.



     INT RINK LOBBY / EXT PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     Alyssa marches quickly, pulling on her coat.  Holden 
     catches up to her.  We track with them our into the 
     parking lot.

                         HOLDEN
               So it's true?!

                         ALYSSA
               Yes Holden!  In fact, everything you 
               heard or dug up on me was probably 
               true!  Yeah, I took on two guys at 
               once!  You want to hear some gems you 
               might not have unearthed - I took a 
               twenty six year old guy to my senior 
               prom, and then left halfway through to  
               have sex with him and Gwen Turner in 
               the back of a limo!  And the girl who 
               got caught in the shower with Miss 
               Moffit, the gym teacher?  That was me!  
               Or how about in college, when I let 
               Shannon Hamilton videotape us having 
               sex - only to find out the next day 
               that he broadcast it on the campus 
               cable station?!  They're all true - 
               those and so many more!  Didn't you 
               know?  I'm the queen of urban legend!

                         HOLDEN
               How the hell could you do those 
               things?!

                         ALYSSA
               Easily!  Some of it I did out of 
               stupidity, some of it I did out of 
               what I thought was love, but - good or 
               bad - they were my choices, and I'm 
               not making apologies for them now - 
               not to you or anyone!  And how dare 
               you try to lay a guilt trip on me 
               about it - in public, no less!  Who 
               the fuck do you think you are, you 
               judgemental prick?!

                         HOLDEN
               How am I supposed to feel about all of 
               this?

                         ALYSSA
               How are you supposed to feel about it?  
               Feel what ever the fuck you want about 
               it!  The only thing that really 
               matters is how you feel about me.

                         HOLDEN
               I don't know how I feel about you now.

                         ALYSSA
               Why?  Because I had some sex?

                         HOLDEN
               Some sex?

                         ALYSSA
               Yes, Holden - that's all it was: some 
               sex!  Most of it stupid high school 
               sex, for Christ's sake!  Like you 
               never had sex in high school!

                         HOLDEN
               There's a world of fucking difference 
               between typical high school sex and 
               two guys at once!  They fucking used 
               you?

                         ALYSSA
               I used them!  You don't think I 
               would've let it happen if I hadn't 
               wanted it to, do you?!  I was an 
               experimental girl, for Christ's sake! 
               Maybe you knew early on that your 
               track was from point 'a' to 'b' - but 
               unlike you I wasn't given a fucking 
               map at birth, so I tried it all!  That 
               is until we - that's you and I - got 
               together, and suddenly, I was sated.  
               Can't you take some fucking comfort in 
               that?  You turned out to be all I was 
               ever looking for - the missing piece 
               in the big fucking puzzle!
                    (tries to calm down)
               Look I'm sorry I let you believe that 
               you were the only guy I'd ever been 
               with.  I should've been more honest.  
               But it seemed to make you feel special 
               in a way that me telling you over and 
               over again how incredible you are 
               would never get across.

     She touches his face.  He pulls back.  She stares at him, 
     hurt and pissed.

                         ALYSSA
               Do you mean to tell me that - while 
               you have zero problem with me sleeping 
               with half the women in New York City - 
               you have some sort of half-assed, 
               mealy-mouthed objection to pubescent 
               antics, that took place almost ten 
               years ago?  What the fuck is your 
               problem?!?

     Holden's eyes are downcast.  Alyssa waits for a response.

                         HOLDEN
               I want us to be something that we 
               can't.

                         ALYSSA
               And what's that?

                         HOLDEN
                    (beat)
               A normal couple.

     Holden skulks off.  Alyssa stares after him, and then 
     starts kicking and punching a car beside her, finally 
     slumping to the ground.  She cries.



     INT STUDIO - DUSK

     Holden sits on the couch, alone in the dark.  The door 
     opens and Banky enters.  He stands there, sizing up 
     Holden's mood.

                         BANKY
               The girl?

     Holden nods.  Banky nods back.  He stands there for a 
     beat.  Then he sits beside Holden.  He opens his arms.  
     Holden shifts into his friend's embrace and begins crying 
     on his shoulder.  Banky pats his back.  Pull back on a 
     man in pain and the comfort of a friend.



     INT DINER - NIGHT

     Holden sits alone at a booth.  He stirs his iced tea.

                         OC VOICE
               Yo, look at this morose mother fucker 
               here..

     Holden looks up.  JAY and SILENT BOB stand above him.

                         JAY
               Smells like somebody shit in his 
               cereal.

     Holden offers a half-smile.  The pair slide into the 
     booth.

                         HOLDEN
               What took you so long?

                         JAY
               We were at the mall.  You bring the 
               salad?

     Holden pulls an envelope out of his jacket and tosses it 
     to Jay.  Jay opens it and pulls out a thick wad of bills, 
     along with the latest issue of 'BLUNTMAN and CHRONIC.'

                         JAY
               Man, this likeness rights shit is more 
               profitable than selling smoke.

                         HOLDEN
               How'd a dirt merchant like you ever 
               learn about likeness rights?

                         JAY
                    (hands envelope to Silent 
                    Bob)
               We deal to a lot of lawyers.  Speaking 
               of which...
                    (pulls out a dime bag)
               Little signing bonus and shit!

                         HOLDEN
               I'll pass.  Take a look at the issue.

     Silent Bob thumbs through the comic.  Jay looks over his 
     shoulder, as he begins rolling a joint.

                         JAY
               Yeah.  When you gonna get some pussy 
               in that book, man!  Throw some super-
               villain in with big fucking tits that 
               shoot milk or something, and I just 
               drink her dry, bust some moves on 
               her...
                    (demonstrates)
               ...and then she has to fuck me.
                    (Silent Bob hits him)
               Fuck us.

                         HOLDEN
               I'll see what I can do.

     A WAITRESS joins them.

                         WAITRESS
               What can I get you.

                         HOLDEN
               Nothing, thanks.

                         JAY
               Yo Flo - tell Mel to whip me up a 
               toasted bagel and cream cheese.
                    (to Silent Bob)
               You want one too?
                    (Silent Bob nods)
               Make that two.  And kiss my grits.  
               Noonch.
                    (the Waitress leaves; to 
                    Holden)
               D'jever watch 'Alice'?  That show's 
               good as hell.
                    (continues rolling)
               So why the long face, Horse?  Banky on 
               the rag?

                         HOLDEN
               When is he not?  No - I'm just having 
               some girl trouble.

                         JAY
               Bitch pressing charges?  I get that a 
               lot.

                         HOLDEN
               No.  I'm just at a point where I don't 
               know what to do.

                         JAY
               Kick her to the curb.  Girls get to be 
               too much trouble, there's always the 
               'band of the hand'.

                         HOLDEN
               Can't do it, g.  I'm in love.

                         JAY
               Ah, there ain't no such thing.  You 
               gotta boil it all down to the 
               essentials.  It's like Cube says - 
               life ain't nothing but bitches and 
               money.

                         HOLDEN
               Just what I needed - advice from the 
               'hood

                         JAY
               Who is this girl?

                         HOLDEN
               I don't think you know her.

                         JAY
               Come on man - I'm people who know 
               people.

                         HOLDEN
               You sound like Barbra Streisand.

                         JAY
               That's 'cause I got this tubby bitch 
               playing her greatest hits tape in my 
               ear all the time.  You should see him: 
               she starts singing 'You Don't Bring Me 
               Flowers', this faggot starts crying 
               like a little girl with a skinned knee 
               and shit.  It's embarrassing.  I got 
               the only muscle in the world with a 
               weakness for ballads.
                    (to Silent Bob)
               You big fucking softie.
                    (to Holden)
               So what's this skirt's name!

                         HOLDEN
               I'm telling you, you don't know her.

                         JAY
               I ain't playing.  Tell me her name, 
               Mysterio.

                         HOLDEN
               Alyssa Jones.

                         JAY
               Finger Cuffs?

     Holden rubs his eyes.

                         JAY
               You're dating Finger Cuffs?  Wait a 
               minute I thought she was all gay and 
               shit!

                         HOLDEN
               She is.  Or was.  I don't know.

     The Waitress returns with the order.

                         JAY
               And you go out with her?  Shit, man - 
               you're a lucky dog.  She bring other 
               chicks to bed with you, get a little 
               of that filet o' fish sammich going 
               on?

     The Waitress stares wide-eyed and offended at Jay.

                         JAY
                    (off the Waitress' look)
               Yeah - you know what I'm talking 
               about, baby.
                    (Waitress  leaves;  to 
                    Holden)
               So - four tits, or what?

                         HOLDEN
               It's not like that.

                         JAY
               Well what's it like then?

                         HOLDEN
               Right now?
                    (beat)
               I don't know.  I love her.  But she 
               has a past

                         JAY
               I'll say.  Stuffin' two guys, eating 
               chicks out.  Yo - I heard one time, 
               she had this dog...

                         HOLDEN
               Eat your fucking bagel already!

                         JAY
                    (to Silent Bob)
               Look at this touchy mother fucker 
               right here.
                    (to Holden)
               So, if you're all in love with her, 
               what's the problem?

                         HOLDEN
               The problem is shit like that.  It was 
               one thing when it was just girls - 
               that was weird enough.  But now you 
               throw guys into the mix - two guys at 
               once, no less.  All that 
               experience...What am I supposed to 
               think?

                         JAY
               You think good; because now she'll be 
               all true blue and shit.  The girl's 
               tasted life, yo.  Now she's settlin' 
               for your boring, funny-book-makin' 
               ass.

                         HOLDEN
               Settling.  That's comforting, Jay.  
               Thanks.

                         JAY
               That's what I'm here for.

                         HOLDEN
               I'm lust having a problem with all of 
               it I can't get it out of my head these 
               visuals of her doing all this shit.  
               And I don't know why I can't let it 
               go.  Because I'm crazy about her, you 
               know?  I look at this girl, I see the 
               future.  I see kids.  I see grand-
               kids.

                         JAY
               You're scaring me.

                         HOLDEN
               I'm scaring myself.  Because I think 
               so much of her,  and then I can't get 
               over shit like 'Finger Cuffs'.
                    (shakes his head)
               I don't know what I'm doing.

     Holden looks out the window.  Jay continues to roll his 
     joint.  There's silence. Then...

                         BOB
               You're chasing Amy.

     Holden's head snaps forward.  He stares, wide-eyed at 
     Silent Bob.

                         HOLDEN
               What..what did you say?

                         BOB
               You're chasing Amy.

     Holden stares, shocked.  He looks to Jay, who's still 
     rolling his joint.

                         JAY
               What do you look so shocked for?  He 
               does this all the time.  Fat bastard 
               thinks just because he never says 
               anything, that it'll have some huge 
               impact when he does open his fucking 
               mouth.

                         BOB
               Why don't you shut up?  Jesus!  Always 
               yap, yap, yapping all the time.  Give 
               me a fucking headache.
                    (to Holden)
               I went through something like what 
               you're going through.  Years ago.  
               Same kind of thing with a girl named 
               Amy.

                         JAY
               When?

                         BOB
               A couple of years ago.

                         JAY
               What'd she 'Live in Canada' or 
               something?  Why don't I remember this?

                         BOB
               What you don't know about me I can 
               just about squeeze into the Grand 
               fucking Canyon.  Did you know I always 
               wanted to be a dancer in Vegas?

     Jay and Holden look at him.  Silent Bob busts a move with 
     his hands.

                         BOB
               Hunhh?  Bet you didn't know that?

                         JAY
               Just cell your fucking story so we can 
               get out of here and smoke this.

                         BOB
                    (to Holden)
               So there's me an Amy, and we're all 
               inseparable, right?  Just big time in 
               love.  And then about four months in, 
               I ask about the ex-boyfriend.  Dumb 
               move, I know, but you know how it is - 
               you don't really want to know, but you 
               just have to... stupid guy bullshit.  
               Anyway she starts telling me all about 
               him - how they dated for years, lived 
               together, her mother likes me better, 
               blah, blah, blah - and I'm okay.  But 
               then she tells me that a couple times, 
               he brought other people to bed with 
               them - menage a tois, I believe it's 
               called.  Now this just blows my mind.  
               I mean, I'm not used to that sort of 
               thing, right?  I was raised Catholic.

                         JAY
               Saint Shithead.

     Silent Bob backhands him.  Jay raises his fist as if to 
     strike.

                         BOB
               Do something.
                    (to Holden)
               So I get weirded out, and just start 
               blasting her, right?  This is the only 
               way I can deal with it - by calling 
               her a slut, and telling her that she 
               was used - I mean, I'm out for blood I 
               want to hurt her - because I don't 
               know how to deal with what I'm 
               feeling.  And I'm like "What the fuck 
               is wrong with you?"  and she's telling 
               me that it was that time, in that 
               place, and she didn't do anything 
               wrong, so she's not gonna apologize.  
               So I tell her it's over, and I walk.

                         JAY
               Fucking a.

                         BOB
               No, idiot.  It was a mistake.  I 
               wasn't disgusted with her, I was 
               afraid.  At that moment, I felt small - 
               like I'd lacked experience, like I'd 
               never be on her level or never be 
               enough for her or something.  
               And what I didn't get was that she 
               didn't care.  She wasn't looking for 
               that guy anymore.  She was looking for 
               me.  But by the time I realized this, 
               it was too late, you know.  She'd 
               moved on, and all I had to show for it 
               was some foolish pride, which then 
               gave way to regret.  She was the girl, 
               I know that now.  But I pushed her 
               away...

     Everyone's silent Silent Bob lights a cigarette.

                         BOB
               So I've spent every day since then 
               chasing Amy...
                    (takes a drag from his smoke)
               So to speak.

     They sit there for a beat.  Jay pockets the rest of his 
     dime-bag.

                         JAY
               Enough of this fucking melodrama.  My 
               advice - forget her, dude.  There's 
               one woman in the world.  One woman, 
               with many faces.
                    (to Silent Bob)
               Get up, bitch
                    (to Holden)
               We gotta book.  We're catching a bus 
               to Chi-town.

                         HOLDEN
               What's there?

                         JAY
               Business, yo.  How many more of those 
               phat envelopes do we got coming to us?

                         HOLDEN
               I don't know.  I don't know if the 
               book's going to be around much longer.

                         JAY
               Yeah?  Good.  I'll be glad as shit 
               when it's gone.

                         HOLDEN
               Are you kidding me?  There's millions 
               of people out there that'd love to see 
               themselves in a comic book.

                         JAY
               I know.  I spend every fucking waking 
               hour with one of them.  But it ain't 
               like us at all - all slapsticky and 
               shit - running around like dicks, 
               saying... What's that shit you got me 
               saying?

                         HOLDEN
               Snootchie-bootchies.

                         JAY
               'Snootchie-bootchies'.  Who talks like 
               that?  That's baby-talk.
                    (slaps his hand)
               It's a big world, g - but we're bound 
               to run into you again.  Until then - 
               keep your unit on you.

                         HOLDEN
               I'll try.

                         BOB
               Do, or do not - there is no ay.

                         JAY
                    (slaps him)
               Knock it off!  Get your fat ass moving 
               - we got a bus to catch.
                    (under his breath)
               Jedi-bitch.

     Exit Jay and Silent Bob.  Holden remains in the booth, 
     thinking.



     MONTAGE - AN UNCOMFORTABLE SILENCE

     1) Holden sits at his drawing table, tapping his pencil 
     up and down.

     2)Alyssa sits in a club, getting talked at by some women. 
     She's not present in the conversation.

     3) Banky meets with Sloss at a restaurant Sloss shakes 
     the contracts at him, and Banky makes the "I know, I 
     know," face.

     4) Holden stares at the picture Alyssa gave him.

     5) Alyssa with her ear to the phone.  She hangs up, 
     angrily.

     6) Holden sits in the park that he and Alyssa walked 
     through.  He's staring at Alyssa's yearbook picture.  He 
     closes the book and sighs.  Then, an idea hits him.  He 
     jumps up and dashes out of the park.



     INT STUDIO - NIGHT

     Banky and Alyssa sit on the couch.  Holden paces in front 
     of them.

                         HOLDEN
               I know you're wondering why I asked 
               you both here tonight, at the same 
               time, knowing that we have shit to 
               settle between us, separately.

                         BANKY
               I just figured you wanted to kill two 
               birds with one stone by telling her to 
               fuck off with me here so you didn't 
               have to go through the story again 
               later on.

                         ALYSSA
               Fuck you.

                         BANKY
               Not even if you let me videotape it.

                         HOLDEN
               Enough!
                    (they both look at him)
               I've been going through things, over 
               and over.  And I dissected it all, and 
               looked at it a thousand different 
               ways.  Banky - there's friction 
               between us for the first time in our 
               lives.  You hate me dating Alyssa and 
               you want me to sign off on this M-TV 
               thing.

                         BANKY
               How perceptive.

                         HOLDEN
               Alyssa - you and I hit a wall, because 
               I don't know how to deal with... your 
               past, I guess.

                         BANKY
               That's a nice way of putting it.  I'd 
               have said the whole double-stuff 
               thing...

                         HOLDEN
                    (right in his face)
               I'm only going to say it once: shut 
               up.
                    (back to pacing)
               Now - I know I'm to blame one way or 
               the other on both accounts.  With you, 
               Alyssa - it's my fault because I feel 
               inadequate.  Because you've had so 
               much experience, had such a big life; 
               and my life's been pretty small in 
               comparison.

                         ALYSSA
               That doesn't matter to me...

                         HOLDEN
               Please.  I have to get through this.
                    (beat)
               And with you Banky - I know why you're 
               having such a hard time with Alyssa, 
               and it's something that's been obvious 
               forever, but I guess I just didn't 
               acknowledge it.
                    (takes a deep breath)
               You're in love with me.

                         BANKY
                    (makes a face; beat)
               What?

                         HOLDEN
               You're attracted to me.  Just as, in a 
               way, I'm attracted to you.  I mean, it 
               makes sense - we've been together so 
               long, we have so much in common...

                         BANKY
                    (getting up)
               Well, I've got to get home and catch 
               the last few minutes of 'Babylon 5', 
               so I'll be...

     Holden grabs him, kisses him full on the lips, and pushes 
     him back onto the couch Alyssa reacts.  Banky - wide-eyed 
     and speechless - looks away.

                         HOLDEN
               It's something you're going to have to 
               deal with.  Bank.  You may very well 
               be gay, which explains your homophobia 
               and why you're so jealous of Alyssa, 
               and your sense of humor as well.

                         BANKY
               Just 'cause a guy's got a predilection 
               coward dick jokes...

                         HOLDEN
               Bank.  Stop.  Deal with it.  You'll 
               feel much better.

     He grabs a chair from the side of the room.

                         HOLDEN
               Now - at this point, you may be asking 
               yourself the question that I've been 
               going over and over in my head for the 
               last few days: what does one have to 
               do with the other?

     Alyssa's face drops.  She subtly shakes her head.

                         ALYSSA
                    (under her breath)
               Don't.

                         HOLDEN
               And when I did some serious soul-
               searching, it came at me from out of 
               nowhere, and suddenly it all made 
               sense - a calm came over me.  I know 
               what we have to do.  And then you - 
               Bank, you Alyssa, and I - all of us... 
               can finally be... alright.

                         ALYSSA
                    (again, under her breath)
               Please don't say it.

                         HOLDEN
                    (sits in the chair; takes a 
                    long beat)
               We've all got to have sex together.

     The room is silent.  Holden Lights a cigarette.  Banky's 
     eyes nearly bug.   Alyssa's  head drops.

                         HOLDEN
               Don't you see?  That would take care 
               of everything.  Alyssa - I wouldn't 
               feel inadequate or too conservative 
               anymore.  I'll have done something on 
               par with all the experience you've 
               had.  And it'll be with you, which'll 
               make it that much more powerful.  And 
               Banky - you can cake that leap that 
               everyone else but you sees that you 
               should take.  And it'll be okay, 
               because it'll be with me - your best 
               friend for years.  We've been 
               everything to each other but 
               intimates.  And now, we'll have been 
               through that together too.  And it 
               won't have to be a total leap for you, 
               because a woman will be involved.  And 
               when it's over, all that aggression 
               you feel toward Alyssa will be gone.  
               Because you'll have shared in 
               something beautiful with the woman I 
               love.  It'll be cathartic.  A true 
               communion.  We have to do this.  For 
               me, for both of you... for all of our 
               sakes.  This will keep us together.
                    (beat)
               What do you say?

     Banky stares forward, wide-eyed.  He leans back into the 
     couch and lets out a huge sigh.  Then shrugs.

                         BANKY
               Sure.

     Holden smiles at his friend.  Then he looks at Alyssa.

                         HOLDEN
               You know I need this.  You know it'll 
               help.

     Alyssa looks at him, sadly.

                         ALYSSA
               No.

     Holden reacts, shocked Banky lets out a sigh of relief.

                         HOLDEN
               No?  I... I thought you'd be into 
               this.

                         ALYSSA
               You did?  What does that say about me?

                         HOLDEN
               But you've... you've done... stuff... 
               like this.  This should be no big deal 
               for you.

                         ALYSSA
               You don't want this.
                    (lights her cigarette)
               You really don't want this.  Trust me.

                         HOLDEN
               I need this.  This has to happen.  Why 
               can't you see that?  And how can you 
               not?  What does that say about me?  
               You can take it from two guys whose 
               names you can barely remember, but I 
               ask you to share an experience like it 
               - where it's about intimacy - and you 
               say no?

                         ALYSSA
                    (inhales from her cigarette, 
                    takes a beat)
               I can't.

     Holden moves to her side of the couch.

                         HOLDEN
               You can.  I'll be there.  And when 
               it's over, we'll be the strongest 
               we've ever been because we got through 
               some nasty shit together.  And we'll 
               finally be on the same level together.  
               And then there'll be nothing we can't 
               accomplish.

     A tear rolls down her cheek She looks at him, sadly, and 
     touches his face.

                         ALYSSA
               Oh Holden.
                    (trying to compose herself)
               That time is over for me.  I've been 
               there.  I've done it.  And I didn't 
               find what I was looking for in any of 
               it.  I found that in you - in us.  
               Doing this won't help you forget about 
               the things you're hung up on.  It'll 
               create more.

                         HOLDEN
               No it won't.  I thought about all of 
               that.

                         ALYSSA
               No, it will.  Maybe you'll see me 
               differently from then on - maybe 
               you'll despise me for going along with 
               it, once you're in the moment.  Maybe 
               I'll moan differently and then you'll 
               resent Banky, and become suspicious of 
               us.  Or you'll alienate him because of 
               it, and then grow to blame and hate me 
               for the deterioration of your 
               friendship.  Or what if- I sincerely 
               doubt it, but what if - I saw 
               something in Banky that I never saw 
               before, and fell in love with him and 
               left you.  I've been down roads like 
               this before; many times.  I know you 
               feel doing this will broaden your 
               horizons and give you experience.  But 
               I've had those experiences on my own.  
               I can't accompany you on your's.  I'm 
               past that now.
                    (touches his face; stares to 
                    cry)
               Or maybe I just love you too much.  
               And I feel hurt and let down that 
               you'd want to share me with anyone.  
               Because I never wanted to share you
                    (holds it in; gets up)
               Regardless I can't be a part of this.
                    (beat)
               Or you.  Not anymore
                    (hugs him)
               I love you.  I always will.  Know 
               that.

     She releases him, then slaps him.

                         ALYSSA
               But I'm not your fucking whore.

     Alyssa storms away, stopping briefly to look Banky up and 
     down.

                         ALYSSA
               He's your's again.

     She walks our of the studio.  The door closes behind her.

     Banky and Holden stand there, silently.  Cut to black.

     INT COMIC BOOK SHOW - DAY

     It's ONE YEAR later.  We're at another show, not unlike 
     the one from the opening.

     A copy of 'Bluntman and Chronic' enters the frame.  The 
     cover reads 'The Death Chronic', complete with a 
     corresponding drawing.

                         BANKY V.O.
               Blast from the past.

     Banky sits at his own signing table.  Behind him hangs a 
     banner that reads 'BANKY EDWARDS - CREATOR Of BABY DAVE'.  
     A small line is formed in front of him.  He talks with a 
     FAN.

                         FAN
               Do you know how much it's going for 
               these days?  One ten.  You signing it 
               will push that up even higher,

                         BANKY
               If you sell it, I want a kickback
                    (starts signing)

                         FAN
               I don't know if this is true, but I 
               heard once that there was going to be 
               an animated series.

                         BANKY
               There was going to be

                         FAN
               What happened!

                         BANKY
                    (off comic)
               You're looking at it.  No Chronic - no 
               cartoon

                         FAN
               That sucks man.  That would've been 
               awesome.

                         BANKY
               Tell me about it

                         FAN
               Is that what happened to you and 
               Holden McNeil?  You got into a fight 
               over the rights or something?

                         BANKY
               It was a little more involved than 
               that.

                         FAN
               Whatever happened to him?

                         BANKY
               He quit the biz.  I guess.

                         FAN
               You guys don't talk anymore?

                         BANKY
                    (looks OC)
               No.  Not really.

     Banky locks eyes with someone OC.  His expression 
     softens.

     Holden leans against a wall on the far side of the room.  
     He smiles at Banky.  Banky smiles back, and sort of nods.

     Holden holds up a copy of Banky's new solo comic.  He 
     points to it and gives a thumbs up.

                         OC FAN
               Probably shouldn't have killed off 
               Chronic.

     Banky smiles to OC.

                         BANKY
               Guess not.  Some doors just shouldn't 
               be opened.

     Banky looks in another direction, OC.  He looks at Holden 
     and points to it.   Holden looks in the same direction, 
     and then looks back at Banky and nods.

                         OC FAN
               You don't need that guy, anyway.  You 
               do great stuff without him.

     Banky looks at Holden for a beat.  Then he brings his 
     pointer fingers together,  mimicing Holden's 'shared 
     moment' gesture.

     Holden shrugs slightly, then crosses his fingers - as if 
     to say 'hopefully'.

                         OC FAN
               You were just carrying that guy, 
               anyway.

     Banky sort of smiles at the OC Holden.  Then he offers 
     his own thumbs up - as to say 'good luck'.

                         BANKY
                    (to fan, still looking OC)
               You're so right.

     Holden smiles back, nods 'bye', and walks off.

                         OC FAN
               Well, keep up the good work, man.  
               Love them dick jokes.  Love 'em.  See 
               ya.

     The Fan Leaves, but Banky is watching Holden go.

                         BXVKY
               Yeah.  Bye.
                    (shakes it off)
               Okay.  Who's next?

     Alyssa sits at a separate signing table, with a line in 
     front of her.  A WOMAN behind her.  Alyssa dashes off 
     signatures in the copies of her comic.

                         ALYSSA
                    (to OC departing fan)
               Thanks for reading it.

     The Woman stands and rubs her shoulders.

                         WOMAN
               I'm going to get a soda.  You want 
               anything?

                         ALYSSA
               I'm fine, thanks,

     The Woman heads off.  Alyssa starts rummaging through her 
     bag.

                         ALYSSA
                    (not rooking up)
               Okay, who's next!

     A comic book drops on the table in front of her.   It's a 
     comic book called 'Chasing Amy'.

     She leafs through it, not looking up.

                         ALYSSA
               Um... This isn't one of mine.

                         OC HOLDEN
               It's mine.

     Alyssa looks up sharply.

     Holden stands before her, smiling.

                         HOLDEN
               I saved you one.

                         ALYSSA
               Hi.

                         HOLDEN
               Hi.

                         ALYSSA
                    (beat)
               How've you been?

                         HOLDEN
               Good.  Really good.  Yourself?

                         ALYSSA
               Good
                    (beat; off her own comic)
               New issue's selling like crazy, for 
               some reason.

                         HOLDEN
               Because it's so good.  I really liked 
               it.

                         ALYSSA
               Thank you.
                    (off comic)
               I haven't even seen this yet.  Did it 
               just come out?

                         HOLDEN
               A month ago.  I did a really small 
               run.  Self-financed.  Only about five 
               hundred issues.

                         ALYSSA
               Will I enjoy it?
                         HOLDEN
               You might.  It's familiar subject 
               matter.

     Alyssa leafs through it.  Her eyes get somewhat misty.

                         ALYSSA
               Looks Like a very personal story.

                         HOLDEN
               I finally had something personal to 
               say.

     They look at each other for a beat

                         HOLDEN
               I'm going to go.  I don't want to hold 
               up the line.

                         ALYSSA
               Yeah.  I mean, it can get ugly.  I 
               just saw this nun in line call this 
               small child a cunt-rag.

                         HOLDEN
                    (smiles)
               Read that, when you have a minute

                         ALYSSA
               I will.

                         HOLDEN
               I'd like to hear your thoughts about 
               it.  If you get a chance, give me a 
               call.

                         ALYSSA
               Okay.

     They look at each other for a beat.

                         HOLDEN
               Nice seeing you again,

                         ALYSSA
               Really nice to see you too.

     He walks away.  A few steps away, he turns and waves 
     again.  She waves back.  And then he starts moving 
     through the thrall of fan-boys.

     The Woman returns with coffee.  She follows Alyssa's 
     gaze.

                         WOMAN
               who was that?

                         ALYSSA
