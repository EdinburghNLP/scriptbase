           The rumors of my promiscuity have
           been greatly exaggerated.

          OLIVE PENDERGHAST (17), a cute teenager, speaks directly into
          the WEBCAM atop her computer.

           Let the record show that I, Olive
           Penderghast, being of sound mind,
           ample breast size and the
           occasional corny knock knock joke,
           do enter this video blog into
           evidence in the case against me.
           Because I'm being judged by a jury
           of my peers, I will attempt to
           insert `like' and `totally' into my
           confession as much as possible. So
           here it goes... I confess I'm, in
           no small part, to blame for the
           vociferous gossip that has turned
           my Varsity letter scarlet, but -
           for anyone hoping that the sizzling
           details of my sordid past will
           provide you with a reason to lock
           the door and make love to a dollop
           of your sister's moisturizing
           lotion - you'll be gravely
           disappointed.

           Look, I just need to set the record
           straight and what better way to do
           that, than to broadcast it on the
           Internet. So, here it is -- Part
           One: The Shudder-Inducing and
           Cliched, However Totally False

           you're supposed to stick your

           I think it's just practice. For

          quickly on the cheek and darts from the closet.
                         
          Olive sits in the closet for a moment, contemplating what
          just happened, wondering if he was telling the truth, then
          she opens the door.
                         
          The coast is clear, except for ANOTHER PRETEEN KID walking

          Olive half-listens in class, while her English teacher MR.
          GRIFFIN (early 30's), a handsome guy, lectures on `THE
          SCARLET LETTER.'
                         
           OLIVE (V.O.)
           So, I'm feeling like the cat's ass,
           because everyone thinks I've been
           deflowered. I'm surprised at how
           empowered I felt by this
           prevarication. I wonder to myself,
           would I feel this invigorated if I
           had actually let some college kid
           violate me in his cockroach-
           infested dorm room? Probably not.
           (Beat.)
           Ironically, we were studying `The
           Scarlet Letter,' but isn't that
           always the way with these teenage
           tales? The literature you read in
           class always seems to have a strong
           connection with whatever angsty
           adolescent drama is being
           recounted. I consider this.
           (Pause.)
           Then I think: Except for
           `Huckleberry Finn.' I don't know
           any teenage boys who have ever run
           away with a big, hulking black guy.

          racier and is starting to look pretty hot.

          seen by Olive leaving Gibbons's office the day before.
                         
          The bullied kid is thin as a rail, pale as a ghost and
          slightly effeminate. He looks miserable. Not just by this
          detention, but from life in general.

           Brandon was in the middle of

           there a quiet room we can go to

          She spins around to the entire party, who is looking at them

          conspiratorially.
                         
          Olive plops down on the bed and stretches out. Brandon lays
          beside her. She moans for the benefit of the audience she
          knows has assembled outside. She moans again and it's very
          convincing.

          Sure enough, it seems as if most of the party is listening at
          the door - falling all over each other to hear. Nearest to
          the door is the bully, who is pleasantly surprised by the

          Olive reaches into her handbag and pulls out her copy of `The
          Scarlet Letter' and reads it while she makes sex noises.
          Brandon laughs at this and Olive smacks him with it,
          prompting him to stop. She puts her finger over her lips,
          giving him the `Shhhh' sign.
                         
          She continues to read as she thrusts her hips, making the bed

          crescendoing her moaning like a pro.

          The bully immediately hands Brandon a beer and throws his arm
          around him, leading him drunkenly down the hallway, with a
          crew of guys after the dirty details.
                         
          Olive looks at this and smiles, satisfied. Then she realizes
          that, though the guys have gone, there are a whole slew of
          girls looking at her completely differently. They avoid her
          eye contact, as one would ward off Medusa.

          leaning against the counter, signalling `NO, DON'T DO IT' to
          him behind her back.
                         
          She spins around and they instantly pretend to not be paying

           Cindy Mancini gets $1,000. I get a
           vibrator and a $200 Gift Card to
           Target.

           Dear Olive, The dildo is just in
           case you don't shop at Target.
           Then you can fuck yourself.
                         
          Olive breaks out into riotous laughter. She's genuinely
          touched by this gift.
                         
          The phone rings. Thinking it's Brandon, Olive snatches it

           picks up the phone and magically
           seems to know who's going to be on
           the other end. I usually preface a
           conversation with `hello' to avoid
           such banalities. The one time I

          Rhiannon, clutching an enormous Diet Coke, plods through the

           Evan, if you're watching this -
           shame on you. I hope you never
           treat another girl the way you
           treated me or you will die alone,
           wishing it was because you're fat.
           And since we're playing the shame
           game... While I appreciate the
           sentiment, Lewis, a pretend hand
           job should have warranted a little
           more than a hundred dollars worth
           of AMC Movie Passes. They had an
           expiration date AND were only able
           to be used for movies that had been
           running for two weeks. But even
           that's better than Tyler Jennings,
           who gave me a ten percent off
           coupon to Bath and Body Works.
           Seriously. A fucking coupon. Is
           that how good my imaginary blow job
           was to you? Huh? Is chivalry
           dead? I want John Cusack holding a
           boombox outside my window. I want
           Richard Gere climbing up my fire
           escape with the limo waiting
           downstairs. I want to ride off on
           a lawnmower with Patrick Dempsey.
           Although, I'm ashamed to admit I'd
           prefer him to look like he looks
           now. What woman wouldn't? But no.
           I get to save two fifty on a bottle
           of Juniper Breeze Hand Lotion.
           Maybe chivalry isn't dead, but it's
           in a coma and the prognosis isn't
           good.

          Her boyfriend, MICAH (17) takes her hand and holds it. She

          sympathetically.

           really good friends. I was really
           starting to think that things were
           going to turn around.

          Marianne, angry as hell, stomps through the hall with hatred
          burning in her eyes and coursing through her veins.
                         
           OLIVE (V.O.)
           But then I unwittingly gave her
           boyfriend a venerial disease...
                         
          Marianne stops in front of Olive and slaps her so hard that
          people in the hallways stop, dead in their tracks.
                         
          It's the slap heard `round the school.

          Olive bursts into Mrs. Griffin's office. Tear-streaked, Mrs.
          Griffin is packing her things into a cardboard box. It's as
          if her world has just collapsed.

          Olive starts to say something, but Mrs. Griffin can't even
          look at her.
                         
           MRS. GRIFFIN (CONT'D)

          She throws a framed photo of her and Mr. Griffin into the
          box. It shatters. Mrs. Griffin falls apart.
                         
          Olive starts to say something again, but she doesn't know
          what to say, so she sheepishly turns to leave.

           The funny thing is: the whole time

           calling me something I knew wasn't
           true, my best friend included - I
           couldn't help but think how I could
           have come up with better signs. No
           one even bothered to use
           alliteration or, God forbid, irony -
           not even a single acronym - and
           that seems a lot more unforgivable

          Olive enters a Catholic Church. It's empty, but there are a
          few CANDLES burning. She sees the CONFESSIONAL BOOTH and
          makes a beeline toward it.
                         
          She takes a deep breath and enters.

           Forgive me, father, for I have
           sinned. I think that's how you're
           supposed to start these things.
           I'm only going on what I've seen in
           the movies. Then, I think I'm
           supposed to tell you how long it's
           been since my last confession, but
           that's kind of my first confession.
           I'm not Catholic. I really don't
           know what I'm supposed to do,
           except sit here in this booth and
           tell you what I've done wrong.
           Where do I even start?
           (Beat.)
           I've been pretending to be a -- how
           would one phrase it in Catholic
           words? A harlot. It's not like
           I've actually been doing the things
           that people are saying I'm doing,
           but - then again - I'm not denying
           them, so I've just been wondering:
           is that wrong? There's a lot of
           shi -- `crap' going down at my
           school which may or may not be
           indirectly because of this
           masquerade.
           (Beat.)
           I'm lying. I may have caused the
           end of a marriage. I thought, in
           my own perverse way, that I could
           help it. I mean, in my defense, I
           am merely an adolescent. I should
           never have been propositioned in
           the way I was propositioned by an
           adult. But then again, I should
           never have consented. It was just
           that a lot of people had been
           asking me to do things and I
           thought it was okay, because it
           wasn't real.

          There's a long silence. Olive tears up and wipes them away.
                         
                          OLIVE (CONT'D)
           I could be wrong, but aren't you

           questions. Tell me to say `Hail
           Marys'? Hello?

          Marianne looks back and Olive gives her the thumbs up.
                         
          Across the room, Rhi sees this exchange and sneers.

          Marianne is working with her partner, Evan. She turns to
          Olive behind them and makes a gagging signal behind his back
          and laughs silently.

           had private jokes.
                         
          Olive, unaware of how to respond, gives another thumbs up.

          over to Olive and again throws her arms around her.

           Micah's in the hospital. He's in

           know what was wrong.
                         
          Olive just holds her new friend, as she had the day before.

          Marianne's boyfriend, Micah, writhes in pain on a hospital
          bed, clutching his crotch. His worried MOTHER (40's) is
          beside him, clutching her chest with one hand and trying to
          soothe him with the other.

          both of her hands and begins slapping him, uncontrollably.

           me! TELL ME!
                         
          Micah, in pain from the burning sensation and his mother's
          hands flying at astonishing speed shouts out:

          disgusted grimace.
                         
          She picks up the phone and dials a number. She is,
          animatedly, talking to the person on the other end of the

          Marianne clutches the phone in the cradle with enough force
          that it looks like the receiver will shatter in her hands.
          Mrs. Griffin looks worried.

          Like a teapot about to start expelling steam, Marianne
          quivers in rage. Finally, at boiling point, she shouts --
                         
                          MARIANNE

          ringing of the school bell. Mrs. Griffin is taken aback by

          Marianne stops in front of Olive and slaps her so hard that
          people in the hallways stop, dead in their tracks.

          She throws a framed photo of her and Mr. Griffin into the
          box. It shatters. Mrs. Griffin falls apart.
                         
          Olive starts to say something again, but she doesn't know
          what to say, so she sheepishly turns to leave --
                         
          -- and then feels awkward.

           My guidance counselor, who had only
           days before armed me with a latex
           bulletproof vest, told me that she
           had chlamydia and that she had been
           screwing around with her office
           aide's boyfriend under the guise of
           divorce counseling. She confided
           in me that she and her husband - my
           favorite teacher - were having
           marital problems, that they hadn't
           slept together in months. She
           assured me that she had never meant
           for anything to happen with Micah.
           She confessed to me how when she
           was a child she always dreamt of
           being Maria Von Trapp, not Mary Kay
           Letorneau. Micah had panicked and
           used me as a scapegoat - to save
           her job and her marriage. She
           assured me that she would make sure
           everyone knew the truth and
           apologized.

          Olive gives her a reassuring smile, steps up to the plate and
          offers up a solution.

           Tell him I still remember that.
           But tell him that I confessed to
           giving him chlamydia.
                         
          Mrs. Griffin grabs Olive and cries on her.
                         
                          OLIVE (CONT'D)
           And it's not really my place to say
           this, but I figure after the
           conversation we just had, I can
           speak candidly. Your husband is
           HOT and while the male adolescent
           can fuck like a bunny... who really
           wants to fuck a bunny? If I was
           you, I'd go home and seduce him and
           pretend this never happened.
                         
          Olive strokes her guidance counselor's hair.

           No, you keep them.
                         
          She strokes her hair.

           Dude, if some bimbo gave MY
           boyfriend an STD, I'd have swung,
           but I'd have balled my fist.
                          (WHIMSICALLY)
           My boyfriend.
           (She gets lost in the
                          THOUGHT)
           With all the mythical play I was
           getting, it's a wonder - and
           probably a miracle - that I still
           hadn't actually been asked out on a
           real date. Guys were clamoring to
           claim that they'd slept with me,
           but no one was putting the real
           moves on me. Until finally...
                         
                         
          EXT. PLAYGROUND - YEARS BEFORE
                         
          Two LITTLE 5 YEAR OLD GIRLS (Olive and Rhiannon) chase a
          LITTLE BOY all over the playground, desperate to kiss him.
                         
          They plot and plan to corner him, but he's just too fast.
                         
           OLIVE (V.O.)
           It was really Rhiannon who had a
           crush on him. She has since we
           were kids.
                         
          Rhiannon finally catches him and kiss him on the cheek.
          Repulsed, he wipes his face.
                         
          Rhiannon and Olive high five each other.
                         
                         
          INT. CAFETERIA - DAY
                         
          Olive eats her lunch and yuks it up with a table full of
          guys. Rhiannon sits at a different table, mostly comprised
          of girls, and glares at her from across the room.
                         
          The bell rings and the students begin getting up and making
          their way toward the exit.
                         
          Anson (who we saw earlier with Rhiannon in the hallways)
          approaches Olive.
                         
                          ANSON
           Hey Olive.

                          ANSON
           I dunno. I was thinking about
           chartering a hot air balloon,
           taking along a bottle of champagne
           and fresh fruit and then trying to
           impress you with an overzealous

          Olive and Anson sit in a booth at a dimly-lit RED LOBSTER.
          Olive looks beautiful. The `A' on her shirt is sequined.
                         
                          OLIVE
           I can't believe you brought me to
           the nicest restaurant in town.
           This is swank. I was beginning to
           think that there was no such thing
           as class.
                         
                          ANSON
           Yeah. What's better than getting
           to select your dinner and have nice
           conversation while they boil it
           alive in the back?

           I think Anson Jr. doesn't mind
           making the sacrifice. You don't
           mind that I named him Anson Jr., do
           you?
                         
                          ANSON
           Not at all. I'm actually kind of
           honored.
                         
                          OLIVE
           Do you believe this whole thing
           about lobster being an aphrodisiac?

           Y'know, medical science has not
           substantiated claims that any
           particular food increases sexual
           desire or performance. It's so
           funny when guys ply women with food
           that they think is gonna get them
           laid. I mean, what's really sexy
           about slurping back oysters? You
           know, native people believed that
           you gained the strength of the
           animal by consuming it. Some
           people grind up rhinoceros horn,
           because it's thought to stiffen the
           male sex organ. It's all bullshit.
           And spanish fly? It's pulverized
           beetle that people eat! Although,
           it's illegal for human consumption
           in the United States and do you
           know why? Because if you take just
           a bit too much, it causes painful
           urination, fever and bloody
           discharge.
                         
          A SERVER appears with their LOBSTER. Anson is an odd shade
          of green from Olive's little science lesson.
                         
                          OLIVE (CONT'D)
           Yum!
                         
          The server leaves them and Olive digs in. Anson is feeling
          nauseous and can't touch his.
                         
          From across the restaurant, a PARADE OF SERVERS enters from
          the back, enthusiastically clapping and holding a cupcake.

           really likes you.

           She and I just don't have much in
           common.

           I think so. For instance, I, too
           think Nina Howell's a twat.

           Yeah, well, if that's our magical

           Haven't you?
                         
          Olive suddenly becomes self-conscious and a little bit
          pissed.
                         
                          ANSON (CONT'D)

          They duck out of the booth trying to keep their heads down,
          but Olive can't resist the urge to look up and see if
          Rhiannon sees them.
                         
          She does.
                         
          Olive and Rhiannon make eye contact. Whereas, Olive looks
          remorseful, Rhiannon looks like she's just been stabbed in
          the back -- which she has.
                         
          The Abernathys see her, as well, and wave. It's painfully
          obvious to Olive that Rhi hasn't told her parents about their
          differences. She starts to go over, but Rhiannon's face is
          turning vermillion in anger. Olive just waves, sheepishly
          and leaves with Anson.

          doesn't want to externalize it.
                         
          Anson puts his hand on her knee.
                         
                          ANSON
           I have something for you.
                         
          Olive manages a smile. He reaches into his pocket and pulls
          out a $500 GIFT CERTIFICATE to ANTHROPOLOGIE and hands it to
          her.
                         
          Olive is disappointed, but tries not to show it.

          He leans over and kisses her. She pushes him off.
                         
                          OLIVE
           Wait. This isn't how it works. I
           don't actually --
                         
          But he's kissing her again, a little too forcibly. She
          pushes him off again.
                         
                          OLIVE (CONT'D)

           think it would be kind of hot here.
                         
          He takes off his shirt.

          She gets out of the car. He rolls down the window.

          He drives off, leaving her outside in the parking lot.

          his car. He opens the door for her and she sits down.

          game.
                         
                          OLIVE
          That's disgusting! He's
          disgusting!
                         
                          ROSEMARY
          He wasn't back then. He was
          actually pretty handsome. All I'm
          saying is that MAYBE the reason
          that Bryant girl is going after you
          is because her mother told her
          about me.
                         
                          OLIVE
          So, the sins of the mother are
          revisited on the daughter.
                         
                          ROSEMARY
          There's something else you should
          know. This is hard to say but --
          Don Bryant is your father.
          Marianne is your sister.
           104.
                         
                         
          Olive turns white.
                         
                          ROSEMARY (CONT'D)
           Kidding!! Well, about the sister
           thing, but not about the Don thing.
           That happened. Actually that
           happened a couple of times before
           we got caught.
                         
          Olive punches her mother on the arm, who's laughing
          hysterically.
                         
                          OLIVE
           I hate you so much right now.
           Can't you see I'm a mess!
                         
                          ROSEMARY
           No, you're not, Olive. You're
           wonderful. And you're going to
           handle this the same way that I
           did. With an incontrovertible
           sense of humor.
                         
          They embrace and Olive gets an idea.
                         
                          OLIVE
           Thanks for the pep talk, Mom. Now
           get out. I need to make some phone
           calls.
                         
          Rosemary looks slightly concerned by the grin on Olive's
          face.
                         
                         
          INT. GYM - DAY
                         
          We join a pep rally, already in progress.
                         
          The DANCE TEAM attempts to rile up the school with a rousing
          rendition of Michael Jackson's `BAD.'
                         
          In the stands, Rhi sits with Marianne and Nina.
                         
                          MARIANNE
           So, Olive wasn't at school today.
                         
          She extends her palms to Nina and Rhi, who both slap them.
          Marianne puts her arm around Rhi.
                         
                          MARIANNE (CONT'D)
           I'm so glad you're with us now.
                         
                          RHIANNON
           Me too. You guys fucking rock.
           105.
                         
                         
                          MARIANNE
           We don't say that word, Rhiannon.
                         
                          NINA
                          (HELPFULLY)
           Just say `effing' instead. We
           effing rock.
                         
          Marianne nods in agreement, however Rhi is confused.
                         
                          RHIANNON
           But isn't that just implying the
           same word?
                         
                          MARIANNE
           Oh, Rhiannon. We have so much to
           teach you. It's okay to imply
           things.
                         
          Rhiannon looks at her new best friends, who just smile at
          her.
                         
          The song ends and there's a drum roll.
                         
                          RHIANNON
           Yay! It's time for Meerkat Todd.
                          (SEXUALLY)
           I just want to rip that costume off
           him and --
                         
          Marianne puts her hand firmly on Rhi's knee.
                         
                          MARIANNE
           Why don't you just not talk for a
           while, okay hon?
                         
          Rhi puts her head down.
                         
          The drum roll ends and Meerkat Todd bounces out in costume.
          He jumps around enthusing the student body --
                         
          But then he goes out of the gym and reenters pushing a
          DUMPSTER.
                         
          The familiar chords of the James Bond theme `Nobody Does It
          Better' plays from the band.
                         
          Meerkat Todd opens the lid of the dumpster and Olive, dressed
          in a glittery and slinky RED DRESS, with a BOA draped around
          her bare shoulder, pops up and croons with a handheld mic and
          slightly different lyrics:
           106.
                         
                         
                          OLIVE
           Nobody does it better.
           Makes me feel sad for the rest.
           Nobody does it half as good as me.
           Baby, I'm the best.
                         
          Todd lifts Olive out of the dumpster and she sings her ass
          off - and she's quite good.
                         
                          OLIVE (CONT'D)
           I wasn't lookin,'
           But somehow they found me.
           I tried to hide from
           Your love light.
           But like heaven above me
           The guys who loved me
           Are keepin' all my secrets safe
           tonight.
                         
          She winks at the audience. The guys begin to wolf whistle
          and howl at her sheer brilliance.
                         
          She begins to rub her hands seductively over Meerkat Todd's
          furry costume, eventually unzipping it and taking off the
          head to reveal:
                         
          BLUE DEVIL TODD! The crowd goes wild.
                         
                          OLIVE (CONT'D)
           And nobody does it better
           Though sometimes I wish someone
           could.
           Nobody does it quite the way I do.
           Why'd I have to be so good?
                         
          She saunters over to Rhi and kisses her on the cheek, leaving
          a big, red lip mark.
                         
                          OLIVE (CONT'D)
           The way that they hold me
           Whenever they hold me
           There's some kind of magic inside
           you.
           That keeps me from runnin',
           But just keep it comin'!
           How'd you learn to do the things
           you do?
                         
          She sees that Gibbons is not amused, but that doesn't stop
          her.
                         
                          OLIVE (CONT'D)
           Oh, and nobody does it better.
           Makes me feel sad for the rest.

          She walks over to a couple of HORN PLAYERS, and runs her
          fingers seductively over their (uh) instruments.
                         
          The crowd goes wild - some appalled, but most enthused.
                         
          Olive sashays through the crowd as the MALE TEENS scream and
          stuff money down her bodice.
                         
                          OLIVE (CONT'D)

           Baby, you're the best!
                         
          The song ends and Olive takes Blue Devil Todd's hand.

           the main event log on to
           www.freeolivep.com tonight at 6
           p.m. Now, I know this conflicts
           with tonight's basketball game, but
           c'mon would you rather be here
           cheering on the Meerkats
           (Looking at Todd,
                          LASCIVIOUSLY)
           or watch me do one.
                         
          There are audible gasps, but excitement nonetheless.
                         
          Gibbons angrily storms over and takes the microphone.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL GIBBONS

           Yeah, I can't. I'm gonna go bang
           my boyfriend while the whole school
           watches. But good luck with the
           game-thing. Go Meerkats.
                         
          She plods out, triumphantly.
                         
                         
          INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - DUSK
                         
          The sun is setting as Olive speaks into her webcam. But this
          time, we're not seeing it through the lens, but from a
          different point in the room.
           108.
                         
                         
                          OLIVE
           And here you all are. Waiting
           outside the closet door for me to
           kiss Todd, listening to me pretend
           to have sex with Brandon, paying me
           to lie for you, calling probably
           the last virgin in school a whore.
           Guys. Seriously.
                         
          All of a sudden -- from outside and downstairs --
                         
          James' `LAID' begins to play.
                         
          Olive goes over to the window and sees Todd below, holding up
          a BOOMBOX (a la John Cusack) and there's a RIDE-ON LAWN MOWER
          (a la Patrick Dempsey) behind him.
                         
          Upon seeing this, she bursts into laughter, but it couldn't
          be more romantic.

           song?

                          (SHOUTING UP)
           I guessed.
                         
                          OLIVE
           I see you've been watching my live
           webcast. It's still going on, you
           know.
                         
                          MEERKAT TODD
           Fuck them. They've had enough of
           you. Well, figuratively speaking.
           I borrowed my neighbor's John
           Deere. Come down here.
                         
                          OLIVE
           That rhymed.
                         
                          MEERKAT TODD
           Intentionally.
                         
                          OLIVE
           Be right down.
                         
          Olive can't get the smile off of her face as she goes back to
          the camera.
                         
          We see her through the lens.
           109.
                         
                         
                          OLIVE (CONT'D)
           That's Todd. Not that I owe any of
           you any more confessions, but I'm
           really in love with him. And I am
           going to lose my virginity to him.
           I'm not sure when. It could happen
           five minutes from now or tonight or
           six months from now or maybe on our
           wedding night, but the really
           amazing thing is that it's nobody's
           business.
           (As an afterthought)
           Like, totally.
                         
          She turns the camera off.

          Olive runs out of the house and tackles him, kissing him -
                         
          in the front yard,
                         
          in broad daylight,
                         
          for the world to see.
                         
           FADE OUT.

          We see, from the perspective of their computer screens,
          various reactions to Olive's webcast --
                         
          -- A proud Brandon watches from a hotel room. A MUSCULAR
          BLACK GUY in a towel comes up behind him and kisses his neck.
