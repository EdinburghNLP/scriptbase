<b>                                  FRIGHT NIGHT
</b>


                                   Written by

                                   Marti Noxon



<b>          EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD -- NIGHT
</b>

<b>                         FADE UP:
</b>          Moving through a tract development. The houses are like
          Mexican food -- the basic elements are all the same, just
          mixed differently.
          A gloomy night, no moon. And a slightly ominous pattern
          emerges...
          Green, thriving lawns and meticulously tended homes abut
          brown yards and porches littered with old newspapers and
          pizza joint flyers.
          Each third or fourth house is FOR SALE or, worse, seemingly
          abandoned. This area is in danger of becoming a ghost town.
          A deep, commanding voice pierces the silence:

<b>          VOICE (O.S.)
</b>          Defy reason. Defy everything you
          know.
          Now we move in on one of the homes. Not the nicest on the
          block, but inhabited. Lights on in the windows.

<b>          INT. SUBURBAN HOME/VARIOUS -- NIGHT
</b>
          Inside the house. A middle-class family lives here. The
          living room is empty, but the TV's on.

<b>          ON THE TELEVISION
</b>          A commercial for PETER VINCENT. A Las Vegas institution,
          he's a magician whose show is all Gothic, horror-movie
          imagery.
          Peter's wiry, hot -- a rock and roll bad boy. He's cutting a
          girl up with a chain saw. And grinning like a mad man.

<b>                         TELEVISION ANNOUNCER
</b>          Peter Vincent's "FRIGHT NIGHT."
          The family DOG is up on the coffee table eating what's left
          of a fast food burger and fries, still in the box.

<b>          TELEVISION ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
</b>          Something's moving in the dark.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          2.
</b>          Also on the table -- a role-playing game in progress.
          "Magic, the Gathering"... Elves and Wizards.

<b>          TELEVISION ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
</b>          Only at The Hard Rock. Nightly
          Wednesday Through Sunday.
          Now we hear what at first sounds like a MUFFLED ARGUMENT
          coming from another room.

<b>                         DISTANT VOICE
</b>          Get off her!!
          More voices yelling, something being thrown. An ugly
          domestic scene.
          We creep down a dark hall toward a cracked door, light seeps
          through the opening -- it SLAMS OPEN and ADAM, 17, crashes
          toward us.
          He's nice-looking, a little nerdy -- and he's in a blind
          terror.
          We get a glimpse of the horrible scene behind the door. A
          teen girl's room -- the sound of flesh ripping.
          We see a pale arm on the ground, shaking violently, as if
          something is tearing and tugging at the body attached to it.
          We bolt away with ADAM, who we now see is blood splattered,
          as he races UPSTAIRS. A PHONE CRADLE is ripped out of the
          wall, which Adam nearly falls over.

<b>          INT. SUBURBAN HOME -- UPPER LANDING/BEDROOM -- NIGHT
</b>
          ADAM RACES INTO HIS PARENTS' ROOM. Another horrible glimpse -
          - his mother's body splayed across her frilly bed.
          Blood on pale pink sheets.
          ADAM goes to his FATHER'S SIDE OF THE BED and now we see
          Adam's father's body. His father was reaching for A GUN he'd
          hidden under the bed.
          ADAM gets down under the bed, desperately reaches for the
          gun. It's just beyond his grasp.

<b>                         ADAM
</b>          Come on, come on, come on...
          He gets it. But the GUN HAS A GUN LOCK. Adam has to dig in
          his dead father's pockets for his keys. Adam starts to cry.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          3.
</b>
<b>                         ADAM (CONT'D)
</b>          Come on, come on!
          He finds them, struggles to unlock the gun with shaking
          hands.
          THE BED IS TURNED OVER in one violent throw. Adam is
          exposed. We see only a hint of the creature that looms over

<b>                         HIM --
</b>          Brutally strong, veins dark and visible under the skin...
          Human but not quite.
          Adam reacts in horror. He knows he's dead.
          HE's RIPPED OUT OF FRAME as we hear:

<b>           DISC JOCKEY (O.S.)
</b>           .we're looking at a nice day here
           in Clark County, hitting a season
          low of only 89 degrees...

<b>          EXT. SHADOW HILLS - DAY
</b>
          MUSIC starts under the DISC JOCKEY as we LOOK DOWN FROM HIGH
          ABOVE at the SAME suburban neighborhood as before.
          In the daylight it seems nice. Charming, even.
          Pocket parks decorate almost every corner and kids ride bikes
          in the street. Mothers unload groceries. Neighbors chat.

<b>          DISC JOCKEY (O.S.)
</b>          .so get out there and enjoy this
          beautiful Wednesday, people.
          We SWOOP CLOSER and find that RADIO comes from a passing
          MINIVAN with those cutesy stick figure family decals on the
          rear window.
          The FOR SALE SIGNS and brown lawns don't seem nearly so
          foreboding now.
          We SWOOP UP AGAIN and see beyond Shadow Hills, past the WALL
          that encompasses it -- and become aware for the first time
          that the community is SURROUNDED BY FLAT, ARID DESERT.
          In the distance, we can just make out the glow of Las Vegas
          proper. It looks like a distant fantasy, a land-locked
          Pleasure Island.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          4.
</b>
<b>          EXT. STREET - DAY
</b>

<b>                         CLOSE ON:
</b>          The wheels of a DIRT BIKE as it zooms down the street.
          WIDEN to see CHARLIE BREWSTER, who is PUSHING the bike as
          fast as he can. It STARTS, sputters -- then craps out.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          (to the bike/pissed)
          You want me to take you apart, huh?
          Charlie's 17 and has the slightly awkward feel of someone who
           just recently came into his body and good looks.
          He's a wry, thoughtful kid who's enjoying -- but not quite
          trusting -- a sudden surge in popularity.

<b>                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>          (still talking to bike)
          I will. I'll sell you for parts.
          Don't think I won't--
          Charlie stops, embarrassed. DORIS -- a neighbor -- watches
           him talk to his bike. Paused as she hauls her trash cans to
          the curb.
          She's super pretty in a wholesome way -- except for her
          ridiculous body. Stripper city. She nods to the bike,
          amused.

<b>                         DORIS
</b>          Nothing doing, huh?

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          The thing's got no ambition.
          (re: trash cans)
          Can I -- uh, give you a hand?

<b>                         DORIS
</b>          I got it. Thanks.
          She walks away -- her sweatpants have the word "LUCKY" across
          the butt. He watches her go appreciatively. Doesn't notice
          his mom, JANE, struggling to pull their own cans to the curb.

<b>                         JANE
</b>          Don't leer at the neighbors, kid.
          Jane, 40's, attractive and frazzled, wears a REAL ESTATE
          brokers blazer. Charlie wheels his bike back to the curb.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          5.
</b>          He and his mom have had an affectionate, teasing relationship
          which has only recently started to have more edge.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          She's the one who put a word on her
          butt. I'm just reading it.
          Jane eyes a LARGE DUMPSTER FULL OF CONCRETE that sits in
          front of their NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR'S YARD.

<b>                         JANE
</b>          Is he ever going to move that
          thing?

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          You need to get over it, Mom.

<b>                         JANE
</b>
<b>                         (WATCH IT)
</b>          Attitude.
          (observes him/then)
          You've been tense or something.
          School?

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          School's great, actually.

<b>                         JANE
</b>          Amy?

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Good. Hasn't dumped me yet.
          He says this like he's surprised. Jane nods. Getting it.

<b>                         JANE
</b>          That'll teach you to get so tall
          and handsome.

<b>                         (THEN)
</b>          Getting what you want is stressful.
          Especially when you're not used to
          it. More to lose.

</b>          Now Jane moves to the open garage and starts loading OPEN
          HOUSE SIGNS into her trunk. Charlie stands there. She
          shoots him a look -- then he helps her load.

<b>                         JANE
</b>          It's an eyesore. I'm trying to
          convince people to move in, not
          join the legions leaving town--

</b>          If you say "mortgage crisis" again
          I'm getting a new mom.

<b>                         JANE
</b>          The guy moves in and puts a giant
          trash can in his yard! When the
          Perry's lived there--
          Charlie has heard this before. It's a common refrain.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          The Perry's were the greatest
          neighbors ever. But they moved. I
          thought you were happy their place
          finally sold.

          coming from?

<b>                         JANE
</b>          He's thirteen feet from our house.
          That's not spying, that's
          observing.
          A BEETLE CONVERTIBLE pulls up. AMY drives and her two hot
          friends, CARA and BEE, sit in the back.

          him off his game. She makes him feel like he's always
          playing catch up.
          Charlie moves toward the VW. Jane calls after him.

<b>                         JANE (CONT'D)

          to him, would you please tell him?

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Kinda defeats the purpose.
          He gets to AMY and the girls. Amy glances at the dirt bike.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          Still can't get the bike started,

</b>          So you don't need a ride.
          Amy calls his bluff and starts to drive off. Charlie grabs
          his backpack and RACES after her.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          No, hey, stop--
          She laughs, stops the car. Charlie tries to jump in and she
          drives again.

<b>                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>          Come on! Hey!--
          Charlie runs and finally dives into the back headfirst. The
          girls are laughing.

          Charlie's in the front seat now. Amy drives, one hand on the
          wheel. Casually drops one on Charlie's leg. Charlie tries
          to act casual, but he's stoked and... amazed.
          Cara half-sleeps in the back while BEE leans forward, flirty,
          and eyes Charlie's COLORFUL PUMA SNEAKERS. Charlie's a
          sneakerhead, a serious collector.

          A couple of handsome jock-type guys, MARK and BEN, roll up

          The cool kids.

<b>                         BEE

          Charlie moves off. And even though he's playing it off, we
          see that Mark's hit a nerve. This hot girlfriend thing is a

          sees a tweaked-looking kid, ED, staring at him.
          EVIL ED is a slight, faintly punk-looking kid who's been
          picked on by bullies his whole life.

          Ed sees that he's caught Charlie's eye. Nods significantly

          Ed stares Charlie down. A beat. Ben and Mark bust out
          laughing. Mark looks at Charlie.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          Just the two of you. That's sweet.

</b>          It's important. "Brewster."
          The way Ed says his name is enough to propel Charlie into
          action. He grabs Ed and pulls him aside. Mark and Ben watch
          with interest -- out of earshot.
          Ed's tone is dire, serious as a heart attack.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Look, do we have to do this here?
          Ed can't believe it. Charlie's totally blowing him off. He
          starts to lose it, raises his voice--

<b>                         ED
</b>          What, am I not even suppose to
          speak to you now?--

<b>                         ED
</b>          It's so horrible! Crossing the
          streams! Will High School as we
          know it cease to exist?!
          Ed glances at Mark and Ben, who still watch from a distance.

<b>                          ED (CONT'D)
</b>          You want me to tell your pals how
          well we know each other? The Lego

          Moves off. Charlie sees the guys watching him. A beat. He
          shrugs like "I have no idea what that was about..."

<b>          EXT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- FRONT LAWN -- DUSK
</b>
           The sun has set behind the mountains. It's gloomy gray out,
          right before dark.
           Charlie and AMY park, climb out of her car with drinks from
           PLANET SMOOTHIE in hand. She's still in her track and field
          clothes. Looks tough.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          You know what I want? For dinner?

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          You're eating right now, you know.
          As you speak. You literally just
          forced me to get you a smoothie so
          large they named a planet after it--

</b>
<b>                         (LAUGHS)

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          I -- watched you. But not in a
          creepy way.
          Charlie winces a little. It sounds creepy.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          So don't judge. You don't want me
          to burn my big ole' booty off, do
          you?
          Charlie, on impulse, stops her -- kisses her.

<b>                         AMY (CONT'D)
</b>          What was that for?

<b>                         CHARLIE

          A sweet moment. These two have a definite thing. It's real.
          They're about to kiss again when JANE'S GIRLISH LAUGH stops
          them. They both turn and REACT AS THEY SEE...
          A MUSCLED MALE, SQUATTING AND HUNCHED-OVER -- clad only in a
          white wife-beater and jeans. We can't make out his face.
          Jane stands over him, laughing at something he's said as he
          FIXES their sprinkler.
          PUSH IN as the guy looks up. This is JERRY. 30's. Handsome
          to the point of devastating. An all-American Adonis.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          Wow.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Look at Mom. She'sâ€”

<b>                         AMY
</b>          Damn right. If he followed her
          home, you have to let her keep him.
          Amy laughs -- almost skips toward them, milking the moment.

<b>          EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE -- DUSK
</b>
          ED paces anxiously in front of ADAM'S HOUSE. He has a duffle
          bag over his shoulder. Keeps checking his phone.
          He finally dials in a number. Talks--

<b>                         ADAM
</b>          Charlie. I'm in front of Adam's.
          Remember the videos we all made
          back when? You and me and Adam,

          get a load of that?

<b>          EXT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- FRONT LAWN -- DUSK

          Amy and Charlie approach Jane and Jerry. They overhear--

<b>                         JANE
</b>          .so not a pool, what's the work
          you're doing?

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          17.

<b>                         JERRY
</b>          Foundation problems. I had to rip
          up half the basement.

<b>                         JANE
</b>          These houses were built practically
          overnight. I'm never surprised
          when they come apart.

          Jane sees Charlie and Amy approaching. And gaping.

<b>                         JANE
</b>          Jerry, this is my son Charlie. And
          his -- do we say girlfriend now?

          Amy's amused at Charlie's squirming, finally saves him.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          (shakes Jerry's hand)
          Hi. I'm Amy.
          He can't help but give Amy an appreciative once-over. She
          enjoys it, but pulls away and moves closer to Charlie.
          Charlie notices the exchange -- the way this dude oozes
          manliness. Doesn't like it one bit. He shakes Jerry's hand
          a little too firmly. Lowers his voice a bit.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Hey.

<b>                         JANE
</b>          Jerry's our new neighbor. The

</b>          Jerry does night construction on
          the strip.

<b>                         JERRY

          You play ball? I'm always looking
          for a pick up game.

          They sleep on sidewalks to get
          them.
          Charlie looks at Jane, thanks for embarrassing me.

<b>                         JERRY
</b>          Well -- they're bold. I like them.
           Jerry looks back at Jane. A little flirtatious.

<b>                         JERRY (CONT'D)
</b>          So... I'd ask you guys inside, but
          it's a mess. I've been meaning to.

<b>                         JANE
</b>          Be neighborly.

<b>                         JERRY
</b>          A drink, something.
          It hangs there, waiting for an invitation. Jane just smiles.

</b>          Soon, okay?

<b>                         JANE

          For the help.

</b>          Least I could do.
          Jane, Amy and Charlie walk toward the house. Jerry moves
          off. Amy looks at Jane, amazed.

<b>          ON THE PHONE
</b>          A VIDEO CLIP from ED. TITLED "KID COMEBACK and SUPER SQUID!"
          It shows Charlie, Ed and Adam when they were younger,
          prancing around in homemade costumes and, indeed, tights.

          He's flipping out.

<b>                         ED

</b>          Right after! It's dusk, dude, you

<b>                         ED
</b>          Hey! Anybody home?
          A long pause. Nothing.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Not here. Let's go--
           But Ed's already heading around the house with the duffle.

<b>          INT. ADAM'S HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- DUSK
</b>
          Ed wriggles in through the DOG DOOR. He turns, lets Charlie
          in. Charlie looks around.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          This is nuts.
          It's the SAME HOUSE we saw in the opening, but completely
          righted. TV is off, the walls are clean. Furniture in it's
          proper place. It's perfect.
          They move into the house. Ed is wired, scared.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Okay. Fine.
          Ed opens his duffle bag. Inside are CROSSES, STAKES, HOLY
          WATER, even a small AX.

<b>                         ED
</b>          Take this.
          Ed hands Charlie a STAKE. Charlie eyes it, incredulous.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          You've got to be kidding me.
          Ed stops. This is it.

<b>                         ED
</b>          I hate to tell you this but that

          Ed moves UP THE STAIRS. Charlie reluctantly follows. It's
          darker up here. Lights off.

<b>                         ED
</b>          Hey! Anybody here?
          They pass the empty MASTER BEDROOM -- where we saw ADAM's
          parents slaughtered. Now its clean and empty.
          Then Ed turns into ADAM's room. It's full of geekery.
          Action figures, the like. Charlie sticks behind him.
          The guys don't register the mostly obscured form of SOMEBODY
          HIDING BEHIND the door. A LARGE MALE figure.
          Ed catches sight of the guy, and SPINS toward it, freaked.
          Charlie also reacts, scared.

</b>          Get back, demon!
          Ed thrusts his cross forward which knocks the door open,
          toppling A MOVIE CHARACTER STANDEE.
          A beat. Then Ed lets out a slightly manic laugh.

<b>                         ED (CONT'D)
</b>          Ha! I killed that sucker dead!

<b>                         CHARLIE

<b>                         (ANGRY)
</b>          They're not here, okay? They left
          town. His dad was a deadbeat--
          Ed pulls a MAP out of his pocket. It has lots of red and
          black DOTS marked on it. He thrusts it at Charlie.

<b>                         ED
</b>          No, see, it's not just them. It
          started -- there was this thing on
          Channel 13, a lady escaped an
          attacker who tried to bite her.
          Ed points to the RED DOTS on his chart. They form a loose
          circle around CHARLIE'S house.

<b>                         ED (CONT'D)
</b>          Adam and me, we graphed the attack,

</b>          That Jerry's a Dracula.

<b>                         ED

          He feeds, he kills, and he doesn't
          move on until everyone around him
          is dead.

<b>                         (MOST EMPHATIC)
</b>          And that book SUCKS.
          Charlie can't help but pause. Ed's conviction is so real.
          But he shakes it off.

<b>                         CHARLIE

</b>          No! Well, yeah... I thought you'd
          take my word, but I have evidence

          Charlie stops fighting it and humors him. Ed's lost it.

<b>                         CHARLIE

          Ed stops. Stung.

</b>          Undeniably doable, but we used to
          make fun of her and her pals,
          remember? They're bimbos--

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Shut up!
          Charlie barely refrains from hitting Ed. Instead he shoves
          him away. Ed stumbles. Falls.
          He looks up at Charlie, genuinely hurt and desperate.

<b>                         ED
</b>          Adam's gone -- you act like it has
          nothing to do with you.

</b>          Yeah. And you know when I got
          popular? The minute I stopped
          hanging out with you.
          Charlie takes off. Ed watches him go.

<b>                         FADE TO:
</b>
<b>          EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS/VARIOUS -- NIGHT
</b>
          A while later. It's REALLY DARK now.
          Ed, gripping his duffle bag nervously, skates down a
          residential street. Houses here are spaced far apart and the
          lights in many of them are off.
          Ed is anxious, watchful. He knows it's not safe. Every dark
          corner is potentially the end of him.
          A few cars pass. Something moves behind him. Footsteps
          GAINING. Ed abandons his skateboard and BOLTS.
          A hand SLAMS on his shoulder, spins him around. IT's MARK,
          Charlie's pal from school.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          You crossed my yard. Tracked your

<b>                         MORON--
</b>          Ed glances around nervously, it's dark and anything... else
          could be out there.

<b>                         ED
</b>          Can you just hit me? I don't have
          time for the build up.
          (he steels himself)
          Go.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          Seriously?

<b>                         ED
</b>          Jesus, man! Just do it!
          Fine. Mark winds up and SWINGS -- a brutal blow.
          Ed DUCKS and runs. Mark's immediately on his heels.
          The guys dodge and dart through the neighborhood. But Ed has
          experience in the art of losing bullies and he manages to
          shake Mark for a moment.
          Ed scrambles over a wooden fence, but his DUFFLE BAG GETS
          CAUGHT ON TOP. Most of his vamp hunting stuff SPILLS over on
          the OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE.

<b>                         ED (CONT'D)
</b>          Crap. Crap!
          There's not time to get the stuff. He can hear Mark
          approaching in the dark.
          He drops into a neighbor's backyard.

<b>          EXT. BACKYARD -- NIGHT
</b>
          ED spins and slams right into MARK -- no, it's JERRY.
          Ed falls back and scrambles away, terrified.

<b>                         ED (CONT'D)
</b>          Get away! I'm armed mother fucker!
          Jerry moves after Ed, angry but controlled. More like a man
          than a monster.

<b>          EXT. FENCE -- NIGHT

          Mark pulls up on the other side of the wood fence. Sees Ed's
          VAMP HUNTING STUFF on the ground, laughs.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          Unbelievable.
          A beat, Mark glances at the high fence. Decides he's done.
          He kicks some of Ed's stuff as he moves off.

<b>          EXT. BACKYARD -- NIGHT
</b>
          Ed trips over kid's toys and bikes as he runs to the house.
          There's a porch light on over the back door.

<b>                         ED
</b>          (pounding on door)
          Hey! Let me in! Please!
          But there's no answer. Ed is desperate, Sees Jerry closing
          in, walking across the backyard.
          Ed takes a ROCK and smashes the window over the kitchen sink.

<b>          INT. HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NIGHT
</b>
          Ed falls through the window into the kitchen. Looks out.
          JERRY stalks toward him. All hulking menace.
          But Ed's safe now. Calls out--

<b>                         ED
</b>          Forget it sucker! No invite!
          BAM! Jerry kicks in the kitchen door. Ed, terrified, falls
          back.

<b>                         JERRY
</b>          Abandoned. I thought you did your

<b>                         JERRY
</b>          You've been watching me. I've been
          watching you. Seems fair.
          Ed BOLTS into the house.

          As he races through the empty rooms he pulls a stake from his
          pocket. We see he's wearing a cross around his neck on a
          long chain.
          JERRY's following, but barely breaking a sweat.
          Ed sees A SLIDING GLASS DOOR to the back. He fumbles with
          the lock, gets it open and runs into the backyard.

<b>          EXT. BACKYARD -- NIGHT
</b>
          Ed races for the back gate--

<b>          AND SUDDENLY JERKS TO A STOP.
</b>          Jerry has him by the back of the CROSS he's wearing.
          Ed's lifted WAY off his feet by the CHAIN, until he's choking
          on it, the cross directly under his neck.
          JERRY looks away as he SNAPS the chain off Ed and HURLS the
          cross into the neighbor's POOL.
          Ed falls to the ground, watches the cross sink in despair.
          Jerry's standing over him. Smiles a little. We get just a
          flash -- he suddenly has MORE TEETH, sharper, in rows. It's
          chilling.

<b>                         JERRY
</b>          Bit off more than you can chew.
          Shaking, terrified, Ed brandishes the STAKE.

<b>                         ED
</b>          We'll see, man. I know my shit.
          But Jerry doesn't appear to be afraid. He looks at Ed with
          actual sympathy.

<b>                         JERRY
</b>          Really? Who's going to believe
          you? You see the truth, but what
          good is it when you're alone?
          Ed's shaken -- but still grips the stake. Holding on.

<b>                         ED
</b>          Don't play that stuff. That mind
          crap. Come on -- try me. Try me!

          nothing to him now.
          Ed's listening despite himself, hurting now. Jerry moves a
          step in. Ed raises his stake again -- but with slightly less
          conviction.

<b>                         ED

          at JERRY'S HOUSE. The blacked out windows...

<b>                         AMY
</b>          What?
          Charlie snaps out of it. It's crazy to even entertain Ed's
          theories.

          She gets in the car. Smiles a little.

</b>
          Charlie's in class. He's restless, agitated. On his pad, he
          absently draws VAMPIRE images, blood...

<b>                         TEACHER
</b>          Sally Cabella?

          Nothing. Charlie looks up.

<b>                         TEACHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Edward Lee?
          Charlie looks around. No Ed. And just like he said -- quite
          a few other kids are missing. Charlie takes this in, looks
          around.

<b>                         ABOVE CHARLIE

<b>          EXT. BASEBALL FIELD -- DAY
</b>
          Charlie, Mark, Ben and the rest of the guys get ready for
          practice. Mark's in the middle of a story, but Charlie is
          distracted -- barely listening.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          .she's wearing a jumpsuit, dude.
          Like -- one zip and POP!

<b>                         CHARLIE

</b>          What's up with you? Dreaming about
          your little boyfriend?
          Charlie takes this in, worried.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          You see him around today? Ed?

<b>                         BEN
</b>          I don't track "it's" whereabouts.
          What did he want, anyway?

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Nothing. Homework stuff.
          But Charlie's clearly distracted.

<b>                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>          Look, I have to go.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          Now? You're ditching? I'll bail
          with you.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          No -- I'm -- I don't feel so well.
          He takes off. Ben and Mark watch him, perplexed.

<b>          EXT. ED'S HOUSE -- DAY
</b>
          Another suburban development. Rows and rows of red tile
          roofs, houses stacked right on top of one another...
          Charlie rings the bell of a modest place. Not as big as
          where Charlie and Jane live. But nice, well-tended for.
          ED's mom, VICTORIA, answers. She's surprised to see him.

<b>                         VICTORIA
</b>          Charlie!

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Yeah, Hi Mrs. Lee.
          Victoria breaks into a wide smile.

<b>                         VICTORIA
</b>          God you're a sight for sore eyes.

           Victoria pulls Charlie in and hugs him, happy. Calls out--

<b>                         VICTORIA
</b>          Rick! Charlie's here!

<b>                         (TO CHARLIE)
</b>          Look at you. So handsome!

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Oh, I -- you don't have to--
           Now RICK, Ed's dad comes into the room. Shakes his hand.

<b>                         RICK
</b>          Ed said you'd sprouted. And
          you're, the--
          Rick awkwardly gestures around his face.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Cleared up. Yes sir--

<b>                         VICTORIA
</b>          Ed will be so sorry he missed you,
          But -- you should both be in school
          now, shouldn't you?

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          He's not here? Did you see him
          today?

<b>                         RICK
</b>          He's usually up and out early.
          Everything okay?

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          No, sure. We're working on a class
          project. I guess we crossed paths.

<b>                         VICTORIA
</b>          I'm so glad you're doing that. Ed,
          he'd be mad that I said so, but he
          talks about you all the time.
          This lands hard on Charlie. How remiss he's been.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Yeah. That's... He's great.

<b>                         (THEN)
</b>          Would it be okay if I went
          upstairs? Ed has a book we need.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          34.
</b>
<b>                         VICTORIA
</b>          Of course. Make yourself at home.
          Charlie goes upstairs. Victoria makes a face at Rick --
          "that's good!" They're both pleased.

<b>          INT. ED'S ROOM -- DAY
</b>
          Ed's room is a shrine to comic books, horror and fantasy
          movies.
          There's an art table where Ed has been working on some
          illustrations for a noir-style graphic novel. Charlie stops
          and looks at them. They're fantastic.
          He looks at the photos on the wall -- including a few
          pictures of Ed, Charlie and Adam when they were friends.

<b>          CLOSE ON A PHOTO
</b>          Charlie and Ed, arms around each other. Charlie is shorter
          and thinner -- with really bad acne. Not cute. WAY not.

<b>                         ON CHARLIE
</b>          Ouch. Best not to dwell. He turns and sees--
          PETER VINCENT'S "FRIGHT NIGHT" POSTER on a wall. Charlie
          takes it in, laughs a little.
          Then Charlie examines a WHOLE WALL devoted to Ed's
          investigation of Jerry. Maps, news reports, vampire lore
          printed off the internet, books, etc.
          If you didn't know the difference, you'd say it's just more
          of Ed's fictional world.
          Charlie stares at it all for a beat. Then shakes his head.
          It's all a fantasy -- nothing more.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          This is crazy.
          He starts to take off. But sees that Ed's computer is on --
          and one file stands out. "THE JERRY DIARIES."
          Charlie gives in to his curiosity -- clicks it open -- finds
          a bunch of Quicktime files.
          He opens one. Stops.

<b>          CLOSE ON COMPUTER

<b>          35.
</b>          As BLURRY short clips play:

<b>          IT.
</b>          DORIS the neighbor chatting on Jerry's lawn -- with nobody.
          Over and over, it's appears that JERRY DOESN'T SHOW UP on
          video.

<b>                         OFF CHARLIE
</b>          Taking this in. Chilled.

<b>          EXT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- NIGHT
</b>
          It's dark as Charlie comes home. He looks warily at Jerry's
          house as he searches for his keys.
          BAM -- he walks right into JERRY.

<b>                         JERRY
</b>          Hey guy.
          Charlie tries to maintain his cool. What if Jerry is what Ed
          thought? Impossible, but...

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Hey. Guy.

<b>                         JERRY
</b>          You could really do me a solid.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Yeah? What kind.

<b>                         JERRY
</b>          I have a girl on her way over for a
          beer, and I'm totally out of beer.
          They're at Charlie's back door, the one that leads to the
          kitchen.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Bummer.

<b>                         JERRY
</b>          Set me up, I'll pay you back two
          times. A sixer for your mom, and
          one for you.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Uh, yeah, sure.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          36.
</b>          Jerry watches Charlie as he unlocks the door.
          This is when Charlie should invite him in.

<b>                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>          Let me see what Mom's got. She's
          kind of a "light domestic".. .mom.
          Charlie steps inside. Pointedly DOESN'T ask Jerry to enter.
          Charlie intentionally leaves the door open, moves to the
          refrigerator. But keeps his eyes on Jerry. If he steps in,
          uninvited, Ed's theory is blown.

<b>                         JERRY
</b>          Nice kitchen. Same floor plan as
          my place, huh?
          Jerry leans against the door jamb -- BUT DOES NOT CROSS THE
          THRESHOLD. Charlie observes this. Holy shit.
          Charlie and Jerry MEET EYES. Then a cold smile creeps over
          Jerry's face.
          Charlie fumbles, lets one of the wet beers slide from his
          hand -- it hits the ground, explodes.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Fuck!

<b>                         JERRY
</b>          Can I help you with that?

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          No! No. Thanks. I'll get it.
          Jerry takes in Charlie's frantic refusal. Now he's darkly
          certain. He's been made.
          Charlie tosses the broken bottle into the sink. Moves to the
          doorway with the remaining beers.
          Charlie hands them over the threshold. But doesn't cross.

<b>                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>          There you go. Uh...party down.
          Jerry watches him, intense. His tone shifts -- cocky and
          intimidating. A threat disguised as "guy talk."

<b>                         JERRY
</b>          This girl tonight -- she's a
          handful. You know.

<b>                         JERRY

          lot on your shoulders for a kid.
          Your pal, Amy? She's ripe. Must
          be a line of guys dying to pluck
          that. Your mom too -- you don't
          see it, maybe you do -- she's
          giving it off. It's on you to
          watch out for them. You up for
          that?
          Charlie's burning. But holds himself in check.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          I think I can manage.

<b>                         JERRY
</b>          Good. Cause there are bad people
          out there, man. Better keep an eye
          on your women.
          Jerry backs away, intimidating even as he retreats.

<b>                         JERRY (CONT'D)
</b>          Thanks for the beers.
          Charlie watches him move into the dark.

<b>          INT. BREWSTER HOUSE - CHARLIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT
</b>
          Charlie bursts into his room, freaked out -- races to the
          window.
          His room is free of all geekery. Now it's all sports and
          sneakerhead stuff.
          AMY's there -- on his bed and surrounded by school books.
          She's reading Wuthering Heights.

<b>                         AMY

</b>          Hello?
          Charlie breaks away from the window. It's an effort. His
          focus is still half there, even as he tries to talk to Amy.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Sorry. You okay? Everything okay?
          He checks his phone. Checks for anything from ED. Nothing.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          Yeah. Why shouldn't it be?

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          No, it should. Nothing.

          You ever read this? It's good.
          Sexy, actually.
          Amy moves to Charlie. Puts her arms around him.

<b>                         AMY (CONT'D)
</b>          In a frustrated, unconsummated sort
          of way.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Like us, you mean.
          Amy laughs, pulls him onto the bed. She's feeling frisky.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          Kinda makes it hotter.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Yeah, so you keep saying.
          He smiles a little. She kisses him. But feels his distance.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          Am I boring you? What's up?

<b>                         CHARLIE

</b>          I can fix that.
          She kisses him again. Despite himself, Charlie gets drawn in
          and turned on. She pulls back, serious.

          weakens a little. Maybe death and mayhem can wait...
          Amy moves to take off her top. Oh. My. God--
          DING DONG. Somebody is ringing the bell at Jerry's. Charlie
          stops. Practically tosses Amy off him.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          You hear that?
          He rushes to the window. Looks outside.

<b>                         CHARLIE'S POV

</b>          Shit.

<b>                         AMY

          JERRY comes to the door. He and Doris start chatting. She's
          flirting up a storm.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Shit, shit, shit--
          Amy sees what Charlie sees. Shrugs.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          He's hot. She's a stripper. They
          were bound to find each other.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          What? No--
          Jerry is showing Doris in when he stops-and looks DIRECTLY AT
          CHARLIE. It's chilling.
          Charlie DIVES away from the window, grabbing Amy and pulling
          her down too.

<b>                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>          He looked right at us.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          Maybe. Not a big deal--
          Charlie's freaked now. Doris is IN THERE.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          No, it is a big. A very big. He
          saw us and he was pissed.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          Okay...
          Amy moves away. Looking at him skeptically.

<b>                         AMY (CONT'D)
</b>          If you're not into this, say so.
          Don't do me any favors.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          What? No! I am, I totally am.
          just -- I don't trust that guy.
          He glances out the window again. Amy's irritated, not used
          to having her passes rejected. She gathers her stuff.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          I'm going.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Amy. Don't--

          But she's gone.

<b>                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>          Crap!
          A beat. Charlie's torn -- he should go after her. But
          Doris's muted LAUGH from the other house draws his attention.
          He looks again at Jerry's house. He can see faint shadows
          moving behind the windows in the house, like ghosts.
           Charlie's conflicted, freaked -- what can he do? He picks up
          the phone. Dials 911. Then thinks better of it. Hangs up.
          Finally -- he stops at the window, eyes on JERRY'S PLACE.
          Listening and watching intently. Keeping sentry.

          Later. Charlie's fallen asleep in a chair by the window.
          He's startled awake by a woman's SCREAMS. They sound like
          they are coming from Jerry's.
          But are they screams of pleasure or pain?
          Charlie looks out the window. Jerry's house is dark. It's
          all quiet. Charlie looks at the clock. tam.
          Charlie sits back on his bed. Was it a dream? Then Charlie
          hears A MOTOR START. Charlie goes back to the window.
          Jerry's TRUCK starts and Jerry drives off.
          Off Charlie, unsettled.

<b>                         CUT TO:
</b>
<b>          EXT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- BACKYARD -- NIGHT
</b>
          A short while later. Charlie moves cautiously into Jerry's
          backyard. He's wearing ALL BLACK and his dad's old winter
          gloves. He looks at his iPhone.
          ON THE PHONE -- a diagram. "How to pick a lock."

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          42.
</b>          Charlie steels his nerves. At Jerry's back door, he clumsily
          tries to pick the lock. After a moment or two, he realizes
          he has no idea what he's doing.

<b>                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>          Crap.
          He walks away from the door, frustrated. Then turns and
          impulsively tries to KICK IN the DOOR with his foot. Nothing
          happens.
          Then something occurs to Charlie. He goes into the garden.

<b>                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>          The Perrys...
          Charlie finds a FAKE ROCK. Turns it over. It has a KEY in
          it. Charlie's like -- duh.
          He puts the key in the back door lock. It opens.

<b>          INT. JERRY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
          Charlie moves through the first story of the house. He's
          cautious, on edge.
          At first the place seems totally unremarkable. A typical
          "guy pad". Lots of inexpensive furniture, bad art, a salt
          water fish tank...
          At every turn, Charlie expects something or someone to jump
          out at him. It's unbearably tense.

<b>          INT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- UPSTAIRS -- NIGHT
</b>
          Charlie looks upstairs. Moves through a plain white hallway,
          finds an open door that leads to Jerry's office, where he
          keeps an EXTENSIVE LIBRARY.
          On one wall hangs a TAPESTRY that looks very old, decorated
          with a strange INSIGNIA. Charlie takes a picture of it with
          his phone.

<b>          INT. JERRY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
</b>
          Charlie goes into Jerry's bedroom - opens his closet. Sees a
          variety of UNIFORMS. Cop, gas man, UPS, etc. Charlie
          reacts, chilled.
          Charlie stops. JERRY'S TRUCK is pulling into the driveway.
          Charlie's in a panic. Jerry will be inside any moment.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          43.
</b>          There's no time to get out so Charlie ducks into the CLOSET.

<b>          INT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- CLOSET -- NIGHT
</b>
          Charlie pushes as far back into the closet as he can go.
          Leans against the back wall.
          The BACK OF THE CLOSET SWINGS OPEN and Charlie falls back
          into a HIDDEN HALLWAY.
          Charlie stands, stunned, see that the hallway is lined by
          small rooms on either side.
          It's clear that these are additions Jerry's added. Each room
          has a small rectangular WINDOW, so you can see in.
          Charlie reacts, sick. It looks like a prison. Despite the
          danger, he creeps over and looks in one of the rooms--

<b>          WHAM!!
</b>          A pale HAND slaps against the window. Charlie jumps.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Fuck! --
          DORIS is in the window now. Bruised and so pale she looks
          almost BLUE.

<b>                         DORIS
</b>          Help...

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Oh my God. Oh, shit--
          Charlie tugs on the door. Locked.
          He stands back, what to do? Charlie hears a NOISE. The
          FRONT DOOR. And then -- JERRY'S FOOTSTEPS approaching.

<b>                         DORIS
</b>          Oh... Oh no... Get me out of here!
          Doris pounds on the door. In a cold panic.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          I'm -- I won't leave you--
          But Charlie has no choice. The footsteps are getting CLOSER.

<b>                         DORIS
</b>          Please! No! Don't go!

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          44.
</b>          Charlie ducks inside one of the CELLS across from Doris,
          moves behind the door.
          JERRY steps into the hallway, walks right by Charlie's hiding
          place. Pauses near him.
          The door is ajar. Was it that way before? Charlie holds his
          breath.
          Jerry moves to the CELL and retrieves DORIS's half-alive body
          from it.
          Charlie cautiously looks through the crack in the door.

<b>                          DORIS (CONT'D)
</b>          .no... . God, no... please...
          The door to Doris's cell open. Charlie can see PART of
          Doris's body and face.
          Jerry is mostly obscured, bent over Doris -- holding her.
          Charlie watches helplessly, horrified.

<b>                         DORIS (CONT'D)
</b>          Please, please... don't kill me.
          Doris's body TENSES and starts to jerk, as Jerry TUGS AND
          RIPS AT IT SAVAGELY. It's clear he's FEEDING ON HER,
          although we can't see his face.
          Doris screams, then starts to cry. It's stark and REAL and
          terrifying.
          It seems to go on and on. Doris weakens, her head lolling to
          one side, her light fading.
          A small stream of blood spreads across the white pavement.
          In the position she's in, she is eye to eye with CHARLIE.
          She sees him, smiles weakly. Then mouths something -- too
          weak to make much sound.

<b>                          DORIS (CONT'D)
</b>          Cha... Cha...
          CHARLIE is petrified. Doris gets it -- smiles a little
          grimly, puts a finger to her lips. Silence.
          After what seems like an eternity, Jerry is satisfied. He
          tosses Doris aside and stands away from her.
          Charlie DUCKS behind the door as Jerry emerges and casually
          wipes a spot of blood from his mouth.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          45.
</b>          Then Jerry LOCKS DORIS back into her cell. Pockets the key
          and moves off toward the stairs. After a moment, he's gone.
          The sound of a TV starts in Jerry's living room. Something
          banal like "The Real Housewives of Orange County."
          Charlie knows this is his moment. With shaking hands, he
          retrieves his iPhone and pulls up the "HOW TO PICK A LOCK"
          screen.
          Charlie looks through the window in Doris's cell. She's
          breathing -- alive.
          Charlie whispers to himself as he uses a bobby pin and a tiny
          screwdriver on the lock.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Please... Please...
          The bobby pin slips. Drops. Charlie's losing it. Steadies
          himself. Tries again.

<b>                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>          Come on.
          The tension is unbearable. Charlie can hear JERRY moving
          downstairs.

<b>                         CLICK
</b>          The lock slides open. Charlie breathes with relief. Then he
          grabs Doris and BOLTS.
          Charlie SLIPS in a pool of blood left behind from Jerry's
          feeding, but he manages to stay on his feet.
          He pushes Doris ahead of him, to a BACK STAIRCASE.
          His PHONE drops out of his pocket, he has to double back --
          every moment counts. Doris's barely aware of what's
          happening, let alone where she is.

<b>          INT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- STAIRWELL/ENTRY -- DAWN
</b>
          A moment later. Charlie and Doris emerge downstairs, near
          the entry hall. They can see the front door -- and hear
          Jerry moving in another room.
          Charlie looks around, trying to get oriented.
          JERRY emerges -- almost sees them. Charlie ducks into a
          hiding spot and grabs Doris, covering her mouth.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          46.
</b>          A long beat as Jerry returns to the living room with a beer.
          Settles in a chair facing away from the door.
          Charlie considers his options. Says almost silently:

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Same floor plan.
          He grabs Doris and bolts for the kitchen.

<b>          INT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- DAWN

          A back door. Leading out. Charlie and Doris race for it,
          DORIS stumbles and bumps into a chair. Stifles a cry.

          Jerry turns at the noise.

<b>          INT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- DAWN

          Charlie throws the back door open, he and DORIS ESCAPE.

          The sun is just starting to rise. Charlie races for his
          house, with Doris holding on to him tight. She's crying with
          gratitude and relief, manages--

<b>                         DORIS
</b>          Thank you, thank you...
          Doris looks up at him, her EYES TURNING BLACK, her veins
          going gray. A first ray of pure sunlight hits them.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Doris?
          In a flash, DORIS starts to BURN. Charlie is helpless to stop
          it as she GOES UP IN FLAMES and explodes.

<b>                         CHARLIE REACTS

          Jerry moves into the kitchen.

          And there are BLOODY prints on the floor from Charlie's

          Jane moves to the windows, throws the curtains open. Charlie
          winces at the sun. He got no sleep, looks like hell.

          Charlie is genuinely impressed. The geek in him can't help
          it. Peter enters, talks to Arthur--

<b>                         PETER
</b>          Midori me.
          Arthur pours Peter a green drink as Peter pulls off his black
          wig (bandana attached) and peels off a nude body shirt that
          has a bunch of TATTOOS printed on it.
          He steps out of his boots, with three-inch LIFTS. Collapses
          into an arm chair. He's just another balding, middle-aged
          guy with bad eyes.
          Peter downs his drink. Arthur hands him the bottle. Peter
          looks at Charlie.
          In truth, Peter's isolated himself to the point that he
          actually welcomes a visitor -- though he'd never admit it.

          heart. Bam!

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          So all that actually works?

<b>                         PETER
</b>          How the fuck do I know.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          I thought you're--

<b>                         PETER
</b>          I read books, man. You think I'm
          hanging out with Dracula and the
          Easter Bunny?

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Sorry. No.
          Charlie realizes he has no choice. He has to reveal more.

<b>                          CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>           I -- I have a personal interest in
          this story.
          (off Peter's look)
          A friend's missing, actually. I
          think one of them got him.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          Them, meaning a "vampire."

<b>                         CHARLIE

<b>                         CHARLIE

          some time to load but...
          Charlie moves to Peter, shows him his phone. Digs into his
          pocket.

          took. In his place. Or lair...
          Charlie put the photos in front of Peter on the table.
          Peter's expression closes. He stands, pissed.

<b>                         PETER

<b>                         PETER
</b>          You're a nutjob. Arthur!
          Charlie deflates -- his desperation showing again.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Listen to me. I saw it. I saw him
          kill a girl. She burned up in my
          hands. You have to tell me how to

          Arthur enters.

<b>                         PETER

</b>          No you don't. See this guy?
          He gestures to ARTHUR.

<b>                         PETER (CONT'D)
</b>          My cousin, Art. He's "me" on

          Charlie's getting angry now.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          He already got my friend! I know

          know this. Just tell me what to
          do!
          Peter feels Charlie's sincerity. For a moment he looks
          genuinely conflicted. But his expression hardens.

<b>                         PETER

</b>          You heard me.
          He moves away. But Charlie is on his heels. Peter looks to
          ARTHUR, nods.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          So I save my own skin so he can
          keep killing!? I won't. We have
          to kill him! Please!--
          Arthur THROWS Charlie out, the door closed firmly behind him.

          Moving in on the Brewster home, an odd sight is revealed.
          Every window is draped with strings of GARLIC.
          Charlie's revealed in his window -- hammering up another long
          rope of the stuff.
          His gaze falls on JERRY'S HOUSE and we follow it.

          Now we find that Charlie's entire room is decked out in anti-
          vamp decor. Not just the garlic but crosses and other
          religious pictures, etc.
          Charlie LOOKS at the clock -- night coming too quickly. He's
          grimly focused as he starts sharpening a STAKE.
          A knock. Jane doesn't enter this time. Another knock.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          What?
          Jane walks in. Takes in the decor.

<b>                         JANE
</b>          The whole house looks like that
          show Dark Shadows.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          It's a gag. For Amy. Long story.

<b>                         JANE
</b>          (takes this in/then)
          You like her a lot, don't you?
          A moment when they could connect. But Charlie just nods.
          Jane's disappointed. Then--

<b>                         JANE (CONT'D)
</b>          Don't use tape on the walls.

<b>                         (THEN)
</b>          Oh. Ed's parents left a few
          messages, looking for him.
          Charlie looks up at this. Pained.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Okay.
          He goes back to his work. Jane looks at him for a beat, then
          she starts to go.

          pushes past her.

           Charlie races downstairs. Stops. AMY is standing in the
          living room.

<b>                         CHARLIE

<b>                         AMY
</b>          Okay, whatever, listen. You're
          flipping out. Punching out your
          friends and blowing everything off

          A beat. He forgot he was holding it. He hides it behind his
          back.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          No.
          Amy sits, upset. Looks around and sees that the living room
          is decked in more anti-vamp decor.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          Look. Even if you're losing it --
          you don't get to blow me off. You

          Charlie takes this in, emotional. But--

<b>                         CHARLIE

          Now there's another KNOCK at the door. Jane comes downstairs-

</b>          I got it--

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          NO. Don't answer it.

          JERRY stands at the door. Quietly enraged.

<b>                         JANE
</b>          This is ridiculous--

<b>                         JERRY

</b>          This is my house. I'll answer the

          She starts to move to the door again. Charlie blocks her
          way, desperate.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Mom. He murdered Ed and Adam. And

<b>          JERRY (O.S.)
</b>          He broke into my house. I'd rather

          Charlie sags with relief. A brief look of appreciation
          passes between Charlie and Jane.

<b>                         ON JERRY

          y, Charlie and Jane race into the garage

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          66.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          I can drive--

<b>                         JANE
</b>          I drive!
          They jump into Jane's car. Hit the garage opener--

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Gun it Mom! Go!!!
          Jane GUNS IT THROUGH THE OPENING GARAGE DOOR, destroying it.
          She CLIPS Charlie's dirt bike -- pushing it onto the sidewalk
          as she takes off.
          Jane's car swings wide into the street, almost smashing into
          an arriving FIRE ENGINE! Charlie, Amy and Jane SCREAM!!
          They narrowly avoid a head-on collision with a FIRE TRUCK.

<b>                         ON JERRY
</b>          As he sees the dirt bike in the driveway. He jumps on.
          Tries to start it. NO GO. Fuck.

<b>          INT. JANE'S CAR -- NIGHT
</b>

<b>                         JANE
</b>          What did we do!? What does he
          want!?
          They are racing away when the DIRT BIKE COMES CRASHING
          THROUGH THE BACK WINDOW of the car, nearly taking Amy's head
          off.

<b>                         AMY
</b>
<b>                         HOLY--
</b>          Everyone reacts. Then the BIKE STARTS - the wheels spinning
          wildly in the back seat.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Amy!
          Amy's hair gets caught in the spokes - it's horrible as it
          YANKS part of her hair out.
          Charlie grabs her away from the bike -- she falls into his
          arms, crying as JERRY's BIG PICKUP appears in the rear
          windshield.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          67.

<b>                         JANE
</b>          He's coming!

<b>          THEY SWERVE OUT THE SHADOW HILLS GATES
</b>
<b>          EXT. MAJOR STREET -- NIGHT
</b>
          Jane speeds down the street, which is wide and not heavily
          trafficked here.
          Unlike the planned community of Shadow Hills -- now we can
          see we're surrounded by great expanses of empty DESERT.
          JERRY'S TRUCK SMASHES REPEATEDLY into JANE'S.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          My brother has a gun!

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Good to know! Is he here?!

<b>                         JANE
</b>          Call the police! Anybody--
          Jane manages to evade Jerry until --
          The TRUCK SKIDS in a long arc in front of them and BLOCKS
          THEM. Jane screeches to a halt.

<b>                         JANE (CONT'D)
</b>          Oh hell.
          In a flash, Jerry is out of the truck and coming for them.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          GO! Go! Don't stop!! Go--
          Charlie steps on the accelerator, grabs the wheel and AIMS

<b>          THE CAR AT JERRY.
</b>
<b>                         JANE
</b>          Charlie!!
          They RUN JERRY OVER WITH A TERRIBLE THUDDDD!!! Amy and Jane
          scream. Jane is aghast, stops the car.

<b>                         JANE (CONT'D)
</b>          Oh my God!!
          Charlie steps on her accelerator foot, the CAR ZOOMS FORWARD.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          68.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          Are you nuts!? You can't kill that
          guy!

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          You have no idea.

<b>                         (TO JANE)
</b>          It's him or us. Mom. MOM.
          Jane looks at him -- can feel that he's telling the truth.
          Charlie's looking around as they speed down the highway, in
          the rearview. NO JERRY anywhere.

<b>                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>          Where is he? Where'd he go?
          Everybody looks UP. The roof of the car.
          BAM! Jerry's hand SHOOTS up through the FLOORBOARD under
          Jane's feet.
          Jane and Amy SCREAM!

<b>          CLOSE ON THE FLOOR OF THE CAR
</b>          JERRY'S EYE glares through the small hole. It's all BLACK.
          No pupil. Freaky.
          He's TEARING THROUGH METAL from the undercarriage of the car,
          where he's clinging -- face up.
          The more he rips away -- the more he reveals his face.
          His veins and eyes are BLACK. His nose snout-like. And his
          fangs emerge from lethal rows of jagged teeth, like a SHARK.
          It's shocking, horrible.

<b>          ON THE UNDERSIDE OF THE CAR
</b>          As Jerry drags over the highway, the pavement grinding away
          at his clothes and flesh.
          He reaches through the hole he's made and SLAMS his fist down
          on the FLOOR BREAK. The car SCREECHES to a sudden halt.
          ON CHARLIE, AMY and JANE
          Screaming even after the car has stopped. Then -- BAM!! The
          car is REAR-ENDED by another vehicle. It's a MINIVAN.
          JANE's car is SLAMMED -- the back is a crush of glass and
          metal.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          69.
</b>          A GRIM MOMENT -- only the sound of hissing air and groaning
          steel as everyone assesses the damage.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          Oh... Are you-- Jane?
          Jane is woozy. Hurt.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Mom?

<b>                         JANE
</b>          I'm okay...
          Charlie sees that the other car is drivable. The guy inside,
          a FAMILY MAN, is stunned and pissed. Gets out of his car--

<b>                         FAMILY MAN
</b>          What the hell do you think you're
          doing!--
          Charlie gets out of the car too. Yells, urgent--

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          NO! Hey man, stay in your--
          But it's too late. The guy is met by a HORRIFIC Jerry,
          hideously torn and bleeding, who appears from UNDER JANE'S

<b>          CAR.
</b>          In a flash, Jerry grabs the guy and VAMPS, ripping the family
          man's NECK OUT.

<b>          CLOSE ON MINIVAN
</b>          As those "cute" stick figure family decals are splattered
          with BLOOD.

<b>          AMY AND JANE
</b>          Now out of the car, react. JERRY IS A FUCKING VAMPIRE.
          Jerry drops the business man, who's dead as he hits the
          ground. He moves toward them.
          Charlie looks at Amy and Jane. I told you so.

<b>                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>          Yeah.
          Charlie urgently grabs them. Shoves them down the highway.

<b>                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>          Get out of here. Run. Run!

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          70.

<b>                         AMY
</b>
<b>                         BUT--
</b>
<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Go! I'll catch up! She's hurt,
          get out of here!
          They back off.
          Charlie pulls a large cross out of his coat and brandishes it
          as he walks toward Jerry. Jerry keeps his distance, taunting

<b>                         HIM--
</b>
<b>                         JERRY
</b>          Let them run. Just makes them
          easier to kill when I'm done with
          you.
          Ding, ding, ding -- the family man's CAR DOOR is open and the
          warning bell rings over and over...
          CHARLIE eyes the car. Keys still in it. He circles Jerry,
          backing him off.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          I repel you with the power of
          Christ the Lord.

<b>                         JERRY
</b>          Do you? Really? When did you take
          your last confession?

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Get back...

<b>                         JERRY
</b>          That's a mighty big cross you have
          there. Question is -- do you
          actually know how to use it?
          Jerry LUNGES for Charlie, but he DIVES for the family man's
          open car door.
          But Jerry's on him -- hands BURNING as he rips the cross from
          Charlie and shatters it with his hand.
          Then he TOSSES Charlie, who flies and hits JANE'S CAR, then
          crumples to the ground.
          Jerry gets Charlie around the neck -- holds a sharp,
          splintered end of the broken cross against Charlie's chest.
          The wood still burns into Jerry's hand, but Jerry holds on.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          71.
</b>
<b>                         JERRY (CONT'D)
</b>          Ever take one of these in the
          chest? I have.
          Charlie struggles, terrified.

<b>                         JERRY (CONT'D)
</b>          But they missed the heart.
          Rigggght... . here. Easy
          measurement.
          Jerry positions the "stake" right over Charlie's heart.
          Charlie winces. Terrified and overpowered.

<b>                         JERRY (CONT'D)
</b>          Shouldn't have been so nosey.
          Jerry's about to plunge the STAKE through Charlie's heart
          when a THICK WOOD STAKE comes through Jerry's SHOULDER.
          Jerry HOWLS, falls off Charlie and we see that he's been
          staked by the business end of a REAL ESTATE SIGN.
          JANE stands over them, quaking with fear and adrenaline.
          Amy's right behind her with a CROWBAR.

<b>                         JANE
</b>          Leave my kid alone.
          Jane collapses, and we see that there's a lot of BLOOD on the
          back of her head.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Mom!
          Jerry's in agony as he stumbles away, pulls the sign post out
          of his shoulder.
          Charlie grabs his mom and drags her into her wreck of a car.
          Amy dives into the car with them.
          Charlie presses the accelerator. Will it still drive?

<b>                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>          Come on come on come on...
          IT LURCHES forward, then goes. Metal scraping the ground,
          raining glass... but it RUNS.
          They start to bolt when BAM! JERRY STANDS UP right in front
          of the car, LUNGES AT THEM. CHARLIE RUNS OVER JERRY'S BODY
          AGAIN. They speed off.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>                         72
</b>          Jerry writhes in the middle of the road. But even as he
          does, he HEALS. His body knitting itself back together...

<b>          INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR/JANE'S ROOM -- NIGHT
</b>
          Charlie's giving a report to a pair of uniformed cops.

<b>                         COP #1
</b>          So a gas leak caused the fire at
          your home and...

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          My mom didn't feel right, we were
          trying to get her to the hospital.
          It was stupid to let her drive.

<b>                         COP #1
</b>          Yeah it was. And driver who rear-
          ended you, you get the exact make
          and name of the van?

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          It wasn't there when you got there?

<b>                         COP #2
</b>          Hit and run. Happens all the time.
          Charlie stifles his surprise. Nods.

<b>          ANGLE ON AMY
</b>          On her cell, pacing as she eyes Charlie with the cops.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          We won't stay up all night. Bee
          and Cara need help with Trig --
          it's not a party. Okay. Okay...

<b>                         (THEN/EMOTIONAL)
</b>          Mom? I love you.
          She stops at the open door of a hospital ROOM. Her gaze

<b>                         FALLING ON--
</b>
<b>                         JANE
</b>          Who lies motionless in a bed. A doctor checks her chart.
          AMY hangs up. Charlie, finished with the cops, joins her.
          They're both pained as they look at Jane.

<b>                         AMY (CONT'D)
</b>          Maybe you should have said
          something to the police.

</b>
<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Like what? A vampire moved next
          door, borrowed some beer, ate a
          stripper and then blew up our house
          because we wouldn't invite him in?
          Amy looks at him.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          Okay.
          The DOCTOR approaches.

<b>                         DOCTOR
</b>          You should get some rest.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          She's going to wake up, right?

<b>                         DOCTOR
</b>          Assuming the swelling is minimal, I
          hope so.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          But you don't know.

<b>                         DOCTOR
</b>          Not yet. We need to give it time.
          The doctor puts a hand on Charlie's shoulder, leaves.
          Charlie turns away, upset. Amy watches, feeling helpless.

<b>          INT. PETER'S "MUSEUM"/LIBRARY -- NIGHT
</b>
          Peter, in a bathrobe, looks out his floor-to-ceiling windows
          at the lights of the strip.
          The ASSISTANT from the show toddles out on high heels and a
          ridiculous mini-dress. Her hair is messy, post sex.

<b>                         ASSISTANT
</b>          Bye babe. Good show tonight.
          He's barely paying attention.

</b>          You were late again on "The Devil's
          Torture Chamber."
          But she's gone.
          A beat. He moves back toward the library shelves. As he
          does he notices the PHOTOS Charlie took at Jerry's place.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          74.
</b>          Absently, he sifts through them. Stops.
          He picks up the one of the INSIGNIA.
          Peter reacts. Stunned. This means something to him.
          He goes to a WALL SAFE. Opens it. Hidden inside are a bunch
          of personal items. Some from his childhood. Old photos of
          his mother and father...
          And a hand-drawn sketch, in a youthful scrawl, of THE
          INSIGNIA. He puts the two side by side. They MATCH.
          Off PETER, looking at the sketches. Haunted.

<b>          INT. HOSPITAL -- JANE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

          Charlie and Amy sit on a tiny couch. Both are scared and
          regretful.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          This is my fault.

<b>                         AMY

<b>                         CHARLIE

          or Ben? I like that you're
          different... It didn't hurt that
          your skin cleared up.
          She smiles, takes his hand. A sweet, connected moment. Then

</b>          I think we should kill the vampire
          first. I'll perform much better.
          They laugh -- trying not to cry. Then:

          queen? Embarrassment of riches!
          CHARLIE SHOVES the case he hides behind with Amy over ONTO
          ED. Yells to Amy--

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>
<b>          GO!
</b>          Amy bolts from the room as Charlie punches the glass out on
          another case that holds the battle axe. He grabs the weapon.
          Ed SHOVES the cabinet off him with his good hand, stands.
          Charlie and Ed face off.

<b>                         ED
</b>          Mano e...one mano. Piece of cake.
          Cause I'm a God Damned killing
          machine, and you're like all the
          Clark High big shots -- nothing.

<b>                         (THEN)
</b>          You picked the wrong side, man.
          Ed lashes out, slicing CHARLIE on the arm with his SHARP
          NAILS. Charlie yells, but holds his ground.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          I didn't pick--

<b>                         ED
</b>          You didn't think.
          Charlie's wrecked about what he has to do.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          I know. I'm sorry.
          Charlie takes a swing with the AXE. Ed starts BOUNDING
          around the room, avoiding Charlie's swings as he clings to
          walls and, impossibly, THE CEILING.

<b>                         ED
</b>          Steeeerike! Call that a swing,
          Slugger?
          Charlie swings and swings, but Ed is too fast for him.
          Finally, Charlie connects with ED'S NECK. Blood flies,
          Charlie can't look -- anguished.

<b>           ED (O.S.) (CONT'D)

<b>          84.
</b>          Charlie looks back, Ed's HEAD is only HALF OFF. He's
          grinning even as he bleeds everywhere. It's macabre,
          horrible.
          Ed SLASHES Charlie again with his claw-like nails. Charlie
          cries out.

<b>          INT. PETER'S LIBRARY/"MUSEUM" -- NIGHT

          Amy can hear Charlie yell.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          Charlie!
          She smashes into one GLASS CABINET after another, pulling out
          and pocketing everything she can find to fight ED. Finds a
          GUN loaded with silver bullets...

          She's shaking, terrorized. BAM, BAM, BAM!!
          She empties the GUN into JERRY anyway. It knocks him back,
          but he's still standing. He picks a silver bullet out of his
          shoulder, unimpressed.

          ED is already starting to heal as he and Charlie continue to
          fight. But his head still flops hideously to one side.

<b>                         ED

          Hard to cut.
          Charlie takes another swing with his axe. Ed jumps out of
          the way.

</b>          Is this weird for you too? I feel

          Charlie FLIPS ED -- they are wrestling when Charlie sees AMY
          approaching with A SPIKED MACE. Charlie DUCKS and AMY
          smashes ED in the head. Hard.
          Charlie grabs a long, sharp piece of the shattered wooden
          cabinet.
          Ed is on the ground. Moaning, laughing. Charlie has his
          shot. But he hesitates.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          Do it. Charlie!
          Charlie's frozen.
          Ed starts to get up, his head a mess. It's now or never.

<b>                         ED
</b>          Wow. Bimbo has some juice--

</b>          (to Ed/pained)
          I'm sorry.
          WHAP, Charlie stakes ED in the heart. Ed looks at Charlie
          with surprise...
          Ed's hideous features seem to dissolve. For a brief moment --
          he looks like himself again.

<b>                         ED
</b>          I wasn't even a badass vamp. I was

          Ed starts to VIBRATE HORRIBLY, his WHOLE BODY moving so
          impossibly fast he's little more than a BLUR...
          Then he BURNS UP FROM THE INSIDE OUT.
          Charlie's paralyzed -- in a world of hurt.
          Amy grabs him. Pulls him out of the room.

          JERRY, VAMP-FACED and recovering from the holy water, sees
          AMY and CHARLIE running up ahead.
          He sprints after them. Charlie sees him and TOPPLES A GIANT
          FIGURINE in his path, as well as cabinets, etc...
          They slow Jerry down enough to get slightly ahead.

<b>                         AMY

</b>
<b>          INT. PETER'S PANIC ROOM -- NIGHT
</b>
          Peter sits huddled in a corner, ashamed and shaking.
          The SECURITY CAMERA flicks through different rooms, until it
          lands on his dead cousin, ARTHUR.
          It's like Peter's looking at his own mutilated corpse.
          OFF PETER, terrified.

<b>          INT. CASINO -- NIGHT
</b>
          Amy and Charlie emerge from the stairway.
          They find themselves ON THE FLOOR of a HARD ROCK TYPE CASINO,
          which is on the bottom of the building where Peter lives.
          Amy slows as they fold into the crowds. Relieved.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          Stop. Stop, I need to--

<b>                         CHARLIE

<b>          87.
</b>          Amy takes in the people on the floor. Drunk, oblivious. Two
          guys YELL and FIGHT at a craps table. A couple makes out in
          a dark corner, etc. It's loud, chaotic.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          Oh, God...

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Keep moving. Come on.
          Now Charlie sees JERRY some distance behind them now, moving
          toward them in the crowd. They meet eyes.
          Charlie grabs Amy, scans for someplace to hide. He spots a
          nightclub -- "REFLECTIONS".
          The outside walls are all mirrored, like a brightly lit
          diamond.

<b>                         ON JERRY
</b>          Behind them in the crowd, he sees them slip into the club.

<b>          INT. REFLECTIONS - NIGHT
</b>
          The inside of the club is made up of MIRRORS AND WINDOWS.
          The dance floor is PACKED. All writhing bodies and sweaty
          abandon.
          It's dizzying, disorienting.
          Charlie sees JERRY enter, look around for them. The best bet
          to get lost is to dive into the crowd.
          Charlie leads Amy through the throngs of people -- the
          different levels of the club are like a maze. Glass
          staircases lead to mirrored balconies...
          A hopped-up DJ climbs up on a balcony, starts throwing t-
          shirts into the crowd.

<b>                         DJ
</b>          Tequila Man t-shirts! Yeeeeeahhhh!
          The crowd goes nuts, SURGES forward...
          Someone bumps Amy and Charlie and they lose hands.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          Charlie!
          Charlie turns, a DRUNK CHICK gets in his way -- tries to
          dance with him. He pushes past her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          88.
</b>
<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Amy? Amy!
          Charlie can't see Amy, instead sees HIMSELF over and over
          again in a series of mirrors -- the infinity effect.
          It's dizzying, disorienting.
          THEN HE SEES JERRY, a shark, moving in and out of the crowd,
          disappearing behind mirrored columns, reemerging...
          Charlie also sees that JERRY DOESN'T REFLECT in the mirrors
          around them. Instead the crowd parts as if by magic.
          Jerry's heading straight toward--

<b>                         AMY
</b>          who's been pushed toward the DJ stand by the crowd. She's
          spinning, looking desperately for Charlie.

<b>                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>          Amy!
          Charlie's frantically pushing toward her. But the CRUSH of
          people makes it nearly impossible to gain ground.

<b>          CLOSE ON AMY
</b>          As a HAND slips into hers. She turns, relieved, to find--

<b>                         JERRY
</b>          Holding her with a firm grip.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          No. No!
          Amy STRUGGLES and CRIES OUT as JERRY PULLS HER away from
          CHARLIE, toward ramp that leads to another dance floor.
          Jerry laughs, throws her over his shoulder.

<b>                         AMY (CONT'D)
</b>          Help!!
          A GUY in the crowd high-fives him. All part of another crazy
          night in Vegas.

<b>                         GUY
</b>          Go get her, man!
          AMY sees her fast-moving reflection in the mirror -- she
          appears to be FLOATING above the people.

          CHARLIE can SEE HER, but can't get to her. The crowd is
          indifferent to her cries.
          Charlie grabs his cell -- hits a button. It dials, then--

          He hangs up.

<b>          INT. REFLECTIONS -- SECOND STORY -- CONT.

          Jerry, hidden away from Charlie now, puts Amy down. She
          tries to run, but he holds her tight.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          Charlie's coming, he'll find me--

<b>                         JERRY
</b>          I'm counting on it.
          Amy SPITS on him. Jerry reacts -- a flash of RAGE and he
          exposes his brutal rows of TEETH for just an instant.

<b>                         JERRY (CONT'D)
</b>          Come on.
          He grips her harder, sways with her to the music. Leans
          close to her ear, seductive.
          His predatory skills in high gear.

<b>                         JERRY (CONT'D)
</b>          You just need a taste. You'll see.
          It can be like a dream.
          Jerry draws a nail over his wrist, draws a line of blood. He
          puts his mouth over the cut, bloodying it.
          He forces her into a DEEP KISS. She struggles mightily --
          but then her body relaxes, as if she's been sedated.

          JERRY looks up sees CHARLIE coming toward them.
          But Amy's altered now. Staring into Jerry's eyes like a
          child.
          CHARLIE'S GETTING CLOSER when--

</b>          The doorman glances at JERRY and AMY. Jerry stokes Charlie's
          anguish -- running his hands over Amy's ass, kissing her
          neck.

<b>                         DOORMAN
</b>          Yeah? Then she's liking it.
          Charlie's beside himself, enraged and terrorized.

<b>                         JERRY

          Jerry locks eyes with Charlie and SMILES, his horrible fangs
          exposed. He's taking Charlie's woman -- and enjoying it.

<b>                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>          One way or the other, that's how
          it's going to be and you're going
          with me.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          Don't you get what this is?
          There's no fighting. There's only
          surviving, if you're lucky--

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          You call this surviving? If you
          live and we all die, you think
          you'll ever be able to get us out
          of your head?

<b>                         PETER
</b>          I know I won't. I never could --
          not after the first time.
          This stops Charlie.

<b>                         PETER (CONT'D)
</b>          I told myself I probably made it
          up. I was a kid. Maybe it was
          easier to believe in monsters...

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Made what up?

<b>                         PETER
</b>          The vampire who killed my parents,
          my brothers. But not me. I hid.
          Charlie reacts. Surprised, but now it all makes sense.
          Peter continues, haunted--

<b>                         PETER (CONT'D)
</b>          I didn't collect all this stuff for
          fun. I thought maybe I could find
          the tribe, "avenge" my people.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          So do it. We'll go in at dawn.
          He's got to rest sometime--

<b>                         PETER
</b>
<b>                         (HARD)
</b>          It's not like that. When I was a
          kid, I hid because I wanted to
          live. I still do! This isn't the
          comics. You want to be a dead
          hero. Good for you. But I'm out.

          realist.
          Moment of hesitation for Charlie. Has he been affected by
          Peter's words? Then--

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          So you bail on people, erase them.

<b>                         (THEN)

          man I have to be.
          A moment. Peter is full of self-loathing, but resolved.
          Charlie turns to leave.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          Wait.
          Peter takes something from his luggage. A stake carved from
          WHITE WOOD. He hands it to Charlie.

<b>                         PETER (CONT'D)
</b>          Blessed by Saint Michael. Kill a
          vampire with it -- it's supposed to
          turn his victims back. If Amy's
          changed, you can still save her.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          Who knows what's for real any more.
          Charlie takes the stake. Starts to go. Peter stops him--

<b>                         PETER (CONT'D)
</b>          There's no guarantee he'll be
          asleep during the day. He's
          housebound, not hibernating.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          I'll figure it out.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          No, you need a plan. To stake him,
          you have to get close -- he's
          stronger than you.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Holy water?

</b>          Torch him, you'll have a few good
          minutes before he really goes up.
          Believe me, a vampire on fire isn't
          thinking clearly.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          But if he's on fire, how do I get
          close enough to stake him?
          A beat.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          Fuck.

</b>
<b>                         (POINTED)
</b>          You just worry about yourself.
          With that, Charlie leaves.
          Off PETER. Disgusted with himself.

<b>          INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT/DAY
</b>
          Charlie sits by Jane's bedside. She's still comatose.
          We move closer and see that Charlie's drawing a MAP OF
          JERRY'S HOUSE on some scrap paper -- laying it out from
          memory as best he can.
          He GLANCES at the clock as it ticks toward DA
          As Charlie plots, he talks to Jane -- his silent confidante.

<b>                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>          Those rooms upstairs, that's
          probably where he's got Amy.
          I get her out, assuming she's--

<b>                         (NOT DEAD)
</b>          Then I have to get him on the
          ropes.
          He thinks... Then looks up, an idea occurring. Jane lies
          there peacefully.

<b>                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>          I have to go.
          More energized, Charlie stands and gathers his things.
          He stops, contemplates his mother for a moment -- regretful.

<b>                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>          I'm coming back for you, Mom.

<b>          INT. ARMY/NAVY STORE -- DAY
</b>
          Charlie buys FIREPROOF CLOTHING, a small open-flame lighter,
          and a SPRAY CANISTER like the kind an exterminator uses.
          The guy at the counter looks Charlie up and down. Charlie
          takes this in. Finally, Charlie's like -- fuck it.

<b>                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>          Going to kill a vampire.
          The guy looks at him. Then--

<b>                         STORE GUY
</b>          Good for you.
          The store guy waits. Charlie hands over his money.

<b>          EXT. JERRY'S HOUSE - DAY

<b>          ON JERRY'S HOUSE
</b>          LOOMING, silhouetted against early morning light. Next to
          it, Charlie's house stands in charred ruins.
          CHARLIE stands on the front lawn, contemplating the houses.
          He wears fireproof clothes, has stakes and crosses strapped
          to him, holsters made out of duct-tape...
          Slung over his shoulder is the spray canister. And he holds
          a crowbar in a free hand. He looks like something out of one
          of Ed's graphic novels.
          Before he enters, Charlie DOUSES HIMSELF IN HOLY WATER.

<b>                         CHARLIE

          He swallows hard, scared but determined.

</b>

<b>          CLOSE ON WET FOOTPRINTS
</b>          Widen to find Charlie cautiously moving through the house.
          The blacked-out windows give the place a gray, stifled air.
          Behind Charlie, we see that the front door has been broken
          open with the crow bar.

</b>          Charlie anxiously looks around for Jerry -- fully expecting
          him to jump out and go for his throat...
          He takes the stairs up to the second floor, two at a time.

<b>          INT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- DAY
</b>
          Charlie moves down the hall, stops at some of the small
          rooms. Looks in.

<b>                         NO AMY
</b>          Finally, Charlie hears a GROAN. He opens a window in the
          door for yet another room.
          AMY'S lying on the floor, turned away from him. Charlie's
          not sure what he'll see when he gets a better look at her.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>
<b>                         AMY--
</b>          Amy slowwwwly gets up, turns...
          And aside from a BRUISED BITE MARK on her neck -- she looks
          normal. She rushes to Charlie, keeps her voice down.

<b>                         AMY
</b>
<b>                         CHARLIE--
</b>          She reaches through the window. They link hands, emotional.

<b>                         AMY (CONT'D)
</b>          You shouldn't be here--

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Where is he?

<b>                         AMY
</b>          I don't know. He dumped me here.
          I'm bait. He said so--

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          How do you feel?

<b>                         AMY
</b>          I'll survive. Please get out of
          here. He's too strong--

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          I'm stronger.

<b>                         (WAVERING)

<b>                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>          Take this. It should--
          He looks up. AMY IS GONE. Disappeared.
          Charlie, reacts. Calls out in a hushed panic--

<b>                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>          Amy? Amy!?
          Nothing. It's like she vaporized.

<b>          INT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- HALLWAY -- DAY
</b>
          Charlie races down a hallway, looking for ANY.
          He tries door after door that won't open.
          He finally finds one door that's unlocked, rushes through --
          almost FALLS through an open floor in an unfinished portion
          of the house.
          Jerry's building more cells.
          Charlie backs out of the doorway, turns a corner and BAM!
          He runs into JERRY. No, wait -- it's PETER.
          He's not wearing his wig, etc. But he's cleaned up and
          standing tall. Dressed all in black.

<b>                         CHARLIE

          A beat. Then:

<b>                         PETER
</b>          Guess I don't want to be a man like
          me either.
          Peter opens his leather coat -- it's loaded with weapons.
          And a flask. Peter grins.

<b>                         PETER (CONT'D)

          From around his back, he reveals A DOUBLE-BARRELLED SHOTGUN
          with a CROSS MOUNTED ON THE BARREL.

<b>                         CHARLIE

          Bullet, bullets. They'll buy us
          some time.
          Charlie is grateful, but now's not the time for man hugs.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          We have to find Amy. She was in a
          room upstairs, then she just
          disappeared. This house--

<b>                         PETER
</b>          What do you mean she "disappeared?"

<b>                         CHARLIE

</b>
          Peter and Charlie pry open the door to the room where Amy was
          held. Peter walks over the floor -- finds a TRAP DOOR.

<b>                         PETER (CONT'D)
</b>          Floor trap. I use it all the time.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Where does it go?

<b>                         PETER
</b>          Only one way to find out.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          99.
</b>          Peter lowers himself into the hole under the trap door--

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Wait -- you're going in?

<b>                         PETER
</b>          See that? Like a great date. Get
          me drunk and I'll try anything.
          Peter lets go and FALLS. Charlie steels himself, goes in
          after him.

<b>          INT. JERRY'S BASEMENT -- DAY
</b>
          THUD! Charlie and Peter land painfully on a dirt floor.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          Ow, crap...
          They look around -- eyes adjusting. There's barely any
          light.
          They're in a LARGE UNFINISHED BASEMENT. The floor is dirt
          and the main story of the house is held up by numerous

<b>          SUPPORT POSTS.
</b>          At the far end of the basement there is a door that leads to
          another room/storage area.

<b>                         ON CHARLIE
</b>          As he sees something. Stops.
          A MOUND of dirt. Like a grave.
          Charlie indicates to Peter to follow him. They whisper:

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          You uncover him. I'll light him
          up, then stake him.
          Charlie pulls a FABRIC MASK, like a ski mask, over his face.
          Peter looks at him.

<b>                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>          Flame retardant.
          They're standing over the grave now. Both nervous.
          Charlie nods to Peter. Peter does his best to hold the
          shotgun on the grave as he pushes the dirt aside with his
          free hand. He's shaking.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          100.
</b>          After a moment Peter UNCOVERS PART OF THE BODY. Then he
          moves up toward the face...
          Charlie douses the body with liquid from the canister.

<b>                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)

<b>                         (TO PETER)
</b>          Gas.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          You should be a magician.
          As the face emerges, Charlie readies a match, then reaches
          for his STAKE--

<b>                         PETER (CONT'D)
</b>          Stop! No--
          CHARLIE stops JUST AS HE'S ABOUT TO TOSS the match.

<b>                         PETER (CONT'D)
</b>          Who is that?
          IT'S ADAM, sleeping in a shallow dirt grave.
          Charlie reacts. Holy shit. He pushes his mask back.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Adam. I know him. Knew him.

<b>                         PETER

</b>          Peter stops. He's looking over Charlie's shoulder,
          horrified.
          In the dirt behind CHARLIE are MORE GRAVES. Eight or ten at
          least. Charlie turns. Sees the graves.

<b>                         PETER (CONT'D)
</b>          You know them too?
          Charlie reacts, stunned.
          Peter moves to another grave, uncovers another sleeping face.
          And then another. A hulking man, a suburban mom...
          Charlie uncovers another body. Stops, chilled.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Ms. Granada. My geometry teacher.

<b>                         (RUEFUL)

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>
<b>                         (IGNORING HIM)
</b>          We can't burn Jerry out. There's
          no way we'll get all these people
          out if the house goes up.

<b>                         PETER

          (off Charlie's look)
          Great. Right. Save the Geometry--
          A SCREAM stops him. Amy. Charlie and Peter spin -- it's
          coming from behind the door to the other room. A beat.
          They're both petrified as they move toward the door.
          Peter readies the gun again. Charlie pulls a CROSS out along
          with the stake.
          They creep toward the door.

<b>          CLOSE ON CHARLIE

          Charlie hits the dirt hard.
          The door SLAMS SHUT AND LOCKS BEHIND HIM. He's in a smaller
          room with a LARGE DIRT GRAVE in the middle. Jerry's grave.

<b>          INT. JERRY'S BASEMENT -- DAY
</b>
          Peter's confronted by JERRY. Who smiles darkly.

<b>                         JERRY

          Charlie reacts to the blast -- but sees that ST. MICHAEL'S
          STAKE has fallen from his hand and rolled to the edge of the
          grave.
          He cautiously moves to retrieve it...
          He stops as he sees A FIGURE emerge from the dark. AMY.
          Her clothes are torn now, a thin trickle of blood runs down
          her neck. She looks impossibly sexy. Her hair, her eyes,
          her lips -- all shining and full.
          Forgetting himself, he goes to her. Pulls her into his arms.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Amy, God...
          She clings to him, near tears.

          Peter scrambles on the ground, SHOTGUN trained on JERRY --
          who moves toward him calmly. The cross on the gun the only
          thing holding him back.

<b>          BLAM!
</b>          Peter fires again -- grazes JERRY.

<b>                         JERRY

</b>          It's not too late.
          She brings her lips close to his ear. Rasps...

</b>          It is. He's inside me now.
          Her EYES GO DARK -- fingernails grow SHARP and dig into

</b>
          JERRY, backed by ADAM, MS. GRANADA and a handful of other
          vampires, closes in on PETER.

<b>                         JERRY

          Desperate, he BLASTS them again. Hits one on the shoulder.

          Jerry and the others stop. What?

          Amy and Charlie struggle. He reaches for his cross -- but
          she throws him off her with a violent HISS.
          Charlie gets his first look at AMY in full VAMPIRE glory.
          She's even more freaky looking than Jerry or Ed. Her face is
          nearly overtaken by a wide mouth filled with razor-sharp
          teeth. Her eyes are crazed and blood-red.
          It's gruesome and terrifying.
          Charlie sees THE STAKE at the lip of the hole. Dives for it.
          Amy's on him in a flash. She throws him to the ground. He's
          got the STAKE in hand. Ready to strike.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          You wouldn't.

</b>          Try me.
          She STRADDLES HIM, sexual and raw. Charlie's repulsed,
          terrified.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          I'll be the best you ever had. The

          She leans in, licks his neck seductively...

<b>          AND GASPS.
</b>          She sits back, the STAKE IN HER CHEST. She falls away,
          shuddering.
          Charlie pulls the stake out -- scrambles out of the nest.
          He looks back at her, anguished.
          A beat. AMY, in terrible pain, LAUGHS. Nothing's happening.
          No kablooey.

<b>                         AMY (CONT'D)

          The basement where Jerry and the THE TRIBE are CIRCLED around
          a body as MS. GRANADA feeds.
          ON PETER, who's pale and shaking...
          Charlie attacks them with THE CROWBAR.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Get off him!
          He hits MS. GRANADA off Peter. Manages to hold off JERRY for
          a beat. Spins and HITS ADAM in the head.

<b>                         ADAM
</b>          Dude!

          AMY enters from the other room -- already healing. Jerry
          sees her -- holds up a hand and backs the others off.

</b>          I'll finish this.
          Jerry, all swagger, moves in on Charlie.
          Charlie sees Peter, barely alive, spit out his FAKE VAMP
          teeth. Peter meets his gaze, wry and weak. Done for.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          Worth a shot. "Master of
          illusion."
          Now Charlie notices SHOTGUN not far from Peter's body. He
          dives for it, but Jerry steps on it -- kicks it away.

          Jerry brutally kicks Charlie, sends him sprawling.

</b>          Charlie, enraged, SPRAYS JERRY WITH GAS FROM the CANISTER --

          Jerry recoils, HISSING. Adam and the OTHER VAMPS MOVE IN.
          Jerry's over it. He's on CHARLIE in a flash, FANGS BARED.
          About to RIP HIS NECK OUT.

<b>                         AMY (CONT'D)
</b>          Charlie...
          Amy starts to cry. Peter looks on, concerned. Finally,
          Charlie opens his eyes. Says weakly...

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Blow me? Seriously?
          Peter falls back -- exhausted. Laughing.

<b>                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>          Those are his last words? What a
          tool.
          We pull away, leaving this tableau...
          UNTIL ADAM, MS. GRANADA and the OTHER MEMBERS of the tribe
          emerge from the rubble. Disoriented, freaked.
          A beat.

<b>          MS. GRANADA
</b>          Let's agree to never talk about
          this.

<b>                         FADE TO:
</b>
<b>          INT. PETER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
          Charlie, Amy, Jane and Peter are in Peter's penthouse. It's
          a glittering night, a spectacular view.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          110.
</b>          Jane, released from the hospital, looks healthy and glowing.
          She smiles at Peter, who also looks more together.
          She has a glass of wine -- he's drinking a COKE.

<b>                         JANE
</b>          Think you'll ever feel the same
          about a nighttime sky?

<b>                         PETER
</b>          Same as what? I was always
          terrified.

<b>                         JANE
</b>          Right. We're just catching up.

<b>          ON AMY AND CHARLIE
</b>          Charlie sees the connection between Peter and Jane.
          Shudders.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          I'm not seeing that.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          She deserves some fun. Your mom
          fully cheated death.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>
<b>                         (SUGGESTIVE)
</b>          You too. You deserve fun.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          Oh, I plan on it. Now that you've
          killed your first vampire...

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          I am so going to perform.
          Charlie KISSES her. It's intense, passionate. It's
          different, they're different. The childish part of them long
          gone.
          He runs his hands through her hair, pulls her close.
          SOMETHING BEEPS, talks...

<b>                         VOICE
</b>          "Frak!" "Frak!"

<b>                         AMY
</b>
<b>                         (PULLS BACK)
</b>          What is that?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Charlie, a little sheepish, shows her. He's wearing a
          BATTLESTAR GALACTICA wrist watch.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Battlestar.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          Right.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          It was Ed's.
          Amy smiles a little, softens.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          Right.

<b>                         (THEN)
</b>          Frak?
          PETER is passing. Hears this. Is down with it.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          Frak! Right on.

<b>                         (TO AMY)
</b>          Perfect Woman, can I get you a
          drink?

<b>                         AMY
</b>          I'll take another. Thanks.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>
<b>                         (TO PETER)
</b>          I'll give you a hand.
          Charlie follows PETER into the DINING ROOM, where a BAR CART
          is set up. Peter moves to it. Pours himself a Midori.

<b>                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>          I thought you were on the wagon.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          It's dark.
          (off his look)
          I'm on the "day" wagon.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Thanks for inviting us.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          We should celebrate. Being alive.
          Your mom's clean bill of health.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          You wanted to put the moves on her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>                         112
</b>
<b>                         PETER
</b>          What? No. What?

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Just -- I'm watching you. I've got
          to look out for her.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          Yeah you do. So here's what I'm
          thinking. We faced the beast and
          we won. Can you imagine the
          possibilities if we had got that
          shit on film?

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>
<b>                         VAMPIRES DON'T--
</b>
<b>                         PETER
</b>          Show up on film, yeah. But
          werewolves do, bigfoots do. We get
          proof, catch something -- we could
          build a stage act around that, you
          wouldn't believe. We'd blow those
          Cirque bitches away!

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          An act? Seriously? What about
          saving people from evil? What

<b>                         ABOUT--
</b>          A CHILLING LAUGH interrupts them. Distant. Eerie. And
          somehow familiar.
          Peter nods to his COLLECTION CABINETS.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          It happens. All this stuff...

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Ever think about collecting
          something else? Snow globes or--
          Charlie stops, catches sight of something MOVING IN THE

<b>          REFLECTION ON THE FLOOR-TO-CEILING WINDOW.
</b>          Just a wisp, a phantom. The face - is it ED? His features
          twisted in a grimace of fear and pain... It's CHILLING.
          Charlie's spooked. But he looks again and the face is gone.

<b>                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>          Yeah, definitely get new stuff.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          113.
</b>          Peter leads CHARLIE OUT, back to the ladies in the other
          room. Still on about his idea...

<b>          WE HOLD ON THEIR REFLECTION IN THE WINDOW
</b>
<b>          PETER (O.S.)
</b>          I'm serious, man. Do you know how
          much we could make? Think about
          how much people pay to see a tiger,
          or boobs, right? What if we had a
          tiger, boobs -- and a zombie!
          After they've gone we linger on the window. Is that Ed's
          eerie reflection again?, barely visible...

<b>          AS WE GO TO BLACK
</b>
<b>          ED (0.S.)
</b>          You're so coooool Brewster!!

<b>                         THE END
</b>
