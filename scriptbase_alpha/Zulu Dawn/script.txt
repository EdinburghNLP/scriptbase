               SCRIPT APPEARS ON BLACK SCREEN:

               One hundred years ago the British Colony of Natal in Southern 
               Africa was surrounded by a vast and independent Zulu Kingdom.

               In 1879, a battle took place that was forever to alter the 
               course of colonial history: ISANDHLWANA.

               EXT. DAWN.

               Four Zulu's are seen in silhouette herding cattle up a hill.

               LONG SHOT - Two Zulu's are seen in silhouette high on a 
               precipice.

               Seven Zulu's are seen walking in silhouette against the 
               sunrise.

               The sun fills the screen as the sound of many running feet 
               and Zulu drums are heard.

               EXT. ZULU KRAAL. DAY

               A large regiment of Zulu warriors carrying shields and 
               assegais (stabbing spears) are seen running into the Kraal 
               whilst the sound of tribal singing, chanting and drum beating 
               escalates.

               Inside the camp a group of Zulu's are seen grappling with a 
               bull as they struggle to bring the animal to the ground. 
               They are watched by a vast circle of warriors all shouting 
               encouragement.

               An elaborate tribal dance ensues. It appears to be some sort 
               of Fertility Rite. The females stand opposite the men in 
               rows, chanting as they move in closer.

               CETSHWAYO, the great Zulu King emerges into the throng. He 
               is tall, beautifully fat, with a big intelligent face and 
               superb dignity. He surveys his subjects with interest as 
               they stand unanimous, thrusting their assegais into the air 
               whilst shouting their allegiance.

               EXT. HIGH COMMISSIONER'S RESIDENCE, PIETERMARITZBURG, NATAL. 
               NIGHT

                                     BARTLE FRERE (V.O.)
                              (Reading aloud the 
                              letter)

                                     BARTLE FRERE (V.O.)
                              (he has just written)
                         Cetshwayo's Zulu army to disband and 
                         the warriors permitted to return to 
                         their homes.

               SWITCH TO INTERIOR. FRERE is seated at his desk whilst LORD 
               CHELMSFORD is seen in the background standing on the veranda.

                                     BARTLE FRERE
                              (He continues to read 
                              aloud)
                         Present military system to be 
                         abandoned. New regulations concerning 
                         the defence of the realm worked out.

               CHELMSFORD enters the room, sits and studies two sheets of 
               paper.

               Frere continues:

                                     BARTLE FRERE
                         All who do not submit will be dealt 
                         with as enemies of the Crown. We 
                         will not permit the arbitrary killing 
                         and
                              (FRERE pauses as he 
                              underlines a certain 
                              word)
                         and unjust oppression which the Zulu 
                         people have suffered from their own 
                         King Cetshwayo...

               Pausing, FRERE looks up as if to meet his comrade's gaze. 
               CHELMSFORD, however, continues to read, turning the page.

                                     BARTLE FRERE
                         You'll see from the letter that this 
                         ultimatum is our decision alone. Her 
                         Majesty's government seems to prefer 
                         a negotiated settlement.

               CLOSE UP of CHELMSFORD's letter:

                                     BARTLE FRERE
                         Her Majesty's government 
                         confidentially hope that by the 
                         exercise of prudence and by meeting 
                         of the Zulus in a spirit of 
                         forbearance and reasonable compromise 
                         it will be possible to avert the 
                         very serious evil of a war with 
                         Cetshwayo.

               Return to BARTLE FRERE. As he melts some sealing wax over a 
               silver burner:

                                     BARTLE FRERE
                              (Referring to the 
                              letter he has just 
                              completed)
                         Does this do what we both know to be 
                         right Frederick?

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         It does Sir Henry,
                              (He folds the papers 
                              neatly in half)
                         excellently.

               The pair exchange glances as BARTLE FRERE applies the wax to 
               his letter.

               CLOSE UP of stamped seal.

               EXT. CHELMSFORD'S CAMP PIETERMARITZBURG. DAY

               Activity everywhere, the incessant movement of an army in 
               the final stages of its formation. Huge ox-wagons are being 
               hauled into the camp.

               CHELMSFORD and CREALOCK are on horseback in full regalia as 
               they ride into the centre of the Camp.

               Squads of Basuto-infantry -- tall, rangy bodies, naked except 
               for a loincloth and neck ornaments -- are being drilled by 
               foul mouthed, bullying European NCO's.

               LT. MELVILL, young, dapper, inspects the Martini Henry rifles 
               of a company of REDCOATS who are lined up near the BASUTOS. 
               A CSM (SGT. WILLIAMS) stalks behind MELVILL.

               ONE REDCOAT, young, thin, gangling, turns his head slightly 
               to peek at the Basutos, and the swift eye of SGT. WILLIAMS 
               detects the disaffection. The young redcoat (PTE. WILLIAMS) 
               turns, guilty at being caught out of the 'Attention' position. 
               The CSM (SGT. WILLIAMS) leans forward until his face is one 
               inch from that of his quavering prey.

                                     SGT. WILLIAMS
                              (Shouting)
                         You moved.
                              (With more restraint)
                         You moved. Go and tell the NCO of 
                         that black shambles that you love 
                         'im more than you love me.
                              (Shouting)
                         NOW!

               PTE. WILLIAMS blinks, swallows then runs over to the Basuto's 
               NCO.

                                     NCO
                              (Addressing the Basutos)
                         You're not fit to be in the British 
                         army you different coloured articles. 
                         STRAIGHTEN UP! You're like a load of 
                         bloody herd boys!
                              (He suddenly becomes 
                              aware of PTE. 
                              WILLIAMS' presence)

                                     PTE. WILLIAMS
                         I'm to tell you Corporal, that I 
                         love you more than my Colour Sergeant.

               The Basuto's NCO walks up to PTE. WILLIAMS.

                                     NCO
                         That's frightening... Get out of my 
                         bloody sight lad. And put your rifle 
                         over your head and double round this 
                         field
                              (shouting)
                         until you drop bloody dead. Now move, 
                         get on with it, at the double.

               The Basutos, laughing, raise their shields into the air in 
               general amusement as PRIVATE WILLIAMS runs past.

                                     NCO
                         Shut up! Get back in the ranks you 
                         shower of animals.

               CHELMSFORD, still on horseback, surveys the encampment. He 
               salutes to SGT. WILLIAMS. CREALOCK, as always, is in 
               attendance.

                                     SGT. WILLIAMS
                              (Facing the ranks)
                         Company Shoulder arms...
                              (LT. MELVILL joins 
                              SGT. WILLIAMS)
                         Present arms.

               LT. MELVILL turns standing to attention, saluting as 
               CHELMSFORD passes.

               Two BOERS ride into the camp, passing two SUTLERS wagons. We 
               see SGT. WILLIAMS' dismissed COMPANY hurriedly crowding round 
               one of the SUTLER'S wagons, shouting for cigars and gin.

               The two BOERS, one an elderly man, one a boy of sixteen, 
               have dismounted. SGT. WILLIAMS strides over to them.

                                     SGT. WILLIAMS
                         You passing through?

                                     ELDERLY BOER
                         We've come to fight the Zulu.

                                     SGT. WILLIAMS
                         We aren't at war yet.
                              (Referring to the boy)
                         Bit young 'in he?

                                     ELDERLY BOER
                         He's my nephew... he can shoot, track 
                         and speak Zulu and fight like hell... 
                         he's got Assegai marks to prove it...

               He gestures to the boy to show SGT. WILLIAMS. The YOUNG BOER 
               pulls up his shirt, showing an horrendous white scar across 
               his stomach. SGT. WILLIAMS stares in amazement. Coming to, 
               commanding the attention of a BOY-PULLEN in the ranks.

                                     SGT. WILLIAMS
                         You!

                                     BOY-PULLEN
                         Sir.
                              (Running over)

                                     SGT. WILLIAMS
                         Take 'em to the orderly officer.

               SGT. WILLIAMS departs.

                                     BOY-PULLEN
                              (Standing to attention -- 
                              Addressing the BOERS)
                         This way.

               The BOERS follow as the PTE. leads off.

               A TROOP OF SIKALI HORSE under the command of COL. DURNFORD 
               ride into the camp. He is a tall, thin-haired man with 
               handsome sunburnt features, intelligent and sensitive eyes 
               and an over-length moustache. He has only the use of one 
               arm, his left arm being completely paralyzed and held 
               immobile, tucked into a special pocket he has sewn into his 
               tunic. COL. DURNFORD and SGT. MAJOR KAMBULA (A powerful and 
               intelligent African radiating authority) pull up as the troop 
               ride by.

               With the SIKALI in the foreground, PTE. WILLIAMS is seen in 
               the background, still running, his rifle above his head.

               The same NCO seen previously addresses the BASUTOS:

                                     NCO
                         Company... 'Shun!
                              (The BASUTOS comply)
                         Move yourselves.

               SIKALI are seen cantering as if a pre-ordained manoeuvre is 
               about to commence.

               DURNFORD and S.M. KAMBULA are surveying their troops.

                                     S.M. KAMBULA
                         Shall I give the order Sir?

                                     COL. DURNFORD
                         Alright, Sergeant.

               S.M. KAMBULA rides offscreen.

               The SIKALI gather together. S.M. KAMBULA's voice is heard 
               above the throng:

                                     S.M. KAMBULA
                         Sikali Horse Forward!

               The SIKALI ride full pelt, charging at the BASUTOS.

               The troop continues almost into the first line of the BASUTOS, 
               which consists of their European NCO's.

               The European NCO's of the BASUTOS stare at the SIKALI troop 
               as they wheel and once again come galloping at them.

               COL. PULLEINE, LT. MELVILL & LT. COGHILL are seen outside 
               the Officer's Mess amused at the commotion.

               CLOSE UP. COL. DURNFORD laughing.

               The NCO's edge away, unsure, prepared to take to their heels. 
               The BASUTO infantry watch, admiring, clapping.

               The troop skillfully turns their horses, as if on a penny, 
               inches from the BASUTO NCO's then ride away, whooping, in 
               high spirits.

               LORD CHELMSFORD & COL. CREALOCK, having watched this 
               exhibition, ride forward to meet COL. DURNFORD.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         Splendid horsemanship. Who are they?

                                     DURNFORD
                         Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians 
                         all. I know each one by name.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         They come well recommended do they?

                                     DURNFORD
                         My Lord, they rode for me at Bushman's 
                         Pass.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         Oh... indeed. Crealock, we should 
                         see that Colonel Durnford has an 
                         Officer for his hard riders. Perhaps 
                         a subaltern from the Twenty Fourth.

                                     DURNFORD
                         I thought it might be more effective 
                         to find someone who speaks Zulu.

               CHELMSFORD & CREALOCK exchange glances.

                                     CREALOCK
                         Yes. I see you've issued each of 
                         them with a Martini Henry Carbine. 
                         Our quota for Native contingencies: 
                         one rifle to ten men and only five 
                         rounds per rifle.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         But will they make good use of them?

                                     DURNFORD
                         They're as good marksmen as horsemen.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         There's no doubting their horsemanship 
                         Colonel Durnford.

               CHELMSFORD & DURNFORD salute.

                                     DURNFORD
                         Mr. Crealock.

               CREALOCK nods.

               DURNFORD exits offscreen.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         We must think how to make best use 
                         of Colonel Durnford's African 
                         knowledge.

               Through the smoke of the field kitchens enters the Honourable 
               WILLIAM VEREKER, aristocratically aloof on a fine stallion, 
               his servant following on an equally fine horse. He rides 
               purposely towards COL. DURNFORD as if he has been seeking 
               him.

                                     VEREKER
                         Colonel Durnford... William Vereker. 
                         I hear you've been seeking Officers?

                                     DURNFORD
                         Good ones, yes, Mr Vereker. Gentlemen 
                         who can ride and shoot.

               DURNFORD waits for a reaction. VEREKER, cool, looks into 
               DURNFORD's face and takes out his rifle. Cantering some 
               distance away, VEREKER turns, spurs his horse vigorously 
               and, on reaching DURNFORD, throws his rifle up into the aim. 
               He fires one-handed at the half carcass of a cow being hung 
               up near the field kitchens without veering his galloping 
               horse. The half carcass shudders under the impact of the 
               heavy bullet.

               PTE. WILLIAMS has been jogging wretchedly on. On hearing the 
               bullet he throws himself to the ground believing he has been 
               shot. Two of the kitchen hands help him to his feet.

               CLOSE UP of SGT. WILLIAMS.

                                     SGT. WILLIAMS
                              (Shouting across the 
                              field)
                         Private Williams. You've stopped.

               PTE. WILLIAMS regains his composure and, once more lifting 
               his rifle above his head, continues to jog. SGT. WILLIAMS 
               looks on with smug satisfaction.

               As VEREKER approaches, DURNFORD commands the attention of 
               LT. RAW.

                                     DURNFORD
                         Mr. Raw. Take Mr. Vereker to the 
                         Store and see he's issued the 
                         necessary equipment. And then show 
                         him to the Mess and explain to him 
                         how an Officer is expected to behave.

               RAW salutes and leads VEREKER off left, as DURNFORD watches 
               their departure.

               INT. OFFICERS' MESS TENT. DAY

               CLOSE UP. A scorpion is being removed from a specimen jar 
               with a pair of tweezers. It is lifted out of shot to be 
               examined under a magnifying glass revealing LIEUTENANTS 
               COGHILL & MELVILL seated at an impressive green baize table.

               There are African servants, white-jacketed. SERGEANT MURPHY, 
               a short, broad humorous, coarse-faced man, supervises the 
               servants.

               CHELMSFORD sits alone at a corner table reading his newspaper.

               Other Officers are seated around the main table drinking 
               claret and smoking the obligatory cigars. COLONEL PULLEINE 
               is writing a letter whilst LT. HARFORD sits with his tins 
               around him classifying his specimens.

               As SGT. MURPHY refills their glasses COGHILL & MELVILL gossip 
               covertly in half whispers so that their voices don't carry 
               to the table of their commander.

                                     MELVILL
                              (Lighting COGHILL'S 
                              cigar)
                         Our good Colonel Durnford scored 
                         quite a coup with the Sikali Horse.

                                     COGHILL
                         Um. There are rumours that my Lord 
                         Chelmsford intends to make Durnford 
                         Second in Command.

                                     MELVILL
                         Well that's typical of Her Majesty's 
                         army. Appoint an engineer to do a 
                         soldier's work.

                                     PULLEINE
                              (He continues writing 
                              without looking up)
                         Now, now Mr. Melvill, less of your 
                         spleen.

               COGHILL & MELVILL smile at one another before their attention 
               is drawn to LT. RAW and VEREKER entering the Mess.

                                     RAW
                              (Addressing the Mess)
                         Stranger in the Mess, gentlemen.
                              (To CHELMSFORD)
                         My Lord.

               The officers and Vereker survey each other.

                                     RAW
                              (To VEREKER)
                         Announce yourself.

               VEREKER spots CHELMSFORD in the corner.

                                     VEREKER
                         Good day Frederick.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         Good day William.
                              (Folding his newspaper, 
                              he stands to shake 
                              hands)
                         Pleased you could join us.

               The OFFICERS turn, a bit startled, to look at this newcomer 
               who is somehow on first-name terms with the Lord General.

                                     VEREKER
                         It was either that, or join the Zulu.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                              (Removing his glasses)
                         Join the Zulu? Oh yes, you're right 
                         in the thick of it aren't you? Talked 
                         to your father before we sailed... 
                         he said you'd taken to farming near 
                         Zulu land. Sent his regards... Should 
                         I meet up with you.

                                     VEREKER
                              (Wryly)
                         That was nice of the old boy.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         I think you'd better call out who 
                         you are.

               VEREKER turns to address the Mess. CHELMSFORD sits.

                                     VEREKER
                         William Vereker.

                         Pulleine. Messers. Melvill, Coghill...

               With the exception of PULLEINE & MAJOR RUSSELL the Officers 
               stand as they are introduced.

                                     COGHILL
                         Morning.

               During the introductions, SGT. MURPHY selects a large, silver, 
               chalice-like receptacle from a trophy table in another corner. 
               He takes it to the head of the table.

                         Harford... and Harford's best friend.

               HARFORD raises a glass jar containing one of his prized 
               specimens in acknowledgement. Meanwhile MURPHY has collected 
               a bottle of claret from a tray brought by another black 
               servant. He pours the contents into the trophy.

                                     RUSSELL
                         Don't leave your gin around, Vereker, 
                         or Harford will have it full of 
                         preserved butterflies. A damned waste, 
                         if you ask me.

               HARFORD chuckles as he replaces the lid on his jar.

                                     VEREKER
                         Oh, I doubt if I'll leave much of 
                         that around. There's quite a shortage 
                         where I've been.

                         You didn't really have to chose 
                         between your country and the Zulu 
                         did you?

               VEREKER begins to drink. Gradually, the officers join in 
               with cheers of encouragement until the entire Mess is chanting 
               "Down, down, down". They bang their fists on the table in 
               time with the chants.

               Gulping back the liquid, VEREKER stops as if he has 
               accomplished his task. The Officers applaud. General ad.

                                     OFFICERS
                         The Regiment.

                                     VEREKER
                              (Still smiling, he 
                              wipes the remaining 
                              wine from the corners 
                              of his moustache)
                         The Regiment.

               EXT. ZULUKRAAL. DAY

               A tall, bald imposing Zulu named MANTSHONGA enters the camp. 
               He makes his way through a large regiment of young Zulu braves 
               and older INDUNAS (officers). They surround two young Zulu 
               warriors who are tautly circling. Their shields are held at 
               the defensive, their assegais poised for underhand thrust.

               CLOSE SHOT - The two warriors fighting.

               LONG SHOT - The vast crowd encircling the warriors.

               The crowd cheers as CHIEF CETSHWAYO watches from his throne.

               MANTSHONGA, spotting CETSHWAYO, walks purposefully towards 
               him.

                                     MANTSHONGA
                         I bring greetings from your friends, 
                         the British, and from the Great Lord 
                         Chelmsford.

                                     CETSHWAYO
                              (Still watching the 
                              fighting Zulus)
                         And what do your Masters say?

                                     MANTSHONGA
                         They are angry and send these demands. 
                         They say you rule in old ways that 
                         are wrong, that you kill your people 
                         without trial. The Great White Queen 
                         herself cannot kill her lowliest 
                         subject though she rules forty lands, 
                         each greater than all of Zululand.

                                     BAYELE
                         Kill the Traitor, Father!

                                     CETSHWAYO
                              (Gesturing to his son 
                              to calm down)
                         I do kill, under the customs of the 
                         Zulu, and I shall not depart from 
                         that. Do I go to the country of the 
                         white man and tell him to change his 
                         laws and customs?

                                     MANTSHONGA
                         The British say your armies grow 
                         larger and they demand that you 
                         disband your Impis of War.

                                     CETSHWAYO
                         Tell the British I will not cross 
                         the river which divides our lands. 
                         But ask Lord Chelmsford if he would 
                         disarm his warriors in the face of 
                         such threats.

               CLOSE UP. The two Zulus are now in ferocious combat.

               SWITCH back to alternate CLOSE shots of CETSHWAYO & 
               MANTSHONGA.

                                     MANTSHONGA
                         I will ask him, but his answer will 
                         be to start war against your 30,000 
                         warriors.

                                     CETSHWAYO
                         My armies will defend this land.

               General uproar as one of the fighting Zulus falls to the 
               ground. Standing, CETSHWAYO gives the signal to kill. The 
               triumphant Zulu drives his assegai into the other's heart. A 
               group of warriors converge upon the body as MANTSHONGA turns 
               and EXITS.

               EXT. GARDEN. DIOCESAN MANSION. DAY

               A garden party is in full swing. There are tables and chairs 
               dotted about a spacious garden. Stringed music is playing 
               and there is an air of English civility. There are ladies 
               with parasols, children playing and Officers present.

               FANNY COLENSO -- 25, her cheeks aflame, her manner excitable, 
               is engaged in a sedate game of cricket with some children 
               and officers. She bats the ball some distance away near COL. 
               DURNFORD.

                                     FANNY
                         Anthony...
                              (Shouting)
                         Anthony.

               COL. DURNFORD, engaged in conversation with an Officer and a 
               lady, turns on hearing his name. He spots the ball.

                                     COL. DURNFORD
                              (Handing his hat to 
                              the Officer)
                         Hold this.

               Picking up the ball, he gives it to a little girl who has 
               run to collect it.

                                     COL. DURNFORD
                              (Smiling at FANNY)
                         Well batted. Well batted.

               FANNY curtsies in mock recognition. Her eyes flash to his 
               and we sense their secret feeling for each other.

               VEREKER & two other officers ride along the drive to the 
               mansion. Dismounting VEREKER hands the reigns of his horse 
               to a well-dressed black groomsman and steps forward extending 
               his hand in greeting to the black butler.

                                     VEREKER
                         Joseph, how are all the Colenso girls?

                                     JOSEPH
                         They are all in the garden, Sir. And 
                         they will be glad to see you, I'm 
                         sure.

               VEREKER walks down the slope of the lawn, past a young girl 
               on a swing, her maid is in attendance. Removing his hat, he 
               spots FANNY being bowled to by LT. MILNE. Creeping up behind 
               her, VEREKER indicates to MILNE to bowl high.

                                     VEREKER
                              (catching the ball 
                              MILNE has just bowled)
                         You tipped it! You tipped it! Out! 
                         Out!

                                     FANNY
                         I did not...
                              (Turning)
                         William.
                              (Hugging him)
                         You cheat, you.

                                     VEREKER
                         Me cheat? Same old Fanny.
                              (He kisses her on the 
                              cheek)

                                     FANNY
                              (With genuine affection)
                         Welcome. Welcome back.

               Taking his arm, FANNY & VEREKER walk across the lawn. VEREKER 
               throws the ball back to the cricketers.

               DURNFORD, still engaged in conversation, turns smiling. His 
               smile fades as he spots FANNY with VEREKER.

                                     DURNFORD
                         Excuse me, Ladies.

               Leaving them, he makes towards FANNY & VEREKER.

                                     FANNY
                         Did you get your farm going?

                                     VEREKER
                         Yes, I did.

                                     FANNY
                         Oh. How was it?

                                     VEREKER
                         I've never been so happy.

               Stopping, FANNY addresses him earnestly.

                                     FANNY
                         I'm sorry you had to leave.

               DURNFORD approaches them.

                                     DURNFORD
                         You've met the... Honourable William 
                         Vereker, I believe.

                                     FANNY
                         Yes Anthony, we were childhood 
                         friends.

                                     DURNFORD
                         Your childhood friend shot a dead 
                         cow at the gallop the other day.
                              (FANNY laughs)
                         He wasn't impressed.

               SWITCH TO MANSION VERANDA.

               CHELMSFORD watches the threesome as BARTLE FRERE approaches 
               him, puffing on a cigar.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         There is a Mrs. Durnford, is there?

                                     BARTLE FRERE
                         She exists... but er... nothing's 
                         been heard of her, the eight years 
                         Durnford's been in Africa.

                                     CREALOCK
                         Although much is spoken of her now, 
                         My Lord.

               These three walk along the veranda.

                                     BARTLE FRERE
                         I, er, recommended him to you... 
                         because he knows Africa so well.

                                     CREALOCK
                         Oh, indeed. His ability to recruit 
                         native contingents is proving 
                         invaluable to His Lordship.

                                     BARTLE FRERE
                         How do you rate him as a soldier?

                                     CREALOCK
                         It is widely held that he has great 
                         courage and he's an excellent 
                         engineer.

                                     BARTLE FRERE
                              (Walking down the 
                              veranda steps)
                         Shall we join the guests?

               The DEWITT sisters, both in their whites, are seen playing a 
               game of tennis. They are being watched by LTS. MELVILL & 
               COGHILL (They are both seated). One of the ladies moves off 
               court to fetch the ball that has gone out of play. She glances 
               up at COGHILL.

                                     COGHILL
                         Do you think she might be interested 
                         in someone?

                                     MELVILL
                         Which one?

                                     COGHILL
                         Well that one. The one who keeps 
                         looking at me.

                                     MELVILL
                         It could be you flatter yourself 
                         Coghill. It's that odd eye.

               Lt. Raw approaches.

                                     RAW
                              (Tongue-in-cheek)
                         They must have locked all the good 
                         ones up.

               BARTLE FRERE, CHELMSFORD & CREALOCK have now joined a 
               selection of the guests at some tables on the lawn for 
               afternoon tea.

                                     MRS. DEWITT
                         Ah, General.
                              (She curtsies. 
                              CHELMSFORD 
                              acknowledges)
                         Do you find our Border Country 
                         congenial, My Lord?

                                     CHELMSFORD
                              (Sitting)
                         The landscape, most congenial Ma'am,  
                         but the Border, vulnerable.

                                     MRS. PRETORIOUS
                              (Also sitting)
                         Do you really think Cetshwayo will 
                         attack us?

               DURNSFORD, VEREKER & FANNY have also joined the party.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         The intention of the Zulu Impis and 
                         their King concern me deeply, Ma'am.

                                     FANNY
                         Cetshwayo has no intention of 
                         attacking Natal, Mrs. Pretorious. 
                         Unless he's given no option. He has 
                         no quarrel with us.
                              (She sits)

                                     BARTLE FRERE
                              (Sitting next to FANNY)
                         It's very rare to meet a young lady 
                         interested in tactical matters, Miss 
                         Colenso. Is it not, Sir Henry, most 
                         rare?

                                     MR. PRETORIOUS
                         You are talking of a violent and 
                         murdering barbarian who commands an 
                         army of 30,000 warriors just across 
                         the river

                         My father has known and lived with 
                         the Zulus for many years.

                                     MR. PRETORIOUS
                         Cetshwayo massacred 20,000 of his 
                         own people to make himself King.

                                     COLENSO
                         The English Tudor Kings did no less. 
                         Much later in our nation's history, 
                         I might add, and the French much 
                         more recently.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         That may well be, Your Grace, but be 
                         that as it may, my duty is clear the 
                         defence of all this...
                              (indicating the 
                              surroundings)
                         Natal.

                                     COLENSO
                         Yes, well, it's difficult to stand 
                         against that position. If you speak 
                         only of...
                              (Leaning forward & 
                              looking him in the 
                              eye)
                         defence.

                                     MR. PRETORIOUS
                         And what does our good Colonel 
                         Durnford think?

                                     DURNFORD
                              (Walking around the 
                              tables to join VEREKER)
                         If the people of Natal wish to feel 
                         safe, let them persuade their husbands 
                         and sons to volunteer. We need both 
                         Officers and men.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         We do Colonel, good point.

                                     COLENSO
                         I cannot be brought to believe that 
                         Cetshwayo wants a war with Britain.

                                     BARTLE FRERE
                         Every Zulu is raised to be a warrior 
                         Without a war there'd be no Zulu 
                         nation.

                                     MRS. DEWITT
                         Nobody is really safe, are they Your 
                         Excellency?

               JOSEPH has appeared at BARTLE FRERE's side. He whispers 
               something into his ear.

                                     BARTLE FRERE
                         Mrs. Dewitt has four daughters, Henry, 
                         and I fear she feels for them all.

               VEREKER has wandered away from the tables. He is watching 
               MELVILL & COGHILL chatting to the two DEWITT girls who were 
               previously playing tennis.

                                     VEREKER
                         Your daughters may indeed be in some 
                         danger Mrs. Dewitt, but not at the 
                         moment from the Zulus, I fear.

               The parties' attention is drawn to the four on the lawn.

               CLOSE UP of MRS. DEWITT as she laughs politely.

               As the camera swings back to the four on the lawn we see 
               MANTSHONGA in the background. The camera follows him ending 
               in CLOSE UP as he strides forward to meet BARTLE FRERE. BARTLE 
               FRERE looks grave as if he is already aware of the news he 
               is about to hear.

               SWITCH, LONG SHOT to where BARTLE FRERE, CHELMSFORD, CREALOCK 
               & MANTSHONGA are now standing. BARTLE FRERE addresses the 
               entire garden party.

                                     BARTLE FRERE
                         Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, 
                         please.

               LONG SHOT of lawn. The guests move forward.

               The camera closes in on the four on the veranda. With one 
               arm behind his back, a cigar in his other hand, BARTLE FRERE 
               continues:

                                     BARTLE FRERE
                              (Slowly and 
                              deliberately)
                         I think I should inform you that I 
                         am obliged to issue a state of war 
                         between Her Majesty's Government and 
                         the Zulu King, Cetshwayo...

               SWITCH to CLOSE UP of VEREKER & COLENSO. General background 
               noises of dismay as BARTLE FRERE carries on.

                                     BARTLE FRERE
                         on his non compliance with the 
                         ultimatum made on him urging 
                         reformation...

               CLOSE UP of FANNY & DURNFORD. He drops his head, averting 
               her gaze.

               CLOSE UP of BARTLE FRERE. He continues:

                                     BARTLE FRERE
                         and redress for violations of British 
                         Sovereignty.

               The guests applaud as CHELMSFORD & BARTLE FRERE shake hands.

               CLOSE UP of FANNY & DURNFORD.

                                     FANNY
                         Why? Why do men think of nothing but 
                         killing?
                              (She touches his 
                              disabled arm lovingly)

               Tucking his hat under his arm, he looks into her eyes and 
               kisses her hand.

               Walking away, he replaces his hat and reaching the top of 
               the veranda steps, turns. They exchange desperate, painful 
               glances.

               CLOSE UP OF COLENSO

                                     COLENSO
                              (To himself)
                         This wonderful land we are privileged 
                         to share.
                              (Removing his glasses)
                         Dear God
                              (hanging his head)
                         there should be room for all of us.

               EXT. CHELMSFORD'S CAMP. PIETERMARITZBURG. NIGHT

               ASSORTED CLOSE SHOTS TO COVER THE MOVE TO RORKE'S DRIFT -- 
               WAGON WHEELS CREAKING AS THEY TAKE THE FIRST STRAIN OF 
               MOVEMENT, OXEN HOOVES STARTING FORWARD ON RUTTED DIRT 
               SURFACES, WAGONEERS FLICKING WHIPS, PACKS GOING ONTO BACKS 
               OF SOLDIERS, BARE FEET OF NATIVE LEVIES, OFFICERS MOUNTING, 
               THEN SIMILAR DETAILS TO SHOW RHYTHMIC FORWARD PROGRESS, 
               MARCHING, ROLLING DARK SILHOUETTED FORMS. TORCHES.

               THREE OFFICERS stand watching:

                                     OFFICER
                         There goes Number Two Company.

               Q.S.M. BLOOMFIELD CUTS ACROSS SHOT he is studying a list 
               attached to a clipboard. He is about to walk past a tent 
               when he hears a call of "I'll see yer" coming from within. 
               Suspecting gambling, he moves to investigate.

               Pulling back the tent flap reveals a group, including BOY-
               PULLEN playing a game of cards.

                                     BLOOMFIELD
                         Do I believe what me eyes see? The 
                         whole bleedin' Army movin' off to 
                         meet the murderin' heathen and what 
                         goes on in 'ere? A game of Brag.
                              (Sterner)
                         Brag?

                                     BOY-PULLEN
                              (Standing)
                         I'm sorry, Quartermaster.

                                     BLOOMFIELD
                         You'll be more sorrier still when 
                         the Zulu ask Lad... "What 'ave you 
                         got to offer me not to slit your 
                         gut?" and you say
                              (Pointing to the cards 
                              in BOY-PULLEN's hand)
                         ah, the Knave of Hearts, Sir, the 
                         Knave of Hearts.

               The rest of the group chuckle.

               Offering BOY-PULLEN a coin, BLOOMFIELD gives the order "Move!"

               Taking the coin BOY-PULLEN leaves the tent.

               SWITCH to BANDSTAND. A band is playing "Men Of Harlech". 
               CHELMSFORD & BARTLE FRERE move into CLOSE UP in foreground.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         For a savage as to a child, 
                         chastisement is sometimes a kindness.

                                     BARTLE FRERE
                         Let us hope then, that this will be 
                         the final solution to the Zulu 
                         problem.

               EXT. COLUMN ON THE MOVE. NIGHT

               BOY-PULLEN moves against the traffic towards the back of the 
               moving column. He passes squads of torchlighted marchers, 
               artillery units, riders, wagons, until he comes to the 
               SUTLER'S wagon.

               THREE SOLDIERS ENTER SHOT and surreptitiously help themselves 
               out of the back of the moving wagon. Noticing, BOY-PULLEN 
               seizes his chance and grabbing a bottle out one of the 
               soldier's hands, makes a dash for it.

                                     SOLDIER
                         'Ere! Come back 'ere you thievin' 
                         little beggar.

               MOVING SHOT. CHELMSFORD, on foot salutes an officer as 
               DURNFORD approaches from behind on horseback.

                                     DURNFORD
                              (Calling)
                         My Lord.
                              (CHELMSFORD turns.)
                         I've prepared a list of ideas for 
                         you to see.
                              (He removes a paper 
                              from his tunic)

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         Excellent. Thank you.
                              (He continues to walk 
                              away)
                         Give them to Crealock, would you?

                                     DURNFORD
                         My Lord.
                              (CHELMSFORD turns 
                              again)
                         This list was prepared for you. I 
                         don't think another can understand 
                         its true value.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                              (Taking the list)
                         Thank you Colonel Durnford.
                              (He exits as DURNFORD 
                              looks on)

               CHELMSFORD joins his group of officers. He mounts his horse 
               and then addresses them:

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         Gentlemen, within ten days we shall 
                         cross the Buffalo River and British 
                         soldiers will then be in Zululand. 
                         Colonel Durnford will remain down 
                         river...

               CLOSE UP of DURNFORD. He looks agitated by this remark.

               Undeterred, Chelmsford continues:

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         where he will be responsible for the 
                         defence of the Natal border.

               Turning his horse and without looking at DURNFORD he leads 
               his Party off.

               BLOOMFIELD is joined by BOY-PULLEN.

                                     BOY-PULLEN
                         Will you hear "Last Post", Sir?

                                     BLOOMFIELD
                         I listened extra careful to your 
                         "Stand To" this mornin', Boy. It was 
                         perfect. I couldn't've done it better 
                         meself, not even when I was Bugler 
                         to The Duke Of Wellington... now 
                         tell me, where did you get that black 
                         eye?

                                     BOY-PULLEN
                         From the Cook, Sir. They saw me dip 
                         your shaving tin in the tea-water 
                         this morning, made their tea taste 
                         of Lifebuoy toilet soap, they said.

               Handing him the bottle of gin he purloined earlier.

                                     BLOOMFIELD
                         So, you got it in the line of dooty...
                              (Taking a swig from 
                              the bottle & handing 
                              it back to BOY-PULLEN)
                         ...point taken.

               BLOOMFIELD gets up onto a wagon as BOY-PULLEN gulps from the 
               bottle.

                                     BOY-PULLEN
                         Will we be fighting the Zulus soon, 
                         Quartermaster?
                              (Joining BLOOMFIELD, 
                              he jumps up onto the 
                              front of the wagon)

                                     BLOOMFIELD
                         Could be.
                              (He shouts for the 
                              wagon to move out)
                         Across the river into Zululand.
                              (They share the bottle 
                              of gin)
                         They might just be waiting there for 
                         us to show up.... them stabbing 
                         assegais pointing right at our 
                         bellies!

                                     BOY-PULLEN
                         You afeared of the Zulus then, 
                         Quartermaster?

                                     BLOOMFIELD
                         One Zulu is only one man... and I'm 
                         afeared of no one man... but the 
                         Zulu, they come in the thousands... 
                         like a black wave of death... in the 
                         thousands... and them assegais... 
                         stabbing!

               The BOY-PULLEN doesn't answer. He stares into the darkness, 
               contemplating the prospect of the morning as described by 
               BLOOMFIELD.

               Back in the centre of the camp, VEREKER rides past the 
               bandstand to meet DURNFORD.

                                     DURNFORD
                         Your orders, Mr Vereker?

                                     VEREKER
                         I'm to take the Sikali with the main 
                         column to the river.

                                     DURNFORD
                         Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to 
                         stay back with my Basutos.

                                     VEREKER
                         I think Chelmsford wants a good man 
                         on the border. Why he fears a flanking 
                         attack and requires a steady Commander 
                         in reserve.

                                     DURNFORD
                              (Angrily)
                         The wrong side of the river! The 
                         wrong place!
                              (DURNFORD glares at 
                              VEREKER, who realizes 
                              he has hit a raw 
                              nerve)
                         Does he wish me to fight the Zulu, 
                         or merely observe their natural 
                         habitat?

               Sensing his cue to exit, VEREKER salutes and saying "Sir" 
               turns his horse to join the Sikali who are leaving the camp.

               DURNFORD walks his horse a few paces forward as he watches 
               the troop leave.

                                     DURNFORD
                              (With sincerity)
                         God go with you, Mr Vereker.
                              (He turns his horse 
                              about as the band 
                              music swells to its 
                              conclusion)

               RIVER BANK.

               Two punts, carrying redcoated soldiers are being hauled across 
               the water by rows of Basutos on the opposite bank. As they 
               unload, the soldiers immediately form into columns.

               The first ox-wagon is driven out of the river, with much 
               shouting and encouragement from the drover and watching 
               soldiers. There is general activity everywhere.

               LOW SHOT. The wheels of the wagons and the Basuto's feet are 
               seen trudging through the slop of mud.

               LONG SHOT OF CAMP. A column of Basutos is seen walking towards 
               the camp. The white tents are dominant in the background.

               SWITCH to CHELMSFORD, seen mounted on horseback. He surveys 
               the proceedings through a pair of binoculars.

               troop of SIKALI HORSE across the river.

               multitude.

               CLOSE UP of VEREKER. With gritted determination he spurs his 
               horse onward up the bank.

               SGT. WILLIAMS is seen seated upon a covered wagon about to 
               enter the water.

               PTE. WILLIAMS is on foot trying to instruct the animals.

                                     PTE. WILLIAMS

                         idiot.

                              to pushing the side 
                              of the wagon)
                         Get 'em in line!

               PTE. WILLIAMS loses his footing, slipping into the water. He 
               is fully immersed.

                                     PTE. WILLIAMS

                              that the water only

                         Sorry Serg'.
                              (He struggles onward 
                              through the water)

               COGHILL & MELVILL are seen crossing.

               More oxen cross.

               A column of redcoats carrying rifles are seen striding onward. 
               The SIKALI HORSE ride past in the foreground.

               WIDE ANGLE. Both sides of the river are seen. Redcoats climb 
               the hill in the foreground. Everywhere seems more settled.

               CAMERA again picks up the SIKALI HORSE. They ride across 
               screen in CLOSE FOREGROUND to reveal a stationary VEREKER on 
               horseback.

               NORRIS-NEWMAN rides towards him. He has a red claret-and-
               port-drinker's face and is wearing civilian bush-clothes 
               including a huge bush-hat.

                                     NORRIS-NEWMAN
                         Do you think Cetshwayo will send a 
                         party to greet you, Mr Vereker?

                                     VEREKER
                              (Calmly stroking his 
                              horse)
                         Oh they're here alright. We just 
                         have to make sure they don't get 
                         back to announce us.

                                     NORRIS-NEWMAN
                         You mean you've seen them?

               Without answering, VEREKER turns his horse towards the hills. 
               Breaking into a gallop, he shouts the command:

                                     VEREKER
                         Forward Sikali!

               NORRIS-NEWMAN watches through his binoculars, then turns his 
               horse back towards the camp.

               CLOSE UP of CHELMSFORD. We see the view through his 
               binoculars.

               He is watching NORRIS-NEWMAN enter the camp.

               CREALOCK approaches on horseback. They exchange salutes.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         What's that strange name the newspaper 
                         chap's called?

                                     CREALOCK
                         Er, called Noggs, Sir. Actual name 
                         is Norris-Newman. He presented 
                         credentials from "The Standard".

                                     CHELMSFORD

                         they not?

                              (Smiling)
                         Of course, Sir.

               They exchange knowing looks and turn their horses about 
               towards camp.

               EXT. SWITCH TO RIVER. CLOSE TO CAMP - RORKE'S DRIFT. DAY

               A long line of NATAL NATIVE COMPANY is transporting wooden 
               boxes of ammunition on their shoulders across the river. 
               V.0. of a brusque NCO is heard:

                                     NCO
                         Come on lads, it's only a river!
                              (The NCO is seen in 
                              CLOSE UP in the 
                              foreground)

               LIEUTENANT COLONEL HAMILTON-BROWN, a rough kishman, and old 
               campaigner joins in:

                                     HAMILTON-BROWN
                         Come on you piss-arse lot, get these 
                         bastards across. It's only water. 
                         Come along you idle scum, let's 'ave 
                         yer.

               HAMILTON-BROWN rides away as we see a native fall into the 
               water under his burden.

               CHELMSFORD and his Company cross the river.

               NATAL NATIVE COMPANY is seen again, still struggling across 
               the river.

               The NCO's VOICE is heard:

                                     NCO
                         I'll 'ave your guts fer garters!

               On the far bank CHELMSFORD and his Company are seen riding 
               to meet NORRIS-NEWMAN.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         An historical moment, Gentlemen.

                                     NORRIS-NEWMAN
                         Excuse me, My Lord.
                              (Introducing himself)
                         Norris-Newman, of "The Standard", My 
                         Lord.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         I saw you lead our Cavalry sir.

                                     NORRIS-NEWMAN
                         Indeed I did, My Lord. It was one of 
                         the first to cross.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         Were they in good heart as they 
                         entered enemy territory?

                                     NORRIS-NEWMAN
                         They spurred onto high ground, My 
                         Lord, full of spirit and looking for 
                         the Zulu. Full of sport they were, 
                         My Lord.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         Tell what you see. Write it well, 
                         Sir, and make sure you get it right.

                                     NORRIS-NEWMAN
                         If I've got it right, My Lord, you 
                         lead an invasion into Zululand, for 
                         I see it all around me, but "why?" 
                         is the question my readers will ask. 
                         "Why?"

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         Do not confuse yourself of why? We 
                         must strike a heavy blow. This cannot 
                         be a war of manoeuvre.

                                     NORRIS-NEWMAN
                         So attack is your defence. Well let's 
                         hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis 
                         full destruction.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         My only fear is that the Zulu will 
                         avoid the engagement.

               He turns his horse about and his Company follow as NORRIS-
               NEWMAN looks on in amazement.

               CAMERA PANS to follow CHELMSFORD and his Company as they 
               ride to the foot of the hills.

               We see the view through CHELMSFORD's binoculars. He spots 
               VEREKER with the SIKALI HORSE.

               NORRIS-NEWMAN has caught up with CHELMSFORD:

                                     NORRIS-NEWMAN
                         I have it, My Lord, we attack for 
                         sport -- or is it reputations?

                                     CHELMSFORD
                              (Lowering his 
                              binoculars)
                         Enough of your politicking, Noggs.

                                     NORRIS-NEWMAN
                         I know your views on the usefulness 
                         of the Press, My Lord, but the 
                         Englishman back home wants to know 
                         what his Regiments are doing.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                              (Resuming his gaze 
                              through the binoculars)
                         Then I trust you will tell him exactly 
                         what you have observed.

               QM BLOOMFIELD pulls a drowned Basuto from the river onto the 
               bank. He removes the man's ammunition belt.

               LT. HARFORD approaches. He is on horseback.

                                     BLOOMFIELD
                         Look at that waste. Five rounds ruined 
                         Mr. Haiford. Each round has to be 
                         accounted for.

                                     LT. HARFORD
                              (Referring to the 
                              BASUTO)
                         It's terrible. Quite dreadful. 
                         Something must be done.

                                     BLOOMFIELD
                              (Standing)
                         If they'd been put back in their 
                         boxes,
                              (moving towards Harford)
                         boxes banded and screwed down proper 
                         like, as His Lordship ordered, nothing 
                         would have happened to them, Sir.

                                     LT. HARFORD
                         I'm talking about our drowned Natives, 
                         Quartermaster!

                                     BLOOMFIELD
                         Natives is not on my invoices, Mr 
                         Harford... ammunition is, and 'as to 
                         be accounted for and the brass 
                         cartridge cases returned.

               In disgust, LT. HARFORD turns his horse about. He meets 
               HAMILTON-BROWN at the top of the bank.

                                     LT. HARFORD
                         Several of our Natives went under. 
                         Shouldn't we have a roll call, 
                         Colonel?

                                     HAMILTON-BROWN
                         Not practical, lad... we haven't had 
                         time to make up the rolls yet. 
                         Besides, I'm not sure how many we 
                         had before the crossing.

               HAMILTON-BROWN canters away.

               LT. HARFORD follows reluctantly, not enthralled by this show 
               of callousness.

               A Zulu recognisance party is seen atop the ridge. They view 
               the scene below.

               VEREKER and the SIKALI HORSE ascend the ridge.

               The infantry -- the Twenty Fourth Foot -- fan out in sections, 
               alert to possible attack, and make for the high ground.

               CHELMSFORD's party rides by below.

               One of the Zulu's fires a warning shot into the air.

               VEREKER halts his company, as does CHELMSFORD.

               The guilty Zulu's voice booms out from above:

                                     ZULU
                         Why do you come to the land of the 
                         Zulu?

               LT. MELVILL turns about in his saddle to address CHELMSFORD.

                                     MELVILL
                         May I answer, Sir?

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         By all means, Mr. Melvill.

                                     MELVILL
                              (Moving his horse 
                              forward a few paces, 
                              he bellows a reply)
                         We come here by the Orders of the 
                         Great Queen Victoria. Queen of all 
                         Africa.

               There is a moment of silence:

                                     VEREKER
                              (Gives the order)
                         Forward!

               MELVILL turns to face his Redcoats.

                                     MELVILL
                         Company, advance!

               Turning to a member of his party:

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         Major, send the troops.

               There is a steady advance up the hill. The Zulus turn, 
               scrambling through the undergrowth.

               The SIKALI approach. One of the Zulus turns and stands his 
               ground. He thrusts his assegai at his foe dismounting the 
               SIKALI from his horse. In a second the Zulu jumps astride 
               the horse but his escape is prevented by an offending shot 
               from another SIKALI.

               More SIKALI advance. They bring down several more Zulus.

               A group of four Zulus converge on one SIKALI. They pull him 
               off his horse into a crop of rocks. One Zulu manages to mount 
               the horse and rides away encouraged by the others.

               VEREKER notices this. Slowly and deliberately he removes his 
               rifle from his saddle, takes aim and then fires. The dead 
               warrior falls to the ground.

               A group of LANCERS track one ZULU. The lead LANCER approaches, 
               guiding his horse expertly. He feints with the downstroke of 
               his lance.

               The ZULU lowers his shield.

               The LANCER, on the ZULU now, uses the up-stroke to impale 
               the ZULU to a tree.

               NOGGS rides near the incident.

               CHELMSFORD has surveyed the incident through his binoculars.

                                     MELVILL
                              (to Noggs)
                         Well done, Sir. Did you see, that 
                         Noggs? He deceived him with the up 
                         and took him with the down.

                                     NOGGS
                              (Studying the deceased 
                              Zulu from his horse)
                         Well, well. This one's a grandfather. 
                         At least if he'd been a Zulu in his 
                         prime, I'd have given odds against 
                         your Lancer, Mr. Melvill.

               CHELMSFORD returns his binoculars to their case.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         Well, Gentlemen, first blood to us 
                         and a rousing good report in the 
                         newspapers to satisfy the politicians, 
                         eh?

               EXT. CAMP AT RORKE'S DRIFT. DUSK

               Camp-fires are seen and the sound of neighing horses are 
               heard as the CAMERA follows a small troop of horsemen and 
               wagon cross the river. The CAMERA pans towards the sunset as 
               the "Last Post" is heard.

               EXT. CETSHWAYO'S KRAAL. FIRST DAWN

               The ROYAL IMPIS squat as they listen to their King. Huge, 
               powerful, glowering. He holds the royal trident spear in his 
               hand as he strides before them.

                                     CETSHWAYO
                         My warriors, our people are hungry. 
                         We must gather the crops that will 
                         feed us through the Winter. But first 
                         we must defend our lands... from 
                         those who would steal the fruits of 
                         our labours. The British have broken 
                         their promise... and crossed the 
                         Buffalo River into our homelands. We 
                         must fight to survive.

               A huge hissing sound comes from the multitudes. Assegais 
               thrust to the sun red sky. CETSHWAYO points westward.

                                     CETSHWAYO
                         We must kill!

                                     ALL ZULUS
                         Usutu... Usutu... Usutu...
                              ("Kill")

               Black outlines against the rising red sun, assegais and 
               shields rattling, the Zulus hail their King, pledging loyalty 
               to the death.

               LONGSHOT. EARLY MORNING

               The full splendour of the mountain can be seen through the 
               mist. The country, wide-rolling, is beautiful, but empty.

               The camp is silent. ALL men's eyes are towards the mountain. 
               CHELMSFORD, seated, views the sight through his telescope. 
               CREALOCK & PULLEINE are close by.

               MELVILL approaches on horse-back. He addresses PULLEINE:

                                     MELVILL
                              (Saluting)
                         We're ready to move out, Colonel.

                                     PULLEINE
                              (Addressing CHELMSFORD)
                         My Lord, we're prepared to move armour 
                         to er...

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         Your destination, Colonel?

                                     PULLEINE
                         Um Isil'...
                              (He has difficulty 
                              pronouncing the word)

                                     CREALOCK
                              (With exact 
                              pronunciation)
                         Isandhlwana. Four miles further than 
                         that tallest hill. Follow the track 
                         and it will lead us to the slopes of 
                         the mountain.

                                     PULLEINE
                              (With quiet 
                              contemplation)
                         Isandhlwana... yes...

                                     CHELMSFORD
                              (Leaning away from 
                              his telescope)
                         Isandhlwana.

               THE ARMY PREPARES TO MARCH INLAND FROM THE RIVER.

               CHELMSFORD'S army, with ox-wagons seven-abreast, comes to 
               life and proceeds to lumber noisily toward the peak.

               MELVILL'S company of REDCOATS, guarding the left flank of 
               the wagons, marches, rifles at the ready. Platoons move 
               tactically, one section of each platoon is always in a 
               defensive position.

               Tension everywhere. Drovers glance anxiously upwards. Empty 
               of visible signs of the enemy, the hills are no less 
               threatening.

               MELVILL (on horseback) approaches the lead wagon driven by 
               BLOOMFIELD & BOY-PULLEN.

                                     MELVILL
                         I want your wagons in an extended 
                         line, Quartermaster, but not too 
                         extended, or my Company can't protect 
                         them. No more than fifty feet between 
                         each one.

                                     BLOOMFIELD
                         Sir.

               MELVILL RETURNS TO THE FLANK

                                     BLOOMFIELD
                              (To BOY-PULLEN)
                         If they're too close together, the 
                         stupid things'll walk into each other 
                         and you can sit on your arse for a 
                         good four hours.

               Turning about on his seat he addresses the train under his 
               command:

                                     BLOOMFIELD
                         Come on lads, keep them wagons moving. 
                         No more than fifty feet. Keep 'em 
                         moving. Keep 'em moving.

               COGHILL, stationary, astride his horse watches the movement.

                                     COGHILL
                              (Addressing MELVILL)
                         There Melvill, there stretched out 
                         is my Lord Chelmsford's Army.
                              (Spurring his horse 
                              onward)
                         What a wonderful adventure we 
                         undertake. What a marvelous spree.

               COGHILL & MELVILL break into a canter.

               VARIOUS SHOTS OF THE INCESSANT MOVEMENT FORWARDS.

               SHOUTS, COMMANDS, THE MOVE INTO ZULULAND has started with 
               urgency.

               EXT. ZULULAND EAST OF ISANDHLWANA. HOT SUNNY DAY

               FANNIN, a short, fat English settler, in his thirties, gross-
               featured, rides sleepily over sloping terrain. Behind him, 
               on foot, several black African retainers follow desultorily. 
               FANNIN snorts, sweats, appears generally fat and unhealthy. 
               He halts his horse and removes a bottle from his saddlebag. 
               He takes a large swig from the remaining liquid and discards 
               the bottle.

               FANNIN reaches the top of an animal track at the top of a 
               ridge. Looking down he spots several ZULUS herding a small 
               group of cattle.

               The ZULUS shout calls of alarm.

               Turning around to give orders to his retainers, FANNIN spots 
               them scrambling down the slope away from the ZULUS.

               As FANNIN returns to face front, he gapes as he notices that 
               the valley is black with ZULU IMPIS. They are run-marching 
               towards the west. No noise save the disciplined swish of 
               thousands of feet in the dust.

               FANNIN hesitates, realizes he's been spotted, quickly, cruelly 
               jerks his horse's head round and spurs over the ridge into 
               the next valley.

               UHAMA calls out and MBILINI, BAYELE & another, with UHAMA, 
               sprint up the ridge in pursuit of FANNIN. As they mount the 
               crest, they see FANNIN belting down the far side in search 
               of safety. UHAMA stops the other three momentarily from 
               continuing the chase.

                                     UHAMA
                         Follow the white Man, let him see 
                         you. He will lead you to the soldiers. 
                         Then, let the white Soldiers take 
                         you. When they think they have broken 
                         you, tell them that the Impis are in 
                         the East.

               EXT. ZULULAND NEAR ISANDHLWANA. DAY

               The three Zulus set off in pursuit of FANNIN.

               Riding desperately, FANNIN, his mouth open in fear and his 
               shoulders heaving with effort, drives his tired horse over 
               the rough country.

               FANNIN peers about. Huge pistol in his hand, he spots MBILINI 
               and fires.

               MBILINI 'dies' dramatically, but when FANNIN rides on, MBILINI 
               comes to life, grinning and joins the others to track FANNIN.

               VEREKER and SIKALI appear beyond the next ridge. Spotting 
               FANNIN, VEREKER gives the signal to advance.

               FANNIN reaches VEREKER's party.

                                     FANNIN
                         Zulu! Zulu!

               FANNIN droops in his saddle, too tired to talk. He manages 
               to dismount.

                                     VEREKER
                              (Offering a drink 
                              from his hip-flask)
                         Here.

                                     FANNIN
                         I'm ill... dozens of Zulus followed 
                         me. I must have shot five, six, ten, 
                         I lost count. They just kept coming. 
                         Blood curdling swine.

               VEREKER looks down the slope at the three Zulus who have now 
               been apprehended by the SIKALI. FANNIN drinks again. His 
               avid, greedy behaviour does not enamour his rescuers.

                                     VEREKER
                         Why did they attack you?

                                     FANNIN
                         I discovered their Army, Your Honour. 
                         A valley full of them and beyond.

                                     VEREKER
                         Army? What Army?

                                     FANNIN
                         Beyond them hills, Sir, and coming 
                         this way.

               VEREKER surveys the area. The terrain is empty.

               A concealed Zulu scout watches stolidly at the distance 
               reduced figures below.

               THE CAMP AT ISANDHLWANA. 21, JANUARY. 6:00PM

               CHELMSFORD's party ride into camp.

               PULLEINE is seated at a table outside his tent. He is smoking 
               and studying a document as SGT. MURPHY pours red wine into 
               his tankard. VEREKER crosses in front of the table.

                                     PULLEINE
                         Officer Vereker, er, would you mind 
                         me asking you to take a look at this 
                         map?

                                     VEREKER
                              (Returning to the 
                              table)
                         By all means, Colonel.

                                     PULLEINE
                         You see.

               The ELDERLY & YOUNG BOER seen earlier approach PULLEINE.

                                     ELDERLY BOER
                         Your wagons, Colonel...

                                     PULLEINE
                         What about my wagons?

                                     ELDERLY BOER
                         On an open slope like this, you must 
                         bring your wagons round and form 
                         them into a laager and do it 
                         immediately.

               CHELMSFORD and his lancers arrive at PULLEINE's tent. 
               CHELMSFORD dismounts and addresses PULLEINE.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         I hear you have prisoners, Colonel, 
                         well done.
                              (To Vereker)
                         Good evening, William.

                                     PULLEINE
                         Thank you, Sir.

                                     VEREKER
                         Good evening, Frederick. I think you 
                         should hear this.
                              (To Elderly Boer)
                         You were saying your brother didn't 
                         laager his camp right?

                                     ELDERLY BOER
                         They had seventy-three in their party. 
                         We found seventy-three skeletons six 
                         months later

                                     CHELMSFORD
                              (After a moment's 
                              reflection)
                         Boers require to laager with only a 
                         few wagons, we have many. An 
                         unassailable square of British 
                         firepower is a defence which can be 
                         turned in a moment.

               The BOERS start to move away.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         You're leaving us Master Boer?

               The ELDERLY BOER turns.

                                     ELDERLY BOER
                         I'm going to camp among the rocks 
                         over there.

               The BOERS exit.

                                     PULLEINE
                              (Addressing Chelmsford)
                         My Lord, Mr. Fannin, er...
                              (Picking up and 
                              referring to the map)
                         claims to have seen the Zulu Impis, 
                         some few thousand or so, in this 
                         valley.

               CLOSE UP of map location.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         Unlikely,
                              (Using his riding 
                              crop as a pointer)
                         most unlikely. It would mean taking 
                         24,000 men over mountain tops. This 
                         is not helpful. Have the prisoners 
                         brought to my camp.

               EXT. BATTLEFIELD ISANDHLWANA. EVENING

               The three Zulu prisoners are tied to two wagons. A CORPORAL 
               is administering a serious beating to BAYELE.

               VEREKER approaches.

                                     VEREKER
                              (Indicating to cease 
                              the punishment)
                         Alright Corporal. Anything?

                                     CORPORAL
                         No sir, no.

               VEREKER turns to the prisoner at the other wagon.

                                     VEREKER
                         Be sensible man, tell us.

               The prisoner maintains his silence as VEREKER walks away in 
               dismay.

               REDCOATS and NATAL NATIVE SOLDIERS, in their separate 
               quarters, clean their rifles, carefully oiling the barrels 
               and working. VEREKER passes RUSSELL busy oiling the elevating 
               mechanisms on his rocket tubes.

                                     RUSSELL
                              (To Vereker)
                         Good evening.
                              (Referring to the job 
                              in hand)
                         Dirty work, eh?

                                     VEREKER
                              (In reply)
                         Very dirty.
                              (To himself)
                         Very dirty.

               INT. CHELMSFORD'S TENT.

               CHELMSFORD is seated. PULLEINE and CREALOCK stand behind 
               him. FANNIN is standing to one side beside the desk. VEREKER 
               converses with two of the prisoners in Zulu.

                                     PULLEINE
                         What did they say?

                                     VEREKER
                         Claim they're deserters from the 
                         main Impis in the East. Followed 
                         this way so they could give themselves 
                         up, go home.

                                     PULLEINE
                         Do you believe that?

                                     VEREKER
                         Oh, their bodies are well oiled. 
                         They're fed regularly, but it's 
                         unlikely they're the fugitives they 
                         say.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         Have them questioned further.

               VEREKER exits with the prisoners.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                              (Rising to address 
                              FANNIN at the desk)
                         They claim the Zulu Impis are East 
                         towards the Royal Kraal, and yet 
                         this fellow says they are further 
                         towards the North.
                              (He picks up the map)

                                     FANNIN
                         Wherever they are, Your Worship, 
                         there are sixty thousand or more.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         They multiply, Mr. Fannin. You do 
                         speak the Zulu tongue, do you?

               FANNIN nods.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         And tomorrow I intend to find the 
                         Zulu Impis, Mr. Fannin, and you will 
                         accompany me.

                                     FANNIN
                         Er, I'm no soldier, Your Honour, and 
                         it's further into Zululand.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         You will accompany me, Mr. Fannin, 
                         or you will be arrested.
                              (He gives PULLEINE a 
                              glance as an 
                              indication to dismiss 
                              FANNIN)

                                     PULLEINE
                         This way, Mr. Fannin.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         Crealock. We have scouts out in the 
                         direction he claims he saw the Zulus?

                                     CREALOCK
                         Of course, Sir.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         And?

                                     CREALOCK
                         The only reports of enemy activity 
                         have come from the direction of the 
                         Royal Kraal, at Ulundi.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         Thank you.

               CREALOCK exits as CHELMSFORD continues to study the map.

               BOY-PULLEN stands on top of a wagon gazing at the sunset. 
               BLOOMFIELD is checking stores. BOY-PULLEN clambers down and 
               walks over to BLOOMFIELD.

                                     BOY-PULLEN
                         Why don't the Zulus attack?

                                     BLOOMFIELD
                         Zulu may not wear shoes or trousers 
                         and the like but it don't mean to 
                         say they got no brains. They'll watch 
                         us and wait and find our weaknesses.

               Studying his clipboard, BLOOMFIELD crosses into foreground.

                                     BOY-PULLEN
                         Have we weaknesses, Quartermaster?

               BLOOMFIELD does not answer. He strides forward out of shot. 
               BOY-PULLEN turns, places his bugle to his lips & plays "The 
               Last Post".

               EXT. ZULULAND EAST OF BUFFALO. NIGHT

               The camp is quiet -- but wakeful at the imminence of battle.

               BLACKNESS.

               PTE. WILLIAMS is on sentry-go. There are men seated around a 
               camp fire, PTE. STOREY sits on the back of a wagon, smoking. 
               PTE. WILLIAMS stares into the black night. Insect noises, a 
               horse neighs. He hears something more alarming. His eyes 
               widen, his grip on his rifle tightens. He listens again. He 
               moves to the front of the wagon, convinced he has heard 
               something.

               Returning to the rear he addresses STOREY.

                                     PTE. WILLIAMS
                         What was that, Storey?

                                     STOREY
                              (Leaning forward)
                         What? Piss off. I never heard nothing.
                              (After a moment's 
                              reflection)
                         I don't think.

                                     PTE. WILLIAMS
                         Well I did. Stand To.
                              (He positions his 
                              rifle at the ready)

               Tutting, STOREY throws his cigarette to the ground. He stands, 
               reluctantly.

               The others do not move.

                                     PTE. WILLIAMS
                              (In a forced whisper 
                              to the others)
                         Stand To!

               Ignoring him, all but one remain seated. One other has lit a 
               torch from the fire.

               This PTE. proceeds to SGT. WILLIAMS' tent.

                                     PTE
                         Stand To, Colour Sergeant.

                                     SGT. WILLIAMS
                              (From within his tent)
                         Who gave the order?

                                     PTE
                         Private Williams, Sir

                                     SGT. WILLIAMS
                              (Emerging from his 
                              tent)
                         I've gotta see this.

               SGT. WILLIAMS has reached the wagon. PTE. WILLIAMS is still 
               aiming his rifle into the blackness.

                                     SGT. WILLIAMS
                         Did you call 'Stand To', Private 
                         Williams?

               PTE. WILLIAMS nods, still listening.

                                     STOREY
                         I didn't hear nothing, Serg'.

               SGT. WILLIAMS looks at STOREY. His face shows complete 
               contempt for PTE. WILLIAMS. Then he hears something also. It 
               is the approaching sound of horses hooves.

                                     SGT. WILLIAMS
                              (With sudden urgency)
                         Well, Stand To, damn you!

               PTE. WILLIAMS takes out his bayonet and attempts to fix it.

               SGT. WILLIAMS lays a hand on his arm as if to replace the 
               bayonet back in it's scabbard.

                                     SGT. WILLIAMS
                         No. You've done well fer once. Don't 
                         push yer luck!

                                     PTE. WILLIAMS
                              (He continues to attach 
                              his bayonet)
                         I heard 'em first

                                     SGT. WILLIAMS
                              (With sarcasm)
                         I'll get you a medal for modesty, 
                         Private Williams, would you like 
                         that?

                                     PTE. WILLIAMS
                         You never would, Colour Sergeant. A 
                         medal?

               There are loud noises of advancing bodies coming directly 
               towards them.

               FROM THE BLACKNESS:

                                     DURNFORD (V.O.)
                         Colonel Durnford here.

                                     SGT. WILLIAMS
                              (To PTE. WILLIAMS)
                         Easy, lad.

               As DURNFORD and his escort of fifty mounted BASUTOS approach, 
               SGT. WILLIAMS salutes.

                                     SGT. WILLIAMS
                         Just follow the track, Sir, you'll 
                         come to Lord Chelmsford's Head 
                         Quarters.

                                     DURNFORD
                              (Spurring his horse 
                              onward)
                         Sergeant.

                                     SGT. WILLIAMS
                         Get down, lads.

               The line of sentries relax, unfix their bayonets and most 
               proceed to return to their sleeping bags.

               PTE. WILLIAMS is deflated almost to the point of tears.

                                     SGT. WILLIAMS
                         You done well. Keep it up, lad. Keep 
                         it up.

               A smile reappears upon PTE. WILLIAMS face. He resumes his 
               watch with renewed enthusiasm.

               INT. CHELMSFORD'S TENT NIGHT.

               CHELMSFORD is seated on his bed. DURNFORD stands before him 
               distressed, blinking at his commander's verbal assault.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         You intended to bring your reserves 
                         across the river?

                                     DURNFORD
                         I have received intelligence from, 
                         sources of my own that the Zulu Impis 
                         are moving North of here and threaten 
                         your left.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         Intelligence? Sources of your own? 
                         Did it not occur to you they may be 
                         native rumours? Rumours to draw you 
                         off -- to leave the whole of Natal 
                         open to a possible counter thrust

                                     DURNFORD
                              (After a beat)
                         Cetshwayo wants a head on battle. A 
                         decisive victory, so that his people 
                         can get on with the one battle that 
                         is life and death for his Nation -- 
                         a delayed harvest

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         Are you dictating the strategy of 
                         this war, Sir?

                                     DURNFORD
                         I'm explaining my reasons.

               CREALOCK enters the tent.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         Yes?

                                     CREALOCK
                         A large party of Zulus have been 
                         sighted in the direction of the King's 
                         Kraal.

               Getting up, CHELMSFORD moves over to look at the map on his 
               desk.

               CLOSE UP of map as CHELMSFORD picks up a pair of dividers 
               and measures the distance between Isandhlwana and Ulundi.

               CHELMSFORD turns to face the two men.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         Tomorrow we will continue our advance 
                         on Ulundi. Durnford, kindly return 
                         to your unit Bring them here 
                         immediately to support Pulleine. Mr. 
                         Vereker will join you as ADC. Do you 
                         understand me clearly?

                                     DURNFORD
                         And the threat of counter invasion 
                         no longer exists?

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         Colonel, if on another occasion you 
                         flout my direct orders I shall 
                         reluctantly relieve you of your 
                         command.

               DURNFORD exits in silence. CREALOCK walks over to the map.

                                     CREALOCK
                         Perhaps he has thought to conquer 
                         Zululand on his own, My Lord.

               CLOSE UP of CHELMSFORD as he nods in silent agreement.

               THE CAMP AT ISANDHLWANA. 22ND, JANUARY. 7:00AM

               Reveille is heard. CHELMSFORD emerges from his tent with 
               VEREKER.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         I trust you to keep me well informed 
                         of Colonel Durnford and his men when 
                         they arrive William.

                                     VEREKER
                         Certainly Frederick.

               CHELMSFORD mounts his horse.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         Gentlemen, we move to find camp and 
                         engage the enemy, and my nose tells 
                         me that we may make early contact.

               CHELMSFORD and his party move out. VEREKER looks on.

               PULLEINE is stationary, astride his horse. MELVILL approaches 
               on horseback.

                                     PULLEINE
                         Mr. Melvill, until the reinforcement 
                         arrives we will Stand To.

                                     MELVILL
                         Sir.
                              (Riding off, he 
                              addresses a Bugler)
                         You there. Sound "Fall In".

               As CHELMSFORD'S COLUMN moves out, the camera pans away up to 
               the hills to reveal a hidden Zulu Scout.

               The rear units are half-a-mile from the camp.

               Below, the camp prepares for immediate battle activity 
               everywhere. Redcoats line up, buckling on their packs and 
               pouches.

               PULLEINE, MELVILL & COGHILL, all on horseback, are engaged 
               in conversation.

                                     PULLEINE
                              (To COGHILL)
                         Huge expanse to keep an eye on.
                              (Referring to Nqutu 
                              Range)
                         Would you mind riding over to Stuart 
                         Smith and asking him to bring his 
                         artillery about?

                                     COGHILL
                         Sir.
                              (Riding off)

                                     PULLEINE
                         Oh, Mr. Melvill, kindly send a 
                         lookout. Tell him to call out the 
                         instant he spies Colonel Durnford's 
                         Column coming to reinforce us.

               MELVILL departs.

               COGHILL arrives at STUART SMITH's area.

                                     COGHILL
                         Stuart?

                                     STUART SMITH
                         Yes.

                                     COGHILL
                         How quickly can you move your 
                         artillery forward?

                                     STUART SMITH
                         Well, my horses are feeding, as you 
                         may observe, Mr. Coghill. It'll take 
                         a little while.

                                     COGHILL
                         Well, fed or hungry, Pulleine wants 
                         them in position immediately.
                              (He departs)

                                     STUART SMITH
                         Right.
                              (Addressing one of 
                              his men)
                         Bombardier, to me please.

               CLOSE UP of a concerned looking PULLEINE.

               CLOSE in on CHELMSFORD as he rides to meet NOGGS (NORRIS-
               NEWMAN)

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         What o'clock is it, Mr. Noggs?

                                     NORRIS-NEWMAN
                         Eleven o'clock, My Lord.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         Our friend Colonel Durnford will be,  
                         should be at this minute approaching 
                         Pulleine. I think we'll eat here. I 
                         want to scout that mountain top and 
                         be back with an appetite in one hour.
                              (He turns his horse 
                              about)

                                     CREALOCK
                         Sir.

               DURNFORD'S ARRIVAL AT ISANDHLWANA. 22ND, JANUARY. 11:00AM

               DURNFORD'S COLUMN pounds down the slope into the camp. It is 
               welcomed with relief, tension everywhere relaxes and smiles 
               are seen. There is calling and greeting between the forces.

               AREA BETWEEN WAGONS.

               BAYELE and the OTHER ZULU CAPTIVE held for questioning are 
               tied up to wagons in an area somewhat screened from the camp. 
               MBILINI is on the ground, his feet and hands are bound.

               TWO SENTRIES guard them. MBILINI lies almost unconscious, 
               tongue lolling, from the ropes that bind him. Evidence of 
               the beating he has undergone is extensive.

               The TWO REDCOAT SENTRIES run forward to see DURNFORD'S COLUMN 
               arrive, momentarily leaving the captives.

                                     BAYELE
                              (To MBILINI with 
                              whisper)
                         My brother. We must warn our King. I 
                         will call the white soldier back. 
                         Can you still move to help me?

               MBILINI nods.

                                     BAYELE
                              (Shouting)
                         Guard. Guard!

               The TWO SENTRIES turn. One addresses the other:

                                     SENTRY
                         I'll fix 'im, Serg'.

               He starts to walk back to the wagons. BAYELE continues to 
               shout.

                                     SENTRY
                         Shut that yellin' up, you 'ear me!
                              (He reaches the wagons)
                         Did you 'ear me? Shut up!

               As he passes MBILINI on the ground, the warrior thrusts his 
               trussed legs between the SENTRY'S legs. The SENTRY stumbles 
               to the ground, his head near BAYELE'S feet. He immediately 
               starts to rise but before he can, BAYELE has lifted his 
               powerful foreleg waist high in stamping position and brings 
               it down with a sickening crunch onto the SENTRY'S lower neck.

               Now all is desperate speed. Under BAYELE'S directions, MBILINI 
               stretches to the unconscious SENTRY and manages to take his 
               bayonet with his bound feet.

               INTERCUT WITH SHOTS OF DURNFORD'S ARRIVAL IN CAMP.

               Cutting the ropes about his neck, MBILINI succeeds in rising 
               to his feet, managing to get the bayonet blade to BAYELE'S 
               bonds.

               Between them the first ropes are cut.

               As BAYELE'S hands are freed, the SENTRY on the ground starts 
               to regain consciousness. Taking the bayonet from MBILINI, 
               BAYELE thrusts the weapon into the SENTRY'S back killing 
               him. He removes the bayonet from the SENTRY'S body and also 
               takes a knife from the redcoat's scabbard which he hands to 
               MBILINI. Together they free the third Zulu tied to the other 
               wagon.

               Making their escape, they edge beyond the wagons. Crouching 
               low, they run up the slope and head for the North.

               But all British eyes are to the East or on DURNFORD'S column.

               DURNFORD dismounts, takes in the encampment.

                                     PULLEINE
                         Exceedingly pleased to greet you, 
                         Sir.

                                     DURNFORD
                         Colonel. I see you're 'Standing To.' 
                         Perhaps the men could eat with their 
                         equipment unbuckled.

                                     PULLEINE
                         Oh yes, of course. Excellent idea, 
                         good. Oh, Mr. Melvill, order "Stand 
                         Down", will you?

                                     MELVILL
                         Sir.
                              (He turns his horse 
                              about)

                                     PULLEINE
                         Please.
                              (Indicating that 
                              DURNFORD follow him)

               PULLEINE & DURNFORD walk out of shot as MELVILL is seen in 
               the background.

                                     MELVILL
                         Sergeant Stand the men down would 
                         you.

               8 MILES EAST OF ISANDHLWANA. ROAD TO ULUNDI. 22ND, JANUARY. 
               11:45AM

               CLOSE UP of pencil drawing in progress. The artist is revealed 
               as being CREALOCK. His composition is of a stationary wagon.

               NOGGS observes. Glass of claret in hand, he makes his way 
               towards CREALOCK.

                                     NOGGS
                         Crealock, old fellah.
                              (Sitting beside him)
                         I'm doing notes for my dispatch and 
                         I need to clear up a few military 
                         points. I don't want to bother His 
                         Lordship. Had it drummed into my 
                         thick skull that a good Commander 
                         never willingly splits his forces, 
                         especially in an enemy's country 
                         before knowing their dispositions.

               CREALOCK has continued to sketch throughout Noggs' banter.

                                     CREALOCK
                         Ah, Yes, if we were facing a European 
                         enemy armed with guns I think your 
                         point would hold, Noggs. Further, 
                         may I remind you I do not create the 
                         strategies you wish to comment on. I 
                         am only his Lordship's Secretary.
                              (He gives NOOGS a 
                              smug smile)

               With a slight chuckle he leans closer to CREALOCK.

                                     NOGGS
                         I wouldn't take overly comfort from 
                         that Crealock old fellah because if 
                         he sinks, then you sink with him.

               NOGGS departs, as CREALOCK looks up for a moment and then 
               continues with his drawing.

               EXT. PULLEINE'S H.Q. TENT. ISANDHLWANA. DAY

               DURNFORD, VEREKER & PULLEINE are seated. They are dining 
               together. The occasion is incredibly civilised. The table is 
               laid with a white linen cloth, silver cutlery, condiments 
               and wine glasses containing claret.

                                     DURNFORD
                              (Toying with the wine 
                              in his glass)
                         So, you've been asked to look after 
                         me, Lieutenant?

                                     VEREKER
                         Well, I assure you, Sir, I have no 
                         desire to create difficulties.

                                     DURNFORD
                         And I assure you, you do not. In 
                         fact, I'd be obliged for your best 
                         advice. What have your scouts seen?

                                     VEREKER
                         So far only their scouts. But we 
                         have had reports of a small Impi 
                         farther north, over there.
                              (He turns to indicate 
                              the area to his left)

                                     PULLEINE
                         His Lordship is of the certain opinion 
                         that it's far too difficult an 
                         approach to be chosen by the Zulu 
                         command.

                                     DURNFORD
                              (Looking to the North)
                         Yes, well, difficulty never deterred 
                         a Zulu commander.
                              (Returning his gaze 
                              to VEREKER)
                         How many?

                                     VEREKER
                         We don't know.

                                     DURNFORD
                              (After a moment's 
                              reflection)
                         I think it would be wise to picket 
                         the hills. Just in case.

               VEREKER rises and collecting his hat, exits to carry out 
               DURNFORD'S instruction. DURNFORD returns to his meal.

               EXT. NQUTU PLATEAU DAY MOVING SHOT

               DURNFORD rides out alone.

               VEREKER, S.M. KAMBULA, OFFICERS and a troop of SIKALI horse 
               ride out of camp into the foreground.

               CAMERA PANS the vast African countryside. VEREKER'S column 
               is seen in the distance. CAMERA stops to reveal a ZULU SCOUT 
               in the foreground. He is hidden by a tree. On spying the 
               soldiers, he turns to two young ZULU BOYS behind him. He 
               shouts instructions that they draw attention to themselves 
               by moving their herd of cattle.

               DURNFORD, now with KAMBULA, reaches the top of a rise. He 
               stops and KAMBULA hands him a pair of binoculars. Surveying 
               the land he spots VEREKER'S column. Handing the binoculars 
               back to KAMBULA, he spurs his horse onward.

               VEREKER'S COLUMN come over a rise to see the cattle being 
               urged to the lip of the plateau.

                                     RAW
                              (Pointing to the cattle)
                         There's steak on the hoof, Sir.

                                     VEREKER
                              (Pausing for a moment)
                         Sikali forward!

               Kicking their horses and whooping, the soldiers give chase. 
               The ZULUS try to flee but in vain. One soldier, TROOPER JAMES, 
               aims his rifle at one of the ZULUS and fires. VEREKER, hearing 
               the shot, rides towards TROOPER JAMES, but stops when he 
               gets to the ZULU BOY who is lying motionless on the ground. 
               Dismounting, VEREKER goes over to the body and looks down at 
               the dead boy with compassion.

               TROOPER JAMES spurs to the lip, exultant, keen to kill. He 
               reins his horse abruptly. Holding it still, he stares at the 
               valley before him. Suddenly all energy leaves his body. He 
               stares in disbelief. LT. RAW is beside him.

                                     JAMES
                              (Calling, his voice 
                              unbelieving)
                         Mr. Vereker! Mr. Vereker! Come and 
                         look at this, Sir!

                                     VEREKER
                              (Riding into shot he 
                              addresses JAMES)
                         You've just managed to bring down a 
                         boy of twelve.

               JAMES does not respond. He stares straight ahead. Following 
               his gaze, VEREKER spots what James has found before him.

               EXT. WATERHOLE. VALLEY NEAR ISANDHLWANA. DAY

               The valley they overlook is filled with Zulus, Cetshwayo's 
               main Impi. Close-packed, sitting in silence, covering the 
               whole of the valley floor and perching on every inch of its 
               rising sides, are twenty thousand warriors.

               They have found the long sought main IMPI.

                                     VEREKER
                              (Utter disbelief)
                         My God, we've found them.

               EXT. NQUTUPLATEAU. DAY

               SILENCE.

               VEREKER, RAW & JAMES stare down at the Zulu Impis.

               EXT. VALLEY NEAR ISANDHLWANA. DAY

               The Zulus look up. BAYELE, who stands apart, looks first at 
               his warriors, then up to the English. He shouts the order to 
               advance. Chanting, the Zulus rise and start to clamber up 
               towards the plateau.

               EXT. NQUTU PLATEAU. DAY

                                     VEREKER
                              (Still stunned, he 
                              addresses RAW)
                         Warn the camp. Tell Chelmsford. Inform 
                         His Lordship we've found what he's 
                         looking for.

                                     RAW
                              (Turning his horse 
                              about)
                         Yes, Sir.

               VEREKER orders his troop to line up facing the Zulu.

                                     VEREKER
                         Sikali, forward!

               The mass of Zulus have started to cover the North strip of 
               the plateau.

                                     VEREKER
                         Fire!

               More and more Zulus mount the crest coming into formation. 
               The troopers are amazed at the sheer weight of enemy number.

               VEREKER'S troop fire volleys steadily, the Zulus now six 
               hundred yards away. Some Zulus fall but the mass, getting 
               into disciplined ranks, advance implacably towards them.

               VEREKER gives the order to retreat.

                                     VEREKER
                         Retire! Retire!

               VEREKER'S troop retreat as the ZULU follow.

               INT. PULLEINE'S H.Q. TENT. ISANDHLWANA. DAY

               PULLEINE is seated at his desk. He is writing a letter. He 
               looks up as he hears distant gunfire.

               EXT. PULLEINE'S CAMP. ISANDHLWANA. DAY

               BLOOMFIELD walks through the kitchen area. He stops and looks 
               to the hills as he too hears gunfire.

               INT. TENT. ISANDHLWANA. DAY

               BOY-PULLEN, STOREY and another are having a game of cards. 
               BOY-PULLEN looks up, alert. He too has heard something. STOREY 
               nudges him.

                                     STOREY
                         Oy! Goon. What're doin'?

               BOY-PULLEN dismisses his concern and continues with the game.

               INT. MELVILL'S TENT. ISANDHLWANA. DAY

               MELVILL is seated, relaxed, his feet up on his desk. He is 
               drinking from a tankard. Another officer lies reclined, 
               smoking. On hearing gunshots, MELVILL jumps up, running 
               outside the tent.

                                     MELVILL
                         Don't tell me the Zulu managed to 
                         get up there after all.

               EXT. CAMP. ISANDHLWANA. DAY

               LT. RAW rides into shot.

                                     RAW
                         Zulu!

               MOVING SHOT. CAMERA follows RAW as he rides up to PULLEINE'S 
               tent and dismounts.

                                     RAW
                         They're here.

               PULLEINE emerges from his tent.

                                     RAW
                         I've sent to Lord Chelmsford.

                                     PULLEINE
                         Bugler. Sound "The Alert".

               BUGLER runs into foreground. CLOSE UP as he sounds "The 
               Alert".

               PTE. WILLIAMS is feeding the horses. On hearing the "The 
               Alert" he jumps to attention running out of shot. After a 
               beat he returns to collect his helmet which is positioned on 
               top of one of posts.

               BOY-PULLEN & STOREY emerge from their tent. There are troops 
               scrambling everywhere.

                                     PULLEINE (O.S.)
                         Fall in! At the double!

               Heavy artillery moves into and out of shot.

               PULLEINE & MELVILL, both on horseback, watch the proceedings.

               EXT. BATTLEFIELD. ISANDHLWANA. DAY

               SGT. WILLIAMS is rallying a Company of Redcoats.

                                     SGT. WILLIAMS
                         Wheel 'em in! Wheel 'em in! Wheel 
                         'em in! Come on now. Tighten those 
                         ranks!

               COGHILL, on horseback surveys the ranks from the rear.

               A young BOY-SOLDIER walks in front of the redcoats. He carries 
               an armful of markers. With him is STOREY.

                                     SGT. WILLIAMS
                         Private Storey. Get those markers 
                         pegged out at the double.

                                     STOREY
                         Serg'!

                                     SGT. WILLIAMS
                         One every 'undred yards

                                     STOREY
                              (To Boy Soldier)
                         Come on boy, scamper.

                                     SGT. WILLIAMS
                         ...and Bugler, make sure he pegs 'em 
                         in a straight line -- towards the 
                         enemy!

               RUSSELL & his men with a group of Natal natives run forward 
               to position the rockets.

                                     RUSSELL
                              (Through clenched 
                              teeth as he works)
                         Hold them please God, three minutes. 
                         Please hold them!
                              (With increasing 
                              urgency)
                         Come on, come on, come on. Come on 
                         men!

               STOREY is pacing out the markers on the battlefield. The BOY 
               SOLDIER follows him.

                                     STOREY
                         Ninety two, ninety three, ninety 
                         four, ninety five, ninety six, ninety 
                         seven, nighty eight, ninety nine...
                              (Coming to a standstill)
                         What's next, boy?

               BOY SOLDIER stands motionless. He stares towards the horizon.

                                     STOREY
                         Oy. You useless little bastard. Come 
                         'ere, Scamper.

                                     BOY SOLDIER
                              (Pointing behind Storey)
                         Look. Look!

               STOREY turns to look.

               Vast masses of Zulus appear over the horizon. They are 
               chanting, menacing like a fast approaching swarm of bees.

               Closer shots of the Zulus as they approach. Their assegais 
               poised high above their heads at the ready.

               CAMERA PANS to the tiny white tents of the camp in the 
               distance. The small Company of Redcoats is seen before them 
               and for the first time it is obvious just how outnumbered 
               they are.

               EXT. ZULULAND EAST OF ISANDHLWANA. DAY

               CHELMSFORD & CREALOCK admire the pleasant surroundings. They 
               walk towards a canopied dining area. Servants have prepared 
               a magnificent table. Silver dishes, polished beautifully and 
               gleaming in the hot sun, are carried from a small field 
               kitchen behind a screen.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         Splendid site, Crealock, splendid. I 
                         want to establish Camp here 
                         immediately.

                                     CREALOCK
                         Certainly, Sir.

               Standing around the table are several officers including 
               HAMILTON-BROWN, HARFORD & MILNE. NOGGS is also present. As 
               CHELMSFORD sits, so do the others.

               HAMILTON-BROWN stands apart, drinking uneasily.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         After lunch, Brown, I want you to 
                         return to Isandhlwana and instruct 
                         Colonel Pulleine to join us here 
                         immediately.

                                     HAMILTON-BROWN
                              (Downing the contents 
                              of his glass)
                         If you'll excuse me, My Lord.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         No appetite, Colonel?
                              (He indicates to a 
                              nearby servant to 
                              refill his glass)

                                     HAMILTON-BROWN
                         My men haven't eaten since yesterday 
                         and there won't be any supplies until 
                         I get them back to Isandhlwana.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         Well they can start off now and you 
                         can join them when you've eaten.

                                     HAMILTON-BROWN
                         Kind of you, My Lord. But I don't 
                         think it would be proper for me to 
                         sit at your table while they're with 
                         their bellies stuck to their 
                         backbones.

               Exits.

                                     HARFORD
                              (Rising to leave)
                         Excuse me, Sir.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         Learn nothing from that Irishman, 
                         Harford. Behave.

                                     HARFORD
                         Yes, Sir. Except, how not to...

               General ad. lib. Smug laughter, banging of cutlery on table 
               and cries of "Here, here".

               Solitary SIKALI HORSEMAN approaches Chelmsford's camp.

               RETURN to dining table. The meal is now over. CHELMSFORD 
               cuts the end off a cigar with a silver cigar-cutter. NOGGS 
               is peeling an apple with a silver fruit knife.

               CREALOCK walks into shot. He speaks in CHELMSFORD'S ear.

                                     CREALOCK
                         A strange message from Vereker, My 
                         Lord. It would seem Pulleine has a 
                         battle on his hands. No details. No 
                         intelligence.

               CREALOCK resumes his place at table as CHELMSFORD turns to 
               the others.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         Mr. Milne. Kindly take your telescope 
                         to a high point. Note the events at 
                         Isandhlwana.

                                     MILNE
                         Sir.
                              (He leaves)

               CHELMSFORD also rises and leaves the table.

               CLOSE-UP of CREALOCK, then NOGGS. They both share a sense of 
               foreboding.

               CHELMSFORD walks slowly and deliberately towards an empty 
               wagon. He goes to the front and leaning against the front 
               panel, lowers his head. He wants to be alone.

               EXT. BATTLEFIELD. ISANDHLWANA. DAY

               SHOTS OF THE ZULU ARMY. They stand, chanting, beating their 
               weapons against their shields, ready to attack.

               CAMERA PANS BACK to reveal the vast enormity of the ZULU 
               army in comparison to the small Company of Redcoats.

               VARIOUS CLOSE-UPS of kneeling Redcoats, poised, rifles at 
               the ready. Their faces reveal the terror of the reality before 
               them.

               There is a uniform, disciplined, victorious shout from the 
               ZULU IMPI:

                                     ZULU IMPI
                         Usutu... Usutu!

               Only three hundred yards away, the Zulu Impi advance, vastly 
               outnumbering their enemy ahead.

               CLOSE-UP OF PTE. WILLIAMS. Extremely nervous, he looks to 
               SGT. WILLIAMS for reassurance.

               SGT. WILLIAMS removes a ceremonial sash from his inside pocket 
               and places it defiantly over his tunic. He winks at PTE. 
               WILLIAMS who returns to face the Zulu with renewed confidence.

               DURNFORD leads his column onto the battlefield. Dismounting, 
               the Company takes up it's positions and commences to fire a 
               volley.

                                     DURNFORD
                              (Still on horseback)
                         Steady men. Steady. Steady now.
                              (Addressing one of 
                              his men)
                         Sergeant!

                                     SGT
                         Yes, Sir.

                                     DURNFORD
                         Ride to Lord Chelmsford. Ride toward 
                         Ulundi. Tell him the battle he longs 
                         for has started and he needs to move 
                         here quickly. Quickly.

                                     SGT
                         Yes, Colonel.

               CAVAYE'S AND MOSTYN'S COMPANIES

               The last echo of the "Stand To" is heard. RUSSELL'S men fire 
               a rocket and then another. They sail erratically over the 
               heads of the ZULU IMPI. The third, however, finds it's target 
               and strikes at the centre of the advancing warriors.

               STOREY and BOY SOLDIER run forward hurriedly trying to 
               position their markers.

                                     STOREY
                         All right, this'll do.
                              (Stopping, he hands 
                              BOY SOLDIER his rifle)
                         Here, grab that.

               The Zulus are now uncomfortably close. BOY SOLDIER stands 
               transfixed.

                                     BOY SOLDIER
                         Master.

                                     STOREY
                              (Realizing the close 
                              proximity of the 
                              enemy)
                         Oh, bugger that.

               He throws the markers to the ground and seizing BOY SOLDIER'S 
               hand runs back towards their own lines.

               Still fifty yards away, STOREY & BOY SOLDIER drop to the 
               ground as their own Companies fire a series of volleys in 
               their direction.

               As the Zulus begin to drop, STOREY & BOY SOLDIER seize the 
               opportunity and return to their feet, again running forward.

               As another volley is fired, STOREY & BOY SOLDIER again drop 
               to the ground.

                                     STOREY
                         Somebody's not watching our bloody 
                         markers.
                              (Getting to his feet)
                         Come on, Sunshine.

               STOREY attempts to help BOY SOLDIER to his feet. The boy's 
               body is limp, sprawled and bleeding. He has been shot in the 
               head.

                                     STOREY
                         Oh no.
                              (Bitterly)
                         Come all this bloody way to get shot 
                         by a bullet from Birmingham.
                              (Shouting to his own 
                              lines)
                         Shoot straight, you bastards!

               STOREY takes the boy's hat and runs quickly forward as the 
               ZULUS advance over the inert body.

               The ZULU LEFT HORN is close at hand. RUSSELL works with his 
               Bombardier and artillery men to set up the rockets, but they 
               are losing the race with time.

                                     RUSSELL
                         Fire one. Fire two.

               RUSSELL, recognising the uselessness of his rockets at this 
               point of the battle, draws his sword. He orders his bombardier 
               and small troop of artillerymen to line up and face the Zulu. 
               RUSSELL fights bravely, as do his troop. It is a few dozen 
               men against hundreds. They are inundated by the ZULU tide, 
               which is not checked. Several ZULU fall, but RUSSELL and his 
               troop are simply overcome and vanish as the LEFT HORN 
               continues on its way hence, threatening to cut Durnford's 
               column off from the camp.

               PULLEINE, on horseback, spots the onslaught through his 
               binoculars from the camp. VEREKER rides to meet him.

                                     PULLEINE
                         Reinforcement only. And ride to Stuart 
                         Smith. Let his guns cover Durnford 
                         for a fall back.

                                     VEREKER
                         Yes Sir.
                              (Shouting)
                         Sikali, follow me.

               VEREKER and his SIKALI troop leave the camp. PULLEINE watches 
               before returning to his binoculars.

               STUART SMITH commands the aiming and firing of his seven and 
               twelve pounders. VEREKER rides up from the background.

                                     VEREKER
                         You give me some covering fire for 
                         Durnford on the right flank.

                                     STUART SMITH
                         Sir. Whole section RIGHT!

               One of the big guns is brought about to fire at the line to 
               the south which attacks DURNFORD.

                                     STUART SMITH
                         Fire!

               CLOSE ON DURNFORD. He watches in appreciation as the big 
               shells start to land amongst his attackers causing havoc.

                                     DURNFORD
                         Fire!
                              (Recognising the 
                              hopelessness of the 
                              situation)
                         Retreat!

               The companies wheel about to race back to the relative 
               security of a nearby donga.

               There is sudden turmoil as a group of ZULUS hurtle over the 
               lower edge of the donga. A fierce hand-to-hand, assegai 
               against bayonet battle ensues as warrior after warrior rises 
               from cover to come over the edge.

               DURNFORD rides to make sure that firing against the rear 
               line of ZULUS is maintained to prevent it too from coming 
               forward, to secure the temporary breech.

               SOLDIERS of CAVAYE'S COMPANY have withdrawn to the camp 
               periphery and now fire in line with MOSTYN'S COMPANY, volley 
               after steady volley.

               COGHILL and MELVILL shout orders to the ranks.

                                     COGHILL
                         Choose your targets men. That's right. 
                         Watch those markers.

                                     MELVILL
                         Keep steady. You're the best shots 
                         of the Twenty-Fourth. You bunch of 
                         heathens, do it

               CAVAYE'S COMPANY LINES

               SGT. WILLIAMS walks calmly behind the front line.

                                     SGT. WILLIAMS
                         Present, Arms. Watch yer markers. 
                         Watch yer markers. Adjust yer sights.

               STOREY fires in the line. He searches through his pouches 
               for rounds.

                                     STOREY
                         I'm running out of bleedin' 
                         ammunition.
                              (Calling over his 
                              shoulder)
                         Buglen'.

                                     BUGLER
                         What?

                                     STOREY
                         More ammunition. Scamper!

                                     BUGLER
                         I've bin twice already.

                                     STOREY
                         You can go three times. It won't do 
                         you any 'arm. Go on! Run both ways.

               The BUGLER runs towards the ammunition wagon, two hundred 
               yards to the rear. The line fire in volley, working the levers 
               of their breech-loaders.

                                     COGHILL

                              along the line)
                         Keep shooting.

                              ammunition)

                         But bullets run out... and those 
                         bloody spears don't.

               AMMUNITION WAGON.

               BLOOMFIELD is labouring to open another tightly bound and 
               screwed down ammunition box while BUGLERS wait in a queue, 
               restive.

               BLOOMFIELD has to stand over the box and exert great pressure 
               on the screwdriver to force the oxidised screws out of their 
               sockets.

               BOY-PULLEN stands at the front of the queue. He is handing 
               out one box of ammunition at a time to each soldier.

               A NATAL NATIVE reaches the head of the queue. As BOY-PULLEN 
               goes to hand him some ammunition, BLOOMFIELD looks up and 
               strides forward.

                                     BLOOMFIELD
                         Pullen! You will not issue ammunition 
                         from this wagon to any but authorised 
                         Companies. This lot can have their 
                         own.
                              (He snatches the box 
                              back from the NATAL 
                              NATIVE)

               The NATAL NATIVE doesn't understand English but he understands 
               what BLOOMFIELD means. He voices his objection in Zulu.

                                     BLOOMFIELD
                         Get to your own wagon.

               The BUGLER sent by STOREY is waiting impatiently.

                                     BUGLER
                              (Running to the front 
                              of the queue)
                         'ow long we gotta wait, Quartermaster?

                                     BLOOMFIELD
                         Get back in line, boy. Wait your 
                         turn.

                                     BUGLER
                         But, Sir.

                                     BLOOMFIELD
                         Move.

               BLOOMFIELD returns to prizing open the boxes. BUGLER goes to 
               return to the end of the queue but turns back to plead with 
               BOY-PULLEN.

                                     BUGLER
                         Pullen?

                                     BOY-PULLEN
                         Look it ain't my fault. All the tops 
                         are screwed down.

                                     REDCOAT AT FRONT OF QUEUE
                         Come on. I'm waiting.

               BOY-PULLEN gives the REDCOAT one box and then hurriedly hands 
               the other to STOREY'S BUGLER.

               FRONTLINE.

                                     SGT. WILLIAMS
                         Present, Arms.

               STOREY is beginning to panic. The ammunition situation is 
               now becoming desperate.

                                     STOREY
                         Hurry up with that bloody ammo.

               Increasing numbers are not firing. They glance back with 
               impatience towards the ammunition wagons, spaced five hundred 
               yards apart, where queues of BUGLERS and REDCOATS wait for 
               rounds that are distributed too slowly.

               EXT. ZULULAND. EAST OF ISANDHLWANA. DAY

               CHELMSFORD and his COLUMN move slowly and steadily from their 
               Camp towards the West. MILNE approaches on horseback to meet 
               them.

                                     MILNE
                         My Lord, I watched the camp for twenty 
                         minutes. The haze obscures much. The 
                         tents have not been stuck. The only 
                         thing I could distinguish is the 
                         wagons have been moved on mass into 
                         the camp.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         Thank you Mr. Milne. Inform Colonel 
                         Crealock, would you?

                                     MILNE
                         Sir.

               CAMERA PANS away from CHELMSFORD'S COLUMN as we see an 
               OFFICER'S POV through binoculars. Angle changes as we see a 
               rider enter the camp and approach LT. HARFORD.

               CHELMSFORD'S HQ.

               CREALOCK steps into a wagon. He turns to address MILNE who 
               stands outside.

                                     CREALOCK
                         Thank you, Milne.

               MILNE salutes.

               HARFORD approaches urgently. He remains on horseback and 
               talks to CREALOCK through the open side of the wagon.

                                     HARFORD
                              (Out of breath, 
                              agitated)
                         The camp is under attack from a large 
                         force of Zulu. Colonel Pulleine sends 
                         for help.

                                     CREALOCK
                         Calm yourself Mr. Harford. Where do 
                         you come by this intelligence?

                                     HARFORD
                         Durnford's Cavaye himself rode from 
                         the camp.

                                     CREALOCK
                         Very well, go on.

                                     HARFORD
                         Colonel Harness has already turned 
                         with the artillery.

                                     CREALOCK
                              (The severity begins 
                              to register)
                         They have? I see. Ride after Lord 
                         Chelmsford and acquaint him with 
                         your intelligence.

               HARFORD has started but turns his horse about as CREALOCK 
               calls:

                                     CREALOCK
                         Mr. Harford... control your passions. 
                         A professional soldier must keep 
                         cool and thoughtful in times of 
                         stress.

               HARFORD looks as if he is going to explode but controls his 
               feelings and rides after CHELMSFORD.

               EXT. BATTLEFIELD. ISANDHLWANA. DAY

               VEREKER gallops hard as do his troop of BASUTO HORSEMEN. 
               CAMERA TRACKS FORWARD, following them to the donga which 
               DURNFORD'S COMPANIES are defending. Horses are in the donga. 
               The troops are firing from the outer lip of the donga. 
               VEREKER'S MEN provide the much needed backup.

                                     DURNFORD
                         Good work, Mr. Vereker.

               DURNFORD spurs his horse forward. The situation is still 
               desperate.

                                     DURNFORD
                              (Shouting to his troops)
                         Prepare to fall back.

               Line after line of ZULUS run forward to join the assault.

                                     DURNFORD
                         Move the horses!

               CLOSE ON DURNFORD. He signals the next tactic as he rides 
               across the donga. Commands are issued down the line. The men 
               now disengage and run in the opposite direction from the 
               ZULUS, leaping into the donga to find their horses and 
               swinging onto saddles to scramble up the far side, galloping 
               400 yards close to the camp to form a new defence line.

               "The Retreat" is sounded. There is hand-to-hand, bayonets, 
               spears, hunting knives and ZULUS trying to assegai the horses.

               A handful of REDCOATS await the ZULU as they clamber over 
               the ridge. Realization of the vast Zulu numbers suddenly 
               dawns as their NCO shouts in desperation:

                                     NCO
                         Take the high ground!

               The REDCOATS are completely overwhelmed and are soon lost 
               amidst the ZULU onslaught.

               DURNFORD'S COMPANIES ride into camp. There are wounded lying 
               everywhere.

                                     DURNFORD
                         Speed up the ammunition flow, Vereker. 
                         I'll try to hold the road to Rorke's 
                         Drift.

               VEREKER complies.

               Like a huge tidal wave, the ZULUS plough their way through 
               the lines of REDCOATS defending the outer perimeter of the 
               camp.

                                     DURNFORD
                              (Addressing S.M. 
                              KAMBULA)
                         Sergeant, come with me.

               DURNFORD and S.M. KAMBULA depart as ZULU mercilessly stab at 
               the wounded already on the ground.

               SGT. WILLIAMS' MEN are under serious attack.

               The ZULUS are among the NATAL NATIVES, stabbing, stabbing, 
               stabbing.

               The ZULU LOIN is sitting some three hundred yards from the 
               battle, facing away from it. The ZULU LOIN, two IMPIS of 
               seasoned warriors, start to run towards the gap through which 
               the NATAL NATIVES, ZULUS and SMITH'S GUNS are streaming.

               Both lines of REDCOATS are attacked from the back, and the 
               lines try to fight enemy in front and behind.

                                     SGT. WILLIAMS
                         Fire. Fire. Close ranks. Retreat!

               SGT. WILLIAMS, pistol in hand, sees the danger to the guns.

                                     SGT. WILLIAMS
                         Save those guns.

               SGT. WILLIAMS grabs a passing ZULU by the throat. He throws 
               him to the ground and beats him to death. Reaching the top 
               of a ridge, he bayonets a ZULU scrambling up the ridge towards 
               him. Withdrawing the blade, he turns just in time to bayonet 
               another ZULU attacking from the rear.

                                     SGT. WILLIAMS
                              (Shouting & looking 
                              around desperately)
                         Private Williams!

                                     PTE. WILLIAMS
                              (From just below the 
                              ridge)
                         Sgt. Williams!

                                     SGT. WILLIAMS
                         Come 'ere. Get yourself up 'ere.
                              (He grabs PTE. 
                              WILLIAMS' jacket 
                              pulling him up onto 
                              the higher ground)

                                     PTE. WILLIAMS
                              (Struggling)
                         Sir... Ah!... Ah!

                                     SGT. WILLIAMS
                         Come on. Getup!

               SMITH'S GUNS are driven away.

                                     SGT. WILLIAMS
                              (Helping PTE. WILLIAMS 
                              to his feet)
                         You'll get a medal yet, Private 
                         Williams.

               At this point SGT. WILLIAMS falls to his knees. He has been 
               assegaied in the back. PTE. WILLIAMS thrusts his bayonet 
               over SGT. WILLIAMS head, killing the offending ZULU. He turns 
               and bayonets another running towards him.

                                     SGT. WILLIAMS
                         Behind you, lad! Ah no...
                              (He is struck again)

               But it is too late. A single assegai penetrates PTE. WILLIAMS' 
               back.

               Both Sergeant and Private die together.

               CLOSE IN on BAYELE as he leads the ZULUS onward.

               CAMERA FOLLOWS THREE SIKALI HORSEMEN as they gallop towards 
               BLOOMFIELD'S ammunition wagon. Another GROUP OF REDCOATS 
               surrounds the wagon. BLOOMFIELD and BOY-PULLEN serve them 
               with ammunition which is fired with discipline at a rapid 
               rate.

                                     BLOOMFIELD
                         Wait your bloody turn. Wait your 
                         bloody turn and get in line.
                              (Handing a box to a 
                              young private)
                         There you are, boy.

               LONG SHOT of the ZULUS streaming across the plain.

               Many of the REDCOATS have turned and are running for their 
               lives. The battleground is awash with red tunics. As the 
               CAMERA passes over the dead, one body suddenly leaps to his 
               feet. It is PTE. STOREY. He has been playing 'dead'. Running, 
               he makes for cover beneath a wagon. He searches beyond the 
               mass of ZULUS for a target. He sees the distant INDUNAS, he 
               aims carefully and fires.

               STOREY, satisfied with the result, now kneels to the corpse 
               of a fallen man beside him. He finds LT. CAVAYE dead. He 
               bends to search him for ammunition. STOREY finds one 
               cartridge, spitting on it for luck, he loads, aims and fires.

               A huge line of ZULUS run forward and engulf him.

               CLOSE UP of STOREY'S torso beneath the wagon. An assegai 
               protrudes from his chest.

               SWEEPING SHOT. The ZULU LOIN is streaming into the camp 
               through the gaps in the north and north-east corner. The end 
               is near.

               VEREKER and a trooper gallop towards BLOOMFIELD'S AMMUNITION 
               WAGON.

                                     VEREKER
                              (To BLOOMFIELD)
                         Over here. Quickly.

               BLOOMFIELD hands VEREKER a whole case of ammunition which he 
               passes to the TROOPER beside him.

                                     VEREKER
                         Quickly, Trooper.

               VEREKER & TROOPER approach DURNFORD'S LINES with the 
               ammunition.

                                     DURNFORD
                         Well done, Vereker. Now goodbye, 
                         lad.

               The pair exchange glances.

                                     DURNFORD
                         Go on.

               After a beat, VEREKER turns his horse about and rides away.

                                     DURNFORD
                         Sergeant.

               The Sergeant takes DURNFORD'S HORSE by the bit as DURNFORD 
               dismounts.

               CLOSE UP of the ammunition case as the men frantically try 
               to open it with their bayonets and rifle butts.

               CLOSE UP of DURNFORD. He is firing his pistol.

               CAMERA finds ELDER BOER in crowd as he is assegaied in the 
               back.

               The fighting is hand-to-hand, with a few REDCOATS having 
               rounds which they fire with discipline under the command of 
               DURNFORD.

               COGHILL and MELVILL command the squad of REDCOATS who form 
               an approximate ring around PULLEINE'S tent. Some wagons have 
               been pulled forward to form a partial barricade. PULLEINE 
               stands in the centre.

               A BUGLER BOY holding the Regimental Colours is close by.

               COGHILL & MELVILL ride up to PULLEINE.

                                     PULLEINE
                         Well fought, Gentlemen. It's time to 
                         save the Colours. Get to Rorke's 
                         Drift. You must warn them.
                              (To BUGLER BOY)
                         The Colours.

               PULLEINE takes the Colours from the BUGLER BOY and hands 
               them to MELVILL.

                                     PULLEINE
                         Carry them to safety Mr. Melvill.

                                     MELVILL
                         Sir.

               COGHILL and MELVILL take the Colours, spur through the ZULUS 
               and head to the gullies and ravines that lead to the river.

               PULLEINE watches, moves back into his tent.

               CLOSE UP of DURNFORD. He looks over his shoulder and then 
               back to the ZULU before him. He makes a decision and moves 
               away from the front line.

                                     DURNFORD
                              (To S.M. KAMBULA)
                         Sergeant! Sergeant! Take my horse. 
                         Up you go.

               S.M. KAMBULA is helped up into the saddle.

                                     DURNFORD
                         Sergeant, you're to ride back to 
                         Natal. When you see the Bishop tell 
                         him...
                              (He pauses momentarily)
                         that is, tell his daughter, I was 
                         obliged to remain here with my 
                         infantry. Now go. God go with you.

                                     S.M. KAMBULA
                         I leave God Jesus with you.

               He leaves as CAMERA closes in on DURNFORD'S face.

               SMITH'S guns, at full gallop, sweep through the camp.

               VARIOUS SHOTS of the battle. The battlefield is covered with 
               dead ZULU and REDCOAT bodies.

               BLOOMFIELD'S AMMUNITION WAGON.

               Some of the ZULUS have picked up burning brands from the 
               cooking fires and are setting the wagons on fire.

               BLOOMFIELD & BOY-PULLEN jump down from their wagon, taking 
               some cases of ammunition with them.

                                     BLOOMFIELD
                         Move it!

                                     BOY-PULLEN
                         I'm trying.

               They are only ten yards away when there is a massive 
               explosion. The wagon has burst into flames and the ammunition 
               continues to explode.

               CLOSE UP of BLOOMFIELD. He is lying face down on the ground 
               in a state of shock. He slowly turns his head and we see the 
               bloody corpse of BOY-PULLEN. BLOOMFIELD'S face grimaces as 
               he is stabbed in the back by an unseen assailant. His face 
               falls into the dirt.

               INT. PULLEINE'S H.Q. TENT. DAY

               PULLEINE is sitting inside his tent. He is writing a letter 
               to his wife. There is a pistol on the table.

               BAYELE enters the tent. PULLEINE immediately picks up his 
               pistol and aims at BAYELE. There is a moment's hesitation 
               from both.

               PULLEINE drops his pistol to one side inviting BAYELE to 
               kill him. BAYELE seizes the moment and with one forward fatal 
               thrust, stabs PULLEINE in the heart.

               PULLEINE slumps onto the desk as BAYELE leaves without 
               remorse.

               LONG PAN SHOT of MELVILL & COGHILL as they take the Colours 
               out of the camp.

               VEREKER is nearby as a ZULU leaps out, bringing MELVILL and 
               his horse to the ground.

               VEREKER shoots the ZULU.

               MELVILL gets up, hands the Colours to COGHILL and gets back 
               up onto his horse.

                                     MELVILL
                              (To COGHILL, indicating 
                              the Colours)
                         Give them to me.
                              (COGHILL does so)
                         Come on. Come on!

               They spur onward, COGHILL using his pistol as they do so.

               MOVING SHOT. A gun carriage charges over the slope. As it 
               does so, the rear gunner is shot and the gun itself becomes 
               disengaged from the rest of the carriage tumbling down the 
               slope.

               GUN CARRIAGE IN FOREGROUND. VEREKER, COGHILL & MELVILL ride 
               over this obstacle (SLOW MOTION) the Colours aloft.

               EXT. BATTLEFIELD. ISANDHLWANA. DAY

               HIGH VIEW. DURNFORD'S South-East defence position. ZOOM 
               forward to show the first refugees behind from the camp 
               breaking out on the South, crossing into the ravine; their 
               line of exit the same as the guns, defended by DURNFORD'S 
               troops.

               CLOSE UP of DURNFORD. He loads his pistol and turning full 
               circle, realizes that he and his troops are surrounded. 
               Jumping up onto an ammunition wagon, he starts to target the 
               approaching ZULUS, now only ten yards away. He uses all six 
               shots, throws his pistol to one side and picks up a discarded 
               assegai from the wagon. As he frantically tries to batter a 
               ZULU warrior, another ZULU aims a rifle straight at him.

               There is a single shot. DURNFORD, clasping the shoulder of 
               his disabled left arm, falls off the ammuntion wagon and 
               tumbles down the ravine, landing at the bottom with a painful 
               thud. Out of breath, he struggles to sit upright, his back 
               against the muddy bank of the ravine.

               A ZULU appears at the top of the ravine. Standing on top of 
               the ammunition wagon, he throws his assegai down at the body 
               below. It finds it's target, piercing DURNFORD in the chest. 
               Short of breath, he makes a vain attempt at removing the 
               weapon but his efforts are futile. He draws his last breath 
               and dies.

               EXT. FUGITIVE'S RAVINE. DAY

               COGHILL, MELVILL & VEREKER desperately fighting to control 
               their horses scrambling down the hazardous rocky terrain -- 
               quarry to the pursuing relentless ZULUS behind them. REDCOATS 
               on foot are overtaken and dispatched with stabbing assegais.

               EXT. RIVER BANK OPPOSITE RORKE'S DRIFT

               COGHILL, MELVILL & VEREKER urge their horses onward, galloping 
               into the river.

               Several ZULUS remain on the bank, shooting rifles and throwing 
               assegais into the water.

               One ZULU jumps into the water and attempts to swim after 
               them.

               VEREKER is the first to reach the opposite bank. The other 
               two have become separated from their horses. VEREKER'S is 
               close by. Scrambling up the bank, VEREKER turns to COGHILL & 
               MELVILL who are still in the water.

                                     VEREKER
                         For God's sake, hold them back! I'll 
                         get the horses.

               COGHILL is the next to reach the bank. He turns back to 
               MELVILL who is struggling in the water with the Colours.

                                     COGHILL
                         It's alright It's alright.

               He helps MELVILL up onto the bank as VEREKER mounts his horse. 
               VEREKER rides off in pursuit of the other two horses.

               There is a single rifle shot, which brings VEREKER'S horse 
               to the ground. In the background we see a vast number of 
               ZULUS engulf COGHILL & MELVILL. MELVILL attempts to fight 
               with his sword but he is overwhelmed. There is an awful 
               piercing scream and the two men disappear.

               INTERCUT BETWEEN VEREKER & GROUP OF ZULUS.

               VEREKER lies on the ground, his left leg trapped beneath the 
               body of his horse. He sees the ZULUS take up the Colours as 
               they run up to the high ground, revealing COGHILL & MELVILL'S 
               dead bodies in the FOREGROUND.

               VEREKER is breathing uneasily. He watches with amazement as 
               the ZULUS hold the Colours aloft mockingly. Some ZULUS are 
               wearing their purloined Redcoat uniforms, they whoop and 
               wail exultantly.

               VEREKER takes his time. He aims his rifle at the ZULU carrying 
               the Colours.

               The shot kills the ZULU and the Colours fall (SLOW MOTION) 
               down, down into the river.

               Relieved, VEREKER'S head falls to the sandy bank.

               The Colours float into CLOSE UP.

               EXT. PULLEINE'S CAMP. ISANDHLWANA. DUSK

               CHELMSFORD and his ESCORT ride into the camp. The air is 
               full of smoke and the crackling of fire can still be heard. 
               A dead soldier who has been tied to a post and disembowelled 
               is CENTRE SCREEN.

               The wind begins to howl as CAMERA follows CHELMSFORD into 
               the centre of the camp. He dismounts. Very slowly he removes 
               his helmet.

               CLOSE UP of HARFORD. A solitary tear trickles down his cheek 
               as he surveys the area with disbelief.

               Stationary, CHELMSFORD looks around him. Then very slowly 
               and deliberately he walks forward towards the CAMERA.

               CAMERA PANS to reveal CREALOCK, still on horseback, in the 
               background. He rides into focus.

                                     CREALOCK
                         Excuse me, My Lord, there's something 
                         I must convey to you. I rode a little 
                         way along the track to Rorke's Drift. 
                         The sky above is red with fire.
                              (Pause)
                         Your Orders, My Lord? Do we move to 
                         the Drift?

               CHELMSFORD does not answer. He continues to walk forward, 
               expressionless.

               TIGHT CLOSE UP. CHELMSFORD lowers his head, his eyes still 
               front.

               CROSS FADE to blood red sunset. Script is superimposed:

               The Battle of Isandhlwana was recorded in history as the 
               worst defeat ever inflicted on a modern army by native troops.

               In Parliament, upon the downfall of his government, British 
               Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, asked the question:

               "Who are these Zulus, who are these remarkable people who 
               defeat our generals, convert our bishops and who on this day 
               have put an end to a great dynasty?"

               ZULU singing and chanting crescendos.

                                         THE END
