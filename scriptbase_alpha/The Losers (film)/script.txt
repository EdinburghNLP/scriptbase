                                                 February 2007

           FADE IN ON:
                         
          THE DESERT. Sizzling dunes. Harsh. Unforgiving.
                         
          Afghanistan - Three Years Ago
                         
          We hear faint SCREAMS. A man BEGGING...
                         
           MAN (O.S.)
           No... please... There's no way...
                         
          Sand dunes stretch to the horizon. Nowhere to run...
                         
           MAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           Nothing... can defeat...
          A SHADOW FALLS across the sand. Then a second. One looks
          like a Dog's Head. The other like...
                         
           MAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           Gojira.
                         
          HAND PUPPET SHADOWS. LAUGHTER from OTHER MEN. "Godzilla"
          pursues "Dog Head", catches him, and begins HUMPING HIM.
                         
           MAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           Ooooh, Gojira! You the best! Me
           love you long time!
                         
           SECOND MAN (O.S.)
           C'mon Jensen, you in or not?
                         
          WHIP PAN to the Puppeteer and FREEZE-FRAME ON:
                         
          Jensen. 20's, Lennon glasses, wild blonde hair, shirt
          open. Bald eagle tattoo on his chest. RESUME SPEED:
                         
                          JENSEN
           And get cheated again?
                         
          WHIP PAN to and FREEZE-FRAME ON:
                         
          Pooch. Mid 30's, black and solid. Eagle tattoo on right
          bicep, his NINE MONTH OLD DAUGHTER'S FACE tattooed on his
          left. Currently mock offended. RESUME SPEED:
                         
                          POOCH
           The Pooch don't cheat. The Pooch
           may lie, the Pooch may steal--
           2.
                         
                          JENSEN
           --the Pooch may refer to himself

                          POOCH
           --but the Pooch will not cheat.
                         
                          JENSEN
           The Pooch can rest easy, I was
           referring to Cougar.
                         
          WHIP PAN and FREEZE FRAME ON:
                         
          Cougar. Age unknown. Tan camo cowboy hat pulled low
          over his eyes, long hair. Sniper Rock-God. He doesn't
          say or move much. Ain't no rattling him. RESUME SPEED:
           ROQUE (O.S.)
           It's Liar's Poker, Jensen, how in
           the hell is the man gonna cheat
           you at Liar's Poker?
                         
          WHIP PAN as he asks the question and FREEZE FRAME ON:
                         
          Roque. 30's. Close cropped black hair. If Lance
          Armstrong bred with Darth Vader. Doesn't smile much, but
          he's smiling now. The four are in
                         
          EXT. HUMVEE -- DAY
                         
          Open air, the guys sit in the back. In the middle of the
          desert with nothing to do but wait. Roque holds the deck.
                         
                          ROQUE
           Cards.
          The four take them. Lick the back, slap them to their
          foreheads -- two deuces (Jensen and Roque), a three
          (Pooch), and an eight (Cougar). Pitiful cards.
                         
                          JENSEN
           Got a feeling about this one, Roque.
                         
                          ROQUE
           Your mama had that feeling too.
                         
          At which point, JENSEN PULLS A KNIFE...
                         
          ...and tosses it into the center of the circle. HIS BET.
          Roque responds by tossing a .357 MAGNUM from his belt in.
           3.
                         
                          ROQUE (CONT'D)

                          ROQUE
           Yup.
                         
                          POOCH
           Oh, shit, I'm definitely in then.
                         
          He puts in a Desert Eagle. Jensen pulls a second, meaner
          looking knife. Twirling it.
                          JENSEN
           This even me up?
                         
                          ROQUE
           Exactly how many knives do you
           have, anyway?
                         
          Jensen grins and STABS IT down into the pot.
                         
                          POOCH
           Cougar - your bet.
                         
          The Silent Man stares at the others. Two deuces and a
          three. He shakes his head at them. Before he can bet...
                         
           VOICE (O.S.)

          The others stare at him. Automatically begin checking

          MOVING THROUGH a tight hallway, they find the children
          locked in a large empty room. They start leading them
          out. One LITTLE BOY stops Clay. In PASHTUN:

          The Man pales. Realizing the American understands what

          Omar DOESN'T MOVE. Instead, he eerily raises his hand
          and wordlessly POINTS TO A CELL. In the corner. And
          Clay hears a MOAN emit from it. VAGUELY HUMAN.
                         
          Omar lowers his arm. Goes upstairs, dragging his bear.

          Clay's eyes dart down to the Pilot's neck. A SILVER

          Omar, holding Clay's gaze as they rise. Only broken as
          the chopper begins to recede into the distance. The last

          Clay and Cougar have ALREADY BEGUN RUNNING towards the
          receding chopper on the horizon. As the MIG SWINGS IN
          BEHIND THE BLACKHAWK....

          WOOSH... The MIG FIRES - AIR TO AIR MISSILE... WHOOMP!
          The Blackhawk's tail rotor SHEARED OFF, the chopper
          spinning and falling but still intact...
           15.
                         
          Pooch, the pilot, from somewhere SCREAMING:

          The SECOND MISSILE from the MiG SLAMS INTO THE BLACKHAWK

          screaming by the time they reach the wreck...
                         
          OMAR'S TEDDY BEAR, BLACKENING to a crisp. Clay tries to

          A safe house. A LARGE MAN stands in the shadows, watching
          as Roque, Jensen, Pooch, Cougar, and Clay yell back and
          forth at FENNEL - a CIA Handler:
                          FENNEL
           What are you talking about "MAX?"
                         
                          CLAY
           He set up the Operation-
                         
                          FENNEL
           There was no operation! You were
           never radioed orders!

                          FENNEL
           You kill a friendly Afghan warlord,
           probably lose us the support of
           half the tribes in the region, and
           your alibi is "MAX?"
                          (PAUSE)
           Wait - are you saying you're Max?
                         
                          CLAY
           What?
                         
                          FENNEL
           Colonel, Max is an Agency code for
           a rogue agent or operation-

           LARGE MAN (O.S.)
           There is no specific Max.
                         
          The LARGE MAN finally steps out of the shadows. Special
          Forces, like our guys. WADE. They know him.
                         
                          WADE
           "Max" is catch-all for exactly
           what you've been accused of.
           Terminology's been around since
           the 50's.
                         
          Silence as the guys take this in.
                         
                          CLAY
           We didn't kill those kids, Wade.
          Wade studies him. Finally:
                         
                          WADE
           I believe you.
                         
          Fennel sighs.
                         
                          FENNEL
           Stay here. We'll be back.
                         
          They watch Wade and Fennel leave. Now alone. SILENCE.
          After a bit, Pooch looks down. Under a little table...
                         
                          POOCH
           Wade left his suitcase.

          But in no way bolder. They look almost... Broken.
                         
          Roque's got his feet up. Sucks lazily on a straw embedded
          in what looks like a SODA POP. Clay's got BINOCULARS,
          following the action on the track -- Muscle shredded
          greyhounds tearing over the dirt. One crosses the FINISH

          Clay drums his fingers along the binocs as he scans. We
          see on his right hand, between his thumb and index finger -
          A TATTOO. A TEDDY BEAR. Looks just like Omar's...

           Four.
                         
          Something glint-flashes...catches Clay's eye. He looks
          across the track, towards the PARKING LOT.
                          ROQUE
           You know where you're messing up?
           You're putting all our money on

           Yeah, I've just gone crazy with
           that approach.
                         
          CLAY SCANS THE LOT -- A YOUNG WOMAN in tight jeans walks
          towards a black pick up, carrying a PAIR OF BINOCULARS.
                         
                          ROQUE
           Never play a longshot, you're never
           gonna win.
                         
          Clay doesn't respond. Watching her. Roque exhales.
                          ROQUE (CONT'D)
           We're at a dogtrack at 10 a.m. -

           Maybe if we were drinking.

           the Company...
                         
                          CLAY
           All we did was say the word "Max"
           and they blew up a building. CIA
           even gets a whiff of where we're
           at, they'll call in an airstrike.
           (shakes his head)
           Until we figure out how we can
           take Max down and get clear, we
           lay low.
                         
          A Metro Dade POLICE CRUISER rolls into the McDonald's.
          Clay watches close as it pulls into a parking spot...
                         
                          ROQUE
           Due respect, you're nobody's Colonel
           anymore.
                         
                          CLAY
           Anytime you want to move along you
           go right ahead-
           22.
                         
                          ROQUE
           Like the others? Least I still
           talk to them. You pushed them
           away. "Max this, Max that" - we
           never even saw the guy, Clay-
                         
                          CLAY
           We heard his voice. Guy with a
           voice is a guy with a throat. And
           if he's got a throat...
                         
                          ROQUE
                          (IN DISBELIEF)
           We're hiding out in the parking
           lot of a goddamn McDonald's--You
           actually think we're in any position
           to take on some shadowy CIA super-
           spook?
                         
                          CLAY
                          ROQUE-
                         
                          ROQUE
           No, it's a stellar plan - we can
           use this as our base of ops!
           (gestures to the
                          PLAYGROUND)
           Pooch can run the motor pool out
           of the ball pit and Jensen can set
           up communications by the slide!
                         
          Clay, seeing one of the COPS say something to the other...
                         
                          CLAY
           Go.
          Roque FIRES UP THE ENGINE as the COPS get out of the
          cruiser. Pulling smoothly into the street...
                         
          EXT. MOTEL SIX -- AFTERNOON
                         
          Roque pulls up to their shitbeater Motel. Tension still
          between them. He gets out, turning back to his friend:
                         
                          ROQUE
           I was there too. I remember. But
           he won. We lost.
                          (PAUSE)
           Maybe it's time for a new game.
           23.
                         
          With that, Roque heads to the Motel. Clay looks down at
          his quarter eaten burger. He needs some real food...
                         
          INT. BUSTER'S BOOZE & BURGERS
                         
          Clay at the bar, eating a steak and drinking alone. Honky-
          tonk on the juke, mix of sawdust and blood on the floor.
                         
          A YOUNG WOMAN enters - she's hot, feels familiar. Clay
          eyes her as she orders a drink, dodges several GUYS.
                         
           PARTICULARLY OFFENSIVE GUY
           Yabba Dabba Doo...
                         
          She catches Clay's eye. Rolls her eyes. Clay's paying
          more attention to his T-Bone than the girl. She slides
          up next to him. Her name's AISHA.
                         
                          AISHA
           Men.
                         
          Clay turns back to his food. Not used to attractive women
          instigating conversation. Aisha watches as Clay eats.
                         
                          AISHA (CONT'D)
           How's the steak?
                         
                          CLAY
           Meaty.
                         
          She's still watching him. It's getting annoying.
                         
                          CLAY (CONT'D)
           Want a bite?
                          AISHA
           I don't eat red meat.
                         
                          CLAY
           Why not?
                         
                          AISHA
           Slows me down.
                         
                          CLAY
           Okay.
                         
          Aisha studies Clay. If we've been paying close attention,
          we might ID her as the race track binocular chick. We're
          not sure if Clay does.
           24.
                         
                          AISHA
           You got nice arms.
                         
                          CLAY
           (turning to her)
           I know you?
                         
                          AISHA
           Relax, slugger... I like arms.
           That's all.
                         
                          CLAY
           Do I not look relaxed?
                         
                          AISHA
           No.
                          (PAUSE)
           Think we can change that?
                         
           SMASH CUT TO:
                         
          INT. HOLLYWOOD, FL. - GOLD COAST MOTEL - LATER
                         
          Clay and Aisha enter his motel room. Aisha checks out
          the sparse accommodations.
                         
                          AISHA
                          (DEADPAN)
           Wow, it's everything a girl could
           dream of. Got a bathroom?
                         
                          CLAY
           No, I specifically requested the
           only hotel room in the world that
           doesn't have a bathroom.
                          AISHA
           You lookin' to turn a "yes" into a
           "no" here?
                         
          Clay points to the bathroom.
                         
          INT. HOLLYWOOD, FL - GOLD COAST - BEDROOM / BATHROOM
                         
          Aisha checks herself in the mirror. A touch of lip gloss.
                         
                          AISHA
           So what brings you to Florida?
                         
          Clay IN THE BEDROOM. Leans over - stretching his
          hamstrings. Does a few subtle twists - Loosening up.
           25.
                         
                          CLAY
           Convention.
                         
           AISHA (O.S.)
           Convention for what?
                         
          Shit. Clay looks around. Weakly:
                         
                          CLAY
           ...Air conditioners.
                         
          IN THE BATHROOM - Aisha studies herself in the mirror.
          Stretching her arms, prepping for some physical activity...
                         
                          AISHA
           They have whole conventions devoted
           to air conditioners?
                         
          IN THE BEDROOM
                         
                          CLAY
           You'd be surprised.
                         
          Aisha comes back out. Both now stretched and loose.
                         
                          AISHA
           Bet I would. Where were we?
                         
          They study each other. Aisha slowly moves towards Clay.
                         
                          CLAY
           You were about to tell me how much
           you enjoy spending time at the dog
           track...
          Aisha smiles, tracing her fingers down his stomach...
                         
                          AISHA
           Saw me there did you?
                         
          Clay strokes her cheek...
                         
                          CLAY
           Uh-huh...
                         
                          AISHA
           Didn't see me at the McDonald's
           though...
                         
          Their lips, inches from touching...
           26.
                         
                          AISHA (CONT'D)
           I have a proposition for you...
                         
          WHAM! Clay DECKS HER. She REELS BACK -- LOADED GLOCK up
          and out and -- Clay ducks left -- BACKHANDS HER with his
          forearm -- sends her FLYING across the room -- PAUSE.
          Both breathing hard. Staring at one another:
                         
                          AISHA (CONT'D)
           Just hear me out. I don't want to
           hurt you.
                         
                          CLAY
           You're not going to.
                         
                          AISHA
           Yes, I am.
                         
          He foot-plants, spins, re-attacks and IT IS ON! INSANELY
          VISCOUS: tearing the room to utter shreds. Fists
          SMASHING. A FACE KICK, plaster SMASHES.
                         
          She HURLS a twenty six inch color TELEVISION at him.
          This EXPLODES against a wall. Sparks give to flame as
          the room starts to burn hot around these two warriors...
                         
          They continue to fight like RABID WOLVES. And they're
          GRINNING. Enjoying this. THEN FREEZE --
                         
          AISHA ON TOP OF CLAY -- Each has a BUCK KNIFE up and tight
          against the other's throat. Blades on skin. TIE GAME.
          Neither giving. FLAMES AROUND THEM:
                         
                          AISHA (CONT'D)
           Room's on fire.
                          CLAY
           Noticed. What do you want?
                         
                          AISHA
           Your life. Back.
                         
          Clay spits blood and sucks air.
                         
                          CLAY
           You want to clarify that?
                         
                          AISHA
           Max. I can help you.
           27.
                         
          This clearly has effect on Clay - Substantial Effect.
          Clay stares up at Aisha. FLAMES ALL AROUND THEM...
                         
                          CLAY
           I'm listening.
                         
          EXT. HOLLYWOOD, FL STREETS -- NIGHT
                         
          Clay and Aisha walk away from the BURNING MOTEL.
                         
                          CLAY
           How'd you find me?
                         
                          AISHA
           It's not too tough if you know
           where to look. You guys aren't
           exactly subtle.
                         
          A FIRE ENGINE screams past them towards the burning hotel,
          as if to illustrate her point.
                         
                          CLAY
           How'd you know I was alive?
                         
                          AISHA
           Counted the number of teeth found
           in the safehouse debris in Karachi.
           Not nearly enough for five men.
                         
                          CLAY
           Who else knows?
                         
                          AISHA
           That you're alive? Just me.
                          CLAY
           So what's to stop me from putting
           a bullet in your head?
                         
                          AISHA
           You want Max and I can tell you
           how to get him.
                         
                          CLAY
           Max is up to something big, isn't
           he? Agency wouldn't have sent you
           otherwise.
                         
          She gives a little smile.
           28.
                         
                          AISHA
           Nice try, but I'm working alone
           here. If I wasn't, I wouldn't
           need your help. Ready for the
           important part?
                         
          Clay nods.
                         
                          AISHA (CONT'D)
           There is a plane.
                         
                          CLAY
           Okay.
                         
                          AISHA
           This plane contains a truck.
                          CLAY
           Okay.

           Right. So you want me to steal
           some super secret cargo known only
           to you and the bad guy, and I'm
           supposed to do this because you
           know the name Max and look good in
           a pair of jeans? Sorry, sister.

           Cargo's heroin. Max uses it to
           fund his off the books ops. And
           it comes straight from the poppy
           fields of the late Jamal al-Fadhil.

           scientific genius. Granted his
           weight signaled that he had certain
           impulse control issues, but that's
           no reason to throw his fat ass out
           a fifty story window.

                          AISHA
           You know, you are a sharp one--and
           don't let any of these other boys
           tell you different.
                         
          With that, she turns and walks away into the shadows.
          Roque lowers the weapon. A beat. To Clay:
                         
                          ROQUE
           I don't like this.
                         
                          CLAY
           I picked up on that.
                         
                          POOCH
           I'm with Roque, man. Agency thinks
           we're dead. We show up alive and
           kickin', start waving our dicks
           around in public, they're gonna
           make it their business to bury us.
           They'll call us terrorists, all
                          KINDSA SHIT-
                         
                          CLAY
           What do you think we are now?
           (to all of them)
           Best case scenario, this gets us
           face to face with Max-
                          ROQUE
           What if it doesn't? What if we
           never get face to face with him.
           Are you gonna be able to live with
           that? Ever?
                         
          Clay doesn't reply. A pall, cast over the guys. Finally:
                         
                          POOCH
           Hell, let's just say it out loud...
                          (PAUSE)
           We do this, we're declaring war on
           the Central Intelligence Agency.
                         
          Silence, as the guys take this in. Then, from the corner:
           50.
                         
                          COUGAR
           They started it.
                         
                          SMASH TO:

          SWOOPING DOWN over the waterways, threading our way between
          buildings, past the islands slamming into
                         
          EXT. PRIVATE AIRPORT, NEW ORLEANS
                         
          A G-550, tire chalked. A fork lift removes a large VAULT-
          LIKE PACKAGE from the back of the plane -- THE CARGO.
                         
          A fifteen ton ATTACK-STABILIZED CASH TRANSPORT RIG idles,
          surrounded by TWENTY ASSAULT TROOPERS, loading up. Machine
          guns, frag grenades, body armor.
                         
          BY THE JET -- WADE and FENNEL, our briefcase bomb friends,
          talks with a G. Gordon Liddy wrinkle muscleman.
                         
                          FENNEL
           As of this moment, the truck is
           designated an extraterritorial
           zone of immunity. Under no
           circumstances whatsoever are you
           or your men to allow the package
           to leave the truck before it's
           secure in the compound - to do so
           would be considered an act of
           treason and punishable as such.
                         
                          LIDDY
           Understood and acknowledged, sir.
          As the package is loaded into the MONSTER ARMORED RIG...
                         
                          WADE
           Ten men ride with the package and
           another ten ride chase.
                         
          Ten rock hard WARRIORS in a beefed up chase van.

          EXT. PRIVATE AIRPORT -- DAY
                         
          The two truck armored convoy pulls out of the private
          airport and passes a parked TOWN CAR...
           51.
                         
          INT. TOWN CAR - SAME
                         
          Clay, Roque, and Jensen watch the armored trucks pass by.
          Roque has a silenced long gun out as the second truck
          passes. As Roque PULLS THE TRIGGER...
                         
          EXT. PRIVATE AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS
                         
          A silenced AIR BLAST -- we TRAVEL FAST with Roque's
          ordinance -- SMACKING SILENT onto the rear bumper of the
          lead truck. A ballistic, putty-coated recon tracker.
                         
          INT. TOWN CAR - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Jensen's laptop GPS goes hot. Green dot indicates CONVOY.

           Target is westbound. Heading for
           the bridge...
                         
          Clay fires up the Town Car and follows.
                         
          AERIAL -- LOOKING DOWN as the armored cars head towards
          the city. TILT UP to reveal the CRESCENT CITY CONNECTION --
          eight suspended lanes spanning the Mighty Mississippi...
                         
          EXT. CRESCENT CITY CONNECTION
                         
          HIGH ANGLE -- Looking down at the bridge traffic. Sliding
          into frame, buckle-harnessed and very armed --
                         COUGAR
                         
          TWO HUNDRED FEET ABOVE GROUND. Lashed into a BRIDGE
          SUPPORT. He racks the bolt of his NTW-20 ANTI MATERIAL
          RIFLE - a monster of a weapon with a bulky starlight scope.
                         
          As the FIRST SWAT TRUCK reaches the center of the BRIDGE --
                         
           CLAY (O.S.)
           Take em'.
                         
          Cougar FIRES --
                         
          And everything begins happening very fast.
           52.
                         
          The SWAT TRUCK'S nearside front wheel EXPLODES, blown
          clear off the axle mount --
                         
          The wheel spins away, bounces wild, smashes a windshield --
                         
          INT. SWAT TRUCK -- FRONT CAB -- DAY

                          SWAT DRIVER
           Shit, I'm losing it!
                         
          The Truck SLEWS sideways -- PLOWS into a car! The Driver
          SLAMS the truck in reverse, FLOORS IT --
                         
          EXT. CRESCENT CITY CONNECTION -- DAY
          Cougar FIRES AGAIN -- the other front wheel DETONATES,
          and the truck's nose SLAMS down on the asphalt GRINDING
          SPARKS! Going nowhere fast...
                         
          THE CHASE VAN
                         
          Screeches to a hard stop behind. SECURITY CREW OUT --
          WEAPONS RAISED -- taking up DEFENSIVE POSITIONS. Ice
          cold professionals.

          EXT. TOWN CAR
                         
          Now at the entrance to the bridge. Roque smiles as he
          hefts an MGL-40 GRENADE LAUNCHER. FIRING...
                         
          BY THE CONVOY
                         
          THICK TEAR GAS EXPLODES in dark blues, billowing across
          traffic. SECURITY MEN CHOKE, lost in the SMOKE...
                         
                          WADE

           53.
                         
          COUGAR pumps a round into the EMPTY CHASE VAN -- Armor-
          glass BLASTING APART, showering the roadway -- Fennel
          DIVES for cover, PANICKING -- Lifts the radio to his lips:
                         
                          FENNEL
           Code RED! We are under attack!
           Need Chopper Support right now!
                         
          ROQUE fires another TEAR GAS GRENADE into the melee --
          CIVILIANS running and screaming -- TOTAL PANDEMONIUM --
                         
           CONTROL (V.O.)
           Acknowledged, EVAC is enroute!
                         
          As the CHASE VAN is BLOWN APART behind them! Fennel trying
          to orient through smoke and gas. Then, a NEW SOUND...
          DEEP RUMBLING. Thick bass vibrations...
                         
          The thick tear gas being blown aside by the thunderous
          twin-rotor downwash of a CHINOOK HEAVY LIFT CHOPPER!
                         
          It bellies in low, the boarding ramp already lowering...
                         
          Wade crouch-runs to the SWAT TRUCK, HAMMERING the rear
                         DOORS --
                         
                          WADE
           Cavalry's here!
                         
          The doors BURST OPEN and the SWAT Team CRASH-ROLLS the
          precious CARGO CRATE towards the Chinook's boarding ramp --
                         
                          WADE (CONT'D)
           Move! Point cover! Go, go!
          INT./EXT. CHINOOK HELICOPTER -- DAY
                         
          SWAT Guys laying down point cover as their comrades hustle
          the crate into the Chinook's WINDOWLESS HOLD. The ramp
          RISING as Fennel dives onboard as well...
                         
          BY THE CONVOY
                         
          Wade makes a "take off" sign to the Chinook pilot who
          flips him a salute as THE CHINOOK LIFTS INTO THE AIR...
                         
          The ramp closing. The team and cargo safely aboard...
           54.
                         
          EXT. CRESCENT CITY CONNECTION -- UPPER SUPERSTRUCTURE
                         
          Passing Cougar's sniper-harness, which now HANGS EMPTY.
          Twisting in the wind.
                         
          As we hear the rotors fade into the distance...
                         
          EXT. CRESCENT CITY CONNECTION -- DAY
                         
          Wade slumps against the burnt out wreckage of the chase
          van. Sighing in relief. SILENCE. His radio crackles:
                         
           CHOPPER PILOT (V.O.)
           This is Chopper Support--we are
           inbound your position, ETA five
           minutes! Hang in there!
          As a HORRIFIED LOOK OF REALIZATION crosses Wade's face
          and he stares up into the sky...
                         
          INT. CHINOOK -- WINDOWLESS HOLD -- DAY
                         
          The SWAT Guys pull off their masks and high-five. They
          think they kicked ass. Fennel, reaching for the cockpit
          door handle... He can't turn it.
                         
                          FENNEL
           What the hell? It's welded shut!

          INT. CHINOOK COCKPIT -- DAY
          We hear the FAINT YELLING of Fennel and the Swat Guys in
          the hold. The Chinook Pilot flips up his goggles to reveal --
                         
          It's POOCH! AISHA sitting co-pilot. Both grinning as
          they hear the protestations from behind them...
                         
                          FADE TO:

          The middle of nowhere. A small clearing. Skeeters and
          crickets harmonize. Clay waits with Jensen and Roque.
          THE CHINOOK crests the tree line. Hovers above...
           55.
                         
          INT. CHINOOK -- WINDOWLESS HOLD -- EVENING
                         
          Fennel and the SWAT Guys try to maintain balance and
          personal dignity as they stumble and fall all over each
          other... The chopper SETS DOWN. The men gather
          themselves. Weapons up. Checking clips, safeties off.
                         
                          FENNEL
           We're down, okay! You go the second

          EXT. CHINOOK -- EVENING
                         
          Aisha clambers onto the Chinook's hull, clutching a RUBBER
          HOSE. Screws the end to an inlet valve marked "FIRE
          RETARDANT SYSTEM". Looks down at Clay. With a grin:
                         
                          AISHA
           Open the valve.
                         
          TIGHT ON a 3-inch turn valve. Hard hands grab and open...

           surprise of their lives...
                         
          Cut off as a CLEAR LIQUID begins to rain down on them
          from the SPRINKLER SYSTEM...
                         
                          FENNEL (CONT'D)
           What the hell they trying to do,

           Sir, that smell! It's- gasoline!
                         
          Their EYES GO WIDE...
                         
          HYDRAULICS WHINE. The RAMP LOWERS. The gas drenched
          soldiers BURST OUT, weapons up. Squinting through the
          fumes...
                         
          CLAY STANDS ALONE. The men fan out around him. Multiple
          rifles TRAINED AT HIS HEAD from every direction. Fennel
          blinks, surprised to see him alive. Nevertheless:

                          CLAY
           So this hard drive - it contains
           evidence of what Max has been doing?
                         
                          FENNEL
           Yes!

                          FENNEL
           I don't know where it is! They
           don't let me have access! But-
                         
          Fennel goes pale when he sees Clay MOVE TOWARD HIM:

           No, wait! Please don't kill-
                         
          Clay plasters DUCT TAPE over Fennel's mouth. Stepping
          outside the Chinook. The others, going with him...
                         
          EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- NIGHT
                         
          The Warhead, still sitting there. Nobody speaks for a

          Roque stares at him.

          The Sergeant rises, and we follow him through the station
          towards the front doors. Moving faster and more nervously

          FENNEL. Eyes wide with fear. DUCT TAPED TO THE WARHEAD.
                         
          A SIGN hangs around his neck that reads Death to America!

           Meditate. Cultivate serenity.
           Much less difficult. You want to
           buy atomic bombs... I'm afraid
           that is a more difficult way of
           life.
                         
          And he smiles...

          Wade drives in a Jeep, heading back to the city.
                         
                          WADE

                          MAX
          That's a lot of a paper routes...

          Can we swing it?
                         
                          MAX
          Not even close.
                         
                          WADE
          The Company?
                         
                          MAX
          Won't give it to us willingly...
                          (THINKING)
          You get that six man team together
          like I asked?
                         
                          WADE
          Yeah.
                         
                          MAX
          Change of plans. Kill them.
                         
                          WADE
          Kill them?
                         
                          MAX
          Or fire them, whichever's easier.
                         
                          WADE
          Honestly? Firing them.
                         
                          MAX
          Fine, fine, I'm not a detail guy.
          What I need- wait. Did you give
          them intel on Clay's people?
                         
                          WADE
          Well, yeah.
                         
                          MAX
          Aaaand we're back to killing them.
                         
                          WADE
                          (ANNOYED)
          Fine, I'll kill them - what are we
          doing instead?
           71.
                         
                          MAX
           Touchy, touchy. Jeez, what are
           you related to them?
                         
                          WADE
           Actually, one of them, yes.
                         
                          MAX
           By blood?
                         
                          WADE
           (he's had it)
           A brother-in-law, I said I'd kill
           him, what are we doing?
                         
                          MAX
           It's not what we're doing, it's
           what Clay is going to do for us...
                         
                          WADE
           And that is?
                         
                          MAX
                          (GRINNING)

          INT. OUTSIDE HOUSTON - BEAT TO SHIT MOTEL ROOF - NIGHT
                         
          Clay. Sitting on his bed. Shirt off. Going over
          schematics - GOLIATH WORLD HEADQUARTERS. A KNOCK on Clay's
          door. He gets up, checks the eye hole. Opens it. AISHA.
                         
                          CLAY
           I was just going over the plan.
                         
          She looks at him. Sexual. Predatory.
                         
                          CLAY (CONT'D)
           You want to go over the plan?
                         
          She steps into the room towards him. Reaching for her:
                         
                          CLAY (CONT'D)
           Let's go over the plan...

          Clay and Aisha. After. Looking out at the city.
                         
                          AISHA
           So, what really happened to you in
           Afghanistan?
                         
          Clay looks over at her. Down at the TEDDY BEAR tattoo...
          And shakes his head.
                         
                          CLAY
                          (SOFTLY)
           That's not for you.
                         
          She traces her fingers over it...
                          CLAY (CONT'D)
           Why do you want Max dead?
                         
          Aisha, taken aback by the suddenness of the question.
                         
                          AISHA
           He's a bad man. Isn't that enough?
                         
                          CLAY
           No.
                         
          A beat. She looks at him.
                         
                          AISHA
           When you tell me about Afghanistan?
           I'll tell you about Max.
                         
                          CLAY
           Fine. It's hot. There's lots of
           sand. Your turn.
                         
          Aisha smiles at this. Shaking her head.
                         
                          AISHA
           Why were you alone when I found
           you?
                         
          That takes Clay off guard. Looking out at the city.
                         
                          CLAY
           The guys got sick of it.
                         
                          AISHA
           Sick of what?
           73.
                         
                          CLAY
           Of hearing about Max. Of hearing
           me say we had to do something when
           there wasn't anything to do. They
           wanted to be around their families.
           Jensen has a sister. Pooch has a
           wife and daughters.
                         
                          AISHA
           And he hasn't told them he is alive?
                         
                          CLAY
           Would you? The people you loved
           the most, would you put them in
           that kind of danger?
          Aisha, side-stepping the question:
                         
                          AISHA
           So Roque has no one.
                         
                          CLAY
           He's got me.
                         
                          AISHA
           And you have...
                         
                          CLAY
           Enough hate to get us both through
           the day. He stuck with me when no
           one else would. And I ain't the
           easiest guy to stick with.
                         
          Aisha studies him.
                          AISHA
           If you two really fought, he would
           kill you, I think.
                         
                          CLAY
           You think.
                         
                          AISHA
           I'm almost sure of it.
                         
                          CLAY
           Why?
           74.
                         
                          AISHA
           Because you care what happens to
           the others. You wouldn't put them
           at risk to save yourself.
                         
                          CLAY
           And you think that's a weakness.
                         
                          AISHA
           I know it is. Law of the jungle.
                         
                          CLAY
           We're not in the jungle.
                         
          She looks at him.
                          AISHA
           Oh, yes we are...
                         
          INT. VAN -- MORNING
                         
          Idling. Blacked out windows. Pooch behind the wheel,
          Cougar shotgun, Roque in back. Back door slides open and
          Clay and Aisha enter. Together. It doesn't go unnoticed.
                         
                          ROQUE
           Well, that's just great.
                         
          That's it. Fed up, Pooch SHUTS THE ENGINE like dad in
          the family truckster.
                         
                          POOCH
           We're not going anywhere until you
           two squash this shit.
                          CLAY
           Pooch, we're on a schedule here-
                         
          Pooch takes the keys out of the ignition and folds his
          arms. Clay sighs. Looks over to Roque. A beat. Then:
                         
                          CLAY (CONT'D)
           Sorry I hit you.
                         
                          POOCH
           Good. Roque?
                         
          A longer beat...
                         
                          POOCH (CONT'D)
           Roque?
           75.
                         
                         FINALLY:
                         
                          ROQUE
           Sorry I threatened to cut your
           head off.
                         
                          POOCH
           Verrrry good. Now don't you two
           feel better?
                         
           CLAY AND ROQUE
                          (IN UNISON)

                          POOCH
           I don't give a shit, I do.

           Now, let's go watch Jensen single-
           handedly knock over the largest

          JENSEN heads towards the building. Street bicycle, bike
          shorts, messenger bag. He's disguised as a Bike Messenger.
                         
                          JENSEN

          Jensen enters the reception area singing. Moves to the
          receptionist desk. A PRETTY RECEPTIONIST answering phones.
                         
                          JENSEN
                          (STILL SINGING)

           no thinking maybe, we're in love...
                         
          He looks down at the Receptionist...

          The Receptionist looks up. She's on the phone, distracted:
                         
                          RECEPTIONIST
           Excuse me one moment-
                          (TO JENSEN)
           I'll take that, thank you.
                         
                          JENSEN
           No can do, chica, gotta put it in
           his hands. He's gotta sign.

           I'm sorry--could you say that again?

           Babydoll, I'm on the clock here!
                         
          The Receptionist looks up at Jensen, not particularly
          amused. She points towards the elevators.

          COLLIDING with it's TWIN CHOPPER on the right -- they
          both twist and hink up -- their ROTORS SLICING INTO EACH
          OTHER -- both FINALLY CAREENING ONTO THE FREEWAY BEHIND
                         
          Our guys. Driving away from the carnage of two exploding
          Cobra Helicopters splattered across the road...
                         
          Safe.

          INT. LEAR JET 550 -- DAY
                         
          As it taxis towards a HANGAR. Max straightens his suit.
          Wade on the phone, frowning. Bad news. He flips the
          phone shut. To Max:
                         
                          WADE
           They got away.
                         
                          MAX
           So?

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           (off Wade's look)
           We know exactly where they're going,
           Wade. Port of New York, for their
           big final awesome stand against
           the forces of evil where they die.
                         
          He claps Wade and the shoulder and heads down the steps...
                         
          INT. HANGAR -- DAY

                          SHORT SCIENTIST
           Do you have the money?
                         
                          MAX
           Jesus, always with the money! So
           impersonal! How are you? How
           have you been?
                         
                          SHORT SCIENTIST
           I recently attended the funeral of
           my best friend who you had thrown
           out a window. How have you been?
                         
                          MAX
           Can't complain. I'm thinking of
           getting satellite radio in my car...
                         
                          SHORT SCIENTIST
           I think you're a freak. Too much
           Ronald McDonald. Too much fantasy
           football.
                         
          Max smiles and spreads his arms...
                         
                          MAX
           Hey, I'm all about the bombs, baby.
                         
                          SHORT SCIENTIST
           We have your ordinance. You have
           twenty four hours to get the money.
                         
          Max looks over to Wade.
                         
                          MAX
           Time to go make a withdrawal...
           92.
                         
          As he turns back to the plane...
                         
                          SHORT SCIENTIST
           New change of plan. You stay.
                         
                          MAX
           I've got to go get your money.
                         
                          SHORT SCIENTIST
           He'll get your money. You stay
           right here.
                         
          A PAUSE as Max contemplates this little twist.
                         
                          MAX
           God, are you short.
                          SHORT SCIENTIST
           Twenty three hours, fifty nine
           minutes...
                         
          Max looks at Wade.
                         
                          MAX
           Get it done.
                         
          Wade heads for the jet. Max watches him go. As Wade
          boards the jet Max takes a big sigh. For the first time,
          looks like a guy who might not be quite as sure of things
          as he would like. Max Looks back to the Short Scientist.
                         
                          MAX (CONT'D)
           How much do you weigh? Seriously.
                         
                          SHORT SCIENTIST
           I do not think you are funny.
                         
                          MAX
           Where the hell is my bomb?
                         
          The Short Scientist points to a large flatbed pick-up. A
          HEAVY TARPED BOMB LIKE PACKAGE strapped to the back.
                         
                          SHORT SCIENTIST
           You do not get it till I get the
           money.
                         
                          MAX
           For a guy who's all about
           transcending materialism, you talk
           about money so much!
           93.
                         
                          SHORT SCIENTIST
           If you keep talking, Pop-Amm will
           cut your mouth out of your face.
                         
                          MAX
           Fine...
                         
          INT. MEDICAL SUPPLY STORE -- NIGHT
                         
          After business hours. A WINDOW SMASHES. Roque climbs
          inside. Goes to the front and unlocks it for the others,
          who carry a BLEEDING JENSEN in. They lay him on a table.

           She burned us, Clay.

                          CLAY
           I know.

                          (RE: JENSEN)
           Cougar?
          Cougar nods. Gathers gauze, needle, thread, and a WOODEN
          DOWEL. Comes over as Jensen looks at the last one.
                         
                          JENSEN
           What's that for?
                         
          Cougar SHOVES IT BETWEEN JENSEN'S TEETH as an answer...
                         
                          POOCH
           So we split up again. Right?
                         
          Clay doesn't respond...
                         
                          POOCH (CONT'D)
           Right?

                          ROQUE
           Pooch...
                         
                          POOCH
                          (IGNORING HIM)
           Goddammit, Clay, whatever she knows,
           Max knows! It's over!
                         
          His words echo through the room.
                         
          JENSEN SCREAMS through the dowel as Cougar sews him up...
                         
          This is how low they've sunk. Clay finally looks up.
                         
                          CLAY
                          (SLOWLY)
           Okay. We split up. Some of us
           should go international. I'll do
           that if nobody else wants to-
                         
                          ROQUE
           So we just run again?
                         
          Clay turns to him.
                         
                          CLAY
           There's nothing else we can do...
                         
          Silence. Then:
                         
                          ROQUE
           There's something we can do.
                         
          A beat.
                          CLAY
           Excuse me?
                         
                          ROQUE
           Three years is enough. If there's
           a drive at that port that we can
           use to get clear-
                         
                          CLAY
           What part of "he knows we're coming
           for it" do you not get? They're
           gonna be waiting for us. Par-Sec
           is gonna waiting for us...
           95.
                         
                          ROQUE
           So figure out a way around them;
           you're good at that shit, Clay!
                         
          He turns, addressing all of them:
                         
                          ROQUE (CONT'D)
           We run now, we're gonna be running
           forever. This is our one chance
           to get our lives back...
                          (TO CLAY)
           To steal them back. And I'm
           prepared to do anything to any one
           to make that happen.
                         
          He looks Clay dead in the eye.
                          ROQUE (CONT'D)
           Never play a longshot, you're never
           gonna win.
                         
          A long beat. Clay, not breaking his look with Roque:
                         
                          CLAY
           Pooch, what's the minimum time to
           scout the patrols, get an accurate
           head count on-site at the Port?
                         
                          POOCH
           48 hours, but Aisha knows that-
                         
                          CLAY
           So we hit them in twelve.
                         
          Roque smiles. Pooch blinks.
                          POOCH
           Twelve hours from now? You mean--
           you want us to go in blind?
                         
                          ROQUE
           Last thing they'll expect...
                         
                          POOCH
           Yeah, cause it's dumb.
                         
                          CLAY
           Jensen's already got the layout,
           and Cougar can spot on site. Right?
                         
          Cougar nods. He's in.
           96.
                         
                          CLAY (CONT'D)

                          JENSEN
           Yeah, cause gettin' shot is
           awesome, I'm totally up for doing
           it again...
                         
          He gives a weak thumbs-up. In. All that's left is
                         
                          CLAY
           Pooch?
                         
          Pooch, struggling with the decision...
                         
                          POOCH
           Last time we went in blind on an

                          CLAY
           So?
                         
          A beat. Pooch looks up.
                         
                          POOCH
           So let's go get it back.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          EXT. NEW YORK HARBOR -- DAWN
                         
          ESTABLISHING. The harbor is enormous. A small TWIN
          HURRICANE BOAT cuts through the morning waves. Half mile
          from the Goliath docks. At the controls, Clay and Roque.
          THROUGH CLAY'S BINOCULARS:
                         
          GOLIATH EMPLOYEES going about their business, preparing
          for a tanker docking. All seems normal until we look a
          bit closer: FOUR-MAN Par Sec security patrols. Bomb
          sniffing DOGS. Two Cobra ATTACK CHOPPERS.
                         
                          CLAY
           You ready?
                         
          A GOLIATH TANKER approaches from behind. Roque looks
          back at the tanker. Not answering - he seems to have
          something on his mind.
                         
                          CLAY (CONT'D)
           Roque?

                          ROQUE
           I'm ready.
                         
          Clay drops the twin throttles and spins the speed boat
          towards the APPROACHING TANKER. Several TUGS and SECURITY
          LAUNCHES are maneuvering around it...
                         
          INT. SECURITY LAUNCH - NEW YORK HARBOR
                         
          Clay and Roque approach one of the launches from behind.
          Climbing aboard. They take the two SECURITY MEN from

          In the corner, Wade nods at this. Behind him, A LARGE
          SEMI pulls up to the CASH CONTAINER. Over the following,
          a hydraulic lift hoists the cash container onto the truck:

           Oh, we're not gonna kill you.
           Someone's gotta get away with the

          Clay stares at daggers at both of them.

          The Guards handcuff Clay and drag him to his feet. Pushing
          him towards the door. As he hustled past Roque:

          Clay stares back at him.
                         
                          CLAY
           You're going to die very badly.
          The guards hustle Clay out the door...
                         
          EXT. GOLIATH TERMINAL - DAY
                         
          PAR-SEC GUARDS lead the Pooch, Jensen, and Cougar towards
          the far end of the terminal. Each, bound. Cougar looks
          up to see a separate set of Guards leading CLAY the
          opposite way. Their eyes connect - both knowing:
                         
          They've lost.
                         
                          CLAY
           (answering the question)
           Roque.
                         
          Cougar lowers his head, sadly. Clay's pushed into A TRUCK.
                         
          Gone.
          The Guards take Pooch, Jensen, and Cougar BEHIND A
          WAREHOUSE. Looking at each other. Knowing, this is the
          end of the line. The Lead Guard RACKS HIS MACHINE GUN.
                         
                          LEAD GUARD
           On your knees.
                         
          Pooch SPITS AT HIM. The Lead Guard calmly SHOOTS HIM in
          BOTH LEGS!
                         
          Pooch SCREAMS. Falls. The Par-Sec boys force Cougar and
          Jensen down too, CLUBBING THEM with their rifles. Pooch
          looks up at his assailant. Gasps through the pain:
                         
                          POOCH
           Get on with it...
           105.
                         
          The Lead Guard smiles. Looks to Cougar, who's shredding
          his skin to the bone trying to claw out of the cuffs...
                         
                          LEAD GUARD
           That's a nice hat.
                         
          He steps forward to take it, but Cougar is too quick for
          the man, MOVING HIS HEAD AWAY. He reaches for Cougar
          again. Again, Cougar evades. The guards laugh at their
          colleague, who continues trying to grab Cougar's hat.
                         
          The Lead Guard has had enough of Cougar's antics.
          Levelling the rifle at his head...
                         
           LEAD GUARD (CONT'D)
           Don't really care of there's a
           hole in it. One wash, good as...
                          (NOTICING)
           What are you smiling at?
                         
          Cougar's nods past him...
                         
          As the Guards turn to see ON TOP OF AN OIL TANK...
                         
                         AISHA
                         
          As she rises up to standing, A SLANT-K 600 ROCKET HIP
          BLASTER locked and loaded. Looking like an Old Testament
          style Goddess of Vengeance and Destruction. A moment of
          FROZEN SHOCK on the rest of Wade's Hit Crew...
                         
          And she pulls the trigger. A HIGH PITCHED WHISTLE as
                         
          THE ROCKET STREAKS across the Terminal! Headed straight
          for an ENORMOUS FUEL TANK...
          KA-BOOM! The explosion ROCKS THE ENTIRE TERMINAL...
                         
          INT. TRUCK (MOVING)
                         
          The Truck Clay is prisoner in is BLOWN INTO THE AIR by
          the SHOCKWAVE... SMASHING down onto it's side, skidding...
                         
          EXT. BY THE WAREHOUSE
                         
          Cougar and Jensen DESTROY the remaining Par-Secs with
          legs. Grabbing cuff keys and freeing themselves.
                         
                          JENSEN
           Shouldn't have gone after the hat...
           106.
                         
          WHAM! Cougar kicks the Guard in the face, knocking him
          cold. Aisha rappels off the Oil Tower in the distance.
          VARIOUS PAR-SEC TEAMS fire at her! Cougar scoops up two
          rifles and tosses one to Jensen - they give her covering
          fire as she comes! As he shoots, to the wounded Pooch:
                         
                          JENSEN (CONT'D)
           Can you stand?
                         
                          POOCH
           I've been shot in both legs, what
           kind of dumbass question is that?
                         
                          JENSEN
           Oh, so we're Mr. Grumpy now? You're
           not the only one who's been shot
           recently, you know!
                         
          He empties a full clip into a Par-Sec team and reloads...
                         
          AISHA -- Pinned down forty yards away. Almost out of
          AMMO. Par-Sec Team, almost on top of her when
                         
          A FIGURE emerges from an OVERTURNED TRUCK. GUN in each
          hand, BLAZING. The Par-Secs cut down one by one. The
          figure lowers his guns. Desert Eagles. Walks up to her.
          Underneath the blood, oil, and grime, it's
                         
          CLAY. They stare at each other...
                         
          Then, incredibly, Aisha RAISES HER WEAPON AT HIM.
                         
                          AISHA
           Did you kill my father?
          Jensen comes running up, interrupting:
                         
                          JENSEN
           Clay?
                         
                          CLAY
           Kind of in the middle of something
           here, Jensen-
                         
                          AISHA
           Did you kill him?
                         
                          JENSEN
           There was no drive, Clay-
           107.
                         
                          CLAY
           (eyes on Aisha)
                          I KNOW-
                         
                          JENSEN
           There was no drive and Roque's
           gone and Par-Sec's regrouping and
           Pooch could bleed out-
                         
          Aisha's had enough, thumbing the hammer back:
                         
                          AISHA
           Did you kill him?
                         
          Clay, about to respond when:
           COUGAR (O.S.)
           I did.
                         
          They turn to see our LONG TALL SNIPER standing above them.
                         
                          COUGAR (CONT'D)
           He asked us. It was mercy. But
           you're his family, so I understand.
                         
          And then, incredibly, Cougar lays his rifle at her feet.
                         
          SURRENDERING...
                         
                          COUGAR (CONT'D)
           But only me.
                         
          Clay and Jensen blink, shocked. Aisha stares at Cougar,
          equally surprised. She levels her pistol AT HIS HEAD...
          Silence. We CUT WIDE to see...
                         
          A GUNSHOT. Muzzle flash from Aisha's gun. COUGAR FALLS...
                         
          In close again. Aisha stands over Cougar's body.
                         
          The others, stunned... And then Cougar rises. Face
          BLOODY. Cheek ripped open, from where the bullet creased
          his flesh. She FIRES AGAIN - BLAM!
                         
          Identical scar on his other cheek. Blood runs down his
          face. He doesn't move to wipe it away.
                         
                          AISHA
           Wear it. Remember him.
           108.
                         
          Cougar nods. Leans down, picks up his rifle. Debt paid.
                         
                          JENSEN
           Okay, excellent, very tribal--We
           need to go.
                         
          As if on cue, BULLETS kick up DUST around them! A new
          Par-Sec team, incoming. Clay, Jensen, Aisha, and Cougar
          hightail it back to where Pooch lies.
                         
                          CLAY
           Can you stand?
                         
                          POOCH
           This is stupid question day, isn't
           it? It's stupid question day and
           someone forgot to tell me...
                         
          Clay slings Pooch over his shoulders fireman carry style.
          Looks across the Terminal to where Pooch's van is parked.
          PUSH IN on Clay's face for:
                         
                          CLAY
           Let's go.
                         
          And they do. Sprinting across the open space IN SLO-MO,
          Cougar and Aisha WASTING EVERYTHING THAT MOVES. A full
          on ballet of fully automatic mayhem...
                         
          They make it to the van! Piling in! Cougar behind the
          wheel GUNS THE ENGINE and they PEEL OUT...
                         
          INT. VAN (MOVING) -- NIGHT
                         
          Pulling on to the HIGHWAY. Silence sets in. The high of
          the firefight, over. Just pain and loss now.
                         
          Five people, some terribly wounded, with nowhere to go.
          Just the rocking of the van as it heads down the road.
                         
                         FINALLY:
                         
                          CLAY
           They won. We lost. Way it goes.
                         
          Silence.
                         
                          POOCH
           Way it always goes.
                         
          Clay looks at him.
           109.
                         
                          POOCH (CONT'D)
           Guess we should just head home.
           Oh, wait, that's right. We don't
           have homes.
                         
          Clay doesn't respond. Aisha studies him. Nods. Knows
          what has to be done. They all do. From behind the wheel:
                         
                          COUGAR
           Where to, Colonel?
                         
          Clay looks up at the use of rank...
                         
          EXT. PRIVATE AIRSTRIP -- NIGHT
                         
          Wade pulls up in a Corvette. Gets out and walks over as
          Roque finishes supervising Par-Sec guards finish loading
          the CASH onto a HUGE TRANSPORT PLANE.
                         
                          WADE
           Your friends jack-rabbitted. Should

                          ROQUE
           Clay doesn't take risks. It's why

                          WADE
           You're sure?
                         
          Roque nods.
                         
                          WADE (CONT'D)
           Can I ask you something? Why'd
           you stick with those losers for so
           long?
                         
          Roque considers. Then:
                         
                          ROQUE
           They were good guys.
                         
          Wade half smiles at this. Shaking his head.
                         
                          WADE
           No such thing. I'll go call Max.
                         
          He begins walking towards HANGAR...
                         
          CRACK! As the FENCE by the AIRSTRIP is SMASHED INWARDS
          by the Van! Headed straight for him! Clay, WAVING:

          WADE raises his UZI and FIRES - Taking out the Van's front
          tires! THE VAN Flips! Smashing end over end, finally
          coming to a rest on it's side! Climbing out, groaning:

           Fine, let's go kill Wade...
                         
          ON THE RUNWAY
           111.
                         
          Cougar guns the engine, catching up to the TAXIING
          TRANSPORT PLANE. Clay leans out the window, shooting at
                         
                         ROQUE
                         
          Huddled in the plane's CARGO HOLD, RETURNING FIRE. The
          PILOT, yelling to him.
                         
                          PILOT
           We don't have enough runway to
           take off - we're going to have to
           turn around and come back to get
           up to speed!
                         
                          ROQUE
           Fine, just get us in the air!
          He fires ANOTHER BURST from his weapon at the Vette!
          CLICK - his WEAPON DRY.
                         
                          ROQUE (CONT'D)
           I'm out!
                         
          IN THE CORVETTE -- SIMULTANEOUSLY, Clay, WEAPON DRY.
                         
                          CLAY
           I'm out.
                         
          He stares through the windshield to look at Roque.
                         
                          CLAY (CONT'D)
           Get me closer...
                         
          INT. HANGAR -- NIGHT
          Jensen enters, carrying a MACHINE GUN.
                         
                          JENSEN
           Yoo-hoo! Wade!
           (a'la the Warriors)
           Come out and plaaaayyy-
                         
          The ROAR of an engine -- Jensen DIVES out of the way as
          Wade WHIPS PAST on a MOTORCYCLE! Heading for the runway!
                         
                          JENSEN (CONT'D)
                          (INTO RADIO)
           Hey, Wade's coming at you! I...
                         
          He trails off. Looking at THE LEAR JET that Wade arrived
          in. Sitting in the Hangar's Corner. Keys the radio...
           112.
                         
                          JENSEN (CONT'D)
           I think I just found our way out
           of here...
                         
          EXT. AIRSTRIP -- DAY
                         
          The Corvette, pulling behind the still lowered REAR RAMP
          of the TRANSPORT PLANE! Clay, onto the CORVETTE'S HOOD...
                         
          Roque, rising to meet him. Waiting for him...
                         
          Clay JUMPS! Landing on the ramp!
                         
          IN THE CARGO HOLD - Roque smiles. Pulls a WICKED LOOKING
          KNIFE. The two men stand there. Sizing one another up...
                          ROQUE
           Gotta admit, I always wondered how
           this would play out.
                         
                          CLAY
           Aisha thinks you kill me.
                         
                          ROQUE
           It's a distinct possibility...
                         
          They begin circling one another. Clay, still weaponless.
                         
                          ROQUE (CONT'D)
           You don't have a knife?
                         
                          CLAY
           Don't need one.
                         
                          ROQUE
           Bit of as longshot for you...
                         
                          CLAY
                          (SMILING)
           No. It's not.
                         
          Roque LUNGES AT HIM...
                         
          But Clay does have a knife. He PULLS IT and SLAMS IT
          into Roque's belly! Roque, stunned! Staggers back...
                         
          For most men, that would be the end of the fight. But
          not these two. Roque gives Clay a bloody grin.
           113.
                         
                          ROQUE
           Now I really am gonna cut your
           head off...
                         
          He LUNGES AGAIN! And now it is FULLY ON...
                         
          The blades whip up and down - almost too fast to see
          Roque gets Clay with a left cross, then buries his knife
          in Clay's shoulder. Clay twists free, slashes at Roque.
                         
          Ten seconds in, the men separate again. Breathing hard...
                         
          Clay sees Roque doesn't have his knife. Looks - realizing
          it's still embedded in his own shoulder. Pulls it out,
          TOSSES IT BACK TO ROQUE. They stand there, both panting...
          Then RUN AT EACH OTHER full tilt!
                         
          Here's how it ends. And pay attention, IT HAPPENS FAST:
                         
          Clay goes low -- coming up to grab Roque's knife hand,
          which is arcing DOWNWARDS TOWARDS CLAY'S THROAT -- Clay
          manages to HALT THE HAND, blade inches from his Adam's
          apple -- and there's a moment where Roque could overpower
          him and actually cut his head off... But Clay THROWS HIS
          WEIGHT FORWARD and BREAKS ROQUE'S RIGHT ARM!
                         
          And for the first time, Roque SCREAMS.
                         
          Which seems to make Clay happy.
                         
          So he BREAKS ROQUE'S LEFT ARM too.
                         
          Roque falls to his knees, BROKEN, BLOODY, AND BEATEN...
          TO REVEAL -- The PILOT. Leaning out of the cockpit, DESERT
          EAGLE levelled at Clay.
                         
                          CLAY
                          SHIT-
                         
          The Pilot PULLS THE TRIGGER. The bullet slams into Clay's
          abdomen and BLOWS HIM off his feet backwards -- FLYING
          OUT OF THE PLANE -- And landing on hood of
                         
                         THE CORVETTE
                         
          Clay SMASHES DOWN ON the windshield -- Cougar pumps the
          brakes and spins the wheel -- desperately trying to keep
          Clay from rolling off the hood...
           114.
                         
                         THE PLANE
                         
          TURNING AROUND at the end of the runway. Beginning it's
          final run to get up to speed...
                         
                         THE CORVETTE
                         
          Now driving TOWARDS IT on a chicken-like collision course
          when WHOOSH! WADE FLIES PAST ON HIS MOTORCYCLE! Clay
          turns to Cougar through the spiderwebbed windshield:
                         
                          CLAY (CONT'D)
           Rifle...
                         
          Cougar passes Clay his SNIPER RIFLE and FLOORS IT...
          VISUALIZE THIS --
                         
          AT ONE END OF THE RUNWAY, the plane starting to take off.
                         
          AT THE OPPOSITE END, Wade's motorcycle heading full speed
          at the approaching plane. Cougar and Clay, chasing Wade.
                         
          And then AISHA steps out INTO THE MIDDLE of the runway.
          The ROCKET LAUNCHER clutched in her hands.
                         
          She takes a knee. Aims at the plane, which is almost at
          lift speed. ROQUE sees her from the cockpit.
                         
          She locks eyes with him and GRINS -- FIRING into the
          LANDING GEAR of the plane AS...
                         
                         THE CORVETTE
                         
          PULLS EVEN WITH WADE. Instead of shooting, Clay THROWS
          Cougar's RIFLE BETWEEN THE SPOKES of Wade's FRONT TIRE,
          causing the bike to
                         
          CATAPULT WADE OFF and FORWARD...
                         
          ...THROUGH THE AIR and into the RIGHT NUMBER TWO JET ENGINE
          of the now flying cargo plane. The ENGINE EXPLODES.
                         
          Aisha, somehow safe on the ground, looking up at the
          escaping plane. Clay looking up. All of them watching...
                         
          ...as Roque dies very badly.
                         
          WHOOMP! The big plane EXPLODES in a MONSTER FIREBALL--VA
          DOOOM! Burning gas and iron and cash. FIRE RULES.
           115.
                         
          ON THE GROUND
                         
          Our guys. Bloody, eyes bitterly triumphant. Clay stares
          at the sight before him. Only one word for it.
                         
                          CLAY (CONT'D)
           Outstanding.
                         
          Jensen approaches, supporting Pooch.
                         
                          JENSEN
           Not to rain on everyone's we killed
           all the bad guys parade, but we
           should probably get gone - legless
           Pooch has a Learjet all gassed up
           for us in the Hangar.
           (off Pooch's look)
           It's a cool name-
                         
          From the smashed up bike Wade was driving, WADE'S CELL
          PHONE RINGS. Clay gets off the hood of the Vette and
          Cougar and Aisha help him hobble over. Answering it:
                         
                          CLAY
           Hello?

           We good?
                         
          TIGHT ON CLAY realizing who he's talking to.
                          CLAY
           Not by a longshot. You're not
           having a real great day, Max.

                          CLAY
           Just a voice on the phone.
                         
                          MAX
           Where's Wade?
                         
                          CLAY
           Working on the engines.
           116.
                         
          A beat as it hits Max.
                         
                          MAX
           Clay.

           It's Colonel.
                         
          In the distance, SIRENS.
                         
                          MAX
           Colonel, yes. Well done.

           Thank you.
                          MAX
           I understand you've always wanted
           to meet face to face. I'm sure
           that could be arranged...
                         
          A beat. Then:
                         
                          CLAY
           I don't think the guys you're about
           to stiff for a billion dollars are
           going to allow that to happen.
           (looks to the others)
           We win. You lose. Goodbye.
                         
          He snaps the phone shut and tosses it into the fire.
          Turns to the others.
                         
                          CLAY (CONT'D)
           Lear jet?

                          (GRINNING)
           Ready when you are.
                         
          Pooch, Jensen, and Cougar start for the Hangar. Clay
          looks to Aisha. A moment between them.
                         
                          AISHA
           I wanted to find and punish those
           responsible for my father's death.
           Max, his men, everyone.
                         
                          CLAY
           That why you slept with me?
           117.
                         
                          AISHA
           That and the cardio.
                         
          Clay smiles.
                         
                          CLAY
           You coming?
                         
          A beat. She nods.
                         
                          AISHA
           I'm coming.
                         
                          CLAY
           Good cause there's no way I could
           walk it...
          She helps him up and we begin to PULL UP AND BACK as they
          head for the Hangar. Together.
                         
          INT. NORTH INDIA -- HANGAR -- DAY
                         
          Max lowers the phone. Looking stunned. The Short
          Scientist has run out of patience.
                         
                          SHORT SCIENTEST
           Time is up, Stretch.
                         
          Max looks at the Short Scientist.
                         
                          MAX
           Stretch. That's a good one.
                         
          But he doesn't look like he's very amused.
                          SHORT SCIENTEST
           Because you are so much taller
           than I.
                         
                          MAX
           Yeah, no, I get it...
                         
          Momentary pause. The Short Scientist looks at Max. Slowly
          gets up, LEAVES MAX alone in the room with the ten Indians.
          Max takes a deep breath, looks up at the DEATH SQUAD.
                         
                          MAX (CONT'D)
           You gentlemen consider yourselves
           to be soldiers or businessmen?
                         
                          CUT TO:
           118.
                         
                         BLACK SCREEN
                         
          We think it's the end. But then we hear
                         
          WIND. Blowing through trees. Crickets. The soft sound
          of evening television. Somewhere suburban...
                         
          FADE IN ON:
                         
          EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE -- NIGHT
                         
          A nice quiet neighborhood. Outside the kitchen window
          Pooch's wife JOLENE, doing dishes in the sink again.
                         
          A RUSTLING. Jolene looks up this time. She obviously
          heard it. She puts down the dishes and goes to the door.
          Opens it and looks out to see...
                         
          Nothing. Not even by the swingset.
                         
          She sighs. About to head back inside when she spies
                         
          A GLINT OF LIGHT. By the oak tree in the front. She
          steps outside. Walks down until she sees what it is.
          Her breath hitches in her chest.
                         
          A frilly purple ribbon is tied around the old oak tree.
                         
          And now there are tears in Jolene's eyes. Because she
          knows what it means.
                         
          Her husband is alive. And he will make it home.
                         
          Someday.
                         FADE OUT
