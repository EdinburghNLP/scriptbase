     MRS BROWN BY JEREMY BROCK

     EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

     Begin on black.  The sound of rain driving into trees. 
     Something wipes frame and we are suddenly hurtling through
     a forest on the shoulders of a wild-eyed, kilted JOHN
     BROWN.  Drenched hair streaming, head swivelling left and
     right, as he searches the lightening-dark.  A crack to his
     left.  He spins round, raises his pistol, smacks past
     saplings and plunges on.

     EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

     Close-up on BROWN as he bangs against a tree and heaves for
     air.  A face in its fifties, mad-fierce eyes, handsome,
     bruised lips, liverish.  He goes on searching the dark. 
     Stops.  Listens through the rain.  A beat.  Thinking he
     hears a faint thump in the distance, he swings round and
     races on.

     EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

     BROWN tears through the trees, pistol raised at full arm's
     length, breath coming harder and harder.  But even now
     there's a ghost grace, a born hunter's grace.  He leaps
     fallen branches, swerves through turns in the path, eyes
     forward, never stumbling once.

     EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

     BROWN bursts into a clearing, breaks to the centre and
     stops.  With his pistol raised, he turns one full slow
     circle.  His eyes take in every swerve and kick of the
     wildly swaying trees.

     There's a crack and a branch snaps behind him.  He spins
     round, bellows deep from his heart:

                    BROWN
          God save the Queen!!

     And fires.

     Nothing happens.  The trees go on swaying, the storm goes
     on screaming and BROWN just stands there, staring into
     empty space.  A pause.

     Slowly, he starts to frown as the fact begins to dawn on
     him that he is alone.  He stares at the thrashing trees,
     waving their mocking arms at him.  His hand lets the pistol
     drop to his side.  He feels the rain drench down his face. 
     And now, for the first time, we see that his socks have
     fallen to his ankles and his knees are cut to shreds.  He
     shifts a foot.  His dress-shoes are covered in mud.  He
     goes on staring into the dark.  Nothing. 
     Just the wind and rain.  Gradually, we pull back, higher
     and higher.  As we do, we hear the quiet cultivated voice:

                              FADE TO BLACK.

     CAPTION: "1864"

                              FADE IN:

                    PONSONBY (V.O.)
          I have sent for a Mr. John BROWN from
          Balmoral.  Her majesty has mentioned
          him, on one or two occasions, as being
          a most devoted outdoor servant to
          Prince Albert during his last days
          there...

     John BROWN is now just a tiny figure dwarfed by the storm.

                               CUT TO:

     INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN VICTORIA'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

     The screen is black.  As the camera pulls back, we discover
     that we are looking at a black night-gown.

     Queen VICTORIA is sitting at her dressing table, while an
     elderly HAIRDRESSER, also in black, works at her hair.

                    PONSONBY (V.O.)
          ... The depths of the Queen's sorrow
          remain impenetrable.  She has now
          restricted herself to a regime of such
          ferocious introspection that we are
          all at our wits' end...

     INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, PRINCE ALBERT'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

     A bust of the Prince Consort is draped in black.  His desk
     is laid out as if for work.  A VALET is brushing one of his
     suits before laying it carefully on the bed.

                    PONSONBY (V.O.)
          ... The Household continues, at her
          instruction, to observe the rituals
          now so familiar to her, in a vain
          attempt to render vivid that which can
          never be revived...

     Close-up on a small table as a shaving brush is placed
     carefully beside a dish of freshly poured water.

     INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN VICTORIA'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

     The hairdresser is pulling VICTORIA's hair back into the
     widow's cape.  For the first time, we see her face.  It is
     set in a mask of severity.

                    PONSONBY (V.O.)
          ... It will not surprise you to hear
          that she continues steadfast in her
          refusal to accept any public
          engagements, however trivial...

     INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN VICTORIA'S BEDCHAMBER - DAY

     A bronze cast of Prince Albert's hand hangs above the Royal
     bed.  His sleeping-gown is laid out on one side.

     A somberly dressed middle-aged man stands by the bed:
     DOCTOR JENNER, the Queen's physician.  He is placing
     potions and medicaments in a row on the bedside table.

     Behind him, TWO MAIDSERVANTS are busy stripping and
     remaking the bed while another raises the window to air the
     room.

                    PONSONBY (V.O.)
          ... Family and staff expend all their
          efforts endeavouring to draw her out
          of this state of unfettered morbidity,
          but to no avail.  Indeed, Doctor
          Jenner will not undertake to vouchsafe
          her sanity, unless some remedy is
          found...

     INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN VICTORIA'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

     VICTORIA is turning slowly around as a young ASSISTANT
     DRESSER completes the fastening on her black crepe dress.

                    PONSONBY (V.O.)
          ... We must hope, therefore, that this
          Mr Brown will appeal to the Queen's
          sentimental, though deeply-held, view
          that all Highlanders are good for the
          health.  If she can at least be
          persuaded to take the air, the
          prospect of further recovery may seem
          less remote...

     The assistant dresser pulls too tightly on her dress. 
     VICTORIA winces slightly.

                    ASSISTANT DRESSER
               (terrified)
          Sorry, ma'am.

     EXT. THE SEA FRONT, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY

     We glide slowly past the coastline as a caption reads:
     "ISLE OF WIGHT. 1864."

     A DRIVER stands against the sea front with a horse and cart
     bearing the Royal coat of arms.

     John BROWN leads his pony along the dockside, towards the
     waiting driver.  He is in his late thirties, fit, handsome
     and dressed in tartan kilt and short jacket.

                    PONSONBY (V.O.)
          ... He is arriving by boat this
          afternoon, by which time it is hoped
          Her Majesty will be in a fit state to
          consider riding out...

     INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, PRIVATE SECRETARY'S ROOM - DAY

     SIR HENRY PONSONBY, the Queen's Private Secretary, is
     sitting at his writing desk, completing a letter.

                    PONSONBY (V.O.)
          ... As to that decision, along with
          all others, we remain, as ever,
          prisoners of the Queen's grief.
               (beat)
          Ever your devoted husband, Henry.

     He folds the letter and slips it into an envelope.  He is a
     middle-aged man in a dark mourning suit; tall, Saturnine
     and with a civil servant's stoop.  As he looks up, we see a
     white-stockinged FOOTMAN standing to attention by the door. 
     PONSONBY hands the letter to him.

                    PONSONBY (CONT'D)
          Windsor.

     CAPTION: "OSBORNE HOUSE, ISLE OF WIGHT"

     INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, CORRIDOR AND QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY

     A series of windows are being slammed open by white
     stockinged FOOTMEN as members of the ROYAL FAMILY and UPPER
     HOUSEHOLD hurry by in silence, all dressed in mourning and
     rushing to make the luncheon hour.

     INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S DRAWING ROOM - DAY

     Queen VICTORIA heads down the empty corridor with two
     ladies-in-waiting, LADY ELY and LADY CHURCHILL, hurrying
     along a pace behind.

     INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY

     Members of the Royal family and upper household hurry into
     the icy dining room and take their designated places at the
     luncheon table.  Everybody is dressed in mourning and
     nobody speaks.  Wind whistles through the open windows. 
     Silence.

     Among the diners we catch our first glimpse of BERTIE, the
     Prince of Wales.  He is in his mid-twenties, plump, stiff
     dressed and balding.  He stands next to his young wife,
     PRINCESS ALEXANDRA, who fiddles nervously with her shawl,
     trying to keep warm.

     As BERTIE smooths down his thinning hair, DOCTOR JENNER
     bustles into the dining room, stands himself next to
     PONSONBY and proceeds to conduct a hurried conversation
     with the Prince of Wales, entirely in whispers.

                    JENNER
          Congratulations, Your Royal Highness!

                    BERTIE
          Thank you, Doctor.

                    JENNER
          A boy, I hear.  Excellent, excellent.

                    BERTIE
          Yes.
               (beat)
          Albert Victor.  Eddie for short.  What
          do you think?

                    PONSONBY
          A fine choice, sir.

                    JENNER
          Excellent!

     EXT. DOCKSIDE, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY

     JOHN BROWN leads his pony gently up the ramp and into the
     carrier bearing the Royal coat of arms.  The DRIVER leans
     in.

                    DRIVER
          Are you riding up front?

     BROWN looks straight at this man, quiet and reserved.

                    BROWN
          I'll stay with the pony, thank you. 
          She's all the way from Deeside and
          she's not sure she likes you yet.

     The DRIVER shrugs and slams the doors on them.

     INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, CORRIDOR AND QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY

     VICTORIA reaches the dining room door and takes a deep
     breath.  LADY ELY and LADY CHURCHILL stop a pace behind.

                    VICTORIA
          How many?

     LADY ELY is slightly taken aback.

                    LADY ELY
          The Royal Family and senior members of
          the household, ma'am.

                    VICTORIA
          Just them?

                    LADY ELY
          Yes, ma'am.

     VICTORIA closes her eyes, then steels herself and steps
     through the door.

     INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY

     Everyone stiffens as VICTORIA walks in.  Acknowledging the
     other diners with a quick nod, the Queen takes her place.

     She flaps open her napkin and, bang on cue, everyone else
     sits and does the same.  The meal is served immediately by
     waiting SERVANTS, who plonk the food down without ceremony.

     It's a very ordinary meal of meat and vegetables.  VICTORIA
     starts eating heartily, straight away.  Everyone does the
     same.

     Only the clink of cutlery and the same eerie silence.

     EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE, THE GROUNDS - DAY

     The Royal horse-carrier rattles into the grounds and on
     down the driveway past the beautiful, manicured lawns
     stretching away towards the ornate twin towers of Osborne
     House.  A few outdoor servants watch its progress
     curiously.

     INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY

     The silence continues as VICTORIA finishes her plain
     pudding.  Immediately, servants appear at every place and
     whip away the pudding bowls whether their owners have
     finished or not.  Nobody thinks this odd; it is part of the
     routine.  DOCTOR JENNER clears his throat.

                    JENNER
          We're expecting Brown this afternoon,
          ma'am.

                    VICTORIA
          Whom?

     A beat.  VICTORIA takes a sip of water, dabs her mouth with
     her napkin and rises.  Everyone else rises too.  Suddenly,
     the Queen turns to Bertie's nervous wife, PRINCESS
     ALEXANDRA, and proclaims abruptly:

                    VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          That's a very pretty shawl you are
          wearing, Alex.  Silk suits you well.
               (beat)
          But you are not eating enough.  One
          must not let vanity overrule one's
          appetite.

                    PRINCESS ALEXANDRA
          Yes, ma'am.

     VICTORIA nods earnestly.  Lost to the effect her words have
     had, she marches out again.  Behind her, she leaves
     PRINCESS ALEXANDRA feeling humiliated and crestfallen in
     front of all the others.  BERTIE takes her hand and
     squeezes tight, trying awkwardly to console.

     EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE - DAY

     The horse-carrier pulls up outside the servant's entrance
     and the DRIVER opens the doors.

     JOHN BROWN pulls out a watch from his waistcoat and checks
     the time.  His eyes narrow critically.

                    BROWN
          I was due at a quarter past one.
               (beat)
          You're late.

     INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, CORRIDOR - DAY

     A few minutes later, JOHN BROWN strides down the long
     corridor with PONSONBY at his side.  Their journey takes
     them down an endless series of corridors, past servants and
     householders hurrying about their duties.  The presence of
     the dead Albert is felt all around in the black-wreathed
     portraits and busts that crop up along the way.

     BROWN and PONSONBY could not be more contrasted.

                    PONSONBY
               (in low tones)
          Her Majesty's routine at Osborne House
          is not as you will remember it.  The
          Household remains in full mourning and
          no-one is permitted to raise their
          voice under any circumstances
          whatsoever.  As for the Queen's
          routine, she breakfasts at nine
          thirty, lunches at two,takes tea at
          five thirty and dinner at eight forty
          five.  No one is allowed to leave the
          building while the Queen is at home. 
          On the rare occasions when she is out,
          you may ask permission to leave, but
          only with my consent. 
          You're to be ready to walk the pony at
          any time after ten o'clock.  You'll
          clean her outdoor things and do any
          odd jobs as and when she requires.

                    BROWN
          How will I know?

                    PONSONBY
               (surprised to be interrupted)
          I'm sorry?

                    BROWN
          How will I know what she requires?

                    PONSONBY
          You'll be sent a message.

                    BROWN
          Who'll bring it to me?

                    PONSONBY
          Her Highness' Equerry.

                    BROWN
          I need a man who knows where I am.

                    PONSONBY
          I'm sure it won't be difficult to find
          you.

                    BROWN
          That's not good enough.

     A beat.

                    PONSONBY
          Then we'll have to see what can be
          arranged.

                    BROWN
          Aye, do.

     PONSONBY stiffens.  A beat.

                    PONSONBY
          There is to be no communication with
          other members of the household on
          matters concerning the court except
          through myself or one of the
          Equerries.  No plans must be altered
          unless you are given prior authority
          by myself or a senior member of the
          household.

                    BROWN
          I came down at the Queen's request. 
          I'll take my orders from her.

                    PONSONBY
          In matters concerning the Household, I
          act on her behalf.

     BROWN takes the measure of him.

                    BROWN
          Do you?

                    PONSONBY
          Yes.
               (beat)
          I do.

     BROWN glances up the corridor.

                    BROWN
          So, is passing wind out of the
          question or do I need permission for
          that?

     PONSONBY refuses to acknowledge what he has heard.  They
     reach the door of the Royal Chamber and he concludes the
     interview.

                    PONSONBY
          As I am sure you remember from
          Balmoral, you do not talk while in Her
          Majesty's presence unless Her Majesty
          addresses you directly.

     BROWN refuses to answer, so PONSONBY knocks.  After a
     moment, the door is opened by LADY ELY who ushers them in.

     INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S SITTING ROOM - DAY

     BROWN walks stiffly into the room and stops.  PONSONBY
     waits by the door.

                    PONSONBY (O.S.)
          Mr Brown, ma'am.

     VICTORIA is bent over the desk, working at one of her
     numerous red boxes.  She scribbles furiously at a letter,
     underlining and accenting words as she goes.  Finally, LADY
     ELY steps up to her side and whispers something in her ear. 
     She carries on working.

     BROWN has time to survey the room.  Dominating everything
     are the same black-wreathed busts and portraits of Prince
     Albert glimpsed in the corridor.

     Finally, VICTORIA nods and LADY ELY beckons BROWN forward. 
     He steps up in front of the desk and waits.  VICTORIA looks
     up and BROWN bows deeply.

     Silence.

     She stares at him for a long moment without apparently
     registering who he is.  He towers over her, in bright
     tartan, while she sits hunched in her seat, all in black
     and knotted with tension.

     Finally, she finds her voice.  She sounds nervous and edgy.

                    VICTORIA
          Mr Brown.

                    BROWN
          Ma'am.

                    VICTORIA
          You are here safely.

                    BROWN
          Aye, ma'am.

                    VICTORIA
          You are well?

                    BROWN
          I am.

                    VICTORIA
          And the pony?

                    BROWN
          She's well, too.

     VICTORIA blinks at the sight of him.  His presence is
     bringing him back.  A beat.

                    VICTORIA
          Your family sent cards.  It was much
          appreciated.

                    BROWN
          I'm glad of it.

     In an effort to control her emotions, VICTORIA now sounds
     the same severe note as at lunch.  But BROWN, unlike
     others, seems unaffected.

                    VICTORIA
          My husband was always very
          complimentary in speaking of you.  He
          would have approved, I am sure, of my
          calling on you in this way.
               (beat)
          I trust it does not inconvenience you
          too much.

                    BROWN
          I've no family, ma'am, apart from my
          brothers and sisters.

                    VICTORIA
          Yes.
               (beat)
          You have a brother in service here, do
          you not?
               (furrowing her brow)
          I forget his name.

                    BROWN
          Archie.

                    VICTORIA
          Yes.
               (beat)
          That will be company for you.

                    BROWN
          Yes, ma'am.

     Silence.  VICTORIA starts to tire.  She takes a sip of
     water and spills a little on herself.  Flustered, she
     searches for a hanky but cannot find one.  LADY ELY hurries
     up with one of her own and the Queen dabs it off.  BROWN
     watches all of this with genuine concern.  When VICTORIA
     finally looks up, he stares at her in deep sympathy.

                    BROWN (CONT'D)
          Honest to God, I never thought to see
          you in such a state.  You must miss
          him dreadfully.

     VICTORIA stares back in stunned silence.  PONSONBY coughs
     involuntarily.  LADY ELY freezes.  A beat.

                    VICTORIA
          You do not - he ... get him out.
               (beat)
          Get him out.  Get him out!

     Suddenly, BROWN finds himself tugged backwards out of the
     room.  LADY ELY rushes up to assist as VICTORIA shouts
     herself into a fit of uncontrolled sobbing.

     INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - DAY

     Some minutes later, BROWN is angrily unpacking a trunk. 
     His humiliation expresses itself in the extraordinary
     ferocity with which he slams down every object.

     His younger brother, ARCHIE, sits on the bed.  He's in his
     early thirties, bright, sharp and dressed in the same
     distinctive kilt and tweed.

                    ARCHIE
               (telling it fast)
          So the day they arrive, she greets the
          Sultan and his family with barely a
          word and then retires to her chamber. 
          The Sultan, not used to State
          Occasions without a head of State, is
          standing in the lobby waiting for
          someone to tell him what to do.  But
          the court is under strict instructions
          not to talk in the corridors so nobody
          speaks to him, not a living soul, for
          the whole afternoon.  So now it's
          dinner and everyone's standing round
          the table -- still not a word --
          waiting for Her Majesty to arrive. 
          One hour goes by, two, the Sultan's
          getting a wee bit peckish to say the
          least.  So finally, his wee laddy
          breaks for the cold meats and stuffs a
          slice in his mouth.  Well, the uproar
          when she heard.  You'd have thought
          someone had stolen the crown jewels.

     BROWN stares back, still pissed off.

                    BROWN
          So?

                    ARCHIE
          So, there are rules.  Things you do
          and things you don't do.

                    BROWN
          I was just telling the woman how I
          feel, for God's sake.

                    ARCHIE
          You don't tell Her Majesty how you
          feel.

                    BROWN
          I speak as I find, Archie.

                    ARCHIE
          Not down south you don't.

     BROWN slams a drawer shut.  ARCHIE lets it go and watches
     his brother.  A beat.

                    ARCHIE (CONT'D)
          So what did Ponsonby do when she
          started shouting?

                    BROWN
          I think he nearly ruptured his truss.

     A beat, then both men burst out laughing.

     INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, SERVANT'S HALL - DAY

     The clatter of voices and banging doors as under servants
     hurry about with plates, knives and forks, laying the Upper
     Servant's huge table for dinner.  ARCHIE leads BROWN
     through this rush of activity.

                    BROWN
          How much?

                    ARCHIE
          Seventy a year.

                    BROWN
          Not bad, not bad.

                    ARCHIE
          How about yourself?

                    BROWN
          Sixty.

                    ARCHIE
               (grinning)
          That's pretty good for a ghillie.

     BROWN smiles dryly.  They pour themselves a drink from the
     table.

                    BROWN
          Prince Leopold?  Is he the one who
          bleeds all day?  So what does his
          valet do?  Wash his poultices for him?

                    ARCHIE
          It's better than shovelling horse
          shit.

                    BROWN
          If you were looking for promotion, you
          should have picked one of the
          healthier ones.

                    ARCHIE
          She's hardly a full hamper herself.

                    BROWN
               (beat)
          It's only grief makes her like she is.

                    ARCHIE
          Three years, John.  Is that not a bit
          long to be grieving?

                    BROWN
          She loved him.

                    ARCHIE
          Come on, man.  There's love and
          there's ...

                    BROWN
          What?

                    ARCHIE
          You know what I mean.

                    BROWN
          I'm not sure I do, Archie.

                    ARCHIE
          There's love and there's behaving like
          you do because there's nobody to tell
          you not to.

     Hold on BROWN.  He lets it go and moves on.  Across the
     hall, he spots the pretty ASSISTANT DRESSER watching them.

                    BROWN
          Which one of us is she flirting with?

                    ARCHIE
          The good-looking one.

                    BROWN
          Aye?  Then she's obviously not got
          enough to do.

                    ARCHIE
          You work the system right, you could
          ask her yourself.  Just be thankful
          you're not working for Household.  The
          Queen never lets them out of her
          sight.  But wee spats like us can slip
          through the net, easy.

     A beat.  BROWN stares straight at him.

                    BROWN
          I'm no wee spat, ARCHIE.

     INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER CORRIDOR - MORNING

     The next day, VICTORIA and her ladies are hurrying down a
     corridor on her way into the dining room.  VICTORIA
     suddenly stops and stares out of the windows.  Her
     entourage are several steps past her before they realize
     what's happened and scurry back to take up their positions
     behind.

     Now we see what has caught her attention.  BROWN is
     standing in the courtyard below, by his pony.  She watches
     him for a moment, then without reacting, walks on.

     EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE - AFTERNOON

     Some hours later.  It is now raining.

     A gaggle of ROYAL GRANDCHILDREN hurry out of a carriage
     from their afternoon recreational while their NANNIES
     frantically try to keep them dry under the umbrellas.  John
     BROWN stands tall and erect on the gravel while they rush
     around him, laughing and giggling.

     INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER CORRIDOR - EVENING

     Rain on the window.  VICTORIA is walking in the opposite
     direction down the corridor with her entourage.  She stops
     at the same place as before.

                    VICTORIA
               (as if she had not seem him
                earlier)
          Who is that?

     Lady Ely peers through the rain.

                    LADY ELY
          It's Mr Brown, ma'am.

                    VICTORIA
          What is he doing there?

                    LADY ELY
          He appears to be ... standing by his
          horse.

                    VICTORIA
          I made no request to go out riding
          today.
               (beat)
          How long has he been there?

                    LADY ELY
          I don't know, ma'am.
               (nervously)
          He was observed earlier, I believe.

     At this moment, PONSONBY comes down the corridor.

                    VICTORIA
          Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing in the
          courtyard.  I have no wish to go
          riding.

                    PONSONBY
          I'm very sorry, ma'am.  I can't
          imagine -- he was certainly given no
          instructions.

                    VICTORIA
          Please make sure it does not happen
          again.

                    PONSONBY
          Of course, at once.

     VICTORIA takes one last look and walks away.

     INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, PRIVATE SECRETARY'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

     Half an hour later, PONSONBY stands at his desk facing
     BROWN.

                    PONSONBY
          What on earth did you think you were
          doing?

     BROWN stares straight back.

                    BROWN
          Awaiting my orders.

                    PONSONBY
          You do not report for duty unless the
          Queen requests it.  You know that very
          well.

                    BROWN
          I didn't come all this way to sit on
          my arse.

                    PONSONBY
          You will await your orders like
          everyone else.  Unless you prefer a
          repeat of yesterday's little
          excitement.

                    BROWN
          No.

                    PONSONBY
          I beg your pardon?

     INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER CORRIDOR - DAY

     The next day.  From a high window, we see PONSONBY
     scuttling madly across the courtyard towards the figure of
     JOHN BROWN, who is standing exactly as he was the day
     before.

     VICTORIA watches impassively.

     EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE, COURTYARD - DAY

     PONSONBY stands close to BROWN, shouting in his face.

                    PONSONBY
          I thought I made myself perfectly
          clear.  You do not leave your room
          until Her Majesty requests it.

                    BROWN
               (eyes straight ahead,
                shouting back)
          Well, you tell Her Majesty from me, if
          her husband was here now, he'd have
          had her out of that house and getting
          some air in her.  What the hell's the
          point in me being here otherwise?!

     From the window above, VICTORIA takes in his words.  A
     beat.  PONSONBY collects himself.

                    PONSONBY
          Go inside at once.

                    BROWN
          Is that the Queen's request?

                    PONSONBY
          Yes, it most certainly is!

     BROWN turns, grabs the lead rein and leads his horse back
     to the stables.

     INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, STABLES - DAY

     A few minutes later, BROWN is in the process of stabling
     his horse.  Suddenly he turns.

     VICTORIA is standing at the far end of the stable with her
     entourage.

                    VICTORIA
          Mr Brown.

                    BROWN
          Yes, ma'am.

                    VICTORIA
          You have been told repeatedly not to
          stand in the courtyard unless
          requested to do so.

                    BROWN
          Yes, ma'am.

                    VICTORIA
          Then why do you persist in doing it?

                    BROWN
          Because I think Her Majesty is wrong. 
          If ever there was a poor soul who
          needed fresh air, it is her.

     A beat.

                    VICTORIA
          The Queen will ride out if and when
          she chooses.

                    BROWN
          And I intend to be there when she's
          ready.

     Silence.  The two of them stare at each other.

     EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE, THE GROUNDS - DAY

     The next day, high and wide over the stunningly manicured
     landscape.  Long lawns, wind-cropped copses and in the
     distance, the glittering sea.

     EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE, THE GROUNDS - DAY

     VICTORIA sits side-saddle on a horse.  BROWN leads her in
     silence.

     EXT. CLIFFTOP - DAY

     VICTORIA looks up.

                    VICTORIA
          Prince Albert was going to build a
          bench here.  He thought it one of the
          best views in Osborne.

                    BROWN
          It's a fine spot, ma'am.

                    VICTORIA
          He thought so, yes.

     She stares ahead.

                    VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          In everything I do and everything I
          say, I try to think, as much as
          possible, what he would do, or say, if
          he were here now.  My Private
          Secretary wishes me to return to
          public duties--

     She stops abruptly, but BROWN cuts in.

                    BROWN
          If Prince Albert were here today, he'd
          tell him a thing or two.

                    VICTORIA
          Sir Henry is not alone.  They all wish
          it.
               (beat)
          The same people who refused to grant
          my husband the title of King because
          he was deemed of insufficient rank--

     She stops again, cutting quickly back to small-talk.

                    VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          It is a fine spot for a bench, is it
          not?

                    BROWN
          Aye, ma'am.

                    VICTORIA
          Yes.

     A pause.

                    VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          I have some letters in the saddle bag. 
          I wish to read them.

     BROWN walks up to her side, opens the saddle bag and hands
     her a bundle of letters held together with ribbon.

                    VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          I cannot read them like that.

     BROWN undoes the ribbon and tries again.  VICTORIA cuts in.

                    VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          You will hand them to me as I require.

     BROWN takes off the top letter and hands it to her.

     INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER SERVANT'S TABLE - NIGHT

     The clatter and crush of the Upper Servant's table as UPPER
     SERVANTS sit themselves down to dinner while UNDER SERVANTS
     prepare to serve soup.

     ARCHIE comes in and sits himself somewhere in the middle
     next to an empty seat.  A moment later, BROWN strides in.

     But instead of sitting at the place beside his brother, he
     goes straight to the head of the table and plonks himself
     down.  Slowly, the clatter dies away as the whole room
     stops and stares at him in silence.  BROWN fixes them with
     a look.

     An elderly butler steps into the room and stares in
     amazement at BROWN.  A smooth young man, BERTIE'S VALET,
     hurries up to intercede.

                    BERTIE'S VALET
          Mr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits
          there.

                    BROWN
          Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.

                    BERTIE'S VALET
          By whose authority?

                    BROWN
          My own.

     A little frisson of oh-my-gawdness.  BERTIE'S VALET stares
     icily at him.

                    BERTIE'S VALET
          The order of seating at the Upper
          Servant's table is arranged personally
          by the Queen herself.

                    BROWN
          That's a tautology lad.
               (unable to stop himself
                seriously explaining it)
          If you say the Queen arranges
          something, you've no need to say she's
          done it personally.  That's
          understood.

     But as far as BERTIE'S VALET is concerned, it isn't.  He
     stares down in mute fury, then snaps his fingers at one of
     the under servants, who rushes over.  There is a hurried
     exchange of whispers before the under servant rushes out.

     Unperturbed, BROWN brings out his flask and pours himself a
     substantial draft of whiskey.  He turns to the pretty
     assistant dresser, sitting to his right.

                    BROWN (CONT'D)
          Are you dresser to Her Majesty?

     She blinks nervously at him.

                    ASSISTANT DRESSER
          Assistant, sir, yes.

     BROWN tucks into his soup.  Everyone watches and waits.

                    BROWN
          What's your name?

                    ASSISTANT DRESSER
          Mary Taylor, sir.

                    BROWN
          Have I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary?

                    ASSISTANT DRESSER
          I hope to go up next year.

                    BROWN
          You wouldn't happen to know what the
          Queen's reading for recreation, would
          you, Mary?

     The assistant dresser thinks for a moment.

                    ASSISTANT DRESSER
          Lord Tennyson, sir?

     BROWN nods.  All conversation stops as the under servant
     bursts back in.  She halts at the door, looking blankly
     from Bertie's valet to the elderly butler.  A beat.  The
     old man stiffens and makes his way to the middle of the
     table.

     BROWN looks up from his soup.

                    BROWN
          Am I the only one eating?

     With a clatter of spoons, everyone obediently eats.

     INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, DRAWING ROOM - DAY

     A few days later.  A morning "drawing room."  Standing
     round the unlit fireplace are DOCTOR JENNER, LADY ELY, LADY
     CHURCHILL, the two LADIES IN WAITING and PRINCESS
     ALEXANDRA.  All are dressed against the icy wind that
     whistles through the open window where VICTORIA sits
     knitting busily while BERTIE stands beside her, coat
     buttoned up to the collar.  PONSONBY has stationed himself
     opposite, beside a desk piled high with red dispatch boxes. 
     He runs through the daily itinerary.

                    PONSONBY
          Lord Clarendon arrives, by invitation,
          at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve
          by a picnic in the grounds to
          celebrate Princess Alice's birthday. 
          Dispatches, as usual, at two.
               (finishes, then coughs)
          The Chancellor writes to say that, by
          happy coincidence, he will be in Cowes
          for the weekend.  He asks if Your
          Majesty might grant him an audience.

                    VICTORIA
          Why?

                    PONSONBY
          He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty
          might wish to be informed of the
          latest developments in government.

                    VICTORIA
          No.  I shall be out walking.

     A beat.  BERTIE watches closely now.  PONSONBY coughs
     again, nervous.

                    PONSONBY
          Then perhaps Your Majesty might
          consider it opportune if the Prince of
          Wales were to meet him on your behalf?

     VICTORIA stiffens.  She speaks without turning.

                    VICTORIA
          On no account.

     PONSONBY gives up.  Politely, but firmly, BERTIE takes up
     the reins.

                    BERTIE
          Mama, I really do think it's time we
          made ourselves a little more ...
          available.

     VICTORIA carries on knitting.

                    BERTIE (CONT'D)
          I think we must accept our position in
          the country is not entirely unrelated
          to the continued absence of the
          Monarchy from public life.
               (silence)
          I thought perhaps we might consider a
          small gesture of some kind?

     VICTORIA looks up sharply.

                    VICTORIA
          Gesture?

                    BERTIE
          I thought, a dinner for our
          ambassadors perhaps?

                    VICTORIA
               (cutting in firmly)
          No dinners, Bertie.
               (beat)
          Why are you dressed for outdoors?

                    BERTIE
          It's so infernally cold in here.

                    VICTORIA
          Cold is good--
               (calling across)
          Is that not so, Dr. Jenner?!

                    JENNER
          I'm sorry, ma'am?

                    VICTORIA
          Cold is good!

                    JENNER
          Excellent, ma'am, excellent.
               (trying his hand)
          But perhaps if her Majesty were to
          consider accompanying her new-found
          physical vigor with the benefits of
          mental activity...

                    VICTORIA
               (becoming very agitated)
          Why am I being lectured in this way?!

                    JENNER
          Forgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way
          did I wish to suggest--

                    VICTORIA
               (cutting across him)
          I will not tolerate anybody lecturing
          me about the responsibility of the
          monarchy....

                    BERTIE
          Mother....

                    VICTORIA
          ... Least of all my son.  It was his
          irresponsibility that drove my husband
          to his grave.

     An appalled silence.  With great dignity, BERTIE absorbs
     the shock of the insult and quietly steers the conversation
     in another direction.

                    BERTIE
          If it is inconvenient to Her Majesty,
          then perhaps she might consider
          allowing the Prince of Wales to host--

                    VICTORIA
          I do believe they send so many boxes
          to taunt me. 
          Doctor Jenner writes to them to say
          that my nerves are in an extremely
          fragile state and yet they continue to
          hound me with box after box after box
          after box after box!

     Silence.  VICTORIA has crossed to the window and stares out
     at the view.  Having recovered her composure, she turns to
     address them all.

                    VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          I wish to take the Princesses for a
          swim.

     For a moment, nobody believes what they have heard.  She
     continues.

                    VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          The turns I have been taking in the
          grounds have proved most beneficial to
          me, and Brown thinks that salt water
          will do me good.

     Bertie stares at her in silence while PONSONBY and DOCTOR
     JENNER exchange a worried look.

     EXT. PRIVATE BEACH, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY

     The doors of the Royal bathing-machine swing open and Queen
     VICTORIA, in a voluminous swim-dress, sails out like a duck
     into the freezing sea.  As she does so, the doors of the
     other machines open and Princess Helena and Princess Louise
     follow her in.  Dignity does not allow them to shout out,
     but their expressions of constipated agony are a picture.

     VICTORIA begins swimming around in a vigorous little
     circle.

                    VICTORIA
          Don't potter, children.  Swim.

     Hold for a moment on the princesses' miserable faces.

     EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE - DAY

     Half an hour later, PONSONBY, DOCTOR JENNER, LADY ELY and
     two FOOTMEN watch as BROWN helps VICTORIA up some steps and
     onto her horse.  He glances at the stiff line of
     householders and mutters curtly to himself.

                    BROWN
          You could buy that lot for garden
          ornaments and still see change from
          ten guineas.

     The household do not hear this, but QUEEN VICTORIA has
     overheard and tries to suppress a smile. 
     As she settles into the saddle, her foot comes loose. 
     BROWN fastens it into the stirrups.

                    BROWN (CONT'D)
          Lift your foot, woman.

     Everyone hears this.  VICTORIA obeys.  Taking the reins, he
     then walks the QUEEN out of the courtyard.  As they vanish
     from site, we hear...

                    DISRAELI (O.S.)
          This nation is fortunate in so much as
          it is not governed by force...

                              FADE TO BLACK.

     CAPTION: "1866"

                              FADE IN:

     INT. THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT - DAY

     The speech continues as we follow the progress of a
     Tomahawk cartoon doing the rounds of the Tory back benches
     from knee to knee.  It is entitled, "Where is Britannia?"
     and shows an empty throne draped with the Royal cloak.

                    DISRAELI (O.S.)
          ... but by a chain of traditions that
          have been cherished from generation to
          generation, because in them -- in our
          traditions -- are embodied all the
          laws which have enabled us to create
          the greatest empire of modern times...

     During the above, the cartoon reaches the front benches and
     lands on the knees of the young, earnest STANLEY.  As he
     frowns at the picture in front of him, DISRAELI winds up.

                    DISRAELI (CONT'D)
          ... but, even though we have amassed
          great capital and even though we have
          established an industry with no
          parallel in the world, yet all these
          mighty creations are as nothing
          compared to the invisible customs that
          shape our lives.  To those honorable
          gentlemen of the opposition who seek
          to destroy the essential elements of
          this country, I say let them remember:
          England cannot begin again.

     During this peroration, we see DISRAELI for the first time. 
     He is handsome, obviously Jewish and wire thin, like
     Dickens on Slimfast.  He dresses almost dandyishly but
     speaks with startling vigor; a combination of brilliance
     and cheek that is his key.  To cheers from his back
     benchers, he sits.

     As he looks up, he catches the eye of his opposite on the
     Liberal benches.  GLADSTONE is different in almost every
     respect; dour, dogged, heavy-set and tall.  They stare
     levelly for a second, then DISRAELI flashes a brilliant
     smile.

     STANLEY plops the cartoon on his lap.

                    STANLEY
          Have you seen this?

     INT. THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT, LOBBY CORRIDOR - DAY

     A few minutes later, DISRAELI and STANLEY are strolling
     down the busy lobby corridor.  Throughout their talk, Tory
     back-benchers bustle up to pat their hero on the back and
     offer their congratulations.

                    STANLEY
          Should we take it seriously?

                    DISRAELI
          The cartoon or Her Majesty's
          absenteeism?

                    STANLEY
          Well, both.

                    DISRAELI
          The question is, do we need her?

                    STANLEY
          Surely, you're not suggesting we
          dispense--

                    DISRAELI
          My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with
          only a handful of friends must respect
          public opinion.

     The pass GLADSTONE in a huddle of cohorts.

                    DISRAELI (CONT'D)
          Gossip counts.  Lord Aberdeen was
          right.  This country is not governed
          by wisdom but by talk.
               (beat)
          Granted, it wouldn't take much to
          winkle the old girl out of mourning,
          but if public opinion is against her,
          then it doesn't do to appear too
          close.

                    STANLEY
          So?

                    DISRAELI
          We'll see which way the wind blows.

     DISRAELI sweeps through a prattle of back-benchers.

     EXT. PUBLIC BEACH, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY

     BROWN and ARCHIE crash into the water.  It is freezing. 
     BROWN braces himself against the icy shallows by bellowing
     Burns at the sea.

                    BROWN
          My heart's in the Highlands, my heart
          is not here!  My heart's in the
          Highlands a-chasing the deer!  Chasing
          the wild deer and following the roe! 
          My heart's in the Highlands wherever I
          go!

     ARCHIE is so creased up with laughing, he almost drowns.

     EXT. PUBLIC BEACH, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY

     A few minutes later, BROWN and ARCHIE hurry back up the
     cold beach to rub themselves dry.  BROWN is very energized.

                    BROWN
          One box of biscuits, one box of drop
          tablets, one box of pralines, sixteen
          chocolate sponges.  It's the same
          order every week, but does anybody
          bother to check it?  Now she has to
          travel all the way to Balmoral without
          the few luxuries she actually enjoys.

                    ARCHIE
          So?  Someone'll send it on ahead.

                    BROWN
          Aye, but will they?

                    ARCHIE
          John, it's not your problem what she
          eats.

                    BROWN
          The woman's surrounded by fools!
               (beat)
          She has to be packed and ready to
          leave by seven thirty tomorrow
          morning.  Knowing that lot, they'll
          still be dressing her at eight.

     BROWN takes a nip of whiskey and offers some to his
     brother.

                    ARCHIE
          She's got an army of people to get her
          up and out.

                    BROWN
          But I'm the only one she trusts.

     ARCHIE stares at him.  A beat.

                    ARCHIE
          She'll blow hot and cold on you, John,
          she always does.  You want to be
          careful.

                    BROWN
          I'm on ninety pounds a year plus
          seventy pounds for a pile of tartan
          I'd be wearing anyway.  That's as much
          as a Page of the Back Stairs gets and
          that job's only for toffs.
               (raising his hip flask
                triumphantly at the sea)
          I'm Her Majesty's Highland Servant! 
          Indoors and Out.  There's no stopping
          me now.

     EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - NIGHT

     A few days later.

     The clatter of carriage and horse as the ROYAL PARTY
     thunders through gathering dark toward Balmoral Castle.

     CAPTION: "BALMORAL"

     EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - TWILIGHT

     A mass of torches encircle the ROYAL PARTY as kilted
     GHILLIES and STAFF swarm round the carriage, opening doors
     and clambering off boxes while a regiment of PIPERS play
     them in.

     Amid this swarm of activity, we glimpse BROWN opening the
     door to a smiling VICTORIA as she climbs down, followed by
     PRINCESS HELENA and PRINCESS LOUISE.  Emerging from another
     carriage come BERTIE and PRINCESS ALEXANDRA, staring grim
     faced at the castle.  HENRY PONSONBY and DOCTOR JENNER
     alight from their carriage as PONSONBY slips on his gloves
     and pinches his nose at the pain of remembrance.

                    PONSONBY
          Oh God, not the pipes!

     EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

     The next day.

     High over the vast, bleak mountains of Lochnager and Loch
     Muick.  VICTORIA and BROWN are riding fast towards the top. 
     Reaching the summit, VICTORIA points excitedly at the far
     horizon.

                    VICTORIA
          What are those?

                    BROWN
          What?

                    VICTORIA
          Those, over there, there.

                    BROWN
               (horse chestnut trees...)
          Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.

                    VICTORIA
               (beat)
          Craobhan-geanmchno...
               (bursts out laughing)
          How can I possibly say that with a
          straight face?!

     BROWN lets it go and they ride on.

                    VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          I am thinking of publishing my
          "Highland Journals."

                    BROWN
          Are they worth reading?

                    VICTORIA
               (beat)
          I am told so.

                    BROWN
          Who by?

                    VICTORIA
          Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are
          charming.

                    BROWN
          What does he know about the Highlands?

                    VICTORIA
          He has been attending at Balmoral for
          many years.

                    BROWN
          That doesn't make him an expert.

                    VICTORIA
          His remarks were directed at the
          quality of the writing, not its
          subject.

                    BROWN
          I don't groom a horse to have it
          admired by others, I groom it because
          it needs grooming.

                    VICTORIA
               (curtly)
          I do not do it for others.  But
          Ponsonby thinks they are good.

                    BROWN
          Just say what you have to say, woman. 
          What other people think shouldn't
          matter to you.

                    VICTORIA
               (snapping)
          Of course I shall say what I have to
          say.  I always do.

     The stare at each other until BROWN kicks his horse on.

                    BROWN
          Aye, well, if all you want is a good
          opinion then he'd be sure to oblige
          you.

                    VICTORIA
               (riding alongside)
          What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was
          their literary merit, a skill not
          intimately associated with the
          knowledge of grooming.
               (beat)
          Literary appreciation does not begin
          and end with Tennyson.

     BROWN lowers his head.

                    VICTORIA (CONT'D)
               (in a softer tone)
          I mention you in them.

     BROWN says nothing.

                    VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          In particular, the occasion when
          Albert was alive; the Royal Carriage
          overturned during a storm and you
          demonstrated such loyal service in
          returning the Queen and the Princesses
          safely to Balmoral.

     Taking a sprig of heather from her brooch, VICTORIA holds
     it out to him.  A beat.

                    VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          For friendship.

     INT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY

     A few days later, PONSONBY, DOCTOR JENNER and BROWN stand
     at the chamber-desk, talking over the Queen's itinerary.

                    BROWN
               (briskly)
          She'll be away on Friday between eight
          o'clock and six in the evening to
          visit the Grants in Glasalt.  If she's
          to make the journey there and back in
          the day she's to have no distractions
          the night before.  She'll take a light
          supper alone in her private drawing
          room and retire early.

                    PONSONBY
          She'll need to sign dispatches before
          she retires.

                    BROWN
          That can wait till the weekend.

                    PONSONBY
          There are important papers from --

                    BROWN
          It can wait.  Anything else?

                    JENNER
          Are you sure Her Majesty is up to such
          a long journey?  She has only just
          recovered from a severe head cold.

                    BROWN
          If I thought she wasn't up to it, I
          wouldn't let her go, would I?

     BROWN snaps together his papers and walks out, leaving
     PONSONBY and DOCTOR JENNER standing lamely at the table.

     EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY

     The next morning.  The ROYAL FAMILY are picnicking in the
     grounds.  VICTORIA walks along a path accompanied on one
     side by BROWN, on the other by BERTIE.

     BERTIE is in mid-plea.

                    BERTIE
          Surely it is for the gentlemen to
          decide when to stop...

                    VICTORIA
          It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It
          should be discouraged.

                    BERTIE
          Yes, but isn't midnight a little
          excessive?

                    VICTORIA
          It is quite late enough.

                    BERTIE
          But mama, the room was built expressly
          for that purpose.  It has been a
          smoking-room by tradition ever since
          father --

                    VICTORIA
               (cutting in angrily)
          Brown's responsibilities are onerous
          enough already.  He has far too much
          to do without having to stay up all
          night waiting for you to go to bed. 
          The smoking-room will be closed and
          the lights put out at twelve o'clock.

                    BERTIE
          Mama...

                    VICTORIA
          And that is my last word on the
          matter.

                    BERTIE
          Well, I'm sorry, but I really do think
          it's too much that the gentlemen of
          the house should be dictated to by a
          servant.

                    BROWN
          It's the Queen's decision.

                    BERTIE
          I beg your pardon?
               (to VICTORIA)
          Mama...?

     Before Bertie can continue, BROWN steps right into his
     face.

                    BROWN
          I think you should go now.
               (beat)
          You've tired your mother enough.

     BERTIE stares back, too stunned to speak.  He glances at
     his mother, but VICTORIA looks off into the distance as if
     she has not heard.  BERTIE turns and storms away.

     INT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY

     JOHN BROWN is standing in the doorway of a small cottage
     watching, with amused detachment, as a middle-aged couple,
     MR and MRS GRANT, race about their tiny living room, trying
     desperately to make it presentable for the Queen's sudden
     visit.  They fling open the windows, slosh water on the
     fire, tidy up their two grubby BOYS, plump up the cushions,
     dump knitting under the sofa and try to smarten themselves
     up, all in the space of a few seconds.

                    BROWN
          There's really no need for this.

                    MRS GRANT
          I'll not have her seeing it like it
          is!
               (beat)
          I know she means well, but I wish
          she'd warn us she was coming.

                    BROWN
          She thinks if she warned you, you'd go
          pouring water on the fire and stuffing
          the knitting under the sofa.

                    MR GRANT
          Aye, well, you can't stop a wife being
          house-proud.

     MRS GRANT surveys the room critically.

                    MRS GRANT
          All right.
               (beat)
          Show her in.

     EXT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY

     VICTORIA sits on a horse and trap.  BROWN steps out and
     helps her down.

                    BROWN
          They're ready now.

                    VICTORIA
          I hope they didn't go to any trouble,
          John.

                    BROWN
          Ah, well...

     INT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY

     VICTORIA steps in to be greeted by all four GRANTS in one
     military row, smoke still steaming off the fire.  BROWN
     stands behind her, barely able to contain himself.  But for
     VICTORIA, it is all she's ever known and so she takes it as
     perfectly normal.

                    VICTORIA
          Mr Grant.  How good it is to see you.

                    MR GRANT
               (bowing deeply)
          Your Majesty.

                    VICTORIA
          Mrs Grant.  How is your knee?  Has the
          pain eased a little?

                    MRS GRANT
               (bobbing in terror)
          Oh not so bad, ma'am.

                    VICTORIA
          Good.  Oh and here are Douglas and
          John.  Haven't you grown?

                    MRS GRANT
               (still bobbing away)
          Growing all the time, ma'am.

     MR GRANT remembers himself and gestures VICTORIA towards a
     chair.

                    MR GRANT
          Will you sit, ma'am?

     From his place by the wall, BROWN notices how easily she
     smiles as she is led to the chair.  She points to a picture
     on the wall and her good humour is infectious.

                    VICTORIA
          I know that!  That's Cairn Lochan.  We
          picnicked there once, did we not,
          John?

     INT. A SOCIETY PARTY, LONDON - DAY

     A few days later, a party of ARISTOCRATS, MINISTERS,
     DIPLOMATS, ESCORTS, BUSINESSMAN and WHORES.  Into this
     brouhaha come DISRAELI, his elderly wife MARY ANNE and the
     young STANLEY.  It is all eyes and nods here.  Everyone
     knows everyone.

                    DISRAELI
          Ah, the greasy pole.

                    MARY ANNE
          Don't be facetious, dear. Remember
          your position.

                    DISRAELI
          It's my position I'm thinking of.

     Across the room, STANLEY spots BERTIE amid a crowd of
     acolytes.

                    STANLEY
          I see the Prince of Wales is here.

                    DISRAELI
          I hope he got his mother's permission.

     STANLEY smiles faintly.  DISRAELI homes in on a punter and
     raises his hand, already working the room.

                    DISRAELI (CONT'D)
          Lord Salisbury!

     INT. A SOCIETY PARTY, LONDON - DAY

     The society party is hotting up.  STANLEY is deep in
     conversation with three SOCIETY LADIES.

                    SOCIETY LADY 1
               (ridiculously pleased with
                herself)
          Why is the Queen penny-wise and pound
          foolish?  Because she looks after the
          Browns and lets the sovereigns take
          care of themselves!

     A peal of naughty laughter.  Unseen, DISRAELI steps up.

                    DISRAELI
          And in your opinion?  Is she foolish?

     The SOCIETY LADY stares blankly back.

                    SOCIETY LADY 1
          Well I ... well, I mean to say, it's
          hardly right, is it?

                    DISRAELI
          What?

                    SOCIETY LADY 1
          Well, the Queen and --
               (appalled whisper)
          Mr Brown.

     DISRAELI stares at her steadily, already thinking ahead.

                    DISRAELI
          La superstition met le monde entier en
          flammes.

                    SOCIETY LADY 2
               (thick as shit)
          I beg your pardon?

                    DISRAELI
               (changing tack)
          Has anybody seen this ... Mr Brown?

                    STANLEY
          He is her personal servant, I believe.

                    SOCIETY LADY 1
               (knowingly)
          Follows her wherever she goes.

                    DISRAELI
          He would hardly make a very good
          personal assistant if he did not.

     INT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY

     BROWN stands by a wall, smiling to himself at the sight of
     QUEEN VICTORIA struggling to help lay the table while MRS
     GRANT nervously prattles on.

                    MRS GRANT
          ... it's not my best china.  I mean,
          it is my best china now, but the
          family set got stolen last summer.

                    VICTORIA
          Oh, I'm so sorry ...

                    MRS GRANT
          Of course it was no-one on the Estate. 
          More likely one of the lads from
          Braemar.  Or further even.
               (beat)
          I'll fetch the salt.

     MRS GRANT scurries away.  VICTORIA immediately holds up the
     spoons to BROWN with a questioning look -- above or beside
     the plate?  He nods her to the top and she quickly carries
     on.

     INT. A SOCIETY PARTY, LONDON - DAY

     DISRAELI and MARY ANNE stand with BERTIE and his ACOLYTES.

                    BERTIE
          Mr Disraeli.  Ma'am.

                    DISRAELI
          Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure
          to see you here.

                    BERTIE
          Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in
          sugar...?

                    DISRAELI
          I don't think I've had that pleasure.

     DISRAELI shakes hands with the fat sugar tycoon who wobbles
     with drink.  MARY ANNE engages him in conversation while
     BERTIE turns DISRAELI aside.

                    BERTIE
          No doubt you've heard the rumors.

                    DISRAELI
          I take no account of gossip, Your
          Highness.

                    BERTIE
          My concern is for the reputation of
          the Monarchy.

                    DISRAELI
          Of course.

                    BERTIE
          I fear the influence he has on her. 
          The man's word is not to be credited. 
          He is an arriviste of the very lowest
          water.
               (beat)
          She's having a bust cast of him.  In
          Nero Marquino marble.

                    DISRAELI
          I see.

                    BERTIE
          I would talk to her myself, but she
          won't listen to me.  She must be
          persuaded, by someone she respects, to
          abandon this ridiculous favoritism
          before a situation develops.

                    DISRAELI
          A situation?

                    BERTIE
          I don't imagine you frequent the
          Republican Clubs.  But the fact that
          neither you nor I are members should
          not blind us to the significance of
          their existence.
               (beat)
          The Tory Party has always been our
          party.

                    DISRAELI
          I'm flattered you think so.

                    BERTIE
          I tell you, if we don't stick together
          on this, you could find yourself First
          President's Opposition.
               (murdering it)
          Du Royaum Uni.

                    DISRAELI
          Quite.

     A beat.

                    BERTIE
          I don't think we can overstate the
          seriousness of this.

     DISRAELI nods and BERTIE walks swiftly back to his party. 
     The moment he's gone, STANLEY steps up to DISRAELI's side.

                    STANLEY
          What did he want?

                    DISRAELI
          To know when he'll be king.

     INT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY

     VICTORIA, BROWN and the GRANTS are eating around a large
     table.  Like a wife watching her husband, VICTORIA beams
     proudly at BROWN as he tells a story.

                    BROWN
          ... so Grant here and myself are
          riding over Lochnagar and the rain's
          pouring down in sheets and all we're
          thinking about is getting home for a
          drink, when through the gloom Grant
          spots a couple of poachers.  He gives
          me a shout and we chase them down
          towards the loch until Grant has your
          men up against the stacks and he's
          shouting and cursing at them, "Why are
          you poaching on Royal land?!"  And one
          of the little fellas looks up at him
          and says, "coz we've come up in the
          world."

     For a split second, both the GRANTS look petrified, then
     BROWN and VICTORIA explode into laughter and the GRANTS
     relax.  Suddenly the GRANTS are helpless with laughter too. 
     Beginning with VICTORIA's glass, BROWN pours out liberal
     quantities of whiskey all round.

     EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DUSK

     Later that night, the courtyard is packed with a gaggle of
     worried HOUSEHOLDERS holding lamps.

     Through the light, BROWN and VICTORIA clatter into the
     courtyard on the horse and trap.  DOCTOR JENNER breaks
     through the crowd in a state of high excitement.

                    JENNER
          Your Majesty!  Thank goodness you're
          safe!  I'll have a bath prepared
          immediately.  I recommend Macdonald's
          African Embrocation --

                    BROWN
               (cutting in)
          Ah, pipe down, man.  The woman's fine.

                    VICTORIA
          We stayed a little longer than
          expected with Mr and Mrs Grant.  It
          was most agreeable.

                    PONSONBY
          We were expecting you to return by
          six.

                    VICTORIA
          And now I am back.

     BROWN cannot resist one more little dig.

                    BROWN
          We took a nip of whiskey.

                    VICTORIA
          To keep out the cold.

                    BROWN
          Aye.

     VICTORIA smiles and BROWN lifts her off the trap.  Before
     walking in she turns and, in front of everyone, says...

                    VICTORIA
          Thank you, John.

     BROWN bows and the QUEEN walks on.  As she straightens up,
     he finds PONSONBY and DOCTOR JENNER staring back at him in
     utter disbelief at what she has just said.  He turns and
     leads the horse back to the stables.

                    JENNER
               (under his breath)
          She's drunk.

     PONSONBY doesn't answer.  He is watching BROWN very
     closely.

                    JENNER (CONT'D)
          A distinct flushing around the cheeks. 
          She was drunk, I tell you.

                    PONSONBY
          No, she wasn't.

     Silence.  JENNER turns to look at PONSONBY.

                    JENNER
          Surely not ...

     PONSONBY's face is set hard.

                    PONSONBY
          Don't even think about it.

     INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, BALLROOM - NIGHT

     A crush of kilted GHILLIES as we slam into the height of
     the annual Ghillie's Ball.

     The whole court is reeling through the dance; all of them
     beholding the extraordinary spectacle of QUEEN VICTORIA and
     JOHN BROWN dancing together in the middle of the hall.

     PONSONBY and JENNER stand by the wall, watching.  Close-up
     on PONSONBY'S face as JENNER mutters darkly.

                    JENNER
          Pandora's Box ...

     With a slam of feet the reel ends, the GHILLIES roar and
     BROWN and VICTORIA stand smiling at each other in silence. 
     A King and his Queen.

     INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, BALLROOM - NIGHT

     Later that night.

     We find BROWN, slouched on the ground, dead-drunk and
     snoring loudly.

     EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

     A few days later, four JOURNALISTS are scrabbling up a
     stony path, armed with telescopes.

     EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

     A large ROYAL PARTY is making its way smoothly and quietly
     up the mountain.  BROWN is on horseback, leading VICTORIA
     on a dapple-grey.

     EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

     The JOURNALISTS rattle up the hill.

     EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

     BROWN and VICTORIA start pulling ahead of the main party.

     EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

     The JOURNALISTS scramble up to some gorse bushes, dump
     themselves down and start setting up the telescopes.

     EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

     BROWN and VICTORIA near the summit when BROWN suddenly
     stops.  He stiffens and turns to face the wind, as if
     catching a scent.  VICTORIA frowns.

                    VICTORIA
          What is it, John?
               (beat)
          John?

                    BROWN
          I heard something.

     BROWN's eyes fix on some distant gorse bushes.

                    BROWN (CONT'D)
          I won't be long.

     He dismounts and races off.

     EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

     The JOURNALISTS are peering through their telescopes.

                    JOURNALIST 1
          Where did he get to?  I've lost him?

     Below them, BROWN races across the riverbank and
     undergrowth, unseen.

                    JOURNALIST 2
          I don't know if there's much worth
          writing about.

                    JOURNALIST 1
          Hard to tell.

     BROWN rears up above them and stops.

                    BROWN
          This close enough for you?  Go on!  On
          your way!  You filthy scavengers!

     The JOURNALISTS scramble to their feet and start legging it
     down the hill, while BROWN roars furiously, hurling their
     bags after them.

                    BROWN (CONT'D)
          You leave her alone, do you hear?!

     The JOURNALISTS vanish below the hillside.

     INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, UPPER SERVANT'S TABLE - NIGHT

     That night.

     BROWN is standing at the head of the table, yelling at the
     UPPER SERVANTS, irrespective of ARCHIE or anyone.

                    BROWN
          If I catch the miserable by-blow who
          told those men where she'd be, then
          I'll hang his balls to dry on Jock
          Wemyss, so I will!!

     ARCHIE glances up at BERTIE'S VALET.  He is staring down at
     the table, teeth gritted, fists clenched.  BROWN rounds on
     them all again.

                    BROWN (CONT'D)
          What happens to John Brown is his
          business, but the Queen's security
          will never be compromised!

                    BERTIE'S VALET
          We --

                    BROWN
          You'll talk when I'm finished!

     BERTIE'S VALET stares at him in astonishment.  BROWN turns
     back to the table.

                    BROWN (CONT'D)
          That kind of disloyalty will not be
          tolerated in this house, is that
          clear?
               (beat, yelling)
          I said, is that clear?!

     There is a general mutter of assent.  BROWN turns and
     storms out as ARCHIE gets up to follow.

     INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, HENRY PONSONBY'S ROOMS - DAY

     A few days later, PONSONBY is sitting at his desk, hands to
     his hips, listening quietly as DOCTOR JENNER reads from his
     copy of Punch.

                    JENNER
          "Court Circular, Balmoral."
               (beat)
          "On Tuesday, Mr John Brown enjoyed a
          display of sheep-dipping by local
          farmers.  On Wednesday, he attended a
          seance where he was pleased to listen
          to a recital of Auld Lang Syne by Mr
          Robert Burns himself ..."

     INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, LOWER CORRIDOR - DAY

     BROWN crashes through a door holding a copy of the same
     journal.

                    JENNER (O.S.)
          "... On Thursday, Mr John Brown walked
          on the slopes, accompanied by family
          and friend ..."

     INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, CORRIDOR - DAY

     BROWN storms up to PONSONBY's door.

                    JENNER (O.S.)
          Mr Brown retired early.

     INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, HENRY PONSONBY'S ROOMS - DAY

     BROWN bursts in on PONSONBY and JENNER, slamming down his
     copy of Punch on the desk.  He is furious but controlled.

                    BROWN
          If I find out that you had anything to
          do with this, I will have you sacked.

                    PONSONBY
          I believe that decision rests with Her
          Majesty.

                    BROWN
          Don't think I can't persuade her.

                    PONSONBY
          I don't doubt that the Queen was
          highly amused.  She has always had a
          very healthy sense of humor.

                    BROWN
          This is a slur on her good name.

                    PONSONBY
          In as much as the article is about
          yourself, I think you must now accept
          that the public has a right to its
          interest in you.

                    BROWN
          Nobody has any rights over me.

                    PONSONBY
          We are all of us subject to forces
          beyond our control, Mr Brown, even
          you.

     BROWN stares at him in silence.  A beat.

                    BROWN
          You'll regret saying that.

     INT. THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT - DAY

     Chaos.  The Tories are losing the vote as both sides of the
     house stand and shout at each other while the SPEAKER rises
     in his chair.

                    SPEAKER (O.S.)
          Order!  Order!  ORDER!

     A buzzing silence settles as the house sits for the vote. 
     The COUNTERS approach the chair.

                    SPEAKER (CONT'D)
          Result of the vote to the first
          reading of the Bill to Disestablish
          the Irish Church.

     A murmur of excitement from the LIBERALS.

                    SPEAKER (CONT'D)
          Order!

     A beat.

                    COUNTER
          Ayes to the right, three hundred and
          thirty, noes to the left, two hundred
          and sixty-five...

     By the time he reaches "sixty-five" his voice is drowned in
     cheers from the Liberal benches.  DISRAELI and the rest of
     the front bench sit in stony silence.

     Somewhere on the Liberal back benches, a wild-eyed
     maverick, DILKE, rises to his feet shouting:

                    DILKE
          Mr Speaker, I table a motion in
          furtherance of the Bill to
          Disestablish the Monarchy!

     A roar from the irate TORIES and chaos reigns again.

                    SPEAKER
          Order!  Order!!  ORDER!!!

     INT. THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT, LOBBY CORRIDOR - NIGHT

     An hour later the house is empty except for a few
     straggling MPs hurrying home.  An exhausted DISRAELI stands
     in the corridor with STANLEY.

                    DISRAELI
          We're going to lose.

                    STANLEY
          You can't know that for sure.

                    DISRAELI
          Gladstone's got his party facing the
          same way for the first time in years. 
          We need help.
               (long beat)
          Where is the old girl?

                    STANLEY
          Who?

                    DISRAELI
          Mrs Brown.

                    STANLEY
          It's questionable whether there's any
          advantage to be had from that
          direction.  She's never been less
          popular.

                    DISRAELI
          In the press, perhaps.
               (holding up Punch)
          But she's sold more copies of her
          Highland Journal in three months than
          Punch will ever sell in a year.  Time
          to wheel her out.

                    STANLEY
          She's refusing to leave Balmoral.

                    DISRAELI
          What's her excuse this time?

                    STANLEY
          The Princess Louisa is too ill to
          move.  Frankly, the Queen's rather
          upset at the recent spate of bad
          publicity.
               (beat)
          You're smiling.

                    DISRAELI
          I was trying to imagine "rather
          upset."

     The elderly prelate, DEAN WELLSELLY, hurries in through the
     lobby doors.  DISRAELI puts on a welcoming smile.

                    DEAN WELLSELLY
          Forgive me, gentlemen.  I'm late.

                    DISRAELI
          Not at all, Dean.  Good of you to
          spare the time.

                    DEAN WELLSELLY
          I came as quickly as I could.

                    DISRAELI
          You've seen the latest cartoon in
          Punch, I take it?

                    DEAN WELLSELLY
               (completely lost)
          I beg your pardon?

     DISRAELI opens the copy of Punch and hands it to Dean
     Wellselly.  The Dean clears his throat and starts to read.

                    DISRAELI
               (as Wellselly reads)
          One of our madder brethren in the
          house was calling for disestablishment
          of the monarchy.

     Dean Wellselly looks up from the article, horrified.

                    DEAN WELLSELLY
          Good Lord.

                    STANLEY
               (playing the soft glove)
          I'm sure it won't come to that.

                    DISRAELI
               (the hard glove)
          No.  But it has now become a matter
          for our consciences.
               (beat)
          I was just telling Stanley how vital
          it is that the nation should feel the
          visible influence of the Sovereign. 
          As a reminder that Parliament, indeed
          my own ministry, depends on the will
          of the Queen.

     DEAN WELLSELLY nods his head gravely.  Over his shoulder,
     STANLEY is gaping at DISRAELI's silky distortion of the
     party political maneuver into a moral imperative.

                    DEAN WELLSELLY
          I couldn't agree with you more, but I
          am only Dean of Windsor.  I don't
          understand what ...

     DISRAELI interrupts.

                    DISRAELI
          We hear from Balmoral that Mr Brown is
          interesting Her Majesty in some of the
          forms of worship associated with ...
          low-church Presbyterian.

     Silence.  DEAN WELLSELLY'S face is a picture of
     unrestrained horror.  Low-church.  Presbyterian.

                    DEAN WELLSELLY
          What can we do?

                    DISRAELI
          Oh, several things.

     INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, QUEEN'S DRAWING ROOM - DAY

     Some days later.

     Queen VICTORIA sits at her desk while Henry PONSONBY stands
     in front of her, holding a copy of The Times.

                    VICTORIA
          Read it.

                    PONSONBY
          Again?

                    VICTORIA
          Read it!

     PONSONBY coughs once and begins again.

                    PONSONBY
          "The Times wishes to join the rest of
          Her Majesty's loyal subjects in
          expressing its deep joy at the news
          that the Queen is soon to come out of
          her mourning."

     VICTORIA glowers at him.

                    VICTORIA
          Who told them that?

                    PONSONBY
          I have no idea.

                    VICTORIA
          Why not?

                    PONSONBY
          I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser
          than yourself.

     Suddenly, VICTORIA's temper goes and she shouts at him.

                    VICTORIA
          No-one should think themselves wiser
          than me!
               (beat)
          It is not for any of the Queen's
          subjects to presume to tell Her
          Majesty when and where She should come
          out of mourning.  It is the Queen's
          sorrow that keeps her secluded!  It is
          Her overwhelming amount of work and
          responsibility, work which She feels
          will soon wear her out entirely!

                    PONSONBY
          Your Majesty --

                    VICTORIA
               (cutting right through him)
          Is it not enough that She is uncheered
          and unguided that she should also have
          to suffer these malicious rumors?!
               (a pause, more quietly)
          I am not a fool.
               (beat)
          I know there are those in the
          establishment too afraid to attack me
          and so they attack my dearest friends. 
          Sometimes -- I feel that Brown is all
          I have left of Albert.
               (beat)
          And now they attack Brown too.

     She looks up, eyes blazing.

                    VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          I will not give him up to them.

     INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, ROOM ADJOINING DRAWING ROOM - DAY

     BROWN is guarding the door to the drawing room while the
     balding BERTIE muscles up, eye ball to eye ball.

                    BERTIE
          I wish to see my mother.

                    BROWN
          She's busy.

                    BERTIE
          Convey her a message.

                    BROWN
          She's away to Windsor tomorrow.  Talk
          to her there.

                    BERTIE
          Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to
          speak with her urgently about matters
          concerning the press.

                    BROWN
          Are you deaf as well as stupid?

     A split-second.  BERTIE gapes at him.

                    BERTIE
          What did you say?

                    BROWN
          I said, are you deaf as well as
          stupid?

                    BERTIE
          Do you know who you address, sir?

                    BROWN
          Whom you address.

                    BERTIE
          The future King!

     A beat.

                    BROWN
          Well, everyone's entitled to their
          opinion.

                    BERTIE
          Out of my way!

     Foolishly, BERTIE tries to barge his way past.  Suddenly
     BROWN loses it completely.  He grabs the Prince of Wales by
     the shoulders and pins him back, shouting right into his
     face.

                    BROWN
          LEAVE US ALONE, WHY DON'T YOU!!

     For a split-second, BROWN's eyes flicker as he senses he
     has gone too far.  A look of pure venom in BERTIE'S face,
     then ...

     EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUADRANGLE - NIGHT

     Weeks later.

     In a roar of hooves and wheels, the Royal Carriage sweeps
     into the huge quadrangle.  JOHN BROWN stands rigid on the
     box, glowering at all the world.

     CAPTION: "WINDSOR"

     INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, SERVANT'S CORRIDOR - NIGHT

     A pair of doors open out onto a torchlit driveway as a mass
     of SERVANTS rush in and out, ferrying bags an trunks.

     BROWN marches in, still charged-up from the strain of the
     journey's watchfulness.  He spots an UNDER-PORTER snatching
     a break.

                    BROWN
          You!  What's your business here?!

                    UNDER-PORTER
               (jumping to)
          Under-porter, sir.

                    BROWN
          Well, don't stand where you shouldn't!

     The UNDER-PORTER scrambles up the stairs.  A few SERVANTS
     exchange looks.  BROWN seems more determined than ever to
     exert his control.

     EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, STABLES - NIGHT

     That night.

     Carrying an old storm lamp high over his head, BROWN walks
     towards the stables.

     EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE - DAY

     The next day.

     BROWN is on horseback, riding with VICTORIA through the
     grounds.  He is still jumpy, eyes flicking left and right,
     searching for intruders.  They are being followed at a
     distance by two EQUERRIES on horseback.  VICTORIA frowns
     peevishly.

                    VICTORIA
          Must they always follow us?

                    BROWN
          I ordered it.  It's for your own
          safety.

                    VICTORIA
          Dear me, you'll be telling me to watch
          what I eat next.

     BROWN doesn't react.  A beat.

                    VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          Am I not safe enough with you, John?

                    BROWN
          Aye.
               (looking away)
          But there are Fenians reported on the
          mainland.

                    VICTORIA
               (tutting irritably)
          The threat from the Irish is greatly
          exaggerated, I'm sure.

                    BROWN
               (snapping back)
          I'll decide when it's exaggerated.

     BROWN chucks his horse on, bringing a firm halt to the
     conversation.  A beat.  He pulls up suddenly, staring at
     the shadows in the copse.

                    VICTORIA
          Is anything the matter, John?
               (beat)
          John?

     He stares for along moment and then lets it go.

                    BROWN
          Nothing's the matter.

     INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, STABLES - NIGHT

     BROWN marches down the line of horse boxes.  A stable-lad,
     BARNEY, is feeding the horses.  He looks twitchy.

                    BROWN
          Hey, Barney.

                    BARNEY
          Mr Brown, sir --

                    BROWN
          It's cold out there tonight, Barney.

     Reaching his pony, BROWN stops and smiles.  The animal
     lifts its face to him and he softly strokes his muzzle.

                    BROWN (CONT'D)
          Yeah, there's a good girl.
               (to Barney)
          Have you had a look at this hoof?  She
          was limping badly.  I think there
          might be a stone in it.

                    BARNEY
          Yeah, yeah, I did.

                    BROWN
          Good man.  And is she all right?

                    BARNEY
          Yeah.

                    BROWN
          Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? 
          Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you
          know the Queen's riding tomorrow?

                    BARNEY
          Yeah.

                    BROWN
               (beat)
          Are you all right, Barney?

     BARNEY twitches again and BROWN realizes too late.  The
     split-second he turns, he sees THREE MEN.

                    BROWN (CONT'D)
          Oh, aye...

     The MEN pile onto him and he collapses under their weight.

     As he falls, BROWN manages to yank himself round, bang up a
     fist and fling the others off him.  But the FIRST MAN is up
     again, twisting an arm round his neck and tugging him back. 
     The others grapple his arms down, but BROWN is incredibly
     strong.  Even now, grunting and scrabbling, he makes them
     fight to force him back.  BARNEY stands transfixed in
     horror.

     Dumping BROWN against the wall, the men step back and start
     kicking the shit out of him.  BROWN curls into a ball, jaw
     locked, hands over his head.  Not a sound.

     Finally, they back off, panting hard.  The FIRST MAN pulls
     out a bottle of whiskey, yanks back BROWN's head and forces
     whiskey down his throat.  It spills over his face and
     dribbles down his neck.

     INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUEEN'S SITTING ROOM - DAY

     The next day.

     VICTORIA is standing at the windows.  The door opens and
     LADY ELY walks in.

                    VICTORIA
          Well?

                    LADY ELY
          Mr Brown is unable to attend today.

                    VICTORIA
          Why?

                    LADY ELY
          I believe he is unwell, ma'am.

                    VICTORIA
          Unwell?

                    LADY ELY
          I understand he was in a fight.

                    VICTORIA
          Has he been hurt?

                    LADY ELY
          I believe not, ma'am.  I understand --
          he'd had rather too much to drink.

     VICTORIA walks away and steps behind her desk.

                    VICTORIA
          You may go.

     LADY ELY bows and walks out.  VICTORIA stares at the desk a
     moment, then picks up her pen and tries to work.  She
     cannot.

     INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - DAY

     BROWN sits on the edge of the bed in only his
     undergarments.  His face, arms, legs and fingers are livid
     with bruises, but he sits there, stiff-backed and gritting
     his teeth, while ARCHIE crouches in front of him, tending
     to his wounds.

                    BROWN
          And she sent no word down?

                    ARCHIE
          They said you were drunk.
               (beat)
          Why don't you tell her the truth?

                    BROWN
          She'll think it's her fault for
          keeping me.

     ARCHIE completes one of the dressings when BROWN suddenly
     reaches back and starts trying to put on his shirt.

                    ARCHIE
          What are you doing?!

                    BROWN
          I'm getting dressed.

                    ARCHIE
          You've got three broken ribs, man!

                    BROWN
          I've got my duties to attend to.

                    ARCHIE
          Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit
          state to go anywhere.

                    BROWN
          She'll be worried about me.

                    ARCHIE
          She'll get over it.

                    BROWN
          I can't let her down now, Archie.

                    ARCHIE
          And when was the last time she put
          herself out for you?  Look, John,
          whatever she says to you now, in the
          end you're still a servant.

                    BROWN
          Oh, I'm much more than that.

                    ARCHIE
          Aye, she may say that to you, but the
          woman can say what she wants.

                    BROWN
          You watch your tongue.

                    ARCHIE
          Come on, man, I'm telling you what you
          already know.

                    BROWN
          You know nothing about her!

                    ARCHIE
          When are you gonna see it, John?  She
          doesn't give a damn about you.

     BROWN lunges for the bedside drawer and pulls out a card
     showing a coy picture of a pretty woman.  He holds it up,
     eyes blazing.

                    BROWN
          From the Queen!

     He reads out the inscription.

                    BROWN (CONT'D)
          My lips may give a message better of
          Christmas love than e'en this letter.
               (beat)
          To my best friend, J.B. from his best
          friend, V.R.
               (he thrusts it in his
                brother's face)
          Best friend!

                    ARCHIE
          Aye.

                    BROWN
          She means it.

     ARCHIE stares at him.

                    ARCHIE
          She'll drop you.  When she's done with
          you, she'll drop you.

                    BROWN
          Get out.
               (beat)
          Out!

     ARCHIE steps back but BROWN roars at him.

                    BROWN (CONT'D)
          OUT!!

     ARCHIE steps outside and BROWN is left alone.

     INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUEEN'S SITTING ROOM - DAY

     The next day.  VICTORIA sits at her desk.  PONSONBY hands
     her letters to sign.

                    PONSONBY
          ... to be followed by a visit from
          Lady Bridport.  She is keen to secure
          a place for her niece as Maid of
          Honor.

     VICTORIA signs the last letter and sits back.

                    VICTORIA
          I am tired.

     PONSONBY coughs.

                    PONSONBY
          There is one other matter.

                    VICTORIA
          What is it?

                    PONSONBY
          I have a letter, ma'am.

                    VICTORIA
          From whom?

                    PONSONBY
          From Princess Helena and other members
          of your family.

                    VICTORIA
               (stiffening defensively)
          My family is quite capable of
          communicating with the Queen in
          person.

     PONSONBY does not reply.  Finally, VICTORIA is obliged to
     ask.

                    VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          What do they want?

                    PONSONBY
          They are demanding the dismissal of
          John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.

     VICTORIA stares through the window, expressionless.

     INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CHAPEL - DAY

     VICTORIA walks through the ornate chapel, nervously
     fingering her handkerchief.  Waiting for her, smiling
     softly, is the Dean of Windsor, DEAN WELLSELLY.

                    DEAN WELLSELLY
          You wished to see me, ma'am?

     She holds his eyes for a moment, then nods.

     INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CHAPEL - DAY

     A few minutes later, VICTORIA and DEAN WELLSELLY are seated
     in a corner of the chapel, talking softly.  She cannot
     bring herself to look at him and so does not notice how
     carefully he is watching her throughout the interview. 
     This is incredibly hard for her to say, but she struggles
     to be as honest as possible.

                    VICTORIA
          My husband tried always to make me
          think more subtly.  Of course he
          taught me so much and I can never
          repay my debt to him, or the love I
          feel, even now.  But, in truth, I
          think I am someone who can only feel
          things while they are alive to me. 
          For that reason, I know I do not have
          a subtle mind.  I know that.  But I
          work hard and I try to do my duty.
               (she hesitates; she is
                struggling now)
          However, I have noticed of late that
          my feelings of grief are not so strong
          and -- that I find myself leaning more
          upon the comfort of living friends.
               (beat)
          Friends close to me now.

     She stops herself.  She is crying.  DEAN WELLSELLY watches
     her a moment, then speaks close, choosing his words
     carefully.

                    DEAN WELLSELLY
          Your Majesty, a settled resignation is
          more lasting proof of affection than
          active grief.  If the good Lord sees
          fit to bring one into contact with
          congenial fellow beings, one should
          not analyze one's reaction too deeply. 
          To allow oneself to be comforted by
          someone else need not imply any
          disloyalty to the memory of the loved
          one.

     Silence.  VICTORIA stares into the long, dark chapel. 
     Gradually, as she takes in the tone of his remarks, her
     disappointment turns to anger.

     INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUEEN'S SITTING ROOM - DAY

     The next day, VICTORIA stands at the far window and her
     back to the room.  Lined up against the wall are BERTIE and
     his siblings.

                    VICTORIA
          Sir Henry.

     PONSONBY steps forward.

                    PONSONBY
          Ma'am?

                    VICTORIA
          Please tell the Princess, and other
          signatories to this letter, that the
          Queen will not be dictated to, or made
          to alter, in any way, what she has
          found to answer for her comfort.
               (beat)
          Do I make myself clear?

                    PONSONBY
          Ma'am.

     A beat.

                    VICTORIA
          You may go.

     They all file out.

     EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE - DAY

     A few days later.

     BROWN and VICTORIA are riding on horseback.  Although
     better than he was, BROWN'S face is still badly bruised. 
     They turn a corner banked by trees.  BROWN is watching the
     QUEEN closely.  She stops.

                    VICTORIA
          I would like to get down.

     Without a word, BROWN dismounts and helps her off her
     horse.

                    VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          John?

                    BROWN
          Yes, ma'am?

                    VICTORIA
          I was told you were in a fight.

                    BROWN
          Yes, ma'am.

                    VICTORIA
          Has someone seen to those bruises?

                    BROWN
          Yes, ma'am.

     A beat.

                    BROWN (CONT'D)
          Ma'am?

                    VICTORIA
          Yes?

                    BROWN
          Having considered my position here at
          court, I have come to the conclusion
          that it is in the best interest of
          Your Majesty that I should resign.

                    VICTORIA
          I do not accept.

     A beat.

                    BROWN
          I had foreseen that you would not. 
          But Your Majesty should understand --
          that my mind will not be changed in
          this.  I leave for Deeside --

                    VICTORIA
               (cutting in)
          The Queen forbids it.
               (beat)
          I cannot allow it because I cannot
          live without you.  Without you, I
          cannot find the strength to be who I
          must be.  Please.

     She takes his hand to her mouth and kisses it gently, then
     looks at him, utterly helpless.

                    VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          Promise me you won't let them send me
          back.

     A long silence.  BROWN holds her hand tight.

                    BROWN
          I promise.

                              FADE TO BLACK.

     CAPTION: "1868"

                              FADE IN:

     EXT. LOWLANDS - DAY

     A few weeks later.

     A tiny horse-drawn carriage creeps across a huge Highland
     landscape.

                    DISRAELI (V.O.)
          Yesterday, Gladstone talked for three
          hours on the Irish Church Bill ... I
          am as guilty as the rest of
          underestimating his reforming zeal.
          Tory days may be numbered, but I fancy
          there yet remains one last hope of
          deliverance.  Wheresoever the blame
          lies, we must now close ranks and
          defend Mrs Brown's England.  As for my
          interminable journey to the land of
          Calvin, oatcakes and sulphur ...

     EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY

     DISRAELI hurries through the pouring rain.

                    DISRAELI (O.S.)
          ... no Prime Minister made greater
          sacrifice than attempting to run the
          country six hundred miles north of
          civilization.

     Reaching the castle, he hurries inside and the great doors
     bang behind him.

     INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, QUEEN'S DRAWING ROOM - DAY

     The next day.

     QUEEN VICTORIA is playing the piano like she walks, with
     great vim and vigor.  The tune is some quaint Scottish
     ballad which she belts out in her clear strong voice,
     almost drowning out PRINCE ARTHUR, PRINCE LOUISE and PRINCE
     LEOPOLD who are meant to be accompanying her.  They stand
     in a nervous semi-circle, fumbling their harmonies. 
     Ignoring them completely, VICTORIA bobs up her head with a
     quizzical smile to make sure she is being appreciated.

     DISRAELI and the rest of the HOUSEHOLD stand a few yards
     off, smiling rigidly.  DISRAELI, the consummate politician
     to his inch-high insteps, out-smiles the lot of them.  This
     man is in raptures of delight.  And the more liquid his
     smiles, the happier he makes VICTORIA.  He beams, she
     belts, until her children are drowned out completely.

     And then, with characteristic suddenness, VICTORIA stops
     playing and launches into one of her tirades.  The
     HOUSEHOLD wobbles in shock like children on a switch-back,
     but DISRAELI glides smoothly from delight to sober concern.

                    VICTORIA
          How dare the Irish break with the
          Anglicans? 
          If Albert were alive today he would
          never allow the Crown to give up
          Church patronage.  No, the Irish must
          be told, very firmly, to stay exactly
          where they are.  It is the thin edge
          of the wedge, Mr Disraeli.  Next, you
          will be telling me that the Crown no
          longer governs this nation.

     A beat. A nervous silence in the Household.

                    DISRAELI
          Your Majesty remains at the very
          epicenter of governance.  As for your
          people, look no further than the sales
          of your Highland Journals to see in
          what affection the nation holds their
          Queen.
               (beat)
          You sell even more copies than Mr
          Dickens.

                    VICTORIA
          But I lack your prose, Mr Disraeli.

     VICTORIA gives him a tiny smile.  DISRAELI acknowledges it,
     then steers the conversation back.

                    DISRAELI
          Of course I understand your concern. 
          You miss your people.
               (a pause)
          And they miss you.

     VICTORIA registers a slight flicker of defensiveness at the
     implied criticism.

                    VICTORIA
          Then they may read about me.

                    DISRAELI
          Indeed, and for that they are
          eternally grateful.

                    VICTORIA
          Is that not enough?

                    DISRAELI
          In so many ways ... and yet it is your
          presence they crave.  A figurehead.

     VICTORIA has the measure of him.

                    VICTORIA
          I never thought to be bullied by you,
          Mr Disraeli.  You, I thought,
          understood a widow's grief.

                    DISRAELI
          Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for
          the nation, only for myself.  As Prime
          Minister I confess I miss your
          presence, but that is only an
          expression of my own selfish desires
          and I should not burden you with it.

     The Household waits.  Has he clawed himself back?  VICTORIA
     acknowledges his apology.  Her voice drops and she talks
     directly to DISRAELI, straight from the heart.

                    VICTORIA
          I stay here because I am happy.
               (beat)
          Is that such a terrible crime?

                    DISRAELI
          No, ma'am.

     At this moment the far door opens and BROWN walks in.

                    BROWN
          Time for your walk.

     Without a word, VICTORIA rises from her chair and starts
     following him out.  As they pass DISRAELI, she stops.

                    VICTORIA
          This is my good John Brown.

                    DISRAELI
               (taking him in)
          Yes.

                    VICTORIA
          I have asked him to show you a little
          of Highland life while you are with us
          at Balmoral.

     BROWN measures DISRAELI suspiciously.

                    BROWN
          What brings you here?

                    DISRAELI
          A man can refuse only so many
          invitations from his Queen.  It was
          remiss of me not to come earlier.

     VICTORIA smiles.  BROWN stares.

                    BROWN
          What do you know about the Highlands?

                    DISRAELI
          I am a blank sheet.

                    BROWN
          Do you hunt?

                    DISRAELI
          Occasionally.

                    BROWN
          Dare say you can be taught.

                    DISRAELI
          To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.

                    BROWN
          If you hunt, you kill.

     DISRAELI counters effortlessly.

                    DISRAELI
          Well then, I'll do my best.

     EXT. HIGHLANDS, GLEN GELDER - DAY

     Staying close to the ground we develop through a series of
     shots showing the other highlands -- sheet rain against
     heather and gorse, rivulets of water slashing through mud,
     crude pathways sliding in wind and all ball-breakingly
     cold.

     Coming up the hill, we begin to make out a hunting party. 
     The sound first.  Like a small army, crashing their way up
     the winding path.  GHILLIES urging on their horses and
     dogs, guns and equipment jangling off pony-hacks an then
     the tall figure of JOHN BROWN striding out in front.

     Making no concession to anyone, he force-marches them up
     the hill, eyes on the hunt ahead. Behind them trot the men
     on horseback -- DISRAELI, PONSONBY, BERTIE and other
     GENTLEMEN, each led by GHILLIES and ATTENDANTS, among them
     ARCHIE.

     Suddenly, BROWN stops and raises a hand.  The party halts.

     He listens for a second.  Satisfied that he has found his
     quarry, he brings his hand down and the party of gentlemen
     dismount as quietly as they can.

     As he waits, BROWN winces slightly from the pain in his
     side.  He pulls a flask of whiskey from his sporran and
     drinks.  All the time, DISRAELI keeps his eyes on BROWN.

     EXT. HIGHLANDS, GLEN GELDER - DAY

     The stalking.

     Everyone is now fanned out along the hillside, a ghillie to
     each gentleman, slowly and silently moving up the hill.

     DISRAELI stalks with BROWN, panting hard to keep up, eyes
     on his man, trying to make no sound.

     Suddenly, BROWN stops.  Very slowly he rises.  DISRAELI
     rides alongside and sees ...

     A huge stag staring majestically across the hillside.

     Keeping his movements smooth and slow, BROWN brings up his
     rifle, cocks it and offers DISRAELI the kill.  With a
     deferential gesture of the hands, DISRAELI declines.  BROWN
     stares at him a split-second, raises the rifle to his
     shoulder and fires.

     EXT. HIGHLANDS, GLEN GELDER - DAY

     The kill.

     A rapid montage of guns firing, as we cut to ...

     INT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY

     BROWN sweeps in from the hunt, DISRAELI dripping at his
     side.

                    BROWN
               (demonstrating with his
                rifle)
          Always remember, you keep it tight to
          your shoulder, you absorb the kick. 
          Aim for the head.  Then imagine it's
          Gladstone.

                    DISRAELI
               (smiling)
          Quite.

     BROWN pulls out his flask and offers some to DISRAELI, who
     declines.  He watches BROWN take a long swig.

     INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, UPPER SERVANT'S TABLE - NIGHT

     That night.

     BROWN is standing at his place, drinking steadily.  He has
     a sheet of paper and a pen and is ticking off a list. 
     Lined up in front of him, trying desperately not to laugh,
     are five or six UPPER SERVANTS including the pretty
     ASSISTANT DRESSER and BERTIE'S VALET.  They each step up,
     one at a time, to make their report.

                    BROWN
               (ticking as he goes)
          ... Back doors, West Wing.

                    UPPER SERVANT 1
          Checked and locked, sir.

                    BROWN
          Side doors, East Wing.

                    ASSISTANT DRESSER
          Checked and locked, sir.

                    BROWN
          Louder, girl!

                    ASSISTANT DRESSER
               (creasing up)
          Checked and locked, sir.

                    BROWN
          Kitchen and lower house.

                    BERTIE'S VALET
          Checked and locked, sir.

                    BROWN
          Back and upper corridors.

                    UPPER SERVANT 2
          Checked and locked, sir.

                    BROWN
          Front door.
               (beat)
          Checked and locked.

     Folding up the paper, BROWN downs his glass of whiskey and
     sits.  On his nod, dinner is served by UNDER SERVANTS amid
     a clatter of cutlery and chat.

     ARCHIE looks across at his brother but BROWN is hunched
     over his plate, pecking at his food.

     Someone titters and ARCHIE looks up.  BERTIE'S VALET
     coughs.  BROWN slowly lifts his head.  His eyes have the
     slightly unfocused look of too much drink.  It is clear to
     ARCHIE that he is about to be sent-up.

                    BERTIE'S VALET
               (with a smug smile)
          Did you see any Irish assassins today,
          Mr Brown?

     Brown doesn't react.

                    BERTIE'S VALET (CONT'D)
          We heard the dogs were Fenian
          sympathizers.

     Brown drinks.

                    BERTIE'S VALET (CONT'D)
          Or was it the stag ...?

     Everyone bursts out laughing.  Brown slams down his glass.

                    BROWN
          There's not a soul here cares about
          that wee woman's safety except me! 
          She'd die in a ditch if I wasn't there
          to look out for her --

     He stops.  ARCHIE has come across to his brother's chair
     and pulls gently on his arm.

     BROWN stares at the SERVANTS.  Everyone is about to burst
     out laughing.  Keeping his dignity, he pushes back his
     chair and lets ARCHIE lead him away.

     As BROWN reaches the double doors, the laughter hits him in
     the back like a wave. ARCHIE holds him steady.

     INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

     BROWN is lying on a grubby bed.  ARCHIE is looking around
     the untidy room.  For the first time, he notices a thick
     manuscript on the table.  BROWN follows his eyes.

                    ARCHIE
          What's this?

                    BROWN
          It's a diary.

                    ARCHIE
          Be careful who sees it.

                    BROWN
          What do you take me for?

     ARCHIE turns back to BROWN.

                    ARCHIE
          You should have someone look after
          you.

                    BROWN
          I'm all right.  I just need to rest up
          a wee bit.
               (feeling everything spin)
          The room ... You don't have to stay.

     BROWN shuts his eyes and starts to drift.  ARCHIE watches
     over him.

                    ARCHIE
          The place is a mess.

                    BROWN
          I can't move to tidy.

                    ARCHIE
          It's what the maids are for.

                    BROWN
          I'm not having some prattler going
          through my things.

     A beat.

                    ARCHIE
          Won't you give yourself a rest, John? 
          She's other people to look out for
          her.

                    BROWN
          She needs me, Archie.  She canna do
          without me, she said it to my face.
               (his hands come up to cover
                his eyes)
          How can I stop now?

     INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, SERVANT'S CORRIDOR - DAY

     Dawn the next morning.

     BROWN is scrambling into his jacket as he hurries down the
     stairs.

     EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY

     BROWN crashes out of a side-door -- just fully dressed --
     to be met by the smiling figure of DISRAELI.  He is got up
     in smart walking boots, plus-fours and a tweed jacket.

                    BROWN
          You sent for me.

                    DISRAELI
          I've been called back to London.  My
          last day.  I thought I might take a
          walk on Lochnagar.

     BROWN stares straight back.

     EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

     An hour later, BROWN leads DISRAELI up the hill.  BROWN has
     his head down, on with the job.  DISRAELI slows to a halt.

                    DISRAELI
          Princes and Lords are but the breath
          of kings, An honest man's the noblest
          work of God.
               (beat)
          You must miss such magnificent views.

                    BROWN
          I don't think about it.

     They reach the top and continue along the high ground. 
     DISRAELI glances at BROWN and notices the limp.

                    DISRAELI
          Forgive me, I've called you out and
          you should have been resting.

                    BROWN
          I'm fine.

                    DISRAELI
          You're injured.

                    BROWN
          It's nothing.

                    DISRAELI
          Still, someone must attend you.  Your
          wife should not have let you out.

                    BROWN
          I'm not married.

                    DISRAELI
               (deadpan)
          Oh.

                    BROWN
          This is the top.

     DISRAELI admires the view for a moment, then continues.

                    DISRAELI
          I confess, I sometimes feel as if I am
          not married myself, I see my wife so
          little.  But I'm forgetting the
          rewards.

     He looks across.  BROWN keeps staring ahead.

                    DISRAELI (CONT'D)
          The look on their faces when one walks
          into the room.  Still gives one a
          ridiculous thrill.

                    BROWN
          I wouldn't know.

                    DISRAELI
          Surely --

                    BROWN
               (interrupts)
          What I do, I do for my Queen.

                    DISRAELI
          Was there never ambition?

                    BROWN
               (beat)
          Maybe, once.

                    DISRAELI
          Then I envy yo.

                    BROWN
          Why?

                    DISRAELI
          To have achieved one's ambition, or to
          have reconciled oneself to its limits,
          is a lifetime's work.

                    BROWN
          I do what I do.

                    DISRAELI
          For Her Majesty.

                    BROWN
          Aye.

                    DISRAELI
          But yourself?
               (beat)
          What about John Brown?

                    BROWN
          I said.
               (beat)
          I serve the Queen.

                    DISRAELI
          No other aspiration?

     BROWN stares for a long moment.  Finally he speaks.

                    BROWN
          To see her safe.

     DISRAELI steps a little closer.

                    DISRAELI
          You will not be unaware of the threat
          now posed by Republicanism.

                    BROWN
          Why do you think I keep her here?

                    DISRAELI
          Ah, but therein lies the paradox.  It
          is her very isolation that encourages
          the malcontents.  The longer she is
          away, the stronger they become; and
          who, honestly, can promise security
          against that?  However many doors you
          lock, someone will always get in. 
          Even here.

     BROWN watches him, eyes alert.

                    BROWN
          So...?

                    DISRAELI
          The truth is, the Queen would be safer
          doing her duty and returning south to
          her public.  John Bull loves her and
          John Bull is her best defense.

                    BROWN
          Her mind is set.  She won't change
          now.

                    DISRAELI
          She trusts you, John.

     DISRAELI is right on his shoulder now, like his own voice.

                    BROWN
          They don't see it.

                    DISRAELI
          See what?

                    BROWN
          The threat.
               (beat)
          I tell them, but they don't see it.

                    DISRAELI
          They aren't as watchful as you.

                    BROWN
          Too busy looking after themselves.

                    DISRAELI
          The greasy pole.

                    BROWN
          No loyalty.

                    DISRAELI
          No love.

     Silence.  For a moment BROWN seems unaware that someone
     else has said that.

                    BROWN
          I promised to protect her from people
          like you.

                    DISRAELI
          For once in my life, I am not the
          issue.

                    BROWN
          She'll never understand it.

                    DISRAELI
          In time, she will.

                    BROWN
          She'll think I betrayed her.

                    DISRAELI
          But others will know that you acted
          for the greater good.

     BROWN stares off into the distance.

     EXT. LOCH MUICK - DAY

     The next day.

     BROWN is rowing VICTORIA across the loch.  The EQUERRIES
     wait on the shore.

     VICTORIA trails her hand in the water, frowning at the
     surface.  BROWN concentrates on the oars, slipping them
     carefully through the water.  

                    VICTORIA
          I received a letter today from Mr
          Disraeli.  Parliament is calling for
          my return to public duties.
               (beat)
          Why won't they let us be?

     BROWN does not answer.

                    VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          He insists that the country expects me
          to preside over the opening of the new
          session.  I refuse to offer sustenance
          to enable his weakening grip. 
          Besides, you know how much I should
          hate it.  It frightens me.

     She notices that BROWN has said nothing.

                    VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          John?

     BROWN does not look at her.  Finally:

                    BROWN
          We can't always have what we wish.

     VICTORIA stares at him.

     INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, QUEEN'S DRAWING ROOM - DAY

     Later that day.

     VICTORIA and BROWN are in the middle of a blazing row in
     front of the entire Household, including PONSONBY, JENNER
     and LADY ELY.

                    VICTORIA
          Duty?!  You talk about duty?!

                    BROWN
          If duty and safety are served by the
          same end then, aye, I do.

                    VICTORIA
          I cannot believe you are saying this? 
          You, who I have relied on all this
          time --

                    BROWN
               (cutting in)
          Have I ever let you down before--?

                    VICTORIA
               (as if he had not spoken)
          -- You stand there and tell me it is
          my duty ... after all you promised me!

                    BROWN
          I'm breaking no promises!

                    VICTORIA
          You are forcing me to do the very
          thing you know I fear most!

                    BROWN
          For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying
          to keep you safe!

                    VICTORIA
          I will not hear any more about my
          safety!!  You made me a promise and
          now you have broken it!

     BROWN rounds on her, deeply wounded.

                    BROWN
          -- When I took you out riding, come
          rain or shine, because I knew it was
          right for you, when I kept the bairns
          off your back so you could have a bit
          of peace, when I saw you safe from
          home to home and you didn't even know
          I was there...!  All I've ever thought
          about is you!

                    VICTORIA
          Then why send me back to them?!

                    BROWN
          Because I have to!
               (pause
          Will you no listen to me, woman?

     Face turned from him, VICTORIA replies in a brittle voice.

                    VICTORIA
          Do not presume to talk to your Queen
          in that manner.

     A long silence.  BROWN watches her, but she will not look
     at him again.  Finally, she walks very slowly across the
     room.  She turns in the doorway, her voice faltering
     slightly.

                    VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          Doctor Jenner, I feel unwell.  I shall
          retire to my chamber.  Please attend
          me presently.

     As the door slams, we ...

                              FADE TO BLACK.

     CAPTION: "NOVEMBER"

                              FADE IN:

     INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, DINING ROOM - DAY

     A few weeks later.

     Close on a door as it opens.  The ROYAL FAMILY are eating
     lunch with members of the UPPER HOUSEHOLD.  VICTORIA walks
     in with LADY ELY.

     A great scraping of chairs as everyone drops their forks
     and stands.  Clearly, they were not expecting her.  In
     silence, VICTORIA steps up and takes her place at the head
     of the table.

     At last, PONSONBY leans forward deferentially.

                    PONSONBY
          May I say, how glad I am to see Your
          Majesty so much recovered.

     VICTORIA nods, then turns and looks about at the others. 
     PRINCESS ALEXANDRA is seated at the far end of the table. 
     VICTORIA frowns.

                    VICTORIA
          Where is my son?

                    PRINCESS ALEXANDRA
          Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.

                    VICTORIA
          Why is he not here?

                    PRINCESS ALEXANDRA
          He is sick, ma'am.

                    VICTORIA
          Then why are you not with him?

                    PRINCESS ALEXANDRA
          You ordered all members of the Royal
          Family to attend you at Balmoral.

                    VICTORIA
          What is the matter with him?

                    PRINCESS ALEXANDRA
          He has typhoid fever, ma'am.

     VICTORIA stares blankly at DOCTOR JENNER.

                    VICTORIA
          No.  You are mistaken.  Prince Albert,
          my husband, had typhoid fever.  I
          asked what was wrong with my son.

                    JENNER
          The same, your Majesty.

     VICTORIA stops.  She stares down the length of the table. 
     A long pause.

                    VICTORIA
          Why was I not informed?

                    JENNER
          I did not consider it wise, in the
          circumstances, to tax your nerves.

                    VICTORIA
          How ill is he?

     No answer.

                    VICTORIA (CONT'D)
               (to Alexandra)
          Alex?

                    VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          He is not well, ma'am.

     A beat.

                    VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          I must go to him.

     Suddenly, VICTORIA stands.  Chairs bang back as everyone
     leaps to their feet.

                    VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          We must leave at once.

     Abruptly, VICTORIA turns for the door and the room erupts
     into activity.

     INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, CORRIDOR - DAY

     BROWN stands in the corridor, a little nonplussed by the
     servants and Householders hurrying about in every
     direction.

     EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY

     Half an hour later, BROWN races up to the Queen's carriage
     amid a swarm of servants, ladies' maids and Householders
     rushing to be ready in time.

     Suddenly the huge castle doors open and VICTORIA bustles
     out with her entourage in tow.  BROWN -- only just in time 
     - yanks open the door for VICTORIA to step past him and
     take her place.  She ignores him completely.

     BROWN slams the doors.  As he looks up, he sees his brother
     ARCHIE staring at him from across the courtyard.  For a
     second the two brothers hold each other's gaze.  It's
     obvious that ARCHIE has noticed the Queen's indifference. 
     BROWN turns away and mounts the box as the carriage races
     away under him.

     INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, PRINCE'S BEDCHAMBER - DAY

     Some days later.  A tableau.

     QUEEN VICTORIA sits at the foot of the bed, a matriarch
     surrounded by her ROYAL FAMILY.  They watch DOCTOR JENNER
     bend to examine the ghostly figure of BERTIE.  He listens
     for a pulse.  Finally, he looks up.

                    JENNER
          Better.

     VICTORIA lets out a deep breath.  She takes hold of
     PRINCESS ALEXANDRA'S hand.

                    VICTORIA
          Should the good Lord see fit to spare
          my son, I will order a mass to be
          celebrated at St. George's.  The
          people must share with their Queen,
          her prayers and hopes for their future
          King.

     INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CORRIDOR OUTSIDE BEDCHAMBER - DAY

     A few minutes later, BROWN stands in the corridor when the
     door bursts open and VICTORIA marches straight past him
     with PONSONBY at her side.

                    PONSONBY
               (aside to BROWN)
          The Queen will be riding to St.
          George's on the fifth.

                    BROWN
               (launching straight in)
          I recommend Her Majesty uses the
          covered carriage with a full Horse
          Guard.  In the event of any
          disturbance I will ensure --

                    VICTORIA
               (cutting in)
          I will ride to St. George's in an open
          carriage.  It is time the Queen was
          seen by her public.

     VICTORIA turns and disappears down the corridor, followed
     by PONSONBY.  We linger on BROWN'S humiliation, closer and
     closer until ...

     EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, ST. GEORGE'S - DAY

     Some weeks later.

     A series of angles on BROWN as he walks amid the mass of
     onlookers pressing against a cordon of guards surrounding
     the cathedral.  All the time, his eyes flick left and
     right, searching the faces in front of him for potential
     assassins.  Over his intense watchfulness we hear ...

                    DEAN WELLSELLY (O.S.)
          ... praise and magnify thy glorious
          name for that thou has raised thy
          servant Albert Edward, Prince of Wales
          from the bed of sickness. 
          We pray thee to perfect the recovery
          of thy servant and to crown him day by
          day with more abundant blessings both
          for body and soul, through Jesus
          Christ our Lord ...

     The CONGREGATION mutters a vast ...

                    CONGREGATION (O.S.)
          Amen.

     EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, ST. GEORGE'S - DAY

     VICTORIA and other members of the ROYAL FAMILY walk down
     the steps towards the cheering crowd.  As DEAN WELLSELLY
     and BROWN follow, BROWN sees ARTHUR O'CONNER break from the
     onlookers, pulling out a gun.  BROWN yells out:

                    BROWN
          NO!!

     He races toward O'CONNER and hits him flying, bangs him to
     the ground and twists the gun out of his hand.  As they
     fall we hear laughter and:

                    BERTIE (O.S.)
          So there he is, Arthur O'Conner...

     INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, DINING HALL - NIGHT

     It's a few days later and BERTIE is entertaining a private
     dinner party.  They include QUEEN VICTORIA, PRINCESS
     ALEXANDRA, PRINCESS LOUISE and HENRY PONSONBY.  BROWN is in
     attendance.  He stands off to one side, near the door.

                    BERTIE
               (bristling with confidence)
          ... all seven stone of the man,
          paddling madly towards us through a
          sea of Horse Guards, waving something
          that looks vaguely like a pen.  I
          thought he must be one of the mother's
          ardent readership in search of the
          Royal indenture...

     More chortling.  VICTORIA watches her son, smiling proudly. 
     BROWN looks straight ahead.

                    BERTIE (CONT'D)
          I believe I saw him first and then
          alerted Brown.  I'm not convinced that
          he wasn't taking a snooze on top of
          the box.  Anyway, we had our man
          pinned down and I must say, Brown
          acquitted himself admirably.  Of
          course the gun was a fake, but all the
          same, it was well done.

     No-one registers BROWN.  But while VICTORIA does not look
     at him, she is acutely aware of his presence.

                    VICTORIA
          I intend Brown to be rewarded with a
          special medal cast in gold.  It will
          be called The Devoted Service Medal.

     The guests applaud politely.  BERTIE clinks his glass for
     attention and raises it high.

                    BERTIE
          A toast.  Victoria Regina!

     The others raise their glasses in unison.

                    EVERYONE
          Victoria Regina!

     VICTORIA smiles.  BROWN remains alone by the door.

                    DISRAELI (O.S.)
          The people of England have expressed
          in a manner which cannot be mistaken,
          that they will uphold the ancient
          monarchy of England ...

     INT. CRYSTAL PALACE - DAY

     DISRAELI is delivering his come-back speech at a banquet of
     Tory delegates.

                    DISRAELI
          ... If the first great object of the
          Tory Party is to maintain the
          institutions of the country, the
          second is, in my opinion, to maintain
          the Empire of England ... the
          hereditary, the traditionary policy of
          the Tory Party.  Go to your homes,
          teach them these truths, which will
          soon be imprinted on the conscience of
          the land ...

                              FADE TO BLACK.

     CAPTION: "1883"

                              FADE IN:

     INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

     The sound of rain driven hard against a window.  We creep
     slowly down the corridor until we are back with the fifty
     year-old BROWN.  With his whiskey for company, he is
     sitting at his desk, writing in the diary.

     The diary-manuscript is now falling apart with wear, but
     there remain a few blank pages.  Slowly, he fills them in.

                    BROWN (V.O.)
          We should not live in expectation of
          contentment.  Fifteen years of
          vigilance will not guarantee peace of
          mind.  Yesterday, intruders were again
          reported in the South Wing.  I believe
          my prompt arrival may have averted any
          crisis, but it was a timely reminder. 
          It is a great comfort to me that my
          efforts in securing the Queen's safety
          over the years have not been in vain. 
          Certainly Her Majesty sends me no word
          that she's dissatisfied.  And I feel
          sure that if she were unhappy she
          would have found the occasion  to
          speak to me in person, as she has so
          often done in the past.

     A knock at the door.

                    BROWN (CONT'D)
          What is it?

     We hear a young PAGE, breathless from running.

                    PAGE
          North woods, sir.

     BROWN grabs his gun and rushes out.

     EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUADRANGLE - NIGHT

     BROWN appears at the door and strides into the storm.  He
     walks quickly across the wide quadrangle, rain soaking his
     hair and clothes.

     Two GUARDS watch BROWN as he races out into the storm.

     A coin flips through the air to be caught by an
     outstretched hand.  The second GUARD grins.

     EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE - NIGHT

     BROWN races across the open ground towards the forest.

     EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

     And now we are back with the opening sequence.  Truncated,
     severe, and shot from a slightly different angle.  The
     driving rain, BROWN hurtling through the trees, the crack
     to his left, he spins and plunges on.

     EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

     Close-up on BROWN as he bangs against a tree, heaving for
     air.  He searches the dark, stops, listens and races on.

     EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

     BROWN tears through the trees, pistol raised at full arm's
     length.

     EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

     He bursts into a clearing, breaks to the centre and stops.

     Pistol raised, he turns a circle, eyes on the wildly
     swaying trees.  A branch snaps behind him.  He spins round,
     bellows deep from his heart:

                    BROWN
          God save the Queen!!

     And fires.

     INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CORRIDOR - NIGHT

     A few days later.

     VICTORIA is moving swiftly down a long corridor with LADY
     ELY.  They arrive at a door.  VICTORIA stands facing it.

                    VICTORIA
               (quietly)
          How long has he been this sick?

                    LADY ELY
          A few days, ma'am.

                    VICTORIA
          Why was I not told earlier?

     LADY ELY doesn't answer.  VICTORIA knows anyway.  She nods. 
     LADY ELY knocks.  The door is opened by a young UNDER
     SERVANT who gawps at the sight of Her Majesty standing here
     in the servant's quarters.  VICTORIA walks in.

     INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

     The room has been cleared of bottles, but the thinness of
     the life here shocks her deeply.  The cheap furniture, the
     anonymous prints, the bed and, finally, the sight of BROWN.

     He is lying in bed, barely conscious.  After a moment, he
     opens his eyes and stares at her.  She steps forward,
     smiling nervously.

     Her voice is the old voice, between friends.

                    VICTORIA
          You should never have gone out in such
          foul weather.

                    BROWN
          Someone has to look after you.
               (pause)
          It could've been someone.  It was
          before.

                    VICTORIA
          Yes.  Yes it was.

     He cannot speak.  It's difficult for her too, but she
     speaks for him.

                    VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          My Ministers are as impertinent as
          ever.  Dispatches are now so numerous,
          they come in a trunk.  Sometimes I do
          believe they will never stop.  Endless
          letters...
           

     Her voice falters.  A pause

                    VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          I know I have not always been the
          loyal friend you deserved, John.  And
          yet here I am now, even now, feeling
          desperate at the thought of losing
          you.

     She starts to cry.

                    BROWN
          Don't be silly, woman.

     His old, familiar gruffness makes her smile and she pulls
     herself together.  Seeing a bowl of water on the side
     table, she steps across.  Carefully folding a cloth in
     four, she rinses it in the water and gently wipes his face. 
     Leaning closer, she is about to touch his face when BROWN
     gestures protectively.

                    BROWN (CONT'D)
          Not too near.

     INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CORRIDOR - DAY

     A week later.  PONSONBY and JENNER stand at the window
     overlooking the grounds.

                    JENNER
          Erysipelas.

                    PONSONBY
          Not too protracted, I hope.

                    JENNER
               (shakes his head)
          A few days...
               (beat)
          When he heard, the Prince of Wales
          threw the bust from the window of the
          Royal Gallery.  It took four hours to
          gather the fragments.

     A beat.

                    PONSONBY
          The Queen wishes to publish an account
          of him.

                    JENNER
          Dear oh dear.

                    PONSONBY
          We think she can be dissuaded.
               (beat)
          Have you had a glance at the diary?

                    JENNER
          Yes.

                    PONSONBY
          Quite.
               (beat)
          I think I'd best take it back.

                    JENNER
          Of course.

     He brings out BROWN'S tatty diary-manuscript and hands it
     over to PONSONBY.  The two men move away from the window,
     to go their separate ways.  Daily business beckons.

                    JENNER (CONT'D)
          Where did you find it by the way?

                    PONSONBY
          Some young page was boasting about
          having seen it.
               (beat)
          Lucky.

     JENNER nods.

                    JENNER
          Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry.

                    PONSONBY
          No, indeed.

     The two men head off in opposite directions down the
     corridor.
