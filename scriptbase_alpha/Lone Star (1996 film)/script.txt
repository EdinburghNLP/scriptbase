     EXT. TEXAS SCRUB -- DAY

     Two men in shorts and Hawaiian shirts are poking around a 
     sandy section in the middle of scrub flats. SERGEANT CLIFF 
     POTTS is in the f.g., a plant-and-tree guidebook in hand, as 
     SERGEANT "MIKEY" HOGAN works a metal detector over a large, 
     sandy bank in the b.g.  Both are Army career men with a 
     morning off to pursue their hobbies.

                    CLIFF
          We got ocotillo, devil's walking 
          stick--what's this stuff--it's that 
          whattayoucallit--horse-crippler.

     Mikey bends to scoop something out of the sand, putting it 
     in a canvas bag slung on his hip.

                    MIKEY
          This place is a gold mine.

                    CLIFF
          Lead mine.

     MIKEY sees that Cliff is talking, pulls his headset off.

                    MIKEY
          What?

                    CLIFF
          It's a lead mine.

                    MIKEY
          Right.

                    CLIFF
          I don't know why I'm talking to you, 
          you've got that thing on your head.

                    MIKEY
          You finding lots of cactus and shit?

                    CLIFF
          It's not just cactus.  There's the 
          nopals, the yuccas--

                    MIKEY
               (Puts headset on)
          Looks like a lot of cactus to me.

                    CLIFF
               (Grumbles)
          Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties 
          of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia  
          from a prickly pear.

                    MIKEY
               (Troubled)
          Cliff--

                    CLIFF
          You live in a place, you should know 
          something about it. Explore--

                    MIKEY
          Cliff--

     CU MIKEY

     MIKEY in the f.g. now, looking down at something as he pulls 
     his headset off again--

                    MIKEY
          Cliff, you gotta look at this--

     Cliff wearily turns and approaches from the b.g.

                    CLIFF
          Don't tell me--Spanish treasure, 
          right?  Pieces of eight from the  
          Coronado expedition--

     He stops by Mikey and looks down, his expression changing

                    CLIFF
          Jesus--

     GROUND -- CU BONES

     Sticking out from the sand bank are the SKELETAL BONES of a 
     MAN'S HAND.  There is a ring on one finger.

                    MIKEY (O.S.)
          Was Coronado in the Masons?

     EXT. ROAD -- DAY

     A distant cloud of DUST appears on the horizon MUSIC 
     underscores that we are in Texas, and we SUPERIMPOSE the 
     OPENING CREDITS as the dust takes form around an APPROACHING 
     CAR.  The car comes close enough to see it has a County 
     Sheriff's insignia on the side.

     INT. CAR

     We see SAM DEEDS, the Sheriff, driving. Sam is 40, quietly 
     competent to the point of seeming a bit moody. He sees 
     something up ahead.

     MUSIC, CREDITS END as Sam pulls off the road and we see the 
     sergeants standing in the scrub.

     EXT. SCRUB -- DAY -- BONES

     The hand and forearm down to the elbow of the skeleton are 
     visible now.

     WIDER

     Cliff stands looking at the arm with Sam. MIKEY is a few 
     yards behind them, playing with his metal detector. Beyond 
     him we see the Sheriff's car parked.

                    SAM
          I was driving back from Apache Wells 
          when they got me on the radio.

                    CLIFF
          This was a rifle range way back when. 
          But we figured it isn't Army land 
          anymore, it's your jurisdiction.

                    SAM
               (Nods)
          I've got the forensics fella coming 
          down from the Rangers. No way to  
          know how old the body is without 
          some lab work.

                    CLIFF
          That ring--

                    SAM
          Masons been around a long while.

     Mikey has come up to them, still sweeping with the metal 
     detector.

                    SAM
          Treasure hunter?

                    CLIFF
               (Apologetic)
          Old bullets.  He uhm-- makes art 
          with them.

     Sam just nods. Mikey frowns, goes down on one knee and 
     scratches something out of the dirt at their feet--

                    CLIFF
          The Sheriff says we shouldn't touch 
          anything,

                    MIKEY
               (To Sam)
          He can't hear with that rig on-- 
          Mikey!

     Mikey comes up with something, holds it before them. An 
     encrusted piece of metal--

                    MIKEY
          What've we got here?

     Sam takes the thing, lays it back down where Mikey found it.

                    SAM
          S'posed to leave everything right 
          where we found it. They're real 
          particular about that.

                    MIKEY
          The scene of the crime.

                    SAM
          No telling yet if there's been a 
          crime.

     Sam frowns down at the piece of metal as he rubs the face of 
     it.

     CU METAL

     Sam's thumb wipes across the face of the encrusted metal. It 
     is roughly star-shaped.

                    SAM (O.S.)
          But this country's seen a good number 
          of disagreements over the years.

     INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM -- DAY -- TEXAS MAP

     We look at a beautiful old pull-down map of Texas.

                    PILAR (O.S.)
          We do the best we can here--

     A teacher in her late 30s, PILAR CRUZ, steps in front of the 
     map and we FOLLOW her across the room, carrying a poster

                    PILAR
          --but hey, public education these 
          days is a bit of a battleground.

     Posters hung on the walls beyond her show luminaries from 
     Texas history-- Sam Houston, Stephen Austin, Juan Seguin. A 
     new parent, CELIE PAYNE, stands in the middle of the otherwise 
     empty classroom.

                    CELIE
          He went to school on base when we 
          were in Okinawa. It's all--you know--
          kids in the same boat--Army brats.

                    PILAR
          His record shows that he's a good 
          student.

                    CELIE
          I'm more worried about the social 
          thing. Are therelike--gangs, or...?

     PILAR starts to put the poster up. CELIE moves to hold it in 
     place for her.

                    PILAR
          We haven't had any serious violence, 
          if that's what you mean. We've got a 
          pretty lively mix though--you walk 
          into the cafeteria and the Anglo 
          kids are in one section, the Mexican 
          kids in another and the Black kids 
          have a table in the back--thanks--

                    CELIE
          So Blacks are--

                    PILAR
          They're the smallest group except 
          for a couple Kickapoo kids. Look, 
          you're obviously a concerned parent. 
          Chet has no history of getting into 
          trouble--I'm happy to have him in my 
          class.

     She steps back to see if the poster, an old photo of Geronimo, 
     looks straight. Another teacher, MOLLY sticks her head in 
     the door--

                    MOLLY
               (Uncomfortable)
          Pilar, is uhm--is Amado okay?

                    PILAR
          Okay? He's not here?

                    MOLLY
          No. Is he sick?

                    PILAR
               (Mutters)
          He's going to wish he was dead.

     EXT. STREET -- DAY -- CU VAQUERO PICTURE

     On the door of a deluxe pickup truck is an airbrushed picture 
     of a Pancho Villa-looking vaquero with bandoliers crossing 
     his chest and a gun blazing in each hand. We hear LOUD MUSIC--

                    AMADO (O.S.)
          Luis! Give me that Phillips-head 
          back--

     WIDER

     A small group of teenage Chicano BOYS hang around the truck 
     in the bed, on the hood, leaning against it. A BOOMBOX placed 
     on top of the cab blasts RANCHA MUSIC out at the neighborhood. 
     Somebody's legs are hanging out the open passenger-side door. 
     The kids suddenly look as a Sheriff's Department car slides 
     into the f.g.  A Deputy Sheriff, TRAVIS, gets out.

     KIDS

     Trying to look tough and unworried as we TRACK across the 
     street toward them. Travis's hand reaches out from behind 
     the camera to flick the MUSIC OFF.

     INT. PICKUP

     AMADO CRUZ, Pilar's 15-year-old son, lies on the front seat 
     installing a compact disc player into the dash slot. He 
     reaches up to the dash, can't find what he wants.

                    AMADO
          Somebody hand me the CD player-- 
          damelo pendejos--

     He looks up and we TILT to see Travis leaning in the window,     
     examining the new radio

                    TRAVIS
          They come a long way from those old 
          8-track jobs, haven't they?

                    AMADO
          Something wrong?

                    TRAVIS
               (Waves radio)
          This is stolen property. Alla you 
          fellas are coming down to the station.

     INT. CAFE SANTA BARBARA -- AFTERNOON -- ENRIQUE

     Sweat beads the forehead of a thin, tired-looking recent 
     immigrant, ENRIQUE, as he delivers platters of chile rellenos 
     to a booth. MEXICAN MUSIC plays on a jukebox in the b.g. We 
     HOLD on the booth, where HOLLIS POGUE, in his 60s entertains 
     two GOOD OLD BOYS--

                    HOLLIS
          So Buddy walks up to the porch and 
          there's old Fishbait McHenry, cleanin' 
          the dirt out his toenails with a 
          pocketknife--he was the most hygienic 
          of all the McHenrys--

     The breakfast companions are laughing already--

                    HOLLIS
          "Fishbait," says Buddy, in that quiet 
          way of his, "What you know about 
          them tires that went missing from 
          markets?" Fishbait thinks for a 
          minute, then he lifts up a loose 
          board from the porch floor and calls 
          down into it, "C'mon out, Pooter, 
          they caught us!"

                    FENTON
               (Laughing)
          Buddy Deeds. He had a way.

                    HOLLIS
          He known who it was onnacouna the 
          tire tracks in the dirt from the 
          back of the garage to where they 
          loaded up. "Old Fishbait," he says, 
          "never lifted a thing in this world 
          if there was a way he could roll 
          it."

     More laughter--

                    FENTON
          Won't be another like him. That boy 
          of his doesn't come near it. You ask 
          me, he's all hat and no cattle

                    SAM (O.S.)
          Fellas--

     We WIDEN to see Sam standing by their booth. No telling how 
     long he's been listening, Fenton is embarrassed.

                    HOLLIS
          Sam! I was just telling a few about 
          your old man.

                    FENTON
          He was a unique individual.

                    SAM
          Yeah, he was that.

     We sense a little strain when Sam has to talk about his father--

                    HOLLIS
          Big day coming up--I wish we'd have 
          thought of it while he was still 
          living. But he went so unexpected.

                    FENTON
          Better late than never. Korean War 
          hero, Sheriff for near thirty years-- 
          Buddy Deeds Memorial P--

                    SAM
          I heard there was a bit of a fuss.

                    HOLLIS
          Oh, you know, the usual troublemakers. 
          Danny Padilla from the Sentinel, 
          that crowd.

                    FENTON
          Every other damn thing in the country 
          is called after Martin Luther King, 
          they can't let our side have one 
          measly park?

                    HOLLIS
          King wasn't Mexican, Fenton--

                    FENTON
          Bad enough all the street names are 
          in Spanish--

                    SAM
          They were here first.

                    FENTON
          Then name it after Big Chief 
          Shitinabucket! Whoever that Tonkawa 
          fella was. He had the Mexes beat by 
          centuries.

                    HOLLIS
          There was a faction pulling for that 
          boy who was killed in the Gulf War-- 
          Ruben--

                    SAM
          --Santiago.

                    HOLLIS
          Right. But nobody here ever noticed 
          him till they read his name on the 
          national news--

                    FENTON
          They just wanted it to be one of 
          theirs--

                    HOLLIS
          That's not the whole story. The 
          Mexicans that know, that remember, 
          understand what Buddy was for their 
          people.  Hell, it was Mercedes over 
          there who swung the deciding vote 
          for him.

     Sam looks to the register where Pilar's mother, MERCEDES 
     CRUZ, whacks rolls of change apart on the counter. She seems 
     to be avoiding looking toward him.

                    SAM
          That so?

                    HOLLIS
          She put it even at three to three, 
          so as the Mayor I get to cast the 
          tiebreaker. The older generation 
          won't have any problem with it. They 
          remember how Buddy come to be Sheriff, 
          that it was all 'cause he took their 
          part.

                    FENTON
          Tell that one, Hollis--

                    HOLLIS
          Hell, everybody heard that story a 
          million times.

                    SAM
          I'd like to hear it. Your version of 
          it.

     Something about the way Sam says it puts Hollis on guard.

                    FENTON
          Go ahead, Hollis.

     CU HOLLIS

     Hollis is hooked into it now--

                    HOLLIS
          The two of us were the only deputies 
          back then me and Buddy--it's what--
          '58--

                    FENTON (O.S.)
          '57, 1 believe--

                    HOLLIS
          And the Sheriff at the time was Big 
          Charley Wade. Charley was one of 
          your old-fashioned bribe-or-bullets 
          kind of Sheriffs, he took a healthy 
          bite out of whatever moved through 
          this county.

     He looks down at the table--

                    HOLLIS
          It was in here one night, back  when 
          Jimmy Herrera run the place.   Started 
          right here in this booth.

     We PAN down to the table, The food has changed. The tortillas 
     are in a straw basket instead of plastic. The jukebox changes 
     to ANOTHER SONG and the LIGHT DIMS slightly. A hand with a 
     big Masonic ring on one finger appears to lift a tortilla--
     underneath it lie three ten-dollar bills.  The hand lifts 
     them up and we TILT to see the face of SHERIFF CHARLEY WADE, 
     a big, mean redneck with shrewd eyes. It is 1957--

                    WADE
               (Grins)
          This beaner fare doesn't agree with 
          me, but the price sure is right.

     WIDER

     Wade sits across from his young deputies, YOUNG HOLLIS (30s) 
     and BUDDY DEEDS (20s). A chicken-fried steak sits untouched 
     in front of Buddy. Hollis has the anxious look of an errand 
     boy, while Buddy is self-contained and quietly forceful for 
     his age.

                    BUDDY
          What's that for?

                    WADE
          Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, 
          most of 'em relatives. People breed 
          like chickens.

                    BUDDY
          So?

                    WADE
          I roust some muchacho on the street, 
          doesn't have his papers, all he got 
          to say is "Yo trabajo para Jimmy 
          Herrera."

     Wade folds the money and stuffs if in his pocket--

                    WADE
          You got to keep the wheels greased, 
          son. Sheriff does his job right, 
          everybody makes out. Now this is 
          gonna be one of your pickups, Buddy. 
          First of the month, just like the 
          rent. Get the car, Hollis.

     Wade and Hollis slide out of the booth to stand.

                    BUDDY
          I'm not doing it.

     Hollis stops a few feet away, shocked. Wade just stares down 
     at Buddy.

                    WADE
          Come again?

     Buddy looks Wade in the eye, seemingly unafraid.

                    BUDDY
          It's your deal. You sweated it out 
          of him, you pick it up.

                    WADE
          There's gonna be some left over for 
          you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.

                    BUDDY
          That's not the point.

                    WADE
          You feeling bad for Jimmy? Have him 
          tell you the size of the mordida 
          they took out of his hide when he 
          run a place on the other side. Those 
          old boys in Ciudad Leon--

                    BUDDY
          I'm not picking it up.

                    WADE
          You do whatever I say you do or else 
          you put it on the trail, son.

     The CUSTOMERS are all watching now, nervous. Buddy thinks 
     for a moment, not taking his eyes off Wade.

                    BUDDY
          How 'bout this--how 'bout you put 
          that shield on this table and  vanish 
          before you end up dead or in jail?

     Wade rests his hand on his pistol.  It is dead silent but 
     for the MUSIC on the box.

                    BUDDY
          You ever shoot anybody was looking 
          you in the eye?

                    WADE
          Who said anything about shootin' 
          anybody?

     Buddy has his gun out under the table.  He slowly brings it 
     up and lays it flat on the table, not taking his hand off it 
     or his eyes off Wade.

                    BUDDY
          Whole different story; isn't it?

                    WADE
          You're fired. You're outta the 
          department.

                    BUDDY
          There's not a soul in this county 
          isn't sick to death of your bullshit, 
          Charley. You made yourself scarce, 
          you could make a lot of people happy.

                    WADE
          You little pissant--

                    BUDDY
          Now or later, Charley. You won't 
          have any trouble finding me.

     Wade feels the people around him waiting for a reaction.  He 
     leans close to Buddy to croak in a hoarse whisper.

                    WADE
          You're a dead man.

     He turns and nearly bumps into Hollis. He gives the Deputy a 
     shove.

                    WADE
          Get the goddamn car. We're going to 
          Roderick's.

     CU BUDDY

     He watches till the screen door shuts behind them, then 
     holsters his gun and begins to saw at the steak as if nothing 
     had happened. He calls softly--

                    BUDDY
          Muchacho--mas cerveza por favor.

     He looks up at somebody and we PAN till we see Sam, still 
     standing over the booth, listening. We are back in 1995--

                    HOLLIS (O.S.)
          "Mas cerveza por favor."

                    FENTON (O.S.)
          That Buddy was a cool breeze.

     We PULL BACK to see Hollis and his buddies at the table, 
     eating their lunches as they listen.

                    FENTON
          Charley Wade were known to have put 
          a good number of people in the ground, 
          and your daddy gets eyeball to eyeball 
          with him.

                    HOLLIS
          We made our collection at Roderick's 
          place and that was the last anybody 
          seen hide nor hair of him.  He went 
          missing the next day, along with ten 
          thousand dollars in county funds 
          from the safe at the jail.

                    SAM
          Never heard from him again?

                    HOLLIS
          Not a peep. Buddy run the man out of 
          town.

                    FENTON
          Buddy Deeds said a thing, he damn 
          well backed it up. Won't be another 
          like him.

                    SAM
          So he arrested all of Jimmy Herrera's 
          people and sent 'em back to the other 
          side?

     Hollis sees what Sam is getting at, grins--

                    HOLLIS
          Oh--he come to an accommodation. 
          Money doesn't always need to change 
          hands to keep the wheels turning.

                    SAM
          Right.

                    HOLLIS
          Look, I know you had some problems 
          with your father, and he and Muriel-- 
          well--

                    FENTON
          Your mother was a saint.

                    HOLLIS
          --but Buddy Deeds was my salvation.

     Sam nods, speaks softly--

                    SAM
          Won't be another like him.

     EXT. ARMY INSTALLATION -- DAY -- CU DEL PAYNE

     COLONEL DELMORE PAYNE (DEL), a very direct, by-the-book Black 
     officer, addresses them. Artillery pieces angle toward the 
     sky behind him--

                    DEL
          --it's an honor for me to assume 
          command of this unit, and I look 
          forward to working with all of you.

     OFFICERS Cliff and Mikey, in uniform now, flank SERGEANT 
     PRISCILLA WORTH, a Black woman in her early 40s, as they 
     stand in formation--

                    DEL (O.S.)
          I'm sure you're all aware of the 
          Army's decision to close this 
          installation under the Reduction in 
          Force plan. That does not mean, 
          however--

     REVERSE

     We look over the shoulders of assembled OFFICERS and NCOs 
     toward Del.

                    DEL
          --that we've been sent here to mark 
          time until we are absorbed by another 
          unit.

     CU DEL

                    DEL
          You may have heard rumors that I run 
          a very tight operation. These rumors 
          are not exaggerated.

     INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON -- BUDDY PHOTO

     We are looking through a magnifying glass at an old photo. 
     Buddy's face is slightly distorted by the glass.

                    SECRETARY (O.S.)
          Sam? I got Danny Padilla from the 
          paper for you--

     Sam sits at his desk in the Sheriff's office, looking down 
     at the photo--

                    SAM
          Tell him I'll catch him later.

     CU PHOTOGRAPH

     An old photo of the 1957 Sheriff's Department officers on 
     the courthouse steps. Wade, Hollis, Buddy, a few others, all 
     in uniform.

                    SECRETARY (O.S.)
          He says he needs to talk to you before 
          the ceremony, Sam.

     Sam puts a magnifying glass over the photo and bends close 
     to look.

                    SAM
          Tell him to try me tomorrow.

     EXTREME CU PHOTO -- BADGE

     MAGNIFIED POV of the badge on Wade's chest swims into view. 
     A metal star. We hear the secretary getting rid of the caller.

                    SECRETARY (O.S.)
          He thinks you're trying to duck  
          him.

     CU SAM

     Looking at the photo, troubled--

                    SAM
               (Mutters)
          He's right.

     EXT. BIG O'S ROADHOUSE -- NIGHT -- NEON SIGN

     We start on a BLINKING SIGN--BIG O'S, then PAN to see a full 
     parking lot outside the low, neon-lit roadhouse. R&B MUSIC 
     blasts from inside.

     EXT. DOORWAY -- CHET

     CHET, a Black kid around 15, stands nervously at the door 
     building up his courage.  He takes a deep breath, plunges 
     in.

     INT. BIG O'S

     We TRACK with Chet, very nervous, as he makes his way through 
     the crowded roadhouse. The customers are all Black, many 
     from the nearby Army post, SHOUTING and LAUGHING over the 
     loud MUSIC. Chet, edgy, is looking for somebody.  He sees...

     CHET'S POV -- OTIS

     Seen through the crush is OTIS "BIG O" PAYNE, a large man in 
     his early 60s, laughing as he stands behind the bar.

     CHET

     He nervously puts his hand under his jacket. A gun? He pushes 
     forward to get a better view.

     CHET'S POV -- OTIS

     Moving in on him. Otis looks over, sees the boy, frowns--

     CHET

     Reaching under his jacket, he pulls out--a photograph. He 
     looks at it--suddenly there is a SCREAM from behind, then 
     GUNSHOTS, patrons diving for the floor.

     Chet whirls around and we WHIP PAN to see a young man, SHADOW, 
     emptying his pistol into RICHIE, a young soldier, as a young 
     woman, ATHENA, screams and tries to pull the gun away. With 
     the last shot, Shadow turns and heads for the door, but is 
     tackled and swarmed by angry men, SHOUTING.

     We PAN to Athena, kneeling over the bleeding, twitching body 
     of Richie--

     CHET

     Chet backs up, horrified. A large hand grasps him on the 
     shoulder from behind. He turns to see Otis standing over 
     him, strangely calm amid the chaos

                    OTIS
          You weren't in here tonight, were  
          you?

                    CHET
          No sir.

                    OTIS
               (Points)
          Go out through the back.

     Chet hurries away.  Otis watches him for a moment, then turns 
     to the mess in his club.

     INT. AUDITORIUM -- NIGHT -- CU ANGLO MOTHER

     An angry woman stands from her auditorium chair--

                    ANGLO MOTHER
          You're just tearin' everything  down!  
          Tearin' down our heritage, tearin' 
          down the memory of people that fought 
          and died for this land.

                    CHICANO FATHER (O.S.)
          We fought and died for this land, 
          too!

     We WHIP PAN to see another standing parent--

                    CHICANO FATHER
          We fought the U.S. Army, the Texas 
          Rangers--

                    ANGLO FATHER (O.S.)
          Yeah, but you lost, buddy!

     We WHIP PAN to a man in the rear--

                    ANGLO FATHER
          Winners get the bragging rights, 
          that's how it goes.

                    PRINCIPAL (O.S.)
          People--people--

     WIDER

     We are in the High School auditorium, a hot-and-heavy teachers-
     and-parents meeting in progress. Pilar sits at the end of a 
     long table facing the agitated parents, taking some heat. 
     DANNY PADILLA, a young, long-haired reporter, sits in the 
     front taking notes, enjoying the show.

                    PRINCIPAL
          I think it would be best not to put 
          things in terms of winners and losers--

                    ANGLO MOTHER
               (Points at Pilar)
          Well, the way she's teachin' it has 
          got everything switched around. I 
          was on the textbook committee, and 
          her version is not--

                    PRINCIPAL
          We think of the textbook as kind of 
          a guide, not an absolute--

                    ANGLO MOTHER
          --it is not what we set as the 
          standard! Now you people can believe 
          what you want, but when it comes to 
          teaching our children--

                    CHICANO MOTHER
          They're our children, too!

                    ANGLO FATHER
          The men who founded this state have 
          a right to have their story--

                    DANNY
          The men who founded this state broke 
          from Mexico because they needed 
          slavery to be legal to make a fortune 
          in the cotton business!

                    PILAR
          I think that's a bit of an 
          oversimplification--

                    ANGLO FATHER
          Are you reporting this meeting or 
          runnin' it, Danny?

                    DANNY
          Just adding a little historical 
          perspective--

     REAR OF AUDITORIUM

     PALOMA CRUZ, Pilar's teenage daughter, peeks into the room, 
     then moves down the side toward the stage.

                    ANGLO FATHER
          You may call it history, but I call 
          it propaganda. I'm sure they got 
          their own account of the Alamo on 
          the other side, but we're not on the 
          other side, so we're not about to 
          have it taught in our schools!

                    PILAR
          There's no reason to be so threatened 
          by this--

     Pilar is trying to stay calm despite her anger.

                    PILAR
          I've only been trying to get across 
          some of the complexity of our 
          situation down here--cultures coming 
          together in both negative and positive 
          ways.

                    ANGLO MOTHER (O.S.)
          If you mean like music and food and 
          all, I have no problem with that.

     REVERSE

     We shoot past Pilar toward the parents in their seats. PALOMA 
     steps up to whisper to her.

                    ANGLO MOTHER
          --but when you start changing who 
          did what to who.

                    TEACHER
          We're not changing anything, we're 
          presenting a more complete picture.

                    ANGLO MOTHER
          And that's what's got to stop!

     Pilar looks troubled by what she's heard. She shoots a look 
     toward the others at the table, then slips away with Paloma--

                    TEACHER
          There's enough ignorance in the world 
          without us encouraging it in the 
          classroom--

                    ANGLO MOTHER
          Now who are you calling ignorant?

                    PRINCIPAL
          Folks, I know this is a very emotional 
          issue for some of you, but we do 
          have other business to attend to--

                    CHICANO FATHER
          We're not going to get some resolution 
          on this?

     CU PRINCIPAL

     Weary--

                    PRINCIPAL
          Would you people like to form another 
          committee?

     GROANS from the parents--

     INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE -- NIGHT -- SHADOW

     Shadow, face bruised, hands cuffed behind him, is pushed in 
     through the door to be booked.

                    SHADOW
          I hope the sucker does die, man! 
          Mess with me, that's what you get!

     Sam steps in behind him and meets his Chief Deputy RAY 
     HERNANDEZ, coming from the other direction.

                    RAY
          Hospital says the other kid is in 
          bad shape--

                    SAM
               (Glances ahead)
          The shooter local?

                    RAY
               (Shakes his bead)
          Down from Houston. I think he knew 
          the girl before.

                    SAM
          Okay--we'll take a statement from 
          all the GIs before they go back to 
          post. You can get the story from 
          Otis over at the club.

                    RAY
          Any poop on the John Doe you found 
          out there today?

                    SAM
          Nothin' much. The Rangers put Ben 
          Wetzel on it. Catch you later.

     As Ray steps out, Pilar looking distraught, walks into the 
     station, passing right by Sam without seeing him.

     CU SAM

     Wonders what she's doing there--

     SAM'S POV -- PILAR

     She stands by an unoccupied reception desk, very upset, unable 
     to attract anyone's attention because of the activity around 
     the shooting.  She looks tired and a bit scared under the 
     harsh overhead light.

                    SAM (O.S.)
          Pilar.

     PILAR AND SAM

     Pilar looks around. Sam is standing by her. We can tell there 
     is some history between these two.

                    SAM
          Something wrong?

                    PILAR
          They've got my Amado.

                    SAM
          Got him here?

                    PILAR
          Somebody called--something about an 
          electronics store.

                    SAM
          I'll see what's going on.

     He starts away, stops, comes back--

                    SAM
          I was--I was real sorry about Nando. 
          He was a good fella. We haven't talked 
          since.

                    PILAR
          We haven't talked since high school.

                    SAM
          Yeah. I'll go check on your boy.

     Pilar watches Sam go--

     REAR OF OFFICE

     Travis sits typing away at a word processor as Athena, in 
     tears, gives testimony.

                    ATHENA
          --so Richie just didn't say nothin' 
          'cause he didn't want to get into 
          it, see, and the next thing I know 
          there's shots and Richie is down. It 
          happened so fast--

                    SAM (O.S.)
          Excuse me--

     We WIDEN to see Sam standing over the desk--

                    SAM
          We got some boys you run in earlier 
          today?

                    TRAVIS
          Yeah. I pulled the bunch that hangs 
          at Pico Bernal's place. We finally 
          caught them with something.

                    SAM
          You got a juvenile with 'ern--Amado 
          Cruz?

     Travis looks at his booking sheets--

                    TRAVIS
          Yeah--let's see--the other ones say 
          he wasn't in on the theft, he just 
          knows how to hook things up. We've 
          been trying to contact a parent.

     INT. JAIL HALLWAY

     Sam walks with Amado, who is trying to look defiant--

                    SAM
          They tell me you're good at fixing 
          things.

     Nothin--

                    SAM
          Your father was a hell of a mechanic.

     Still nothing--

                    SAM
          You know, if you figure minimum wage 
          on the time most thieves spend in 
          jail, they could have bought most 
          everything they stole.

                    AMADO
          I didn't steal anything.

                    SAM
          I didn't say you did. My name is 
          Sam, by the way.

     Amado just gives him a look--

     INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE

     Sam and AMADO step out into the office, where Pilar stands 
     waiting.

                    SAM
          He's all yours.

                    PILAR
          Are you okay?

                    AMADO
          I don't know what the big deal is.

                    PILAR
          You'll find out when I get you home. 
          Thanks, Sam.

                    SAM
          No problem.

     Pilar yanks AMADO outside by his arm. She turns to shoot a 
     look back at Sam, then steps out through the glass door.

     CU SAM

     Watching her go--

                    SAM
          Any time.

                                    FADE OUT:

     EXT. OBSTACLE COURSE -- MORNING -- PIT

     We shoot up from a pit in the ground. WHUMP! WHUMP! WHUMP! 
     Three men leap over, landing on the far side and running 
     away from us.

     MEN

     Del Payne runs with Cliff and Mikey on a pathway along a 
     security fence, the two sergeants struggling to keep up, 
     occasionally vaulting or scaling some mild obstacle.

                    MIKEY
          There's not that much down here, 
          Colonel. Big O's is the only place 
          in the county that our African 
          American soldiers are uhm--that they 
          feel comfortable in.

                    DEL
          Have we had trouble there before?

                    CLIFF
          Since I've been stationed here? A 
          fistfight now and then--

                    MIKEY
          We had a kid pass out in the men's 
          room. The town isn't much.

                    DEL
          They didn't come for a vacation.

                    CLIFF
          Yes sir.

                    MIKEY
          You know how it is, Colonel--first 
          time away from home, dealing with 
          new people--I remember my first hitch--

                    DEL
          Substance abuse?

                    MIKEY
          Well, yeah, but I went through the 
          Program. I haven't had a drink since--

                    DEL
          I meant on the post. In general. How 
          are you dealing with it?

                    CLIFF
          We throw a urine test at them once a 
          month. Random numbers, maybe a hundred 
          people at a time

                    DEL
          Why don't we make it once a week for 
          a while?

                    CLIFF
          No problem, sir.

     Del notices bow hard they are breathing--

                    DEL
          I sprint the last quarter mile. You 
          gentlemen don't have to keep up if 
          you don't care to.

                    MIKEY
          Appreciate it, sir.

     Del accelerates and we HOLD with the sergeants, slowing to a 
     near-walk.

                    MIKEY
          Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.

                    CLIFF

          You get the feeling he doesn't want 
          to be here?

     INT. FORENSICS LAB -- VARIOUS SHOTS

     We hear Hank Williams' gospel song "I'll Have a New Body 
     (I'll Have a New Life)" as we see the gathered bones of the 
     skeleton tagged and photographed and measured, impressions 
     made of the dental work in the skull, photographs of the 
     excavation of the body at various stages marked with red 
     grease pencil, the piece of metal laid in a de-tarnishing 
     dish, the ring put under a microscope.

     CU METAL

     MUSIC CONTINUES as we TIGHTEN on the piece of metal, a pair 
     of tongs pulling it from the de-tarnishing solution. It is a 
     star-shaped badge, bearing the words "SHERIFF--RIO COUNTY."

     INT. COUNTRY AND WESTERN BAR -- AFTERNOON

     C&W MUSIC playing, the regulars starting to show up. Sam 
     makes his way to a table where BEN WETZEL, a Texas Ranger, 
     sits with a file of forensic reports.

                    BEN
          Sam the Man.

                    SAM
          Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.

     They shake, Sam sits.

                    BEN
          How's business?

                    SAM
          Business is booming. Got your drugs, 
          got your illegals--had a shooting 
          the other night at Big O's--Soldier 
          got ventilated.

                    BEN
          I hear they're closing that post 
          down.

                    SAM
          September '97, that's all she wrote.

                    BEN
          Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this 
          county.

                    SAM
          Yeah, we'll have folks swimming over 
          to Mexico to work in the sweatshops.

     Sam looks at the folder of reports.

                    SAM
          That the word on our boy?

                    BEN
          Yeah, this is Skinny.

                    SAM
          Skinny?

                    BEN
          We find a body, it's either Skinny 
          or Stinky, depending on how much 
          meat there is on the bones.

                    SAM
          Nice job.

                    BEN
               (Opens folder)
          Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot-
          eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get 
          into the dental records--

                    SAM
          Charley Wade.

                    BEN
               (Nods)
          That badge--

                    SAM
          --it didn't come out of a cereal 
          box.

                    BEN
          Yeah.

                    SAM
          You know the popular version of how 
          he left town.

                    BEN
          Everybody on the border knows that 
          story.

                    SAM
          You got a cause of death?

                    BEN
          Skull was intact, no soft tissue 
          left--not much to go on.

                    SAM
          So he could have gone out to the 
          base, hopped the fence, dug down 
          into the dirt on the old rifle range 
          and had a heart attack.

     Ben smiles, closes the folder--

                    BEN
          You uhm--you remember what old Buddy 
          carried for a side arm?

                    SAM
          Colt Peacemaker.

                    BEN
          A .45--

                    SAM
          He swore by it.
               (Ben frowns)
          What?

                    BEN
          Just wondering.

                    SAM
          So is Buddy on your short list?

                    BEN
          If it was some poor mojado, swam 
          across at night, got lost in the 
          scrub and starved out there, we 
          wouldn't go any further. But this is 
          a formerly prominent citizen.

                    SAM
          You got to investigate. No question 
          about it.

                    BEN
          What I will do is keep names out of 
          it till we got some answers or hit a 
          dead end. You know how the press is 
          with a murder story--even if it's 
          forty years old.

                    SAM
          Yeah, it's a pretty cold trail.

     They sit in awkward silence for a moment. Ben feels bad about 
     it.

                    BEN
          I remember Charley Wade come to my 
          father's hardware store once when I 
          was a little boy. I'd heard stories 
          how he shot this one, how he shot 
          that one--man winked at me and I 
          peed in my pants.
               (Shakes his head)
          Winked at me.

     INT. CLASSROOM -- DAY

     Pilar stands at the blackboard by her outline of 19th century 
     Texas history.

                    PILAR
          Okay, we have the fight against the 
          Spanish with bloody conflict for 
          dozens of years till they're finally 
          defeated in 1821 and Mexican 
          independence is declared. Anglo 
          settlers are invited--

     CU DRAWING

     Somebody making a skillful pencil drawing on the corner of a 
     sheet of lined notebook paper. A bald, muscular shotputter 
     after releasing the shot, his hand large in the f.g.

                    PILAR (O.S.)
          --to colonize the area and by the 
          time they begin the movement against 
          Santa Anna they outnumber the Mexicans 
          here by four to one. The war between 
          Mexico--

     CHET

     Drawing intently. He takes the notebook and lays his thumb 
     over the corner.

                    PILAR (O.S.)
          and the Anglo forces ends in 1836 
          with the formation of the Texas 
          Republic. Texas joins the United 
          States as a state where slavery is 
          legal in 1845--

     NOTEBOOK

     Chet "flips" the corner of the notebook and the series of 
     drawings he's made form a brief cartoon of the shot-putter 
     blowing his cheeks out and heaving the shot right past us. 
     Extremely well-drawn--

                    PILAR (O.S.)
          after the so-called Mexican war and 
          then secedes to join the Confederacy 
          in 1861. The Confederacy is beaten, 
          and the Reformation period here is 
          marked by range wars and race wars--

     PILAR

     Looking out at the class--

                    PILAR
          --and all this paralleled by constant 
          battles between both the Mexican and 
          Anglo settlers and the various Indian 
          nations in the area. What are we 
          seeing here? Chet?

     CHET

     Startled, he hides the notebook under his hands --

                    CHET
          Uhm--everybody is killing everybody 
          else?

     EXT. LAKE -- DAY -- CU FISHING LURE

     A nasty-looking thing. Only a bass would want to eat this. 
     Hollis leans in to peer at the thing dangling before his 
     face.

     WIDER

     Hollis sits in the swivel chair of a bass boat tied to a 
     dock at the lake, going through his box of lures. Sam appears 
     on the dock and steps down.

                    SAM
          I always wondered what you Mayors do 
          when you're not cutting ribbons.

                    HOLLIS
          Sam! Hey podner! You caught me playing 
          hooky--

                    SAM
               (Looks across lake)
          Floating around out here, playin' 
          hell with them bass--play a little 
          cards, play a little golf, drink 
          some beer--

                    HOLLIS
          Sounds great. Where do I sign up?

                    SAM
          I haven't been out here for a while.

                    HOLLIS
          You go by your old house?

                    SAM
          No.

                    HOLLIS
          Just as well. The new people just 
          painted it some God-awful color--

                    SAM
          We found a body out by the Army base 
          yesterday. Been there for a long 
          time.

     Hollis squints at a rubber lure, rejects it--

                    HOLLIS
          Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?

                    SAM
               (Smiles)
          You recall if Charley Wade was a 
          Mason?

                    HOLLIS
          Charley? I believe he was. Used to 
          go for lodge meetings over to Laredo. 
          What's he got to do with your body?

                    SAM
          All it was wearing was a big old 
          Masonic ring and a Rio County Sheriffs 
          badge.

     Hollis reacts. Sam puts a foot on the gunwale of the boat.

                    SAM
          You don't remember anything else 
          from that last night you saw him, do 
          you?

                    HOLLIS
          I told the story enough times--hell, 
          we were just in the car, he was 
          stewing about the fight with Buddy 
          while we drove over to Roderick 
          Bledsoe's--

                    SAM
          Bledso

                    HOLLIS
          He owned the colored roadhouse before 
          Big O--

                    SAM
          He still living?

                    HOLLIS
          No. I think his widow's still in 
          their place in Darktown, though.
               (Shakes his bead)
          You think it's Charley Wade, huh?

                    SAM
          Forensics people are sure of it. You 
          have any idea who might have put him 
          there?

     Hollis makes a great show of considering--

                    SAM
          Besides my father, I mean.

                    HOLLIS
          There's no call for that, Sam. Fella 
          made himself a pile of enemies over 
          the years.

                    SAM
          And Buddy was one of them.

                    HOLLIS
          We got that dedication tomorrow. 
          This is a hell of a time to be 
          draggin' up old business.

                    SAM
          People have worked this whole big 
          thing up around my father. If it's 
          built on a crime, they deserve to 
          know. Now I understand why you might 
          want to believe he couldn't do it.

                    HOLLIS
          And I understand why you might want 
          to think he could.

     This is a low blow, but accurate enough to shake Sam.

                    SAM
          Thanks for your time, Hollis.

     Hollis holds up a double handful of lures--dozens of rubber 
     and plastic worms and shiners and frogs and spinners--

                    HOLLIS
          Look at all this, would you? My 
          tackle, the boat, all to catch a 
          little old fish just minding its 
          business on the bottom of the lake.

     He gives Sam a look--

                    HOLLIS
          Hardly seems worth the effort--does 
          it, Sam? Sam walks away--

     INT. CLASSROOM -- ARMY BASE -- DAY -- CU ATHENA

     Athena stands at attention, trying to keep her composure--

                    CLIFF (O.S.)
          So you knew this young man before?

                    ATHENA
          From back in Houston. We both come 
          up on Fifth Street.

                    PRISCILLA (O.S.)
          Did you know he was going to be there 
          last night?

                    ATHENA
          If I had I wouldn't have gone in.

                    PRISCILLA (O.S.)
          And you and Private Graves--

                    ATHENA
          We were just dancing--

     WIDER

     Cliff leans against a desk, a blackboard covered with radar 
     diagrams behind him. Priscilla sits nearby, both of them 
     focused on Athena.

                    PRISCILLA
          We're not running a dating service 
          here.

                    ATHENA
          I know that, Sergeant. We were just 
          dancing. There was a bunch of us 
          there. Shadow just come down looking 
          for trouble.

                    CLIFF
          It's not our job to get involved in 
          your personal life, but when it 
          interferes with the training here--

                    ATHENA
          I'm sorry, Sergeant Major. There 
          wasn't anything I could do. Shadow 
          gets crazy--

     A silence as the sergeant lets her stew for a moment. She 
     works up her courage--

                    ATHENA
          Sergeant Major? How is Richie doing? 
          Private Graves?

                    CLIFF
          He'll live.

                    PRISCILLA
          He'll be transferred to a military 
          hospital as soon as he's stabilized--

                    CLIFF
          He'll probably be getting a medical 
          discharge--

                    ATHENA
          Out of the Army?

                    CLIFF
          He's going to lose a lung. This is 
          not good news for Athena--

                    ATHENA
          Will this go on my record?

     Cliff considers for a long moment--

                    CLIFF
          If the incident happened the way you 
          say it did, there hasn't been an 
          infraction.

                    ATHENA
          Thank you, Sergeant Major.

                    CLIFF
          You're dismissed.

                    ATHENA
          Thank you, Sergeant Major.

     Athena steps out of the room. Cliff sits on the desk--

                    PRISCILLA
          You spoil 'em, Cliff.

                    CLIFF
          Hey--she's in a tough situation. I 
          cut her some slack--

                    PRISCILLA
          But I'm the one in charge of her 
          sorry ass.

                    CLIFF
          She's pulled herself out of a pretty 
          rough neighborhood.

     Crossing to the door--

                    PRISCILLA
          And if she isn't careful she's gonna 
          slide right back into it.

     EXT. BLEDSOE HOUSE -- DAY -- ROCKER

     We start on a CU of a rocker creaking back and forth on an 
     old wooden porch. A WOMAN HUMS.

     MINNIE

     MINNIE BLEDSOE, in her 60s, sits on her porch in the old 
     Black section of town, playing with a Gameboy. She has very 
     thick glasses on. Sam walks up to her from his car--

                    SAM
          Mrs. Bledsoe?

                    MINNIE
          That's me.

                    SAM
          I'm Sheriff Deeds--

                    MINNIE
          Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just 
          Sheriff junior.

                    SAM
               (Smiles)
          Yeah, that's the story of my life.

                    MINNIE
          You ever play one of these?

                    SAM
          I've seen 'em.

                    MINNIE
          Well, don't ever start up on 'em, 
          cause once you do you can't stop. I 
          tell myself I'm gonna play just three 
          little games after breakfast, and 
          here I sit with half the day gone.

                    SAM
          You mind if I ask a few questions 
          about your husband? Roderick?

                    MINNIE
          I won't say nothing bad about the 
          man, but you can ask away.

                    SAM
          He had the club out on the old trail 
          road--

                    MINNIE
          We run that twenty-odd years. Give 
          it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.

                    SAM
          So you must remember Sheriff Wade.

                    MINNIE
          Not if I can help it.

                    SAM
          You had to deal with him in running 
          the club.

                    MINNIE
          Them days, you deal with Sheriff 
          Wade or you didn't deal at all. First 
          of the month, every month, he remind 
          you of who you really workin' for.

                    SAM
          He squeezed money out of you?

                    MINNIE
          Wasn't legal to sell liquor in a 
          glass back then unless you was a 
          club, see. Roderick used to say, 
          "Buy yourself a drink, you get a 
          free membership." But Sheriff Wade, 
          he could shut you down anytime.

                    SAM
          And my father?

                    MINNIE
          Sheriff Buddy was a different story. 
          Long as Roderick throw his weight 
          the right way on election day, make 
          sure all the colored get out to vote-
          we was called colored back then, if 
          you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue 
          for the right people now and then, 
          things was peaceful. That Sheriff 
          Wade, though, he took an awful big 
          bite.

                    SAM
          People didn't complain?

                    MINNIE
          Not if they was colored or Meskin. 
          Not if they wanted to keep breathin'.

                    SAM
          Do you remember the last time you 
          saw him?

     Minnie thinks, puts down the Gameboy--

                    MINNIE
          I seen him in our place the last 
          week before he gone missin'.

     We TRACK in to a close-up of her. R&B MUSIC FADES UP slowly--

                    MINNIE
          He used to come in whilst we was in 
          full swing, make people nervous. Had 
          him a smile like the Grim Reaper--

                               DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. ROADHOUSE --

     The joint is crowded, people drinking, talking, laughing, a 
     few dancing, all trying to avoid locking eyes with Sheriff 
     Wade, who sits with his legs stretched out at a table.

     Young Hollis sits by him, smiling uncomfortably. Sax-wailing 
     R&B blasts from the jukebox. YOUNG OTIS, a slick, confident 
     character with straightened hair and a silk shirt on, in his 
     early 20s, stops to talk with a MAN on his way to bring a 
     tray with a couple beers and glasses over.

                    MINNIE (V.O.)
          --just sit back with his hand on 
          that big ol' gun and act the kingfish 
          with everybody. Otis Payne had come 
          to work for us by then, and that boy 
          had him some attitude--

     CU WADE

     Watching Young Otis with narrowed eyes--

     CU WADE'S POV -- OTIS

     A man puts a slip of paper in Otis's pocket, pats his back. 
     Otis winks to acknowledge the bet, turns, makes eyes at a 
     PRETTY WOMAN sitting at the bar, who is eyeing him back.  He 
     lays the beers and glasses on the table, starts away.

                    WADE
          Pour it.

     OTIS TURNS, CUPS HIS HAND AROUND HIS EAR-

                    WADE
          Pour it.

     Expressionless, he starts to pour the beer into Wade's glass. 
     The Sheriff looks up into his face--

                    WADE
          I know you?

                    YOUNG OTIS
          Name's Otis.

                    WADE
          Otis what?

                    YOUNG OTIS
          Payne.

                    WADE
          One of Cleroe Payne's boys?

                    YOUNG OTIS
          Uh-huh.

                    WADE
          I sent your Daddy to the farm once.

                    YOUNG OTIS
          I know that.

                    WADE
          Why you think that was?

     Otis feels people watching.  He doesn't want to lose face--

                    YOUNG OTIS
          Some crop needed pickin' and the man 
          was shorthanded.

     A very insolent answer for the time and place--

                    WADE
          As I remember it was because he had 
          a sassy mouth on him. Must run in 
          the family--You wouldn't be runnin' 
          numbers out of this club, now, would 
          you, son?

                    YOUNG OTIS
          Runnin' numbers illegal.

                    WADE
          Runnin' numbers without I know about 
          it is both illegal and unhealthy. 
          You remember that.

     The beer is poured. Otis starts away--

                    WADE
          Whoah, son. You're not finished. 
          Pour his.

                    YOUNG HOLLIS
          I prefer it in the bottle--

                    WADE
          Shut up, Hollis. Pour.

     Otis meets Wade's look now, pours the other beer--

                    WADE
          How come you don't took familiar?

                    YOUNG OTIS
          Been away. Up to Houston.

                    WADE
          Houston, huh? I hear they let you 
          boys run wild up there.

     No response. Wade deliberately pushes the glass away so beer 
     splashes on the table and drips into Hollis's lap--

                    WADE
          Aw--look what you done now. Better 
          get something to wipe it up, son.

     Half the people in the room are watching now, the other half 
     moving away to relative safety. Otis tries to keep a lid on 
     his temper, looks around the room--

                    YOUNG OTIS
          You spilt it, you wipe it up.

     Wade stands, steely-eyed, and looks at Otis nose to nose--

                    WADE
          I told you to do something. Are you 
          gonna hop to it, or are we gonna 
          have a problem?

     Otis is starting to shake, but holds his ground--

                    WADE
          Don't want to turn tail in front of 
          your people. I understand.

     He starts to turn away then WHAP! brings the butt of his 
     pistol up under Otis's chin, knocking him to the floor. A 
     woman SCREAMS and Otis, enraged, grabs the chair he has fallen 
     over, starts to get up--but Wade has the pistol levelled at 
     his face--

                    WADE
          Come on, Houston, give it a try! 
          Come to Poppa--

     RODERICK is out on the floor now, hands held out in a gesture 
     of peace, as YOUNG MINNIE watches from behind the bar, 
     petrified--

                    RODERICK
          Don't mind him, Sheriff. Boy's just 
          a bit slow, is all. He don't mean 
          nothin' by it--

                    WADE
          That the problem, son?  You Slow?

                    RODERICK
          Otis, apologize to the Sheriff--

     Otis eases the chair down but doesn't say anything--

                    RODERICK
          You got him too scared to peep, 
          Sheriff. Maybe if you put that gun 
          up--

                    WADE
          You telling me what to do, Roderick?

                    RODERICK
          No, Sheriff, I'm just--

     Wade looks around, widens his eyes in mock surprise--

                    WADE
          What's this I see? Is that whiskey 
          in them glasses on the Bar? Roderick, 
          I'm gonna have to cite you for a 
          violation of state law--

                    RODERICK
          This is a club, Sheriff--you been in 
          here--

                    WADE
          And people better clear out of here! 
          Now!

     A few people start for the exit.  Wade swivels and BLAM sends 
     a bullet past Minnie that shatters a crystal decanter behind 
     the bar.  People run for the door. Wade squats down to look 
     Otis in the face--

     CU WADE

                    WADE
          You learn how to act your place, 
          son. This idn't Houston.

     He stands and we FOLLOW him toward the bar--

                    OTIS (V.O.)
          'Course I was young and full of beans 
          then--

     The camera passes Wade and instead of Minnie there stands 
     Otis, PRESENT DAY, reminiscing. We are back in '95--

                    OTIS
          I didn't understand the spot I was 
          putting Roderick in.

                    SAM
          And that was the last time you saw 
          him?

     We SHIFT to see Sam sitting where Wade was headed--

                    OTIS
          Oh--I think he came in one more time 
          with Hollis and--naw, your Daddy 
          wasn't with them. Made their monthly 
          pickup. Roderick wasn't in so I just 
          kept my mouth good and shut and handed 
          over that envelope.

                    SAM
          That was the night he disappeared?

                    OTIS
               (Shakes his head)
          Could of been. That was white people's 
          business.

                    SAM
          And when my father was Sheriff?

                    OTIS
          What about it?

                    SAM
          What was your deal with him?

     Otis smiles, chooses his words carefully--

                    OTIS
          Buddy was more a part of the big 
          picture--county political machine,  
          chamber of commerce, zoning board if 
          I kept those people happy, he was 
          pretty much on my side.
               (Smiles)
          Whenever somebody thought--they start 
          up another bar for the black  folks, 
          they'd be--how should I put this? 
          They'd be officially discouraged.

                    SAM
          He ever accept cash for a favor?

     Otis smiles, looks away to ponder his response--

                    OTIS
          I don't recall a prisoner ever died 
          in your father's custody. I don't 
          recall a man in this town--Black, 
          White, Mexican--who'd hesitate a 
          minute before they'd call on Buddy 
          Deeds to solve a problem. More than 
          that I wouldn't like to say.

     INT. CAR -- LATE AFTERNOON

     Pilar drives Amado and her daughter Paloma home--

                    AMADO
          If you had your way I wouldn't have 
          any friends.

                    PILAR
          Oh, come on, Amado--

                    AMADO
          Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss 
          Honor Roll here--

                    PILAR
          Leave your sister out of it.

                    AMADO
          You and all of the teachers in this 
          dump--your story's over, so you don't 
          want anybody else to have fun.

     We see on PILAR's face that he has scored--

                    PALOMA
          You jerk--

                    AMADO
          I'm not talking to you. You don't 
          have any friends.

     PILAR eases the car down San Jacinto street, seeing something 
     on the street and she's tuning her kids' conversation out--

                    PALOMA
          Who'd want to be friends with that 
          bunch of pachuco wannabes?

                    AMADO
          I don't pretend I came over on the 
          Mayflower--

                    PALOMA
          And those stupid girls who hang out 
          with them--

                    AMADO
          Just shut up.

     PILAR'S POV -- SAM

     Sam walks on the sidewalk parallel to them, talking with 
     three other MEN--

                    PALOMA (O.S.)
          Joanie Orozco's telling the whole 
          school she's like desperately in 
          love with Santo Guerra.

                    AMADO (O.S.)
          So?

                    PALOMA (O.S.)
          It's pathetic. You can't be 
          desperately in love when you're 14 
          years old.

     INT. PILAR'S CAR

     Pilar is still looking fixedly out the window--

                    PALOMA
          Not if you have half a brain in your 
          head.

                    PILAR
          Of course you can.

                    PALOMA
          What?

                    PILAR
          It doesn't have anything to do with 
          being smart.

     EXT. SAN JACINTO STREET -- LATE AFTERNOON

     Danny Padilla is arguing with H.L. BRIGGS, a construction 
     company big shot, and JORGE GUERRA, a Council member in his 
     40s and Sam, as they walk down the sidewalk of the main street--

                    JORGE
          What I'm saying is, I don't see the 
          point. You had your chance when the 
          dedication committee was meeting--

                    DANNY
          I've got new information--

                    H.L.
          It's ancient goddarn history, Danny--

                    DANNY
          1963, they dam up the north branch 
          to make Lake Pescadero. A whole little 
          town disappears--

                    H.L.
          Squatter town--

                    DANNY
          People had been living in Perdido 
          for over a hundred years. Mexicans 
          and Chicanos are deported, evicted, 
          moved forcibly out of their houses 
          by our local hero, Buddy Deeds, and 
          his department--

                    JORGE
          There was a bill from the state 
          legislature--

                    DANNY
          Families were split apart, a whole 
          community was destroyed--

                    H.L.
          They were trespassing, Danny--

                    DANNY
          --and who ends up with lakefront 
          property bought for a fraction of 
          the market price? Buddy Deeds, Sheriff 
          of Rio County, and his Chief Deputy, 
          Hollis Pogue.

     They all look at Sam, who has been listening patiently the 
     whole while.  They've reached his office.

                    SAM
          You finished?

                    DANNY
          Look, I'm not after you, Sam.  I 
          just think people in town ought to 
          know the full story on Buddy Deeds.

                    SAM
               (Nods)
          That makes two of us.

     Sam steps into his office, leaving H.L. shaking his head--

                    H.L.
          You best be thankful that's the son 
          and not the father. Buddy woulda 
          kicked your ass from here to sundown.

     INT. HALLWAY -- DEL'S HOUSE -- LATE AFTERNOON

     We TRACK down a hallway as Celie walks toward us, calling 
     ahead. Chet stands in the middle of the hall behind her.

                    CELIE (O.S.)
          I don't see what the big deal is. Go 
          back over, talk to the man, and bury 
          the hatchet, Del--

     CELIE passes us and Del crosses back in the other direction 
     from behind the camera, carrying boxes of their belongings. 
     We continue our SLOW TRACK forward--

                    DEL
          Otis Payne was never embarrassed 
          about a thing in his life.

                    CHET
          Dad--

                    CELIE (O.S.)
          You were 8 years old when he left--

                    DEL
          He didn't leave, he moved three houses 
          down with one of my mother's best 
          friends.

                    CHET
          Dad--?

                    DEL
          "Hey, Delmore, where's your Daddy?"

     Del disappears into the bedroom at the end of the hall--

                    DEL (O.S.)
          Everybody else's business. And 
          everybody loved Big O--

     DEL comes back out, empty-handed--

                    DEL
          Big O was always there with a  smile 
          or a loan or a free drink.

                    CHET
          Dad, can I talk to you about track?

                    CELIE (O.S.)
          People change.

                    DEL
          Not that much.

                    CHET
          Dad, I talked to the track coach--

                    DEL
          I thought we already had this out?  
          Next year, if your grades are high 
          enough--

                    CHET
          I have a B average.

                    DEL
          How many B-average students do you 
          think they take at West Point?

                    CELIE (O.S.)
          We're going to have to see him.

                    DEL
          No, we don't.

     Del steps away past us, leaving Chet, defeated--

     INT. CAFE -- NIGHT -- ENRIQUE

     We start on Enrique, talking surreptitiously on the pay phone 
     on the way to the kitchen.

                    ENRIQUE
          Sabado por la noche--Is, es el  mas 
          seguero--a cruzar por la  manana y 
          pues tendremos que esperar--[Friday 
          night--Yes, that's the safest--I'll 
          cross in the morning and then we'll 
          have to wait--]

     Mercedes bustles by, snapping her fingers--

                    MERCEDES
          Off the phone, by we've got people 
          waiting. Andale!

     We FOLLOW Mercedes back into the kitchen, where she moves 
     through, kibbitzing the operation--

     WAITRESS

     Mercedes stops by a young girl prepping a pork loin to be 
     cooked. She isn't wearing gloves.

                    MERCEDES
          Donde estan sus guantes? Tonta! Quiere 
          matar a mis clientes? [Where are 
          your gloves? Stupid! You want to 
          kill my customers?]

     She continues past, shaking her bead, bringing us to Pilar, 
     who is trying to stay out of the way--

                    MERCEDES
          These ones coming up are getting 
          stupider every year.

                    PILAR
          Maybe you're just getting less 
          patient.

                    MERCEDES
          If they're going to survive here, 
          they have to know how to work, Elalco! 
          Adelante! Los clientes esperan!

                    PILAR
          Well, you hire illegals--

                    MERCEDES
               (Indignant)
          Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've 
          got green cards, they've got relatives 
          who were born here--if they only had 
          a little common sense I'd be very 
          happy.

                    PILAR
          If you spent a little more time 
          training them--

                    MERCEDES
          Did you come here to tell me how to 
          run my business?

                    PILAR
          No. I was wondering if you'd like to 
          take a trip down south with us. Maybe 
          see where you grew up--

                    MERCEDES
          Why would I want to go there?

                    PILAR
          Oh, come on--you must be curious how 
          it's changed. Amado is into this big 
          Tejano roots thing and I've never 
          been further than Ciudad Leon--

                    MERCEDES
          You want to see Mexicans, open your 
          eyes and look around you. We're up 
          to our ears in them.

     Pilar gives up on the trip. She watches her mother poking at 
     the plates of chips and salsa ready to go out--

                    PILAR
          Mami, how old were you when my father--

                    MERCEDES
          He was killed.

                    PILAR
          Right. When he was killed.

                    MERCEDES
          A little older than Paloma is now.

                    PILAR
          How come you never got married again?

     Mercedes just glares at her--

                    PILAR
          There must have been somebody.

                    MERCEDES
               (Mutters)
          I was too busy.

                    PILAR
          Nobody's too busy.

                    MERCEDES
          Maybe now. It was different back 
          then. I had this place, I was doing 
          all the shopping, all the cooking. 
          What do I need some chulo with grease 
          under his nails to drink up the 
          profit?

                    PILAR
               (Pissed off)
          Thank you.

                    MERCEDES
          I don't mean Fernando.

                    PILAR
          Mami, the first time I brought him 
          home, those were your exact words-- 
          "some chulo with grease under his 
          nails."

                    MERCEDES
          I never said that.

                    PILAR
          You made it pretty damn clear you 
          thought he was nobody.

                    MERCEDES
          I felt that you could do better for 
          yourself--

                    PILAR
          What? Become a nun? You didn't want 
          me going out with Anglos--

                    MERCEDES
          I never said that. It was just that 
          boy--

                    PILAR
          "That boy"--Mami, say his name for 
          chrissakes!

     The employees are staring. Mercedes won't look at her daughter 
     as she steps out of the kitchen, banging into Enrique on his 
     way back in--

                    MERCEDES
          You people are stealing my money-- 
          Entiende? Robandome?

     Mercedes is gone. The young girl, pulling plastic gloves on, 
     looks to Pilar.

                    GIRL
          Su madre? [Your mother?]

                    PILAR
          Si.

     The girl puts her hand on her heart in sympathy--

                    GIRL
          Lo siento [My condolences.]

     INT. COUNTRY AND WESTERN BAR -- NIGHT

     A crowded room, C&W MUSIC plays on the box. Sam sits behind 
     a bottle of beer as the bartender, CODY, in his early 50s 
     philosophizes.

                    CODY
          Now I'm just as liberal as the next 
          guy--

                    SAM
          If the next guy's a redneck.

                    CODY
          --but I gotta say I think there's  
          something to this cold climate  
          business. I mean, you go to the beach-
          what do you do? Drink a few beers, 
          wait for a fish to flop up on the 
          sand. Can't build no civilization 
          that way. You got a hard winter 
          coming, though, you got to plan ahead, 
          and that gives your cerebral cortex 
          a workout.

                    SAM
          Good deal you were born down here, 
          then.

                    CODY
          You joke about it, Sam, but we are 
          in a state of crisis. The lines of 
          demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run 
          a sucessfull civilization you got to 
          have lines of demarcation between 
          right and wrong, between this one 
          and that one--your Daddy understood 
          that. He was like the whatchacallit--
          the referee for this damn menudo we 
          got down here. He understood how 
          most people don't want their sugar 
          and salt in the same jar.

                    SAM
          You mixed drinks bad as you mix 
          metaphors, you be out of a job.

                    CODY
          Take that pair over in the corner--

     Sam swivels to look where Cody points--

                    CODY
          Place like this, twenty years ago, 
          Buddy woulda been, on them two--

     SAM'S POV -- CORNER BOOTH

     Cliff and Priscilla talk across a table--

                    CODY (O.S.)
          --warning. Not 'cause he had it in 
          for the colored

     SAM AND CODY

                    CODY
          --but just as a kind of safety tip.

                    SAM
          Yeah. I bet he would.

                    CODY
          Old Sam stood for somethin', you 
          know? The day that man died they 
          broke the goddamn mold.

     BOOTH -- CLIFF AND PRISCILLA

     Things are obviously more than professional between these 
     two--

                    PRISCILLA
          So where does that put us?

                    CLIFF
          Well--I don't see what's changed. No -
          PDA's, no necking on the obstacle 
          course.

                    PRISCILLA
          Seriously.

                    CLIFF
          Seriously, I think we should get 
          married.

                    PRISCILLA
          We been through this before--

                    CLIFF
          We should just do it.

                    PRISCILLA
          And if I get a shot at a promotion 
          somewhere--

                    CLIFF
          You could take it--

                    PRISCILLA
          It's up or out these days, Cliff. 
          Say I get transferred to a different 
          post--

                    CLIFF
          I'd quit the Army for you, if it 
          came to that.

                    PRISCILLA
               (Grins)
          Man's gonna retire in two years and 
          he offer to quit. Big goddamn deal.

                    SAM (O.S.)
          Excuse me--

     They look up to see Sam standing over them--

                    CLIFF
          Sheriff--hi--this is Sergeant--this 
          is Priscilla Worth.

                    SAM
          Pleased to meet you.

                    CLIFF
          Sheriff Deeds was in on our 
          archeological find yesterday.

                    PRISCILLA
          It true they gonna build a shopping 
          mall out there?

                    SAM
          If certain people have their way, 
          it's going to be a new jail.

                    PRISCILLA
          Damn. Maybe we got in the wrong 
          business. They closin' down military 
          bases left and right, puttin' up 
          jails like 7-11 stores.

                    SAM
          Do either of you have any idea when 
          they stopped using that site as a 
          rifle range?

                    CLIFF
          They stopped training infantry there 
          in the late '50s. It was just a 
          playground for the jackrabbits till 
          they gave it to the county last year.

                    PRISCILLA
          You know who it was they dug up?

                    SAM
          Not for sure yet. But I kind of wish 
          they hadn't.

     EXT. CAFE -- NIGHT

     Enrique steps out of the darkened cafe, followed by Mercedes, 
     who locks up. Mercedes steps over to an expensive-looking 
     car--

                    ENRIQUE
          Es muy lindo, su coche--

                    MERCEDES
          En ingles Enrique. This is the United 
          States. We speak English.

                    ENRIQUE
          Is very beautiful, your car.

                    MERCEDES
          Good night, Enrique. She slides into 
          the car--

                    ENRIQUE
          Buenas noches, Senora Cruz. Enrique 
          walks in the opposite direction--

                                   FADE OUT

     EXT. BIG O'S ROADHOUSE -- DAY -- CU DEL

     Del, in uniform, approaches the front door of Big O's, not 
     open for business yet. We TIGHTEN as he stops to read a 
     handlettered sign next to it: "BLACK SEMINOLE EXHIBIT REAR 
     ENTRANCE." He steps in--

     INT. ROADHOUSE

     Late-50s R&B plays on the JUKEBOX. Otis stands behind the 
     counter hooking the beer taps up. Del steps in and sits on a 
     stool at the far end of the bar, tense, looking around the 
     place. When Otis sees him, he stops dead. They lock eyes for 
     a moment, then Otis turns to call.

                    OTIS
          Carolyn--knock that off for a minute.

     CAROLYN

     CAROLYN SYKES, an attractive woman maybe ten years younger 
     than Otis, pulls the plug from the jukebox near where she's 
     scrubbing bloodstains off the floor. She turns to look at 
     the newcomer--

     BAR

     Del doesn't move to come closer--

                    DEL
          Black Seminoles?

                    OTIS
               (Shrugs)
          Hobby of mine. Got some artifacts, 
          couple pieces one of your men out at 
          the base made. Free admission.

     Del nods toward where Carolyn is mopping--

                    DEL
          That where he was shot?

                    OTIS
          That's where he fell.

                    DEL
          You get much of that in here?

                    OTIS
          It's a bar. People come together, 
          drink, fall in love, fall out of 
          love, air their grudges out--

                    DEL
          Deal drugs in the bathroom--

                    OTIS
          If I thought it would help I'd put 
          up a sign telling them not to. Right 
          under the one about the employees 
          washing their hands.

     Carolyn has come over by Otis, lugging the bucket and mop--

                    OTIS
          This here's Carolyn. Honey, this is 
          my son, Delmore.

                    DEL
          Nice to meet you, Ma'am.

     Carolyn nods, shoots a look to Otis--

                    CAROLYN
          I'll be in back waiting for that 
          delivery.

     They wail till she is gone to start again--

                    OTIS
          So.

                    DEL
          So tell me why I shouldn't make this 
          place off-limits.

                    OTIS
          This is an official visit, then--

                    DEL
          I assume a lot of your business is 
          from our people.

     Otis pulls a tap back and it coughs before squirting beer.

                    OTIS
          Your boys out there cooped up 
          together, need somewhere they can 
          let the steam out. If they're Black, 
          there's not but one place in this 
          town they feel welcome. Been that 
          way since before you were born.

                    DEL
          We have an enlisted man's club at 
          the post.

                    OTIS
          Well, you're the Man out there now, 
          aren't you? It's your call.

                    DEL
          That's right.

                    OTIS
               (Smiles)
          I been hearing rumors about this new 
          commander coming for a couple weeks 
          now. Boys say they heard he's a real 
          hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full-
          bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- 
          Bet you never figured you end up 
          back here.

                    DEL
          The Army hands you a command, you go 
          wherever it is.

                    OTIS
          Right.

                    DEL
          I hear things, too.  People call  
          you the Mayor of Darktown.

                    OTIS
               (Shrugs)
          Over the years, this is the one place 
          that's always been there. I loan a 
          little money out, settle some 
          arguments. Got a cot in the back- 
          people get afraid to go home they 
          can spend the night. There's not 
          enough of us to run anything in this 
          town- the white people are mostly 
          out on the lake now and the Mexicans 
          hire each other. There's the Holiness 
          Church and there's Big O's place.

                    DEL
          And people make their choice--

                    OTIS
               (Smiles)
          A lot of 'em choose both. There's 
          not like a borderline between the 
          good people and the bad people--you're 
          not either on one side or the other--

     Del looks away, not wanting to believe this--

                    OTIS
               (Softly)
          I gonna meet that family of yours?

                    DEL
          Why would you want to do that?

                    OTIS
          Because I'm your father.

     Del gives him a dark look and lets the statement hang between 
     them. He gets up and heads for the door--

                    DEL
          You'll get official notification 
          when I make my decision. He is out 
          the door--Otis pulls himself a beer 
          as Carolyn steps back out--

                    CAROLYN
          So that's him--

                    OTIS
          Yeah--that's him. Got two, three 
          thousand people under him out there, 
          you count the civilians.

                    CAROLYN
          That must be a laugh a minute.

     EXT. SAN JACINTO STREET -- DAY

     Sam walks down the main street of town. A CROWD is gathering 
     at the other end for the ceremony--

                    H.L. (O.S.)
          Sheriff!

     We WIDEN as H.L. and Jorge catch up to him. H.L. slaps Sam 
     on the back--

                    H.L.
          Historic occasion, isn't it?

                    SAM
          Seems like we have another one every 
          week.

                    H.L.
          Jorge and his Chamber of Commerce 
          boys got to keep things hummin'--

                    JORGE
          We're building up tourism, Sam--

                    SAM
          People come here to catch bass and 
          to get laid at the Boy's Town in 
          Cuidad Leon--

                    JORGE
          Sam--

                    SAM
          You ought to put up a banner--
          "Frontera, Texas: Gateway to Cut-
          Rate Pussy"--

                    H.L.
          That kind of talk doesn't help, Sam.

                    SAM
          Rather have that than the ten-foot-
          high catfish statue--

                    JORGE
          I got Eddie Richter at the Sentinel 
          to kill that story.

                    SAM
          The Perdido thing?

                    JORGE
          He agreed it wasn't exactly news--

                    SAM
          Danny's gonna be out for blood the 
          next time.

                    H.L.
          Which is why we need to talk to you 
          about the new jail--just so we're 
          all on the same page.

                    SAM
          We don't need a new jail.

                    H.L.
          That's a matter of interpretation--

                    SAM
          We're already renting cells to the 
          Feds for their overflow--

                    JORGE
          There was a mandate in the last 
          election--

                    SAM
          It wouldn't happen to be your 
          construction company gonna get the 
          bid on building this thing, would 
          it, H.L. And Jorge, you wouldn't be 
          thinking about a couple dozen new 
          jobs to dangle in front of the voters--

                    H.L.
          Dammit, Sam, the people are concerned 
          about crime--

                    SAM
          We need a drug rehab program, we 
          need a new elementary school--

                    JORGE
          There isn't money allocated for that. 
          But a jail--

                    SAM
          Look, I'm not gonna campaign against 
          your deal here, but if anybody asks 
          me, I got to tell them the truth. We--
          don't--need--a new jail.

                    H.L.
          When we backed you--

                    SAM
          When you backed me you needed  
          somebody named Deeds to bump the  
          other fella out of office.  Hey,  
          folks--

     Sam and the others smile as they reach the CROWD of 
     townspeople, mostly small business owners and retired people. 
     Photographers from the paper and a local TV news crew wait 
     by a veiled Statue roped off in a little traffic island. 
     Mercedes, dressed to kill, stands waiting next to Hollis 
     with a huge pair of scissors in her hand.

     CU MERCEDES

     Slowly working the blades of the scissors, she looks coldly 
     at Sam--

     CU SAM

     He nods to her as the crowd opens a path for him.

                    SAM
          Let's get this thing over with.

     INT. MIKEY'S WORKSHOP -- MORNING

     We start on a two-foot-high statue of a cowboy made from old 
     bullets and shell casings. We PAN past a few others, the 
     poses lifted from Frederic Remington paintings, till we see 
     Mikey, gluing together a work in progress, a Remington book 
     propped open in front of him. Cliff sits at the worktable 
     playing absently with the old bullets spilled out from MIKEY'S 
     bag

                    MIKEY
          Never thought I'd see the day a buddy 
          of mine was dating a woman with three 
          up and three down on her shoulder.

                    CLIFF
          I think it's beyond what you'd call 
          dating.

                    MIKEY
          You going to get married?

                    CLIFF
               (Shrugs)
          Maybe.

                    MIKEY
          You met her family? They gonna be 
          cool about you being a white guy?

                    CLIFF
          Priscilla says they think any woman 
          over 30 who isn't married must be a 
          lesbian. She figures they'll be so 
          relieved I'm a man--

                    MIKEY
          Always heartwarming to see a prejudice 
          defeated by a deeper prejudice.  But 
          marriage, man--I did two tours in 
          Southeast Asia and I was married for 
          five years--I couldn't tell you which 
          experience was worse.

     Cliff picks up a slug--

                    CLIFF
          Hey, Mikey--

                    MIKEY
          I knew she was Japanese going into 
          it, but she didn't tell me the ninja 
          assassin part--

                    CLIFF
          Mikey--

                    MIKEY
          Her parents acted like I was gonna 
          blow my nose on their curtains--

                    CLIFF
          Mikey--

                    MIKEY
          If I stayed out past ten with the 
          guys she'd go into her Madame 
          Butterfly routine--

                    CLIFF
          Mikey look at this--

                    MIKEY
          What--it's a bullet. I'm lousy with 
          bullets here.

                    CLIFF
          It's a .45.

                    MIKEY
          Yeah?

                    CLIFF
          This is the stuff we picked up the 
          other day, right? The rest of this 
          is all .30 caliber--

                    MIKEY
          They were using M-1's, yeah--

                    CLIFF
          What's it doing on a rifle range?

     MIKEY holds the slug in front of his face--

                    MIKEY
          We better call that Sheriff.

     EXT. SAN JACINTO STREET -- DAY

     Hollis is finishing his oration, having put the crowd in a 
     good mood.

                    HOLLIS
          Sometime in the early '70s a reporter 
          from a national magazine was talking 
          to the governor of our Lone Star 
          state, and he asked him, "Governor, 
          what's your ideal of what a real 
          Texan ought to be?" Governor said, 
          "That's easy, son- you just go down 
          to Rio County and get a look at 
          Sheriff Buddy Deeds."

     Applause--

     SAM

     Watching the crowd--

     SAM'S POV

     We PAN with his gaze across smiling faces, till he comes to 
     Danny and a couple of Chicano friends, looking grim. We RACK 
     FOCUS beyond them to see Pilar, watching the ceremony from a 
     few yards back--

                    HOLLIS (O.S.)
          Thank you. We've got one more person 
          to hear from--

     HOLLIS

                    HOLLIS
          --and he's somebody who probably 
          knew Buddy better than any of us, 
          Sam--would you say a few words?

     SAM

     Not thrilled to be called on. He steps forward reluctantly 
     to APPLAUSE--

                    SAM
          You folks who remember my father 
          knew him as Sheriff. But at home he 
          was also judge, jury

     He looks to Hollis--

                    SAM
          --and executioner.

     LAUGHTER. Sam holds Hollis's eyes for a moment before 
     continuing--

                    SAM
          This is a real honor you're doing 
          him today, and if Buddy was around 
          I'm sure his hat size would be gettin' 
          bigger every minute.

     PILAR

     Watching--

                    SAM (O.S.)
          I used to come to this park to hide 
          from him. Now that you're putting 
          his name on it--

     SAM

                    SAM
          I'll have to find someplace new to 
          duck out.

     More LAUGHTER--

                    SAM
          I do appreciate it, and wherever he 
          is, Buddy's puttin' the beer on ice 
          for the bunch of you. Thank you.

     APPLAUSE--

     Sam steps back and Mercedes steps forward with her scissors 
     without looking at him--

                    HOLLIS
          And now my fellow Council member and 
          one of Frontera's most respected 
          businesswomen, Mrs. Mercedes Cruz, 
          will do the honors for us.

     MERCEDES

     She freezes, smiling, till the still photographers have gotten 
     their shots, then snips the cord to a pulley system that 
     lets the cloth drop--

     STATUE

     The cloth drops to reveal a bas-relief in brass set in a 
     block of smooth limestone.  A decent likeness of Buddy in 
     uniform, his hand on the shoulder of a small Chicano-looking 
     boy who stands beside him, eyes raised worshipfully.

     APPLAUSE from the gathering--

     SAM

     Watching, a bit removed, as Mercedes shakes hands with Jorge 
     and H.L. and Hollis for the cameras. He overhears a pair of 
     BYSTANDERS who are checking out the statue--

                    BYSTANDER 1 (O.S.)
          It does look like old Buddy.

                    BYSTANDER 2 (O.S.)
          Runnin that kid in for loiterin'--

     The bystanders LAUGH--Sam steps away, intercepting Mercedes 
     as she steps away--

                    SAM
          Nice to see you, Mrs. Cruz.

     Mercedes just looks at him, keeps going. His gaze brings him 
     to Pilar, standing on the sidewalk, watching.

     SAM

     Steps over from the dispersing crowd--

                    SAM
          Field trip?

                    PILAR
          Lunch hour. My next class isn't till 
          nine-thirty.

                    SAM
          Want to take a walk?

     EXT. RIVERSIDE -- DAY

     Sam and PILAR walk together alongside the Rio--

                    SAM
          Your mother still doesn't like me.

                    PILAR
          I can't name anybody she does like 
          these days.

                    SAM
          I see she built a place up here by 
          the river.

                    PILAR
          A real palace. She rattles around 
          alone in that thing--

                    SAM
          She's done well for herself--on her 
          own and all--

                    PILAR
          So she tells me three times a week.

     She looks at him--

                    PILAR
          I thought you got through that pretty 
          well.

                    SAM
          They cooked the whole thing up without 
          asking me.

                    PILAR
          People liked him.

                    SAM
          Most people did, yeah.

                    PILAR
          I remember him watching me once. 
          When I was little--before you and I--

     She shrugs.

                    PILAR
          I was on the playground with all the 
          other kids, but I thought he was 
          only looking at me. I was afraid he 
          was going to arrest me--he had those 
          eyes, you know--

                    SAM
          Yeah.

                    PILAR
          Weird what you remember.

     They walk in silence a moment--

                    SAM
          Your boy, there--

                    PILAR
          Amado.

                    SAM
          Nice-looking kid.

                    PILAR
          He hates me.

                    SAM
          No--

                    PILAR
          With Paloma, it's more like she pities 
          and tolerates me- totally age-
          appropriate. But Amado--he's--he's 
          never been book-smart. Had a hard 
          time learning to read. Me being a 
          teacher and caring about those things 
          is like an embarrassment--like a 
          betrayal.

                    SAM
          Fernando did okay, and he dropped 
          out--

                    PILAR
          Fernando wasn't pissed off at 
          everybody. He just wanted to fix 
          their cars.

                    SAM
          It might just be the age. I spent my 
          first fifteen years trying to be 
          just like Buddy and the next fifteen 
          trying to give him a heart attack.

     She looks at him--

                    PILAR
          So why did you come back here, Sam?

                    SAM
          Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work 
          for my father-in-law anymore. The 
          fellas down here said they'd back me--

                    PILAR
          You don't want to be Sheriff.

                    SAM
          I got to admit it's not what I thought 
          it'd be. Back When Buddy had it--
          hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60-
          room hotel with bars on the windows.

                    PILAR
          It can happen so sudden, can't it? 
          Being left out on your own.

                    SAM
          You've got your mother, your kids--

                    PILAR
          They've got me. Different thing.

     They stop at a spot where you can climb down the bank--

                    SAM
          Remember this?

     Pilar looks at the spot. She isn't ready to deal with whatever 
     memory it brings back--

                    PILAR
          I should get back.

                    SAM
          Pilar--

                    PILAR
          Looks real bad if the teacher's late 
          for class. It's really nice to talk 
          with you, Sam.

     She waves and walks away, feeling awkward. Sam watches for a 
     minute, then turns and steps down to the bank, He looks at 
     the water.

     RIVER SURFACE

     A little piece of tree bark is tossed onto the water and 
     drifts away with the current. We TILT UP to see YOUNG PILAR 
     tossing bark into the river as YOUNG SAM sits on the bank 
     beside her. They are 14 and 15 years old--It is 1972--

                    YOUNG SAM
          You going to tell her?

                    YOUNG PILAR
          You going to tell him?

                    YOUNG SAM
          He doesn't need to know all my 
          business.

                    YOUNG PILAR
          He's gonna find out.

                    YOUNG SAM
          So? What's he gonna do, arrest us?

     Young Pilar frowns, tosses more bark--

                    YOUNG PILAR
          It's supposed to be some big sin, 
          even if you love each other.

                    YOUNG SAM
          You believe that?

     CU YOUNG PILAR

     She turns to look at him--

                    YOUNG PILAR
          No.

     We PAN with her gaze to see Sam, PRESENT DAY, sitting on the 
     bank, lost in thought--

                    SAM
          Me neither.

     EXT. ARMY POST -- DAY

     Athena walking between buildings, looking a bit out of it. 
     Sergeant Worth cuts into her--

                    PRISCILLA
          Private Johnson!

                    ATHENA
          Sergeant?

                    PRISCILLA
          Report to Dr. Innis at the clinic.

                    ATHENA
          I'm feeling okay--

                    PRISCILLA
          I'm very happy to hear that, Private. 
          Now you go put some pee-pee in a cup 
          for Dr. Innis and I'll be feeling 
          okay, too.

                    ATHENA
               (Reacts)
          You're testing me?

                    PRISCILLA
          You and one hundred nineteen other 
          fortunate individuals. Put it in 
          gear.

                    ATHENA
          Yes, Sergeant.

     Sergeant Worth watches Athena go, suspicious--

     INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON

     Ray Hernandez and another DEPUTY guide Shadow back in from 
     the courthouse in handcuffs--

                    RAY
          Excellent performance, my friend. 
          The judge was very impressed.

                    SHADOW
          You don't need to cuff me.

                    RAY
          You been talking so much trash today, 
          you made us think you're a dangerous 
          criminal. Be a good boy, now--

     They guide him past Sam's desk--

                    SHADOW
          You're the one who's a good boy. Man 
          say "fetch" and you fetch--

                    RAY
          Just doing my job.

                    SHADOW
          White man just using you to keep the 
          Black man down.

                    RAY
          This isn't Houston, my friend. We 
          pretty much running things now. Our 
          good day has come.

                    SHADOW
          You suckers haven't had a good day 
          since the Alamo.

     Ray smiles, pushes him out--

                    RAY
          Andale, amigo,

     We HOLD on Sam at his desk, TIGHTENING as he holds the .45 
     slug from the sergeants in front of his eyes--

                    SAM
          Lupe? Get me the rangers up in Austin--

     INT. MERCEDES' KITCHEN -- NIGHT -- CU GLASS

     We hear old MEXICAN MUSIC. Ice cubes plunk into a glass.

     WIDER, MERCEDES

     Mercedes, exhausted from a day at the cafe, pours herself a 
     Scotch and soda--

     EXT. BACK PATIO -- NIGHT

     The back LIGHT is flicked on and Mercedes steps out with her 
     drink in hand, the MUSIC audible from inside. She sinks into 
     a recliner. We TIGHTEN as she closes her eyes. Something 
     RUSTLES out In the dark. Mercedes opens her eyes. There is 
     WHISPERING. Mercedes sits up and suddenly two MEN run past 
     the edge of the patio toward the front of the house. Mercedes 
     sighs--

                    MERCEDES
          Otra vez los mojados--[Wetbacks  
          again--]

     Mercedes searches to find a portable phone on the patio table, 
     punches a number in--

                    MERCEDES
          Hello? Border Patrol?

     EXT. SAM'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

     Sam, out of uniform, stands behind his little house chucking 
     fallen pecans out into the dark, thinking, listening to the 
     night sounds.

     CU SAM

     Working something out in his head. He looks off into the 
     dark and we PAN with his gaze--A MAN steps toward us, barely 
     visible in the darkness. It is Charley Wade--We're in Sam's 
     REVERIE, in 1957--

                    WADE
          Who is that? Come out here where I 
          can see you!

     BLAM! A GUNSHOT, and Wade falls to his knees--

                    WADE
          You sonofabitch--

     Wade falls on his face. A FLASHLIGHT BEAM flicks ON and plays 
     over his body. We PAN back along the be to see Buddy, 
     holstering his Pistol. He hears something, swings the 
     flashlight up.

     SAM

     We are back in 1995. Sam is blasted in the face with a 
     FLASHLIGHT BEAM--

                    PATROLMAN (O.S.)
          Hold it right there! Brazos  arriba! 
          Sam, squinting toward the light to 
          see who it is, raises his hands over 
          his head--

                    ZACK (O.S.)
          Get that thing off 'im! He's one of 
          ours--

                    SAM
          Zack?

     The FLASHLIGHT BEAM PANS AWAY and ZACK POLLARD, a Border 
     Patrol agent, steps out of the dark to Sam--

                    ZACK
          Hey Sam. Sorry 'bout that.

                    SAM
          What's up?

                    ZACK
          We had about a dozen wets come over 
          just upriver. They ran into one of 
          our posts--it was like a breakshot 
          on a pool table, illegals runnin' 
          every which way.

                    SAM
          I haven't seen anybody come by.

                    ZACK
          We'll get 'em--
               (Looks around)
          So you livin' out here now?

                    SAM
          Yeah. It's quiet--

                    ZACK
          I heard about that deal for your 
          father--You must be real proud.

                    SAM
          Sure.

                    ZACK
          The stories people tell, he was a 
          real colorful fella--

                    PATROLMAN (O.S.)
          Zack! We got one!

                    ZACK
          Well--back on the clock. You see any 
          of our neighbors from the south, let 
          'em know I'm lookin' for 'em.

                    SAM
          'Night--

     Zack steps away.  Sam shakes the pecans still in his band, 
     goes back to chucking them--

     EXT. COURTYARD -- DANCERS

     Older CHICANO COUPLES dance to Mexican Music playing from 
     speakers set up in the apartment complex courtyard.  We TILT 
     UP to see Enrique watching from his window--

     INT. APARTMENT -- NIGHT

     MUSIC still blasting.  Enrique steps away from the window, 
     and sits on the bed of his drab furnished apartment. He goes 
     back to tying knots in a length of clothesline splicing it 
     to another. On the bed beside him are new flashlights and 
     the batteries, still in their packaging. He begins to coil 
     the rope--it is hundreds of feet long.

     EXT. FRONT PORCH, PILAR'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

     Pilar sits on her front Porch, listening to the MUSIC in the 
     distance. A woman singing a MEXICAN LOVE BALLAD. After a 
     while we hear Paloma open the screen door behind her--

                    PALOMA (O.S.)
          Mom?

                    PILAR
          Yeah?

                    PALOMA (O.S.)
          You gonna stay out here?

                    PILAR
          For a while.

     A silence. They listen to the RECORD--

                    PALOMA (O.S.)
          What's she singing about?

                    PILAR
               (Smiles)
          What do you think?

                                   FADE OUT

     INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE -- EARLY MORNING

     Sam has been up since dawn, searching through piles of old 
     department records. Papers cover his desk and the chairs 
     he's dragged over next to it. He reads out loud himself from 
     a report in front of him--

                    SAM
          First bullet entered beneath the 
          left eye, severing the optical nerve 
          and exiting from top rear of skull 
          causing tissue damage

     DOCUMENTS -- VARIOUS SHOTS

     As Sam reads, we see quick pops of various records-- 
     Certificates of death. An old Sheriff's Department payroll. 
     An autopsy report. Eviction notices.

                    SAM (O.S.)
          --and severe cerebral hemorrhaging. 
          Second bullet entered left cheek  
          driving fragment of upper and lower 
          molars into base of skull. Third 
          bullet--

     Real estate transfers. A map of the Proposed Lake Pescadero. 
     Another autopsy report. A FAX COPY of the forensics dental 
     report on Charley Wade. Another autopsy report--

     CU SAM

     Intent as he pores over the paperwork--

     Garcia killed by Shf Wade--3/49 Hollis Kinney hired by Shf

     We come to Sam's hand, writing, when it clears we can read 
     the last entry--

     Mercedes Cruz hired as cook, Rio Co. jail--4/57 ?????

     CU SAM

     Trying to put it all together.

     PETE ZAYAS, a skinny, older man in trustee's coveralls, 
     wanders in, emptying the trash baskets in the front office--

                    PETE
          Morning, Sheriff.

                    SAM
          Hey, Pete. How's it going?

                    PETE
          Time marches on.

                    SAM
          How much you got left?

                    PETE
          Three months.

                    SAM
          You stop growing that loco weed at 
          your place, you'd see a lot more 
          daylight.

                    PETE
          It was for personal consumption.

                    SAM
          You're going to smoke an acre and a 
          half of marijuana?

                    PETE
          I got a bad stomach. It helps me 
          digest.

     Pete dumps out the basket by Sam--

                    PETE
          Your father never bothered me about 
          it. Leastways not till the drug people 
          got on his back in the late '60s.

                    SAM
          I thought he busted you a couple 
          times.

                    PETE
          Different charge. I had a still. 
          Made my own mescal.

     Sam looks up at him.

                    PETE
          That's how I ruined my stomach.

                    SAM
               (Smiles)
          I'm surprised he bothered with it.

                    PETE
          He was afraid I was going to poison 
          somebody. Your father tried to do 
          good for people--

                    SAM
          So I've heard--

                    PETE
          And your mother was a saint. That 
          summer I built the patio at your 
          house? She made me lunch every day.

                    SAM
          Well, you were working there--

                    PETE
          It could have just been a box lunch 
          from the jail.

     Sam looks up again, troubled.

                    SAM
          You built our patio while you  were 
          on the county?

                    PETE
          Out in the fresh air, nice gringo 
          lady making you pies--who's gonna 
          sit back in a little jail cell all 
          day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no 
          hay dos. And after that cabron Charley 
          Wade--

                    SAM
          I've heard Wade was a bit tough on 
          the Mexicans--

                    PETE
          He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough 
          enough for you?

                    SAM
          Murdered him?

                    PETE
          Chucho Montoya saw it with his own 
          eyes. Shot him in cold blood.

     EXT. SAN JACINTO STREET -- MORNING

     Ray Hernandez, heading in to work, comes upon Sam getting 
     into his car--

                    RAY
          You're out early.

                    SAM
          Yeah.

                    RAY
          Haven't seen much of you at the jail 
          lately.

                    SAM
          I been working on a few things.

                    RAY
          Uh-huh.

                    SAM
          I'm going over to the other side.

                    RAY
               (Concerned)
          The Republicans?

                    SAM
          No--to Mexico. I've got to talk to 
          somebody.

                    RAY
          They got telephones.

                    SAM
          Gotta be in person.

                    RAY
          Oh.

     An awkward silence. Sam sits into the driver's seal and Ray 
     leans down to talk--

                    RAY
          Sam? I--the Committee--you know Jorge 
          and H.L. and all--they asked me--

                    SAM
          They want you to stand for Sheriff 
          next election.

                    RAY
          Yeah.

                    SAM
          You'd do a good job.

                    RAY
          How 'bout you?

                    SAM
          Don't know if I'll still want it.

                    RAY
          I didn't want to be going around 
          your back.

                    SAM
          I appreciate you telling me.

     Sam looks at his Chief Deputy--

                    SAM
          You think we need a new jail?

                    RAY
          Well, it's a complicated issue--

     Sam smiles, turns the engine on--

                    SAM
          Yeah, Ray, you'd be a hell of a 
          Sheriff.

     EXT. SCHOOL -- MORNING

     Pilar sits with Amado on the football field bleachers before 
     school starts--

                    PILAR
          I'm only going to have you for two 
          more years. If you decide not to go 
          on to college--

                    AMADO
          I can't take any more school.

                    PILAR
          --you're going to be on your own.

                    AMADO
          So?

                    PILAR
          So I'm worried about you. I don't 
          want you to end up in jail like your 
          friends.

                    AMADO
          They're not going to jail.

                    PILAR
          Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew 
          how they got all those things.

                    AMADO
          Just some rich Anglo out on the lake. 
          Don't even live here all year.

                    PILAR
          That makes it okay?

                    AMADO
          They stole our land--

                    PILAR
          Save your breath. That line doesn't 
          cut it with me.

     A silence. Amado sulks.

                    PILAR
          How do you think you're going to 
          make a living?

                    AMADO
          I can fix cars.

                    PILAR
          You can fix old cars. Mr. Washburn 
          told me that the cars they're making 
          now are all computerized--

                    AMADO
          You think I can't learn that?

                    PILAR
          I think you can learn whatever you 
          want to. I just don't see you doing 
          it. If you want to settle for--

                    AMADO
          I'm not settling for anything. I 
          like cars, it's just not a move up 
          the ladder to you, so you think it's 
          a waste.

                    PILAR
          That isn't true.

                    AMADO
          Oh, come on--you and Grandma think 
          anybody who works with their hands 
          is a peasant. When Dad--

                    PILAR
          If you grew up to he anywhere near 
          as good a man as your father was, I 
          would be happy! I would be thrilled.

     They look, at each other for a long moment.

                    AMADO
          It's my life. If I want to fuck it 
          up, that's my business.

                    PILAR
               (Nods)
          I said pretty much the same thing to 
          my mother when I was your age.

                    AMADO
          And what did she do?

                    PILAR
          Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of 
          Perpetual Help.

                    AMADO
          Catholic school, nasty.

     Pilar is nearly in tears.

                    PILAR
          Honey, I think you're smart and you're 
          good and I love you. So don't act 
          like an idiot, all right?

     EXT. BORDER CROSSING -- DAY

     We see Sam's car roll through the "express lane" as other 
     cars in both directions stop by the inspection booths. Sam 
     drives across the bridge over the Rio--

     EXT. STREETS -- CIUDAD LEON -- VARIOUS SHOTS

     Sam drives slowly through the sprawling, more populous town 
     on the other side.  Lots of the streets are unpaved.  We PAN 
     with the car till we HOLD on ANSELMA, a country girl of 15, 
     aimlessly walking the streets--

     EXT. LLANTERIA (TIRE REPAIR SHOP) -- DAY

     We watch a KID about Amado's age pulling a tire off its rim 
     to put a patch on it--

                    CHUCHO (O.S.)
          Over here we don't throw everything 
          away like you gringos do.

     CHUCHO AND SAM

     CHUCHO MONTOYA, in his mid-50s, stands by Sam drinking a 
     Coke as they watch the kid work.

                    CHUCHO
          Recycling, right? We invented that. 
          The government doesn't have to tell 
          people to do it.

                    SAM
          You own this place?

                    CHUCHO
          This place, the one across the street, 
          four other ones around Ciudad Leon-- 
          soy el Rey de las Llantas. King of 
          the Tires. Lots of your people rollin' 
          back over that bridge on my rubber.

                    SAM
               (Nods)
          You lived in the States for a while?

                    CHUCHO
          Fifteen years in El Paso.

                    SAM
          Made some money, came back here--

                    CHUCHO
          Something like that.

                    SAM
          You ever know a fella named Eladio 
          Cruz?

     CHUCHO smiles, draws a line in the dirt with his heel--

                    CHUCHO
          You the sheriff of Rio County, right? 
          Un jefe muy respetado. Step over 
          this line.

     Sam obliges--

                    CHUCHO
          Ay, que milagro! You're not the 
          Sheriff of nothing anymore- just 
          some tejano with a lot of questions 
          I don't have to answer.

     Sam smiles, plays with the line with his toe--

                    CHUCHO
          Bird flying south-you think he sees 
          that line? Rattlesnake, javelina--
          whatever you got--halfway across 
          that line they don't start thinking 
          different. So why should a man?

                    SAM
          Your government always been pretty 
          happy to have that line. The 
          question's just been where to draw 
          it

     CU CHUCHO

                    CHUCHO
          My government can go fuck itself, 
          and so can yours. I'm talking about 
          people here--men. Mi amigo Eladio 
          Cruz is giving some friends of his a 
          lift in his camion one day--

     We PAN from CHUCHO to the FLAT TIRE on a battered old pickup 
     truck--

                    CHUCHO (V.O.)
          --but because he's on one side of 
          this invisible line and not the other, 
          they got to hide in the back like 
          criminals--

     Eladio CRUZ, young and good-looking, squats into the shot to 
     examine the tire, jack in hand. It Is 1956--

                    CHUCHO (V.O.)
          And because over there he's just 
          another Mex bracero, any man with a 
          badge is his jefe--

     CONJUNTO MUSIC comes from the truck RADIO. YOUNG CHUCHO steps 
     past Eladio--

                    ELADIO
          Donde vas, Chucho, Tienes que quedar 
          escondido! [Shit, CHUCHO you got to 
          stay hidden!]

                    YOUNG CHUCHO
          Voy a romper las rinones si no hago 
          pipi--[I'm gonna bust my kidneys if 
          I don't pee--]

     We TRACK back with Young CHUCHO to see we are at the side of 
     a dirt road on the scrubby flatland near the border. Eladio's 
     battered pickup truck has wood-slat sides and a canvas top. 
     Eladio begins to undo the nuts on the flat tire as Young 
     CHUCHO climbs down into a dry creek bed to relieve himself--

                    YOUNG CHUCHO
          Los demas son tan espantados que 
          prefieran mojar sus pantalones. [The 
          other guys are so scared they'd rather 
          wet their pants.]

     CHUCHO tightens as he sees something, ducks down--

                    YOUNG CHUCHO
          Mira, Eladio [Look!]

     We PAN to see the Sheriff's car approaching in a cloud of 
     DUST--

                    ELADIO
               (Calling from where 
               he lies changing the 
               tire)
          Muchachos! Escondases! [Boys! Hide 
          yourselves!]

     INT. REAR OF TRUCK

     Eight illegal WORKERS hear this and lie down, pulling a canvas 
     tarp over themselves. We hear the CAR STOP behind them--

     EXT. ARROYO -- CU CHUCHO

     He makes the sign of the cross as he presses his back against 
     the dirt of the arroyo--

     ROAD

     Sheriff Wade and Deputy Hollis get out of their car and start 
     toward Eladio--

     ELADIO

     He stands, takes a deep breath--Wade steps up to him with 
     his hard-eyed smile--

                    WADE
          Hola, amgio. Problemas de llanta? 
          [Hey, friend. Tire problems?]

                    ELADIO
          No hay de que. Tengo otra. [No  
          problem, I've got another.]

                    WADE
          What's in the back?

     EXT. TRUCK

     Young Hollis strolls around the truck as if he's considering 
     buying it.  He reaches in and flicks the RADIO OFF--

                    ELADIO
          Not much, jefe. Some watermelons.

                    WADE
          I heard somebody been haulin' wets 
          on this road.

                    ELADIO
          I haven't seen anybody doing that.

                    WADE
          This same person been bragging all 
          over the county how he don't have to 
          cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it--
          he can run his own operation 'thout 
          any help. Como se llama, amigo?

                    ELADIO
          Eladio Cruz.

                    WADE
          You know this road got a bad 
          reputation, Eladio--

     ARROYO -- CHUCHO

     Young CHUCHO pecks over the edge to see what's happening.

                    ELADIO
          Reputation?

                    WADE
          Bandidos, Injuns--

     CLOSER -- MEN

     Hollis wanders over to stand by Wade--

                    WADE
          There's many an unfortunate soul 
          been ambushed out on this stretch. 
          Hope you're carrying some protection.

                    ELADIO
          Protection?

                    WADE
          You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't 
          lie to me now.

                    ELADIO
          Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--

                    WADE
          Just a shotgun, huh? Better let me 
          take a look at that.

     ELADIO opens the truck door and digs under the seat. Wade 
     winks to Hollis, then turns and BLAM! shoots ELADIO through 
     the head. Hollis jumps back startled and horrified--

                    YOUNG HOLLIS
          Oh no--oh Jesus--oh my Lord--

                    WADE
          Little greaser sonofabitch been 
          running a goddarn bus service. Think 
          he can make a fool out of Charley 
          Wade! Get them wets outta the back, 
          Hollis, see what we've got--

     CU CHUCHO

     Squatting in a ball to make himself as small as possible, 
     eyes covered with his hands.

                    YOUNG HOLLIS (O.S.)
          You killed him--

                    WADE (O.S.)
          You got a talent for statin' the 
          obvious, son Muchachos! Venga 
          afuera!Brazos arribas! [Come on out! 
          Hands up!]

     Young CHUCHO hears FOOTSTEPS approaching. We PAN as he looks-- 
     a man's BOOTS appear at the top of the arroyo. We TILT UP to 
     see a Sheriff, BACKLIT, then CRANE to see it is Sam, back in 
     the PRESENT looking over the site, troubled. His car sits on 
     the empty road behind him. He frowns, turns to go--

     EXT. PARK -- DAY -- PLAQUE

     Somebody has spray-painted "PERDIDO!" over the plaque of 
     Buddy and the little boy--

                    HOLLIS (O.S.)
          Hooligans--

     WIDER

     Hollis and a couple of MEN from the Public Work Department 
     look at the damage.

                    HOLLIS
          It happens again, we build a fence 
          around it.

     INT. CAFE -- DAY

     Enrique steels himself, trying to cover his nerves. We CROSS 
     with him to a booth.

                    ZACK
          Podemos ganar muchas batallas pero 
          la guerra ya es perdido--[We can win 
          a lot of battles but the war's already 
          been lost--]

     Zack and another BORDER PATROLMAN look up at him--

     CU ENRIQUE

     Eyes glued to his notepad--

                    ENRIQUE
          You wan' something to drink?

     EXT. ROADSIDE STAND -- DAY -- CU CATTLE SKULL

     A Georgia O'Keefe-looking cattle skull sits on a pedestal 
     against the Western sky--

                    WESLEY (O.S.)
          The longhorns go for ten times the 
          price--

     We WIDEN as the skull is lifted by WESLEY BIRDSONG, a Native 
     American man in his 70s who wears extremely thick glasses. 
     Sam tags along as the old man rearranges the display of Texas 
     curios laid out in front of his trailer. Empty scrubland 
     surrounds them.

                    WESLEY
          --but longhorns are hard to come by 
          these days.

                    SAM
          You sell much out here?

                    WESLEY
          How am I gonna sell things if nobody 
          comes by? This stretch of road runs 
          between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.

                    SAM
          Hell of a spot to put a business.

                    WESLEY
          But you don't see much competition, 
          do you?

     He winks at Sam, picks up a wooden radio carved to resemble 
     the Alamo--

                    WESLEY
          These things used to sell like 
          hotcakes. Now, if it can't play those 
          discs, they won't look at it.

     He puts the radio on, looks out at the emptiness around--

                    WESLEY
          I like it here. Once I tried going 
          onto that reservation to live. 
          Couldn't take the politics. Damn 
          Indian'll drive you crazy with that, 
          Now your father--this wasn't what he 
          had in mind at all. He come out of 
          Korea, he had this Chevy with too 
          much engine in it. He'd come roarin' 
          up and down this road all hours of 
          the day and night,looking for somebody 
          to race.

     He lifts a jar with a leathery brown thing in it--

                    WESLEY
          Buffalo chips. Fella in Santa Fe 
          told me he sells these as fast as 
          the buffalo can squeeze 'em out.

                    SAM
          So when did Buddy leave?

                    WESLEY
          For Frontera? Hell, I can't remember 
          dates no more. I do recall it was 
          after an affair of the heart had 
          gone sour on him. He almost took 
          some poor fella's head off at the 
          Legion in Arroyo Grande, and figured 
          it was time to move on.

                    SAM
          You think he killed anybody in Korea?

                    WESLEY
          They don't hand those medals out for 
          hidin'in your foxhole. Would you buy 
          this?

                    SAM
          No--

                    WESLEY
          Me neither.

     He searches for something among the curios--

                    WESLEY
          If he hadn't found that Deputy job, 
          I believe Buddy might've gone down 
          the other path, got into some serious 
          trouble. Settled him right down. 
          That and your mother. 'Course he had 
          that other one later.

                    SAM
          Another woman?

                    WESLEY
          Your mother wasn't one to get chased 
          off her patch. Half the damn county 
          knew and nobody thought the worse of 
          her for seein' it through.

                    SAM
          You know who it was?

                    WESLEY
          The other one? Hell, at my age, every 
          time you learn a new name you got to 
          forget an old one. Your head's all 
          crowded up--here it is--

     Wesley stretches out a four-foot rattlesnake skin, rattles 
     still attached--

                    WESLEY
          This big fella was sleepin' in a 
          crate at Cisco's junkyard right when 
          I looked to see what was in it. Jumped 
          up at my face--scared me so bad I 
          killed him without thinkin'.

     He shakes the rattles at Sam--

                    WESLEY
          Gotta be careful where you're pokin'--
          who knows what you'll find.

     INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY -- DAY

     PILAR talks with Molly as they near the administration office--

                    PILAR
          I don't think you can take it 
          personally--

                    MOLLY
          I'd like to see them spend a day 
          pulling 14-year-olds off of each 
          other--I should get combat pay--

                    PILAR
          I have new respect for some of my 
          kids, meeting the parents they've  
          been dealt--

     Molly keeps going as Pilar ducks into the office--

                    PILAR
          See you, Molly.

     INT. OFFICE

     PILAR crosses past the principal's secretary, MARISOL--

                    MARISOL
          Steve called for you.

                    PILAR
          Steve?

                    MARISOL
          Steve. Board of Education Steve who 
          likes you? He goes for us hot-blooded 
          Mexican girls, I can tell.

                    PILAR
          Spanish, please. My mother would 
          have a heart attack.

                    MARISOL
          Your mother's family is Spanish?

                    PILAR
          Sure, they go back to Cortez. When 
          he rode by, they were squatting in a 
          hut cooking hamsters for dinner.

                    MARISOL
          You got to be interested in somebody. 
          All you do is work.

                    PILAR
          All my mother does is work. That's 
          how you get to be Spanish.

                    MARISOL
          How 'bout the Sheriff?

                    PILAR
          The Sheriff.

                    MARISOL
          The old-high-school-heartthrob 
          Sheriff. I thought you were crazy 
          about each other. He's available, 
          you're available--

                    PILAR
          I'm unmarried. I'm not available.

                    MARISOL
          You told me one time it was true 
          love.

     PILAR takes the pile of mimeos and mail from her slot and 
     turns to go--

                    PILAR
               (Mutters)
          Nobody stays in love for twenty-three 
          years.

     EXT. DRIVE-IN MOVIE -- NIGHT

     It is 1972. An early-'70s cheezy action picture (Filipino 
     women-in-chains or biker flick is playing. We TILT DOWN to a 
     man's BOOTS crunching across the gravel of the parking area. 
     Now and then, the man turns a FLASHLIGHT BEAM on a license 
     plate. The cars are all pre-'72, lots of pickups, and the 
     patrons are almost all TEENAGERS. Some have turned their 
     pickups around to sit on the tailgate and watch, while others 
     have set lawn furniture out to sit on. We TILT UP slightly 
     to see the glint of a Rio County Sheriff's badge pinned on 
     the man's shirt. He meets a DEPUTY coming in the other 
     direction. Both train their FLASHLIGHTS on the license of 
     the car we see in the b.g. between them.  We TILT and RACK 
     to see that nobody is visible through the window--

                    BUDDY (O.S.)
          Let's go.

     We FOLLOW Buddy up to the driver's side of the car as the 
     Deputy goes to the passenger side. We PAN with Buddy's hand 
     down to the door handle--he grabs it, flings it open--the 
     overhead LIGHT flicks ON and there lie YOUNG SAM and PILAR, 
     teenagers, half their clothes off and just about to close 
     the deal. PILAR SCREAMS and the Deputy throws the door open 
     by their heads--

                    BUDDY
          Goddammit!

     Buddy grabs Sam's ankles and yanks him out of the car onto 
     the ground as the Deputy awkwardly pulls PILAR, out the other 
     side--

                    YOUNG SAM
          What the hell are you doing? You 
          fucking asshole!

                    BUDDY
          How old is that girl? Goddammit, 
          where's your goddam sense?

                    YOUNG PILAR (O.S.)
          Let me go!  Pendejo!

                    YOUNG HOLLIS (O.S.)
          Come on now, Missy, get your clothes 
          in order--

     Sam is trying to kick and punch at his father, pausing in 
     between to pull his pants up. People are BOOING and HONKING 
     their HORNS all around--

                    YOUNG SAM
          You got no fuckin' right! You stay 
          out of my fuckin' life!

                    BUDDY
          Gimme the keys--gimme the goddamn 
          car keys, son--

                    YOUNG HOLLIS (O.S.)
          What am I s'posed to do with her, 
          Buddy?

                    BUDDY
          You drive her home and tell her mother 
          where we found her--

                    YOUNG PILAR (O.S.)
          Sam!

     The kids are dragged forward into the HEADLIGHTS that are 
     being turned on to see what the ruckus is. Both are crying, 
     struggling--

                    YOUNG SAM
          You leave her the fuck alone!

                    BUDDY
          You just shut that filthy mouth, 
          son. I'll deal with you when we get 
          home--

                    YOUNG PILAR
          Please, don't tell my mother! She's 
          gonna kill me!

     They step closer into the glaring HEADLIGHTS which WHITE OUT 
     the scene, then FADE.

     EXT. RUINED DRIVE-IN -- DUSK

     It is DUSK, PRESENT DAY. Our eyes readjust to see Sam, 
     standing by his car in the lot of the long-abandoned drive-
     in. The ruined screen rises in the b.g.

     CU SAM

     Remembering. MUSIC BEGINS as he gets back into the car, pulls 
     away.

     MARQUEE -- DUSK

     MUSIC CONTINUES as the car cruises out past the old marquee, 
     a few letters still jumbled on it, several bullet holes around 
     them.

     INT. CAR

     MUSIC CONTINUES as Sam drives, thinking--

     EXT. ROADS -- VARIOUS SHOTS -- DUSK/NIGHT

     MUSIC CONTINUES as the car crosses the scrubland back toward 
     town. DUSK turns to NIGHT--

     EXT. PILAR'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

     MUSIC CONTINUES as Sam cruises past Pilar's house. The car 
     is not in the driveway: Paloma hangs out with a couple FRIENDS 
     under the porch light, laughing--

     EXT. HIGH SCHOOL -- NIGHT

     MUSIC CONTINUES as Sam's car pulls into the high school lot. 
     He looks up toward the school--

     EXT. WINDOW, PILAR, -- SAM'S POV

     MUSIC CONTINUES. We can see PILAR, through the lighted window 
     of her classroom, preparing something on the blackboard--

     INT. CAR

     MUSIC ENDS as Sam leans back to wait--

     EXT. PARKING LOT

     PILAR digs in her bag for her car keys as she makes her way 
     across the lot. She sees something, slows, reacting, then 
     brings us to Sam in his car. He has parked head-to-foot next 
     to hers. They look at each other for a long moment

                    PILAR
               (Softly)
          Follow me.

     EXT. MAIN STREET -- NIGHT

     Nothing stirring. Pilar's car appears, closely followed by 
     Sam's. The cafe has closed for the night.

     INT. CAFE -- NIGHT

     Sam and Pilar sit on chairs next to each other, facing the 
     window, talking softly. The STREETLIGHT shining through the 
     letters in the front window makes patterns on their faces

                    PILAR
          We thought we were something, didn't 
          we?

                    SAM
          Yeah.

                    PILAR
          I look at my kids in school--tenth, 
          eleventh graders. That's who we were. 
          Children.

                    SAM
          Yeah.

                    PILAR
          I mean what did we know about 
          anything?

                    SAM
          Nothing.

     Pilar looks at him--

                    PILAR
          When Nando died--it was so sudden--I 
          was kind of in shock for awhile.   
          Then I woke up and there was the 
          whole rest of my life and I didn't 
          have any idea what to do with it.

                    SAM
          You know the other day, you asked 
          why I came back?

                    PILAR
          Yeah?

                    SAM
          I came back 'cause you were here.

     PILAR nods. She gets up and we FOLLOW her across the dark 
     room to the jukebox. She looks at the selections--

                    PILAR
          My mother hasn't changed the songs 
          since I was 10.

     She puts in a quarter, punches some numbers. A Mexican BALLAD 
     comes on. She crosses back to Sam, holds her hand out. He 
     stands to greet her. They slow-dance in the empty cafe--

     INT. SAM'S APARTMENT -- BEDROOM

     Sam and Pilar finish making love. They lie beside each other, 
     shaking a little--

                    PILAR
          Wow.

                    SAM
          Yeah.

                    PILAR
          How come it feels the same?

                    SAM
          I don't know. It just feels good. 
          Always did.

                    PILAR
          So what are we gonna do about this?

                    SAM
          More, I hope.

     PILAR smiles, looks around the room--

                    PILAR
          How long have you lived here?

                    SAM
          Two years.

                    PILAR
          There's nothing on the walls. No 
          pictures--

                    SAM
          Don't have kids. Other pictures--I 
          don't know--it's nothing I want to 
          look back on.

                    PILAR
          Like your story is over.

                    SAM
          I've felt that way, yeah.

     Sbe puts her head on his cbest--

                    PILAR
          It isn't. Not by a long shot. He 
          holds her and they lie silently for 
          a moment--

                    SAM
          Pilar--

                    PILAR
          Yeah?

                    SAM
          What was your father's name?

                    PILAR
          Eladio. Eladio. Cruz.

                                    FADE OUT:

     EXT. PILAR'S HOUSE -- MORNING

     Paloma sits on the top step of the porch, reading teen 
     magazines. PILAR steps out behind her, dressed casually, and 
     squints at the day--

                    PALOMA
          She finally got in--

                    PILAR
          It's Saturday.

                    PALOMA
          You got in late last night.

                    PILAR
          Yeah. I had uhm--school business.

     Paloma gives her a look, then holds a fashion page up for 
     her to see--

                    PALOMA
          Can I get this?

                    PILAR
          Nobody really wears that stuff, 
          Paloma.

                    PALOMA
          I could name five girls at school 
          who have one just like it--

                    PILAR
          Enough with the clothes--

                    PALOMA
          Just 'cause you went to Catholic 
          school and wore a uniform.

                    PILAR
          I only went for my last two years.

                    PALOMA
          How come?

                    PILAR
          Oh, my mother wanted to keep me away 
          from away from boys.

     PILAR steps out into the sun--

                    PALOMA
          Did it work?

     INT. CAFE -- MORNING

     Hollis is sitting alone in a booth, working on some heuvos 
     rancheros.  Sam slides in across from him--

                    SAM
          Morning, Hollis.

                    HOLLIS
          Sam! Quite a do the other day. It 
          meant a lot to folks that you said 
          something.

                    SAM
          You thought any more about our murder?

                    HOLLIS
          We have a murder?

                    SAM
          Charley Wade.

                    HOLLIS
          I wish I could tell you I remembered 
          something new, but I can't.

                    SAM
          I got an idea what happened.

                    HOLLIS
          Do you?

                    SAM
          I think somewhere between Roderick 
          Bledsoe's club and his house, Wade 
          ran into Buddy Deeds. I think Buddy 
          put a bullet in him, waited for him 
          to die, threw him in the trunk of 
          the Sheriff's car and drove him out 
          by the Army post, I think he buried 
          him under four feet of sand and never 
          looked back.

     Hollis sits back to look Sam in the eye--

                    HOLLIS
          You lived in the man's house what--
          seventeen, eighteen years? And you 
          didn't get to know him any better 
          than that?

                    SAM
          I got to go see somebody in San 
          Antonio today. Your memory gets any 
          better, I'll be back tonight.

     Sam stands and walks away. We HOLD on Hollis, his appetite 
     gone--

     EXT. BIG O'S -- MORNING

     Chet steps around to the side entrance--

     INT. BLACK SEMINOLE EXHIBIT -- DAY -- CU STATUE

     We start on a statue of a BUFFALO SOLDIER made from spent 
     bullets and shell casings, then PAN to another, then WIDEN 
     to see Chet as he pokes his head in, the BELL of the door 
     ringing.  He steps in cautiously, looking around the room. 
     On the walls there are photo-blowups, some artifacts, 
     handlettered information on cardboard. Chet stops to look up 
     at a picture of a barechested Black man with a couple of 
     feathers stuck in his headband

                    OTIS (O.S.)
          That's John Horse.

     Chet turns to see Otis standing back by, the door from the 
     bar--

                    OTIS
          Spanish in Florida called him Juan 
          Caballo. John Horse.

                    CHET
               (Looks at picture)
          He a Black man or an Indian?

                    OTIS
               (Steps in)
          Both.

     Otis crosses to the poker table, begins to clean up--

                    OTIS
          He was part of the Seminole Nation, 
          got pushed down into the Everglades  
          in pioneer days. African people who 
          run off from the slaveholders hooked 
          up with them, married up, had 
          children. When the Spanish give up 
          Florida, the U.S.Army come down to 
          move all them Indian peoples off to 
          Oklahoma--

                    CHET
          The Trail of Tears.

                    OTIS
               (Smiles)
          They teaching that now?  Good. Only 
          a couple of 'em held out--this man, 
          John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, 
          and a fella name of Osceola. Army 
          put all of them in prison and Osceola 
          died, but them other two escaped and 
          put together a fighting band and 
          held out another ten, fifteen years. 
          Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops 
          at Lake Okeechobee.

                    CHET
          So they stayed in Florida?

                    OTIS
          They got tired of fighting, went to 
          the Indian Territories for a while. 
          But the slave-raiders were on 'em 
          even there, and one night they packed 
          up and nearly the whole band rode 
          down to Mexico. Crossed at Eagle 
          Pass.

     They move on to some photos of very African-looking people 
     dressed in beautiful Seminole clothing--

                    OTIS
          Men worked for Santa Anna down there, 
          waited out the Civil War. The land 
          wasn't much to feed people on, so in 
          1870 they come north and put up at 
          Fort Duncan and the men joined up 
          what was called the Seminole Negro 
          Indian Scouts. Best trackers either 
          side of the border. Bandits, rustlers, 
          Texas rednecks, Kiowa, Comanche--

                    CHET
          They fought against the Indians?

                    OTIS
          Same as they done in Mexico.

                    CHET
          But they were Indians themselves.

                    OTIS
          They were in the Army. Like your 
          father.

                    CHET
               (Surprised)
          You know who I am?

                    OTIS
          I got a pretty good guess.

                    CHET
          That guy who got shot--

                    OTIS
          You didn't go telling your father 
          you were here?

                    CHET
          Are you kidding? And face a court-
          martial?

                    OTIS
               (Smiles)
          He's a pretty tough old man, huh?

                    CHET
          No sports if I don't keep a B average, 
          no TV on school nights, no PDA's--

                    OTIS
          PDA?

                    CHET
          Public Display of Affection. Every 
          time he moves up a rank, it's like 
          he's got to tighten the screws a 
          little more--

                    OTIS
          Well--

                    CHET
          I mean, just 'cause he didn't--you 
          know--

                    OTIS
          Didn't have a father?

                    CHET
               (Shrugs)
          He's still pissed off about it.

                    OTIS
          When you're his age you'll still be 
          pissed off about him.

     Chet nods, looks around--

                    CHET
          So how come you got into all this?

                    OTIS
          These are our people. There were 
          Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras 
          Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit--
          Congressional Medal Of Honor--

                    CHET
          So I'm part-Indian?

                    OTIS
          By blood you are. But blood only 
          means what you let it.

                    CHET
          My father says the day you're  born 
          you start from scratch, no breaks 
          and no excuses, and you got to pull 
          yourself up on your own.

                    OTIS
               (Sad)
          Well, he's living proof of that, 
          son. Living proof.

     INT. DEL'S OFFICE -- DAY

     Athena stands at attention as Del sits at his desk, reviewing 
     her record. He lets her stand for a long time before speaking--

                    DEL
          Private Johnson, are you unhappy in 
          the Army?

                    ATHENA
          No, sir--

                    DEL
          Then how would you explain the fact 
          that out of one hundred twenty people 
          we tested, you're the only one who 
          came up positive for drugs?

                    ATHENA
          I'm sorry, sir.

                    DEL
          When you were given the opportunity 
          to enlist, a kind of contract was 
          agreed upon. I think the Army has 
          honored its part of that agreement.

                    ATHENA
          Yes, sir--

                    DEL
          Do you believe in what we're doing 
          here, Private Johnson?

                    ATHENA
          I-I can do the job, sir.

                    DEL
          You don't sound too enthusiastic.

                    ATHENA
          I am, sir.

                    DEL
          What exactly do you think your job 
          is, Private?

                    ATHENA
          Follow orders. Do whatever they say.

                    DEL
          Who's "they"?

                    ATHENA
          The--the officers.

                    DEL
          And that's the job? Nothing about 
          serving your country?

     Athena is confused, hesitates to speak--

                    DEL
          These aren't trick questions, Private. 
          You'll be given an Article 15 and be 
          going into the ADCAP Program one way 
          or the other. What happens after 
          that is up to you. I'm just trying 
          to understand how somebody like you 
          thinks.

     Silence--

                    DEL
          Well?

                    ATHENA
               (Hesitant)
          You really want to know, sir?

                    DEL
          Please.

                    ATHENA
          It's their country. This is one of 
          the best deals they offer.

     Del knows he asked for it, but doesn't like the answer--

                    DEL
          How do you think I got to be a 
          colonel?

                    ATHENA
          Work hard, be good at your job. Sir. 
          Do whatever they tell you.

                    DEL
          Do whatever they tell you--

                    ATHENA
          I mean, follow orders, sir.

                    DEL
          With your attitude, Private, I'm 
          surprised you want to stay in the 
          service.

                    ATHENA
          I do, sir.

                    DEL
          Because it's a job?

                    ATHENA
               (Struggling)
          Outside it's--it's such a mess--it's--

                    DEL
          Chaos.

     Athena is sure she's overstepped her rank--

                    DEL
          Why do you think they let us in on 
          the "deal"?

                    ATHENA
          They got people to fight. Arabs, 
          yellow people, whatever. Might as 
          well use us.

                    DEL
          Do you think you've been discriminated 
          against on this post?

                    ATHENA
          No, sir. Not at all.

                    DEL
          Any serious problems with your 
          sergeant or your fellow soldiers?

                    ATHENA
          No, sir. They all been real straight 
          with me.

     Del stands, thinking, trying not to bullshit her--

                    DEL
          It works like this, Private--every 
          soldier in a war doesn't have to 
          believe in what he's fighting for.  
          Most of them fight just to back up 
          the soldiers in their squad--you try 
          not to get them killed, try not to 
          get them extra duty, try not to 
          embarrass yourself in front of them.

     He is right in her face now--

                    DEL
          Why don't you start with that?

                    ATHENA
          Yes, sir.

                    DEL
          You're dismissed, Private.

                    ATHENA
          Thank you, sir.

     Athena salutes, steps out. Del looks out the window, troubled 
     by the encounter.

     EXT. BORDER CONTROL

     A battered car full of Mexican DAY WORKERS rolls toward the 
     Mexican side checkpoint--

     INT. CAR

     Enrique sits squeezed between workers in the back. The driver 
     never stops talking as the officer waves them through.

                    DRIVER (O.S.)
          --Julia es demasiado flaca para mime 
          gusto mas mujeres con algo en frente-- 
          o muy altas como Cindy Crofor. 
          Quisiera montar esa caballa--[Julia's 
          too skinny for me--I like women with 
          something up front--or really tall 
          like Cindy Crawford. I'd like to 
          ride that horse--]

     EXT. KINCAID HOUSE -- DAY

     Sam's car is parked on the street in front of an expensive-
     looking house in a tree-lined neighborhood--

     INT. LIVING ROOM

     Sam's ex-wife, BUNNY KINCAID, shuffles across her living 
     room in slippers, crossing to turn off a big-screen TV playing 
     football highlights. Bunny wears shorts, a Houston Oilers 
     sweatshirt and a Dallas Cowboys cap. The living room is like 
     a sports museum-- signed footballs, team posters, a bookcase 
     filled with tapes of Texas pro and college football games--

                    BUNNY
          The Longhorns gonna kick some serious 
          butt this Saturday, you just watch. 
          We got a kid at tailback from down 
          your way--outta El Indio--

                    SAM (O.S.)
          That's in Maverick County.

     She brings us to Sam, sitting uncomfortably, beneath a full-
     sized blowup of Tony Dorsett hurdling a tackler--

                    BUNNY
          Oh. Right. And you're in--?

                    SAM
          Rio. BUNNY Right. This kid, Hosea 
          Brown? Does tire 40 in 3.4, soft 
          hands, lateral movement--the whole 
          package. Only a sophomore--

                    SAM
          You still going to all the home games?

                    BUNNY
          Well, Daddy's got his box at the 
          stadium, of course, and I'll fly to 
          the Cowboy away games when they're 
          in the Conference. Then there's the 
          high school on Friday' nights. West 
          Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like 
          a cat. High school, we're talkin'. 
          Guess how much he can bench-press?

                    SAM
          Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same 
          medication?

                    BUNNY
          Do I seem jumpy?

                    SAM
          No, you look good. I was just 
          wondering.

                    BUNNY
          Last year was awful rough--Mama 
          passing on and the whole business 
          with O.J.--I mean it's not like it 
          was Don Meredith or Roger Staubach 
          or one of our own boys, but it really 
          knocked me for a loop--

                    SAM
          You look good--

                    BUNNY
          --and that squeaker the Aggies dropped 
          to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in 
          some lucky shit before he kicked 
          that goal--

                    SAM
          Yeah, well--

                    BUNNY
          --they hadn't pulled me off that 
          woman I would have jerked a knot in 
          her.

                    SAM
          You were in a fight--

                    BUNNY
          Daddy calls it an "altercation." How 
          you doing, Sam? You look skinny.

                    SAM
          Same weight I always was.

                    BUNNY
          You look awful good in that uniform, 
          though.

                    SAM
          Best part of the job.

                    BUNNY
          Daddy hired a pinhead to take your 
          job. He says so himself. Says "Even 
          my son-in-law was better than this 
          pinhead I got now".

                    SAM
          Bunny, is that stuff I left in the 
          garage still there?

                    BUNNY
          Least he never called me that. With 
          me, it was always "high-strung." "My 
          Bunny might have done something with 
          her life, she wasn't so high-strung." 
          Or "tightly wound," that was another 
          one. You seeing anyone?

                    SAM
          No. You?

                    BUNNY
          Yeah. Sort of. Daddy rounds 'em up. 
          You aren't talking about money, their 
          beady little eyes go dead.

                    SAM
          You didn't--uhm--you didn't have one 
          of your fires, did you? The stuff I 
          left in the garage--some of it was 
          my father's--

                    BUNNY
          You watch the draft this year? 'Course 
          you didn't, idiot question. They try 
          to make it dramatic, like there's 
          some big surprise who picks who in 
          the first round? Only they been 
          working it over with their experts 
          and their computers for months. 
          Doctor's reports, highlight reels, 
          coaches' evaluations, psychological 
          profiles--hell, I wouldn't be 
          surprised if they collected stool 
          samples on these boys, have 'em 
          analyzed. All this stuff to pick a 
          football player for your squad. 
          Compared to that, what you know about 
          the person you get married to don't 
          amount to diddly, does it?

                    SAM
          Suppose not.

                    BUNNY
          You kind of bought yourself a pig in 
          a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that 
          time we were first seeing each other 
          you didn't know I was tightly wound--

                    SAM
          It wasn't just you, Bunny.

                    BUNNY
          No, it wasn't, was it? You didn't 
          exactly throw yourself into it heart 
          and soul, did you?

     She looks at him for an uncomfortably long moment--

                    BUNNY
          Your shit's still in the garage if 
          that's what you came for.

     Sam nods, stands. Bunny is in tears--

                    BUNNY
          350 pounds.

                    SAM
          What?

                    BUNNY
          This boy from West Side, plays tackle 
          both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. 
          You imagine having that much weight 
          on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard 
          to breathe. Hard to swallow.

                    SAM
          I think they have another fella there 
          to keep it off your chest. A spotter.

                    BUNNY
          "I only got my little girl now," he 
          says, "she's my lifeline." Then he 
          tells me I can't be in the box anymore 
          if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch 
          don't even watch the damn game, just 
          sits there drinking with his bidness 
          friends, look up at the TV now and 
          then. I do better to sit in the cheap 
          seats with some real football people.

                    SAM
               (Edging out)
          You look good, Bunny. It's nice to 
          see you.

                    BUNNY
               (Smiles)
          Thanks. I like it when you say that, 
          Sam.

     EXT. STREET -- CIUDAD LEON

     Enrique looks nervously over his shoulder before stepping 
     into a funky apartment building. We TILT up to the second 
     floor balcony, where a LITTLE BOY is watching the street--

     INT. APARTMENT

     There are eight PEOPLE not including the little boy on the 
     balcony. All are securing their possessions--rolling things 
     in blankets, filling shopping bags and grain sacks. Enrique 
     steps in--

                    ENRIQUE
          Todos estamos? [Everybody here?]

     Anselma reaches up from the floor to take his hand--

                    ANSELMA
          Van a disparar a nosotros? [Are they 
          going to shoot at us?]

                    ENRIQUE
          Nadie nos veran. Seramos invisibles. 
          Nobody's going to see us. We'll be 
          invisible.]

     INT. GARAGE -- KINCAID HOUSE -- DAY

     A mess. We start on a campaign poster with Sam's face on it 
     and the legend--"ONE GOOD DEEDS DESERVES ANOTHER--VOTE SAM 
     DEEDS FOR COUNTY SHERIFF". We PAN to see Sam, who has been 
     digging through piles of old junk, set down the box he was 
     looking for--

     CLOSER

     Sam pulls out an old holster, a sheaf of real estate and 
     insurance forms, a couple of old paperback Zane Grey westerns. 
     He pulls out a cracked leather pouch, turns it over--letters 
     fall out. He examines an envelope--no stamp or postmark--
     pulls a letter out, reads--

                    SAM
          "Dearest Buddy--"

     He puts the letter down for a moment, thinks. He needs to 
     know. He picks the letter up again, reads.

     INT. OTIS'S HOUSE -- EVENING

     Carolyn crosses the living room to answer the RING at the 
     front door.  Del stands there--

                    CAROLYN
          Hey, it's the General.

                    DEL
          Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?

                    CAROLYN
          Come on in--

                    DEL
          If it's too late--

                    CAROLYN
          Come on in.

     Del enters the house as if walking into an AMBUSH--

     INT. OTIS'S LIVING ROOM -- EVENING

     Carolyn sits back in the couch, drink in hand, checking Del 
     out--

                    CAROLYN
          Otis sittin' up with some people at 
          the club. I don't think he'll be 
          long.

     CU DEL

     Uncomfortable, sitting at the edge of an easy chair. He looks 
     at a mounted magazine photo of Otis smiling as he pours hot 
     sauce on a rack of ribs--

                    CAROLYN
          His hot sauce recipe won a contest 
          last year. They sellin' it far away 
          as San Antonio. He got a lot of 
          talent, your father.

     Del squirm a bit at the word "father"--

                    DEL
          You've been in this house for a while?

                    CAROLYN
          I been here with him eight years 
          now. He built it when he was with 
          Leora.

                    DEL
          I never met her.

                    CAROLYN
          There was a bunch of 'em You never 
          met. Me neither.

     Del looks around the living room--

                    CAROLYN
          Let me show you around--

     INT. DEN -- PHOTOGRAPH

     A blowup of a photo of a squad of Buffalo Soldiers is mounted 
     on the wall--

                    CAROLYN (O.S.)
          He got into all this cowboys and 
          Indians stuff awhile back. Spend 
          half his time pokin' around in the 
          library way up to Austin.

     CU DEL

     He looks at something below --

     DEL'S POV -- CLIPPINGS

     We PAN slowly over laminated newspaper clippings mounted 
     behind a picture of young Del in a track uniform, holding a 
     vaulting pole. The clippings are about Del making honor rolls, 
     winning a Silver Star in Vietnam, graduating from Officer 
     Candidate School, being named head of this and that in the 
     Army--

                    CAROLYN (O.S.)
          Kind of like a shrine, isn't it?

     DEL, CAROLYN

     Carolyn stands behind, watching Del's face as he looks at 
     the stuff--

                    DEL
          Where'd he get all this?

                    CAROLYN
          Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--

                    DEL
          Uncle Al--

                    CAROLYN
          Otis stood on good terms with the 
          man. Whenever you do something makes 
          the news, he sends it on. When they 
          made you General, Otis just about 
          drove away all our customers going 
          on about it.

                    DEL
          I'm a colonel.

                    CAROLYN
          Yeah, I know--Man made me memorize 
          the whole damn Army chain of command 
          before he'd marry me. So this is a 
          big deal, commander and  all?

                    DEL
          It's a small post and they're phasing 
          it out in two years, but I moved up 
          in rank and--well, a command is a 
          command.

                    CAROLYN
          Otis went on like you were that guy 
          who won the Gulf War. Colin whatsit.

                    DEL
          My mother said he never asked about--

                    CAROLYN
          He never asked her.

     It's a bit too much for Del--

                    DEL
          Listen, I uh--tell him I came by. 
          Thanks--

     We HOLD on Carolyn as he hurries out. She salutes--

                    CAROLYN
          Catch you later, Colonel.

     EXT. RIVER -- NIGHT

     PEOPLE, crouching low, wade across the river toward us. When 
     he gets close enough to us, we recognize Enrique, nervously 
     leading a group of Mexican men, women and children to the 
     U.S. side. They are spaced out in the dark, loosely holding 
     the line Enrique made in one hand and holding their bundles 
     high away from the water with the other. Enrique turns as he 
     hears a WOMAN'S CRY.  The line goes slack, then NESTOR steps 
     out of the darkness to join him--

                    ENRIQUE
          Que Paso? [What happened?]

                    NESTOR
          Anselma cayo en las rocas. Creo que 
          la pierna ha sido root--[Anselma 
          felt on the rocks. I think her leg's 
          broken--]

     Two men struggle forward supporting Anselma, trying to hold 
     her leg out straight in front of her. She is in a lot of 
     pain--

                    NESTOR
          No podemos alcanzar el camion llevando 
          a ella. Hay lugar para esconderla? 
          [We can't reach the truck if we're 
          carrying her. Is there somewhere to 
          hide her?]

     Enrique thinks, trying not to panic, as the others come up 
     around him--

                    ENRIQUE
          Conozco solamente una persona con 
          casa--[I only know one person with a 
          house--]

                    ANSELMA
               (In pain)
          Esta lejos? [Is it far?]

     EXT. PATIO -- NIGHT

     Mercedes sits on her recliner, drink in hand. An old RECORD 
     plays from inside. She is startled by the voice from the 
     dark--

                    ENRIQUE (O.S.)
          Senora Cruz?

                    MERCEDES
               (Standing)
          Quien es? [Who is it?]

                    ENRIQUE
          Soy yo, Enrique! No tiene miedo-- 
          [It's me, Enrique. Don't be afraid]

     Enrique steps out into the light. His pants are wet and he's 
     scared--

                    MERCEDES
          What are you doing out there? Are 
          you crazy?

                    ENRIQUE
          Hay pasado un accidente muy grave-- 
          [There's been a bad accident--]

                    MERCEDES
          In English, Enrique. We're in the 
          United States--

                    ENRIQUE
          I have some friends who have had a 
          accident--

                    MERCEDES
          You have somebody else out there?

                    ENRIQUE
          We was by the river? And I hear my 
          friend callin' for help, and I look 
          and she has falling in the water--

                    MERCEDES
          Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que 
          paso?

                    ENRIQUE
          We was crossin' the river--

     Nestor appears in the light now, supporting Anselma, who 
     hops awkwardly to move forward--

                    MERCEDES
          Enrique! Quienes son estos? How could 
          you bring them here?

                    ENRIQUE
          They need help. Jaime, Anselma-- 
          esta es mi jefa--

                    NESTOR
          Senora--

                    MERCEDES
          I'll call the Border Patrol, they'll 
          get her to the hospital.

                    ENRIQUE
          No! No puede hacer esto--[You can't 
          do that--]

                    MERCEDES
          You think you're doing these people 
          a favor? What are they going to do? 
          Either they get on welfare or they 
          become criminals--

                    ENRIQUE
          No es la verdad--[That isn't true--]

                    NESTOR
          Con permiso, Senora, la muchacha 
          tiene mucho dolor--[Please, Senora, 
          the girl is in a lot of pain--]

     Mercedes grudgingly indicates the lounge chair--

                    MERCEDES
          Sientase. [Sit.]

                    NESTOR
          Es muy amable. [You're very kind.]

     He and Enrique help Anselma into the chair. The Girl looks 
     up at Mercedes, frightened--

                    ANSELMA
          Ayudanos, Senora, por favor no podemos 
          regresar--[Help us, Senora, please. 
          We can't go back]

     Mercedes looks at ANSELMA disapprovingly. The girl can't be 
     more than 14--

                    MERCEDES
          This girl is a friend of yours?

                    ENRIQUE
          Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]

                    MERCEDES
          I thought you were married!

                    ENRIQUE
          I am marry to the cousin of a friend--
          but only to be able to live here. 
          This is the mother of my child--

                    MERCEDES
          This girl has a child?

                    ENRIQUE
          We have a daughter.

                    MERCEDES
               (Scornful)
          Tipico.

     EXT. HOUSE -- NIGHT

     Sam stands at the front door of a house on the lake, banging 
     on the door--

                    SAM
          Hollis? You in there? Hollis?

     EXT. RIVER -- NIGHT

     Moonlight kicks off the surface of the water.  We hear 
     SPLASHING, the frightened VOICE of a young woman--

                    YOUNG MERCEDES (O.S.)
          Donde esta? Estoy perdido--[Where 
          are you? I'm lost--]

                    ELADIO (O.S., DISTANT)
          Aqui! [Here!]

     The girl flounders into the shot, wet and scared. Young 
     Mercedes, a teenager not unlike ANSELMA is wading thigh-deep 
     in the Rio, lost, scared--

                    YOUNG MERCEDES
          No puedo ver la orilla! [I can't see 
          the bank!]

                    ELADIO (O.S.)
          Aqui! Venga por aqui! [Over here! 
          Come this way!]

     Mercedes struggles toward the voice and suddenly a young man 
     becomes visible, standing in the water, holding his band out 
     for her, ELADIO--

                    YOUNG MERCEDES
          Vi a Rosaria arastrado para el  
          corriente--[I saw Rosaria taken away 
          by the current--]

                    ELADIO
          No te molestas. Tenemos a ella. [Don't 
          worry. We've got her.]

     He takes her arm, pulls her toward the far shore--

                    ELADIO
          Como se llama? [What's your name?]

                    YOUNG MERCEDES
          Mercedes Gonzales Ruiz.

                    ELADIO
               (Smiles)
          Me llama Eladio Cruz--Bienvenido a 
          Tejas. [Welcome to Texas.]

                               DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. MERCEDES' HOUSE -- MERCEDES

     Mercedes is lost in thought as she recalls. She steps into 
     the light by the carport. Enrique and Nestor are propping 
     Anselma's leg up on pillows in the back of Mercedes' old 
     station wagon--

                    MERCEDES
          Rapidamente! Everybody in the world 
          is going to see!

                    ENRIQUE
          Donde vamos? [Where are we going?]

                    MERCEDES
          A casa de Porfirio Zayas. He used to 
          be a doctor on the other side.  
          Gunshot wounds, fixing babies--if 
          you can pay he can handle it.

                    ENRIQUE
          Senora, anything it costs, I can 
          work--

                    MERCEDES
          Don't worry about it. He owes me 
          some favors.

     Enrique turns to ANSELMA still frightened in the rear of the     
     station wagon--

                    ENRIQUE
          Seas tranquila, mija.
               (Nods to Mercedes)
          Estamos en las manos de Senora Cruz. 
          [Just relax, honey. We're in the 
          hands of Senora Cruz.]

     Mercedes starts the car--

                    MERCEDES
          In English, Enrique. In English--

     INT. DEL'S HOUSE -- DINING  ROOM

     Del steps in. Chet sits at the table, drawing a cartoon in 
     panels. Del looks over his shoulder for a moment--

     CARTOON

     A tank rolling over barbed wire, cannon and machine gun 
     blasting away--

                    DEL (O.S.)
          Homework?

     DEL AND CHET

                    CHET
          I finished that. I'm just messing 
          around.

                    DEL
          Tanks, huh?

                    CHET
          You got to be in the Army, you might 
          as well have something slick to drive.

                    DEL
          So you're going into the Army?

     Chet looks at him, not in a good mood, then goes back to his     
     drawing--

                    CHET
          That's the general plan, isn't it?

     Del watches for a long moment, thinking--

                    DEL
               (Softly)
          That's up to you.

     Chet looks at his father again. All this is news to him--

                    DEL
          The Army isn't for everybody.

     Chet can't quite believe he is hearing this. Del crosses to 
     the refrigerator--

                    DEL
          Not that I don't think you'd be good 
          at it, but--you know--I wouldn't be 
          disappointed if you decided to do 
          something else with your life.

                    CHET
          You wouldn't?

                    DEL
          No.

     Chet nods, begins to play again, considering the 
     possibilities. Del is making an effort and he doesn't have 
     much practice--

                    DEL
          How's your room shaping up?

                    CHET
          Fine. I'm pretty much moved in.

                    DEL
          Good.

     An awkward silence--

                    CHET
               (Tentative)
          Are we going to ever see your father?

                    DEL
          My father.

                    CHET
          Yeah. He lives here, right?

                    DEL
          He does.

     Del pulls some food out, watching Chet as he draws--

                    DEL
          Maybe we'll clean that thing out 
          back up, have a barbecue next weekend. 
          We could invite him and his wife 
          over.

                    CHET
          Cool.

     Chet flips the page of his sketchbook--

                    CHET
          He makes his own sauce.

     EXT. PARKING LOT, BIG O'S -- NIGHT

     The neon's off, but there are a couple cars in the lot and a 
     light within. Sam pulls into the lot, steps out, approaches 
     the door--

     INT. CLUB

     The door opens. The place is empty now except for Otis, 
     standing behind the bar, deep in conversation with Hollis, 
     sitting on a stool. Both swivel to look around guiltily as 
     they hear Sam step in--

     REVERSE

     Sam walks in slowly, crossing the floor to bring us back to 
     the two men--

                    SAM
          Fellas.

                    HOLLIS
          Hey, Sam.

                    SAM
          Open late.

                    OTIS
          I'm not open. We were just talking.

                    SAM
          Hollis probably told you we found 
          Charley Wade.

                    OTIS
          Yeah. How about that? People start 
          digging holes in this county, there's 
          no telling what'll come up.

     He sits a few stools away from Hollis--

                    SAM
          You two saw it, didn't you? You two 
          saw it when Buddy killed him.

     Hollis and 0tis look at each other--

                    SAM
          Imonna find out one way or the other.

                    HOLLIS
          Your father had the finest sense of 
          justice of any man I ever met--

                    SAM
          Yeah, and my mother was a saint. For 
          fifteen years the whole damn town 
          knew he had another woman on the 
          side. Stole ten thousand dollars to 
          set her up in business. But hell, 
          what's that? You got a problem?  
          Buddy'll fix it. Facing some time in 
          jail? Buddy'll knock half of it off--
          if you do what he says, when he says. 
          You got some business that's not 
          exactly legal? Talk to Buddy--

                    HOLLIS
          Buddy Deeds--

                    SAM
          Buddy Deeds was a murderer.

     He looks at the two older men for a long moment--

                    SAM
          That night in the cafe--he didn't 
          stay long after you left, did he, 
          Hollis? Maybe he decided he'd gone 
          too far with Wade, maybe he figured 
          he better not wait for the Sheriff 
          to get behind him. So he stepped out 
          to see if he could catch up--and you 
          were here at the club that night, 
          weren't you, O?

     Otis sighs, begins to speak softly--

                    OTIS
          I was here.

     CU OTIS

     He turns to look toward the door as he reminisces, and we 
     PAN away with his gaze--

                    OTIS (O.S.)
          I'd been running a game on the side 
          after hours craps, draw poker on the 
          weekends. Roderick didn't know about 
          it. More important, Charley Wade 
          didn't know about it, 'cause I didn't 
          want to cut him in. I suppose I'd 
          been drinking some, and I was pretty 
          full of myself in those days--but 
          hell, I just didn't expect the man 
          so early--

     Sheriff Wade and Young Hollis step in the door and we are 
     back in 1957. BLUES HARMONICA FADES UP, wailing from the 
     jukebox. They stop and look at the place--

     THEIR POV -- CLUB

     MUSIC CONTINUES. The club is empty, dark. A LIGHT shines 
     from the back room.

     INT. BACK ROOM

     MUSIC CONTINUES. Smoke fills the air and Young Otis sits 
     back laughing, a large pile of money on the table in front 
     of him. The other four BLACK MEN at the table aren't doing 
     so well. One by one they all look up past the camera to the 
     door--

     CU OTIS

     MUSIC CONTINUES. Young Otis doesn't see at first, engaged in 
     dealing the cards. Finally, he senses the presence, looks up--

     WADE AND HOLLIS -- YOUNG O'S POV

     MUSIC CONTINUES. Wade stands over the table in the f.g., 
     Young Hollis hanging back in the doorway. Wade is smiling 
     his cold smile, cursing--

     CU YOUNG OTIS

     MUSIC CONTINUES. Trying to look unimpressed--

     EXTREME CU WADE'S EYES

     Cold and unblinking. MUSIC CONTINUES--

     EXTREME CU WADE'S MOUTH

     Twisted in a snarl as he curses. MUSIC CONTINUES--

     MEN, TABLE

     MUSIC CONTINUES. We shoot past Wade's body as the other men 
     step away from the table, grab their hats, and hurry out the 
     side door. Young Otis is left sitting at the table. Wade 
     starts walking toward him--

     CU YOUNG OTIS

     MUSIC CONTINUES. His eyes following as Wade comes to stand 
     over him--

     WADE, YOUNG OTIS

     MUSIC CONTINUES. Wade grabs the table and violently jerks it 
     over onto Young Otis, cards and money flying--

     YOUNG HOLLIS

     MUSIC CONTINUES. Watching squeamishly as Wade goes to work 
     on young Otis, the overhead light swinging wildly--

     INT. BARROOM

     MUSIC CONTINUES. Young Otis is hurled out of the back room, 
     face bruised and bleeding. Wade follows, then Young Hollis--

     CLOSER

     MUSIC CONTINUES.

     CLOSER

     Wade puts his gun next to Young Otis's ear, cursing at him. 
     Young Otis gets to his feet, goes behind the bar--

     BAR COUNTER

     MUSIC CONTINUES. Young Otis slaps an envelope full of cash 
     onto the counter--

     WADE

     MUSIC CONTINUES. He waves his pistol, indicating something 
     behind Otis--

     INT. BAR

     MUSIC CONTINUES. We shoot past Wade at the counter as Otis 
     turns and reaches for a cigar box on the shelf behind--

     CIGAR BOX

     MUSIC CONTINUES. Lying open, an old pistol inside of it. 
     Young Otis reaches--

     CU YOUNG HOLLIS

     MUSIC CONTINUES. Frowning as he senses something wrong--

     WADE

     MUSIC CONTINUES. Wade levels his gun at Young Otis's back, 
     then turns to wink at Hollis like he did before he shot Eladio--

     WADE'S HAND

     MUSIC CONTINUES. Finger closing around the trigger of the 
     .45--

     HOLLIS

     MUSIC CONTINUES. Mouth open in horror--

     WADE

     MUSIC CONTINUES. Eyes burning as he aims--

     BUDDY

     MUSIC CONTINUES. Stepping in the door, seeing, CALLS OUT--

     YOUNG OTIS

     MUSIC CONTINUES. Turning to see Buddy--

     WADE

     BLAM! THWAP! A bullet plows through his neck, knocking him 
     back against the bar.

     MUSIC CONTINUES. His gun falls from his hand--

     YOUNG OTIS

     Horrified, splattered with the Sheriff's blood. MUSIC 
     CONTINUES--

     BAR COUNTER

     MUSIC CONTINUES. Twenty-dollar bills have spilled out of the 
     envelope and are soaking up blood--

     CU BUDDY

     Calm and hard-eyed. MUSIC CONTINUES. As he steps forward, we 
     see his pistol is still in its holster. He reaches out and 
     takes the .45 from Young Hollis's shaking hand, looks him in 
     the eye till Hollis looks back, then looks toward Young Otis--

     We PAN with his gaze to a CLOSE-UP of Otis, back in the 
     PRESENT. The MUSIC FADES--

                    OTIS
          Sheriff Charley had some real big 
          friends in politics then, and if the 
          truth come out it wasn't going to go 
          easy on Hollis.
               (He shrugs)
          I don't know why I trusted Buddy 
          with it--don't know why he trusted 
          me. The first time I ever talked 
          with him was right there, and then 
          with a dead white man leakin' blood 
          on the floor between us. He could 
          charm the scales off a rattler, Buddy 
          Deeds.

     WIDER

     This isn't what Sam was expecting. Hollis watches his face--

                    HOLLIS
          The three of us cleaned up and took 
          him to the post and put him under. 
          Can't say I was much help.

                    SAM
          And the ten thousand?

                    HOLLIS
          Widow's benefits. He figured it would 
          make the disappearance look better, 
          and that Mexican gal was just scrapin' 
          by after Charley killed her man. 
          They didn't get hooked up till late--

                    OTIS
          Time went on, people liked the story 
          that we told better than anything 
          the truth might have been.

     Sam swivels around on his seat to took at the spot where 
     Charley fell. He has a lot of information to deal with--

                    HOLLIS
          What's the call, Sam?

     Sam rolls it over in his mind before answering--

                    SAM
          Don't think the Rangers are likely 
          to find out any more than they  
          already have.

                    HOLLIS
          Word gets out who that body was, 
          people are gonna think Buddy done 
          it.

     Sam gets up--

                    SAM
          Buddy's a goddamn legend. He can 
          handle it.

     He heads for the door--

                    SAM
          'Night, fellas.

     Hollis and Otis watch him go--

                                    FADE OUT:

     EXT. DRIVE-IN, WIDE SHOT -- MORNING

     We see Sam sitting on the hood of his car parked in the 
     deserted drive-in lot, staring up at the ruined screen. 
     Pilar's car rolls in, parks beside him--

     CLOSER

     Pilar gets out, kisses Sam, sits by him on the hood--

                    PILAR
          When's the picture start?

     Sam looks at her for a moment--

                    SAM
          You gonna tell your mother we been 
          seeing each other?

                    PILAR
          She'll figure it out sooner or later. 
          I don't have to ask permission 
          anymore, if that's what you mean.

                    SAM
          You have any idea when your father 
          died? Eladio?

                    PILAR
               (Shrugs)
          Couple months before I was born--

                    SAM
          Try a year and a half. He bands her 
          an old snapshot. PILAR looks at it--

     CU PHOTO

     Buddy and Young Mercedes on the lake. Buddy with his shirt 
     off on one end of a sailboat, Mercedes in a bathing suit, 
     both smiling for the camera--

     SAM AND PILAR

     Pilar hands the photo back to him, tries to be calm--

                    PILAR
          I've never seen my mother in a  
          bathing suit before.  Didn't know 
          she owned one.

                    SAM
          Buddy bought the cafe for her with 
          money he took from the county.    
          Pilar looks away, struggling not to 
          cry--

                    PILAR
          They can't pull this on me. It isn't 
          fair--I don't believe this--

                    SAM
          He paid the hospital bill when you 
          were born. Your mom always calls you 
          "our beautiful daughter" in the 
          letters she wrote to him.

                    PILAR
          From the first time I saw you at 
          school--all those years we were 
          married to other people I always 
          felt like we were connected.

                    SAM
          I remember thinking you were the one 
          part of my life Buddy didn't have a 
          piece of--

     A silence, both of them wondering what the next move should 
     be--

                    PILAR
          So that's it? You're not going to 
          want to be with me anymore?

     Sam knows what he feels but doesn't have the words--

                    PILAR
          I'm not having any more children. 
          After Amado, I had some complications-- 
          I can't get pregnant again, if that's 
          what the rule is about--

                    SAM
          If I met you for the first time today, 
          I'd still want to be with you.

     It is what Pilar needed to hear--

                    PILAR
          We start from scratch--

                    SAM
          Yeah--

                    PILAR
          Everything that went before, all 
          that stuff, that history--the hell 
          with it, right?

     PILAR takes Sam's hand, kisses him--

                    PILAR
          Forget the Alamo.

     WIDE SHOT, DRIVE-IN

     Sam and Pilar sit by each other holding hands, looking at 
     the empty screen--

     MUSIC, ROLL CREDITS

                          THE END
