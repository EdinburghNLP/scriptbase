<b>          EXT - DAIRY FARM- DAY
</b>          The modest dairy farm in the countryside of Nancy, France (what the
          French call cow country).
          We Read a SUBTITLE in the sky above the farm house;

<b>          CHAPTER ONE
</b>
<b>          "ONCE UPON A TIME IN...
</b>
<b>          NAZI OCCUPIED FRANCE"
</b>          This SUBTITLE disappears, and is replaced by another one;

<b>          "1941
</b>          One year into the German
          occupation of France".
          The farm consists of a house, small barn, and twelve cows spread
          about.
          The owner of the property, a bull of a man FRENCH FARMER, brings a axe
          up and down on A tree stump blemishing his property. However simply by
          sight, you'd never know if he's been beating at this stump for the last
          year, or just started today.

<b>          JULIE
</b>          One of his three pretty teenage daughters, is hanging up laundry on
          the clothes line. As she hangs up a white bed sheet, she hears a
          noise, moving the sheet aside she see's;

<b>          JULIE'S POV:
</b>          A Nazi town car convertible, with two little nazi flags attached to
          the hood, a NAZI SOLDIER behind the wheel, a NAZI OFFICER alone in the
          back seat, following TWO OTHER NAZI SOLDIERS on motorcycles, coming up
          over the hill on the country road leading to their farm.

<b>          JULIE
</b>          Pappa.
          The French Farmer sinks his axe in the stump, looks over his shoulder,
          and see's the Germans approaching.
          The FARMERS WIFE, CHARLOTTE comes to the doorway of their home,
          followed by her TWO OTHER TEENAGE DAUGHTERS, and see the Germans
          approaching.
          The Farmer yells to his family in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;

<b>          FARMER
</b>          Go back inside and shut the door.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          IL
</b>
<b>          FARMER
</b>          (to Julie)
          Julie, get me some water from the pump
          to wash up with, then get inside with
          your mother.
          The young lady runs to the water pump by the house. She picks up a
          basin, and begins pumping, after a few pumps, water comes out
          splashing into the basin.
          The French Farmer sits down on the stump he was previously chopping
          away at, pulls a handkerchief from his pocket, wipes sweat from off
          his face, and waits for the Nazi convoy to arrive. After living for
          a year with the sword of Damocles suspended over his head, this may
          very well be the end.
          Julie finishes filling the water basin, and places it on the window
          sill.

<b>          JULIE
</b>          Ready Pappa.

<b>          FARMER
</b>          Thank you darling, now go inside and
          take care of your mother. Don't run.
          Julie walks inside the farm house and closes the door behind her.
          As her father stands up from his stump, and moves over to the window
          sill with the water basin...
          .The SOUND of the ENGINES of the two motorcycles and car get LOUDER.
          The Farmer SPLASHES water from the basin on his face and down his
          front. He takes a towel off a nail, and wipes the excess water from
          his face and chest, as he watches the two motorcycles, the one
          automobile, and the four representatives of the National Socialist
          Party come to a halt on his property.
          We don't move into them, but keep observing them from a distance, like
          the Farmer.
          The TWO NAZI MOTORCYCLIST are off their bikes, and standing at
          attention next to them.
          The NAZI DRIVER has walked around the automobile, and opened the door
          for his superior.
          The NAZI OFFICER says to The Driver in UNSUBTITLED GERMAN;

<b>          NAZI OFFICER
</b>          This is the property of Perrier LaPadite?

<b>          
</b>

<b>          
</b>
<b>          3
</b>
<b>          NAZI DRIVER
</b>          Yes heer Colonel.
          The Nazi officer climbs out of the back the vehicle, carrying
          in his left hand
           n d

<b>          OFFICER
</b>          Herman, until I summon you, I am to be
          left alone.

<b>          NAZI DRIVER
</b>          As you wish Heer Col.
          The S.S. COLONEL yells to The Farmer in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;

<b>          NAZI OFFICER
</b>          Is this the property of Perrier LaPadite?

<b>          FARMER
</b>          I am Perrier LaPadite.
          The S.S. Colonel crosses the distance between them with long strides,
          and says in French with a smile on his face;

<b>          NAZI OFFICER
</b>          It is a pleasure to meet you Monsieur
          LaPadite, I am Colonel Hans Landa of
          the S.S.
          COLONEL.HANS LANDA offers the French Farmer PERRIER LAPADITE his hand.
          The Frenchman takes the German hand in his and shakes it.

<b>          PERRIER
</b>          How may I help you?

<b>          COL LANDA
</b>          I was hoping you could invite me inside
          your home and we may have a discussion.

<b>          INT - LAPADITE FARM HOUSE - DAY
</b>          The door to the farm house swings open, andtheaFarmer gesturestfor
          the S.S. COL to enter. Removing his grey S.S. cap,
          inside the Frenchman's home.
          Col Landa is immediately greeted with the sight of the Farmers wife,
          and three pretty daughters standing together in the kitchen, smiling
          in his direction.
          The Farmer enters behind him, closing the door.

<b>

<b>

</b>
<b>          PERRIER
</b>          Colonel Landa, this is my family.
          The S.S. COL clicks his heels together, and takes the hand of the
          French Farmers Wife...

<b>          COL LANDA
</b>          Col Hans Landa of the S.S. madame,
          at your service.
          He kisses her hand, then continues without letting go of his hostess
          hand...

<b>          COL LANDA
</b>          please excuse my rude intrusion on your
          routine.

<b>          FARMERS WIFE
</b>          Don't be ridiculous, heer Col.
          While still holding the French Woman's hand, and looking into her
          eyes, The S.S. Colonel says;

<b>          COL LANDA
</b>          Monsieur LaPadite, the rumors I have
          heard in the village about your family
          are all true. Your wife is a beautiful
          woman.
          His eyes leave the mother, and move to the three daughters.

<b>          COL.LANDA
</b>
<b>          (CON' T )
</b>          And each of your daughters is more lovely
          then the last.

<b>          PERRIER
</b>          Merci. Please have a seat.
          The Farmer offers The S.S. Colonel a seat at the families wooden
          dinner table. The Nazi officer excepts the French Farmers offer,
          and lowers himself into the chair. Placing his grey S.S. cap on
          the table, and keeping his black attache case on the floor by his
          feet.
          The Farmer (perfect host) turns to his Wife and says;

<b>           PERRIER
</b>          Charlotte, would you be so good as to get
          The Colonel some wine?

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          COL LANDA
</b>          Merci be coupe Monsieur LaPadite, but no
          wine. This being a dairy farm one would
          be safe in assuming you have milk?

<b>          CHARLOTTE
</b>          Oui.

<b>          COL LANDA
</b>          Then milk is what I prefer.

<b>          CHARLOTTE
</b>          Very Well.
          The mother of three, takes a craft of milk out of the ice box,
          and pours a tall glass of the fresh white liquid for The Colonel.
          The S.S. Colonel takes a long drink from the glass, then puts it down
          LOUDLY on the wooden table.

<b>          COL LANDA
</b>          Monsieur, to both your family, and your
          cows, I say; Bravo.

<b>          PERRIER
</b>          Merci.

<b>          COL LANDA
</b>          Please, join me at your
          table.

<b>          PERRIER
</b>          Very well.
          The French Farmer sit's at his wooden dinner table across from
          The Nazi.
          The Women remain standing.
          Col Landa leans forward, and says to the Farmer in a low tone of

<b>          CONFIDENTIALLY;
</b>
<b>          COL LANDA
</b>          Monsieur LaPadite, what we have to
          discuss,' would be better discussed in
          private. You'll notice, I left my men
          outdoors- if it wouldn't offend them,
          could you ask your lovely ladies to step
          outside.

<b>          PERRIER
</b>          You are right.

<b>

          Charlotte, would you take the girls
          outside. The Colonel and I need to have
          a few words.
          The Farmers wife follows her husbands orders, and gathers her
          daughter's taking them outside, closing the door behind them.
          The Two Men are alone, at the farmers dinner table, in the Farmers
          humble home.

<b>          COL LANDA

          charge of rounding up the Jews left in
          France who are ether hiding, or passing

          The S.S.Colonel smiles.

</b>          The Fuhrer couldn't of said it better

<b>          PERRIER
</b>          But the meaning of your visit, pleasant
          though it is, is mysterious to me.
          The Germans looked through my house nine
          months ago for hiding Jews, and found
          nothing.

<b>          COL LANDA
</b>          I'm aware of that, I read the report on

          always a slight duplication of efforts.
          Most of it being a complete waste of time,
          but needs to be done nevertheless.
          I just have A few questions Monsieur

          file on your family.
          Taking his black leather attache case, and placing it on the table, he
          takes out a folder from inside. He also extracts a expensive black
          fountain pen from his uniform front pocket. Opening the folder, and
          referring to it;

          The Farmer gets up from the table, goes to his shelf over the
          fireplace, and removes from it a WOODEN BOX that contains all the
          fixins to his pipe. He sits back down at the table with his Nazi
          guest.
          As The Farmer loads the bowel of his pipe with tobacco, sets a match
          to it, and begins slowly puffing, making it red hot, the S.S. Colonel
          studies the papers in front of him.

          the Jewish families in this area have
          been accounted for - except, The Dreyfusis.
          Somewhere in the last year it would appear
          they have vanished.
          Which leads me to the conclusion that
          they've ether made good their escape,
          or someone is very successfully hiding
          them.

</b>          Again, this is just a rumor - but we
          heard the Dreyfusis had made there way

          beings are The DREYFUSIS, who have lived lying down underneath the

          Dreyfusis have done for the last year living. This family has done the
          only thing they could, hidden from a occupying army that wishes to
          exterminate them.

          The S.S. Colonel takes in this answer, seems to except it, then moves
          to the next question.

          Farmer stands up, goes over to the ice box, and takes out the

          German Officer talks.

<b>          COL LANDA
</b>          Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the

</b>          What are you aware of?

<b>          PERRIER
</b>          That they call you, "The Jew Hunter".

<b>          COL LANDA
</b>          Precisely! Now I understand your
          trepidation in repeating it.
          Before he was assassinated, Heydrich
          apparently hated the moniker the good
          people of Prague bestowed on him.
          Actually why he would hate the name,
          "The Hangman", is baffling to me
          It would appear he did everything in
          his power to earn it. But I, on the
          other hand, love my unofficial title,
          precisely because I've earned it.
          As "The Jew Hunter" enjoys his fresh milk, he continues to theorize
          with the french farmer.

<b>          COL LANDA
</b>          The feature that makes me such a effective
          hunter of the Jews, is, as opposed to most
          German soldiers, I can think like a jew.
          where they can only think like a German,
          or more precisely, a German soldier.
          Now if one were to determine what attribute
          the German people share with a beast, it
          would be the cunning and predatory instinct
          of a hawk.

          But, if one were to determine what attributes
          the jews share with a beast, it would be
          that of the rat.
          Now the Fuhrer and Gobbles propaganda
          have said pretty much the same thing.
          Where our conclusions differ, is I don't
          consider the comparison a insult.
          Consider for a moment, the world a rat
          lives in. It's a hostile world indeed.
          If a rat were to scamper through your
          front door right now, would you greet it
          with hostility?

<b>          PERRIER
</b>          I suppose I would.

<b>          COL LANDA
</b>          Has a rat ever done anything to you to
          create this animosity you feel toward

</b>          - Unless some fool is stupid enough to
          try and handle a live one, rats don't
          make it a practise of biting human beings.
          Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague,
          but that was some time ago. In all your
          born days, has a rat ever caused you to
          be sick a day in your life? I purpose to
          you, any disease a rat could spread,
          a squirrel could equally carry.
          Yet I assume you don't share the same
          animosity with squirrels that you do with
          rats, do you?

<b>          COL LANDA
</b>          However, interesting as the thought may
          be, it makes not one bit of difference

          through your door, this very minute,
          would you offer it a saucer of your
          delicious milk?

<b>          PERRIER

<b>          COL LANDA
</b>          I didn't think so. You don't like them.
          You don't really know why you don't like
          them. All you know is, you find them
          repulsive.
          (let's the

<b>          METAPHOR
</b>          sink in)
          What a tremendously hostile world a rat
          must endure. Yet, not only does he
          survive, he thrives. And the reason for
          this, is because our little foe has a
          instinct for survival and presavation
          second to none. And that Monsieur, is
          what a jew shares with a rat.
          Consequently, a German soldier, conducts
          a search of a house suspected of hiding
          jews. Where does the hawk look? He looks
          in the barn, he looks in the attic,
          he looks in the cellar - he looks
          everywhere, he would hide. But there are
          many places it would never occur to a
          hawk to hide. However the reason the
          Fuhrer brought me off my Alps in Austria,
          and placed me in French cow country today,
          is because it does occur to me. Because
          I'm aware what tremendous feats human
          beings are capable of once they abandon
          dignity.

          the same thing. She's a young girl, no food,
          no shelter, no shoes, who's just witnessed
          the massacre of her entire family.
          She may not survive the night. And after
          word spreads about what happened today,
          it's highly unlikely she will find any
          willing farmers to extend her aid.
          If I had to guess her fate, I'd say she'll
          probably be turned in by some neighbour.
          Or, she'll be spotted by some German
          soldier. Or, we'll find her body in the
          woods, dead from starvation or exposure.
          Or, perhaps-she'll survive. She will
          elude capture. She will escape to America.
          She will move to New York city.
          Where she will be elected, President of
          the United States.
          The S.S. Colonel chuckles at his little funny.

          LIEUTENANT ALDO.RAINE, a hillbilly from the mountains of
          Tennessee, walks down the line. He recruits the men, the
          Germans will later call; "The Basterds". Lt.Aldo has one
          defining physical characteristic, a ROPE BURN around his
          neck. As if once upon a time,. he survived a LYNCHING.
          The scar will never once be mentioned.

          Eight - Jewish - American - soldiers.
          Now y'all might of heard rumors
          about the armada happening soon.
          Well, we'll be leavin a little
          earlier. We're gonna be dropped
          into France, dressed as civilians.
          And once we're in enemy territory, as
          a bushwackin, guerrilla army, we're
          gonna be doin one thing, and thing
          only, Killin Nazi's.
          The Members of the National Socialist
          Party, have conquered Europe through
          murder, torture, intimidation, and
          terror. And that's exactly what we're
          gonna do to them. Now I don't know

          come down from the goddamn Smoky
          mountains, cross five thousand miles
          of water, fight my way through half
          Sicily, and then jump out of a fuckin
          air-o-plane, to teach the Nazi's
          lessons in humanity. Nazi ain't got
          no humanity. There the foot soldiers
          of a Jew hatin, mass murderin manic,
          and they need to be destroyed.

          And the Germans, will talk about us.

          interrogations since Germany decided
          it should rule Europe. But this is
          the first time he's ever been on the
          wrong end of the exchange.

          weakling, in mind, body, and spirt
          complies with the enemy under threat
          of consequence.
          As Werner watched men cry like women,

          If his role is to die in this conflict.
          When they put him under the earth, his

          For in the other world, the gods only

          Well Sgt, this is your test.
          And the gods are watching.
          The captured German Sgt, enters the circle of Basterds,
          stands straight before the sitting southern Lieutenant, and
          salutes his captor.

          WE SEE Pvt.Butz in The Fuhrer's room for the first time.
          He wears a Nazi cap, which is unusual in the presence of The
          Fuhrer, but he seems okay with it.

          to burn it!
          The young German is telling Aldo, what he thinks, Aldo wants
          to hear. But the last answer didn't go down as well as he
          thought it would, evident by the frown on Aldo's face.

<b>          LT. ALDO
</b>          Yeah, that's what we thought. We don't
          like that. You see, we like our Nazi's
          in uniforms. That way, you can spot 'em,
          just like that.
          (Snaps his fingers)
          But you take off that uniform, ain't
          nobody gonna know you was a Nazi.
          And that don't sit well with us.
          Aldo removes a LARGE KNIFE from a sheath on his belt.

<b>          INT - CINEMA AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
</b>          We're in the auditorium of a cinema in Paris. However the
          CAMERA is pointed in the direction of the audience, not the
          screen. We start CLOSE on the projector beam, emanating from
          the little glass window in the back of the theatre
          The CAMERA continues to DOLLY back, making the Shot Wider and
          Wider, bringing in more and more the German occupied citizens
          of Paris, who stare at the OFF SCREEN silver screen in the dark
          We can hear the OFF SCREEN SOUNDTRACK of a Goebbels produced
          German omm paw paw musical movie being projected.
          The Shot continues to pull further and further back, and the
          German dialogue continues to fill the auditorium...

<b>          TILL...
</b>          .The DOLLY SHOT LANDS on a CLOSE UP of Shosanna,. watching the

</b>          We hear the sound of the German musicals climax.
          The lights go up in the auditorium.
          Shosanna, dressed in a NURSES UNIFORM she swiped from
          somewhere, remains seated, as the rest of the PATRONS, gather
          their coats, and file out.

</b>          Patrons exit under the cinema marquee, as someone from inside
          SHUTS OFF the marquees lights.
          The MARQUEE READS in French:
          "GERMAN NIGHT BRIDGET VON HAMMERSMARK in MADCAP IN MEXICO".

<b>          EXT - PROJECTION BOOTH (LITTLE CINEMA)
</b>          A French Black Man, who we will learn later is named MARCEL,
          is the cinema's projectionist. We see him for a moment, taking
          the film reels off the projector, and placing them on rewinds.

<b>          INT - AUDITORIUM
</b>
<b>          CU SHOSANNA
</b>          still sitting in her seat. Except for her, the auditorium is
          empty.
          The owner of the Cinema, a attractive looking French woman,
          who we will later know as MADAME MIMIEUX, appears in
          one of the cinema's opera box balconies.
          Looking down from her perch at the young girl, sitting in
          the empty cinema.
          The DIALOGUE will be spoken in FRENCH, and SUBTITLED into

<b>          ENGLISH.
</b>
<b>          MADAME MIMIEUX
</b>          So young woman, since it's beyond obvious
          we're closed for the evening. I must assume
          you want something. What can I do for you?

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          May I sleep here tonight?

<b>          MADAME MIMIEUX
</b>          So I gather your not a nurse?

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          No.

<b>          MADAME MIMIEUX
</b>          But your a bright little thing, that's
          clever disguise. Where is your family?

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          We were from Nancy. The Bosch found us

<b>          MADAME MIMIEUX
</b>          Is this a sad story?

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Oui.

<b>          MADAME MIMIEUX
</b>          Sad stories bore me. These days everyone
          in Paris has one. I haven't bore you
          with mine, don't bore me with yours.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          You can run the machines?

<b>          MADAME MIMIEUX
</b>          What machines?
          Using her hands to pantomime the rotating film reels on a
          projector, she says;

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          The machines that show the film?

<b>          MADAME MIMIEUX
</b>          The projectors? Yes, I own a cinema,
          of course I can operate them.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          I know, I saw you.

<b>          FLASH ON:

<b>          BACK TO SHOSANNA
</b>
<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Teach me. Teach me to run the machines,

<b>          MADAME MIMIEUX
</b>          I know at least six people who've been
          put up against a wall, and machine
          gunned for sheltering enemies of the
          state. I have no intention of being
          unlucky number seven. How long have
          you been in Paris?

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          A week, and a few days.

<b>          MADAME MIMIEUX
</b>          How have you survived the curfew
          without capture?

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          I sleep on rooftops.

<b>          MADAME MIMIEUX
</b>          Again, I'm forced to admit, clever
          girl. How is it?

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Cold.

<b>          MADAME MIMIEUX
</b>
<b>          (LAUGHS)
</b>          I can imagine.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Respectfully, no you can't.

<b>          MADAME MIMIEUX
</b>          Fair enough.

<b>          MADAME MIMIEUX
</b>          So you can't operate a 35mm film projector,
          you want me teach you, in order to work
          here, in order to use my cinema, as a hole
          to hide in, is that correct?

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Oui.

<b>          MADAME MIMIEUX
</b>          Whats your name?

<b>          MADAME MIMIEUX
</b>          I'm Madame Mimieux. You may call
          me Madame. This is a cinema. Not a
          home for wayward war orphans.
          Having said that, what you say is true.
          If you were truly exceptional, I could
          find use for you. So Shosanna, are you
          truly exceptional?

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Oui Madame.

<b>          MADAME MIMIEUX
</b>          I will be the judge of that.

<b>          THEN...
</b>          The CAMERA PULLS BACK, and we see we're not looking at a TITLE
          CARD at all, but a CALENDER stuck on the wall of the Little
          Cinema's Projection Booth. Before we leave it, WE SEE the
          Month is JUNE.
          ..The CAMERA finds, the THREE YEARS OLDER SHOSANNA, working
          as the PROJECTIONIST. It would appear, that Shosanna passed
          Madame Mimieux's exceptional test.
          A lyrical Morriconie-like tune PLAYS on the SOUNDTRACK, this
          will be "Shosanna's Theme".
          A Little Bell, begins RINGING, on one of the projectors,
          alerting Shosanna it's time for a REEL CHANGE.
          Shosanna stands at the projector, watching the old German film
          she's projecting, waiting for the1st REEL CHANGE MARK...

          Shosanna emerges from the cinema carrying two buckets of
          LETTERS (for the marquee), and a tall ladder. Her chore here,
          obviously, is to change the show on the marquee.
          The LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the Soundtrack in ENGLISH;

<b>          NARRATOR(VO)
</b>          To operate a cinema in Paris during
          the occupation, one had two choices.
          Ether you could show new German propaganda
          films, produced under the watchful
          eye of Joseph Goebbels. Or... .you
          could have a German night in your
          weekly schedule, and show allowed
          German classic films.
          Their German night was Thursday.
          Shosanna, by herself, perched up high on the ladder, changing
          the letters on the marquee.
          A YOUNG GERMAN SOLDIER(about the same age as Shosanna), walks
          out of the cinema. He sees the ladder with the young French
          girl on top, and walks over.
          They speak FRENCH, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

<b>          GERMAN SOLDIER

</b>          Ummmm, I always preferred Linder to
          Chaplin. Except Linder never made a
          film as good as "The Rid". The chase
          climax of "The Kid", superb.
          Shosanna continues working, not adding to the conversation.

<b>          GERMAN SOLDIER
</b>          I suppose now you could use a "M"
          a "A" and a "X"?

<b>          SHOSANNA

</b>          But you do admire the director. Pabst,

</b>          Even Germans. Merci for assistance,
          Private. Adieu.
          She turns to go back inside.

<b>          GERMAN SOLDIER
</b>          Your not finished?

<b>

<b>

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          I'll finish in the morning.
          She opens the door to go inside.

<b>          GERMAN SOLDIER
</b>          May I ask your name?

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          You wish to see my papers?
          She hands him her excellently forged papers.
          That's obviously not what he meant, but he takes them anyway
          to read her name.

<b>          GERMAN SOLDIER
</b>          Emmanuelle Mimieux. That's a very
          pretty name.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Merci. Are you finished with my papers?
          He hands them back.

<b>          GERMAN SOLDIER
</b>          Mademoiselle. My name is Fredrick Zoller.
          She gives no response.

<b>          GERMAN SOLDIER
</b>          It's been a pleasure chatting with a
          fellow cinema lover. Sweet dreams,
          Mademoiselle.
          He gives her a little salute, and walks into the black of a
          curfew imposed night.
          She looks after him. She didn't show it, but he kinda got to
          her. After all, for any true cinema lover, it's hard to hate
          anybody who, CINEMA MON AMOUR.

<b>          EXT - ROOFTOP CINEMA - NIGHT
</b>          Shosanna stands on the roof of her cinema, late at night,
          lighting up a cigarette. As she takes her first big drag,
          she remembers a voice.

<b>          FLASH ON
</b>          MADAME MIMIEUX, the younger Shosanna, and the black
          projectionist Marcel, in the projection booth. Shosanna
          lights up a cigarette, and Madame Mimieux SLAPS her face
          HARD, knocking the cigarette out of her mouth. Marcel
          quickly STAMPS it out on the floor.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>          If-7.

<b>          MADAME MIMIEUX
</b>          if I ever see you light up a cigarette
          in my cinema again, I'll turn you into
          the Nazi's, do you understand?
          Shosanna is shocked by this statement.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Oui, Madame.

<b>          MADAME MIMIEUX
</b>          And for bringing a open flame in my
          cinema, you deserve far worse then
          a Nazi jewish boxcar. With your thick
          head, what do you think the highest
          priority of a cinema manager is?
          Keeping this fucking place from burning
          down to the ground, that's what!
          In my collection, I have over 350,
          35mm, nitrate film prints, which are
          not only immensely flammable, but
          highly unstable. And should they
          catch fire, they burn three times
          faster then paper. If that happens..
          .POOF...all gone, cinema no more,
          every body burned alive. If I ever
          see you with a open flame in my cinema
          again, I won't turn you into the Nazi's
          I'll kill you myself. And the fucking
          Germans will give me a curfew pass.
          Do you understand me?

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Out, Madame.

<b>          MADAME MIMIEUX
</b>          Do you believe me?

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Out, Madame.

<b>          MADAME MIMIEUX
</b>          You damn well better.

<b>          BACK TO ROOF
</b>          Shosanna exhales cigarette smoke.
          Marcel comes onto the roof.

<b>          MARCEL
</b>          Are you well?

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Even on the roof I can't smoke a
          cigarette without hearing Madames
          voice yelling at me. That's why I
          do it. To hear Madames voice again.

<b>          MARCEL
</b>          We both miss her.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          I know. I'm fine, darling. I'll be
          to bed soon.
          Marcel goes back inside, Shosanna smokes.

<b>          INT - FRENCH BISTRO - AFTERNOON
</b>          Shosanna sits in the back of a French bistro, reading a
          book, "The Saint in New York" by Leslie Charteris, drinking
          wine. When the young German Private from the other day,
          FREDRICK ZOLLER, walks in. He gets a beer, then notices the
          French girl sitting in the back. He smiles, and heads over
          to her. "Oh no, not this guy again", she thinks.
          Again they speak in FRENCH SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          May I join you?

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Look Fredrick -

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>
<b>          (SMILING)
</b>          - You remember my name?

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Yes....Look, you seem a pleasant
          enough fellow -

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          - Merci.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Your welcome. - regardless, I want
          you to stop pestering me.

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          I apologize mademoiselle, I wasn't
          trying to be a pest. I was simply
          trying to be friendly.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          I don't wish to be your friend.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          Why not?

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Don't act like a infant. You know why.

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          I'm more then just a uniform.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Not to me. If you are so desperate for
          a French girlfriend, I suggest you try
          Vichy?
          Just then TWO OTHER GERMAN SOLDIERS come over, obviously
          very impressed with Fredrick. They make a fuss over him in
          UNSUBTITLED GERMAN, which nether Shosanna, or the non German
          speaking members of the movies audience, can understand.
          He signs autographs for them, shakes their hands, and they
          go on their way.
          Shosanna's eyes narrow.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Who are you?

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          I thought I was just a uniform?

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Your not just a German soldier, are
          you somebodies son?

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          Most German soldiers are somebodies son.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Yeah, but your not just somebody. What
          are you, Hitlers nephew?
          He leans in across the table, she leans in too, and he says;

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          Yes.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Really?

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          No not really, I'm just teasing you.
          She leans back annoyed.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Then what is it? What are you, a German
          movie star?

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          6'O
</b>
<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          Not exactly.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          (Pfuit), what does that mean, "not exactly".
          I asked if you were a movie star, the
          answer to that question, is yes or no.
          Fredrick laughs at that line.

<b>          FREDRICR
</b>          When you said that just now, you
          reminded me of my sister.
          This catches young Shosanna off guard.

<b>          FREDRICR
</b>          I come from a home of six sisters.
          We run a family operated cinema in Munich.
          Seeing you run around your cinema,
          reminds me of them. Especially my sister
          Helga. She raised me, when our father
          wasn't up to the job. I admire her very
          much. You'd like her, she doesn't wear a
          German uniform.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          You were raised by Helga?

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          All my sisters, I'm the baby, but Helga
          was the bossiest.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          And your mother and father?

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          My mother died. And my father was a
          loser. My fathers moto; "If at first
          you don't succeed, quit". The day he
          left, good riddance. My sisters are
          all I need. It's why I like your cinema.
          It makes me feel both closer to them,
          and a little homesick at the same time.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          is your cinema still operatiing?

<b>          FREDRICR
</b>          Oui.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          What's it called?

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          5!
</b>
<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          The Kino Haus.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          How has it done durring the war?

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          Actually, in Germany, cinema
          attendance is up.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          No doubt, you don't have to operate
          under a curfew.

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          How often do you fill your house?

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          (Pfuit), not since before the war.

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          So if you had one big engagement, that
          would help you out?

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Of course, but that's not likely to
          happen.
          TWO MORE GERMAN SOLDIERS and their TWO FRENCH DATES approach
          the table. They ask for Fredricks autograph, he signs it for
          them. One of the French Girls says in FRENCH, how exciting
          it is to meet a real live German war hero. Shosanna hears
          it. They leave. So that's it, she thinks.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          So your a war hero? Why didn't you tell me?

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          Everybody knows that, I liked you didn't.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          What did you do?
          He takes a sip of beer.

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          I've shot the most enemy soldiers
          in world war two...so far.
          You bet your sweet ass that got her attention.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Wow.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          52
</b>
<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          I was alone in a bell tower in a
          walled off city in Russia. It was
          myself, and a thousand rounds of ammo,
          in a bird's nest, against three
          hundred Soviet soldiers.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          What's a bird's nest?

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          A bird's nest is what a sniper would call
          a bell tower. It's a high structure,
          offering a three hundred and sixty degree
          view. Very advantageous for marksmen.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          How many Russian's did you kill?

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          Sixty-eight.

<b>          (BEAT)
</b>          The first day. A hundred and fifty the
          second day. Thirty-two, the third day.
          On the forth day, they exited the city.
          Naturally my war story received alot of
          attention in Germany, that's why they
          all recognize me. They call me the
          German Sgt.York.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Maybe they'll make a film about
          your exploits.

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          Well, that's just what Joseph Goebbels
          thought. So he did. It's called "Nation's
          Pride", and guess what, they wanted me to
          play myself, so I did. They have posters
          for it in kiosks all over Paris. That's
          another reason for all the attention.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          "Nation's Pride" is about you? "Nation's
          Pride" is starring you?

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          I know, comical, huh?

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Not so comical. So what are you doing
          in Paris, enjoying a rest?

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          53.
</b>
<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          Hardly. I've been doing publicity,
          having my picture taken with different
          German luminaries, visiting troops,
          that sort of thing. Goebbels wants the
          film to premier in Paris, so I've been
          helping them in the planning.
          Joseph is very keen on this film.
          He's telling anybody who will listen,
          when "Nation's Pride" is released,
          I'll be the German Van Johnson.
          Shosanna, wasn't falling for the young German, by any stretch.
          However his exploits, as well as his charming manner, can't
          help but impress. But his referring to Goebbels as "Joseph",
          like their friends, is all she needed to get on the right side
          of things. This young man is trouble with a capital "T", and
          she needs to stay far fucking away from him.
          She abruptly rises, and says;

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Well, good luck with your premier
          Private. I hope all goes well for
          Joseph and yourself. Au revoir.
          And with that, she disappears. Leaving the perplexed private
          alone.

<b>          EXT - CINEMA MARQUEE - DAY
</b>          It's the next day.
          Shosanna and Marcel are changing the letters on the marquee.
          Marcel excuses himself to visit the toilet.
          $hosanna is alone outside the little cinema, perched up on her
          ladder.

<b>          WHEN...
</b>          .A BLACK NAZI SEDAN pulls up in front of the little cinema.
          A GERMAN MAJOR in a black Gestapo uniform steps out of the back
          of the sedan.
          The DRIVER, a German Private, steps out as well.
          Yelling to the young girl up high on the ladder;
          Both GERMAN and FRENCH will be SUBTITLED into ENGLISH.

</b>          Oui?
          Telling his Driver in German to ask her in French;

<b>          GESTAPO MAJOR
</b>          Ask her if this is her cinema?
          in French The Driver asks Shosanna;

<b>          DRIVER
</b>          is this your cinema?

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>
<b>          GESTAPO MAJOR
</b>          Tell her to come down.

<b>          DRIVER
</b>          Come down please.
          She climbs down the ladder.
          The Driver opens the back door of the sedan, indicating for her
          to get in.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          I don't understand, what have I done?

<b>          DRIVER
</b>          (to Major)
          She wants to know what she's done?

<b>          GESTAPO MAJOR
</b>          Who says she's done anything?

<b>          DRIVER
</b>          Who says you've done anything?
          Then in her best imitation of Madame Mimeux's arrogantmanner.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Then I demand to know what this is about,
          and where do you propose to take me?
          The Driver begins to translate, when the Gestapo Major holds up his
          hand, telling him not to bother. The Major looks at the young
          French girl and tells her in German;

<b>

</b>          Get your ass in that car.
          No translation necessary. She climbs into the back of the car,
          followed by the Germans. The sedan takes off.

<b>          INT - SEDAN(MOVING) - DAY

          The sedan stops.
          The car door opens and the Driver offers Shosanna his hand.

<b>          EXT/INT- MAXIUM'S (FAMOUS PARIS CAFE) - DAY
</b>          She steps out of the car, and is lead into a Paris cafe by the
          Gestapo Officer. It takes the young Jewess a moment or two before
          she realizes she's not being led to a Gestapo interrogation
          room, a railroad car, or a concentration camp, but to lunch.
          The best table at Maxims. Three people, and two dogs, sit at it.
          Germany's Minister of Propaganda, and the number two man in
          Hitlers Third Reich, JOSEPH GOEBBELS, his female French translator
          (and mistress), FRANCESCA MONDINO, and young Private Zoller,
          are the people. TWO BLACK FRENCH POODLES, belonging to
          Mademoiselle Mondino, sit together in another chair at the
          table.
          We join them in mid-conversation;
          They all speak GERMAN, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

          Shosanna is lead through the French eatery by the Gestapo Major.
          Private Zoller see's her, and stands up, excuse's himself,
          and greets her before she reaches the table.
          Fredrick says in French, SUBTITLED in ENGLISH;

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          Good you came. I wasn't sure weather or
          not you'd except my invitation.

          Fredrick?
          Private Zoller turns in his direction, takes Shosanna by the
          arm, and leads her to him.

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          Yes it is, beer Goebbels. Emmanuelle,
          there is somebody I want you to meet.
          Joseph Goebbels, remaining seated, looks up at the young French
          girl, scrutinizing her as he spoons creme brule into his mouth.
          The excited Fredrick introduces Shosanna to the propaganda
          minister formally.

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          Emmanuelle Mimieux, I'd like to

          German film industry, and now I'm a
          actor, my boss, Joseph Goebbels.
          Goebbels offers up his long spider-like fingers for Shosanna to
          shake. She does.

</b>          Actually, I didn't introduce myself.
          (to Shosanna)
          Major Deiter Helistrom of the Gestapo, at

          (he clicks
          his heels)
          Please allow me, have a seat.
          The Gestapo Officer pulls out a chair, for the young lady to sit
          down. Shosanna takes the hot seat. Seated to her right is
          Private Zoller. To her left are the two curly pampered
          poodles. Major Helistrom pours Shosanna a glass of red wine
          from a small craft on the table.

<b>          MAJOR HELLSTROM
</b>          Try the wine mademoiselle, it's quite good.
          Goebbels looks across the table at her.

<b>          GOEBBELS
</b>          well I must say, you've made quite a

          Francesca interprets Goebbels German for Shosanna.

</b>          I must say fraulein, I should be rather
          annoyed with you.

          Private Zoller interrupts -

          to abandon previous plans for Private
          Zollers film premier, and change the

</b>          Nonsense. Until I ask a few
          questions, he has nothing to inform.

</b>          Three hundred and fifty.

<b>          GOEBBELS
</b>          That's almost four hundred less
          then The Ritz.
          Fredrick jumps in...

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          But beer Goebbels, that's not such
          a terrible thing. You said yourself
          you didn't want to indulge every
          two faced french bourgeois taking

</b>          Besides, to hell with the French.
          This is a German night, a German
          event, a German celebration. This
          night is for you, me, the German
          military, the high command, their
          family and friends. The only people
          who should be allowed in the room,
          are people who will be moved by
          the exploits on screen.
          Goebbels listens silently, then after a bit of a pause;

<b>          GOEBBELS
</b>          I see your public speaking has
          improved. It appears I've created
          a monster. A strangely persuasive
          monster. When the war's over,

          Table chuckles.

<b>          GOEBBELS
</b>          Well Private, though it is true,
          I'm inclined to indulge you anything.
          I must watch a film in this young
          ladies cinema before I can say,
          yes or no.

          So young lady, you are to close
          your cinema tonight, and have
          a private screening me.
          Francesca interprets...

</b>          What German films do you have?
          Francesca asks..

<b>          SHOSANNA

          Francesca interprets...

<b>          GOEBBELS
</b>          That's nonsense fraulein. Us Germans

          That era of German cinema is dead.

          Zoller, thinking fast, says;

          I'm sure Emmanuelle hasn't seen. it.
          And it's so funny, I've been meaning
          to recommend it to her, for her
          German night. That's a great idea,

<b>          GOEBBELS

          ...the empty chair next to the young Jewish girl is suddenly
          filled with the bottom half of a grey S.S. officer uniform.

<b>          GOEBBELS
</b>          Ah Landa, your here, this is the

<b>          FRANCESCA
</b>          Oh, yes of course.
          She repeats it by whispering it in Goebbels ear.

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          What sort of discussion?

<b>          COL LANDA
</b>          That sounded suspiciously like a

          Laughter all around. The Reich Minister and his axis entourage,
          make their way to front of the cafe, with the two dumb dogs on
          a leash, leading the way.

<b>          COL LANDA

          Col Landa offers the young jew in hiding a seat at a small
          table in the outside patio area of Maxims.
          The fluency and poetic proficiency of the S.S. jew hunters
          french, revels to the audience, that his feigning clumsiness at

</b>          No.

<b>          COL LANDA
</b>          Yes, two strudels, one for myself,
          and one for the mademoiselle. A cup
          of espresso, with a container of.
          steamed milk, on the side.
          For the Mademoiselle, a glass of milk.

          she was on a dairy farm, her strudel companion murdered her
          entire family, his ordering her milk is, to say the

          I had no knowledge of Private Zoller,

          was simply just a patron of my cinema.

<b>          COL LANDA
</b>          - Mademoiselle, let me interrupt you.
          This is a simple formality, no

          The Colonel takes one look at it, and says to the Waiter;

          The Waiter returns, applying cream fresh to the two strudels.
          The S.S. Colonel looks across the table at his companion, picking
          up his fork, he says;

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Of course I can.

<b>          COL LANDA
</b>          Knowing the Reich Minister as I do,

          the success or failure of his
          illustrious evening, dependent on
          the prowess of a negro. So if it

          operate the projectors. Is that

          Col Landa takes another bite of strudel, Shosanna follows suit.

<b>          COL LANDA

          quite smitten with you?

<b>          SHOSANNA

          aren't of a romantic nature.

<b>          COL LANDA
</b>          Mademoiselle...?

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Colonel, his feelings are not
          romantic. I remind him of his sister.

<b>          COL LANDA
</b>          That doesn't mean his feelings
          aren't romantic.

</b>          It's sounding more and more romantic
          by the minute.
          Landa takes out a handsome looking cigarette case, with a S.S.
          LOGO on it. Removing on of the fags, he lights it up with a
          fancy S.S. gold lighter. He offers one to Shosanna.

<b>          COL LANDA
</b>          Cigarette?

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          No thank you.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Yes.

<b>          COL LANDA

          I hope your not nationalist about
          your tobacco, to me French cigarettes
          are a sin against nicotine.
          She takes one, but makes no move to light it.
          He inhales deep, and says;

<b>          COL LANDA
</b>          I did have some thing else I wanted
          to ask you, but right now, for the
          life of me, I can't remember what it
          is. Oh well, must not of been important.
          Col Landa stands up, throws some French francs on the table,
          puts on his grey S.S. cap, touches his finger to his visor,
          saluting Shosanna, and saying:

<b>          COL LANDA
</b>          Till tonight.
          And with that he's gone.
          Shosanna breaths a sigh of relief.
          The CAMERA begins to slowly lower from a MEDIUM CU to her feet
          ankles and floor. We see her shoes are in a puddle of urine.
          During her conversation and strudel with the man that
          exterminated her entire family, shosanna pissed herself.
          She drops the German cigarette in to the piss puddle by her
          feet.

          to be amused by the aryan antics of
          Goebbels Frank Capra copy, "Lucky
          Kids", a thought suddenly comes to
          her.
          We see her face get slightly distracted behind the eyes.

<b>          NARRATOR (VO)

          She chuckles at the thought, though it looks like she's
          laughing at the German comedy.

<b>          NARRATOR(VO)
</b>          The screening of "Lucky Kids" was a
          complete success. And Heer Goebbels
          conceded to have the venue changed
          to Shosannas cinema. Not only that,
          in a moment of inspiration, Heer
          Goebbels had a idea.
          Goebbels speaks GERMAN, and Francesca translates;

<b>          GOEBBELS
</b>          I must say, I appreciate the modesty
          of this auditorium. Your Cinema
          has real respect, almost church like.
          Not to say we couldn't spruce the
          place up a bit. In Versailles
          there's a crystal chandelier hanging
          in the banquet hall that is
          extraordinary. we're going to get it,
          and hang it from the very middle of
          auditorium roof. Also I want to go to
          Louvre, pick up a few Greek nudes,
          and just scatter them about the lobby.

</b>          we see a quick series of shots that show all that happening.
          The chandelier being removed from the ceiling of Versailles.
          Greek nude statues being hand trucked out of the Louvre.
          A truck driving through the french countryside with the
          enormous crystal chandelier in the back.
          The lobby of Shosanna's cinema, pimped out in Nazi iconography.
          WORKERS buzz around decorating. The Greek statues are moved
          into place.
          We see Workers trying with incredible difficulty, to hoist the
          huge, heavy, and twinkingly fragile chandelier, in Shosannas
          auditorium, which now resembles something out of one of Tinto
          Brass's Italian B-movie rip off's of Visconti's "The Damned".

          She closes the door on him. Watching the Nazi's walk into the

          Marcel sits at the top of the staircase of the lobby, looking
          down at Shosanna.
          They speak in FRENCH SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

</b>          About what?

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          About these Hun swine, commandeering
          our cinema.

<b>          MARCEL
</b>          What about it?
          She slowly walks up the stairs to Marcel. She makes him part
          his legs, and sits on the lower step, between his legs. Her
          back up against his chest, his arms around her shoulders.
          Shosanna has only known this type of intimacy with Marcel.

</b>          I'm not talking about that, your
          talking about that.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          No, we're talking about that,
          right now. If we can keep this
          place from burning down by
          ourselves, we can burn it down
          by ourselves.

<b>          MARCEL
</b>          Shosanna -

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          No, Marcel, just for sake of argument,
          if we wanted to burn down the cinema,
          for any number of reasons, you and I
          could physically accomplish that, no?

<b>          MARCEL
</b>          Oui Shosanna, we could do that.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          And with Madame Mimieux's 350 nitrate
          film print collection, we wouldn't
          even need explosives, would we?

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Oui, that's exactly what I mean.

          Bel Ami, years).
          Upon entering the room, Lt.Hicox is gobsmacked.
          Standing before him is legendary military mastermind,
          GENERAL ED FENECH, a older George Sanders type (Village of the
          Dammed).
          But in the back of the room, sitting behind a piano,
          smoking his ever present cigar, is the unmistakable
          bulk of WINSTON CHURCHELL.

          Drink?
          Hicox's eye's go to the formidable bulldog behind the piano,
          who's scrutinizing him behind his cigar. However the man behind
          the cigar makes no gesture, and the General, makes no
          acknowledgment of the three hundred pound gorilla in the room.
          Which Lt.Hicox knows enough to mean, if Churchell isn't
          introduced, he ain't there.

<b>          LT. HI COX
</b>          Yes. Obviously I haven't seen any of
          the films made in the last three

</b>          Pardon sir?

<b>          GEN.FENECH
</b>          This little escapade of ours,
          requires a knowledge of the German
          film industry under the Third Reich.
          Explain to me UFA, under Goebbels?

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          Goebbels considers the films he's
          making to be the beginning of a new
          era in German cinema. A alternative
          to what he considers the Jewish
          German intellectual cinema of the
          twenties. And the Jewish controlled
          dogma of Hollywood.
          SUDDENLY... Bellowing from the back of the room;

<b>          CHURCHELL
</b>          How's he doing?

<b>          LT. H I COX
</b>          Frightfully sorry sir, once again?

<b>          CHURCHELL
</b>          You say he wants to take on the Jews
          at their own game? Compared to say
          .Louis B.Mayer...how's he doing?

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          Quite well, actually. Since Goebbels
          has taken over, film attendance has
          steadily risen in Germany over the
          last eight years. But Louis B.Mayer
          wouldn't be Goebbels proper opposite
          number. I believe Goebbels see's himself
          closer to David O.Selznick.
          Gen.Fenech looks to the Prime Minister.
          With a puff of cigar smoke, Churchell says;

<b>          CHURCHELL
</b>          Brief him.

<b>          GEM.FENECH
</b>          Lt.Bicox, at this point in time I'd
          like to brief you on, Operation Kino.
          Three days from now, Joseph Goebbels is
          throwing a gala premier of one of his
          new movies in Paris -

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          - What film sir?
          The General has to resort to peeking at his file.

<b>          GEN.FENECH
</b>          The motion pictures called; "Nation's
          Pride".

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          Oh, you mean the film about Private
          Zoller?

<b>          GEN.FENECH
</b>          We don't have any intelligence, on
          exactly, what the film that night
          will be about.

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          But it's called "Nation's Pride"?

<b>          GEN.FENECH
</b>          Yes.

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          I can tell you what it's about,
          it's about Private Fredrick Zoller.
          He's the German Sgt.York.
          Fenech can't help suppress a smile, they have the right man.

<b>          GEN.FENECH
</b>          In attendance at this joyous Germatic
          occasion, will be Goebbels, Gerring,
          Boorman, and most of the German High
          command, including all high ranking
          officers of both The S.S., and, The
          Gestapo. As well as luminaries of the
          Nazi propaganda film industry.

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          The master race at play, aye?

<b>          GEN.FENECH
</b>          Basically, we have all our rotten
          eggs in one basket. The objective of
          Operation Kino.... Blow up the basket.

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          (Reciting a
          a poem)
          "...and like the snows of yesteryear,
          gone from this earth". Jolly good, sir.

<b>          GEN.FENECH
</b>          An American Secret Service outfit,
          that lives deep behind enemy lines,
          will be your assist. The Germans call
          them; "The Basterds".

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          "The Basterds", never heard of them.

<b>          GEN.FENECH
</b>          Whole point of the secret service,
          old boy, you not hearing of them.
          But the Gerrys have heard of them,
          because these yanks have been them
          the devil. Their leader is a chap
          named Lt.Aldo Raine. The Germans
          call him, "Aldo the Apache".

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          Why do they call him that?

<b>          GEN.FENECH
</b>          Best guess, is because he removes the
          scalps of the Nazi dead.

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          Scalps, sir?

<b>          GEN.FENECH
</b>          The hair.
          He runs his finger along his hairline.

<b>          GEN.FENECH
</b>          Like a red Injun.

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          Rather gruesome sounding little
          Dicky bird, isn't he?

<b>          GEN.FENECH
</b>          No doubt the whole lot, a bunch a
          nutters. But you've heard the
          expression, "It takes a thief".

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          Indeed.
          General Fenech continues on with his exposition, moving over
          to a military map.

<b>          GEN.FENECH
</b>          You'll be dropped into France, about
          twenty four kilometers outside of Paris.
          The Basterds will be waiting for you.
          First thing, you go to a little village
          called, "Nadine".
          (He points it
          out on the map)
          Apparently the Gerrys never go there.
          In Nadine, there's a tavern, called,
          "La Louisiane", you'll rendez-vous
          with our double agent, and she'll take
          it from there. She's the one who's
          going to get you in the premiere.
          It will be you, her, and two German
          born members of the Basterds. She's
          also made all the other arrangements
          your going to need.

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          How will I know her?

<b>          GEN.FENECH
</b>          I suspect that won't be too much
          trouble for you. Your contact is
          Bridget Von Hammersmark.

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          Bridget Von Hammersmark? The German
          movie star is working for England?

<b>          GEN.FENECH
</b>          For the last two years now. one could
          even say Operation Kino was her
          brainchild.
          In the back of the room the bulldog barks;

<b>          CHURCHELL
</b>          Extraordinary women.

<b>          LT.BICOX
</b>          Quite.

<b>          GEN.FENECH
</b>          You'll go to the premiere as her
          escort, lucky devil. She'll also
          have the premiere tickets for the
          other two. Got the gist?

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          I think so, sir. Paris when it sizzles.

</b>          We find somebody who can develop

          make them do it, or we kill them.
          Once we tell them what we want to

<b>          NADINE, FRANCE"
</b>          TWO SHOT LT.HICOX and LT.ALDO RAINE
          Aldo is dressed like a French civilian. Hicox is dressed in a
          German grey S.S. Cap't uniform. They look out of a window, in a
          apartment, in the village of Nadine, overlooking the tavern.

<b>          LT.ALDO
</b>          You didn't say the goddamn rendez-vous
          was in a fuckin basement.

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          I didn't know.

<b>          LT.ALDO
</b>          You said it was in a tavern?

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          it is a tavern.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          LT.ALDO
</b>          Yeah, in a basement. You know,
          fightin in a basement offers a lot
          of difficulties, number one being,
          your fighting in a basement.
          Wilhelm Wicki, joins the SHOT, dressed in a German S.S.
          Lieutenant uniform.

<b>          WICKI
</b>          What if we go in there, and she's
          not even there?

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          We wait. Don't worry, she's a British
          spy, she'll make the rendez-vous.
          WE SEE the other Basterds, dressed in French civilian clothes,
          are in the room as well, they are, Donowitz, Hirschberg,
          and Utivich. And in the back of the room, dressed in the grey
          uniform of a S.S. Lieutenant, Hugo Stiglitz sits off by himself,
          sharpening his S.S. DAGGER on his leather belt looped around his
          boot. Anybody not in the scene from the Basterds opening
          chapter, is dead.
          Lt.Hicox watches Stiglitz off by himself on the other side of
          the room, SHARPENS his dagger menacingly.
          .Stiglitz is fucking werid...
          Lt.Hicox approaches Stiglitz...

<b>          LT.NICOX
</b>          Stiglitz, right?

<b>          STIGLITZ
</b>          That's right, sir.
          He continues bringing the blades edge, up, then, down on the
          leather strap.

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          I hear your pretty good with that?
          Meaning the blade. Stiglitz doesn't answer.

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          You know, we're not looking for
          trouble, right now. We're simply
          making contact with our agent.
          Should be uneventful. However, on
          the off chance I'm wrong, and things
          prove eventful. I need to know, we can
          all remain calm.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          99.
</b>          The renegade Gerry Sergeant, stops his blades progress, and
          looks up at the limy Lieutenant.

<b>          STIGLITZ
</b>          I don't look calm to you?

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          Well, now you put it like that,
          I guess you do.
          He turns his attention back to his blade.
          Hicox moves over to Aldo, and asks him privately;

<b>          LT. HI COX
</b>          This Gerry of yours, Stiglitz?
          Not exactly the loquacious type,
          is he?
          Aldo just looks at him.

<b>          LT.ALDO
</b>          Is that the kinds man you need, the
          loquacious type?

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          Fair point, Lieutenant.

<b>          LT.ALDO
</b>          So y'all git in trouble in there,
          what are we suppose to do?
          Make bets on how it all comes out?

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          If we get into trouble, we can
          handle it. But if trouble does
          happen, we need you to make damn
          sure no Germans, or French, for
          matter, escape from that basement.
          If Frau Von Hammersmark's cover is
          compromised, the mission is kaput.

<b>          SGT.DONOWITZ
</b>          Speaking of Frau Von Hammersmark,
          who's idea was it for the death trap
          redez-vous?

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          She chose the spot.

<b>          SGT.DONOWITZ
</b>          Well isn't that just dandy?

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          Look, she's not a military strategist.
          She's just a actress.

<b>          LT.ALDO
</b>          Ya don't got to be Stonewall
          Jackson to know you don't want to
          fight in a basement.

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          She wasn't picking a place to fight.
          She was picking a place, isolated,
          and without germans.

<b>          PFC.HIRSCHBERG
</b>          Lieutenant, I hate to be contrary,
          but I got me a Nazi pissin on
          Louisianna two-o'clock.
          They move to the window, and sure enough, ONE LONE NAZI
          PRIVATE, relieves himself against the side wall.
          Lt.Bicox, this was definitely, not the plan.

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          Shit.
          Sgt.Donowitz chides him;

<b>          SGT.DONOWITZ
</b>          So what do you think your fraulein
          Von Hammer -

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          - Obviously, I don't know,Sgt.
          The British officer watches the German soldier, who's not
          suppose to be there. When Hugo Stiglitz joins him at the
          window. Stiglitz looks down at the urinating Nazi, S.S. dagger
          in hand.

<b>          STIGLITZ
</b>          If we're going, let's go.
          He sheaths the dagger.

<b>          EXT - LA LOUISIANE (BASEMENT TAVERN) - NIGHT
</b>          The GERMAN PISSING PRIVATE, sloppily finishes his task.
          Craming his noodle back in his pants, he descends the stairs
          that lead him back into the basement tavern. We Follow him...

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          INT - LA LOUISIANE (BASEMENT TAVERN)- NIGHT
</b>          .Inside the basement tavern, La Louisiane. it has a very low
          hanging basement ceiling. A old looking wood bar off to the
          right. And the only other space in the little tavern, is taken
          up by two large(at least in here) tables, which take up both
          half's of the room. And despite rumors to the contrary, one of
          the two tables, is completely filled with drunken celebrating
          Nazi enlisted men, of which our urinating friend is one of
          five.

<b>          FIVE NAZI'S
</b>          ONE GERMAN MASTER SGT, ONE FEMALE GERMAN SGT (a powerfully built
          stocky type), and THREE MALE GERMAN PRIVATES.
          The Five Nazi's are sitting around the table, drinking, and
          playing a very fun game with none other then the fraulein of
          the hour, UFA diva, BRIDGET VON HAMMERSMARK. Dressed to the
          nines in a chic Forties style women's suit, complete with
          fedora. The game their playing consists of each player having
          a card with the name of a famous person, real or imaginary,
          stuck to their forehead. The player doesn't know what name is
          on their forehead. So they ask the others questions to figure
          out who they are.
           The Five Germans, five cards read; MASTER SGT #1(POLA NEGRI),

<b>          FEMALE SGT #2(BEETHOVEN), GERMAN PRIVATE #3(MATA HARI),
</b>
<b>          GERMAN PRIVATE #4 (EDGAR WALLACE), GERMAN PRIVATE #5
</b>           (WINNETOU). And Bridget Von Hammersmark, who wears her card in
          the brim of her fedora, has GENGHIS KHAN.
          It's German#5 (WINNETOU) turn to ask questions.
           The DIALOGUE will be in GERMAN, and SUBTITLED into ENGLISH.
          Also, while some dialogue will be written for the German
          Soldiers, it will be mostly made up from the exuberance
          of their game playing, and celebrating.

<b>          WINNETOU
</b>          .okay, I'm not German. Am I American?
          The whole table bursts out laughing.

<b>          FEMALE SGT/BEETHOVEN
</b>          Yes you arel

<b>          EDGAR WALLACE
</b>          Well, not really.

<b>          SGT.POLA NEGRI
</b>          What do you mean, not really? Of
          course he is.

<b>

<b>

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          91
</b>
<b>          EDGAR WALLACE
</b>          Well if he's so American, how come
          he's never been translated into
          English? He's not American. He's
          suppose to be American, but he's not
          a American creation. In fact, he's
          something very different.

<b>          WINNETOU
</b>          Okay, I'm a fictional, literary
          character, from the past, I'm American,
          and that's controversial.

<b>          BRIDGET/GENGUS
</b>          No it's not controversial. The nationally
          of the author, has nothing to do with
          the nationally of the character.
          The Character is the character.
          Hamlet's not British, he's Danish.
          So yes, this character was born in
          America.

<b>          WINNETOU
</b>          Well I'm glad that's settled. If I had
          a wife, would she be called a squaw?
          He's got it.
          The table Laughs.
          The TABLE

<b>          YES!
</b>
<b>          WINNETOU
</b>          Is my bloodbrother, Old Shatterhand?
          The TABLE
          Yes!

<b>          WINNETOU
</b>          Did Karl May write me?
          The TABLE
          Yes!
          In the BACKGROUND, WE SEE, our three counterfeit German
          Officers, Hicox, Wicki, and Stiglitz, enter the basement
          tavern. They obviously. see the five German soldiers, but their
          too far away for us (the audience) to read their face. No
          doubt their less then happy. Fraulein Von Hammersmark
          see's them as well. Without getting up, she waves to them.

</b>
<b>          BRIDGET
</b>          Hello, my lovelies, I will join you
          in moments. I'm finishing up a game
          with my five new friends here.

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          No hurry, Frau Von Hammersmark.
          Take your time, enjoy yourself.

<b>          BRIDGET
</b>          (To Winnetou)
          So who are you?

<b>          WINNETOU
</b>          I am WINNETOU, CHIEF of the APACHES!
          The table CHEERS, and APPLAUD the Apache Chief, as he takes
          the card off his forehead.
          The other Four German Soldiers drink down there beer(part of
          the game).
          Bridget Von Hammersmark knock backs her champagne.

<b>          MATA HARI
</b>          Frau Von Hammersmark, when your
          friends came in, did you realize
          you did a double take, like in the
          movies?

<b>          BRIDGET
</b>          Really? No, I wasn't aware of that
          at all.

<b>          MATA HARI
</b>          They must be second nature to you now?
          Did they teach you how to do a double
          take in the movies?

<b>          BRIDGET
</b>          Well, yes they did, but it's not really
          that difficult.

<b>          SGT.POLA NEGRI
</b>          Do one for us.
          The Tableheartily agrees.
          Bridget looks directly at the Master Sgt, and does a perfect,
          and perfectly funny, Double Take.
          The Table loves it.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>          q3.

<b>          MATA HARI
</b>          My turn, I want to try.
          Mata Hari, looks directly at Beethoven, and does a Double
          Take.

<b>          EDGER WALLACE
</b>          I want to try.
          He does.
          Soon the whole Table is doing dueling Double Takes.

<b>          HICOX - WICKI - STIGLITZ
</b>          watch the table do dueling Double Takes. Obviously, they don't
          understand.

<b>          THEN...
</b>          .Bridget Von Hammersmark rises, and excuses herself from the
          Table. She removes the card stuck in her fedora, looking at
          the name Gengus Khaun for the first time.

<b>          BRIDGET
</b>          Gengus Khaun! I would never of gotten that.
          She walks over, and joins the masquerading Germans table, the
          Gentlemen rise. She greets each warmly with a french cheek
          kiss, as if she knows them well.
          They all take a seat. The two Basterds, and one Brit, drink
          Whiskey. The taverns PROPRIETOR, a older, big bellyed
          Frenchman named EARL, comes over to the table, and pours more
          champagne into Bridget's Champagne glass. He leaves, returning
          back behind the bar, with the YOUNG FRENCH BARMAID, the only other
          person in the establishment.
          Obviously, they speak GERMAN, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          I thought this place was suppose to
          have more French then Germans?

<b>          BRIDGET
</b>          Normally that's true. The Sgt over
          there's wife, just had a baby. His
          commanding officer gave him, and his
          mates the night off to celebrate.

<b>          WICXI
</b>          We should leave.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          BRIDGET
</b>          F No, we should stay. For one drink at
          least. I've been waiting for you in a
          bar, it would look strange if we left
          before we had a drink.

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          She's right, just be calm, and enjoy
          your booze.

<b>          BACK TO THE GERMAN TABLE
</b>          The French Barmaid, has taken Bridget's place in the rousing,
          rowdy game. She tells them, her person must be French, or she
          won't know them. Winnetou thinks for a moment, then writes a
          name on a card. The Barmaid puts it on her forehead, It says;

<b>          NAPOLEON.
</b>          The Germans all laugh.

<b>          BACK TO THE BASTERDS TABLE
</b>
<b>          BRIDGET
</b>          There's been some new developments.
          The cinema venue has changed.

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          Why?

<b>          BRIDGET
</b>          No one knows. But that in itself
          shouldn't be a problem. The cinema
          it's been changed to is considerably
          smaller then The Ritz. So whatever
          materials you brought for The Ritz,
          should be doubly effective here.
          Now this next piece of information
          is colossal, try not to over react.
          The Fubrer, will be attending tomorrow.
          Hugo Stiglitz does a SPIT TAKE.
          Bridget's eyes bore holes in him.

<b>          BACK TO THE REAL GERMANS
</b>          They see Hugo do the spit take, and burst out laughing.
          Keeping it up, they begin to do dueling spit takes, like they
          did dueling double takes earlier. Needless to say, they all
          get wet.

<b>

          You'll be going as Ernst Schuller.
          You'll say your a associate producer
          on Riefenstahl's "Tiefland". It's the
          one German production not under Goebbels
          control, and Leni wouldn't be caught dead
          at a Goebbels film affair.

<b>          BACK TO REAL GERMAN TABLE
</b>          Master Sgt.Pola Negri, drinks his beer, as he looks over,
          dreamily, at Bridget Von Hammersmark at the other table.

<b>          BACK TO BASTERDS
</b>          We See in Bridget continues to brief Hicox on his identity.
          the B.G., the German Master Sgt stand up from his table, and
          head toward Fraulein Von Bammersmark.

<b>          BRIDGET
</b>          .the films gone through many delays,
          and Leni's heath is deteriorating, so
          if you have to speak...
          Hicox, seeing the German Master Sgt approach, signals for her
          to cool it.

<b>          SGT.POLA NEGRI
</b>          Frau Von Hammersmark, I was just
          thinking, could you sign a autograph
          to my son on his birthday?

<b>          BRIDGET

          (To the Table)
          This handsome happy Sgt, just became
          a father today.
          The Pretend Officers offer congratulations to the Sgt.
          The German Master Sgt, CLICKS his heels, and bows before his
          superior officers.

<b>          SGT.POLA NEGRI
</b>          Thank you, heil Hitler.
          He raises his hand .... as do the seated phony officers; "Heil
          Hitler".
          As she takes a rather fancy fountain pen from her clutch..

<b>          BRIDGET

          He thrusts out his beer stein, for the officers to cheers.
          They do.
          Bridget finishes signing her autograph, with a big flourish.

<b>          BRIDGET
</b>          There you go. But wait, I'm not finished yet.
          She reaches into her clutch, and pulls out some lipstick.
          Applies some ruby red color to her lips, and then kisses the
          napkin, leaving a big red lip print. Then hands the treasured
          item to the young father.

<b>          BRIDGET

<b>          SGT.POLA NEGRI
</b>          Thank you fraulein, thank you. Max may
          not know who you are now. But he will.
          I will show him all of your movies.
          He will grow up with your films,
          and this napkin on his wall.
          Then, to the whole tavern...

<b>          SGT.POLA NEGRI

          The whole room toasts.
          This would be a good time for the German Sgt to go back to his
          table, and his men. And he almost does.... but... since he is
          drunk, and star struck, he out wears his welcome.

          The Five known Germans move aside, reveling the unknown German
          in the room, unseen till now, our old friend from before
          MAJOR DEITER HELLSTROM of the GESTAPO. The Major stands from
          the little table he was sitting at.

<b>          MAJOR HELLSTROM
</b>          Like the young newly christened father,
          I too have a acute ear for accents.
          And like him, I too find yours odd.
          From where do you hail, Cap't?
          Wicki jumps in;

</b>          I was speaking to Cap't I--don't-know-what.
          The Gestapo Major is now standing beside Sgt.Pola, before the
          impostors table.
          Lt.Hicox, calmly explains his origin.

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          I was born in the village that rests
          in the shadow of Piz Palu.

<b>          MAJOR HELLSTROM
</b>          The mountain?

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          Yes. In that village we all speak like
          this. Have you seen the Riefenstahl film?

<b>          MAJOR HELLSTROM
</b>          Yes.

<b>

          torch scene?

<b>          MAJOR HELLSTROM
</b>          Yes I do.

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          In that scene was myself, my father,
          my sister, and my two brothers. My
          brother is so handsome, the director
          Pabst, gave him a Close Up.
          As Bridget Von Hammersmark places a cigarette in a ivory
          cigarette holder, which Hicox, as if on cue, lights for her,
          she says;

<b>          BRIDGET
</b>          Major, if my word means anything, I can
          vouch for everything the Young Cap't has
          just said. He does hail from the bottom
          of Piz Palu, he was in the film,
          and his brother is far more handsome
          then he.
          The impostors laugh.
          Then....so does the Gestapo Major. He turns to the Sgt.

<b>          MAJOR HELLSTROM
</b>          You should rejoin your friends.
          Which the young Sgt is more then happy to do. That table
          begins playing there game again.
          Major Hellstrom, the highest ranking officer in the room, bows
          graciously to the female German celebrity.

<b>          MAJOR HELLSTROM
</b>          May I join you?

<b>          BRIDGET
</b>          By all means, Major.
          The Gestapo Major sits at the table, opposite Lt.Hicox, and
          Wicki. The French Barmaid brings over the Majors beer stein.

<b>          MAJOR HELLSTROM

</b>          I must say, that game their playing
          looks like a good bit of fun. I didn't
          join them, because your quite right Cap't,

          fraternize. But seeing as we're all

          Lt.Hicox begins to refuse, when Bridget (feeling she knows
          better), interrupts him;

</b>
<b>          WUNDERBAR
</b>          The Major borrows five cards from the other table, and lays
          them out in front of Bridget and the officers.

<b>          MAJOR HELLSTROM
</b>          So the object of the game, is to write
          the name of a famous person on your card.
          Real or fictitious, doesn't matter. For
          instance, you could write Confucius or
          Fu Manchu.

          And they must be famous. No Aunt Inga's.
          When you finish writing, put the card
          face down on the table, and move it to
          the person to your left. The person to
          your right, will move their card in
          front of you. You pick up the card
          without looking at it, lick the back,
          and stick it on your forehead like so.

          guess who you are...
          As Major Hellstrom finishes explaining the finer points of the
          game, The CAMERA PANS OFF HIM, and BEGINS SLOWLY ZOOMING INTO
          STIGLITZ. The Majors dialogue begins to FADE AWAY.
          Untill we're in a SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK. Which is RED
          FILTERED FOOTAGE of Hugo being savagely WHIPPED by somebody
          wearing a GESTAPO UNIFORM, SUPERIMPOSED over his CLOSE UP.
          The Flashback disappears. It's driving Stiglitz crazy, being
          this close to a Gestapo uniform, and not plunging a knife into
          it.
          The Majors Voice comes back on the soundtrack.

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          I was saying that makes two of us. I've
          had a gun pointed at your balls since

</b>
<b>          INT - SHOSANNAS AND MARCELS LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT
</b>          We're in Shosannas and Marcels living quarters, above the
          cinema. We've never been in here before.

<b>          A SUBTITLE APPEARS ON SCREEN:
</b>
<b>          NIGHT OF "NATION'S PRIDE" PREMIERE
</b>          She's standing before a full length mirror, in a real
          attractive Forties style dress for the premiere. She's stunning.
          This is the first time in her life she's had the opportunity,
          or the occasion to wear something like this. Since she knows
          this is the last night of her life, no time like the present.
          SOUNDS of the hub-bub of the premiere, not to mention the
          German brass band that's blaring Third Reich Marches, can be
          heard coming from below.
          Shosanna walks to her apartment window, and looks down at the
          Germatic miasma below.
          SHOSANNAS POV: WE SEE all the pageantry below. Tons of
          SPECTATORS. Tons of guests dressed in Nazi uniforms, tuxedos,
          and female finery, walking up the long red carpet(with a big
          Swastika in the middle, naturally) leading into Shosannas
          cinema. The German brass band omm-pa-pa-ing away. German Radio
          and Film crews covering the event for the fatherland back
          home. And of course, MANY GERMAN SOLDIERS providing security
          for this joyous Germatic occasion.
          Shosanna COUGHS up a lugi, and HOCKS it.
          A GERMAN S.S. GENERAL, being interviewed by a RADIO COMMENTATOR,
          the lugi HITS him right on his bald head.
          Shosanna goes back to the full length mirror, places a very
          fashionable Forties style hat on her head, then lowers the
          period style black fish net veil over her face. She takes out
          a small GUN, and puts it in the pocket of her dress., and it's
          on. She exits the apartment door, to join the premiere.
          From this point on, there's no turning back, it's all the way
          baby, all the fucking way!

</b>
<b>          INT - CINEMA STAIRWELL - NIGHT
</b>          The stairwell in the building that connects the living
          quarters, with the cinema. She walks down the stairs, goes
          through a door that puts her next to the projection booth
          door. She takes out a key and opens it.

<b>          INT - PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT
</b>          Marcels prepping the film reels for tonight. The five silver
          metal film cans that carry one 35mm reel of film each are laid
          out. The cans for reels one and two are empty. Cans for reel
          three, our specially marked can for reel four, and can for
          reel five(which should never see the light of a projector)
          lie in wait.
          Shosanna, looking like a Forties movie star, enters the
          projection booth.
          The scene in FRENCH SUBTITLED in ENGLISH;

<b>          MARCEL
</b>          Ooh lala, Danielle Darrieux, this
          is so exciting. Pleased to meet you.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Shut up fool.
          Marcel lifts up the veil covering her face, and their lips
          meet.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Cheeky black bugger. I have to go
          down and socialize with these Hun
          pigs. Let's go over it again?

<b>          MARCEL
</b>          Reel one is on the first projector.
          Reel two is on the second. Three
          and four are ready to go.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Okay, the big sniper battle in the
          film begins around the middle of
          the third reel. Our film, comes on
          in the forth reel, so Somewhere
          towards the end of the third reel,
          go down and lock the doors of the
          auditorium. Then take your place
          behind the screen, and wait for my
          CUE, when I give it to you, BURN IT DOWN!

<b>          INT - CINEMA LOBBY - NIGHT
</b>          The pageantry of the evening is in full swing, as all the
          German beautiful people, enter the cinema. They mingle in the
          swastika covered, greek nude statue peppered lobby. Nazi
          Military Commanders, High Ranking Party Officials, and German
          Celebrities(Emil tannings, Veit Harlin), hob knob and drink
          Champagne from passing WAITERS who carry glasses on silver
          trays.
          We see Shosanna enter from the area at the top of the big
          staircase in the lobby that overlooks the lobby parlor
          entrance. She descends the staircase, and busies herself with
          theatre stuff.
          At the top of the staircase, looking down at the master race
          in all there finery, is Colonel Hans Landa, dressed in his
          finest SS Uniform, smoking on his Calabash.

<b>          CAMERA FRAME
</b>          directly behind him. On the right side, we see the figure of
          Col.Landa, from behind, watching the guests entering the
          cinema. On the left side of frame, is the cinema entrance,
          from a looking down perspective of the guests entering the
          building.

<b>          THEN...
</b>          .A THINK BUBBLE, like in a comic book, appears on the left
          side of frame, obscuring the cinema entrance. Inside of Landas
          think bubble, a little scene plays out.

<b>          THINK BUBBLE
</b>          Inside a hospital room filled with DOCTORS, NURSES, and a
          PATIENT in a hospital bed. Then Col.Landa enters the room, and
          screams at everybody;

<b>          COL.LANDA
</b>          I want everybody out of this room!
          They start to leave.

<b>          COL.LANDA
</b>          That means now, goddamnit!
          They RUSH OUT.
          He walks over to the Patient in the hospital bed, Its none
          other then SGT.WILLI, and yes, he's still alive.
          Landa pulls up a chair next to the bed, sits down.

<b>          COL.LANDA
</b>          Can you speak, Sgt?

</b>          Yes Colonel.

<b>          COL.LANDA
</b>          Tell me everything that happened in
          there?
          The THINK BUBBLE DISSOLVES away, reveling the entrance again,
          and as if on perfect cue, in walks Bridget Von Hammersmark,
          dressed lovely, leg in a big white cast. The three basterds in
          their tuxedos, flank her.

<b>          CU COL.LANDA
</b>          smiles.
          He descends the stairs, towards the four saboteurs...
          They speak in GERMAN, SUBTITLED in ENGLISH;

<b>          COL.LANDA
</b>          Fraulein Von Hammersmark, what
          has befallen Germany's most elegant
          swan?

<b>          BRIDGET
</b>          Colonel Landa, it's been years.
          Dashing as ever I see.

<b>          COL.LANDA
</b>          Flattery will get you everywhere,
          fraulein.
          They chuckle, and air kiss.

<b>          COL.LANDA
</b>          So what's happened to your lovely
          leg, a by product of kicking ass in
          the German cinema, no doubt.

<b>          BRIDGET
</b>          Save your flattery, you old dog.
          I know too many of your former
          conquests, to fall into that honey
          pot.
          Chuckle-chuckle...

<b>          COL.LANDA
</b>          Seriously, what happened?

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>

</b>
<b>          
</b>

</b>
<b>          BRIDGET
</b>          Well, I tried my hand, foolishly I
          might add, at mountain climbing.
          And this was the result.

<b>          COL.LANDA
</b>          Mountain climbing? That's how you
          injured your leg, mountain climbing?

<b>          BRIDGET
</b>          Believe it or not, yes it is.
          A brief moment passes between the two...

<b>          THEN...
</b>          The Colonel BURSTS OUT with UPROARIOUS LAUGHTER. So uproarious
          in fact, that it's quite disconcerting to the four saboteurs.
          The Colonel begins to regain his composure...

<b>          COL.LANDA
</b>          Forgive me, fraulein. I don't mean
          laugh at your misfortune. It's just
          .mountain climbing? I'm curious
          fraulein, what could of ever
          compelled you to undertake such a
          foolhardy endeavor?
          The Double meaning is not lost on the German actress.

<b>          BRIDGET
</b>          Well, I chant be doing it again,
          I can tell you that.

<b>          COL.LANDA
</b>          That cast looks as fresh as my old
          Uncle Gustave, when were you climbing
          this mountain, last night?

<b>          BRIDGET
</b>          Very good eye, Colonel. It happened
          yesterday morning.

<b>          COL.LANDA
</b>          Hummm. And where exactly in Paris
          is this mountain?
          This stops her for a seconded.
          Then Landa laughs it off, taking them off the hook.

<b>          COL.LANDA
</b>          I'm just teasing you, fraulein. You
          know me, I tease rough. So who are
          your three handsome escorts?

<b>          BRIDGET
</b>          I'm afraid neither three speak a
          word of German. Their friends of
          mine from Italy. This is a wonderful
          Italian stuntman, Antonio Margheriti.
          (Meaning Aldo)
          A very talented cameraman, Enzo Gorlomi.
          (Meaning Donny)
          And Enzo's camera assistant, Dominick

          The German fraulein turns to the three tuxedo wearing

          After she points out their seats, she turns to leave...

<b>          BACK TO LOBBY

          What are ether of them suppose to do, argue?
          Col.Landa goes over to one of the Nazi GAURD/USHER, and
          whispers in his ear, gesturing toward Aldo. Like he's saying,
          leave the boy alone, till we come back... .Or is he?
          Col.Landa limps Bridget away towards Shosannas office.
          As Aldo stands in the lobby, more and more people enter the
          auditorium, till it's only Aldo and the six Nazi Gaurd/Ushers
          in the now vacant lobby.

<b>          INT - SHOSANNA'S OFFICE - NIGHT

          dominated by a desk.
          They both enter.
          Col.Landa closes the door behind him, and LOCKS IT.
          Bridget notices, but says nothing.
          Now the two Germans are alone.

          Pointing at one lone chair in front of the desk.
          She lowers herself in the chair.
          Instead of moving around to the other side of the desk,
          opposite her. The SS Colonel pulls another little chair over,
          and places it in front of the fraulein.
          He sits. Their knees almost touching.
          The colonel points to the foot not in the cast.

          Patting his lap more with more aggression.
          The nervous fraulein, lifts up her strapy dress shoe enclosed
          foot, and places it in the Colonel's lap.
          The Colonel, very delicately, unfastens the thin straps that
          hold the frauleins shoe on her foot...
          .He removes the shoe...
          .Leaving only the frauleins bare foot...

          .it fits like a glove.

          Von Hammersmarks lily white delicate neck, and with all the
          violence of a Lion in mid-pounce, SQUEEZES with all his MIGHT.
          Bridgets face turns tomato RED, as the VEINS in her face
          BULGE, and her esophagus is CRUSHED in his GRIP.
          With a violent YANK, he JERKS her TO THE FLOOR. She TUMBLES
          out of the chair, Landa never releasing his GRIP around her
          throat. Nov fully on top of her, he BEARS DOWN, SQUEEZING THE
          VERY LIFE OUT OF HER. Every thing he has, he brings to bear on
          the elegant ladies neck.
          Then, to finally finish her off, he begins BANGING THE BACK OF

</b>
<b>          BANG!
</b>
<b>          BANG!
</b>
<b>          BANG?
</b>          She's dead.
          He releases the grip around her throat. His hands are

<b>          TREMBLING...
</b>          He rises.
          Strangling the very life out of somebody with your bear hands,
          is the most violent act a human being can commit.
          Also, only humans strangle, the opposable thumbs being quite
          important part of the endeavor. As Hans Landa stands, the
          sheer violence he had to call on to accomplish this task,
          still surges through him. He tries to gain control of the
          trembling, that is rippling through his body. He takes out a
          silver SS FLASK(filled with peach schnapps), and knocks back
          a couple of swigs. He holds his hand out in front of him. The
          TREMBLING is beginning to subside. He picks up the telephone.

          been waiting along time, to touch you.
          He reaches out with his finger, and lightly touches Aldo's
          face right in the middle of the hood.
          Aldo's head VIOLENTLY FLINCHES.

          In German, he orders the men put Aldo in the back of a truck.
          Aldo, bound, and bagged, is put in the truck. Also in the
          truck is Utivich, wearing a makeshift chauffeurs uniform,
          bound, and bagged like the Lieutenant.
          The Truck drives off.
          Col.Landa turns around, and SEES FROM A DISTANCE, Hitlers
          motorcade pull up to the cinema.. Then the Fuhrer, Goebbels,
          Francesca, and the rest of the entourage, make there way down

          Utivich Cries LOUDER.
          Aldo takes his foot, finds Utivichs foot, and places his foot
          on top.
          The TOUCH has a slight calming effect on Utivich.
          In the darkness, Utivich has reclaimed his dignity.

          see, is a rustic tavern. On the table is one telephone, one
          bottle of Chianti, and three glasses. And on the opposite end
          of the table, sits Colonel Hans Landa.
          A NAZI SOLDIER sits posted at  a impressive looking two way
          radio set up in the tavern.
          Colonel Lands starts in right away at the two baffled,
          discombobulated American soldiers.

          Anything I've done in my guise as a

          They say English words, only adding a "I", or a "A", or a "O",

          auditorium, into the lobby. The Nazi Guards/Ushers are gone,
          the lobby is completely empty. Seeing the STAIRS leading down
          to the WATER CLOSET/BATHROOM, he descends them to plant
          the Boom-a, I mean, The Bomb.

<b>          DESCENDING THE STAIRS
</b>          leading to the Water closet. Like a lot of old cinema's, not

          had to pass through a rather large SMOKING LOUNGE to get to
          it. In the Smoking Lounge are TEN NAZI ENLISTED MEN, the
          Guards/Ushers for the event, smoking and indulging in soldiers
          gossip. They're all in dress uniforms, and all are armed.
          Donowitz, in his tuxedo, acts cool, and walks right through
          them.
          They look up, but don't disturb there time off vibe.
          Donny enters the big Water Closet. Except for ONE LONE NAZI
          ENLISTED MAN at the urinal, it would appear as if
          Donny has the whole wash room to himself.
          He enters the privacy of a toilet stall, locks the door.

<b>          MARCEL IN LOBBY
</b>          He descends the stairs leading down from the projection booth,
          into the empty lobby. He goes to one of the auditorium doors,
          and peers inside.

<b>          WE SEE THE SCREEN AND THE AUDIENCE FROM MARCELS POV:

          the battle rages. He leans over and whispers something in
          Goebbels ear, we can't hear. Goebbels makes a very sympathetic
          face (at least sympathetic for Goebbels), and says in German;

</b>          (Cute whine)
          Come on, it's my premiere.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Are you so use to the Nazi's kissing
          your ass, you've forgotten what the
          word,Ã‚Â°Ã‚Â°No" means? No Fredrick, you
          can't come in here, now go away!
          No subtitles for Fredrick needed this time, he gets it.
          He does a one-armed PILE DRIVE PUSH on the door, knocking both
          it OPEN, and Shosanna back into the room.
          Fredrick, a different cat then we've seen up till now, enters
          the booth, closing the door behind him, and LOCKING it.
          The quite startled Shosanna, says to Fredrick;

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Fredrick, you hurt me.

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          Well, it's nice to know you can feel
          something. Even if it's just physical
          pain.
          Fredrick steps forward...
          Shosanna steps backwards...

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          I'm not a man you say, "Go away"
          to. There's over three hundred
          dead bodies in Russia, that if
          they could, would testify to that.
          After what I've done for you, you

<b>          COL.LANDA'S POV:
</b>          On the ground, looking up at Aldo, bloody knife in hand, who
          straddles him.. And Uitivich, who's next to him. The two
          Basterds admire Aldo's handiwork.

<b>          LT.ALDO
</b>          You know somethin Uitivich, I think
          this just might be my masterpiece.
