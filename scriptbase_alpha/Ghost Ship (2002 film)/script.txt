                              (formerly "CHIMERA")

                                       by

                                  Mark Hanlon

                                  First draft

                

                                    FADE IN

     INT. BARGE - DAY

     Crewman EPPS (29), wearing a life vest and tool belt, jumps 
     down into the darkness. She stands in a great hollow cavern, 
     oily, wet, resonant with the sound of creaking, rusty steel 
     and WATER MOVING OVER ITS HULL on the other side.

     INT. BARGE - LATER - DAY

     Epps comes to a low point in the darkness, shining her light 
     on a lake of salt water sloshing against the bulkhead. She 
     kneels. As the water sloshes back she sees that it is leaking 
     in through the seams in the steel plate of the hull.

     EXT. BARGE - LATER - DAY

     Epps pulls herself onto the deck from below. She stands on a 
     rusting 5000 ton tank barge being pulled in the open ocean 
     by a brawny marine tug at the end of a 150 foot tow cable. 
     It is a typical summer day in the southern Bering Sea, which 
     means a healthy chop and a stiff cold breeze out of the north-
     west.  She closes the hatch behind her and makes her way 
     forward.

     EXT. BARGE - BOW - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

     Up ahead, the tug pulls steadily, grey-black clouds of diesel 
     smoke rising from its massive turbine vents.

     Epps cinches and checks her body harness, focused and 
     professional. The product of a rocky childhood in the Pacific 
     Northwest and a few years of hard living, she's found her 
     true calling now. And under some grime, several polypro shirts 
     and a pair of orange men's Insulite pants she might even be 
     considered pretty.

     She clips her harness into the tow cable where it attaches 
     to a heavy pair of eye cleats at the bow. She climbs onto 
     the cable, hanging out over the water as it breaks on the 
     bow beneath her. She pulls herself forward on a roller bearing 
     that fits over the width of the cable and starts off toward 
     the tug at the other end.

     EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - LATER - DAY

     DODGE and GREER look on from the stern, where the boat's 
     name "Arctic Warrior" is emblazoned on the transom. Dodge 
     (37), scruffy chief engineer, wearing de rigueur greasy 
     coveralls and nicotine stained fingers, is an expatriate 
     Texan and former merchant marine. GREER (42), is the boat's 
     first mate, African American, originally from some sweltering 
     red-neck hellhole, now a tug pilot intentionally well to the 
     north.

     They watch as Epps pulls herself toward them, the cable 
     occasionally dipping a few feet with a spray of water as a 
     passing swell slackens it. Epps pulls herself to the stern 
     where the cable winds into a tow anchor.

                    EPPS
          It's a slow leak.

     She unclips and drops to the deck.

                    GREER
          What's slow?

                    EPPS
          Maybe twenty gallons an hour.

                    DODGE
          Where from?

                    EPPS
          Amidships starboard at the beam.  
          Just under the waterline. I don't 
          think it's a problem.

                    GREER
          Hear that, Dodge? Epps don't think 
          it's a problem.

                    DODGE
          I'll sleep good tonight knowing that.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     The view from the pilothouse commands 360 degrees as radar 
     and GPS navigation displays glow. MURPHY, the ship's master, 
     pilots the boat. He is 48, at sea all his adult life, and 
     most of the rest, a fact written on his face and one that 
     every crewman who's ever worked for him has been willing to 
     bet his life on. A walkie-talkie CRACKLES AWAKE.

                    GREER (V.O. RADIO)
          Greer to Murphy.

                    MURPHY
               (lifting the radio)
          Go.

     Murphy turns back to see Greer, Epps, and Dodge looking up 
     at him from the stern.

                    GREER
          The number nine on the starboard 
          side's half flooded. Epps says it's 
          a slow leak just under the waterline, 
          about twenty gallons an hour. They 
          must've pumped it before we left 
          Sitka.

                    MURPHY
          Of course they did.

                    GREER
          Let the buyer beware.

                    MURPHY
          What do you say, Dodge?

                    DODGE (V.O. RADIO)
               (taking the radio)
          If it started out at twenty an hour 
          the piece of shit'd be at the bottom 
          of the Gulf by now. Whether it'll 
          make St. Lawrence is anybody's guess.

     EXT. OPEN OCEAN - DAY

     HIGH AND WIDE as the Arctic Warrior pulls the barge against 
     the swell of a grey ocean and a darkening sky.

                               DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. PORT GERMAINE - ST. LAWRENCE ISLAND - DAY

     The shores of St. Lawrence Island open into a small port 
     town of mainly pre-fab buildings as the Arctic Warrior 
     approaches with the barge, now pathetically listing to one 
     side as it moves into the harbor.

     EXT. PORT GERMAINE - DOCKS - LATER - DAY

     A smaller harbor tug helps the Arctic Warrior jockey the 
     listing barge to the dock as Epps and Dodge jump off to tie 
     her up.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

     Greer feathers the tug into position and shuts down the 
     turbines.

     EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Murphy jumps down from the pilothouse to the deck as a fat 
     Russian man, Vasili (60) and a MECHANIC in grease-covered 
     orange coveralls approach from the dock.

                    VASILI
          I thought you say Tuesday.

                    MURPHY
          Better late than never.

                    VASILI
               (seeing the listing 
               barge)
          What's this?

                    MURPHY
          You got a leak in the number nine 
          compartment.

                    VASILI
          No, no. You got leak.

                    MURPHY
          You pump it out and re-seam the hull, 
          she'll be good as new.

                    VASILI
          That cost me twenty grand at least.

                    MURPHY
          Fifteen, at the most.

                    VASILI
          Twenty. You knock off twenty and 
          then we see. After my guy looks at 
          it.

     INT. VASILI'S OFFICE - DAY

     In a prefab office with a view of the shipyard, Vasili cuts 
     a check as Murphy and Greer look on. He tears it out of the 
     book, handing it across the desk to Murphy, who inspects it.

                    MURPHY
          You're kidding, right?

                    VASILI
          You want fair pay, make hamburger 
          for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to 
          sign.

     Vasili pushes a transfer register toward him. Murphy signs.

     EXT. SHIPYARD - DAY

     Greer and Murphy walk back toward the dock.

                    GREER
          Not bad for dragging a leaky tub 
          half way to Russia.

                    MURPHY
          He'll sell the scrap for three times 
          what he paid.

                    GREER
          I must be in the wrong business.

                    MURPHY
          You got that right.

                    GREER
               (imitating Vasili)
          Better than "making hamburger for 
          Mickey D."

     INT. BAR - NIGHT

     A typical port town bar. Except this one is on an island in 
     the middle of the Bering Sea. Epps lines up a shot at the 
     pool table as a couple of SEAMEN check out her ass and a 
     tattoo of Wiley Coyote poking out of her pants. Greer reads 
     a paper near-by.

     Murphy enters, crossing to the bar where Dodge nurses a beer 
     and a cigarette. Murphy throws down an envelope with Dodge's 
     name on it. Dodge picks it up, thumbs through a thick stack 
     of hundreds.

                    DODGE
          Much obliged, skipper.

     INT. BAR - LATER - NIGHT

     The place is a little more crowded now as Epps pushes her 
     way through to the bar, a cigarette dangling from her mouth. 
     She buys two beers and pays the BARTENDER from her envelope 
     of cash. She takes the beers back to the far wall where a 
     young off-duty COASTGUARDSMAN stands. He takes one, they 
     laugh.

     AT A TABLE

     Beers, cigarettes and pay envelopes on the table before them, 
     Dodge, Greer and Murphy look on at Epps across the room, who 
     is showing the coastguardsman a birthmark on her neck.

                    GREER
          Looks like Epps' gonna get some 
          tonight.

                    DODGE
          With that coxswain dickhead.

                    MURPHY
          You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?

                    DODGE
          Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps?  
          Gimme a break.

     Greer and Murphy trade looks as Dodge raises his beer.

                    DODGE
          What a laugh.

     A MINOR COMMOTION can be heard as they sit there.

                    WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
          I'll show you, bitch!

     They look over to see the coastguardsman's GIRLFRIEND, late 
     20s, hefty in a red miniskirt and big hair.

                    GIRLFRIEND
          You want to mess with me, I'll kick 
          your bitch ass, girl.

     WITH EPPS

     Epps coolly puts out her cigarette as a circle has gathered 
     around her and the girlfriend, anxious to see a girl fight.

                    EPPS
          I don't know what you're talking 
          about. I just bought this guy a beer.

                    GIRLFRIEND
          This "guy" is my man, honey.

                    COASTGUARDSMAN
          Darlene --

                    GIRLFRIEND
          You, shut up.

                    EPPS
               (starting off)
          Listen, I don't want any trouble, 
          okay -- ?

                    GIRLFRIEND
               (stopping Epps)
          Uh-uh. No. We're gonna fix this right 
          now.

                    MURPHY
               (stepping up)
          What seems to be the trouble, ladies?

                    RIVETER
          Whyn't you mind your own business, 
          chief.

     Murphy turns to see a shipyard RIVETER, a big man holding a 
     beer, still wearing his welding leathers. Murphy turns back 
     to Epps and the Girlfriend.

                    MURPHY
          As I said, what seems to be the 
          trouble?

                    RIVETER
          Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you 
          got your hearing aid turned down?

                    MURPHY
          I heard you. But I'm choosing to 
          ignore you. Epps, let's go.

     Epps starts forward but the Riveter stands in her way, taking 
     Murphy by the collar.

                    RIVETER
          These ladies was having themselves a 
          discussion and you're interrupting 
          it.

                    MURPHY
          You got about two seconds to get 
          your paws off me, Tarzan.

                    RIVETER
          Or what?

     Or WHACK! Murphy can't help but wince as a pool cue breaks 
     in two over the Riveter's head.

     Dodge, cigarette in his mouth, takes a look at the cue half 
     he still holds, shaking his head.

     The Riveter's hands fall from Murphy's collar and his legs 
     buckle. Some of his BUDDIES hold him up as Greer reminds 
     some of the others he's holding a pool cue of his own.

                    MURPHY
          Epps?

     He looks to Epps like let's get the hell out of here. She 
     grabs her coat.

                    COASTGUARDSMAN
          Wait.

     Epps holds there as the Coastguardsman steps up to his 
     girlfriend.

                    COASTGUARDSMAN
          Darlene. It's over.

     He gives her the ring from his finger. Murphy rolls his eyes 
     as the others look on.

                    COASTGUARDSMAN
          I don't love you anymore.

     Darlene breaks into tears as they all look on, some pat her 
     on the back.

                    COASTGUARDSMAN
               (to Epps)
          Come on, Candy. Let's get out of 
          here.

     The Coastguardsman takes her by the hand. Epps looks to Murphy 
     and the others as he leads her out.

     EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

     Murphy, Greer, and Dodge ready the tug to leave as Epps 
     approaches on the dock. She jumps down onto the deck, a spring 
     in her step and a song in her heart.

                    EPPS
          Morning everybody.

                    GREER
          Show your tatoos to that coxswain 
          last night, did you Epps?

                    EPPS
          Showed him a hell of a lot more than 
          that.

                    GREER
          I bet you did.

                    MURPHY
          Candy?

                    EPPS
          It's my pen name.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - DAY

     Murphy throttles up the turbines and backs the tug away from 
     the dock as Greer studies the dawn sky.

                    GREER
          Red sky at night, sailor's delight.

                    MURPHY
          Red sky in morning, sailor take 
          warning.

     EXT. PORT GERMAINE - DOCKS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     As the tug turns into the harbor channel, the sun rising 
     under a cloud bank of brilliant red and orange.

                               DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

     Dodge and Epps play cards at the galley table.

                    DODGE
          Fuck it.

     He puts down his hand. Epps takes another drag from her 
     cigarette, collecting her winnings.

                    EPPS
          One more?

                    DODGE
          Why not.

     She gathers the cards, shuffles.

                    DODGE
          What is your first name?

                    EPPS
          What?

                    DODGE
          It just occurred to me I don't know 
          your first name. All this time and I 
          don't know it.

     She deals the cards in silence.

                    EPPS
               (finally)
          Maureen.

                    DODGE
          What?

                    EPPS
          Maureen.

                    DODGE
          Maureen?

     She looks on at him as he holds there, takes his cards.

                    EPPS
          What's yours?

     Dodge takes a drag from his cigarette, thinking about it.

                    DODGE
          Roger.

                    EPPS
          Roger?

                    DODGE
          Yeah.

     She wants to laugh, but only studies her cards.

                    DODGE
          You think that's funny

                    EPPS
               (lying)
          No.

     She takes a hit from her cigarette as she plays her hand.

     EXT. OPEN OCEAN - BERING SEA - NIGHT

     THE SONG "SOS" BY ABBA BLASTS as the tug plows westward 
     through a steady chop and a mild swell.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - NIGHT

     The MUSIC COMES FROM HERE. Greer has the CD player cranked 
     as he mans the helm in the glow of the pilothouse. He checks 
     the radar, holds there a beat. He turns the MUSIC DOWN and 
     picks up a walkie-talkie.

                    GREER
               (into walkie)
          Greer to Murphy.

     Greer studies the radar display as he waits.

                    MURPHY (V.O. RADIO)
          Yeah.

                    GREER
          There's a large vessel out about ten 
          miles to the north-west.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MASTER'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

     Murphy sits at his desk over the ship's log, holding his 
     radio.

                    GREER
          I been watching it for close to an 
          hour and it hasn't moved. I can't 
          raise it on the radio either. Makes 
          me think it might be in trouble.

                    MURPHY
          Alright. I'll be right up.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - LATER - NIGHT

     CLOSE ON RADAR DISPLAY as the sweep-refresh reveals a bright 
     point of light in the middle of nowhere.

                    MURPHY (O.S.)
          Merchant vessel at position one seven 
          four one five west, five seven seven 
          five north.

     Murphy holds the radio mic as Greer looks on, Epps and Dodge 
     standing back.

                    MURPHY
          This is tugboat Arctic Warrior whiskey 
          alpha sierra bravo four zero niner 
          two. Over.

     Only the quiet hiss of white noise comes back from the radio 
     speaker as the bright point flashes on the radar screen.

                    MURPHY
               (to radio)
          Merchant vessel at one seven four 
          one five west, five seven seven five 
          north, this is tugboat Arctic Warrior 
          whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero 
          niner two. Over.

     Again, only white noise comes back as the point flashes on 
     the screen.

                    MURPHY
          Too deep to anchor out there.

                    GREER
          Looks like it's adrift.

                    EPPS
          Could be a fishing boat.

                    GREER
          Too big. More like a freighter.

                    MURPHY
          What the hell would a freighter be 
          doing up here? It's way out of the 
          lanes. There's not a port for 800 
          miles.

                    DODGE
          Smugglers maybe.

                    GREER
          Smuggling what? Tundra grass?

     A beat as Murphy holds there. He raises the radio mic.

                    MURPHY
          Merchant vessel at position one seven 
          four one five west, five seven seven 
          five north, this is tugboat Arctic 
          Warrior. Do you copy? Over.

     Again, only the quiet hiss of static comes back.

                    GREER
          Call the Coastguard?

                    MURPHY
          Steer to one eight five. Let's check 
          her out.

     EXT. OPEN OCEAN - NIGHT

     The Arctic Warrior cuts a foamy break in the ink black water.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - NIGHT

     CLOSE ON RADAR DISPLAY as the phantom point flashes closer.

     Murphy looks on as Greer pilots, Dodge and Epps watching.

                    MURPHY
          Alright. Back it off.

     Greer throttles back and the boat slows.

                    MURPHY
          Hit the lights.

     EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

     The halogen flood lights flare to life, brilliantly 
     illuminating the water in front of the boat.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

     The four of them look intently into the darkness beyond the 
     light. Murphy reaches for the spot control, sweeping a broad 
     beam of light with a joy stick.

     EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

     As the tug moves along, servo motors sweep the searchlight 
     over the bow of the boat and into the darkness.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

     They peer into the night beyond the boat as it slowly moves, 
     when a shadow looms into view.

                    MURPHY
          Whoa, whoa.

     Greer throttles down all the way and they drift, as the shadow 
     looms bigger before them in the light from the boat.

     As they approach, the shadow appears to be a giant rusting 
     bow, rising up from the water, disappearing in the darkness 
     above them. Murphy sweeps the searchlight to reveal more of 
     what appears to be a large, darkened ship. As they come 
     around, the name "CHIMERA" can be seen above the anchor 
     alleys.

                    MURPHY
          "Chimera."

     Murphy reaches for the mic, hits the LOUD HAILER.

                    MURPHY
          Chimera.

     EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

     The tug is dwarfed by the massive rusting hulk of the Chimera 
     rising above it.

                    MURPHY (O.S. LOUD HAILER)
          This is civilian tugboat Arctic 
          Warrior. Is there anyone aboard?

     The quiet rumble of the tug's turbines is the only sound.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

     Murphy raises the mic again.

                    MURPHY
          Chimera, I am hove to at your port 
          bow. Is there anyone aboard?

     They wait, looking on at the silent, darkened ship under the 
     glare of their lights.

                    MURPHY
          Epps, come with me. You guys sit 
          tight.

     EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - LATER - NIGHT

     Epps and Murphy, in heavy parkas, climb a hydraulic deck 
     crane up to the Chimera as Dodge man's the controls against 
     the movement of the water.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

     Greer holds the tug steady as Epps and Murphy can be seen 
     making their way up under the floodlights.

     EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

     Murphy pulls himself up and jumps down onto the deck. Epps 
     jumps down behind him. Murphy throws his light up on the 
     superstructure. All remnants of paint have been rusted over, 
     lending a still darker ominousness to it.

     EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

     Murphy and Epps move cautiously along, shining their lights 
     as they go. Despite the omnipresent corrosion, everything 
     seems to be in order. The decks are clear and there is no 
     apparent damage. They come to a hatchway. Epps shines her 
     light down the darkened passage. Murphy moves in.

     INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

     Murphy and Epps move down the passageway. Even the walls in 
     here are rusted. They come to a flight of stairs.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

     Greer and Dodge wait. Greer reaches for his radio.

                    GREER
               (into radio)
          Talk to me, skipper.

     After a moment, Murphy comes back on the radio.

                    MURPHY
          We're in a stairwell just under the 
          main superstructure.

     INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

     Murphy and Epps climb the darkened stairway.

                    MURPHY
          This is definitely an old boat, maybe 
          sixty years old. She hasn't been in 
          service for at least twenty years. 
          Probably a lot longer.

     They top the stairs and walk into a wider passageway which 
     takes them into an open area. Their lights shine around them, 
     revealing sinks and counters and racks of old kitchen 
     equipment, a few pots still hanging.

     They move through the galley and into another, narrower, 
     passageway.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

     Greer and Dodge look on.

                    MURPHY
          It's funny.

                    GREER
          How's that?

                    MURPHY
          Besides a little rust, everything's 
          pretty well-preserved.

     Greer and Dodge look at each other.

                    MURPHY
          How she got out here is one hell of 
          a good question.
               (a long beat, then)
          Jesus.

     Dodge and Greer hold there, waiting. Only silence from the 
     other end.

                    GREER
          What is it?

     No answer.

                    GREER
          Murphy.

     No answer.

                    GREER
          Murphy, goddamit.

                    MURPHY
               (finally)
          Sorry.

     Another beat in silence.

                    GREER
          What is it?

     INT. CHIMERA - BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

     Murphy and Epps stand at the top of a stairway, looking over 
     an immense ballroom. Murphy raises his radio.

                    MURPHY
          It's a passenger ship. It's a damn 
          passenger ship.

     Though it is dark, there is enough light to see its ornate 
     opulence, tables and chairs in place near a large dance floor 
     and orchestra well, and a magnificent crystal chandelier 
     hanging over it all.

     EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - FOREDECK - NIGHT

     Epps and Murphy climb down the deck crane as Greer and Dodge 
     meet them at the bottom.

                    MURPHY
               (jumping down)
          There's nobody on that boat.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

     Dodge, Epps, Greer and Murphy sit around the galley table.

                    DODGE
          Probably slipped her moorings, got 
          tangled up in a current.

                    EPPS
          Out here? What, so a seven hundred 
          foot passenger liner drifted out of 
          Spokane harbor and nobody managed to 
          bump into her until now?

                    DODGE
          Somebody's probably looking for her 
          as we speak.

                    MURPHY
          Whatever the reason, she's adrift 
          and abandoned. We've got every right 
          to salvage her.

                    GREER
          You mean tow her back? That's a thirty 
          thousand ton ship you're talking 
          about.

                    MURPHY
          We've done it before.

                    DODGE
          Yeah, from one side of the harbor to 
          the other. But we got half the Bering 
          Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to 
          drag her over.

                    MURPHY
          You have any idea how much a ship 
          like that could be worth in salvage? 
          The fittings alone could go for a 
          few million.

                    DODGE
          If you get it back in one piece.

                    MURPHY
          It's a risk I'm willing to take.

                    GREER
          All we got to do is hit some rough 
          weather and you can forget about it.

                    MURPHY
          So we cut her loose and wait it out. 
          A little weather couldn't be anything 
          she hasn't seen before.

                    DODGE
          It's a bloody navigation hazard.  
          One boat can't control a ship that 
          size.

                    MURPHY
          The damn thing's been floating around 
          for God knows how long and it hasn't 
          hit anything yet. So we take it easy. 
          A little of the old push pull.

     A long beat as they hold there.

                    MURPHY
          Listen. Forget this job's just a pay 
          check for a minute. You know I've 
          been good to you. But I'm prepared 
          to offer you something better now.
               (a beat)
          If we do this right, it's worth a 
          lot of money. A lot of money.

     They hold there looking on at him, waiting.

                    EPPS
          Go on.

                    MURPHY
          Salvage fees on a vessel like this 
          could come in around four million 
          bucks. At least. Who knows, could be 
          more. Could be a lot more.
               (a beat)
          What I'm proposing is... we split it 
          four ways.

     A beat. Dodge looks to Epps and Greer.

                    MURPHY
          Think about it. A million bucks a 
          piece.
               (a beat)
          You want to spend the rest of your 
          days drag-assing tank barges on the 
          gulf coast, fine. Otherwise, let's 
          get to work.

     EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

     The tug is tied up alongside the Chimera, whose dark hull 
     stretches off for seven hundred more feet in the light of 
     day.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - DAY

     Murphy brings up the radio mic as Greer and the others look 
     on.

                    MURPHY

          Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. What 
          type of vessel?

                    COASTGUARD DISPATCHER (V.O. RADIO)

     Murphy looks to the others, almost smiling.

                    MURPHY
          A passenger liner, north island.  
          Over.

     EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - STERN WINCH - DAY

     Dodge, Epps, Murphy and Greer are standing on the stern of 
     the boat under the power winch.

                    DODGE
          Okay. We're gonna use a heavier than 
          usual twin cable rig this time, 
          consisting of a pair of number three 
          gauge braided wire tows.
               (a beat)
          We'll tie off through the anchor 
          alleys. And come down to the aft 
          port and starboard pins. Here.  Thus, 
          we need to get two of these...
               (indicating the cable)
          Up there.

     He indicates the bow of the Chimera.

                    DODGE
          Seeing as though a foot of one of 
          these fuckers weighs about a hundred 
          pounds, it ain't gonna be what you'd 
          call easy.
               (a beat)
          Any questions?

                    EPPS
          Supposing one of those cables breaks 
          under tow.

                    DODGE
          Then we'll all be doomed. Any other 
          questions?

     EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

     Murphy has backed the tug up to the bow of the Chimera. Greer 
     operates the deck crane, one of Dodge's mammoth cables 
     dangling from it down to the winch on the stern.

     WITH EPPS

     Epps hangs on to the top of the crane as it comes to the 
     starboard anchor alley in the bow of the Chimera. Dodge pokes 
     his face out from the other side.

                    DODGE
          Ready?

                    EPPS
          Bring it on, dude.

     Dodge disappears from the hole and his hand comes back with 
     a smaller pilot cable, which Epps takes and threads through 
     the loop at the end of the tow cable. She places the end of 
     the pilot cable in a vice collar and uses a wrench to tighten 
     it down, with the effect of joining the two cables.

                    EPPS
          OK.

     Dodge disappears, pulling up the slack from the pilot cable 
     through the anchor alleys.

                    DODGE (O.S.)
               (finally)
          Hit it!

     Epps reaches over and unhinges the crane hook and the tow 
     cable explosively drops, banging loudly against the Chimera's 
     hull with a shower of black rust.

     EXT. CHIMERA - WITH DODGE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Dodge cranks a portable pulley winch on the deck, the pilot 
     cable slowly pulling the tow cable up through the anchor 
     alley.

     It is heavy and the winch shows the strain as Dodge cranks 
     it. He continues, when something gives in the winch mechanism 
     and the whole thing slides forward on the pilot cable, 
     entangling Dodge's leg and dragging him on his ass along the 
     deck.

     EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     The tow cable creates a spray of rust and smoke as it spills 
     out of the anchor alley before Epps.

     EXT. CHIMERA - WITH DODGE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Dodge slides toward the anchor alley like a piece of meat 
     toward a sausage grinder, when the winch slams into it and 
     stops dead, the cable continuing on with a loud shriek 
     dangerously close to his face, until...

     EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     The last of the cable explosively whips out of the anchor 
     alley in front of Epps and splashes in the water below. A 
     beat as she holds there.

                    EPPS
          Dodge? You alright?

     EXT. CHIMERA - WITH DODGE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Dodge lies tangled in the winch.

                    DODGE
          Yes!

     EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

     Two tow cables extend from the Chimera's anchor alleys down 
     into the water and come up again from the water to the tow 
     anchor on the tug's stern.

     Dodge looks on as Greer and Epps stand by. He raises his 
     walkie.

                    DODGE
          Alright, skipper, real easy.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Murphy slowly throttles up, moving the boat forward. He turns 
     to see as the Chimera drops back behind them.

     EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     The tug moves slowly away from the Chimera as Epps, Greer 
     and Dodge look on.

     WIDE ON TUG AND CHIMERA

     As the tug widens the distance, leaving the Chimera in place.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Murphy holds the helm steady as the Chimera recedes.

                    DODGE
          Steady as she goes.

     EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Dodge, Epps and Greer look on as the tow cables begin to 
     rise in their wake.

                    DODGE
               (into radio)
          Throttle back.

     The tug slows as the cables rise slowly from the water.

                    DODGE
          More.

     The tug slows still more.

                    DODGE
          More.

     It slows still more, until the tug just creeps along, and 
     the massive tow cables rise entirely out of the water, 
     straightening as the slack is pulled out.

     EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Some fifty yards behind the tug, the tow cables come taught 
     in the anchor alleys of the Chimera.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Murphy holds the throttle.

                    DODGE
          Right there, skipper. Right there.

     Murphy eases forward on the throttle and the turbines rise 
     in pitch.

     EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     As the tow cables stretch and the bow of the Chimera inches 
     forward.

     EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     The turbines grow louder as Greer, Epps, and Dodge look on 
     at the Chimera behind them, the massive tow cables bowing 
     under their own weight.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Murphy eases forward on the throttle, picking up speed.

     EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     The giant ship CREAKS AND MOANS as it starts forward, a small 
     bow break forming on its hull.

     EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     The tug is kicking up a foaming wake as it pulls the Chimera 
     along behind it. Dodge lets out a hoot, exchanging high fives 
     with Epps and Greer.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Murphy smiles as he looks back at the Chimera following 
     behind.

     CLOSE ON A CHART. The south Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska. 
     A pencil traces a route.

                    MURPHY (O.S.)
          I figure we go through at the Unimak 
          Pass here. Refuel at Sanak Island.

     Greer looks on from the helm as Murphy, Dodge and Epps stand 
     over the map table.

                    MURPHY
          With a little extra fuel, weather 
          permitting, we should make Sitka in 
          five days without another stop.

                    DODGE
          Sounds reasonable.

                    GREER
          Hypothetically speaking, what if we 
          get this boat to Sitka and find out 
          somebody wants it back?

                    DODGE
          They shoulda thought of that when 
          they let her float away.

                    GREER
          I don't care what, ain't nobody just 
          gonna let us walk away with a ship 
          that size.

                    MURPHY
          The law's on our side. If they want 
          to challenge it, let them try.

                    EPPS
          They must've scuttled it. Nobody 
          just lets a ship float away.

                    DODGE
          Nobody just scuttles a passenger 
          liner either.

                    EPPS
          Ever heard of insurance, big boy?

                    MURPHY
          Either way, we found it. It's ours 
          now -- .

     An EXPLOSIVE THUD shudders the boat. They look to each other.

                    DODGE
               (moving for the door)
          What the...

     EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

     Dodge jumps down from the pilothouse as another LOUD THUMP 
     BLOWS OUT OF THE TURBINE VENTS, SHOWERING OIL OVER THE DECK.

                    DODGE
               (shouting up to the 
               pilothouse)
          ALL STOP! ALL STOP!

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Greer shoves the throttle back.

     EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     The boat goes dead in the water, thick black smoke billowing 
     from the turbine vents.

     EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     as the bow slows in the water, the tow cables coming slack.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Dodge pulls open the door. The place is thick with smoke as 
     he makes his way to the turbine gauges, Epps and Murphy 
     behind. Dodge opens the number one turbine cover, looks 
     inside.

                    DODGE
          Mother fucker!

                    MURPHY
          What is it?

                    DODGE
          Threw a turbine blade.

     Dodge looks over the smoking turbine, pulls back an aluminum 
     intake blade, hot to the touch.

                    DODGE
          Son of a bitch!

     EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - DAY

     Greer, Dodge, Epps, and Murphy confer on the deck.

                    DODGE
          The number one turbine's pretty well 
          trashed. Number two runs, but it's 
          way underpowered.

                    MURPHY
          How long to fix?

                    DODGE
          Hard to say. I gotta get in there 
          and have a look. At least a couple 
          days. Depending.

                    GREER
          You think the extra strain caused 
          it?

                    DODGE
          Nah. Everything was cool. It's just 
          one of those things.

     EXT. CHIMERA - DAY

     The Arctic Warrior floats tied to the side of the Chimera.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - DAY

     Dodge has both turbines opened up as he works.

     INT. CHIMERA - MEZZANINE DECK - DAY

     Lights shine on what was once an elegant interior promenade.  
     Murphy and Greer stand looking on at it.

                    MURPHY
          Some classy tub in it's day, huh?

                    GREER
          Yeah.

                    EPPS (O.S.)
          Check this out.

     AT THE PURSERS DESK

     Epps looks through a file cabinet behind a heavy wood counter 
     as Greer and Murphy approach.

                    EPPS
          Everything's still here. Ticket 
          records, receipts, books of account.

     Greer picks one up.

          James. Dubayy to Halifax. January

          Kirk Line. Nova Scotia.

     INT. CHIMERA - "B" DECK - DAY

     Murphy, Epps, and Greer top a staircase out onto a long, 
     darkened corridor. They move down. Some of the doors are 
     open, faint light from port holes showing small cabins with 
     beds, desks, a few chairs.

     INT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - FORWARD PASSAGE - DAY

     Murphy, Epps, and Greer come to a hatchway marked "BRIDGE."

     INT. CHIMERA - BRIDGE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

     The forward windows show the expanse of the ocean before 
     them and the rusting foredeck about 150 feet below. Light 
     from the windows illuminates the bridge as Murphy, Greer and 
     Epps look around. Despite a little corrosion and a layer of 
     dirt, everything seems in its place.

                    MURPHY
               (looking through 
               scattered charts and 
               papers)
          I'd sure like to get my hands on the 
          general log.

     Epps steps up to the wall, where several framed photos hang.

                    GREER
          That must be the old man right there.

     The uniformed man in the photo is a gaunt, stern-looking man 
     from another century, with dark, hollow eyes.

                    EPPS
          Looks like one hell of a stick up 
          his ass.

                    GREER
          He'd let you off at the nearest port, 
          that's for sure.

     EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - NIGHT

     A dimming purple horizon is giving way to night as the tug 
     floats under the bow of the Chimera.

     EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - NIGHT

     Dodge works up to his elbows in turbine 1 as Greer monitors 
     a pressure gauge.

                    DODGE
          How about now?

                    GREER
          Sixty pounds.

                    DODGE
          What? You sure?

                    GREER
          That's what it says.

                    DODGE
               (geting up to have a 
               look)
          Lemme see.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - NIGHT

     Through the pilothouse windows, the hull of the Chimera 
     disappears into the darkness beyond the tug's work lights.  
     Murphy sits at the chart table as Epps steps in.

                    EPPS
          Coffee?

                    MURPHY
               (sitting up)
          Yeah. Thanks.

     She brings him his cup, seeing the documents he brought back 
     from the Chimera.

                    EPPS
               (taking a seat)
          What'd you find up there?

                    MURPHY
          Some charts. A crew manifest.
               (looking them over)
          Looks like her last voyage was January 
          1953. The question is where the hell's 
          she been since.

                    EPPS
          She was sailing up north, right?

                    MURPHY
          Her destination was Halifax, yeah.

                    EPPS
          Well, suppose she got a little further 
          north than she should have.  Got 
          stuck in the ice. The passengers and 
          crew evacuated. She froze into the 
          ice pack, which moved further north, 
          where it froze in solid. They write 
          it off. Fifty years later, the whole 
          global warming thing happens. The 
          ice melts, she gets loose and floats 
          around til somebody runs into her.

     Murphy nods, considering it.

                    MURPHY
          As reasonable an explanation as any, 
          I guess.

     Epps takes a sip of her coffee as she thinks about it.

                    MURPHY
          Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?

                    EPPS
          Nope.

                    MURPHY
          She was a two-masted brig boat sailing 
          out of New York in 1872.  One day 
          she was sighted off the coast of 
          Portugal by a merchant vessel, the 
          Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei 
          Gratia got closer, they discovered 
          that no one was at the helm of the 
          Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found 
          her completely deserted. The captain, 
          his wife, their daughter, and the 
          entire crew, all gone. The last entry 
          in their log made no mention of any 
          trouble. The table was even set for 
          dinner. And in the nine days after 
          the last entry, she sailed 700 miles 
          without anyone aboard.

                    EPPS
          So what did happen?

                    MURPHY
          Nobody knows. There've been a lot of 
          theories, of course. But we'll never 
          really know for sure.

                    EPPS
          You think she's sailing without a 
          crew?

     Murphy looks out at the Chimera off the bow.

                    MURPHY
          I think we'd be surprised where a 
          drifting ship might wind up with a 
          little wind and the right current.

                    EPPS
          You're more practical than 
          superstitious.

                    MURPHY
          Only way to be.

     Epps nods, takes another sip of coffee, looking on at the 
     rusting hull of the Chimera stretching off in the light.

     EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - DAY

     Greer operates the crane arm as Dodge directs him. The crane 
     hoists out one of the massive turbine fans onto the deck.  
     Dodge gives him the thumbs up as it comes down easily.

                    MURPHY
          What's this?

                    DODGE
          Turbine rotor's shot.

                    MURPHY
          I thought you said it was just a 
          blade.

                    DODGE
          Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace 
          the whole deal.

                    MURPHY
          How much longer's that gonna take?

                    DODGE
          Like I always say --

                    MURPHY
          I know I know, two ways to do anything --

                    DODGE
          The right way and the wrong way.

                    MURPHY
          But how long?

                    DODGE
          Hard to say.

                    MURPHY
          We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A 
          storm blows up and we're history.

                    DODGE
          I'm telling you, you don't want to 
          be running that fan like it is.

                    MURPHY
          What about running number two by 
          itself?

                    DODGE
          It's a full 2500 horses down. We 
          couldn't drag that boat down hill on 
          ice with it.

                    MURPHY
          How long, then?

                    DODGE
          I gotta pull the blades and re-seat 
          everything in a new rotor -- .

                    MURPHY
          How long?

                    DODGE
          Three, four days.

                    MURPHY
          Goddamit, Dodge.

                    DODGE
          What do you want me to tell you, 
          that we can throw this sucker back 
          in and start pulling her like nothing 
          happened? Can't do it, skipper.

          Obviously it's some kind of screw

          hundred percent accurate.

                    DODGE
          Man, it gives me the creeps. We got 
          no business towing a ship that size 
          anyway. I say we fix the turbines 
          and hit the highway.

          Dodge.

                    DODGE
          Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have 
          been lost at sea fifty years ago. 
          You don't think that's just a little 
          freaky?

                    EPPS
          If this thing turns out to be a ship 
          everybody thought sank a long time 
          ago, we just hit the jackpot.

                    DODGE
          Yeah, well how the hell you get 
          something like that wrong? That's a 
          damn big boat. It's either sunk or 
          it ain't.

                    MURPHY
          We all want to get outa here, Dodge. 
          Especially me. With that boat in 
          tow. You got three days.  Make the 
          most of it.

     A beat as Dodge looks back, then out at the Chimera.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MASTER'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

     A pencil point on a map follows across Saudi Arabia, coming 
     to the Persian Gulf and tracing the coast of the Arab Emirates 
     to Dubayy.

     Murphy sits at his desk over the map. His pencil point follows 
     the Persian Gulf from Dubayy, through the straight of Hormuz 
     into the Gulf of Oman. Murphy marks an "X" there. A beat as 
     he looks on at it.

     He opens a large envelope he found aboard the Chimera. He 
     empties it on the desk. He looks through it, docking receipts 
     from various ports of call, bills of lading, etc. He looks 
     over the passenger manifest.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MASTERS QUARTERS - DAY

     Murphy wakes. He lies on his bunk, having fallen asleep last 
     night in his clothes, still holding the envelope and some of 
     the papers inside.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

     Dodge disassembles the turbine fans on deck as Greer reads 
     in the shade of the deck house. Dodge's hand slips and he 
     skins his knuckles.

                    DODGE
          Fucker!

                    GREER
          Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a 
          piece of metal.

                    DODGE
               (inspecting his skinned 
               knuckles)
          Damn mind of it's own.

                    GREER
               (seeing Murphy)
          Morning, skipper.

     Murphy has stepped out into the sunlight.

                    MURPHY
          Morning.

                    GREER
          You're up late.

                    MURPHY
          Guess I must've fallen back to sleep. 
          Where's Epps?

                    DODGE
          Went aboard.

                    MURPHY
          She take a radio?

                    GREER
          Yeah.

     Murphy nods. A beat.

     INT. CHIMERA - PUBLIC ROOM - DAY

     Epps steps from a passageway into a large public room. Tables 
     and chairs are scattered haphazardly, light falling in from 
     windows along the wall where tattered curtains hang. She 
     walks on.

     A pair of empty glasses sit on a table, an empty sherry 
     decanter beside them. An ashtray sits beside that. Epps stops, 
     reaching down. She pulls back a half-smoked cigarette, 
     lipstick smudging the end, yellowing and fragile from time.  
     And, as she stands there, we see a FIGURE, IN MURKY 
     SILHOUETTE, MOVE PAST THE DOORWAY IN THE BACKGROUND. In an 
     instant it is there and gone.

     She puts down the cigarette, having sensed a presence. She 
     turns to the doorway across the room, but there is nothing 
     to be seen now.

     INT. CHIMERA - PUBLIC ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

     A doll's white face, eyes haunting and coldly blue, stares 
     into the middle distance. It lies on a love seat as Epps 
     steps up. She lifts it. Several other toys lie scattered 
     about as she studies it, when the sound of a TICKING CLOCK 
     CAN BE HEARD.

     A beat as Epps holds there. She turns, trying to locate the 
     sound. From across the room, Epps stands, listening. As the 
     TICKING CLOCK sounds from here. She turns, putting down the 
     doll, holding a beat. She approaches, crossing the room, 
     coming finally to a stop before us and what we come to see 
     is an ancient grandfather clock.

     All but it's minute hand has fallen off its corroded face, 
     but from inside it emits a weak though steady TICKING.

     Epps stands there as the clock ticks, looking on, when the 
     TICKING CEASES. A beat as she holds there, as the clock faces 
     her, now silent.

     INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - LATER - DAY

     Epps shines her light in the darkness as she comes to a door 
     where daylight falls from a small port. She looks through 
     it.

     INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

     Epps stands in a white tiled room. Light falls from port 
     holes high in the wall. Running its length is a small swimming 
     pool, it's rusted fixtures and stained surface creating 
     bizarre patterns.

     INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

     Epps comes to a row of changing stalls. Old clothing hangs 
     there, unused for fifty years. A pair of woman's shoes lie 
     on the floor.

     INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - LATER - DAY

     Epps moves along, passing through a doorway into

     INT. CHIMERA - GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Epps enters another room scattered with old exercise equipment 
     circa 1950, a wooden rowing machine, barbells and a medicine 
     ball.

     She steps up to the wall, where pictures hang. The Chimera 
     can be seen in better days, sailing full speed on a calm 
     sea.

     INT. CHIMERA - SUB-DECK - LATER - DAY

     Epps jumps down to a lower deck. She shines her light up to 
     see that she is in an engine compartment, showing a massive 
     diesel burner. She passes through into another compartment 
     where the giant pistons of the ship's power plant rise up to 
     the ceiling.

     INT. CHIMERA - SUB-DECK - PASSAGE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

     Epps moves, passing still more diesel burners, towering over 
     her in the cavernous space. She moves into a narrowing 
     passage, piping and machinery ducts winding their way into 
     the depths of the ship.

     Finally the passage opens into yet another compartment, 
     apparently a cargo hold. Crates and boxes are stacked on 
     loading palettes.

     In the corner, a rotting canvas drape covers something. Epps 
     comes to it. She lifts the canvas, which crumbles away to 
     reveal a 1951 Ferrari sportster. For the exception of a coat 
     of dust and a small amount of corrosion, it is perfectly 
     preserved.

     Mail bags lie in piles along the wall, stacked between more 
     wooden crates and palettes, when something catches Epps' 
     eye.

     A heavy, metal door in the wall is twisted on it's hinges, 
     as though blown back from some terrific explosive force.

     Epps approaches, coming to the twisted door. She shines her 
     light inside.

     A clutter of debris, shelving and wood, are visible in the 
     shadows, when her light catches a glint of something. She 
     swings her light back, revealing a yellowish bright object 
     between broken wood slats.

     Epps steps in. She kneels, shining the light closer. The 
     yellow glint is metal. Epps pulls back a slat, sliding away 
     some of the debris to reveal that it is cast from a kilogram 
     ingot of gold.

     She reaches out. She raises it, completely untouched by the 
     years. She pulls back still more debris, revealing a stack 
     of gold ingots, some having tumbled to the side. She slides 
     away a large trunk that has fallen, pushing off more junk to 
     see that the stack is much larger, perhaps four feet high 
     and five feet across.

     A beat as Epps stands there, looking on at $50,000,000 in 
     gold.

     INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - DAY

     The debris has been cleared away to reveal a clean 5'x 5' x 
     4' stack of gold ingots.

                    DODGE (O.S.)
          What the fuck we gonna do with it?

     Greer, Murphy, Epps, and Dodge all look on.

                    GREER
          What the fuck you think we gonna do 
          with it? It's ours, baby. It's all 
          ours.

     Murphy has stepped forward, taking an ingot, inspecting it.

                    GREER
          How much you figure that's worth, 
          skipper?

                    MURPHY
               (still looking it 
               over)
          Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty 
          million.

                    GREER
          Ho, baby!

                    EPPS
          That's a lot of money for somebody 
          to just let float away.

     Murphy looks up at her from the gold.

                    MURPHY
          Yes, it is.

     A beat as they all hold there.

                    MURPHY
          It's a hell of a lot of money.

                    DODGE
          What, you think there's something 
          funny about it?

                    MURPHY
          A ship with fifty million dollars in 
          gold aboard, adrift? And nobody seems 
          to care enough to come looking for 
          it?

                    GREER
          If they thought it was lost at sea, 
          they probably just wrote it off.

                    MURPHY
          Not for fifty million. An ocean liner 
          maybe. But fifty million in gold, 
          they come looking for.

                    EPPS
          Maybe they didn't want it back.  
          Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.

                    MURPHY
          Maybe. But there's always somebody 
          whose interest's at stake.

                    GREER
          All I gotta say is it looks like 
          that somebody's us right now.

     Greer cackles as he high fives Dodge.

                    EPPS
          And it looks like somebody got here 
          before us too.

     The steel hatch is twisted, as from a great hand ripping it 
     back from the wall.

                    DODGE
               (inspecting it)
          Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell 
          you that. Torn parts rusted bad as 
          the rest of the boat.

                    MURPHY
          Then it happened before they scuttled 
          her.

                    EPPS
          You mean, before she sank.

                    GREER
          Cargo like this could make a crew 
          think twice.

                    MURPHY
          That it could.

     A beat, as they all look on at the gold.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

     After dinner, Murphy, Greer, Dodge and Epps sit around the 
     galley table.

                    GREER
          Then why didn't they take it.

                    EPPS
          Probably didn't have time.

                    DODGE
          Or somebody stopped them.

                    MURPHY
          Either way, they must've had a pretty 
          good reason.

                    GREER
          Must be a damn good reason to jump 
          ship and leave fifty million dollars 
          aboard.

     A beat as they consider it.

                    DODGE
          So what're we gonna do. That's the 
          big question, right?

                    MURPHY
          A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's 
          as valid as a claim to the vessel 
          itself. It's ours.

                    DODGE
          Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy 
          stinking rich.

                    MURPHY
          It looks like it.

     A beat as they let this sink in.

                    GREER
          So what? We gonna unload the gold 
          and get a move on?

                    MURPHY
          We leave it where it is. Stick to 
          the plan.

                    DODGE
          You gotta be kidding? What the hell 
          we need that tub for, we got fifty 
          million bucks?

                    MURPHY
          So we get a little more for the boat. 
          Besides, the gold'll be safer where 
          it is.

                    GREER
          Yeah, but we still gotta haul that 
          big piece of shit all the way back 
          to Sitka.

                    MURPHY
          It's worth the effort. Believe me.  
          Besides we're gonna need her to prove 
          the salvage.

                    EPPS
          Why not call for help?

                    MURPHY
          For now the best thing we can do is 
          to keep quiet about this.

                    DODGE
          Last thing we want is extra partners.

                    EPPS
          Or uninvited guests.

                    GREER
          I heard that.

                    MURPHY
          Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.

                    DODGE
          Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.

                    MURPHY
          The sooner we get under way, the 
          sooner we are to spending what's 
          ours.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - DAY

     Dodge, wearing a welding mask and gloves, braises an aluminum 
     fitting over one of the open turbines.

     INT. CHIMERA - SUB-DECK CARGO COMPARTMENT - DAY

     Epps finishes stacking the gold ingots in a cleared space 
     beyond the twisted hatch.

                    GREER
          Two hundred twenty. Two twenty one.
               (as Epps stacks the 
               last one)
          Two twenty two.

     Greer makes a note.

                    GREER
          Two hundred twenty two kilograms of 
          solid gold.

                    EPPS
          That's what I call a payday.

                    GREER
          Hell yeah.

     They slap hands.

     INT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

     Murphy moves down the darkened passage, coming to a door 
     marked "CAPTAIN." The door is ajar. He pushes it open.

     INT. CHIMERA - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Murphy stands in the doorway of a spacious cabin panelled in 
     dark wood. A large desk occupies a corner of the room by the 
     windows. Though dirty and worn with time, everything is 
     ordered and in its place.

     Murphy comes to the desk. He sits down in the chair behind 
     it. The surface is clear and uncluttered. He pulls out the 
     drawer to reveal pens, writing paper, a ruler, compass and 
     protractor amidst other sundry items.

     INT. CHIMERA - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER - 
     DAY

     Murphy steps in. The room is undisturbed, light falling in 
     on the taught green bedspread through dirty, tattered 
     curtains.  A robe hangs on the back of a chair. A pair of 
     slippers lie beneath it.

     INT. CHIMERA - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER - 
     DAY

     Murphy stands in the bathroom. The tile has yellowed with 
     time, but everything is exactly as it was left. Even the 
     shaving kit is neatly arrayed on the sink as Murphy looks on 
     at it. He looks up, seeing himself in the mirror, when an 
     EXPLOSION SOUNDS.

     EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

     Murphy comes to the railing, looking out over the bow of the 
     ship to see black smoke rising from where the Arctic Warrior 
     is tied.

     EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

     Greer and Epps run to the side to see billowing smoke rising 
     from the Arctic Warrior as Murphy climbs down the crane to 
     the deck.

     EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Murphy jumps down to the deck. Flames belch from an open 
     hatch as Murphy grabs a fire extinguisher from a deck locker, 
     coming to the engine room door.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Murphy enters to find the engine room engulfed in flames and 
     black smoke. He finds Dodge spraying at it with an 
     extinguisher of his own.

     The flames belch up from an oil fire in the turbine well, 
     the heat searing paint on the metal covers. Murphy sprays a 
     cloud of halon and the fire dims, but only for a moment.

     Dodge grabs another extinguisher, his leg burned, face and 
     hands singed.

     An EXPLOSION ROCKS THE BOAT and molten flames hurl through 
     the air, catching Murphy's pant leg. He's so engrossed in 
     fighting the flames, he doesn't realize he's on fire.

                    DODGE
               (over the roar)
          Murphy!

     Murphy looks down to see his pant leg is on fire, as Dodge 
     turns a cloud of halon on him, putting it out.

                    DODGE
          Propane tanks're gonna go!

     Murphy crosses in the smoke, coming as close as he dares to 
     the most intense part of the flames. He turns the extinguisher 
     into them, holding it there.

     The flames dim, as Dodge joins him on the other side, turning 
     his extinguisher on it too. The fire seems to dim yet again 
     as clouds of halon rise up.

     Fire belches from a duct, crawling across the ceiling. Dodge 
     fires his extinguisher at it, pushing it back across to the 
     wall again.

     Murphy extinguishes the last of the flames in the turbine 
     well as Dodge brings a snaking tendril of fire down to the 
     deck, and finally out.

     They stand there in the sudden silence, the air heavy with 
     smoke. A fine layer of halon powder lies over everything, 
     but the fire is out.

     EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - DAY

     Dodge smokes a cigarette, now starting to feel his burned 
     leg, which is oozing as Murphy and Greer look on.

                    DODGE
          One minute I'm minding my own 
          business, the next thing I know the 
          whole place is burning up.
               (taking a drag)
          An oxygen tank must've blown on the 
          welder. Started an oil fire.

                    GREER
          Looks like it took out the backup 
          genny too.

                    MURPHY
          Terrific.

     Epps arrives with a first aid kit.

                    MURPHY
          How's that leg?

     Epps cuts back the burned pant leg to see the burn.

                    DODGE
          Seen better -- Ow!

     Epps cleans the burn with hydrogen peroxide.

                    EPPS
          This's gonna hurt a little.

                    DODGE
          Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!

     Epps keeps cleaning as Dodge bears it.

                    GREER
          What now?

                    MURPHY
          We could call for help.

                    GREER
          And get a bunch of fools sniffin' 
          around here?

                    EPPS
          What other choices have we got?

                    DODGE
          I tell you one thing, we're not gonna 
          be towing no ship now.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

     A gas lantern sits on the map table illuminating Murphy as 
     he holds the radio mic.

                    MURPHY
               (to radio)

          four zero niner two. Over and out.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

     Dodge pours out a few cans of cold chili into a bowl and 
     takes it to the table where Epps, Greer, and Murphy sit under 
     the stark light of a gas lantern.

                    GREER
          Fifty million four ways. That's twelve 
          million and change a piece.  What 
          you gonna do with your share, skipper?

                    MURPHY
          Not much at all, I guess. Retire.  
          Live out my golden years and all 
          that.

                    DODGE
          I'm buyin' me a nice outrigger.  
          Spend my time hauling rich Seattle 
          business men through the Puget.

                    MURPHY
          How about you Epps?

                    EPPS
          Guess I'll just keep working.

                    DODGE
          What're you crazy?

                    EPPS
          I like my job.

                    MURPHY
          Greer?

                    GREER
          Moving to Sweden.

                    DODGE
          What's so great about Sweden?

                    GREER
          It's a beautiful country. Very clean. 
          Very civilized. And cold.

                    EPPS
          That's a good thing?

                    GREER
          Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder 
          the better.

                    DODGE
          Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish 
          girls you only gonna dream about.

                    GREER
          We'll see who's dreamin', m'man.

                    MURPHY
          Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be 
          doing if we don't get this boat 
          running.

                    DODGE
          Yeah, yeah.

     A STRANGE SOUND BEGINS. IT IS LIKE A DISTANT SHRIEKING, AS 
     OF METAL AGAINST METAL, BUT ALMOST HUMAN, DISTANTLY ECHOING.

                    GREER
          What the hell is that?

     The SHRIEKING CONTINUES, ECHOING EERILY AS IF FROM THE SEA.

     EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

     Dodge, Epps, Murphy and Greer emerge on deck.

     The DISTANT SHRIEKING IS LOUDER HERE, BUT SEEMS TO BE 
     EMANATING FROM DEEP IN THE SHIP as they stand facing it on 
     the bow.

                    EPPS
          It's coming from inside.

     They hold there listening as the SHRIEKING CONTINUES.

                    DODGE
          Sounds like the hull.

                    MURPHY
          Warm water current maybe, making the 
          metal expand.

                    GREER
          That shit is seriously bizarre.

     The DISTANT SHRIEKING ECHO continues as they hold there.

     EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - DAY

     The engine room is black with soot, the turbines covered in 
     halon powder. Dodge stands there looking at it. He sighs.

     INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - DAY

     Greer goes through shelves of supplies, finding a stack of 
     sterno cans and warming candles. He throws them into a wooden 
     crate of other supplies he's gathered.

     INT. CHIMERA - FIRST CLASS STATEROOM - DAY

     Epps slowly pushes open the door. She holds a sack with a 
     few items she's managed to scavenge. Light falls from 
     curtained windows onto the room. A divan sits against the 
     wall. A table stands in the middle of the room, a moth-eaten 
     velvet table cloth sitting under a brass lamp on top. Two 
     twin beds stand on either side. They are covered in dust and 
     are moth-eaten, unmade, as if the occupants had just gotten 
     up, fifty years ago.

     In one corner is an armoire. Epps steps up to it, pulling 
     back the door to reveal a rack of woman's clothing hanging 
     there undisturbed.

     INT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

     A pair of slippers lie on the floor beside a chair, over 
     which is draped a woman's robe. Epps lifts it, the material 
     crumbling in her hands.

     INT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

     A drawer comes back to reveal a number of personal affects, 
     a man's billfold, cuff links, tarnished silver cigarette 
     holder and case, coins, black horn-rimmed glasses, pocket 
     watch and fob, and a room key.

     Epps pulls back the billfold. She opens it. Inside she finds 
     a Canadian passport a picture of a dark-haired man with a 
     mustache and black horn-rimmed glasses, circa 1950. In the 
     folds she finds three hundred Canadian dollars. An insert 
     holds pictures, of a suburban home, children, and a woman, 
     presumably his wife.

     INT. CHIMERA - "A" DECK PASSAGE - LATER - DAY

     Epps steps from the room. She turns to close the door, but 
     stops, holding there, strongly sensing something.

     THE CAMERA SLOWLY COMES AROUND TO HER OTHER SIDE, revealing 
     the long passageway behind her, each bulkhead hatchway 
     creating the impression of a tunnel of mirrors that frame 
     one another and, standing at the very end of this tunnel in 
     the foggy light from a porthole, a MAN in dark clothing.

     Epps slowly turns her head to see what she already senses, 
     the man standing at the end of the passageway facing her. A 
     beat as they hold there. The man only stares back at her, 
     then turns to walk away.

                    EPPS
          Hey!

     Epps moves off as the man walks around the corner.

                    EPPS
          Hey, wait a minute! Hey!

     MOVING WITH Epps as she breaks into a run, going down the 
     passageway. She comes to the corner, rounding it out onto 
     another passageway. The man is nowhere to be seen.

     Epps moves quickly down the passageway, coming to the next 
     corner, rounding it out to see only another long passageway.  
     She turns back, running right into Murphy.

                    MURPHY
          Take it easy, you'll live longer.

                    EPPS
          Did you see him?

                    MURPHY
          Who?

                    EPPS
          The guy. He just came this way.

                    MURPHY
          What guy?

                    EPPS
          There's somebody else on this boat.

                    MURPHY
          What? What the hell're you talking 
          about.

                    EPPS
          I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some 
          guy.

                    MURPHY
          Are you sure?

                    EPPS
          Of course I'm sure. I saw him.

                    MURPHY
          You sure it wasn't me?

                    EPPS
          It wasn't you. It was somebody else. 
          There's somebody else aboard.

     A beat as Murphy looks back at her.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

     Greer, Dodge, Murphy, and Epps stand around by lantern light.

                    DODGE
          Light in those passages ain't so 
          good.

                    EPPS
          I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I 
          don't know who it was. But I saw 
          somebody.

                    GREER
          What'd he look like?

                    EPPS
          Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get 
          a good look. He was far away. But I 
          saw him. I saw him as sure as you're 
          standing there.

                    DODGE
          Where's his boat, then? Where's his 
          crew? He ain't gonna be out here by 
          himself, that's for damn sure.

                    GREER
          She's so big somebody could come 
          alongside her on the other side and 
          we'd never know it.

                    EPPS
          Maybe that is his boat.

                    DODGE
          Gimme a break.

     A beat as they sit in silence.

                    MURPHY
          If somebody's aboard her already, 
          she ain't ours. She's theirs.

                    DODGE
          Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam 
          for fifty years. We found her. She's 
          ours.

                    MURPHY
          Not in the eyes of the law.

                    EPPS
          So, we find this guy and make a deal 
          with him.

                    MURPHY
          We don't exactly have the best 
          bargaining position.

                    DODGE
          I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a 
          professional salvage crew going about 
          our business. What's some yahoo doing 
          way out here by himself anyway?

                    MURPHY
          And what do you propose? That we 
          knock this guy off?

                    DODGE
          Why not? Why the fuck not?

     A beat as Murphy, Greer and Epps exchange looks.

                    DODGE
          Fifty million dollars. Fifty million. 
          We gonna let this guy just take it 
          from us? One guy?

                    EPPS
          So we kill him?

                    DODGE
          I'm saying we gotta do whatever we 
          gotta do to preserve our interest.

                    GREER
          I don't know.

                    MURPHY
          Let's just take it easy here, alright? 
          Nobody's gonna kill anybody.

                    GREER
          Supposing he wants to get bad with 
          us?

                    DODGE
          One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.

                    EPPS
          Maybe he isn't alone.

     They consider this a moment.

                    GREER
          I say we off-load some of that gold 
          now.

                    MURPHY
          Would you hold on just a minute here, 
          please? Look, there's no reason to 
          panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine. 
          It's a big boat.  Chances're real 
          good he doesn't even know about the 
          gold. If we stay cool, nobody'll be 
          the wiser.
               (a beat)
          The gold stays where it is til we're 
          ready to go. Like I said, it'll be a 
          hell of a lot safer there than here.

                    DODGE
          What if that fucker finds it before 
          we're ready to go?

                    MURPHY
          We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight 
          off. Low man first.

                    EPPS
          Guess that'd be me. Again.

                    MURPHY
          Dodge, get on that turbine. I don't 
          care if you don't sleep for a week.  
          The sooner you're done, the sooner 
          we can get out of here. How's the 
          food situation?

                    GREER
          Pretty low all around.

                    MURPHY
          We'll have to take it easy then. I 
          don't think we'll find much aboard 
          the ship, but it's probably worth 
          looking around.

                    EPPS
          Say we run into this guy again.

     A beat as they consider this.

                    MURPHY
          If he's reasonable, maybe we can 
          make some kind of deal. If not.  
          We'll have to re-consider our options.

                    DODGE
          Yeah, reconsider fucking his shit 
          up.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - WARD LOCKER - NIGHT

     Epps is dressed in her cold weather gear as she opens a 
     locker, revealing a flare gun and a shotgun. Epps pulls back 
     the shotgun and a box of shells.

     EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - NIGHT

     Murphy and Dodge look on as Epps loads the last of several 
     shotgun shells into the pump action short barrel 12-gauge.  
     She expertly shuttles a round into the chamber with one hand.  
     Dodge takes a hit from his cigarette as Greer crosses from 
     the deck house.

                    DODGE
          Pretty handy with that scatter gun, 
          Epps. You raised on a farm?

                    EPPS
               (setting the safety)
          Seen a lota movies.

                    MURPHY
          No cowboy shit up there, understand?

                    EPPS
          No cowboy shit. Right.

     Greer extends a thermos to Epps.

                    GREER
          Coffee.

                    EPPS
               (pocketing it in her 
               coat)
          You're a pal.

     She checks the squelch on her radio, pockets it too.

                    MURPHY
          Got your light?

                    EPPS
          Yup.

                    DODGE
          Smokes?

                    EPPS
          Oh yeah.

     Her bravado does little to hide her apprehension as she slings 
     the shotgun on her back.

                    EPPS
          See you boys later.
               (to Greer)
          Don't be late, I need my beauty rest.

     She looks up, climbs onto the crane and up toward the darkened 
     ship above them.

     INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

     A flashlight beam cuts through the darkness as Epps 
     approaches. If this place is creepy in the daylight, it is 
     terrifying now. She comes to a ladder and climbs down.

     INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT

     Epps shines her light as she passes through, coming to the 
     cargo hold. She crosses in the darkness, her light catching 
     the tarnished glint of the gold. She comes up to it, stopping 
     there, looking on at it, a perfectly symmetrical fortune.

     She looks around for a place to sit. She drags a palette to 
     the bulkhead, settling in to face the rest of the compartment. 
     She puts her shotgun down beside her and takes out her thermos 
     to pour herself a cup of coffee.

     INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT

     Epps has dozed off when a CLATTERING ECHOES DISTANTLY 
     somewhere in the ship. Epps wakes. It is silent, as she holds 
     there, not sure she heard anything, when a DISTANT BOOMING 
     SOUNDS. She reaches out for the shotgun, intently listening.

     As Epps holds there, another deep BOOMING sounds distantly 
     somewhere. Epps turns, her blood running cold.

     INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

     Epps moves along in the darkness when the DISTANT BOOMING 
     CAN BE HEARD BRIEFLY AGAIN. She stops, holding there, in the 
     silence.

     INT. CHIMERA - SHAFT ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

     Epps jumps down into the shaft alley where the ship's massive 
     propeller shaft hangs suspended above her. Epps moves along.  
     Finally she comes out into...

     INT. CHIMERA - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

     Where the propeller shaft extends into a large turbine. She 
     continues on, past huge rusting diesel burners, disappearing 
     into the darkness above her, when ANOTHER BOOM SOUNDS.

     She turns, shinning her light back from where she came.  
     Nothing moves. Not a sound, but for her breathing and maybe 
     her heart pounding in her chest. ANOTHER BOOM SOUNDS, again 
     echoing distantly in the silence. She shines her light through 
     the line of burners. Nothing moves.

     Epps moves quietly between the burners. She comes to a massive 
     watertight door at the bulkhead. She steps through, finding 
     herself standing between a row of huge oil storage tanks. 
     THE BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN, closer, as suddenly stopping.

     She moves on, cautiously walking between the tanks, holding 
     her light out before her. She comes to the end of the 
     compartment and another bulkhead. The BOOMING SOUNDS, still 
     closer. She turns the light into the recesses, showing rusting 
     machinery and a stack of oil drums.

     She approaches, holding the shotgun up. As she nears, the 
     BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN. She stops. It is coming from here.

     She tenses, raising the shotgun, holding the light as steady 
     as she can manage. The BOOMING SOUNDS YET AGAIN. It is 
     metallic and staccato.

     She stops in the corner beside an oil drum. Several drums 
     have toppled and lie scattered in a pile when a draft stirs 
     her hair. She shines her light up to see that she stands at 
     the bottom of a giant hatchway shaft rising all the way 
     through the ship to the top deck and an echoey breeze that 
     betrays a throughway to the outside.

     The BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN, this time coming from the pile of 
     oil drums. She steps closer, raising the shotgun, ready to 
     fire. A beat as she summons her courage, then reaches out to 
     push a drum with her foot, when A BLUR EXPLODES OUT AT HER.  
     She fires the shotgun and a spray of buckshot glances off 
     the steel bulkhead in a shower of sparks, a flurry of frenetic 
     flapping whizzing by her head as she looks up to see a large 
     albatross flying back up the hatchway shaft toward the top 
     of the ship and freedom.

                    MURPHY
          Murphy to Epps.

     She settles back, exhausted.

                    MURPHY
          Murphy to Epps.

                    EPPS
               (taking her radio)
          Epps.

                    MURPHY
          You just shoot at something?

                    EPPS
          Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid 
          bird.

     She wipes her brow on her sleeve, holding there a moment, 
     when she smells something really awful.

     She steps forward, following the smell, pushing aside the 
     toppled oil drums to see an unidentifiable form in the beam 
     of her flashlight. She steps still closer, training her light 
     on the form to see that it is a human torso.  A large gash 
     runs up its middle and the clothing has been torn by 
     scavenging birds.

     She hesitates, then steps still closer when she steps on 
     something. She starts, then shines the light on the deck in 
     front of her where the body's decaying head looks back with 
     wide, unseeing eyes.

     It takes everything she has just to hold there. She shines 
     her light back to the headless torso.

     She shines her light beyond that, and up, to reveal a bent 
     steam pipe hanging out over the deck, stained with dried 
     blood, a pair of legs dangling from the pipe when, just behind 
     her, a booted foot comes into frame, lightly touching her.

     She spins around to see another body above her. Except this 
     one hangs in one piece, suspended from another bent steam 
     pipe. It has been impaled length-wise on the pipe from rectum 
     to mouth.

     One of its arms has rotted off and lies on the deck below 
     it.  A few feet away, a third body hangs impaled from another 
     bent pipe.

     INT. CHIMERA - ENGINE ROOM - LATER - NIGHT

     A lantern illuminates the impaled bodies and their various 
     rotting parts.

                    GREER (O.S.)
          Ho-ly shit.

                    MURPHY (O.S.)
          Couldn't have happened much more 
          than a month ago.

     Greer, Dodge, and Epps look on as Murphy kneels over the 
     remains of the headless torso.

                    MURPHY
          Bodies're too fresh.

                    DODGE
          Fresh ain't the first word that comes 
          to mind.

     Murphy checks the pockets, finding a wallet. He looks through 
     it.

                    MURPHY
          Greek citizen. Merchant navy.
               (standing)
          Obviously we aren't the first to 
          come across this ship. They probably 
          stumbled across it just like we did.

                    GREER
          And look what happened.

                    DODGE
          Damn barbaric is what it is.

                    MURPHY
          Could be meant as a warning.

                    GREER
          Stay away. Or else.

                    EPPS
          Because of the gold.

                    MURPHY
          That'd be my guess.

                    DODGE
          So whoever did this might still be 
          around.

                    GREER
          Maybe Epps's mystery man had something 
          to do with it.

                    MURPHY
          Maybe.

     A beat as they consider the implications of this.

                    EPPS
          So, what? We report this? Call the 
          Coastguard?

     Another beat as they hold there.

                    DODGE
          Let's not be too hasty.

                    GREER
          Yeah. Hell, what difference does it 
          make if we report it now or later?  
          We call this in now, gonna be 
          Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all 
          over the place.

     A beat as nobody's too sure about this.

                    MURPHY
          Dodge, if this isn't incentive enough 
          to fix that boat, I don't know what 
          is.

                               DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - DAY

     Dodge fires up a compressor, which feebly comes to life, 
     turning over the turbine, then sputtering out in a cloud of 
     smoke.

                    DODGE
          All the seals and gaskets're shot.  
          Anything that was rubber burned up.

     Murphy stands at the doorway, looking on.

                    MURPHY
          Can't you use something else?

                    DODGE
          I might be able to find something on 
          the ship. But it's gonna take time.

                    MURPHY
          Do what you need to do. Just do it 
          fast.

                    DODGE
          Right.

     INT. CHIMERA - CREW QUARTERS - DAY

     Epps sleeps in her bunk.

     INT. CHIMERA - BETWEEN DECKS - DAY

     Dodge and Greer climb down in the darkness.

                    DODGE
          I need lag bolts, especially one 
          inch standard. And sheet metal.  
          Preferably steel, about a sixteenth 
          of an inch. Aluminium, even tin'll 
          do.

                    GREER
          I ain't no mechanic, just so you 
          know.

                    DODGE
          You find anything that even looks 
          like a compressor. I don't care what, 
          grab it.

     INT. CHIMERA - RADIO ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Murphy stands in the cramped room, full of radios and 
     communications equipment. He looks through the shelves and 
     cabinets, when he opens a drawer to find a dusty bound book.  
     He pulls it back, opening it to see that it is a radio call 
     log. He takes a seat, paging through it.

     INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - WITH GREER - LATER - DAY

     Greer works to disassemble a compressor mechanism. He has 
     difficulty getting the right purchase with his wrench, when 
     he slips.

                    GREER
          Dammit!

     A beat as he inspects his hand. In the silence A DISTANT 
     SHRIEK SOUNDS, maybe metal against metal or maybe human, 
     somewhere in the ship. He holds there, listening.

                    GREER
          Dodge?

     He moves on, shinning his light as he goes.

     INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

     Greer moves along in the darkness when he hears THE SHRIEKING 
     AGAIN coming from somewhere in the ship.

                    GREER
          Dodge!

     INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

     Greer walks up a stairway, stepping into a darkened 
     passageway. The SHRIEKING SOUNDS, THIS TIME CLOSER, as it 
     echoes through the ship. He stops, holding there to listen.

     INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

     Greer comes out onto another deck, stopping there. He looks 
     down the passageway a beat, then moves on. He passes through 
     a hatchway in a bulkhead when A MUSIC BOX CAN BE DISTANTLY 
     HEARD. He stops. The song is "DAISY" ("Daisy, Daisy, give me 
     your answer do. I'm half crazy, oh for the love of you.").

     He holds there, listening intently. A door stands open at 
     the other end of the passage. The MUSIC COMES FROM HERE. He 
     moves forward, walking toward the end of the passage, and 
     the light falling from the open door.

     INT. CHIMERA - RADIO ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Murphy pages forward to the last page of the radio call log 
     book.

     On the page his finger runs down the columns of entries, 
     coming to "TRANSMISSION 1 Feb 53 21:34 hrs GMT. Engine trouble 
     notification made to passing vessel 'St. Charles.'"

     His finger moves down to the next entry, coming to: 
     "TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 09:52 hrs GMT. Dead in Water.  
     Notification made to passing vessel 'Normandy.'"

     His finger continues: "TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 14:07 hrs GMT.  
     Captain relieved of command. Notification made to passing 
     vessel 'China Sea.'"

                    MURPHY
          Captain relieved of command.

     He holds there a moment, moving his finger down to the final 
     entry, reading: "TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 21:24 hrs GMT. General 
     SOS."

     He turns the page to see only the words "GOD SAVE US" scrawled 
     in faded red ink. A beat as he holds there, when a CHANNEL 
     OPENS WITH A SHORT BURST ON MURPHY'S RADIO. He looks to it, 
     but there is no response from the other end. Another SHORT 
     BURST AND THE CHANNEL OPENS AGAIN. This time it remains open, 
     but no one says anything on the other end, UNTIL THE CHANNEL 
     CLOSES AGAIN.

     Murphy takes the radio.

                    MURPHY
          This is Murphy. Anybody trying to 
          call me? Over.

     He waits as no response comes, then THE CHANNEL OPENS AGAIN.  
     Only silence from the other end as someone seems to be there, 
     but is not saying anything. Murphy presses the talk button.

                    MURPHY
          Greer? Dodge?

     Again, there is no response, until the CHANNEL OPENS. Murphy 
     holds there as he is answered by silence, WHEN A GRAVELLY, 
     STRANGELY DISTORTED MALE VOICE COMES BACK ON THE RADIO:

                    VOICE (V.O. RADIO)
          "Cock-a-doodle-doo," said the rooster 
          to the crow. "Where are you now? I 
          know, but won't say so."

     Murphy is momentarily stunned. He hits the talk button.

                    MURPHY
          Who is this?

     The RADIO CHANNEL OPENS. Only silence comes back, as if 
     someone were there but not speaking.

                    MURPHY
          Who is this!!

     The CAMERA PUSHES IN AS MURPHY LISTENS.

                    VOICE
          Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
          toy. Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
          toy.

     The CHANNEL CLOSES as the CAMERA STOPS CLOSE ON MURPHY.  
     Murphy squeezes the talk button.

                    MURPHY
          Greer! Dodge!

     Only silence comes back from the radio when A MAN'S BLOOD 
     CURDLING SCREAM sounds from somewhere in the ship.

     INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

     Murphy moves quickly down the passageway when his radio 
     sounds.

                    DODGE
          Dodge to Murphy.

                    MURPHY
               (taking radio)
          Murphy.

                    DODGE
          You better get down here quick, 
          skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.

                    MURPHY
          What is it?

                    DODGE
          I think you better see this for 
          yourself.

     INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY/PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

     Murphy comes down the stairs and into the passageway we saw 
     Greer in earlier. At the end, the light from the cabin falls 
     from the open door as he approaches.

     AT CABIN 400

     As Murphy comes to the door to see Dodge standing in the 
     middle of the cabin.

                    DODGE
          I found him like this.

     Greer is lying supine on the floor. His legs are rigid and 
     his trunk is extended. His arms are flexed and twisted so 
     that the palms are facing away, fingers splayed, wrists 
     quaking over his chest as they fight to touch each other.

     Murphy kneels beside him. Greer's eyelids are half closed, 
     his eyes rolled up into his head. His jaw is clenched, face 
     contorted in a bizarre grimace. And he speaks, uttering 
     nonsense words in harsh expulsions, as though speaking in 
     tongues.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - DAY

     AN EYE - EXTREMELY CLOSE

     As a light shines in it, the pupil is fixed and dilated.

                    EPPS (O.S.)
          Hard to say.

     BACK TO SCENE

     Greer lies unconscious on a bunk, now quiet, no longer seizing 
     as Epps shines a flashlight into his eye, Dodge and Murphy 
     looking on. She turns it off, standing upright.

                    EPPS
          I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a 
          coma.

                    DODGE
          A what?

                    EPPS
          I don't know what else you'd call 
          it. He's breathing on his own, but 
          his pupils are completely blown out. 
          He's totally unresponsive to pain.
               (a beat)
          What happened up there?

                    DODGE
          I heard a scream. When I got there I 
          found him on the floor. He was having 
          some kind of seizure. I didn't see 
          anybody else.

                    MURPHY
          He must've seen something.

     A beat as they consider this.

                    EPPS
          Other than the obvious, there's 
          nothing wrong with him that I can 
          see, not on the outside.

                    DODGE
          Then what the hell happened to him?

     Another beat as they hold there.

                    MURPHY
          Just before I heard him yell there 
          was somebody on the radio.

                    EPPS
          Greer?

                    MURPHY
          I don't know. No. Not Greer.  
          Somebody.

     Another long beat as they think about this.

                    MURPHY
          It was a man's voice. Repeating some 
          sort of children's rhyme. I don't 
          know, it didn't make any sense. You 
          didn't hear it?

                    DODGE
          Not me.

     Another beat as this sinks in.

                    EPPS
               (looking to Greer)
          He needs a doctor.

                    MURPHY
          I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many 
          signal flares you can scrounge up.
               (to Epps, meaning 
               Dodge)
          Keep an eye on him.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

     A gas lantern sits on the map table illuminating Murphy as 
     he holds the radio mic.

     Only the desolate WHITE NOISE OF EMPTY AIR COMES BACK.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

     Greer lies unconscious as Epps looks on at him. The door 
     comes open and Murphy steps in.

                    MURPHY
          How's he doing?

                    EPPS
          Same. Any luck?

                    MURPHY
          No. I'll try again later.

     A beat as they look on at Greer.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

     Murphy and Epps sit at the galley table. Epps reads the log 
     book Murphy found in the radio room.

                    EPPS
               (reading it)
          They're dead in the water that 
          morning. Four hours later the 
          captain's relieved of his command.  
          And that evening they issue a general 
          SOS.

                    MURPHY
          Possibly false. Hence the IMA record 
          of being lost at sea. I don't think 
          mutiny's out of the question here.

                    DODGE
               (taking a seat)
          On a passenger ship in 1953?

                    MURPHY
          If they knew what they were carrying.

                    EPPS
          You're saying they mutinied for the 
          gold?

                    MURPHY
          If they were close enough to shore, 
          they probably figured they could get 
          away in the lifeboats.

                    EPPS
          Only something must've gone wrong.

                    DODGE
          Yeah, way wrong.

     A beat as they consider it.

                    DODGE
          So. I got a question. Just from a, 
          you know, purely technical standpoint. 
          We call the Coastguard.  Coastguard 
          shows up. What exactly is the plan?

                    MURPHY
          How do you mean?

                    DODGE
          Well, they're gonna be asking a lot 
          of questions. About us. About those 
          bodies. About the gold. Seems like 
          we oughta be prepared is all.

                    MURPHY
          I guess the best strategy's just to 
          tell them the truth.

                    DODGE
          Yeah, well. The truth is one thing.  
          When there's more than a few hundred 
          million dollars involved, that's a 
          whole new deal.

                    MURPHY
          What do you propose?

                    DODGE
          For starters, getting that gold off 
          the ship. What they don't know about 
          isn't gonna bother them.

     A beat as Murphy holds there.

                    MURPHY
          There's no way we're gonna hide a 
          few thousand pounds of gold from the 
          Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be 
          safer where it is.

                    DODGE
          With all due respect, skipper.
               (a beat)
          Part of that up there's mine. I'd 
          kinda like to have a little say in 
          what happens to it.

     A beat as Murphy looks on.

                    MURPHY
          Tell you what, Dodge. Once we get 
          back to shore, you can do whatever 
          you want with your share. But until 
          then, the gold stays right where it 
          is.

     Dodge holds there. He looks to Epps a beat, takes a drink of 
     coffee.

     EXT. CHIMERA - DAY

     The sun comes up over a spectacular cloud bank as the Arctic 
     Warrior drifts alongside the Chimera.

     EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

     Murphy crosses to the deck house, climbs the stairs.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Murphy opens the door, stopping dead in his tracks. A beat.  
     He steps forward, crossing to the corner.

     The radio set lies before him, dented in and completely 
     demolished, as if someone had taken a bat to it.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

     Dodge works on one of the turbines when he is grabbed from 
     behind and shoved into the wall. Murphy holds him fast.

                    MURPHY
          Just what the hell do you think you're 
          doing?!

                    DODGE
          I don't know what you're talking 
          about?

                    MURPHY
          I think you know.

                    DODGE
          Maybe you can tell me then.

     Murphy shoves him hard into the wall.

                    MURPHY
          The radio!

                    DODGE
               (not having a clue)
          The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.

     Murphy tightens his grip.

                    DODGE
          Take it easy, willya? What about the 
          radio?!

                    MURPHY
          You smashed it!

                    DODGE
          What?!

                    MURPHY
          Don't lie to me!

                    DODGE
          What the fuck -- ?

                    MURPHY
          You didn't want us calling anybody.  
          Too liable to ruin your big payday.

                    DODGE
          I didn't touch the fucking radio.

     Murphy tightens his grip still more.

                    DODGE
          I didn't touch the fucking radio!
               (a beat)
          Ever occur to you there's somebody 
          else on that boat, skipper?

                    MURPHY
          Conveniently enough for you.

                    DODGE
          Look, I didn't touch it. Alright?

     Murphy holds there a beat longer. He shoves Dodge back letting 
     him go.

                    DODGE
          Jesus.

     Dodge checks his throat as Murphy looks on.

                    EPPS (O.S.)
          Murphy.

     They turn to see Epps in the hatchway.

                    EPPS
          It's Greer.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

     Greer stands at the galley sink finishing off the last of a 
     jug of water as Murphy and the others step in. He turns to 
     see them.

                    GREER
          Never been more thirsty in my life.

                    MURPHY
          Drink up then.

     Greer smiles, raising the jug to drink as the others take a 
     seat, looking on at him.

                    MURPHY
          How're you feeling?

                    GREER
          Lost my sea legs.

                    EPPS
          Any dizziness?

                    GREER
          No.

                    EPPS
          Headache, nausea, lights?

                    GREER
          Lights?

                    EPPS
          Sudden flashes of light.

                    GREER
          I feel fine.

                    DODGE
          What day is it?

                    GREER
          I don't know. Tuesday?

                    DODGE
          Wrong. It's Friday.

                    EPPS
          Try Wednesday.

                    DODGE
          Right. Wednesday.

     A beat as they all hold there. Greer takes a seat.

                    GREER
          What happened?

                    MURPHY
          You don't remember?

                    GREER
          Last thing I remember I was aboard 
          the Chimera. Down somewhere in there 
          scavenging around.

                    MURPHY
          You've been out for about a day.

                    GREER
          Say what?

                    MURPHY
          Dodge found you out cold in one of 
          the cabins.

     Greer only holds there.

                    GREER
          Oh, man.

                    MURPHY
          We heard you scream. Any idea what 
          you might've seen?

                    GREER
          I wish I could tell you. I'd be real 
          interested to know myself.

     Another beat as they hold there, as Greer takes another drink 
     of water.

                    MURPHY
          The ah... the radio's out.

                    EPPS
          What?

                    MURPHY
          Somebody took it out of commission 
          last night.

     A beat as they all hold there.

                    MURPHY
          Smashed it up pretty bad.

                    EPPS
          But, who -- ?

                    DODGE
          The skipper seems to think I did it. 
          That I'm more interested in that 
          gold than my own safety or the safety 
          of my fellow shipmates.

     A beat as they hold there, as Murphy looks back.

                    EPPS
          Did you?

                    DODGE
          Hell no. You think I'm crazy?

     Another beat as they hold there.

                    MURPHY
          Regardless of how it happened, there 
          isn't much of a chance to fix it. 
          The odds of another vessel in range 
          of the walkie-talkies are almost 
          astronomical. So, as of today, we're 
          pretty much on our own out here.

     INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - DAY

     Epps and Murphy, carrying the shotgun, make their way in the 
     ship.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - FIRST MATE'S QUARTERS - DAY

     Greer stops before a mirror to see himself. He finds an 
     aspirin bottle, goes to open it. And as he does so, he sees 
     that his hand is shaking uncontrollably.

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - DAY

     Dodge works over the turbine. He stops, holding there. He 
     looks on at the plugs and wires and hoses. A beat.

     He begins pulling out the hoses and wires, grabbing at them, 
     yanking them loose, breaking them off.

     INT. CHIMERA - RADIO ROOM - DAY

     The chassis comes off an old radio to reveal a dusty 
     assortment of tubes and condensers. Murphy looks on at it.

     WITH EPPS

     A tattered, bound book lies in the refuse of a forgotten 
     corner. Epps picks it up. The cover has been ripped off and 
     the pages are torn. But, as she looks through it, she sees 
     that it is the ship's log.

                    EPPS
          Murphy.

     Murphy steps over as she pages through the log book to the 
     very end. The last pages have been ripped out.

                    EPPS
          Looks like part of the general log.

     Epps points to a page that has been incompletely ripped out.

                    EPPS
          "The crew have gone mad with greed 
          and fight among themselves like wild 
          dogs over fresh kill."

                    MURPHY
          February first.

                    EPPS
          The same day she supposedly went 
          down.

                    MURPHY
          Must not've been the captain's entry. 
          He was probably out of the picture 
          by then.

     Epps continues to read.

                    EPPS
          "Their lacking diligence has 
          undoubtedly caused the collision.  
          Distress calls have been made."

                    MURPHY
          Collision? With what?

                    EPPS
          The page's missing. Then their SOS 
          was real.

                    MURPHY
          But where's the damage?

                    EPPS
          Maybe the other ship took the worst 
          of it.

                    MURPHY
          If it was a ship she hit.

     A beat as they hold there, when his radio CRACKLES TO LIFE.

                    DODGE
          Dodge to Murphy!

     Murphy reaches down for his radio.

                    MURPHY
               (to radio)
          Yeah.

                    DODGE
          You better get down here right now!  
          We're taking water! Big time!

     EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

     Murphy and Epps jump from the deck crane as the tug is 
     starting to list to one side. He crosses to the deck house 
     and the open engine room hatch to see that it is rapidly 
     filling with seawater as Greer and Dodge scramble to set a 
     pump hose over the DIN OF THE PUMPS.

                    MURPHY
          What the hell happened!

                    DODGE
          Turbine chamber on number two must've 
          blown! Took out part of the hull!

                    GREER
          We're not gonna be able to pump it!

                    MURPHY
          Alright. Everybody grab your gear!  
          This' is where we get off!

     EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

     The tug is listing radically to the side, its deck awash 
     with seawater, as Epps, Greer, and Murphy scramble with their 
     gear to the crane.

     Water is starting to pour out of the deckhouse hatch as the 
     towering framework rising over the pilothouse stabs 
     precariously at the bow of the Chimera.

     Murphy stops to shout back at the deckhouse.

                    MURPHY
          Dodge!

     INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Water is starting to pour in as the entire cabin lurches to 
     one side. Dodge wades through toward the door.

     EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Epps pulls herself up onto the deck, Greer following behind, 
     then Murphy.

     Dodge can be seen stepping from the deckhouse on the tug, 
     which now lists at a near 45 degree angle.

     WITH DODGE

     Dodge stumbles toward the bow, slipping on the wet deck. He 
     goes down, sliding into the water that washes over the 
     starboard rail.

     He pulls himself up, using a cleat to push off. A deck locker 
     opens and the contents tumble around him. He struggles to 
     pull himself up to the base of the pilothouse. He climbs up 
     and edges his way toward the bow.

     WITH THE OTHERS

     Epps, Greer and Murphy look on as Dodge climbs up on the 
     skewed deck crane.

     WITH DODGE

     The tug is slowly lurching over as Dodge climbs the crane, 
     the top of which is sweeping away from the Chimera.

     Below, the decks of the tug are swept with seawater as it 
     sinks lower and lower.

     WITH THE OTHERS

     They look on as Dodge climbs toward them, the sinking tug 
     pulling Dodge and the crane away from the ship.

     Greer pulls back a line, tying it into the deck railing.

     WITH DODGE

     As Dodge makes his way up, he's forced to climb onto the 
     other side of the crane to keep from dangling over the water.

     Above, Greer casts a line. It falls near, but out of reach 
     as the swell of the water starts to swing the crane to and 
     fro.  Dodge reaches out for the line again, his hand coming 
     close but not close enough.

     The swell brings the crane toward the boat one last time and 
     Dodge reaches out, his fingers just coming to the line, 
     coaxing it into his grasp. He pulls it back and hangs on, as 
     the crane sways back with the foundering boat.

     The crane falls away from Dodge, leaving him hanging in space 
     by the line from the bow of the Chimera.

     WITH THE OTHERS

     Murphy, Greer and Epps look on as Dodge hangs over the water 
     and the tug as its stern slowly sinks beneath the waves.

     Dodge climbs the line toward the bow railing as the tug rolls 
     still further to port, the pilothouse dipping into the sea, 
     slipping lower and lower.

     WITH DODGE

     As he pulls himself upward, coming to the bottom of the rail 
     well on the Chimera where Murphy reaches out, just short of 
     Dodge's hand.

     A SCREECHING SOUNDS and they turn to see the twin tow cables 
     coming taught against the hull in the anchor alley's of the 
     Chimera as the sinking tug pulls them tight.

     With a CONCUSSIVE STRIKE, one cable is freed, snapping against 
     the Chimera's hull like a giant steel guitar string.  It 
     starts sliding along the hull as the tug drifts, pulling the 
     cable with it, toward Dodge as he dangles in mid air.

     Dodge pulls himself up, reaching for Murphy, but still short.

     A LOUD HISSING SOUNDS and Dodge turns to see misty air 
     escaping from ports and deck vents as the encroaching water 
     forces it out of the tug below decks.

     The tow cable LOUDLY SCRAPES THE HULL in a shower of rust, 
     as Dodge struggles to pull himself up.

     Murphy reaches out as Dodge extends as far as he can, their 
     hands barely reaching.

     The tow cable is a mere few feet away and closing, ready to 
     scrape Dodge into the water or smear him across the hull 
     like a bug on a windshield, when Dodge pulls himself up with 
     everything he's got and Murphy grabs his hand.

     Murphy pulls, lifting Dodge, as Greer grabs Dodge's other 
     hand and they pull him up, the tow cable sweeping by with a 
     SICKENING GRINDING SOUND OF HEAVY STEEL AGAINST STEEL.

     Dodge turns to see the bow of the tug dip below the surface, 
     slowly going under until disappearing with a last exhalation 
     of misty air. The pilothouse is next to go, the last of it 
     slipping into the frothing water, then the crane, finally 
     disappearing altogether into the depths.

     A long beat as they hold there in the sudden silence, phantom 
     bubbles rising to the surface where the tug once stood.

     EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY

     A boot punches through a rotten wood hull.

                    MURPHY (O.S.)
          That just about says it all.

     Greer stands at the bow of a lifeboat suspended from halyards 
     above the deck.

                    GREER
          Rotten stem to stern. Guess you 
          couldn't expect much else.

     Greer jumps down as Murphy, Dodge, and Epps look on.

                    GREER
          We ain't exactly in what you'd call 
          your high traffic neighborhood either.

                    MURPHY
          The coast guard has our last position. 
          They'll send somebody out soon enough. 
          A ship this size you can't exactly 
          miss.

                    EPPS
          It's a good bet they'll be asking a 
          lot of questions when they get here 
          too.

                    MURPHY
          Let 'em ask. This ship's legally 
          ours now.

                    DODGE
          When they find out what it's carrying, 
          they may not be so interested in 
          what's legal.

                    GREER
          Maybe you shoulda thought a that 
          before you scuttled our boat.

     Dodge turns to see Greer. A beat.

                    DODGE
          The turbine blew.

                    GREER
          Lemme see, was that before or after 
          the oil fire?

     A beat. Dodge takes a swing at Greer.

                    MURPHY
               (grabbing Dodge)
          Easy, easy.

     Murphy holds on to Dodge as he will have none of it.

                    GREER
          Gettin' a little hot under the collar, 
          I'd say.

                    MURPHY
          Shut up.

                    GREER
          Must be a little too the truth, eh 
          Dodge?

     Dodge jumps forward again, but Murphy hangs on.

                    MURPHY
          I said, shut the hell up.

     Murphy shoves Dodge back.

                    MURPHY
          Both of you. I don't want to hear it 
          again.

     A beat as Greer and Murphy hold there.

                    MURPHY
          So just stow it. You understand?
               (a beat)
          We don't need this right now.

     EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT

     A fire burns in an oil drum as Epps, Murphy, Dodge and Greer 
     sit around it in silence.

     INT. CHIMERA - 4TH OFFICER'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

     Epps steps in. She shines her light on the room. It is exactly 
     as it was left. She crosses to the bed, shining her light 
     under it. She sits down, trying it.

     INT. CHIMERA - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

     Dodge moves in the darkness, coming to the corner where the 
     stacked gold ingots rest. He looks on at them.

                    MURPHY (O.S.)
          You shouldn't be down here alone.

     Dodge turns to see Murphy standing there.

                    DODGE
          Just wanted to check on our little 
          baby.

     A beat as they look on at the gold.

                    DODGE
          That oughta buy a man pretty much 
          anything he wants.

                    MURPHY
          If money can buy what he wants.

                    DODGE
          I don't figure there's much I want 
          money can't buy.

                    MURPHY
          Then you're a lucky man.

     Murphy tosses the shotgun to Dodge, who catches it.

                    MURPHY
          We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. 
          You're up first.

                    DODGE
          Right.

     Murphy holds there a beat longer, then turns to go, as Dodge 
     looks after him.

     EXT. CHIMERA - DAY

     A grey chop gently rocks the Chimera, smoke rising from the 
     top deck.

     EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY

     Greer and Dodge tend the flames of three fire barrels, adding 
     broken up furniture to create heavy signal smoke.

     INT. CHIMERA - PANTRY - DAY

     Murphy moves through the pantry area with a pillow case, 
     scavenging for food.

     INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - DAY

     Epps scavenges for food in the semi-darkness of the large, 
     open galley, when a MOVEMENT CAN BE HEARD SOMEWHERE BEYOND 
     THE ENTRY separating the galley from the outer passageway.

                    EPPS
          Murphy?

     No one answers. She looks off across the stillness of the 
     galley. Nothing.

     INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

     Epps steps into the passageway. Directly across is the entry 
     to the swimming pool. She walks on.

     INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - DAY

     Epps steps in. Light falls in from the dirty port holes at 
     the ceiling, every movement echoing off the hard tile walls.  
     She holds there a beat, then turns to go when she sees a 
     GIRL of about 16 facing her on the other side of the pool.

     Epps holds there, as the girl only looks back. She is 
     porcelain white, flaxen hair drawn behind her head, her 
     clothing hanging loosely from a frail body.

                    GIRL
          You must leave.

     A beat as Epps stands there.

                    EPPS
               (finally)
          Who are you?

     From this distance and in the light it is hard to fully 
     discern the girl's features.

                    GIRL
          There's great evil here, more than 
          you can know. Leave now or you may 
          never leave.

                    EPPS
          But --

     A HATCH CLOSES SOMEWHERE IN THE SHIP. Epps turns to look.  
     When she turns back the girl is gone. A quiet "TICK" SOUND 
     ECHOES in the pool. She looks down to see that the pool is 
     now very, very deep, like a mine shaft falling away into the 
     depths. And, as she stands there, dark water is quickly rising 
     up from the bottom.

     She steps back as the water gradually fills the pool to the 
     top. It is very dark and the bottom is indiscernible, when 
     the water begins to churn, as from bubbles of air reaching 
     the surface. Epps steps closer, looking on as a faint red 
     glow can be seen deep in the water below the churning bubbles.

     As she watches, the red glow grows in intensity. The glow 
     spreads, illuminating a broad area until it becomes clear 
     that the water is not water at all but blood.

     And, as the light grows still brighter, a figure is 
     illuminated, well below the surface as it seems to rise up.  
     Epps looks on as the figure rises higher into the light. It 
     is a MAN, fighting desperately to reach the surface. The 
     bubbles that rise up are produced from his silent screams.

     Epps starts forward, but another figure rises to the same 
     point, a WOMAN, also struggling. Another MAN floats up, then 
     another, and another, people floating up, fighting desperately 
     to reach the surface, unable to do so, drowning in blood.

                    EPPS
          My God....

     Epps reaches out over the edge, plunging her hand into the 
     blood, reaching for the man's hand, but they are too far 
     apart.

     She struggles desperately as the man fights to get to the 
     surface.

     The others are fighting for the surface too, as Epps reaches 
     out, near tears, helpless to do anything.

                    EPPS
          No!!

     Everything suddenly stops. A beat as Epps only holds there.

     The blood is gone, as are the people. The pool is back to 
     its normal state as though nothing had happened, Epps looking 
     on in disbelief.

                    MURPHY (O.S.)
          You okay?

     Epps looks up to see Murphy standing at the door.

                    EPPS
          Yeah.
               (looking back to the 
               pool)
          Yeah, fine.

     A beat as she holds there, looking on at the pool.

     EXT. CHIMERA - FOREWARD DECK - NIGHT

     Greer, Murphy, Dodge, and Epps sit on deck around the fire.

                    DODGE
          You'd think on a ship this size 
          there'd be something left to eat.

                    GREER
          After fifty years there ain't nothin' 
          left but shoe leather.

                    MURPHY
          Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find 
          some line and tackle. Use some of 
          those bodies below decks for bait.

                    DODGE
          There's a charming thought.

                    GREER
          We can always start shooting birds.

     Epps coaxes a hit out of her last cigarette.

                    DODGE
          What say, Epps? You up for some 
          roasted albatross?

                    EPPS
               (snuffing it out)
          Why not?

     INT. CHIMERA - 1ST OFFICER'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

     The SOUND OF SOMEONE BREATHING HARD CAN BE HEARD in the dark 
     room. As the CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES INTO THE ROOM, we see that 
     it is Greer, lying on the bed. His body is tense and his 
     arms arch rigidly toward his chest. His jaw is clenched and 
     he expels harsh, guttural utterances, experiencing something 
     between a night terror and a seizure.

     INT. CHIMERA - WHEELHOUSE - DAY

     Sheets of rain come down on the deck in the grey light of 
     morning. Murphy stands on the bridge, looking off at it coming 
     down when Greer steps in.

                    GREER
          Looks like we're in a strong current.
               (closing the door)
          Must be making almost five knots 
          full on ass backwards.

     Greer crosses to the window, stepping up.

                    GREER
          Nasty little swell outa the north 
          west too.

     Murphy nods as he looks out.

                    MURPHY
          Let's just hope somebody sees us 
          first out here.

     INT. CHIMERA - PURSERS OFFICE - DAY

     A file drawer comes open, revealing ticket receipts.

     Epps looks on at it. The receipts are labeled "FULL FARE 
     PASSAGES" and are divided by first, second, and third class.  
     She goes through them, coming to a section that says 
     "ACCOMPANIED CHILDREN."

     She pulls out the folder, laying it on the counter, opening 
     it. The first page is a receipt for a single passage to 
     Halifax for a Tatterly, Stephen age: 14. She pulls it back 
     to reveal another, Wilson, Harold age: 4. Another, Vitti, 
     Angela age: 17.

     She pages through the stack, looking at the ages: 3, 15, 6, 
     11, 1, until coming across a 9. She looks to the name, Klein, 
     David, a boy. She continues paging through the receipts coming 
     to another 9. She stops, looking to the name, Nichols, 
     Katherine age: 16. A girl. She looks to the cabin assignment: 
     "400." She notes that it is the same cabin where Greer was 
     found, when a REVERBERANT CONCUSSION SOUNDS THROUGH THE SHIP.

     EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Dodge runs to the side to see a 15 feet wide by 40 feet tall 
     steel and concrete mid-ocean buoy bounce off the transom as 
     the ship drifts into it.

     WITH GREER AND MURPHY

     They come to the side at the wheelhouse, seeing the bright 
     orange letters "NOAA" emblazoned on the buoy's float pod as 
     the ship drifts by.

                    MURPHY
          It's a Noaa buoy.

                    GREER
          A what?

                    MURPHY
          Government weather. It's got a 
          transmitter aboard.

     EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

     Dodge quickly ties a loop in a coil of docking line as Greer, 
     Epps, and Murphy look on at the approaching buoy.

                    MURPHY
          Let's go, let's go, let's go.

     Dodge finishes as Epps ties the other end off to a cleat.

     ON THE BUOY

     As it drifts along the side of the Chimera. Murphy drops the 
     line down, the buoy bouncing on the swell.

     BACK TO SCENE

     Murphy pulls the loop up as the buoy nears, aiming to hook 
     it on its wind gauge.

     ON THE BUOY

     The buoy approaches, rising and falling with the swell.

     BACK TO SCENE

     Murphy corrects.

                    EPPS
          Higher. You're gonna miss it.

     Murphy holds the loop steady.

     ON THE BUOY

     The loop is too low. It's going to miss the mark as the buoy 
     drifts toward it, when the swell drops and the buoy goes 
     down.

     BACK TO SCENE

     Murphy yanks on the line.

     ON THE BUOY

     And the loop catches on the wind gauge.

     BACK TO SCENE

     As the line goes taught he pulls his hands away just in time, 
     the line snapping hard against the rail. Below, the buoy 
     heels over as it's pulled.

     ON THE BUOY

     It drops with the swell, the line stretching, then swinging 
     the giant concrete buoy float into the side of the hull with 
     a huge BOOMING CLANG.

     BACK TO SCENE

     The line is smoking with the friction, the steel railing 
     bowing a little with the weight as they look on.

                    GREER
          We're still drifting.

                    MURPHY
          The mooring hasn't come taught.

                    EPPS
          It's not gonna hold us.

                    MURPHY
          Doesn't matter.

     ON THE BUOY

     As the buoy falls again with a swell and slams into the side 
     of the ship. The water returns, lifting it high.

     The ship is dragging it back and it begins to rise up as its 
     mooring comes taught. The line rises with it and soon the 
     buoy is at a steep angle as it comes out of the water.

     BACK TO SCENE

     The buoy is held fast between the docking line and its own 
     mooring.

     ON THE BUOY

     The buoy rises fully from the water, all three tons of it, 
     and as it does, the wind gauge's steel mount begins to bend.

     BACK TO SCENE

     As they watch the buoy suspended over the water between the 
     creaking docking line and its own underwater mooring cable.

                    DODGE
          No fucking way.

     ON THE BUOY

     The gauge mount snaps and the docking line flails free, 
     sending the buoy hurtling back into the water in a curtain 
     of spray, whipping wildly from side to side.

     BACK TO SCENE

     The buoy swings back and forth as it rights itself, rising 
     on a swell, passing beyond the bow of the Chimera.

                    MURPHY
          Damn it.

     They look on in silence, the buoy slowly receding as the 
     ship drifts away.

     EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT

     Murphy stands watch by the fire as Epps joins him.

                    EPPS
          Hey.

                    MURPHY
          Hey.

                    EPPS
          Couldn't sleep.

                    MURPHY
          Wish I could say the same.

     They watch the fire in silence for a moment.

                    EPPS
          What do you think happened on this 
          boat?

                    MURPHY
          I guess that's the sixty four thousand 
          dollar question, isn't it?

                    EPPS
          The what?

                    MURPHY
          Never mind. Before your time.
               (a beat)
          I think at least some of the crew 
          went a little nuts. The usual stuff 
          that happens when people stumble on 
          a fortune. Equal parts greed and 
          paranoia, usually resulting in 
          homicide. What happened after that 
          is anybody's guess. But, judging by 
          our Greek friends down below, it 
          doesn't look like the last time.

                    EPPS
          Are we smart enough to avoid that?

                    MURPHY
          I don't know, are we?

     A beat as she looks back at him. She looks back to the fire, 
     watching it.

                    EPPS
          When you found me yesterday, at the 
          pool. I'd seen... something.  Someone.

                    MURPHY
          Not our mystery guest again.

                    EPPS
          No. Someone else. A girl.
               (hesitating, a beat)
          I'm not sure she was... real.

     She looks up to Murphy.

                    MURPHY
          Not real?

     A beat as she only looks back.

                    MURPHY
          What, like some kind of ghost?

                    EPPS
          I don't know what else you'd call 
          her. One second she was there, the 
          next she was gone.

     Another beat as he looks on at her.

                    EPPS
          And I had a kind of hallucination.
               (a beat)
          There were others. I saw them in the 
          pool. Drowning.

     A beat as Murphy looks back, as she sees him.

                    EPPS
          Maybe hallucination is the wrong 
          word. It was more than that. As though 
          they were showing me.

                    MURPHY
          Showing you what?

                    EPPS
          What happened.

                    MURPHY
          Maybe it was one of them did the 
          handy work on those Greeks.

                    EPPS
          No. I think they are, were, just 
          passengers. Innocent victims.

                    MURPHY
          Victims of what?

                    EPPS
          Something bad happened here, Murphy.

                    MURPHY
          That much I think we've already 
          established.

                    EPPS
          More than just a mutiny. More than 
          just the gold.

     A beat as he holds there.

                    EPPS
          She said the ship was evil. That we 
          had to leave right away. That if we 
          didn't, we might never leave.

                    MURPHY
          What's that supposed to mean?

                    EPPS
          I don't know.

     A beat as she looks back.

                    MURPHY
          Why you? How come the rest of us 
          haven't seen these people?

                    EPPS
          Just lucky I guess.

     Another beat as he holds on her.

                    MURPHY
          Well. Getting off this ship's exactly 
          what we're trying to do.  Short of 
          that, I don't know what else to tell 
          you.

     She only looks back at him, then into the fire.

                    MURPHY
          Do me a favor and wake up Dodge.  
          He's next on.

     She starts to get up.

                    MURPHY
          And Epps?

     She stands, looking back at him.

                    MURPHY
          You can tell the others about this.  
          But, for my money, I think it's best 
          you keep it to yourself.

     She holds there a beat longer, then turns, walking off.

     INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - LATER - DAY

     Epps comes to the 2nd officer's door, knocks.

                    EPPS
          Dodge.
               (no answer, knocking 
               again)
          Dodge.

                    DODGE (O.S.)
               (finally, from inside)
          What?

                    EPPS
          Get up.

                    DODGE (O.S.)
          Yeah, yeah.

     INT. CHIMERA - 4TH OFFICERS ROOM - NIGHT

     Epps sits down on the bed. She lies back, not sleepy. A beat 
     as she holds there in the darkness.

     EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT

     Murphy still sits by the fire as Dodge groggily approaches 
     from the officers quarters, carrying a blanket and a jug of 
     water.

                    MURPHY
          You're late.

                    DODGE
          Sorry.

                    MURPHY
               (handing him the 
               shotgun)
          Don't fall asleep.

                    DODGE
               (laying out his blanket)
          Right.

     INT. CHIMERA - 1ST OFFICER'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

     Greer lies asleep on the bed. But his sleep is fitful, 
     increasingly agitated, tormented. It is as if he tries to 
     speak, but cannot. As THE CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN, his words 
     are forced and garbled, speaking in the same nonsensical 
     language he spoke earlier, when he wakes with a start.

     EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT

     Dodge dozes, cradling the shotgun in his arms, when MUSIC 
     CAN BE HEARD VERY DISTANTLY. Dodge wakes. It is "Daisy" 
     playing on a music box somewhere in the ship.

     INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

     Dodge moves along as the MUSIC BOX DISTANTLY CONTINUES.

     INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY/PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

     Dodge moves cautiously down the stairway into another 
     passageway.

     He approaches from the other end. He passes the open doors 
     of stateroom after stateroom. The MUSIC BOX IS CLOSER HERE. 
     It stops.

     He holds there in the darkness. He turns, shining his light 
     back down the passageway. A beat. It is silent, when the 
     CHANNEL OF HIS RADIO OPENS WITH A SHORT BURST.

     He raises his radio. But no one says anything, the CHANNEL 
     REMAINING OPEN, a discernible presence on the other end.

                    DODGE
          Dodge.

     SOMEONE'S POV - FROM THE FAR END

     SLOWLY MOVING TOWARD DODGE as he can be seen from the other 
     end of the passageway.

     BACK TO SCENE

     He gets no response, then presses the talk button.

                    DODGE
          This is Dodge. Over.

     He is answered by silence, the CHANNEL REMAINING OPEN, WHEN 
     THE GRAVELLY DISTORTED VOICE THAT MURPHY HEARD COMES BACK ON 
     THE RADIO:

                    VOICE
          "Cock-a-doodle-doo," said the rooster 
          to the crow. "Where are you now? I 
          know but won't say so."

     Dodge hits the talk button.

                    DODGE
          Who is this?

     The RADIO CHANNEL OPENS, but only silence comes back.

                    DODGE
          Identify yourself, motherfucker!

     SOMEONE'S POV - FROM THE FAR END

     SLOWLY MOVING TOWARD DODGE as he can be seen from the far 
     end of the passageway.

     BACK TO SCENE

     Only silence returns on the radio as Dodge holds there, then:

                    VOICE
          Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
          toy.

     THE CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN ON DODGE as he listens.

                    VOICE
          Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle toy --
          .

     Dodge senses something behind him. He turns, and before he 
     can draw a breath to shout, SOMETHING HEAVY SLAMS INTO HIM 
     IN THE DARKNESS, his flashlight tumbling away in a squiggle 
     of light.

     ON SHOTGUN

     As the shotgun clatters to the deck, the muzzle resting in 
     frame as the radio falls a few feet away. A beat. The shotgun 
     muzzle slides out of frame as some unseen person or thing 
     pulls it away.

     EXT. CHIMERA - DAY

     A grey overcast stretches to the horizon.

     EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - DAY

     Murphy comes out onto the deck. Dodge is nowhere to be seen.

                    MURPHY
          Dodge?

     INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY STORAGE COMPARTMENT - DAY

     Epps shines her light on something.

                    EPPS
          Check it out.

     Greer raises his light to reveal rows of canned goods. They 
     are industrial sized cans, from the 1950s. Greer takes one.

                    GREER
          I don't even want to know what that's 
          gonna taste like now.

                    EPPS
          Better than starving to death.

     Epps' radio CRACKLES AWAKE.

                    MURPHY
          Murphy to Epps.

                    EPPS
               (raising the radio)
          Epps, over.

                    MURPHY
          Either of you seen Dodge?

     She looks to Greer who shakes his head.

                    EPPS
          Nope.

                    MURPHY
          He's not on deck and I can't raise 
          him on the radio.

     EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - LATER - DAY

     Dodge's stuff is laid out under the shelter of a vent duct 
     as Greer, Epps, and Murphy stand over it. A blanket, a pillow 
     and a plastic jug of water are all that remain.

                    MURPHY
          He took the shotgun and a light.

                    GREER
          Must've heard something below deck 
          and went down to check it out.

     A beat as they hold there.

                    MURPHY
          Alright. We stay together. Nobody 
          goes any further than earshot.

     INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - DAY

     Greer and Epps move along as Murphy raises his radio.

                    MURPHY
               (into radio)
          Murphy to Dodge. Murphy to Dodge.  
          Over.

     INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Dodge's radio lies in the detritus of the ship as Murphy's 
     voice can be heard on it.

                    MURPHY
          Murphy to Dodge. Do you copy? Over.

     INT. CHIMERA - ENGINEERING - LATER - DAY

     Epps moves cautiously along in the darkness.

                    MURPHY (O.S.)
          Epps? You there?

                    EPPS
          Right here.

     WITH MURPHY

     As he moves along as well, eyes open.

                    MURPHY
          Greer?

     WITH GREER

     As Greer moves along too.

                    GREER
          Yeah, yeah.

     INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - LATER - DAY

     Epps jumps down, shining her light over machinery and across 
     bulkheads when a WHISPERING CAN BE HEARD somewhere. She holds 
     there, listening. It is echoey, distant.

                    EPPS
          Murphy?

     No response as Epps holds there. The WHISPERING SOUNDS AGAIN, 
     far off, unintelligible. It stops.

     She moves on, shinning her light.

     INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

     Epps moves along in the darkness, holding the flashlight 
     before her, when the WHISPERING SOUNDS AGAIN.

     Epps stops, holding there in the silence. She reaches for 
     her radio. The WHISPERING SOUNDS AGAIN. Epps turns to pinpoint 
     it, coming from somewhere in the cavernous space.

     INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

     Epps passes under a catwalk. She moves on, passing a row of 
     standpipes. Epps stops, listening. Somewhere, the WHISPERING 
     CAN BE HEARD, then stops.

     It is absolutely silent. In the darkness behind her, the 
     GIRL (KATIE) PULLS BACK INTO THE SHADOWS.

     Epps holds there a beat, then turns, running into Greer with 
     a start.

                    GREER
          Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.

     She holds there a beat, looking around.

                    GREER
          You okay?

                    EPPS
          Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard 
          something is all.

                    GREER
          What?

                    EPPS
          Nothing. Let's get outa here.

     They start to leave, when Epps notices something. She stops.

     Beyond the standpipes, a faint glow can be seen in the 
     darkness. Epps steps forward, crossing to it. Greer follows.

     MOVING WITH EPPS

     As Epps approaches, Greer behind her. The light is dim and 
     low to the deck. She stops.

     WITH THE LIGHT

     As Epps starts toward it again. She and Greer come up to it, 
     stopping there. She kneels, the dim glow shining on her. She 
     reaches out toward it, pulling back Dodge's flashlight, still 
     on.

     She turns it off, standing. She shines her light into the 
     darkness and starts off, Greer following.

     INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

     Epps and Greer move along, shining their lights as they go, 
     when something catches in the beam of Epps' flashlight.

     It is Dodge's radio. They stop over it. Epps picks it up, 
     inspecting it. She looks to Greer, when a single dark spot 
     appears on Epps' cheek. It begins to run, a crimson tear.

     She raises her hand to touch it, inspecting her finger to 
     see that it is blood.

     She looks to Greer. They both look up to see, hanging 
     suspended above them, Dodge's face staring back down at them 
     from the darkness.

     He has been imperfectly impaled, the sharp point of a high 
     pressure steam pipe protruding from his neck, head hanging 
     limp beside it.

     INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - LATER - DAY

     Greer and Murphy lower Dodge's body on a rope as Epps guides 
     it to the deck. They stand looking on at it a moment.

                    GREER
          Can't find the shotgun.

                    MURPHY
          So whoever did this now has our 
          shotgun.

                    GREER
          Doesn't look like it much matters.

                    EPPS
          What do we do with him?

                    MURPHY
          Leave him till we can get some help.
               (a beat)
          From now on, nobody comes down here.

                    GREER
          What about the gold?

                    MURPHY
          Leave it.

                    GREER
          Now hold up just a minute. Let's be 
          reasonable here.

                    MURPHY
          You think whoever did this is 
          reasonable?

                    GREER
          All I'm saying is that gold's worth 
          a lot more to us now than it ever 
          was.

                    EPPS
          I can't believe you. Dodge's dead 
          and all you can think about is cashing 
          in your share.

                    GREER
          I didn't sign up to go home empty 
          handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll 
          over for the freaky motherfucker did 
          this.

                    MURPHY
          Nobody's going anywhere with that 
          gold now. Anybody tries to board, 
          we'll know about it.
               (a beat)
          You can do what you want, Greer.  
          But neither of us is gonna risk saving 
          your ass down here if it comes to 
          that.

                    GREER
          Fine with me.

     INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

     Epps enters the dim passageway from the bright daylight. She 
     moves down the passage, coming finally to the stateroom where 
     Greer was found, room 400.

     She holds there a beat, then reaches for the door, hesitating. 
     She opens it.

     INT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     The door comes open and Epps steps in. It is dark, though 
     spacious. It is divided into two rooms. Beyond the sitting 
     room in the front, is a bedroom.

     Epps steps in. A dressing table sits against the far wall.

     A large bed is unmade. Suitcases lie open on stands at the 
     foot of the bed, still half full as if they were in the 
     process of being unpacked.

     From one, she pulls back a woman's gown, a blouse. The other 
     contains shirts, trousers, socks, and underwear.

     Across the room a smaller suitcase can be seen lying open on 
     an Ottoman in the corner. Epps crosses to it. She finds a 
     few shirts, and a red print dress, some books. She takes one 
     of the books, opening it.

     Inscribed on the inside of the cover is: "This book belongs 
     to:" and then written in by hand: "Katie Nichols."

     A page is marked with a purple ribbon. She opens it to see a 
     children's poem "The Rooster and the Crow" and a drawing of 
     a rooster and a crow and a stanza of a poem: "'Cock-a-doodle 
     doo,' said the rooster to the crow. 'Where are you now? I 
     know, but won't say so.'" She puts it down. A tin penny 
     whistle sits on the table. She picks it up, examining it.

     She opens a small picture book, thumbing through to see photos 
     of a family, a young mother and father at the beach, the 
     mother and a girl of about 9 years, the girl and an older 
     girl of about 16, the girl she saw at the swimming pool, 
     KATIE. Epps holds on this picture, when A MUSIC BOX SOUNDS.  
     She looks up to the dressing table. On it a music box slowly 
     plays "Daisy."

     AT THE TABLE

     Epps crosses to it, looking on at the music box as it slowly 
     winds down, then finally stops. A beat. She picks it up, 
     looking at it, when she looks up to see Greer standing there.  
     A beat.

     The dirty white light falling into the room through the 
     windows falls on him as he looks off at something we cannot 
     see. His expression is empty, hollow.

                    EPPS
          Greer?

     He does not hear her as he stands there. She approaches, 
     stepping up.

                    EPPS
          You okay?

     Another beat, as he looks off, into the light, when he slowly 
     turns to see her.

     A long beat as she looks back. He holds there, the same empty 
     look about him, when he grabs her by the throat and squeezes 
     hard.

     She is stunned, breathless, but raises her hands to grip his 
     wrists, fighting him.

                    EPPS
          Greer!

     His grip tightens. He is much stronger and her efforts make 
     little difference.

                    EPPS
          Let go!

     She hangs on, starting to choke. She drops one hand, searching 
     with it.

                    GREER
          Oragishlaoomnudrasadrafantoshviska 
          getofedobrodijotosiantosg.

     He speaks nonsense, his face distorted in an ugly grimace, 
     eyes bulging as Epps fumbles over the table, a tray of glass 
     and silver crashing to the floor as he pushes her back, still 
     choking her.

     He backs her to the wall, pushing in, closing her windpipe 
     the rest of the way.

     Her hand searches behind her, knocking over a small vase, a 
     basket, some books. It comes to a brass desk lamp. It falls, 
     a little out of reach.

     She is going to black out any second, as Greer strangles 
     her.

     Her hand comes to the desk lamp, grabbing it.

     She raises the lamp, swinging with all her might, connecting 
     with Greer's head.

     He stumbles back, a gash laid into his face, as Epps sucks 
     in air, gagging and coughing, her neck purple with finger 
     marks.  She fumbles her radio up.

                    EPPS
               (into radio)
          Murphy! I'm on C deck, cabin 400!  
          Get down here now!!

     Blood is running down his face as Greer comes for her again.  
     She throws down the radio.

     A bed stands between them. She feints right, then left. He's 
     dazed and has blood in his eyes. She manages to slip by, but 
     he dives, taking her down.

     He drags her back along the floor, spinning her around. He 
     raises a fist to ram into her face when WHAM!

     Epps has shoved the butt of her flashlight into his crotch 
     and he comes up SCREAMING. He grabs her face, striking her 
     with his other hand.

     She swings the flashlight again and cracks him across the 
     head. He swings yet again and connects, knocking her across 
     the floor.

     She lies in a heap as Greer climbs to his feet, enraged and 
     bleeding.

     He unbuckles his belt as he approaches, pulling it from his 
     waist to do God knows what.

     Epps looks around to see him approaching. And we see that 
     she has unhinged her gill knife.

     As his foot steps near, she lets go and drives the knife 
     with all her might into his boot, plunging the blade through 
     his foot and into the floor. He SCREAMS.

     After a moment he stops, looks to her. He is a bloody, 
     wretched, enraged mess. He starts toward her as Murphy appears 
     in the doorway.

     Just as Greer is upon her, Murphy blind sides Greer from 
     behind at full speed, knocking him down.

     Greer and Murphy struggle as Epps climbs unsteadily to her 
     feet. She staggers to them and raises the flashlight over 
     Greer, bringing it down on his head.

     CUT TO BLACK

     INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - LATER - DAY

     Epps and Murphy carry Greer's unconscious body.

     INT. CHIMERA - AQUARIUM TANK - LATER - DAY

     Greer tumbles down a sand bank in an empty aquarium. He stops 
     at the bottom, now starting to come to.

     OUTSIDE

     Murphy slams the door shut as Epps looks on. She puts a steel 
     pipe across the hatch lever so that it cannot be opened.

     INT. CHIMERA - AQUARIUM TANK - LATER - DAY

     Greer sits in the tank, visible through a large piece of 
     armored aquarium glass, amidst the fake coral. He sits in 
     the sand hugging his legs to his chest, bobbing slightly as 
     he speaks in his nonsensical language.

                    MURPHY (V.O.)
          Must've been him all along.

     Murphy and Epps look on from the outside in the promenade.

                    MURPHY
          Smashed the radio. Scuttled the boat. 
          Killed Dodge. Would've killed you. 
          He's off his nut, no doubt there.

     They watch him in silence a moment as Greer mutters and bobs.

                    MURPHY
          What do you think?

                    EPPS
          Could be a stroke. Who knows?
               (a beat)
          The general log said the crew were 
          fighting among themselves. "Like 
          wild dogs."

                    MURPHY
          Over the gold.

                    EPPS
          Maybe it was more than that.

     Greer gets up, comes to the window, looking out at them. He 
     presses his face to the glass.

                    EPPS
          They went crazy.

                    MURPHY
          Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not 
          like him.

     A beat as Epps looks off. In the window Greer drags his 
     hideously distorted face over the glass, the blood from his 
     wounds smearing in broad red streaks.

     EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY

     A partial hull of a rotting life boat falls into frame. Epps 
     and Murphy stand over it.

                    MURPHY
          We lash a few of these together it 
          might get us far enough into the 
          shipping lanes to be rescued.

     A beat as they look on at the rotting hull.

                    MURPHY
          Hard to say which is worse, staying 
          here or taking our chances in open 
          water.

                    EPPS
          If the weather holds it might not be 
          so bad.

                    MURPHY
          It's not the weather I'm worried 
          about. The wrong current could drag 
          us as far as the Aleutians before we 
          come across another boat.

     EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY

     Epps and Murphy work to lash parts of the rotting boats into 
     a single usable raft.

     INT. CHIMERA - AQUARIUM TANK - DAY

     Greer lies asleep on the sand bottom of the tank, the white 
     light from the skylight falling on him from above.

     INT. CHIMERA - STORAGE AREA - DAY

     Epps has found a reel of wire and some metal braces, making 
     her way into the darkness, when her radio CRACKLES TO LIFE.  
     The channel remains silent a moment, then closes. She stops, 
     raises the radio.

                    EPPS
               (holding down talk 
               button)
          Murphy?

     She waits, holding there as only silence comes back.

                    EPPS
          Murphy, this is Epps. Do you copy?

     Again, only silence comes back until, after a moment, the 
     channel opens again. No one speaks, though there is a palpable 
     presence on the other end.

                    EPPS
               (raising the radio)
          Who is this?

     The channel opens again, only silence returning. The sound 
     of the MUSIC BOX CAN BE HEARD, "DAISY" COMING BACK OVER THE 
     RADIO.

     INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

     Epps walks along in the darkness AS THE MUSIC BOX CONTINUES 
     TO PLAY OVER THE RADIO. She comes to the end of the corridor, 
     stopping there.

     At the other end the light falls from the door at room 400.

     The MUSIC FROM THE RADIO STOPS, leaving in its absence the 
     MUSIC AS IT CAN BE HEARD COMING FROM THE ROOM AT THE END OF 
     THE CORRIDOR.

     INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

     Epps approaches the other end, from where the MUSIC EMANATES, 
     coming to a stop at room 400. A beat as she holds there.

     INT. CHIMERA - ROOM 400 - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Epps steps in as THE MUSIC BOX PLAYS IN THE OTHER ROOM.

     The sitting room is dark as she holds there. After a moment, 
     she continues on, coming to the bedroom.

     Epps steps in. Across the room the MUSIC BOX IS PLAYING.

     She crosses, coming to it as it continues, when her radio 
     CRACKLES TO LIFE. The channel remains silent a moment, then:

                    VOICE
          "Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster 
          to the crow. Where are you now? I 
          know but won't say so."

     She holds there a beat, then crosses to the table to find 
     the book of nursery rhymes. She opens it to the nursery rhyme 
     "The Rooster and the Crow," seeing the same words on the 
     page, when the radio CRACKLES AGAIN.

                    VOICE
          Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
          toy. Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
          toy.

     On the table is the penny whistle she saw earlier. She takes 
     it, holding on it a moment. She raises it and THE CAMERA 
     SLOWLY PUSHES IN as she puts it to her lips and lightly blows 
     a C-SHARP WHICH BECOMES A C-SHARP FROM A PENNY WHISTLE across 
     the room.

                    MOTHER
          "Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster 
          to the crow. Where are you now? I 
          know but won't say so."

     On the other side of the room, the younger girl from the 
     photo plays the penny whistle. She is sitting on the floor 
     with the MOTHER who reads from the book we saw earlier.

                    MOTHER
          "Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster 
          to the crow. Where are you now? I 
          know but won't say so." Cassandra, 
          if you insist on playing that while 
          I read I'll just stop right now.

                    THE GIRL
          Sorry.

     The room is warm with light, restored to its original 
     condition some fifty years ago as Epps stands there, unseen, 
     no longer holding the whistle.

     A man, the FATHER from the photos, steps from the bathroom 
     wearing a new coat.

                    FATHER
          What do you think?

                    MOTHER
          He certainly did shorten it, didn't 
          he?

                    FATHER
          I thought this was all the rage.

                    KATIE
          Maybe last year.

     Katie joins them from the outer room.

                    FATHER
          What about this year?

                    KATIE
          It's not your color anyway.

                    GIRL
          I like it, daddy.

                    FATHER
          Well thank you!

                    GIRL
          Daddy, how much longer before we 
          start moving again?

                    FATHER
          They're working on the engines, honey. 
          As soon as they fix them we'll be on 
          our way.

     INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

     Epps steps from room 400 into the passageway. It is lit with 
     sconces running its length and the elegant furnishings and 
     objets d'art stretching to the far end are all in their 
     original condition. DISTANT MUSIC FROM THE BALLROOM CAN BE 
     HEARD as Epps stands there. She moves along.

     INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

     Epps walks in the passageway. Doors are open and she looks 
     in to see people doing various things, some packing and 
     putting their things in order.

     INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

     Epps walks down the passage, rounding the corner to see three 
     STEWARDS fighting with a fourth MAN in a tuxedo. They lift 
     him up and carry him off down the stairs as he shouts and 
     protests. She moves on, through a pair of double doors, into

     INT. CHIMERA - STORAGE COMPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Epps moves through the now lighted storage area off the 
     galley. A group of CREWMEN stand around at the other end 
     and, as Epps nears, she sees that four figures can be seen 
     among them. They are four men, OFFICERS, swaying gently from 
     the ship's movement as they hang from ropes around their 
     neck, dead. Epps keeps moving, through doors at the other 
     end.

     INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

     A commotion can be heard at the other end of the passageway 
     as Epps keeps moving. A WOMAN SCREAMS, and is cut off when a 
     door slams shut.

     The DISTANT MUSIC HAS BEEN REPLACED WITH INDISCERNIBLE 
     SHOUTING, as of someone commandeering the microphone somewhere

     As she walks, she passes an open door where several CREWMEN 
     fight over a steamer trunk, which breaks open, scattering 
     the contents.

     INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

     Epps walks along, coming to another door where a dead man 
     and woman are laying in the middle of the room as a STEWARD 
     takes money from a wallet. The steward looks up, reaches 
     over and slams the door shut. She continues on.

     Another door stands open as she comes to it, back at room 
     400. She stops. A REPETITIVE SOUND CAN BE HEARD, coming from 
     inside.

     INT. CHIMERA - ROOM 400 - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Epps steps in as the SOUND CONTINUES. She crosses the sitting 
     room, coming to the doorway of the bedroom to find several 
     MUTINEERS, some in stewards attire, others wearing ships 
     officers caps, obviously taken from their rightful owners.

     The repetitive sound comes from here, bed springs. And, from 
     between the men, a woman's bare legs hang over the end of 
     the bed as a pair of man's legs in boots lie between them, 
     the bed rocking, the others looking on.

     Epps turns to see the father. He is on his knees, hands tied 
     behind his back as he is forced to watch from the foot of 
     the bed.

     EPPS LOOKS DOWN TO SEE

     EPPS' POV

     a geometric pattern of a lotus on the Persian carpet at her 
     feet. When she looks up again she sees what the father sees.

     The mutineer finishes, climbing off the woman. Another of 
     the men pulls her up to reveal that she is no woman at all, 
     but Katie.

     The mother and sister lie in a bloody heap near-by as one of 
     the other mutineers steps up to Epps.

                    MUTINEER
          You like that, daddy? I'll show you 
          something else now.

     The mutineer steps back to the bed. He sits Katie down so 
     that she faces us on the end of the bed. He raises an axe 
     over her, bringing it down as the world becomes a whirling 
     blur --

                    EPPS (V.O.)
          NO!!!!

     BACK TO SCENE

     The CAMERA STOPS ON KATIE standing on the other side of the 
     room, now empty of people, returned to its shabby, abandoned 
     state.

                    KATIE
          It isn't real.

     Epps looks back at her from the other side of the room where 
     she stands.

                    KATIE
          Many bad things have happened here.  
          But you mustn't allow the evil inside. 
          I tell you this because you can see 
          me. The others can't. But you must 
          leave. You must leave.

     A LOUD GUNSHOT SOUNDS SOMEWHERE IN THE SHIP. When Epps turns 
     back Katie is gone.

     INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

     Epps moves quickly along, raising her radio.

                    MURPHY
          Epps to Murphy.

     Only WHITE NOISE COMES BACK.

                    EPPS
          Epps to Murphy.

     Only WHITE NOISE COMES BACK as she rounds the corner out 
     onto the promenade. At the other end, the aquarium can be 
     seen.

     As she approaches she sees that the tank is empty. Greer is 
     nowhere to be seen and the skylight at the top is broken 
     out.

     A GREAT BOOMING SHUDDER rocks the ship. A LOUD SCREECHING OF 
     METAL follows it.

     EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     The ship's hull being scraped at the waterline by a jagged 
     mid-ocean island no bigger than fifty or sixty feet across.

     The ship has entered a small archipelago of such islands, a 
     mine field for a drifting ship.

     INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

     Epps moves quickly along, coming to the stairway, moving up, 
     almost running into Murphy on his way down, carrying a canvas 
     duffle.

                    EPPS
          What happened?

                    MURPHY
          We hit land.

                    EPPS
          What?

                    MURPHY
          We're in an island chain. It's only 
          a matter of time before we hit another 
          one.

                    EPPS
          Greer's gone. He broke out of the 
          tank.

     INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

     Epps and Murphy move quickly along, when another HUGE BOOMING 
     shudders the ship and the SHRIEKING OF METAL follows.

     EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     The ship bounces off another of the small, jagged islands as 
     it drifts past, buckling the steel plate of the hull 
     precariously.

     INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Murphy and Epps run toward the other end of the ship. As 
     they do, something can be seen lying in the middle of the 
     passage some distance down.

     AT THE OTHER END

     Epps and Murphy slow to see that it is a body, lying face 
     down in the passage.

     They step up. Epps kneels as Murphy looks on. She rolls the 
     body over. It is Greer, dead.

                    EPPS
          He's been shot.

     Murphy kneels too, looking on at Greer's lifeless eyes.

                    MURPHY
          Let's get the hell out of here.

     INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY/PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

     Murphy and Epps come up the stairway, crossing to the doors.

     EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     As Epps and Murphy come out, moving toward the make-do raft.

                    MURPHY
          It should be enough to get us to one 
          of those islands. Gimme a hand, 
          wouldya?

     She joins him and they lift it off its stand, taking it to 
     the rail.

                    MURPHY
          Prop it here. We need to pull these 
          braces off. There's a hammer on the 
          stand. There.

     Epps crosses back to the stands.

     AT THE STANDS

     Epps kneels. No hammer. She pulls back Murphy's canvas duffle, 
     folding back the flap to reveal a shotgun, the shotgun Dodge 
     had when he died.

     A beat as she holds there, when Murphy's hand grabs it.

                    MURPHY
          I'll take that.

     A beat as she looks to Murphy.

                    EPPS
          It was you.

     He only looks back at her as she stands there.

                    EPPS
          You killed them.

                    MURPHY
          It was only a matter of time before 
          somebody killed somebody.
               (a beat)
          You saw it coming as well as I did.  
          Dodge had his plans, starting with 
          scuttling the boat. And Greer too, 
          except he went nuts. Couldn't take 
          it, I guess. Could've happened in 
          the middle of downtown Anchorage.  
          But did it make him any less 
          dangerous? I don't think so.

                    EPPS
          So you killed them?

                    MURPHY
          The way I figure it, it was them or 
          me. I thought putting Dodge up on 
          that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a 
          little time. Made it look like whoever 
          killed those Greeks was still around. 
          But it's just us on this ship. Us 
          and your... spirit friends.

                    EPPS
          And now you're gonna kill me, is 
          that it?

                    MURPHY
          I didn't want it to turn out this 
          way.

                    EPPS
          Murphy, don't you see what's 
          happening?

                    MURPHY
          I think I see it pretty well.

                    EPPS
          It's the ship. The ship's making you 
          think this way.

                    MURPHY
          I know a little bit about human nature 
          and what I've seen only confirms 
          that.

                    EPPS
          It's a trap. There was no way we 
          were gonna get away with that gold.  
          Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. 
          This ship sucks people in and it 
          never lets them out.

                    MURPHY
          I think maybe you been on this boat 
          a little too long, with all that 
          supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's 
          nothing supernatural about greed.  
          And that's what it comes down to, 
          pure and simple.

                    EPPS
          I don't give a damn about the gold.

                    MURPHY
          I wish I could believe that. Either 
          way, you know what I've done. I've 
          got no choice.

     He raises the shotgun.

                    MURPHY
          I'm sorry.

     He prepares to fire, when a CONCUSSION ROCKS THE SHIP. Epps 
     ducks and Murphy fires, a spatter of buckshot shredding the 
     vent behind her. A SCREECHING OF METAL DEEP IN THE SHIP SOUNDS 
     as she gets up, diving for cover as Murphy shuttles the gun 
     again.

     WITH EPPS

     Epps scrambles behind a deck vent.

     EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     The ship has bounced off yet another small island, the jagged 
     rocks loudly scrapping the hull with a deafening shriek.

     EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Murphy crosses toward the deck vent.

                    MURPHY
          There's no reason to make this any 
          more difficult than it has to be.

     WITH EPPS

     As Epps holds there she sees the vent opening. She pulls 
     herself up and climbs inside.

     INT. CHIMERA - AIR SHAFT - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Epps climbs down the air shaft where a giant fan spans its 
     width. She squeezes through the fan blades and drops down 
     where several vent ducts lead in different directions below 
     it.

     EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Murphy comes to the vent duct where Epps went down.

     INT. CHIMERA - AIR DUCT - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Epps crawls through. She comes to a vent that leads out to a 
     passageway.

     INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Murphy runs quickly down the stairway, shotgun at the ready.

     INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     The vent is shoved out and falls to the metal catwalk.

     INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     The CLANG FROM THE VENT SOUNDS HERE and Murphy stops.

     INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Epps extends her feet and climbs down into the passage.

     INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Murphy rounds the corner, moving on the same deck.

     INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Epps moves along on a metal catwalk in the darkness when 
     something can be heard ahead of her. She stops.

     FOOTSTEPS SOUND at the end of the passage. Epps pulls back 
     into the shadows, holding there.

     The footsteps sound as if they are coming down stairs at the 
     other end, when the FOOTSTEPS STOP.

     Epps holds there, listening intently in the silence when, at 
     the other end, THE SOUND OF CREAKING METAL, as from a hatch 
     slowly opening, can be heard. It stops. All is silent, WHEN 
     THE HATCH CREAKS AGAIN at the other end. She begins moving 
     toward it.

     As she approaches, she can see that the hatch is half open, 
     swaying slightly with the movement of the ship.

     A CREAKING SOUNDS behind her. She turns, just as Murphy steps 
     into view. She ducks as he fires and a spray of buckshot 
     ricochets off the metal around her.

     She scrambles on her belly as Murphy fires again. She swings 
     down from the catwalk, letting herself fall to the next deck.

     AT THE BOTTOM

     Epps gets up, runs.

     WITH MURPHY

     Murphy climbs down a ladder to the lower decks.

     INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Epps moves quickly along.

     INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Murphy follows, when A RUMBLING SOUND CAN BE HEARD.

     INT. CHIMERA  - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Epps stops where she is in the cavernous engine room, looking 
     on at the massive hull rising above her as the RUMBLING GROWS 
     IN INTENSITY. Though it seems to resonate throughout the 
     ship, it seems to originate from here, from directly below, 
     as though the hull were being dragged over a rocky bottom.

     She steps back as the sound grows still louder, until it 
     becomes absolutely deafening.

     The ship begins to shudder. The steel bulkheads visibly move 
     and the steel plates in the hull can be seen to bend back 
     and forth.

     INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Murphy slows and finally stops.

     INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     A few rivets pop in the hull. Then a few more, as the RUMBLING 
     GROWS STILL LOUDER.

     Epps puts her hands to her ears and begins to back away, 
     when the RUMBLING REACHES A PINNACLE. The rivets are springing 
     out of the hull like machine gun fire when the steel plate 
     of the hull gives way, A MASSIVE CRAG OF ROCK SMASHING THROUGH 
     WITH A TREMENDOUS BOOM AND A TORRENT OF SEAWATER.

     Epps ducks for cover as the crag tears a diagonal line through 
     the Chimera's hull like a jagged claw through paper in a 
     HORRENDOUS TUMULT OF NOISE AND STEAM AND SPARKS.

     EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     The Chimera is impaled broadside by a particularly devious 
     rock promontory of a small island.

     INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     The giant claw begins to pull back, as the ship drifts off, 
     water pouring in behind it.

     EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     The ship is drifting free of the island with the current, a 
     huge gash rising on its port side.

     INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     A massive torrent sweeps over Epps as seawater pours in 
     through the breach.

     INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Murphy stops where he is to see water rushing in at the end 
     of the passage. He begins backing away.

     INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Epps is forced under as the water in the hull is already 
     half way up the side, the ship listing WITH A GREAT GROANING 
     EXERTION.

     INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Murphy moves down the passageway, coming to the cargo 
     compartment.

     INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Epps comes up for air. A clatter of all manner of debris, 
     tools and general detritus hammers against the far bulkhead 
     as the ship eases over. A boiler breaks loose of its stays.

     Epps looks up to see it coming right for her. She ducks under 
     the water as the boiler slams into the bulkhead where she 
     was.

     WITH EPPS

     Epps is forced down by the boiler, trapped between it and 
     the bulkhead.

     INT. CHIMERA - CARGO HOLD - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     The gold slides off the palette, crashing into the far wall.  
     Murphy hurries to it, collecting ingots and putting them in 
     his pockets.

     INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Epps struggles under the water to free herself, but she is 
     trapped, the heavy boiler and its broken stays caging her.

     ABOVE THE WATER

     The level of the water has now almost completely reached the 
     deck above, filling the ship almost entirely below decks.

     INT. CHIMERA - CARGO HOLD - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     The water is threateningly high as Murphy pockets one last 
     ingot and makes his way for the exit.

     INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Epps is trying to pull back the boiler stays, without luck.  
     She swims down lower, finding a pipe fitting she pries at 
     the stays, without luck, when a form drifts into view in the 
     murky water.

     Several more forms appear. They are human, suspended in the 
     water. As Epps looks, the several forms have become many.  
     They are the bodies of the dead she saw in the pool before.

     As they look on at her from where they are, one form emerges.  
     It is Katie.

     She reaches toward Epps, as if beckoning her to take her 
     hand from the other side. Epps raises her hand, taking it.

     The girl leads Epps down into the murky darkness where she 
     finds a way out. She takes her back further, coming to the 
     breech, leading her out and into a cool green void of water.

     Katie stops at the breach. Epps turns to her. She only looks 
     back at Epps. Epps turns away, swimming upward toward the 
     light of the surface.

     EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

     Epps breaks through, gasping for air. She looks to see the 
     Chimera, listing heavily to one side, its bow decks fully 
     awash.

     INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Murphy staggers through the flooded passage.

     EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     The Chimera is getting lower in the water, the bow submerged 
     and the stern beginning to rise.

     Epps sees another small island some distance off. She begins 
     swimming toward it.

     INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Water runs down the stairway as Murphy struggles toward the 
     top.

     EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Epps swims as the ship sinks in the distance.

     INT. CHIMERA - PROMENADE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     A river of water rushes through as Murphy crosses with 
     difficulty.

     EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Epps reaches the jagged rock of the island. She pulls herself 
     up.

     EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Water rushes in as Murphy wades out onto the Chimera's top 
     deck. He is heavily weighted down and periodically goes under 
     as he half wades half swims, the length of the ship's aft 
     portion rising above him as the bow sinks.

     EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS -  DAY

     Epps collapses on the rocks.

     EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     As the ship moves lower, Murphy pushes off. He bobs under 
     momentarily, then comes back up with difficulty. The forward 
     smoke stack has dipped under and is now taking on water, the 
     current from the rushing water pulling him toward it.

     EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS -  DAY

     Epps looks on as the giant ship angles higher and higher.

     EXT. CHIMERA - WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     As the ship dips lower, the rushing water forms an eddy that 
     pulls at Murphy. Murphy struggles, too heavy to resist as he 
     is pulled closer and closer to the sucking maw that is the 
     smokestack's opening.

     The ship sinks further and Murphy is pulled to the edge of 
     the stack. He frantically grabs for something to hold on to, 
     without success, until he is finally pulled into the smoke 
     stack and sucked into the bowels of the ship by the rushing 
     water.

     EXT. ISLAND - LATER - DAY

     Epps sits perched under a rock out of the wind, looking on 
     at the Chimera, her stern rising high above water as she 
     goes down, when the RUMBLE OF ENGINES CAN BE HEARD.

     She turns to see a Coastguard plane sweeping low over the 
     Chimera, then banking back and flying right over as she shouts 
     and waves her arms.

     EXT. ISLAND - LATER - DAY

     The Coastguard plane flies by one more time, this time 
     dropping a survival pack.

     The Chimera's stern rises up out of the water, almost vertical 
     now, slipping further and further under.

     Epps looks on one last time, as the ship goes down.

     EXT. OCEAN - WITH CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     The afterdeck of the Chimera sinks slowly, slowly down, the 
     CAMERA PUSHING IN TO "CHIMERA" as the name comes to the water, 
     then slips slowly beneath the surface. And THE CAMERA FOLLOWS, 
     MOVING INTO THE WATER to reveal that, beneath the surface, 
     there is no ship at all, only the vast empty depths of the 
     ocean.

     FADE TO BLACK

                THE END
