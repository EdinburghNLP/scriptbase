6/26/98

     FADE IN:
     On complete darkness.
     A SMALL DOOR swings open.
     A circle of light reveals that we I re looking down the 
     length of a tube. At the far end of the tube, we see a 
     gloved hand dangling a rat. The hand shoves the 
     frightened rat into the tube and closes the door behind 
     it. The rat s stark white fur bristles and it begins to 
     pad down the tube s length.
     After several feet, the tube opens up into a dimly lit 
     cubicle. The rat hesitates and stops.
     The SOUNDS of gentle BREATHING whispers in the rat s 
     ears.
     The rat turns round to head back down the tube, but a 
     door swings shut, trapping it in the cubicle.
     The rat cowers as the BREATHING turns to SNORTING.
     The rat s head jerks around, looking for signs of danger, 
     but the cubicle is empty. The rat sees a water dish on 
     the far side of the cubicle - a place to hide - and 
     dashes toward it.
     But an invisible force descends.
     The rat squeals in agony as something smashes down on its 
     body, crushing it.
     A LOUD BELLOW rings out, and the rat flies into the air, 
     halting a few feet off the ground. Its body writhes, 
     struggling against the unholy force.
     Then a sick crunch of tiny bones snapping. All life 
     quickly drains from the levitating body. Dead eyes...
     The creature s corpse floats in mid-air. Then the white 
     fur of the rat explodes in a shower of blood.
     HUGE BLOOD SMEARED INCISORS appear, as do the red-slicked 
     ape- like lips. The gaping bloody mouth bites again into 
     the rat.
                                             
     CUT TO:
     INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
     In the background we hear Jay Leno s monologue from the 
     Tonight Show. A small lamp and the glow from a computer 
     screen illuminates SEBASTIAN CAINE, late twenties with 
     the shabby good looks of a perpetual grad-student. Wiry 
     framed and wearing only boxer shorts, Sebastian sips 
     coffee from an  Einstein  coffee mug. He peers at a 
     complex computer rendered molecule displayed on his 
     screen. He pecks a few keys and the molecule shifts 
     slightly, then falls apart.
     Sebastian pulls a twinkie from a hostess box, unwraps the 
     cellophane and sucks it down. He attacks the keyboard 
     with renewed vigor.
     Another molecule appears on the screen. Sebastian s 
     fingers fly across the keyboard. The molecule blinks on 
     and off, it trembles and twists apart.
                    SEBASTIAN
               Damnit.
     Sebastian pears out his window. Across the courtyard, a 
     light comes on in a neighboring window. He sees a 
     BRUNETTE, mid-twenties, absolutely stunning, enter her 
     living room. The Brunette thumbs through the mail, tosses 
     it and then begins to undress. Sebastian loans over to 
     the window, getting interested. But when the brunette 
     reaches her bra and panties, she crosses to the window 
     and lowers her shades.
                    SEBASTIAN (cont d)
               Damnit.
     Sebastian leans back in his chair and closes his eyes. 
     He s obviously tired. He opens his eyes and stares up at 
     the ceiling. Painted across the white matte finish in big 
     red letters is a brief reminder -  You Should Be 
     Working.  Sebastian sighs, leans forward and begins 
     pecking away again.
                                                   
LATER:
     The television is now only static. We pan by his alarm 
     clock. 4 am. We find Sebastian pacing in front of his 
     computer.
     He gets an idea... slides back in his chair. Types away 
     again. The molecule reforms on the computer screen.
     He types a few more keys, waits, watches the molecule. 
     Nothing happens.
     He hits a few more keys and watches intently for a 
     reaction.
                    SEBASTIAN
                     (beat)
               I am a goddamn genius.
     He hits a few more keys and a telephone keypad appears on 
     the screen. He dials.
                                             
     CUT TO:
     INT. ANOTHER BEDROOM - NIGHT
     Digital phone rings.
     In the bed, LINDA FOSTER, late twenties, stirs from a 
     deep sleep. As she straggles out of bed and over to her 
     desk, we notice a young man sleeping next to her.
     The ringing continues. She moves her computer mouse 
     around and her screen comes to life. She click on a 
     telephone icon and the ringing stops. A beat later, 
     Sebastian appears in a window on her screen.
                    LINDA
               Sebastian, do you know what time it 
               is?
                    SEBASTIAN (SCREEN)
               You know Da Vinci never slept. Said it 
               was waste of time.
                    LINDA
               What is it this time?
     INTERCUT: SEBASTIAN S BEDROOM
     Sebastian peers at the image of Linda in the computer 
     window. He notices something behind her in the bed, the 
     young man sleeping face down.
                    SEBASTIAN
               Who s that?
     Linda pulls the camera off the top of the of the computer 
     screen and positions it so Sebastian can t see the bed.
                    LINDA
               Not your business. Not anymore.
                    SEBASTIAN
               Touche.
                    LINDA
               So you calling about anything in 
               particular, or were you just hoping to 
               catch me sleeping in the nude?
                    SEBASTIAN
               I cracked the reversion.
     Upon hearing this, Linda receives a jolt of adrenaline.
                    LINDA
               You cracked it?
                    SEBASTIAN
               Look at this. 
     Sebastian hits a couple of keys. A moment later the 
     molecular structure appears on Linda s computer.
                    SEBASTIAN
               Watch this.
                    LINDA
               You sure?
                    SEBASTIAN
               91% sure.
                    LINDA
                     (astonished)
               Eleven months with no progress and you 
               suddenly come up with it out of the 
               blue? How?
                    SEBASTIAN
               The usual. Coffee and twinkies.
                    LINDA
               I hate you.
                    SEBASTIAN
               I know. You think you could hunt down 
               Matt and get to the lab early. I want 
               Isabelle prepped for a live test.
                    LINDA
               Yeah, I think I can find him. What are 
               you going to do?
                    SEBASTIAN
               Well y know. It s daylight in 
               Switzerland. I gotta call the Nobel
               Committee and tell them to get our
               prizes ready. See you in a few.
     ON LINDA S COMPUTER SCREEN as Sebastian clicks off. Linda 
     crosses to her bed, and shakes the guy awake.
                    LINDA
               Hey... come on.
     DR. MATTHEW KENSINGTON, late 20s too, stirs from under 
     sheets.
                    MATT
                     (groggy)
               What?
                    LINDA
               Sebastian just called. We gotta get to 
               the lab.
     Matt bolts up.
                    MATT
               Shit! You didn t tell him I was here, 
               did you?
                    LINDA
               Give me some credit, will ya.
                    MATT
               So what s the rush?
                    LINDA
               He cracked reversion.
     Matt pulls his jeans on.
                    MATT
               Wanna ride down?
                    LINDA
               We better take our own cars.
                    MATT
               You re gonna have to tell him about us 
               eventually.
                    LINDA
               I know. It s just You re his best 
               friend. He ll feel betrayed.
     EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. SKYLINE - DAY
     From a distance, the Nation s Monuments stand awash in 
     the harsh light of morning.
     CAMERA finds a BLACK PORSCHE as it pulls to the security 
     fence of a warehouse. The imposing structure is 
     surrounded by a chainlink fence and barbed wire.
     The Porsche is waved through security and heads straight 
     into the warehouse.
     INT. WAREHOUSE -DAY
     The Porsche pulls to a halt in a reserved parking space 
     and Sebastian exits, wearing a Hawaiian shirt, shorts, 
     and Birkenstocks. He notes the other cars parked in the 
     lot, then crosses to bunker in the center of the 
     warehouse, guarded by a MARINE, shouldering an M-16.
                    MARINE GUARD
               Morning, sir.
                    SEBASTIAN
               Morning, Ed.
                    MARINE GUARD
               Your team s in early. Something 
               special going on?
                    SEBASTIAN
               Sorry, Ed. You know the rules. 
     Sebastian presses his thumb against a glass screen. A 
     laser reads his print. 
     Scan readout: CAINE, SEBASTIAN 
     Clearance:    ALPHA ALPHA THREE 
     Division:     CLASSIFIED 
     The doors whisk open and Sebastian steps inside.
                    MARINE GUARD
               Have a good day, sir.
     INT. ELEVATOR - DAY
     Inside the elevator is a numberless keypad. Sebastian 
     taps in his floor code.
                    ELEVATOR (V.0.)
               Authorization please.
                    SEBASTIAN
               Caine zero zero two seven.
                    ELEVATOR (V.0.)
               Authorization verified. Good morning, 
               Dr. Caine. 
     The elevator descends with a groaning hum. It passes 
     below us and keeps descending into the belly of the 
     earth, the shaft goes down forever.
     INT. HABITAT S CORRIDOR
     We slowly push down a hallway panelled by Plexiglas 
     chambers. Each chamber looks as if it s tailored for a 
     specific animal, although no animals are visible.
     As we pass one habitat, something slams into the 
     Plexiglas and begins barking. Another HOWL joins in. Then 
     SCREECHING. Suddenly the hallway fills with a dozen 
     animal cries. THUMP.
     THUMP.
     The Plexiglas on several chambers vibrates as if angry 
     animals were slamming against it. But still, no animals 
     are seen.
     Above each chamber, VIDEO SCREENS display THERMAL IMAGES 
     revealing heat signatures of the various animals, but 
     they remain invisible to the naked eye. MATT taps on a 
     sheet of Plexiglas which seals off another seemingly 
     empty cage.
                    MATT
               Isabelle ...
     The woodchips on the floor shift and suddenly the 
     Plexiglas steams up right in front of Matt s face. The 
     Plexiglas begins to shake violently.
                    MATT (cont d)
               Calm down baby. Calm down. It s 
               okay...
     Matt takes a pair of thermal goggles from his belt and 
     pulls them down over his eyes. 
     THERMAL POV - A rather large heat signature, ape-like in 
     shape, rattles about the cage. Matt slowly unlatches the 
     Plexiglas door and reaches inside.
                    MATT (cont d)
               It s okay, baby. It s okay. I m not 
               going to hurt you. Come here.
     THERMAL POV - he reaches out to the creature. He grabs 
     hold of it, firmly. Stroking it. The creature COOS. Matt 
     reaches for a hypo and brings it up to the creature.
                    MATT (cont d)
               Just hold still. 
     Something clamps down on his hand, breaking his skin. 
     Blood erupts in a bite pattern.
                    MATT (cont d)
                Ow, shit.
     Matt drops the hypo and falls back. The cage door flies 
     open and something runs out. Matt pulls himself up to see 
     the heat signature running down the hallway. He turns 
     around to see another heat signature coming at him. Matt 
     pulls off his goggles to see Linda coming up the 
     Corridor.
                    LINDA
               You okay?
                    MATT
               She bit me.
                    LINDA
               Yeah. She s become a lot more 
               aggressive in the last few days.
     Linda takes the goggles from Matt.
                    LINDA (cont d)
               Go take care of that bite. I ll get 
               her.
                    MATT
               And give you a chance to pull ahead? 
               Never.
     Linda opens a lock-box at the end of the hallway and 
     pulls out a two tranquilizer guns. She hands one to Matt.
     AROUND THE CORNER
     A slight distortion shimmers as something runs past us. 
     We hear HOOTS and FOOTSTEPS.
     Looking down the shadowy corridor, we hear grunting and a 
     haunting heavy breathing. The control door is closed 
     though and something large and angry is throwing itself 
     against it. We can t see anything.
     A few moments later, Linda and Matt round the corner, 
     wearing goggles and leveling their pistols.
                    MATT
                     (ala Porky)
               Shh. Be vewy, vewy quiet. I m hunting 
               simians.   heheheheh.
                    LINDA
               Knock it off.
                     (soothing voice)
               Isabelle!
     THERMAL POV - Dark hallway. Movement. A red shimmering 
     heat signature. It comes running at Linda. HOWLING. Linda 
     fires. A T-DART flies. Thwack... It stops in mid-air. 
     Then falls. But it doesn t hit the floor. Instead, it 
     stops inches above the ground. 
     THERMAL POV - the heat signature lies in a heap at 
     Linda s feet.
                    MATT
               Good shootin , Tex.
                    LINDA
               What s that make it?
                    MATT
               I m still ahead. 6 to 5.
     Like a smug gunfighter, Linda blows imaginary smoke from 
     the top of her tranquilizer gun.
                    LINDA
               But I m catching up.
     INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
     The elevator doors open and Sebastian steps out. He s met 
     by SARAH KENNEDY, early thirties, a fiery red-head.
                    SARAH
               Can I have a word?
                    SEBASTIAN
               Most normal people say good morning.
                    SARAH
               Don t you think you should test the 
               protocol on the liver samples before 
               you inject Isabelle?
                    SEBASTIAN
               How many tissue samples have we 
               successfully regressed? Hundreds, 
               right? How many have gone on to work 
               on the full system? None.
                    SARAH
               That s beside the point.
                    SEBASTIAN
               No, that is the point. I m not going 
               to waste six months of my life on an 
               outmoded testing procedure. This thing 
               works. I know it. I feel it.
     Linda comes down the corridor, listening in on the tail 
     end of the conversation.
                    SARAH
               Fine. You can mop up afterward.
                    SEBASTIAN
               You think I m going to kill Isabelle?
                    SARAH
               Kill? More like liquefy.
                    SEBASTIAN
               Sarah, thank you for your opinion, but 
               I m the project leader. Understand? 
     She says ...
                    SARAH
               Yes, Sir.
     ... but somehow it feels like  Fuck you.  She storms off. 
     Sebastian turns to Linda.
                    SEBASTIAN
               How did you ever convince me to hire 
               her?
                    LINDA
               You said you wanted the beat vet in 
               the country.
                    SEBASTIAN
               Yeah, well she cares more about the 
               animals than the research.
                    LINDA
               Maybe that s why she s so good.
                                             
     CUT TO:
     CLOSE ON: MATT as he shuts off the spinning cyclotron. As 
     it s spinning slows to a halt, he pops the top and 
     reaches in, removing...
     A GLOWING VIAL OF ORANGE LIQUID.
     Sebastian peers at the vial.
                    SEBASTIAN
               Who da Man? You da Man.
                    MATT
               As we pull out we see we are.
     INT. LABORATORY - DAY
     Almost feels like a dungeon. Think high-tech 
     Frankenstein. Walls lined with video displays, technical 
     readouts, bizarre medical equipment.
     On a table in the middle of the room, a sheet drapes over 
     a humanoid form, strapped down at it s invisible limbs. 
     The straps move slightly... ghostly. Wires lead from the 
     body to lots of machinery.
                    MATT
               Protocol is hot.
                    SEBASTIAN
               Vitals?
     Sarah, checks over the various readouts ... heartbeat, 
     blood pressure, the rest.
                    SARAH
               Normal.
     CARTER ABBEY, the late thirties lab assistant, wheels in 
     a cart of equipment. Linda taken a seat by the table and 
     pushes aside the sheet.
                    BOOMING VOICE
               THIS IS GOD. YOU ARE DISTURBING THE
               NATURAL ORDER OF THINGS AND WILL BE
               SEVERELY PUNISHED FOR ALL ETERNITY.
               GOD HAS SPOKEN.
                    SEBASTIAN
               How many times do I have to tell you, 
               Frank you aren t God.
                     (beat)
               I am.
                    FRANK (LOUDSPEAKER)
               Sorry, Boss. Forgot.
     Sebastian glance up at a glass booth overlooking the 
     Laboratory floor. TWO PEOPLE in the booth.
                    SEBASTIAN
               You guys ready to roll?
     INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH
     FRANK CHASE, early thirties, and tech expert JANICE 
     WALTON, early twenties, man a small booth above the lab. 
     They re dressed more like band roadies than scientists.
     The room is crammed with electronic and recording 
     equipment. A handful of monitors display different images 
     of the lab. Thermal and regular video. Another screen 
     monitors vital signs.
                    FRANK
               We are live and in color. On your 
               mark.
     Frank and Janice looks down on their colleagues. 
     Sebastian nods their way.
                    SEBASTIAN
               Okay. Roll  em.
                    JANICE
               Okay. We are rolling record on videos 
               one through twelve.
     Frank hits a series of buttons and speaks into a 
     microphone. Recording.
     INT. LABORATORY - DAY
     Frank s voice echoes through the chamber.
                    FRANK (V.O.)
               Subject Isabelle Two. Currently in 
               phase shift... one hundred twenty six 
               days, eighteen hours.
                    LINDA
               Testing De-Phase protocol. Injecting 
               serial protein Caine One Two Five. 
     Linda removes a glowing vial of orange liquid from a 
     centrifuge nearby.
                    MATT
               Maybe if you stopped naming them after 
               yourself, you d have better luck.
                    SEBASTIAN
               Why thank you, Dr. Kensington, for 
               that keen scientific observation. I ll 
               be sure to include it in my memoirs.
                    MATT
               A whole mention? And I thought I was 
               just gonna be a footnote.
     Matt unwraps a hypodermic needle and jabs the needle into 
     the vial, drawing up the colored liquid.
     INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH
                    MATT
               Okay.
     Frank and Janice monitor Isabelle s vitals.
     INT. LABORATORY - DAY
     Tension in the air.
                    SEBASTIAN
                     (to Linda)
               Ready.
     She wraps a bungee cord around nothing and pulls it 
     tight. She then takes some dye and sprays it. A surface 
     appears, floating beneath the restraints. It sheens in 
     the light as Linda searches for a vein. She slaps the 
     surface several times. A small bulge appears, like a 
     vein.
                    LINDA
               Propped.
                    MATT
               Let s make some history.
     Matt lowers the hypo to the vein. But Sebastian takes the 
     hypo from Matt s hand.
                    SEBASTIAN
               Nice try, Sparky.
     Matt relinquishes the needle.
                    LINDA
               Come on, Isabelle. You can do this. 
     Sebastian lowers the hypo. The skin bonds and gives. The 
     needle remains in sight after it slips through the 
     visible surface. Matt presses down on the hypo plunger, 
     releasing a dye into his bloodstream. The gold liquid 
     twists into a long snaking tube up and down the limb. 
     It s the shape of a vein. The liquid begins to react. 
     Small flashes of light blip up and down the strand of 
     color. Ba-bump.. ba-bump... the heartbeat starts to speed 
     up.
                    SARAH
               Elevated heartbeat.
     INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH
     Janice analyzes the screens.
                    JANICE
               We re still in the green.
                    FRANK
               Confirmed. Vitals still in the normal 
               range.
     INT. LABORATORY
     The glowing liquid turns from gold to red as the complex 
     webbing of a bloodstream appears.
                    MATT
               It s reacting.
     Spreading out from the bloodstream, soon becomes 
     visible.. the shadow of a skeletal system.
                    SEBASTIAN
               Do you see this?
                    LINDA
               It s working. It s actually working. 
     Matt pulls the sheet back. Muscles are beginning to 
     appear. And eyeballs. Frightened eyeballs.
                    SARAH
               Heart rate s up. She s scared.
     Sarah soothes her.
                    SARAH (cont d)
               It's okay, baby. It's okay.
                    SEBASTIAN
               Subject began manifesting almost 
               Immediately. Protocol is reacting 
               quickly.
     Isabelle starts to struggle against her restraints. She 
     begins to howl.
                    LINDA
               Subject may be in pain or extreme 
               discomfort.
                    SARAH
               Goddamnit. Blood pressure elevating. 
               Brain activity going through the roof. 
     The brain appears, seemingly growing from the inside out. 
     The shape of a large half-formed monkey grows from the 
     inside out. A SKULL APPEARS howling in pain, in horror.
                    SARAH (cont d)
               We ve got a problem.
                    SEBASTIAN
               What? What problem!
     Sarah checks her monitors.
                    SARAH
               It s her heart. We can see the heart 
               beating in the ape s
                    FRANK (V.0.)
               I got an erratic heart beat.
                    SARAH
               She s going into cardiac arrest.
                    LINDA
               Got the crash cart.
     Carter charges the crash cart and rolls it in.
                    SARAH
               We re losing her.
     Her machine flatlines.
                    SEBASTIAN
               No! It s got to work.
     The body is only half there. It looks as if its caught in 
     decomposition. Linda rubs the cardiac paddles together.
                    LINDA
               Clear!
     Linda slams the paddles on the monkey s chest. The jolt 
     of electricity makes the monkey visible again for a brief 
     moment. Then the skin and flesh fade away again.
                    SARAH
               We ve got something!
     The heartbeat starts up again. The body continues its 
     march toward,visibility.
                    SARAH (cont d)
               Still. erratic.
                    LINDA
               Come on Isabelle. Come on. You can do 
               it. You can fucking do it.
     Everybody s pulling for her.
                    SARAH
               Come on, monkey.
                    MATT
               Do it. Do it. Come on.
     Muscles spread like a rash on bone as the monkey twists 
     and turns, frightened. Then skin. The monkey howls. Skin 
     forms over the muscles reappearing like it was being 
     painted on before our eyes.
                    SARAH
               Stabilizing.
     The entire form glows, then blinks, then glows again, as 
     if it was discharging some stored energy.
                    FRANK (V.0.)
               Brain activity returning to normal.
     The monkey grunts and groans. Blinks its eyes. Linda 
     hovers over it stroking its fur.
                    LINDA
               Welcome back, Isabelle.
     Sebastian puts his hand on Linda s shoulder... a move 
     that does not go unnoticed by Matt. We did it.
                    SEBASTIAN
                     (beat)
               How is she?
                    SARAH
                     (surprised)
               I think she s gonna be okay
                                        
     DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. HABITAT

     Frank, Matt, Sarah, Janice and Linda watch Isabelle rise 
     and walk about the cage. She goes over to the other 
     monkeys and joins in their grooming rituals.

                    CARTER
               Amazing. She's normal, absolutely 
               healthy. If you didn't know any 
               better, you'd think nothing had 
               happened to her.

                    MATT
                     (ribbing Sarah)
               Yeah. I can't wait to slice up her 
               brain and trace her neural pathways.

                    SARAH
               Screw you, Matt.

                    MATT
               Well maybe not right away.

                    LINDA
               We should celebrate.

     INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

     The fanciest one in D.C.

     The entire eight person team sits around a round table, 
     drunk and laughing, as the last champagne flute is 
     filled.

     Sebastian raises his glass.

                    SEBASTIAN
               To the finest research team I've ever 
               known.

     A round of "Hear, hears" and they all clink glasses and 
     drink.

     EXT. RESTAURANT BALCONY - LATER

     The din of the diners fades away as Linda slips out onto 
     the restaurant's balcony. She find Sebastian leaning 
     against a railing, breathing in the night air.

                    SEBASTIAN
               Hey...

                    LINDA
               I thought you'd gone.

                    SEBASTIAN
               Where would I go?

     He looks out over the sweep of the city, the twinkling 
     lights of D.C. and darkness of the Potomac river.

                    SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Twenty years ago there were no 
               computers, no fax machines, no cell 
               phones. I was just wondering what the 
               world will be like twenty years from 
               now... if what we're doing will change 
               everything.

                    LINDA
               A little "I am become death... the 
               shatterer of worlds"?

                    SEBASTIAN
               Something like that.

                    LINDA
               Since the day I met, all you wanted to 
               do was change the world.

     She puts her hand on his shoulder.

                    LINDA (cont'd)
               Listen, I know we've... I mean... well 
               ... I just want you to know how proud 
               I am of you. I know it probably 
               doesn't mean a lot...

                    SEBASTIAN
               Actually it does.
                     (beat)
               I guess since you were there from the 
               beginning, you know me better than 
               anyone else on this godforsaken 
               planet.

                    LINDA
               You're positively maudlin. You should 
               be happy. Do you have any idea what 
               you've accomplished?

                    SEBASTIAN
               Yeah... but I was working so hard, I 
               didn't realize I'd have no one to 
               share it with.

     Sebastian heads back inside. But he stops and turns back.

                    SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               I don't suppose we could turn back the 
               clock for a night and you could come 
               home with me?

     Her look says it all. Too much water under the bridge.

                    SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Right. Sorry. Too much champagne.

     He turns and heads back into the party. As he heads in he 
     passes Matt heading out. He and Sebastian exchange 
     "Heys".

                    MATT
               What was that about?

                    LINDA
               Nothing. It's just... He is who he is. 
               Sometimes I just have to be reminded.

                                             
     CUT TO:

     INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

     Sebastian wanders through the empty hallways of the 
     laboratory.

     INT. HALLWAY OF HABITATS - NIGHT

     Sebastian paces back and forth, examining the habitats. 
     He taps on the Plexiglas of one. The cubicle explodes 
     with

     BARKING.

     We see the Plexi steam up in one part, as if something 
     was breathing on it. As if a nose were pressed against 
     it.

                    SEBASTIAN
                     (a little drunk)
               What's it like? Talk goddamnit! Tell 
               me what it's like!

                                        
     DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. PENTAGON - DAY

     Flying over Washington D. C. , we cross the Potomac and 
     circle the five-cornered building, looking particularly 
     gloomy on this grey day.

                    SEBASTIAN (V.0.)
               Six years ago, this committee 
               commissioned me with a very specific 
               task...

     INT. PENTAGON CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

     At the table are six men. A handful of senior military 
     brass and top civilian advisors direct their attention to 
     the front of the room, where Sebastian, flanked by Matt 
     and Linda, is in the middle of his presentation.

                    SEBASTIAN
               To successful phase-shift a human 
               being out of quantum sync with the 
               visible universe and then return him 
               safely, with no after affects.

     Next to Sebastian a video shows a small monkey shifting 
     from the visible spectrum. It's hair, skin, organs and 
     skeletons slowly dissolve before our eyes.

                    SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Well, we found out sending them to 
               "never-never-land" was easy, it's the 
               getting back that's hard.

     Sebastian fast forwards a few moments until the video 
     screen shows the bizarrely tangled heap of flesh and bone 
     that used to be alive.

                    SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Every time we've tried to bring a test 
               subject back from phase-shift. 
               Cellular bonds would dissolve, the 
               primary DNA strands would decay. But 
               now...

     Sebastian pauses. Something's bothering him.

                    SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               But now...

     One of the senior advisers, DR. HARRY KRAMER, 
     distinguished 50s, finally breaks the silence.

                    KRAMER
               But now?

     Linda and Matt look up at Sebastian expectantly.

                    SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
               But now...
                     (pause)
               But now, we feel we are closer than 
               ever to resolving this issue. We've 
               been experimenting with a new 
               regression formula that looks rather 
               promising.
               A FOUR STAR GENERAL leans forward.

                    GENERAL
               How long?

                    SEBASTIAN
               Sir?

                    GENERAL
               Son, as you can imagine, we are very 
               anxious to field test this tactical 
               asset. How long till you resolve this 
               issue?

     Linda starts to speak, but Sebastian cuts her off with a 
     look.

                    SEBASTIAN
               Shouldn't be more than another year, 
               Sir.

     Frustrated sighs all around the room.

                    SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Maybe sooner.

     EXT. PENTAGON - DAY

     As Linda, Matt and Sebastian head to their cars.

                    MATT
               Yo. Reality check! What the hell was 
               that about?

                    SEBASTIAN
               Keep your voice down.

                    MATT
               The protocol works. Why'd you tell 
               them it didn't?

                    SEBASTIAN
               I wasn't ready for them to know.

                    MATT
               But they're the oversight committee. 
               They're supposed to know.

                    LINDA
               I'm sure he had a reason.
                     (firmly)
               You did have a reason, didn't you, 
               Sebastian?

                    SEBASTIAN
               I had more than a reason. I had a 
               goddamn epiphany.

     They reach his Porsche.

                    SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               What do you think they'd do if they 
               know we could send a subject into 
               phase shift and pull it back out 
               again? How many seconds would it take 
               for them to take over the whole 
               project, bringing in their soldiers to 
               test the formula on. We'd have lost 
               control of it by the end of the week.

                    LINDA
               It's their money, Sebastian. It's 
               going to happen eventually.

                    SEBASTIAN
               I know. But not yet. There's too much 
               for us to learn. I don't want my hands 
               tied by their political agenda when we 
               go to phase three.

                    MATT
               Well, then... mind telling us how 
               you're gonna get a human test-subject 
               for phase three without the committee 
               finding out?

                    SEBASTIAN
               That's easy. I've decided to test the 
               procedure ...

     INT. LABORATORY CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

                    SEBASTIAN
               ... on myself.

     The team sits around the conference table. Their jaws 
     drop and they stare at him with wide eyes.

                    FRANK
               Are you nuts?

                    SEBASTIAN
               Was Jonas Salk nuts?

                    FRANK
               Yeah. Pretty sure he was.

                    CARTER
               And remember, for every Jonas Salk, 
               there are a bunch of guys who aren't 
               famous cuz they died.

                    SEBASTIAN
               If we're that unsure, how can we 
               morally justify testing it on someone 
               else?

                    JANICE
               Isn't it a little soon to be moving 
               into phase three anyway?

                    SARAH
               She's right. We haven't even finished 
               collating the phase two research.

                    SEBASTIAN
               We'll have plenty of time to collate 
               and cross-reference later. Monkey data 
               doesn't matter anyway. The only real 
               data is human data.

                    SARAH
               You don't even know if any of the 
               protocols will work on humans.

                    SEBASTIAN
               How are we gonna find out? Besides, 
               we've succeeded with a gorilla and 
               their DNA is 98% the same as humans. 
               And the 2% is not that significant.

                    LINDA
               Sebastian ... humans can talk, build 
               houses and cook in microwave ovens. 
               Gorilla's live in trees. That's a 
               helluva 2% if you ask me.

                    SEBASTIAN
               We're all concerned. I know that. But 
               if we're gonna move forward ever, this 
               is something we have to do.

                    LINDA
               Why you? Why not one of us?

                    SEBASTIAN
               The risks. I couldn't ask...

                    MATT
                     (interrupting)
               What if we volunteer?

                    LINDA
               What if you're too valuable to lose?

                    SEBASTIAN
               I'm Project Leader. It's my formula 
               and my call. The best way to express 
               your concern is to make damn sure you 
               do your best work. I'll want about 
               four weeks to...

                    FRANK
               To put your affairs in order?

                    SEBASTIAN
               To run some more reversions and tissue 
               tests and then we'll attempt the phase 
               shift. I'll stay shifted for three 
               days of testing and then we'll perform 
               a quantum regression.

     INT. SEBASTIAN'S OFFICE

     A knock on the door.

                    SEBASTIAN
               Come in.

     Linda pushes into the room and closes the door behind 
     her.

                    SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               What?

                    LINDA
               In the past six years, I've never once 
               challenged your decisions, but this 
               ... Sebastian. I don't think you 
               should do this.

                    SEBASTIAN
               You don't understand.

                    LINDA
               Oh please. How long were we together? 
               You must've said it a million times 
               ... Nobody knows who built the lunar 
               lander. All they remember in the first 
               man on the moon.

     Sebastian shrugs and nods.

                    LINDA (cont'd)
               But what if something happens to 
               you... what about the project? 

     Sebastian smiles.

                    SEBASTIAN
               Lin, trust me... nothing's going to 
               happen.

     INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Linda and Matt are in bed together. Matt kisses her way 
     up and down her arm. But Linda is distracted.

                    LINDA
               He refuses to listen to reason.

                    MATT
               Can we talk about this later? I'm 
               trying to make love to you.

                    LINDA
               Sorry. I just can't let it go.

     Matt props himself up on the pillow.

                    MATT
               I know how you're feeling. Hell, he 
               and I've been friends since freshman 
               year.

                    LINDA
               So how can we let him do this?

                    MATT
               What if you were given the opportunity 
               to be the first person on ,Mars, would 
               you go?

                    LINDA
               In a heartbeat.

                    MATT
               What if they didn't know whether or 
               not they could get you home?

     Linda thinks about it. It's still tempting.

                    MATT (cont'd)
               This is his chance to be Chuck Yeager 
               or Christopher Columbus. Well, if I 
               were him I'd do the same thing.

     Matt goes back to kissing Linda.

                    LINDA
               Let me ask another question.

                    MATT
               Is about who gets to be on top?

                    LINDA
               Is the human race really ready for 
               what we're doing?

     Matt groans and rolls over.

                    MATT
               Why do you always get philosophical 
               before we're about to get physical?

                    LINDA
               No really. Is it ready? We're 
               barrelling down a road that begs moral 
               and ethical questions that I don't 
               think we can answer.

                    MATT
               They said the same thing about the 
               bomb. They said we'd never survive the 
               nuclear age... but here we are.

                    LINDA
               This night is still young.
                     (beat)
               I mean, when you think about it, it's 
               creepy. Do we really want to live in a 
               world where people can just disappear 
               in the blink of an eye?

                    MATT
               We made our deal with the devil years 
               ago. Might as well stick around to 
               cash in.

     INT. MEDICAL EXAMINING ROOM - DAY

     Sebastian stripped to his shorts paces nervously. A knock 
     on the door.

                    SEBASTIAN
                     (his voice catches)
               Yes?

     Matt sticks his head in.

                    MATT
               We're ready.

     Sebastian nervously shakes his limbs out. Then nods.

                    SEBASTIAN
               Okay.

                    MATT
               It's not too late to back out. I'm 
               happy to take your place.

                    SEBASTIAN
               No. I'm ready.

     Matt leads him into the hallway.

     INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

     As they walk down the corridor toward the lab...

                    MATT
               Nervous?

                    SEBASTIAN
               A little.

                    MATT
               Ever tell you the one about Superman 
               and Wonder Woman?

                    SEBASTIAN
               I don't think so.

                    MATT
               So Superman's flying around the city, 
               and he's horny as hell.  Lo and behold 
               he looks down and sees Wonder Woman, 
               completely nude, sunning herself up on 
               the roof of the Justice League. I mean 
               she is lying there naked and spread 
               eagle. So Superman starts thinking, 
               "man... this is too easy. I could go 
               down there, do a little fast pumping 
               and be gone before she even sees me." 
               After all he is faster than a speeding 
               bullet, right? Anyway, he swoops down, 
               takes care of business so quick, you 
               can't even see him. Well ... I tell 
               ya. Wonder Woman looks up, surprised 
               as hell and says "What the hell was 
               that." And the Invisible Man replies 
               "I dunno know, but it sure hurt like 
               hell."

     INT. LABORATORY

     Sebastian shoots Matt a look.

                    SEBASTIAN
               You know, that could be the last joke 
               I ever hear.

                    MATT
               C'mon, man. That's funny shit.

     The buzz of conversation is punctuated by an amplified 
     HEARTBEAT, thumping its familiar rhythm. Bah-bump. 
     Bah-bump. In the center of the room, Sebastian, dressed 
     only in a pair of jogging shorts is strapped to a table 
     inclined at a 45 degree angle. Electrodes are strapped to 
     his body. An I.V. tube snakes from the needle in his vein 
     up to a bag of saline solution. Dripping slowly. Linda 
     makes last minute checks of some of the equipment. She 
     pats Sebastian on the shoulder.

                    LINDA
               O.K. How're you feeling?
               
               Sebastian takes a deep breath.

                    SEBASTIAN
               Fine.

     Sarah checks his vitals.

                    SARAH
               Pulse 88, BP 140 over 95. A bit 
               elevated.

                    SEBASTIAN
               To be expected.

                    SARAH
               No reason for concern. He's ready. 

     Linda takes a moment and studies Sebastian's face. She's 
     almost teary eyed.

                    SEBASTIAN
               Hey... it's gonna be okay.

     Linda nods. Back to business.

                    LINDA
               Start recording.

     INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH.

     Janice hits record on the equipment decks.

                    JANICE
               We're hot. All systems nominal, 
               Houston.

     Frank coordinates all the data being fed into the 
     computers. He pushes a series of buttons and speaks into 
     a microphone.

                    FRANK
               Okay, kids. Let's make some history.

     INT. LABORATORY - DAY

     Frank's voice echoes through the chamber.

                    LINDA
               Subject: Male, Age 29, weight 166 lbs. 

     Matt jabs a hypodermic into small vial of colored liquid. 
     Draws up 20ccs.

                    MATT
                     (to Linda)
               Ready.

     Linda takes the hypo from Matt.

                    MATT (cont'd)
               If the tests are any indication it 
               should work quickly.

                    SEBASTIAN
               I'll inject myself. If anything goes 
               wrong, they can't blame you.

     She hands the hypo Sebastian and steps away. Sebastian 
     stares at the golden formula silently for a moment.

                    LINDA
               We can still shut down, Sebastian.

     He shakes his head.

                    MATT
               Any last words?

                    SEBASTIAN
               Yeah. If I'm killed, pretend I said 
               something deep and clever. 

     Then... Back to business. He inserts the needle into the 
     I.V. Sebastian. Presses into himself and depresses the 
     plunger.

                    LINDA
               Injection was administered at
                     (checks watch)
               ... 18:23:47.

     The colored liquid snakes it's way into his bloodstream.

                    LINDA (cont'd)
               Keep talking. Tell us what you're 
               feeling.

                    SEBASTIAN
               Nothing so far.

                    SARAH
               Vitals are stable.

     They wait and watch.

                    LINDA
               Nothing's happening.

     Another moment passes by.

                    MATT
               Human DNA structure is slightly more 
               complex... it's possible that it may 
               take more time...

     Another moment passes.

                    LINDA
               Maybe we overlooked something.

                    SEBASTIAN
               Recheck the protocol. It can't be non- 
               reactive.

                    CARTER
               Kinda like a firecracker with a bad 
               fuse...

     Sebastian shoots Carter a questioning look.

                    CARTER (cont'd)
               Don't know if it'll go off.

                    LINDA
               Frank?

                    FRANK (V.0.)
                     (from the booth)
               No change in bio-electric.

                    SEBASTIAN
               Goddammit.

     Another long pause. Sebastian concentrates.

                    SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Okay wait, my arm... it's getting a 
               bit warm... yeah, it's ... it's 
               starting to tingle...

     Excitement overtakes the room.

                    SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Okay... it's spreading to my back... 
               like, like a fever...

                    LINDA
               Here we go.

     Slowly the flesh on Sebastian's arm begins dissolving, 
     revealing the complex network of nerves, blood vessels 
     and flesh beneath it.

                    SEBASTIAN
               Shit... it's starting to burn... Oh 
               god. It hurts. I didn't think it would 
               hurt.

     The HEART BEAT thumps faster, accelerating

                    SARAH
               Heartbeat's elevated. Pulse at 100.
               ... 130 ...

                    LINDA
               What do you feel? Keep talking. KEEP 
               TALKING!

                    SEBASTIAN
               Pain!

                    SARAH
               Pulse is 165 ... 170 Blood pressure 
               180 over 100. ... 

                    CARTER
               He's going to blow out his heart.

                    LINDA
               Prop the crash cart.

     Carter grabs the crash cart, rolls it in. Matt tears off 
     the I.V. leads into Sebastian's arms.

                    MATT
               We've got to stop it!

                    LINDA
               We can't!

     INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH

     All the monitors are going crazy.

                    JANICE
               Something's happening.

     Frank leans into the microphone.

                    FRANK
               Listen up! Electric activity 
               increasing in all limbs. Brainwaves 
               are through the roof.

                    JANICE
               I didn't think the human brain could 
               spike that high.

                    FRANK
               Maybe it can't.

     INT. LABORATORY

     Sebastian screams in dire pain. He struggles against his 
     restraints as his skin liquefies into a muscular mass. 
     It's like something's eating away at him. Gruesome. The 
     yells become louder and more painful to hear.

                    SEBASTIAN
               No. Oh god! NO! STOP IT! STOP IT!

     The muscular system begins to dissolve, leaving a 
     struggling skeleton wrapped with tentacular blood vessels 
     and stuffed with the major organs. The beating heart, the 
     heaving lungs.

                    SARAH
               Pulse is 180 .... holding stable. 

     Screaming.... Then the organs go. Then the blood vessels. 
     Leaving only a skeleton howling in pain. The jawbones 
     spread wide ... Screaming... screaming...

                    CARTER
                Holy shit.

     Then as if someone had poured acid all over the bones, 
     the skeleton evaporates into nothingness.

                    SARAH
               Pulse is dropping. 170..
               150 .... 160..

     There is NOTHING left of Sebastian Caine.

                    LINDA
               Bio-quantum phase shift occurred at
               18:26.

     The screaming continues and the restraints continue to 
     twist and turn. Suddenly the restraints go limp.

                    MATT
               Is he dead?

     Linda checks the readouts.

                    LINDA
               No. He passed out from the trauma.

                    SARAH
               Vitals returning to normal. Pulse 110 
               ... dropping. Blood pressure 130 over 
               75.

     A long beat as everybody's eyes stare at the instruments.

                    FRANK (V.O.)
               Electrical activity is stabilizing.

                    SARAH
               Pulse steady at 70.

     A long beat.

                    MATT
               Un-fucking-believable.

     A reverent pause as Linda runs her fingers over what 
     would be his skin. Small electrical charge dance around 
     her fingertips. She gasps.

                    LINDA
                     (whispers in his ear)
               You did it, Sebastian. You're the 
               first.

                    CARTER
               Let's get him into recovery.

                                        
     DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER

     The chamber is half constructed out of Plexiglas at the 
     end of the Hallway of Habitats.

     On the recovery bed, a sheet drapes over Sebastian's 
     invisible body. The gentle bleatings of medical machinery 
     pound out a dulling rhythm.

     Linda sleeps in a corner chair as Matt slips into the 
     room. He checks the readouts on Sebastian then takes a 
     seat by Linda. She wakes with a start.

                    MATT
               S'okay. You nodded off.

                    LINDA
               His breathing's hypnotic. How long's 
               it been?

                    MATT
               Seventeen hours.

                    LINDA
               Where are the others?

                    MATT
               In the lab crunching numbers. We've 
               got enough data there for two 
               lifetimes of research.

     Linda rubs her temples and gestures to the bed.

                    LINDA
               I keep looking at that hole, wondering 
               if he's really there.

     She notices something out of the corner of his eye. The 
     sheet twitches.

                    LINDA (cont'd)
               Did you see...

     The sheet twitches again.

                    MATT
               He may be coming out of it.

     Linda and Matt watch intently. Then suddenly... the 
     sheets thrash violently. A yell of pain.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               The lights! Turn off the goddamn 
               lights! Ah Christ!

     Linda jumps up and crosses to Sebastian. Matt rushes to 
     the wall and turns off the lights. Darkness. The room is 
     lit by the glow of machinery.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
               I can't... I can't close my eyes. I 
               can't close my eyes.

                    LINDA
               Your eyelids are transparent.

     The sheets slowly stop thrashing.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               So I ... I'm...

                    LINDA
               Yes.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               My arms. I can.. where? ... I can feel 
               them...

                    LINDA
               Your arms ... your whole body... It 
               worked, Sebastian. It worked.

     The sheet rises and slips away. The wires, seemingly 
     connected to thin air, spread out like a spider's web and 
     then fall away one-by-one. The monitors all go dead.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               Mirror. I ... I want to see.

                    MATT
               Over here in the corner.

     Matt motions to a dark corner of the room, toward a 
     mirror and sink. We push in on the mirror. No reflection. 
     Suddenly it fogs up ... Sebastian's breath. A finger 
     tracing appears in the fog ... but of course we see no 
     finger. The sink faucet twists on and water runs. It cups 
     into the shape of hands and lifts into the air, splashing 
     against the surface of Sebastian's face. Beads of water 
     cling to his f ace, outlining it I shape f or a moment 
     before dripping away.

                    MATT (cont'd)
               What was it like?

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               I ... It's hard to think.

     Sebastian's voice is now behind him. Matt turns around.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
               The transformation... I remember every 
               molecule in my body shattering.

                    MATT
               It was painful?

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               At first... but then everything went 
               black. I couldn't see or hear or feel 
               anything. It was all just black... 
               like I wasn't connected.

                    LINDA
               Your system received quite a shock.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               At least my senses are starting to 
               return... You're wearing your 
               Shalimar, aren't you?

     Linda realizes that he's standing very close by. Her hair 
     lifts slightly and Sebastian inhales. Chills go down her 
     spine.

                    LINDA
               Sebastian.

     Linda's hair drops back to her shoulders.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               This is weird. I'm looking through 
               myself at the floor. I'm looking right 
               through myself. I can't tell ...

     He bumps into a chair.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
               ... where my body is.

     A moment of silence.

                    LINDA
               Sebastian?

     No answer. Linda and Matt look at each other, slightly 
     alarmed.

                    MATT
               Sebastian?

     An indentation forms on the bed a moment later.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               You really can't see me. Can you?

                    LINDA
               Gimme symptoms. Dizziness, nausea, 
               headache, body-ache, disorientation.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               No, just tired.
                     (beat)
               It's funny. I can see everything... 
               more than before... but I can't see 
               myself.

     INT. LABORATORY - DAY

     Carter, Frank, Janice and Sarah work at various research 
     stations. The door opens and Linda and Matt enter.

                    CARTER
               Hey. How's he doing?

                    LINDA
               Why don't you ask him?

     Linda motions to the gap between her and Matt. The four 
     of them stare at the nothing.

                    SARAH
               Sebastian, how do you feel.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               Not to bad, considering.

     They turn round. The voice is coming from behind them. 
     The group rises from their various workstations and turn 
     toward where the voice came from.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
               Odd, isn't it?

     A rheostat switch on the wall turns and the lights dim. 
     Though it's a simple act, it feels somewhat ominous.

                    LINDA
               He can't close his eyes so they're 
               sensitive to light.

     Linda's explanation puts everyone at ease.

                    JANICE
               So, what was it like?

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               Over here.

     Sebastian has moved. As everyone turns toward him again, 
     he can't stifle a slight giggle.

                    LINDA
               C'mon Sebastian. Knock it off.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               Sorry. Couldn't resist.

     His voice again come s from somewhere else in the room.

                    FRANK
               I feel like we're playing Marco Polo.

                    MATT
               Well, I see the procedure hasn't 
               changed your personality.

     Frank pulls on a pair of THERMAL GOGGLES.

                    FRANK
               No worries. I'm on it.

     THERMAL POV - Every body in the laboratory shows up as a 
     heat signature, including Sebastian. Frank points.

                    FRANK (cont'd)
               Gotcha, big man.

     THERMAL POV - The HEAT SIGNATURE reaches for a chair.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               Boy, you people have no sense of 
               humor.

     A chair slides back from a desk and bends under 
     Sebastian's weight.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
               Show me. So ...

                                             
     CUT TO:

     INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

     Frank and Janice shuttle the playback controls as a VIDEO 
     MONITOR re-plays various angles of Sebastian's phase 
     shift.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               Stop there.

     Frank halts the tape.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
               Index that. That was when it started 
               burn. Epidermal reaction.

                    JANICE
               Index Mark. 112125.

     Janice scribble the numbers in her notebook. Linda 
     crosses, nursing a cup of coffee.

                    LINDA
               It's late. Time you got some rest.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               Just a little longer.

                    LINDA
               Hate to pull rank, but you're my 
               patient now and you need rest. We've 
               got a busy day tomorrow.

     Heavy sigh.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               Fine.

     

     INT. THE RECOVERY ROOM - NIGHT

     As Linda enters she points to a small camera in the upper 
     corner of the room.

                    LINDA
               We've set up a thermal camera for 
               observation and I've arranged one of 
               us to be here 24/7 in case you need 
               anything. The team's gonna be on alpha-
               call alert for the duration. If 
               anything goes wrong, we can all be 
               here within...

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               Thirty minutes. Yes,,_I know. I wrote 
               the procedure.

                    LINDA
               I was trying to be reassuring.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               You like this don't you?

                    LINDA
               What's that?

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               Being in charge.

     It's clear she does. But she's certainly not going to 
     admit it.

                    LINDA
               Please. I'm just doing my job.

                                             
     CUT TO:

     CLOSE ON: A video screen. A thermal lump lays stretched 
     out on the bed.

     Pull back to reveal SARAH staring at the screen. We are.

     INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

     A bank of monitors display the various angles of the Hall 
     of Habitats, the laboratory and, of course, Sebastian in 
     the recovery room.

     Linda hands Sarah a cup of coffee.

                    LINDA
               You gonna be okay?

                    SARAH
               Fine. It's not like I have anything 
               else going on in my sad pathetic life.

                    LINDA
               Carter'll be in at six to spell you 
               and I'll be in by nine. Call me if 
               anything happens, okay?

     Through the glass wall, Linda sees Matt knocking and 
     waving her out.

                    SARAH
               I'm fine. Go on ahead.

     INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

     The rest of the team straggles into the elevator. 
     Yawning. Exhausted from the day.

                    CARTER
               Man, I'm tired. That was a long day.

                    LINDA
               Days only get longer from here.

     Linda catches Matt's eye. Gives him a look. "You coming 
     over?" Matt nods, "yes", imperceptible to everyone but 
     Linda. She smiles.

     Deserted and dark.

     INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

     Late. Sarah rubs her temples. Her eyelids are heavy. 
     She's having real trouble staying awake. The buzzing 
     fluorescent light isn't helping either.

     INT. RECOVERY ROOM - NIGHT

     The sheets ruffle and the indentation disappears from the 
     bed. We can hear breathing and soft sound of bare feet 
     shuffling against linoleum.

     CAMERA SLOWLY PANS toward the door, as if we, are 
     following someone walking.

     The door handle turns and the door pushes open.

     INT. HALLWAY OF HABITATS - NIGHT

     WE SLOWLY TRACK DOWN the Hallway of the Habitats. We hear 
     the sounds of sleeping creatures. A couple of them growl 
     at something unseen. The growling follows the invisible 
     something as it passes by.

     INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

     The laboratory door opens and shuts again. Ghostly. We 
     see papers shuffling at one of the work stations. A glass 
     moves slightly.

     INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

     Sarah reclines in her chair. Fast asleep, Behind her is 
     the glass wall, revealing the empty hallway behind it.

     But a small portion of the glass fogs, as if someone had 
     just breathed on it. As the fogged part quickly clears, 
     we see the door to the observation room quietly open.

     ON SARAH, still sleeping. We hear a whisper.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
                     (whispering)
               Sarah. Are you awake?

     Her heavy breathing mixes with Sebastian's.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
                     (barely audible)
               Hmm.

     Sarah's hair moves slightly, as if a hand were running 
     through it. And then we see her shirt move, like fingers 
     were tracing over it. Down from the shoulder to her 
     breast. Around her nipple. Sarah moans slightly, as if 
     she were dreaming, but she doesn't stir. And then her 
     breasts cup slightly, as if they were being touched... 
     softly... gently. Her breathing becomes harder, more 
     labored, erotic... and then she... BOLTS AWAKE. Bar eyes 
     wide with fear. She jumps and cups her own breasts and 
     looks around the room. It's empty, of course. She jumps 
     over to the monitor and checks on Sebastian's room. The 
     heat signature isn't there.

                    SARAH
               Dr. Caine! Goddamnit, Dr. Caine! Are 
               you in here?

     She listens. It's silent. She tries holding her breath, 
     listening for his breathing. But there's nothing.

     Sarah reaches over to a microphone. Hits a few switches.

                    SARAH (cont'd)
               Dr. Caine?

     VARIOUS SHOTS OF THE COMPOUND

     - LABORATORY

                    SARAH (V.0.,LOUDSPEAKER)
               Dr. Caine, please report in.

     - HALLWAY OF HABITATS

                    SARAH (V.0.,LOUDSPEAKER)
               Dr. Caine, report in please!

     INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

     Sarah waits. No response.

                    SARAH
               Shit. 

     She looks around the room. He must be in here.

                    SARAH (cont'd)
               Dr. Caine? Sebastian? Come on, this 
               isn't funny. I know you're in here. 

     Nothing. No response. Sarah waves her hand around, 
     reaching out, trying to find him. After a few beats she 
     stops and rubs her head.

                    SARAH (cont'd)
               I must be going crazy.

     Suddenly, Sarah gets an idea. She quickly exits the 
     observation room.

     EXT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

     At a wall storage box, she removes a pair of Thermal 
     Goggles and slips them on.

     INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

     Sarah enters wearing the thermals. She scans the room.

     THERMAL POV - The room is empty.

     She pulls the goggles off in frustration, and when she 
     glances over at the video screen, she sees Sebastian's 
     thermal image lying on the bed in the recovery room.

     Sarah sinks into her chair, a tad disconcerted.

     INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - MORNING

     Linda and Matt finish listening to Sarah's story.

                    SARAH
               I found him later in the lab, running 
               samples.

                    LINDA
               Why didn't you call me?

                    SARAH
               Because I wasn't sure. I'm still not. 
               I mean, I could've easily been 
               dreaming.

                    MATT
               It doesn't sound like something 
               Sebastian would do.

                    SARAH
               God, I feel so stupid.

                    LINDA
               I can talk to him.

                    SARAH
               No. I mean...
                     (she torn, unsure of herself)
               It was probably nothing. I 
               shouldn't've mentioned it.

                    MATT
               You sure?

                    SARAH
               Yeah, I'm sure. I mean, y'know, why 
               would he do that, right? Just, this 
               place at night can be kinda creepy, 
               y'know.

     INT. RESEARCH LAB - DAY

     Sebastian, wearing surgical scrubs sits in an examination 
     chair. Wire leads sprout from the electrodes covering his 
     head and arms. The electrodes seem to outline his body.

                    MATT
               So, how was your first night?

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               Restless. Hard to sleep when you can't 
               close your eyes.

     As Sebastian talks, we can see the electrodes around his 
     jaw pump up and down.

                    MATT
               Yeah? What'd you do?

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               Got up a couple of times. Knocked 
               about.

                    MATT
               Yeah, Sarah mentioned you weren't in 
               your cubicle. She said she called you 
               over the intercom and you didn't 
               respond.

                    SEBASTIAN
               I guess I didn't hear. I had the radio 
               on.

                    MATT
               It'd be helpful to us if you'd tell 
               whoever's on duty where you're going 
               to. I mean, if something were to 
               happen, we'd want to know where to 
               find you.

                    SEBASTIAN
               I didn't think it was a problem.

                    MATT
               It isn't. I just don't want it to 
               become one.

     Machines pump out EEG, EKG readouts. Matt studies them.

                    MATT (cont'd)
               Readings are normal.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               Next I want to run a VV and UVF 
               analysis of the platelets.

                    MATT
               We'll have to draw some more blood.

                                             
     CUT TO:

     Sarah rolls up Sebastian's sleeve, revealing empty air. 
     She wraps a bungee cord around the nothing, pulls it 
     tight and sprays the inside of his elbow with dye. She 
     acts very self conscious.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               You okay?

                    SARAH
               Yeah. Why?

                    SEBASTIAN
               You just seem a little nervous.

                    SARAH
               No. I...I'm fine. Hold still. This 
               might hurt a bit.

     The surface of his skin sheens in the light as Linda 
     searches for a vein. She slaps his arm several times, 
     then plunges a hypodermic needle into his skin. His skin 
     bends and gives. The needle remains in sight after it 
     slips through the visible surface. Sarah presses down on 
     the hypo plunger, releasing a dye into his bloodstream.

                    SARAH (cont'd)
               Dr. Caine... this might sounds stupid, 
               but are you... are you looking at me. 

     The red dye twists into a long snaking red tube up and 
     down his arm. His vein.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               No. I was looking at the clock. Why? 

     Sarah draws the plunger back, sucking Sebastian's blood 
     into the hypodermic and then yanks the needle out.

                    SARAH
               Just felt like someone was staring at 
               me.

     Sarah pulls the vial off the needle and labels it with a 
     grease pencil. After a few beats the red dye in 
     Sebastian's blood stream dissolves and disappears, as 
     does the liquid in the vial.

     TESTING MONTAGE

     INT. MRI ROOM

     MATT slides Sebastian's sheet covered frame into an MRI. 
     Even though his head is not visible, it shown up on the 
     MRI scanner.

     INT. MAIN LABORATORY

     CARTER and SARAH lower a harness into a water tank. 
     SEBASTIAN'S BODY displaces the water, revealing an empty 
     body shaped cavity in the water.

     INT. OBSERVATION ROOM

     CARTER sips a BIG GULP and stares at a monitor which 
     shows two eat signatures in the Recovery Chamber, huddled 
     over a chess game.

     INT. RECOVER CHAMBER

     on a chessboard... A BLACK KNIGHT takes WHITE BISHOP, 
     seemingly all by itself.

     Across the table, Matt leans back and topples his WHITE 
     KING acknowledging defeat.

     INT. SPECTRAL LAB

     Dim lights. Janice and Frank both don eye guards. Frank 
     switches on a low intensity laser on and it's beam shoots 
     across the room. The beam distorts slightly in the center 
     of the room. As Frank widens the spectral pattern, 
     suddenly the beam splits into a million different 
     spectral rainbows, momentary illuminating Sebastian's 
     entire frame in a glowing tingle of light.

     INT. MAIN LABORATORY

     LINDA pulls vials from the cyclotrons and props blood 
     sample slides. She slips them under the microscope. She 
     takes a sip of her Diet Coke and puts it on the table. 
     She pears into the microscope and analyses the blood 
     sample, squeezing more stain onto it. She looks up to 
     make notations, but when she reaches for her Diet Coke IT 
     ISN'T THERE. She looks around. It's on the other side of 
     her microscope. She shrugs it off, she takes a sip and 
     sets it down where it was before. She peers into the 
     microscope again and when she looks up... the Diet Coke 
     is gone. She looks around the room and sees it on another 
     table completely.

                    LINDA
               Sebastian? Goddamnit.

     We hear Sebastian's laughter echo in the room.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               You've no idea how much fun I've had. 
               I'm going to hate going back.

                    LINDA
               That's what worries me.?

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               How so?

                    LINDA
               What happens when we turn the project 
               over to the Army. Ever wonder how much 
               fun they're gonna have?

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               Maybe we won't give it to them. His 
               voice comes from behind her now.

     We see indentations on her shoulders where his fingers 
     press down.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
               I was thinking... tonight's my last 
               night. Ever fantasize about making 
               love to an invisible man?

     Linda pulls away from him.

                    LINDA
               Stop it, Sebastian. It's not funny.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               Well, don't do it for me. Do it for 
               science. 

     Linda walks away. Sebastian laughs.

                    LINDA
               Grow up.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               Oh well. Missed your big chance.

                    LINDA
               Got some sleep. Big day tomorrow.

     INT. LABORATORY - DAY

     A bevy of activity below us as the scientists prepare. 
     Matt slides the antigen cocktail into the centrifuge and 
     starts it spinning.

     A sheet drapes over a Sebastian's frame, straps across 
     his limbs. He is fully wired.

     Linda looks up to the observation booth.

                    LINDA
               Recording?

     Frank peers down at her from the booth, his voice echoing 
     through the chamber.

                    FRANK
               Recording. Subject Doctor Sebastian 
               Caine. Currently in phase shift... 
               Three days, seven hours.

                    LINDA
               De-Phase protocol. Injecting Serial 
               Protein Caine One Two Seven.

     Matt removes the glowing vial of orange liquid from a 
     centrifuge nearby. Carter hands Matt a hypo. Matt jabs it 
     into the vial, drawing up the colored liquid. Linda 
     sprays Sebastian's arm with dye.

                    LINDA (cont'd)
               Ready?

                    SEBASTIAN
               Not really. I was just starting to 
               enjoy myself.

                    LINDA
               Tough.

                    MATT
               Okay, man. Here we go.

     Matt inserts the hypo into the vein and presses down on 
     the plunger. The liquid begins to react. Small flashes of 
     light blip up and down the strand of color outlining the 
     vein.

     Ba-bump.. ba-bump... the heartbeat starts to speed up.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               Wait... something... something doesn't 
               feel right.

                    SARAH
               Heartbeat elevated.


     INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH

     Janice and Frank look over the equipment.

                    FRANK
               Vitals still nominal..

     INT. LABORATORY

     The glowing liquid turns from gold to red as the complex 
     webbing of a bloodstream appears.

     Spreading out from the bloodstream, soon becomes visible 
     ... the shadow of a skeletal system.

                    SEBASTIAN
               I can't br... br...

     Sebastian begins wheezing.

                    LINDA
               What's wrong?

                    SARAH
               He's not breathing.

     Muscles are beginning to appear. And eyeballs. Frightened 
     eyeballs.

                    MATT
               Subject manifesting.

                    SARAH
               Pulse erratic.

     Sebastian pulls against his bonds. One set tears off.

                    LINDA
               Carter!

     Carter grabs onto the mass of flesh and muscle, trying to 
     hold it back. But the restraints snap. The half-visible 
     man is screaming. He grabs Carter and throws him across 
     the room.

                    LINDA (cont'd)
               Sebastian! Sebastian!

     And just for a second, Sebastian is fully visible. And 
     free. He looks around like a scared animal and rips off 
     all the wiring.

                    LINDA (cont'd)
               Sebastian!

                    MATT
               Get a tranq. Stat.

     Sarah preps a tranquilizer. Sebastian locks eyes with 
     Linda. He's lost, he doesn't know where he is. And 
     suddenly, he crumbles to the ground. Linda rushes over to 
     him and puts bar hand on his shoulder. Light bleeds from 
     his skin and his skin begins to dissolve from sight.

                    LINDA
               He's reverting. Got him on the table. 

     Matt, Linda and Sarah pull the shifting body up and onto 
     an operating table. Carter pulls himself up and heads 
     back to the group.

                    LINDA (cont'd)
               Get me a I.V. of A.G. seven.

                    SARAH
               I got no pulse. No pulse.

                    MATT
               Start CPR.

     Carter locates Sebastian's heart, not a difficult thing 
     because we can actually see it. Carter's hand pushes down 
     in the air inches above the heart. We see the heart being 
     pushed and squeezed. Sarah slaps an air bag on Sebastian 
     and starts pumping air into his lungs. Sebastian's heart 
     begins to beat again, beat on its own.

                    CARTER
               Getting a pulse.

                    MATT
               Holy shit. What happened?

                    LINDA
               Sebastian... can you hear me? Can you 
               hear me? How are his pupils?

                    MATT
               I can't see his goddamn pupils!

                    SARAH
               I think he's going into shock.

     We slowly FADE OUT to the sights and sounds of our 
     scientist- doctors working on Sebastian... And the 
     beeping of Sebastian's erratic heartbeat.

                                              FADE 
UP ON:

     A HABITAT

     The heartbeat continues. In the shadows, two Rhesus 
     Monkeys defend themselves against an unseen attacker. 
     Blood splatters against the Plexiglas wall.

     We FADE OUT AGAIN...

     INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

     Linda stares through the Plexiglas walls into the 
     Recovery Chamber. Inside the Chamber, Sarah and Carter-
     eye the various screens monitoring Sebastian's vitals.

     Linda watches the hollow pocket underneath the blanket. 
     She watches the rhythm of its rises and falls as 
     Sebastian sleeps. Matt comes up behind her.

                    MATT
               Just got the tissue sample results. 
               Cellular cohesion is stable.

     Linda exhales in relief. Matt puts his hands on her 
     shoulder. Pulls her close to him.

                    MATT (cont'd)
               How bout you? You gonna be okay?

                    LINDA
               Guess so.
                     (beat)
               I was just thinking about the Apollo 
               missions. Y'know? Grissom, White and 
               Chaffee... What it was like for them 
               on that launch pad that day, thinking 
               they were gonna reach the stars only 
               to burn to death.

                    MATT
               Sometimes the test pilots make 
               history. Sometimes the planes crash 
               and people die.

                    LINDA
               But he didn't die, did he?
                     (beat)
               What if we can't bring him back? What 
               then?

                    MATT
               It's just a little hitch is all. He'll 
               be the first to tell that he'll crack 
               it and I'm sure he will. It'll just 
               take time.
                     (beat)
               Listen, let's got out of here. We 
               could drive up to the old observatory. 
               We'll take some wine and go count the 
               stars and forget all this for awhile. 

     She pulls away.

                    LINDA
               No. I want to be here for him.

     Linda pushes through the door of the recovery chamber and 
     takes a seat by Sebastian's bedside. A little hurt, Matt 
     heads down the corridor.

     INT. CONFERENCE ROOM

     Frank and Janice are staring into their coffee when Matt 
     enters. Matt crosses to the coffee machine and pours 
     himself a cup. He takes a seat at the table. They all 
     drink their coffee in silent vigil.

     INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - DAY

     Linda sits by Sebastian's bedside, listening to the 
     constant rhythm of the machines.

     The sheets shift.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
                     (weak)
               Hey...

                    LINDA
               Hey...

     

                    SEBASTIAN 
               So I guess it didn't work.

     Linda shakes her head.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               You look worried. It must've been bad. 

     Sebastian's voice is weak and strained.

                    LINDA
               You almost died.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               Well, remember your Nietchze. Whatever 
               doesn't kill me, makes me stronger. 

     Linda smiles.

                    LINDA
               I should be making you feel better. 
               Not vice versa.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               I guess if I'm going to be stuck this 
               way for awhile, I'd better make some 
               adjustments.

     INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - DAY

     In a dusty shaft of light...

     A cotton swab.

     is dipped by a gloved hand into a jar of flesh-colored 
     cream make-up. We follow the hand as it raises the cotton 
     swab into the darkness. The swab strokes over the black 
     and the rich fleshy cream spreads, revealing...

     EYE LIDS of a closed eye.

     The eyelids part, unveiling...

     PITCH BLACK. Blink. Blink.

     No eye.

     Not even a trace of a eye socket. Just darkness.

     A COLORED CONTACT LENS floats through mid-air... hovering 
     before the eyelids. It turns and fastens itself to the 
     darkness between the lids.

     We PULL BACK slowly as Sebastian lifts a latex FACE MASK 
     and pulls it over his head.

     He checks his reflection in the mirror. He looks almost 
     human. Almost. A face, eyes, hands ... the rest of him 
     covered by surgical scrubs.

     We pull back and see the rest of the team looking on.

                    MATT
               Not too bad.

                    SEBASTIAN
               The latex'll limit the amount of light 
               delivered to my optic nerves.

                    LINDA
               You could almost pass for human. 

     Sebastian rises. He looks eerily removed from reality 
     with his cold blank expression.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               Well, it gives you a face to talk to 
               at least, and we can all work in 
               normal light again.

     INT. LABORATORY - DAY

     SERIES OF SHOTS

     Carter draws blood from Sebastian.

     Samples are placed into the cyclotron.

     Matt peers through the eyepiece of a microscope. He makes 
     notes.

     Frank and Janice finish a computer simulation on a 
     protein strand. Matt looks over. They shake their heads, 
     no.

     Sebastian slides into the MRI.

     Linda examines a petri dish. She throws her pencil down 
     in frustration.

     Sebastian is hit by the spectral radiation beams.

     Matt pulls a vial of orange liquid from the cyclotron.

     INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

     Sebastian, still in his latex and scrubs, but looking 
     like he's been dragged through the nine levels of 
     purgatory, is escorted back to the recovery chamber by 
     Linda and Matt.

     He crosses to his bed and collapses on it. Closes his 
     eyes.

                    SEBASTIAN
               The testing's making me sick.

                    LINDA
               Could be the barium or the radiation.

                    MATT
               You're physiology has changed and, 
               well, all bets are off.

                    SEBASTIAN
               I can't believe I have to spend 
               another night here.
                     (to Linda)
               Suppose you're gonna go home now, meet 
               up with that boyfriend of yours now. 

     Linda and Matt exchange a glance. Linda quickly covers.

                    LINDA
               Do you want me to stay?

                    SEBASTIAN
               No. That's okay. It's just, being a 
               guinea pig is more work than I 
               thought. I'll be fine.

     INT. RESEARCH COMPOUND - NIGHT

     Various shots of the empty hallways and deserted labs.

     INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

     Carter kicks back in his chair listening to his walkman 
     stereo and playing gameboy.

     INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - DAY

     Sebastian, in scrubs and make-up, paces back and forth.

     He slams the wall in frustration. He crosses to a mirror 
     and examines himself. He doesn't look half bad. He pokes 
     his cheeks. There's something about him that's a little 
     off, but only if you look close.

     INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

     A shadow falls across Carter's face. He looks up. It's 
     Sebastian wearing street clothes - jeans and a hooded 
     sweatshirt over his latex mask.

     Carter pulls of his earphones.

                    CARTER
                     (surprised)
               Dr. Caine. What's up?

                    SEBASTIAN
               Just stopped by to let you know, I'm 
               going out for a bit.

     Sebastian turns back into the hallway.

                    CARTER
               Going out? Hey wait a sec!

     Carter scrambles to his feet.

     INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

     Carter catches up with Sebastian.

                    CARTER
               What do you mean going out for a bit?

                    SEBASTIAN
               If I don't get out of here, I'm gonna 
               go crazy.

                    CARTER
               But you're not supposed to leave the 
               compound.

                    SEBASTIAN
               Why not?

                    CARTER
               That's the rule.

                    SEBASTIAN
               Yes, but I made that rule. It's my 
               rule and I'm changing it.

                    CARTER
               You can't just change it.

     Sebastian hits the elevator button. The doors open.

                    SEBASTIAN
               Carter, I was suppose to be like this 
               for three days. Three fucking days and 
               I'll be damned if I'm going to spend 
               the rest of my life as a prisoner in 
               this godforsaken dump. Now I'm going 
               out. I'll be back in a couple of 
               hours. Okay?

     The elevator doors close with Sebastian inside. Shit.

                    CARTER
               Shit.

     Carter runs down the corridor.

     INT OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

     Carter picks up the phone and dials.

     A beat then.

                    CARTER
               Yeah, it's Carter. We got a problem.

     INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

     The elevator doors open and Sebastian pushes past the 
     Marine Guard.

                    MARINE GUARD
               Hey, Doc. Haven't seen you for awhile? 

     Sebastian keeps his face turned away as he crosses to his 
     Porsche.

                    SEBASTIAN
               Yeah, well. You know how it in 
               sometimes.

                    MARINE GUARD
               You got that right, sir. I was 
               beginning to worry 'cause your car 
               hadn't moved.

                    SEBASTIAN
               Thanks, but everything's cool. 

     Sebastian starts his car. It chugs a few times before 
     turning over and speeding out of the warehouse.

     INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

     The door opens and Sebastian switches on the lights.

     He looks around his apartment and sighs. It's good to be 
     home.

     INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Sebastian enters the bedroom, clicking on the light. He 
     looks at the ceiling, "You Should Be Working", and 
     smiles.

     INT. LINDA'S APARTMENT BUILDING, PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

     Linda and Matt each rush to their respective cars.

                    MATT
               He could be anywhere. Hell he could be 
               right behind us.

                    LINDA
               I'll meet you at the lab. I'm gonna 
               swing by his place, just in case.

                    MATT
               See you there.

     Matt tries to give her a quick pack. Linda backs away.

                    LINDA
                     (quietly, looking around)
               I don't want him to see.

                    MATT
                     (looking around too)
               What a mess.

     They get in their cars.

     INT. SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Sebastian packs up a few personal belongings in an 
     overnight duffle. He crosses to his bookcase and pulls 
     out some books and throws them into the bag.

     But as he does, he notices a light come on in the window 
     across the courtyard. Sebastian turns off his bedroom 
     light and moves toward the window. He peers across the 
     courtyard into the Brunette's apartment.

     He watches the Brunette as she comes into the living room 
     from her front hallway. She drops her keys on the table 
     and begins unbuttoning her blouse as she crosses to the 
     window. Just as the blouse slips off her shoulder, she 
     pulls her blinds shut.

                    SEBASTIAN
               Shit.

     Frustrated, Sebastian steps away from the window and then 
     stops. Something has occurred to him.

                    SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Don't even think it...

     He looks down and notices his hand is trembling. His 
     breathing is a little heavy. A little nervous. He catches 
     a glimpse at himself in the mirror.

                    SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
                     (almost whispering)
               Once...just once.

     The Brunette's living room light switches off and the 
     bathroom light switches on. We see him fighting an 
     internal battle and we see him lose it. He grabs a hold 
     of his hand and peels the latex skin off.

     EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

     Linda drives Sebastian's apartment. She spots his black 
     Porsche in the parking lot. She pulls over to the curb, 
     jumps out of her car and heads into the building.

     INT. BRUNETTE'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Wearing just a robe, the brunette turns on her shower. 
     The doorbell rings. With a frustrated sigh, the brunette 
     rises.

     AT THE FRONT DOOR

     She peers through the peep hole. No one's there. But as 
     she turns she hears the doorbell again. She opens the 
     door, steps out into the hallway and looks around. Empty. 
     Puzzled she heads back inside her apartment.

     We follow her as she crosses to her bedroom, but a moment 
     later, the bedroom door closes on its own.

     We hear a SCREAM come from the other side. Then another. 
     Then a muffled struggled. And we...

                                             
     CUT TO:

     INT. HALLWAY, SEBASTIAN BUILDING - NIGHT

     Linda exits the elevator and heads down to Sebastian's 
     door. She knocks. Waits. No answer. She knocks again. 
     Waits.

     And then she tries the door. It's unlocked. She pushes 
     the door open.

                    LINDA
               Sebastian?

     INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Linda pushes through the living room, into the bedroom.

                    LINDA
               Sebastian?

     She notices that the bathroom light is on.

     BATHROOM

     On the floor she finds Sebastian's clothing and on the 
     vanity she sees his latex face and hands.

                    LINDA
               Oh shit.

     She scramble for the bedroom phone and quickly dials.

                    LINDA (cont'd)
               Yeah, Matt, it's me. He was here. No. 
               He's taken his make-up off. I don't 
               know...He must be outside somewhere.
               I don't know where he went. I'm coming 
               back to the lab. How? How'm I supposed 
               to do that? I CAN'T FUCKING SEE HIM! 
               We're going on alpha call.  I want 
               everyone at the lab now. We're gonna 
               need thermal visors and we may need 
               tranqs.

     As she hangs up the phone, and heads out. The CAMERA 
     doesn't follow, but instead pushes through the blinds and 
     out the window. As we cross the courtyard, we begin to 
     hear muffled cries of terror. We hold on the Brunette's 
     window as we...

                                             
     CUT TO:

     INT. BRUNETTE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     The bedroom door opens and we see the Brunette, nude and 
     curled up on the bed, sobbing. We follow the sounds of 
     heavy breathing to the front door of her apartment. The 
     door opens and we push out into the hallway. We can see 
     indentations of feet appear on the hallway carpet.

     INT. CORRIDOR BY SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT

     The elevator doors open and Linda steps inside. The doors 
     close shut behind her. A beat later we see the 
     indentations of footsteps come around the corner. We 
     follow the breathing and stumbling footfalls back into...

     INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     We push over to the bathroom sink. The faucet turns on 
     and the water starts running.

     We see the water cup under the faucet and splash against 
     Sebastian's face. His face appears briefly in the water. 
     Then the water slips away.

     For second it sounds like he's crying, but then we hear 
     something far worse. He's laughing. Nervous laughter.

     INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

     Matt hands out thermal goggles, while Frank loads and 
     passes out tranquilizer guns.

                    JANICE
               What are the tranqs for?

                    LINDA
               Use your imagination.

                    JANICE
               Are you saying he's dangerous?

                    MATT
               We're just saying we need to be 
               cautious.

                    LINDA
               The Metro stops running after midnight 
               and he's on foot, so he can't have 
               gotten too far.

                    CARTER
               Look, this isn't a monkey we're 
               talking about. It's Dr. Caine. Don't 
               you think you're over reacting?

                    LINDA
               This program is classified. If he's 
               out there it means someone might find 
               out about him. He could destroy the 
               whole program.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               Relax, Linda. No one's gonna find out. 

     They all turn around. At the door is Sebastian, back in 
     his latex outfit.

                    MATT
               Where the hell have you been?

                    SEBASTIAN
               I got a little stir crazy, so I went 
               to my apartment to pick up some stuff.

                    LINDA
               Bullshit! I went to your apartment and 
               I happen to know you did a helluva lot 
               more than pick some stuff up.

                    SEBASTIAN
               What are you talking about?

                    LINDA
               You, of all people How could you? 

     Caught dead to rights, Sebastian sinks into his chair. He 
     thinks she knows.

                    LINDA (cont'd)
               You put yourself and this project at 
               risk.

                    SEBASTIAN
               Just what did you see in my apartment?

                    LINDA
               I saw your face and your clothes.

                    MATT
               It was bad enough you left without an 
               escort, but to take off the...
                     (he motions to his face)
               out in public?

     Sebastian realizes that they don't know.

                    SEBASTIAN
               Don't make a mountain out of molehill. 
               I didn't let anyone see me.

                    LINDA
               That's not good enough. When you're 
               outside the lab there are a thousand 
               variables none of us can control. It's 
               just not safe for you to be out there.

                    SEBASTIAN
               Come on, Linda. You don't expect me to 
               be some kind of prisoner.

                    LINDA
               You volunteered for this, Sebastian. 
               You knew going in there could be 
               consequences.
                     (beat)
               For the security of this project, I'm 
               gonna have to ask you to confine 
               yourself to the compound.

                    SEBASTIAN
               I'm still Project Leader, Linda. It's 
               my decision to make.

                    LINDA
               You're right. It's your decision. But 
               if you leave the compound again, I'll 
               notify the oversight committee. Then 
               they can make the decision. You 
               understand?

                    SEBASTIAN
               Matt?

                    MATT
               Sorry, man. You'd do the same if it 
               were the other way around.

     A long beat. Sebastian slowly rises, acknowledges Linda 
     with a nod and leaves the room. Linda looks around at her 
     silent co-workers, the goggles and tranqs still on the 
     table.

                    LINDA
               Pack 'em up... Everyone go home.

                                        
     DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. LABORATORY - DAY

     The Lab is buzzing with the usual activity. Linda rolls 
     up Sebastian's sleeve, revealing nothing.

                    LINDA
               Hold still.

     She wraps a bungee cord around the nothing and pulls it 
     tight. She then sprays the inside of his elbow with dye.

                    SEBASTIAN
                     (contentious)
               How much blood do you think you've 
               taken so far?

     The surface of his skin sheens in the light as Linda 
     searches for a vein. She slaps his arm several times, 
     then plunges a hypodermic needle into his skin.

                    LINDA
               Not enough to worry about.

                    SEBASTIAN
               Every day... feels like you're sucking 
               me dry.

     Linda presses down on the hypodermic plunger, releasing a 
     dye into his bloodstream.

                    SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               It's funny. All these years I've known 
               you, I never pegged you for a 
               megalomanic.

                    LINDA
               What are you talking about?

                    SEBASTIAN
               The shoe being on the other foot. You 
               getting to run things.

                    LINDA
               I didn't ask for this, Caine. But when 
               a classified experiment disappears in 
               the middle of the night, someone's 
               gotta run the show.
                     (tries sympathy)
               Look, I know how hard this has been 
               for you.

     He knocks her arm away and pulls the hypo, out of his 
     arm.

                    SEBASTIAN
               Don't patronize me.
                     (beat)
               And for the record, you've got no idea 
               what it's like. I get up every morning 
               and you people stick needles in me. 
               You bombard me with radiation until I 
               vomit. And then at six it's over for 
               you. You get to go home. But Sebastian 
               is still here. Sebastian can't leave, 
               or else. That's the worst part, you 
               know. Here I have this ... this GIFT 
               and I can't even use it.

                    LINDA
               Now it's a gift?

                    SEBASTIAN
               You're goddamn right it's a gift. And 
               if you weren't so goddamned short 
               sighted, I'd be out there right now 
               trying to master it. 

     Sebastian looks around at the other scientists staring at 
     him. He tosses the hypo with the needle onto the 
     instrument tray and heads toward the door.

                    LINDA
               Where're you going?

                    SEBASTIAN
               Looks like I'm going nowhere.

                    MATT
               Come on, man. We've got a ton of tests 
               scheduled today.

                    SEBASTIAN
               Do them yourself.


     INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT

     Linda enters to find Sebastian reading the collected 
     works of T.S. Elliot.

                    LINDA
               Want to talk about it?

                    SEBASTIAN
               No.

     Linda looks over his shoulder.

                    LINDA
               "We are the hollow men, the stuffed 
               men, headpieces filled with straw."

                    SEBASTIAN
               Funny, huh? I've become a literal 
               metaphor.

     He puts the books down.

                    LINDA
               I don't want to fight you. I just want 
               what's best for the program.

                    SEBASTIAN
               I know. And you being right doesn't 
               make it any easier for me.

                    LINDA
               You can be scared. That's okay.

                    SEBASTIAN
               I'm not scared of being stuck this 
               way. With a little more make-up and 
               practice, I could...
                     (he motions to his face)
               ... pass. Y'know, get by in the world. 
               But the testing...

                    LINDA
               You're talking like you've given up. 
               It's only been a few months.

                    SEBASTIAN
               What if it's years? I don't know how 
               much more testing I can take.

     INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - LATER

     Sebastian paces back and forth, glancing at the camera.

     INT. LABORATORY - DAY

     Linda, Matt and Sebastian, in latex and scrubs, stare at 
     an electron microscope's video display. On the screen in 
     a sparse colony of blood calls but every second more and 
     more cells appear, filling the gap.

                    MATT
               60% reversion. 70% ... 75% ... 80% ...
               85 ...

     The others in the lab listen. They start to get excited. 
     Janice and Carter leave their research and come over to 
     watch the screen.

                    SEBASTIAN
               We've got it. We've got it.

                    MATT
               93% ... 95%... 95%

     They wait. Linda points to a blank patch on the screen.

                    LINDA
               That's all we need.

                    SEBASTIAN
               Come on, baby. Come on.

     But the blood cells nearest the blank patch twinkle out 
     existence, and then those around them also blink away 
     until after a beat, the screen is empty.

                    MATT
               Full quantum cascade at 95%.
                     (beat)
               I'm sorry.

                    SEBASTIAN
               You're sorry? You're fucking sorry? 

     Sebastian picks up a glass beaker and hurls it against 
     the wall. It shatters.

                    SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Six weeks of this shit and you're 
               sorry!

     He grabs more equipment and begins tossing it in a rage. 
     Carter and Janice grab him and restrain him. After 
     struggling against them a beat or two, Sebastian calms 
     down and pushes away from them and heads out the door.

                    JANICE
               I don't blame him.

                    LINDA
               I'll go talk to him.

                    MATT
               Leave him alone. He just needs to blow 
               off some steam.

     INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT

                                             
     CUT TO:

     Sebastian lies in his bed, staring at the security 
     camera. The camera stares back at him.

     As if from a dream, we hear the Brunette's muffled scream 
     and cries for help. As we push in on Sebastian's cold 
     eyes, we can barely make out her face thrashing back in 
     forth in panic and confusion.

     Sebastian suddenly rises.

     He crosses to the video camera and examines a small panel 
     on the underneath of the camera.

     He reaches into a box of twinkies and pulls out one of 
     the sponge cakes and begins munching. He hits the 
     intercom button on the phone.

                    FRANK (V.0.)
               Yeah?

                    SEBASTIAN
               I'm going to the lab.

                    FRANK (V.0.)
               Don't you sleep?

                    SEBASTIAN
               Waste of time. Da Vinci never slept.

     INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

     Frank eyes Sebastian in the monitor.

                    FRANK
               Okay. I'm here if you need me.

     He watches as Sebastian's heat signature moves toward the 
     door.

     INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

     In the dark deserted lab, Sebastian pulls together a 
     circuit board, a computer chip and some wiring. He seems  
     be assembling something.

     INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT

     Sebastian crosses underneath the camera... just out of 
     its range... reaches up and using a screwdriver, unscrews 
     the access panel. He scans the electronics and attaches 
     two alligator clips to wires on the circuit board.

     Trailing a long length of wire, Sebastian crosses back to 
     his bed and lies down. He holds a black project box with 
     a button on it. He lies perfectly still and press the 
     button.

     INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

     The video image of the Recovery Chamber flickers 
     slightly, before returning to normal.

     INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT

     Sebastian rises and begins to peel off his latex.

     INT. HALLWAY OF HABITATS - NIGHT

     Sebastian's POV - Various animals stir restlessly. A DOG, 
     visible, leaps against the Plexiglas, barking wildly. We 
     push further down the corridor.

     INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

     Again, Sebastian's POV as he pushes through the open door 
     of the observation room. We see Frank sorting through 
     various computer readouts, highlighting certain coding 
     sequences.

     We push in until we are looking over Frank's shoulder at 
     the video monitor. According to the video, Sebastian is 
     sleeping soundly in his room.

     INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT

     The rewired security camera stares down at the empty bed.

     INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

     Frank glances over at the video monitor. He can see 
     Sebastian's heat signature lying in the bed.

     Frank feels something on his neck. He flicks whatever it 
     is away with his hand and goes back to work.

     INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

     The elevator door opens. The Guard turns around. The 
     elevator is empty.

     INT. METRO STATION, WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT

     A Metro Subway train draws to a halt. With a cautionary 
     "BING BONG" its doors slide open. A handful of people 
     exit and enter. One man bumps shoulders. He turns round 
     to apologize, but there's no one there. The doors close 
     and the train pulls out of the station.

     EXT. DOWNTOWN D.C. - NIGHT

     A couple of pretty girls exit a bar and stumble to their 
     apartments.

     INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

     One of the girls enters her apartment. The door half 
     closes behind her and then reopens and closes again.

     INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - MORNING

     Frank's reading a book when Linda and Matt enter.

                    MATT
               How'd it go?

                    FRANK
               Quiet. He worked in the lab till about 
               10:30 and then went to sleep.

     INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - DAY

     Close on the security camera. The wires have been removed 
     and the access panel replaced.

     Sebastian whistles a cheerful tune as he finishes 
     applying his makeup. The door opens and Linda and Matt 
     enter.

                    SEBASTIAN
               Ah, my two favorite people. Good 
               morning.

                    LINDA
               Good morning.

                    MATT
               Why so cheery this morning?

                    SEBASTIAN
               You know some days you just wake up 
               feeling the world is full of 
               potential. Like your eyes have been 
               opened.

                    MATT
               I'm happy if I make it to my coffee 
               machine.

     Linda hands Sebastian a disk.

                    LINDA
               I restructured the third genome on 
               your radiated protein strand. Thought 
               you might want to take look.

                    SEBASTIAN
               Cook up a batch and let's see where we 
               go.

                    LINDA
               I thought you'd want to take a look at 
               it.

                    SEBASTIAN
               I trust you. Now if you'll excuse me, 
               I need to have my head examined.

     INT. STORAGE FREEZER - DAY

     Linda pulls bags of frozen plasma from the shelves in the 
     walk-in storage freezer.

                    LINDA
               I'm telling you, I know him. 
               Something's going on.

                    MATT
               Think he knows about us.

                    LINDA
               If he knew about us, he'd be angry and 
               that wasn't angry.

     INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

     Janice heads up one of the corridors when something on 
     the floor catches her eye. She bends down and takes a 
     look at it. Barely visible on the floor is a fragment of 
     a BAREFOOT FOOTPRINT.

     She runs her finger along the dried mud. It turns to 
     dust.

     INT. LABORATORY - DAY

     Sebastian holds his latex head on his lap, while EEG 
     leads hang suspended in mid-air, outlining his real head. 
     Carter analyzes the results.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               When you were a kid, you ever dream 
               about being invisible?

                    CARTER
               Sure... all the time.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               What did you imagine you'd do?

                    CARTER
               The usual.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               What's the usual?

                    CARTER
               Hanging out in the girl's locker room. 
               Kicking Jimmy Margiani's ass.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               Jimmy Margiani?

                    CARTER
               School asshole. Drove a red Trans Am. 
               Back then, I was the size of a small 
               planet and made a rather large target.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               Ever think up anything along the grand 
               scale?

                    CARTER
               Sure. World domination. Manipulating 
               stock markets, consolidating a 
               political power base. But those are 
               more recent fantasies.

     Carter pulls off the electrodes and Sebastian slides on 
     his latex facemask.

                    SEBASTIAN
               And what if it weren't fantasy? What 
               if you were out there in the world and 
               could do whatever you wanted with no 
               consequences whatsoever. How far would 
               go? I mean... if it were real?

                    CARTER
               I don't know, man. Out in the real 
               world... I mean, there's a 
               responsibility...

                    SEBASTIAN
               Let's say you saw a woman with amazing 
               tits. Would you brush against them?

                    CARTER
               Hell, I try and do that now.

                    SEBASTIAN
               Human nature. So if you could get away 
               with more, would you do more?

                    CARTER
               I read that in a survey at a major 
               university they asked college students 
               "Would you steal if you were 
               guaranteed to get away with it?" 82% 
               said yes.

                    SEBASTIAN
               Eighty two percent? Makes you wonder 
               if the world's ready for what we're 
               doing.

                    CARTER
               So, Doc what did you do?

                    SEBASTIAN
               What do you mean?

                    CARTER
               When you were out.

                    SEBASTIAN
               I just walked around. Y'know.

                    CARTER
               Aw, you just walked around? Come on. 
               There's more, right?

                    SEBASTIAN
               Like what?

                    CARTER
               Man, I'd be walking up to people 
               saying shit like "This is God, go,get 
               a haircut." Or hanging out in the 
               changing room at Victoria's Secret.

                    SEBASTIAN
               Kind of sophomoric, don't you think. 
               Besides, it was late and I wasn't out 
               that long.

                    CARTER
               Well, did you see anybody?

                    SEBASTIAN
               There was this one girl.

                    CARTER
               Yeah? And did you mess with her? 

                    SEBASTIAN
               Naw...

     Sebastian gives Carter a sly grin.

                    SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Well maybe a little.
                     (beat)
               I tell you though, a man could get 
               used to it.

     INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

     Alone, Linda packs up her stuff for the evening.

     Slowly we push in on her and hear quiet breathing. We 
     realize we are in...

     SEBASTIAN'S POV

     Then ...

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               Goodnight.

     Linda-jumps.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
               Sorry, didn't mean to frighten you.

                    LINDA
               It's fine. I just didn't know you were 
               there. Goodnight.

     As she leaves the Lab, he follows her down the hallway.

     EXT. LINDA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

     Linda passes through the revolving doors of her apartment 
     building. A few beats later, as if caught by a gust of 
     wind, the revolving door slowly turns on its own.

     INT. APARTMENT'S HALLWAY - NIGHT

     Linda slips into her apartment and the door closes behind 
     her. A moment later we see the doorknob turn back and 
     forth. It's locked.

     EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

     On a fire escape, we see the ladder shake and descend to 
     the ground. The metal rattles back and forth as if 
     something were climbing it.

     We slowly crane up the fire escape and hold on a window. 
     Through the wispy curtains and dirty glass we can see 
     Linda enter the room. The panel of glass fogs from 
     Sebastian's breath. The fog wipes away, seemingly by 
     itself.

     But then through the window we see Matt walk into the 
     living room and put his arms around Linda's waist. We 
     hear a shocked intake of air.

     He kisses her neck and then slowly unzips her dress. Her 
     dress falls to the floor. Matt takes off his sport coat 
     and drapes it over a chair, while Linda unfastens the 
     buttons of his shirt. They're laughing now, exchanging 
     kisses.

     Matt reaches behind Linda and unhooks her bra. He kisses 
     his way down her neck to her breasts. Linda pulls him to 
     her.

     Suddenly the window shatters. Startled, both Matt and 
     Linda jump back covering themselves.

     We hear Sebastian's footsteps as he retreats down the 
     fire escape.

     A moment later Matt reaches the window and peers out. He 
     sees the fire escape ladder slowly rise back up down 
     below.

                    LINDA
               What was it?

                    MATT
               I don't know. I don't see anything. 

     Matt picks up a piece of glass and examines it.

                    MATT (cont'd)
               It's like something hit it.

     Linda picks up the phone and dials.

     INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

     Carter picks up the phone.

                    CARTER
               Hello?

     Carter looks at the security monitor of the recovery 
     room. Sebastian's heat signature lies still on the bed.

                    CARTER (cont'd)
               No. No. He's here No, I'm staring at 
               him. He's right there in his room.

     INT. LINDA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Linda breathes a sigh of relief.

                    LINDA
               Thanks. No, just checking. 'Kay, bye.
                     (hangs up phone)
               Phew.

     Matt pulls her into him.

                    MATT
               Relax... it's nothing. Where were we?

     INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT

     BARKING can be heard in the background. That horrible 
     repetitive barking that grates the soul like Chinese 
     water torture.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               Be quiet!

     A photograph of Linda drifts through the air and settles 
     atop a flaming candle. It ignites into fire, twisting and 
     turning in mid-air, then falling on the floor as ash. A 
     beat later water runs from the sink faucet. It forms in 
     the shape of hands and splashes against his face, 
     dripping away.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
               And the cyclops screamed out, "Who is 
               it who blinds me?" and Odysseus 
               replied "Nobody is my name". And the 
               Cyclops raged to his friends "Nobody 
               is killing me. Nobody".

     The barking continues. A moment later the chamber door 
     slides open. We push down the...

     HALLWAY OF THE HABITATS

     ... until we are face-to-face with the unhappy barking 
     dog.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               Shhhh. It's Nobody-It's nothing.

     The Plexiglas door to the doggie's cage swings open and 
     some invisible force grabs little doggie around the neck. 
     The force squeezes its little fur ball throat until the 
     barking stops.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
               Nobody's gonna hurt you. 

     The force keeps squeezing until the little doggie goes 
     limp. Then the dog smashes against the Plexiglas over and 
     over until blood spills out its mouth. The Plexiglas door 
     swings closed again and moments later the door to 
     Sebastian's cubicle closes as well. The water runs in 
     Sebastian's sink washing the blood away from his now half 
     visible hands.

                                        
     DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. HABITAT'S CORRIDOR - NEXT MORNING

     Sarah sees the dead dog lying prone on its bedding. She 
     eyes it curiously and opens the cage door.

     INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - LATER

     Sarah stares at the empty chamber.

                    SARAH
               You awake?

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               I am now.

     The sheets raise and drape off of him.

                    SARAH
               Notice anything unusual last night. 

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               No. Why?

                    SARAH
               Franklin Three. He's dead.

     Sebastian pulls a sheet around him. He moves across the 
     dimly lit room like a ghost.

                    SEBASTIAN
               What of?

                    SARAH
               His neck was broken and his windpipe 
               collapsed.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               How'd that happen?

                    SARAH
               I thought maybe you could tell me.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               Sarah... You saying I had something to 
               do with it?

                    SARAH
               He was alive last night when I left 
               and he was dead this morning. And you 
               were the only one down here.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               I was in my room all night.

     INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

     Sarah sits with Carter as they run through the security 
     video tape. Matt and Linda look over their shoulder.

                    CARTER
               That's all twelve hours.

                    LINDA
               He never left the room.

                    SARAH
               A windpipe doesn't just suddenly 
               collapse. Someone or something killed 
               it.

                    MATT
               You saw the tape. The man was in his 
               chamber.

                    SARAH
               Then we have a problem, because I the 
               cage was locked from the outside. That 
               means it was opened, the dog was 
               killed and the cage was closed and 
               locked again. Only a human could do 
               that.

                    CARTER
               Well, it wasn't me.

                    MATT
               And it wasn't him.

                    LINDA
               Are we sure?

     INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT

     Linda passes Sebastian's chamber. Sebastian's in latex.

                    SEBASTIAN
               Any big plans for tonight?

                    LINDA
               Quiet night at home. Maybe a book.

                    SEBASTIAN
               Really? Whatever happened to that guy 
               your were seeing?

                    LINDA
               He's still in the picture. Why?

                    SEBASTIAN
               Being locked down here, I'm forced to 
               live vicariously. Someday you'll have 
               to tell me what he's like.

                    LINDA
               Maybe someday I will. See you in the 
               morning.

                    SEBASTIAN
               Au domain.

     Sebastian watches Linda walk away. He glances at the 
     camera and starts to peel off his face.

     INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

     The elevator door opens. It's empty.

     SEBASTIAN'S POV - as we push past the guard and down onto 
     the street.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     Empty street. We hear whistling. Splashes of water splat 
     out from shallow puddles,,as Sebastian walks through 
     them.

     SEBASTIAN'S POV - A car approaches. As it drives by we 
     see Matt and Linda inside, heading back to the warehouse.

     The footsteps stop.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               Hmmm.

     We see the footsteps start to head back toward the 
     warehouse.

     INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

     Linda and Matt exit their car and cross toward the 
     elevator.

                    LINDA
                     (to Marine Guard)
               Forgot something.

     INT. STREET IN FRONT OF WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

     As we watch the footsteps head back through the puddles 
     toward the warehouse, we see Frank pass us in his car.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               What the hell?

     He breaks into a run. Feet splash water and he races back 
     toward the warehouse.

     INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

     Empty. The elevator door opens and we push out into the 
     hallway. Sebastian's POV

     INT. HALLWAY OF HABITATS - NIGHT

     We follow Sebastian down the hallway to his cubicle. But 
     as he rounds the corner, he quickly ducks back. The 
     entire research team is in his cubicle. Sebastian slowly 
     approaches and watches as Frank takes down his video 
     board.

                    FRANK
               Pretty clever really. All it does is 
               recycle the signal. He flips this 
               switch, it takes a snapshot and that's 
               all we see.

                    LINDA
               Asshole.

                    JANICE
               And you think he's violent?

                    SARAH
               He killed a dog with his bare hands.

                    FRANK
               Dogs aren't people. Are we in any 
               danger?

     Linda doesn't know.

                    LINDA
               Either way, we aren't equipped to 
               handle this. We have to inform the 
               committee.

     Everybody murmurs in agreement.

                    JANICE
               What if he doesn't come back?

                    LINDA
               They'll go after him.
                     (beat)
               Who has tonight's shift?

                    JANICE
               I do.

                    LINDA
               Pretend nothing's wrong. Everyone just 
               do what you're doing so he doesn't 
               become suspicious. Okay? Matt and I'll 
               go tell Doctor Kramer and we'll lot 
               the committee deal with it. 

     Sebastian's POV - He backs away and races down the hall.

     EXT. DR. KRAMER'S HOUSE - POTOMAC MD - NIGHT

     The stately stone house sits on a finely manicured lawn 
     in one of the nicest neighborhoods in town. Linda's car 
     is parked on the curb in front.

     We break from a typical establishing shot and as the 
     CAMERA tracks closer to the house, we realize that we are

     SEBASTIAN'S POV

     We hear breathing and footsteps as we push through some 
     bushes and head toward a bay window which looks into the 
     Kramer living room.

     Through the glass we see LINDA and MATT seated across 
     from DR. KRAMER. We can't hear what they're saying but it 
     certainly looks serious. Kramer puffs on a pipe and 
     strokes his beard, shaking his head.

     Kramer rises and shakes hands with Linda and Matt, and 
     the three of them head toward the front door.

     We move away from the window and track toward the front 
     door. As the door opens we begin to hear the tail end of 
     the conversation.

                    KRAMER
               I'll call General Caster right now and 
               convene the oversight committee 
               tomorrow.

                    LINDA
               Thank you, sir.

                    MATT
               What do we do in the meantime?

                    KRAMER
               Just sit tight and wait for my call. 

     Matt and Linda head down to her car. Kramer heads back 
     inside.

     INT. KRAMER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Kramer heads back into the living room. His wife appears 
     a the upstairs railing.

                    MRS. KRAMER
               What was that about?

                    KRAMER
               Just a little trouble at work.

                    MRS. KRAMER
               You coming up?

                    KRAMER
               In a minute. I have to make a few 
               calls.

     Mrs. Kramer retreats back to her bedroom as Dr. Kramer 
     crosses over to the telephone. He picks up the receiver 
     and starts dialing. In the middle of dialing, the phone 
     goes dead. He clicks the hookswitch up and down trying to 
     get a dial tone. Nothing. He checks the connections on 
     the phone and then follows the wiring to the wall. The 
     line's plugged in. Weird. He hears a door creak open in 
     the kitchen.

                    KRAMER (cont'd)
               Hello? Hello?

     Kramer crosses to the darkened kitchen. The kitchen door 
     leading to the backyard is open. Puzzled, he crosses to 
     it. A wind stirs across the pool and backyard, swirling 
     dead leaves in small twists of wind. The windchime rings 
     lightly. Kramer steps out.

     EXT. POOL/PATIO, BACKYARD - NIGHT

     In the dim spillover light from house, Kramer crosses to 
     the telephone- box against the back of the house. It Is 
     open and several of the wires have been pulled. He looks 
     around, spooked and puffs out a cloud of smoke from his 
     pipe. For the briefest of instants, Sebastian's face is 
     visible in the smoke. Kramer jumps back in surprise and 
     the pipe drops from his mouth. He gives a small sharp 
     cry, but deep indentations appear across his mouth and 
     his cries are stifled. In the darkness, we can make out 
     his form writhing as if possessed. The struggle continues 
     a beat until Kramer manages to break free.

                    KRAMER
               Help! HELP! MARTHA! HELP!

     As Kramer runs, he looks behind him. But no one's there. 
     WHAM! Something slams into Kramer and he tumbles, rolling 
     into the pool. But as he hits water there's not just one 
     splash, but TWO. In the water next to him is human shaped 
     AIR-POCKET. It's Sebastian displacing the water. And 
     because of the water displacement, we can clearly see two 
     arms pushing Kramer beneath the water's surface. 

     MARTHA KRAMER opens the bedroom window and looks down at 
     the pool. All she can see is her husband drowning... his 
     flailing limbs kicking up a massive air bubble around 
     him. She races from the window. Kramer kicks and flails 
     for a few moments and then his limbs stop moving. A 
     moment later he floats to surface, face down. The AIR 
     POCKET bobs over to the pool ladder, and rising from the 
     pool, we see Sebastian's body outlined in sheets of 
     water. The shape melts away in a cascading waterfall 
     until all we can see of Sebastian are the hundreds of 
     tiny droplets still clinging to his body, caught in the 
     light like twinkling bulbs on a Christmas tree. The shape 
     disappears into the darkness. A moment later Martha 
     emerges from the house and sees her husband floating face 
     down in the pool. She screams.

     INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - DAY

     Linda passes by Sebastian's chamber.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               What? No good morning for me? Don't 
               you like me anymore?

                    LINDA
               Oh, sorry. I...I'm in a hurry.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               That's okay. It's going to be busy 
               day.

     INT. LINDA'S OFFICE - DAY

     Matt sits across from her, twirling a pen in his hand. 
     They both stare at the phone.

                    LINDA
               When did he say held call?

                    MATT
               He's probably meeting with the 
               committee trying to figure out what to 
               do.

                    LINDA
               I'm gonna call him.

     Linda picks up the phone and dials.

                    LINDA (cont'd)
               Yes, Dr. Kramer please. Excuse me?
                     (inhales sharply - surprised)
               When? I'm so sorry.

     Linda blanches as she hangs up the phone.

                    MATT
               What?

                    LINDA
               He's dead. Drowned in his pool last 
               night.

     Linda picks up the phone again and dials.

                    LINDA (cont'd)
               Yes, General Thompson please. Thank 
               you. 

     As she waits the phone line clicks dead.

                    LINDA (cont'd)
               Hello? Hello?

     She clicks on the hookswitch.

                    MATT
               Let me see that.

     He tries it too. Same result.

                    MATT (cont'd)
               Intercom's working, but there doesn't 
               seem to be an outside line.

     INT. CORRIDOR/ELEVATOR

     They waste no time getting to the elevator. Linda and 
     Matt step in.

                    LINDA
               I'll be right back with help.

     Linda taps in his floor code.

     Linda taps the keypad again.

     Matt hits buttons on the keypad.

                    LINDA
               Tell me this isn't happening.

     INT. LABORATORY - DAY

     Frank, Sarah, Carter and Janice man various work stations 
     in the lab. Linda and Matt enter.

                    LINDA
               We've got a problem.

     INT. COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT

     Frank's fingers fly over the keyboard.

                    MATT
               How long before anybody starts looking 
               for us?

                    LINDA
               There's no set check in procedure. It 
               could be weeks.

     A graphic of the elevator system pops up on the screen. 
     Frank highlights the security terminal. Frank hits a few 
     more keys. The screen reduces to a series of numbers.

                    LINDA (cont'd)
               You think you can got in?

     Frank rewrites a few of the numbers.

                    FRANK
               Already in. It was only a second level 
               encryption.

     The Security System specifications pops up.

                    JANICE
               Some security system.

                    FRANK
               Oh the system is fine. It's just I'm 
               just extraordinary.

     Frank types a few more keys, and his eyes widen.

                    FRANK (cont'd)
               But apparently someone is more 
               extraordinary than me.

                    MATT
               What is it?

                    FRANK
               There's nothing wrong with the system. 
               Our codes have been removed.

                    MATT
               Removed? By who?

                    FRANK
               Here's a clue. Only one code remains. 

                    LINDA
               Whose?

                    FRANK
               Dr. Sebastian Caine.

     INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER

     The team approaches Sebastian's chamber. Carter pulls on 
     the pair of thermal goggles dangling from his neck up.

     THERMAL POV - The chamber is empty.

                    CARTER
               He's not in there.

     Linda enters the chamber. She notes that Sebastian's face 
     and makeup are on the sink vanity. Linda crosses to the 
     phone and hits the "PAGE BUTTON"

                    LINDA
               Okay, Sebastian. Fun's over. Tell us 
               where you are.

     She waits. Then...

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               I'm sorry. But I can't lot you turn me 
               in.

                    LINDA
               Sebastian... where are you?

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (INTERCOM)
               You have no idea what it's like. The 
               power of it. The freedom. I can't let 
               that go.

                    LINDA
               C'mon Sebastian. You're scaring me. 
               Tell me where you are and we can talk 
               about it.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (INTERCOM)
               There's nothing to talk about. See ... 
               I've done things that can't be undone. 

     A long beep as the intercom clicks off.

                    LINDA
               Sebastian! Sebastian!
                     (beat)
               I want search parties. Thermal goggles 
               and tranquilizers.

     INT. CORRIDOR

     Linda and Matt, wearing thermal goggles and clutching 
     tranquilizer pistols, walk down the hallway, scanning 
     back and forth.

     INT. SEBASTIAN'S OFFICE

     Janice enters the office.

                    JANICE
               Dr. Caine? Are you in here? Dr. Caine? 

     Suddenly, Janice jerks back.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               I'm here.

     INT. HABITAT'S CORRIDOR

     Sarah scans all the habitats with a thermal scanner. 
     Listening intently.

     INT. SEBASTIAN'S OFFICE

     Janice struggles with her unseen assailant, slamming into 
     walls and knocking into filing cabinets.

     INT. LABORATORY

     Frank and Carter search the lab with their thermal 
     scopes.

                    FRANK
               Doctor Caine?

     INT. SEBASTIAN'S OFFICE

     Linda and Matt knock.

                    LINDA
               Sebastian?

     No response. They push through the door. The room seems 
     deserted. Signs of a struggle. File cabinets opened, 
     drawers tossed.

                    MATT
               This is bad.

     THERMAL POV - Linda surveys the room, spotting a slight 
     heat signature peeking from the corner.

                    LINDA
               There's something over there.

     Linda moves toward it. Whatever it is its hidden from 
     Matt's POV by the supply cabinet. As Linda gets close she 
     pulls of f her thermal goggles to see...

     JANICE -

     Her face blue, eyes bulging. An I.V. cord wrapped around 
     his neck. Linda jumps back.

                    LINDA (cont'd)
               Jesus. Oh my god.

     Matt rushes over. Sees the lifeless corpse.

                    MATT
               What happened?

     Linda lowers the body to the floor.

                    LINDA
               She was strangled. Multiple blows to 
               her head.

     Linda begins a medical check of the rest of the body. 
     Matt stoops down and examines Janice's face.

                    LINDA (cont'd)
               We got a big problem here.

     A lamp tumbles from the desk and smashes to the floor. 
     Both Linda and Matt jump. Linda frantically dons the 
     thermal visor and scopes the room again. Nothing. Matt 
     notices the lamp cord beneath Linda's leg. Points it out 
     to her. She sighs with relief... she pulled the lamp off 
     the table.

                    LINDA (cont'd)
               Get everybody to the conference room. 
               Now!

     Matt picks up the phone. Clicks the hookswitch. Clicks 
     the hookswitch again.

                    MATT
               Intercom... the phone lines. They're 
               dead.

                    LINDA
               Gimme that.

     She checks the phone, punches some numbers. Nothing.

                    LINDA (cont'd)
               It was just working.

                    MATT
               What the fuck is going on here?

     INT. CORRIDOR

     Matt and Linda head toward the lab.

     Linda suddenly stops.

                    MATT
               What?

                    LINDA
               Shhh.

     Linda takes a few cautious steps. Senses something.

                    LINDA (cont'd)
               Give me the visor.

     Matt, suddenly concerned, hands her the visor. 

     THERMAL POV - Linda checks out the corridor. Empty. Linda 
     takes Matt's hand.

                    LINDA (cont'd)
               C'mon.

     They move quickly up the corridor. See Frank, Sarah and 
     Carter.

                    FRANK
               Did you find him?

                    LINDA
               Janice is dead.

     INT. CONFERENCE ROOM

     Linda scans the room with her thermal scope.

                    LINDA
               It's clear.

     Matt, Frank, Janice and Sarah step in, locking the door 
     behind them.

                    SARAH
               The man has checked out of reality.

                    FRANK
               What happened? I don't understand.

                    CARTER
               Isn't it obvious? Right now, we're the 
               only ones who knows he exists. If he 
               gets rid of us, no one knows and he 
               becomes the most powerful man on 
               earth.

                    FRANK
               But he's not a killer.

     They all look at Linda.

                    LINDA
               He wasn't. He is now.

                    MATT
               Can you fix the elevator? Restore our 
               codes?

                    FRANK
               It'd take hours to crack the 
               encryptions.

                    MATT
               Right now that sounds like good news.

                    CARTER
               So what do we do until then. Sit 
               around waiting for him to kill us off? 

     Everyone looks around for some leadership. Finally.

                    LINDA
               No. We find him, before he finds us.

     INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

     The group moves quickly, passing under an air vent. As 
     they round the corner the vent slowly swings down and an 
     air disturbance drops to the ground.

     INT. OBSERVATION ROOM

     As they enter...

                    CARTER
               You sure this'll work.

     Linda sits down at a computer terminal, activates it.

                    LINDA
               We designed it to help find the rats 
               we kept dropping in year one. They 
               were too small for thermal scans.

     A map of the compound appears on the screen.

                    MATT
               Systems hot. Activating motion 
               detectors.

     Matt toggles a switch. Linda stares at a map of the 
     compound. Blips appear on the display... in the 
     observation room... in the Habitat Area and in one of the 
     corridors.

                    LINDA
               I've got movement in Corridor Six.

                    MATT
               That's him.

     INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

     A shadow edges down the tunnel. It settles for a moment, 
     disappearing completely, then is back on the move. At the 
     tunnel's edges, motion detectors light up as the thing 
     passes by.

     INT. OBSERVATION ROOM

     Carter checks his Tranq pistol & Matt rummages through a 
     locker.

                    MATT
               Got 'em.

     Matt pulls out a pair of walkie-talkies. He tosses one to 
     Linda.

                    LINDA
                     (into walkie)
               Check. Check.

     Her voice echoes from the other unit.

                    LINDA (cont'd)
               Be careful.

                    MATT
               Just watch our backs. Hey Carter, 
               ready?

                    CARTER
               Let's do it.

     Matt and Carter exit. Linda locks the door behind them.

     INT. TUNNEL

     Matt and Carter trot toward corridor six.

     INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

     Linda huddles over the display, tracking the two.

                    LINDA
                     (into Walkie)
               Take a right at the next accessway. 
               He's working his way back to the 
               offices.

     We see Matt and Carter on one of the working video 
     screens as they push down the tunnel.

     INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

     Matt and Carter move cautiously, listening for any sound.

                    MATT
                     (Walkie - sotto)
               If we split up, can we trap him on 
               corridor eight?

                    LINDA (V.0.)
               If he keeps heading in that direction. 

     Matt nods to Carter. The pair splits, heading down 
     separate accessways.

                    MATT
               Going Thermal.

     Matt pulls the visor down over his eyes.

     INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

     Linda watches the two separate and come around Sebastian 
     in a pincer move.

     Suddenly, the blip that was Sebastian disappears. Linda 
     grabs the walkie.

                    LINDA
               I lost him. Matt, I lost him.

     INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

     Matt makes his way forward.

                    MATT
               He probably just stopped moving.

     But Matt becomes more cautious with his footsteps. Slowly 
     ... approaching a corner...

     He rounds the corner and sees a heat signature at the far 
     end of the corridor. He levels his pistol, ready to fire.

                    CARTER
               It's me.

     Matt pulls off his goggles.

                    MATT
               Do you have anything?

                    CARTER
               Nothing.

                    MATT
               How did he get by us?

                    CARTER
               He couldn't.

                    MATT
               Sebastian! We're here to help. 
               Sebastian.

     No response. They both don their visors and move forward 
     slightly. Carter holds up his hand.

                    CARTER
               There. Behind those pipes. He's not 
               moving.

     Carter points. Matt checks his thermal. A red heat 
     signature clings to the wall.

                    CARTER (cont'd)
               Doctor Caine?
                     (beat)
               Can you hear me?

     No response.

                    MATT
                     (into walkie)
               We see him. But he's not responding. 
               The heat signature doesn't move.

     Matt looks through his visor and holds the tranquilizer 
     gun at the ready. He looks for a clear shot. The heat 
     signature huddles behind pipes.

                    MATT
               C'mon... C'mon...

     The two slowly move closer. Matt finally has a clear 
     shot. He signals Carter. Carter levels his pistol too.

                    CARTER
               Covered.

     Matt fires the dart at the heat signature. It bounces off 
     the wall ... Nothing there. 

                    MATT
               What the...

     He crosses to the heat signature.

                    MATT (cont'd)
               Just a vent. Just a goddamn vent

                    LINDA (V.0.)
               He was there.

                    MATT
               Looks like... looks like we're pumping 
               out heat...

     Suddenly behind him... CARTER JERKS THREE FEET in the 
     air, kicking wildly. SUSPENDED IN MID-AIR BY HIS NECK. He 
     gasps for air.

                    LINDA (V.0.)
               I got movement again! He's right on 
               top of you!

                    MATT
               No fucking shit!

     Matt opens fire with the tranquilize, shooting at the 
     ceiling until he spends his dart rounds.

                    MATT (cont'd)
               Sebastian? Goddamnit! Let him go.

                    CARTER
                     (choking)
               H...Help... MMmmphg

     Carter suffocates. He passes out. With a sudden crack, 
     he's thrown against the side wall. A large cut opens up 
     across his head and his body goes limp.

                    MATT
                     (into walkie)
               Where is he? Where the fuck is he?!?

     INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

     Linda huddles over the display.

                    LINDA
               Right on top of you.

     INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

     Matt scrambles away. Running. Pipes burst and swing down 
     from the ceiling. Steam billows forth. Something moves 
     through the cloud of steam.

     Around the corner, Matt shoves more darts into his 
     tranquilizer.

                    LINDA (V.0.)
               What's going on? Are you okay?

                    MATT
               Carter's down. Hurt bad. Bleeding from 
               a head wound.

     INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Linda watches the screen. Two blips, one traveling 
     quickly.

                    LINDA
               Matt, he's coming toward you.

     INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

     Matt takes a few steps back.

                    MATT
               Shit.

                    LINDA
               Got outta there.

     Matt breaks into a run.

     INT. OBSERVATION ROOM

     Linda watches one dot chasing the other, down several 
     corridors.

                    LINDA
               He's close!

     INT. TUNNEL

     Matt running, checking over his shoulder. Sounds of 
     footsteps behind him, but up ahead the heavy metal blast 
     doors begin to close.

                    MATT
               Goddamnit. The doors are closing. He's 
               shutting me in.

     Matt rushes the doors as they slide shut. He doesn't make 
     it in time. The doors close with a resounding clang. Matt 
     turns and pulls on his thermals.

                    MATT (cont'd)
               Where is he?

     INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Linda huddled over the screen. Tense.

                    LINDA
               He's coming right at you! 

     Then checks the Thermal goggles. Several heat signature 
     dot the tunnel.

                    MATT
               Where?

                    LINDA
               Twenty, maybe thirty feet.

                    MATT
               Goddamnit, I got thermals all over the 
               place. Eight, maybe ten of them. Must 
               be ghosts.

     INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Linda gets a sense of forboding. She looks around the 
     room. Sees a heating vent in the corner.

     Beat.

     She grabs the walkie.

                    LINDA
               Those signatures ... they're coming 
               from the heating vents. 

     Through the goggles, Matt sees the tunnel turning red.

                    MATT
               I'm starting to lose resolution on my 
               thermals.

                    LINDA
               Get out of there!

     INT. OBSERVATION ROOM

                    FRANK
               If the room temperature is the same as 
               his body temperature, thermal 
               visors'll be no good.

     Linda grabs a Tranq gun and heads for the door. 

                    LINDA
               I'm going!

                    FRANK
               Linda...it's not safe.

                    LINDA
               That's why I'm going.
                     (to Frank and Sarah)
               Corridor eight is clear. Get Carter to 
               the lab. We'll meet you there.

                    FRANK
               But...

                    LINDA
               Do it.

     INT. CORRIDOR

     Matt turns to face the corridor. It's turning red. Matt 
     sees some movement in the thermal cloud. Opens fire. But 
     the thermal signature disappears into the heat. Matt 
     can't distinguish anything through his goggles anymore. 
     He pulls them off and holds him gun in front of him 
     sweeping the hallway.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               Marco...Polo... Marco... Polo...

     His voice keeps shifting. Matt fires.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
               Not even close.

     Matt sweeps his front leg back and forth, like a blind 
     man using a cane. But his foot isn't hitting anything. He 
     sees a FIRE EXTINGUISHER mounted on the wall. He rushes 
     it, turns it on the hallway and sprays. And SOMETHING 
     LUNGES through the foam. GRABS HIM, sending him tumbling 
     down the tunnel. Matt is thrown against the wall. Blood 
     coming from his brow. He scrambles away, spraying more 
     foam. Sees a shape in the mist, raises his pistol and 
     FIRES. The shape leaps away. The DART FLIES. Doesn't hit. 
     Matt scrambles back into a corner. His pistol is empty.

                    SEBASTIAN
               So... just out of curiosity, how long 
               has my best friend been fucking my ex-
               girlfriend.

                    MATT
               Sebastian. Get a hold of yourself. You 
               aren't thinking rationally.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               She's a pretty sweet fuck, isn't she?

                    MATT
               Calm down, Sebastian... we can talk 
               this through. It's not too late.

     The Shape parts the low hanging mist, the fine powder 
     swirling in clouds behind it. Coming toward him.

                    MATT (CONT'D)
               C'mon Sebastian. Don't do this. I'm 
               your friend.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               I'm sorry, but I just feel that our 
               friendship is holding me back. I'm 
               sure you understand. 

     THE DOOR OPENS. Linda reaches through, grabs Matt. She 
     pulls him to his feet and through the door.

     INT. TUNNEL

     Frank and Sarah, holding their Tranq pistols, fly down 
     the corridor.

                    SARAH
               This way.

     They shear off the main corridor into the side corridor. 
     Carter lies crumpled up ahead. Sarah slides to his side. 
     Carter's head rests in a pool of blood. She checks his 
     pulse while Frank takes a protective position.

                    SARAH (cont'd)
               Pulse is weak. Breathing... shallow.

                    FRANK
               He'll be okay.

                    SARAH
               It's pretty severe. We have to get him 
               to the lab.

                    FRANK
               He's got to be okay.

     Frank stands frozen.

                    SARAH
               For godsakes, help me.

     Frank snaps to. Grabs an arm. The pair hoist Carter up 
     and carry him down the hallway.

     INT. OBSERVATION ROOM

     Linda pulls a handle and doors slide shut behind them.

                    MATT
               He was going to kill me.

     Linda pulls him close.

                    LINDA
               I know. He's gone.

                    MATT
               We've got to got out of here.

     Linda checks the screen -- see Sarah, Frank and Carter 
     headed toward the Laboratory.

                    MATT (cont'd)
               Where is he? Goddamnit, where is he? 

     Isolated in the Hallway of Habitats is a single blip.

                    LINDA
               Habitats.

                    MATT
               Oh god. That's right between us and 
               the lab.

     INT. LABORATORY

     Frank and Sarah lift Carter onto a medical table.

                    SARAH
               His pulse is faint.

     Sarah grabs a sheet from the counter top. Folds it and 
     presses it against the head wound.

                    SARAH (cont'd)
               He's lost a lot of blood. Here. Hold 
               this.

     She guides Frank's hands to the wound.

                    SARAH (cont'd)
               Keep applying pressure.

     Sarah pulls out a saline solution I.V. bag and slap it on 
     the rack. She fumbles with the needle as she tries to 
     find a vein.

                    SARAH (cont'd)
               Don't move your hand until I got back. 

     Sarah heads to the door.

                    FRANK
               Where are you going?

                    SARAH
               This'll hold him but he needs blood.

                    FRANK
               But...

                    SARAH
               Supply is right down the hall. I'll be 
               two seconds.

                    FRANK
               Sarah, wait for the others

                    SARAH
               If I wait, he'll die. Keep pressure on 
               the wound.

     INT. CORRIDOR

     Sarah exits the lab. Checks the corridor. Down at the end 
     of the cramped tunnel is the supply room.

     She swallows her fear and heads toward it, all the while 
     glancing side-to-side and behind her.

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM

     Spooked, Sarah bursts into the room. She goes to the 
     supply fridge/freezer, pulls open the door, and sorts 
     through blood bags.

     INT. TUNNEL

     Matt and Linda push along the corridor; Matt spraying 
     with the fire extinguisher in short controlled bursts, 
     Linda clutching her tranquilizer like a commando.

     A noise behind them. Footsteps.

     Matt turns to blast with the extinguisher. The white 
     chemical dust sprays out, outlining a shape in the 
     tunnel. But it isn't a human shape.

     Matt's uniform shreds. Something with fierce sharp claws 
     fells him. Tearing into his flesh. We see a angry, hungry 
     face... jabbing for a moment through the lingering fog.

                    MATT
               Ahh!  Shit!

     Linda tries to get a clear shot off through the smoke. 
     Matt trips and goes sprawling. Something yelps. A howl. 
     Linda shoots. Her dart jabs into something which 
     collapses to the ground. A moment of calm. As the dusty 
     chemical foam settles, the outline of a great ape 
     appears, still twitching.

                    MATT (cont'd)
               Karl Three. Nice shot.

                    LINDA
               He's let the animals out. It wasn't 
               him we were tracking.

     Linda leans against the wall, still clutching her tranq 
     gun at the ready. The heat is getting to bar. Bar scrubs 
     are soaked, her hair's a mess. She wipes the sweat from 
     her brow.

                    LINDA (cont'd)
               You okay?

                    MATT
               It won't kill me unless it gets 
               infected. You?

                    LINDA
               Me .... Don't ask about me. If he 
               freed all the animals, we could have 
               dozens running around the lab.

                    MATT
               So he could be anywhere right now.

     Matt sprays the whole tunnel, putting down a gentle cloud 
     mist. Nothing else appears.

                    MATT (cont'd)
               What do we do?

                    LINDA
               Get to the lab, lock the goddamn doors 
               and pray to God Frank can reprogram 
               the elevator.

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM

     Sarah finishes collecting blood bags and shuts the door 
     to the fridge/freezer.

     The DOOR SLAMS behind her. She freezes and slowly turns.

                    SARAH
               Frank?

     She eyes the supply room, looking for a sign of movement.

                    SARAH (cont'd)
                     (frightened whisper)
               Who's there?

     She listens. Is that breathing she hears? Now she's 
     starting to panic.

                    SARAH (cont'd)
               Dr. Caine?

     She starts to back away, but she's already in the corner. 
     She clutches her tranquilizer gun, but there's nothing to 
     aim at. The vials of blood on the shelf gives her an 
     idea. She reaches over, grabs a vial and throws it on the 
     floor. GLASS SHATTERS and BLOOD SMEARS across the 
     linoleum. Sarah tosses another vial and another. Becoming 
     more and more hysterical. Splattering more and more 
     blood. But she runs out of vials. Shaking with fear, she 
     searches the blood looking for a footprint, or movement. 
     But there's nothing there. Sarah waits a beat, clutching 
     the tranquilizer gun. Takes a step. Waits a beat longer.

     Finally she relaxes. It was just her imagination. She 
     heads toward the door when she hears a terrifying whisper 
     in her ear.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               You missed.

     Her hair flies up, and she swings against the wall. She 
     tries to move, but she's pinned there. Her hands 
     struggling against the force.

                    SARAH
               Please no. Let me go. Oh god, let me 
               go. 

     The arm holding the tranquilizer gun begins to move.

                    SARAH (cont'd)
               What are you doing? No!

     Sarah fights, but her arm moves nonetheless

                    SARAH (cont'd)
               Help me! Oh God. Somebody help me!
               FRANK!

     Slowly, deliberately, her own arm moves down the wall and 
     around, until the tranquilizer gun points right at her 
     stomach.

     Sarah watches in horror as her own body betrays her.

                    SARAH (cont'd)
               No... please. Don't do this to me.

     She struggles, shaking back and forth. Writhing. In 
     anguish and in fear.

                    SARAH (cont'd)
               What do you want?

                    SEBASTIAN
               You.

     The trigger pulls .... Pop!

     A dart explodes from the gun and imbeds in Sarah's 
     stomach. She whimpers as her eyes glass over. Suddenly 
     she's released. She stumbles backward and falls lifeless 
     to the floor. A moment of stillness, all we can hear is 
     the sound of someone breathing.

     On Sarah's face... a slight-indentation runs down her 
     cheek..

     Almost sweet... almost tender. And slight indentation 
     runs across her breast and strokes down her body. The 
     sense of violation and vulnerability is awful. Sebastian 
     sighs.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               I've always liked your feistiness. 

     Sarah's head shifts slightly. Her head shifts violently, 
     accompanied by the celery crunch of her neck snapping. 
     Sebastian exhales, his breath filled with the 
     intoxication of power.

     INT. LABORATORY - DAY

     Frank applies pressure to the wound, waiting for Sarah to 
     return. Carter's vital signs are weakening..,.

                    FRANK
               Sarah! Sarah!
                     (to Carter)
               Goddamnit. Stay with me now. Don't you 
               let up... Sarah! Sarah!

     No response. Frank doesn't know whether to stay or go 
     after her. He starts toward the door several times but 
     can't leave Carter. Finally the door opens.

                    FRANK (cont'd)
               Sarah! I'm losing him.

     But it's Linda and Matt.

                    FRANK (cont'd)
               Did you see her?

     Linda rushes over to check on Carter.

                    LINDA
               Where is she?

                    FRANK
               She went to the supply room. Carter 
               needed blood.

     Linda grabs a stethoscope and listens to Carter's heart.

                    LINDA
               I said no one goes anywhere alone.

                    FRANK
               She didn't listen.

     She-slowly pulls Frank's hand away from the wound.

                    FRANK (cont'd)
               But...

                    LINDA
               He's dead.

     Linda would love to cry about it, but doesn't afford 
     herself the luxury.

     INT. CORRIDOR

     The three of them approach the supply room door slowly. 
     Blood trickles from under the door and bloody footprints 
     extend down the hallway.

     They swing open the door.

     The floor is covered in blood and broken glass. But no 
     body.

     INT. CORRIDOR

     Sarah, broken, is dragged toward the chair, eerily 
     jerking down the hallway... seemingly on its own.

     INT. CORRIDOR

     The three scientists follow the bloody footprints down 
     the hallway past the empty cages in the tunnel of 
     habitats.

     All clutch their tranquilizer pistols.

     The footprints lead past the habitats to Sebastian's 
     chamber.

     They see Sarah's body in the dim light.

                    LINDA
               Oh god. Sarah!

     The group breaks into a run. Linda pushes into the 
     chamber and falls at Sarah's side. Matt cradles Sarah's 
     head. They look for some sign of life as Linda fights 
     back the tears.

                    LINDA (cont'd)
               No...

                    FRANK
               Her too?

     Matt nods. Linda slams the cubicle wall with her fist.

                    LINDA
               This didn't happen. This hasn't 
               happened.

                    MATT
               It happened alright. Now we have to 
               deal with it.

     Matt puts his hands on her shoulder to calm her. She 
     pushes him off.

                    FRANK
               Yeah? And just what are we supposed to 
               do now?

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               Now? Now you die.

     The three of them whip around.

                    LINDA
               He's here!

                    MATT
               Where?

                    LINDA
               Sebastian!

     Silence. The three cautiously move out. They stand back 
     to back, each one facing out. They move toward the door 
     of the Chamber.

                    LINDA (cont'd)
               Sebastian. Sebastian, listen to me.

     No response. They all their tranq pistols level waiting 
     for some sign. Hearing each other breathe. They slowly 
     move outside the Chamber into the corridor.

                    LINDA (CONT1D)
               I don't know if you can understand 
               this, but what you're experiencing is 
               a psychological breakdown. This isn't 
               who you are.

     A beat.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               I would say that what I am 
               experiencing is psychological 
               awareness. I like you being in 
               complete and absolute control.

     They identify the general area the voice is coming from: 
     Back inside the Chamber! They slowly move toward the 
     Chamber door. With lightning speed they slam the door 
     shut, locking Sebastian inside the Recovery Chamber.

                    LINDA
               You goddamn bastard! You goddamn 
               bastard. You're gonna pay for this. 
               I'm going to bring you back to 
               visibility and then I'm going throw 
               your ass in jail.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               You're never gonna bring me back 
               Linda. I never want to come back.

                    LINDA
               Fuck you!

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               Or maybe I'll fuck you. One last time 
               for old times sake.

     Linda slams her fist against the wall of the Chamber.

                    MATT
               Don't listen to him. It's not worth 
               it.

                    FRANK
               Come on, Matt. Let's go get the 
               elevator back on-line so we can got 
               out of this hell hole.

     Matt gives Linda a kiss...

                    MATT
               He does anything, anything at all, 
               come get us. I'll be back to check on 
               you in five.

     Matt and Frank head off down the corridor.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               Imagine you two, carrying on right 
               under my nose. Out of curiosity, what 
               did he give you that I couldn't?

                    LINDA
               Shut up, Sebastian. He's more of a man 
               than you'll ever be.

     INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     A VIDEO SCREEN shows Linda pacing outside the Chamber 
     door. The chair moves forward toward a microphone.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               Okay, sweetie. I'll be quiet. If 
               that's what you want...

     Sebastian TOGGLES the intercom switch OFF. We pan over to 
     one of the working video screens ... Matt and Frank 
     stride down the hallway. The chair swivels and the 
     observation room door swings open slightly.

     INT. CHAMBER

     Linda still holds his tranq gun toward the door. Nothing 
     moves. Nothing. Linda walks over to the Plexiglas ... 
     stares in. Can't see anything, anyone. Just the dead 
     Sarah.

     Then she sees it. The little red light on the intercom. 
     Its on.

                    LINDA
               Sebastian? Sebastian? No.. No...

     Linda bangs on the glass. She looks. No movement, no 
     nothing. She listens. Shit. She takes off running.

                    LINDA (cont'd)
               Matt! Frank! 

     Tracking with Linda as she rushes down the hall.

                    LINDA (cont'd)
               Matt! Matt! Frank!

     INT. LABORATORY - DAY

     Linda breaks in the room to see Frank slicked in blood, 
     his throat cut, and Matt bleeding from multiple stab 
     wounds with an extension cord around his neck being 
     pulled tight.

                    LINDA
               Jesus!

     Linda rushes over and slams into Matt. They fall to the 
     ground. Linda crawls over to Matt, but her head snaps 
     back and her lips erupt with blood.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               Figured it out? You were always so 
               clever.

     Matt's pulled back across the lab by the cord around his 
     neck. He grabs at the cord trying to breathe. Linda 
     watches him being pulled away.

                    LINDA
               No!

     She clamors over to him. But Matt rises in the air and is 
     tossed against the lab table. Linda levels her dart 
     pistol and fires haphazardly at the air. She hits nothing 
     but objects jerk and move in a line as Sebastian heads 
     for cover. Linda manages to grab Matt and pull him to 
     her.

                    LINDA (cont'd)
               Hang on!

                    MATT
               Get out of here!

     Linda pulls Matt toward the door.

                    LINDA
                     (yelling)
               You won't get away with this. They'll 
               find out about you. They'll hunt you 
               down.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               The villagers with their torches? Lock 
               up your daughters! Sorry, Lin. It's 
               not gonna happen that way.

     Linda hits the lights. The lab is now very, very dark.

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
               See, I've spent all my time down here 
               thinking up this plan. When they find 
               you, they'll find a pile of charred 
               corpses. The result of a terrible 
               accident, I'm afraid.

     Linda reacts to the voice as it grows nearer. She 
     navigates the maze of equipment, heading toward the crack 
     of light at the front door.

                    LINDA
               How can you be so brutal?

                    SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
               I guess because I don't have to look 
               at myself in the mirror anymore
                     (beat)
               Remember that first night I was out? I 
               did something bad, just to see if I 
               could get away with it. And when I 
               did, I realized I could have it all. I 
               can kill in broad daylight. And 
               nobody's gonna tell the police they 
               were fucked by a ghost. Anything I 
               desire I can make happen, but not if 
               people know.

     Linda and Matt have reached the door of the lab. She 
     pushes through it and slams it behind her.

     INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

     Linda pulls Matt along.

                    MATT
               I'm dizzy. I can't feel my legs.

                    LINDA
               Just keep going. I'll fix you later.

     INT. CORRIDOR, LAB DOORS - DAY

     The doors explode open.

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     Linda looks up and down the hall and pulls Matt inside 
     the supply room. It's still blood soaked from earlier.

     Linda closes the door, sliding the deadbolt into place.

     Linda lots him drop like a heap onto the floor. She falls 
     to her knees beside Matt, lying on the ground.

                    LINDA
               Matt... Matthew. Stay with me now. 

     Linda pulls his scrubs open. The wounds are many and 
     deep.

                    MATT
               He surprised us. We weren't 
               expecting...

                    LINDA
               Shhh. Don't talk.

     BAM! Something slams against the door. Bam! Slams against 
     it again. The old deadbolt is buckling. Linda looks 
     around the room and sees the storage freezer.

                    LINDA (cont'd)
               We gotta move. Hang on.

     Linda helps Matt up and into the storage freezer.

     INT. STORAGE FREEZER

     Linda grabs a metal bar and slides it between two hooks 
     on the door and the jam.

     BAM! The storage room door blows open. Linda leans down 
     next to Matt.

                    MATT
               Lin...

     He entire shirt is stained with blood. He's having 
     trouble breathing.

                    MATT (cont'd)
               I can't feel anything.

     Linda picks up his hand. Grips it tight.

                    LINDA
               You feel that?

     Matt smiles.

                    MATT
               A little...

     She rips his shirt open... and sees his wounds. She grabs 
     a vial of alcohol and dumps it on her hands and then 
     probes the wound.

                    LINDA
               Your losing blood, but he didn't hit 
               the vitals.

     She looks around.

                    LINDA (cont'd)
               Sutures and thread.

     She rises, and looks outside the porthole into the room. 
     Suddenly it fogs up and she almost sees a face. She 
     stumbles backward, and the door starts rattling. Linda 
     scrambles over to hold the metal crowbar in place. 
     Sebastian pulls and rattles on the freezer door. To no 
     avail. It's not gonna budge. Finally he gives up. The 
     door stops shaking. Linda is relieved, briefly.  Still. 
     Then she hears the click of the door locking.

     OUTSIDE THE FREEZER

     CLOSE ON THE REGULATOR as the dial turns from forty-five 
     degrees, down to negative twenty.

     INSIDE THE FREEZER

     Through the porthole, Linda sees the bloody footprints 
     heading toward the door. She removes the metal bar and 
     pushes on the door. It won't move.

                    LINDA
               Goddamnit.

     Linda looks around the storage room. She grabs a roll of 
     duct tape and pulls off a length.

                    MATT
               What're you doing?

                    LINDA
               This is temporary.

     She takes paper towel and cleans off Matt's wound. She 
     tapes it, using duct tape.

                    LINDA (cont'd)
               You still with me?

                    MATT
               Barely.

     A beat later, the compressor begins pumping Arctic air 
     into the freezer.

                    LINDA
               Just keeps getting worse.

     Linda returns to the door. Shakes it.

     INT. CHAMBER - DAY

     We hear WHISTLING as we see a sheet of flesh fill out 
     into a head as Sebastian slides on his latex head piece.

     INT. STORAGE FREEZER

     Linda continues shaking the door. The lock holds. A tear 
     rolls down Linda's cheek, but a strange thing happens. 
     The tear drops freeze. Linda shivers as she pulls the icy 
     tears from her face.

                    LINDA
               Oh shit.

     The inside thermometer has dropped to five degrees.

     Linda grabs the metal bar and starts smashing it against 
     the porthole. The metal bar just bounces off the glass.

     INT. SEBASTIAN'S OFFICE

     A drawer opens, revealing a set of clothing neatly 
     folded. Shirt, pants, shoes. They begin to move.

     INT. STORAGE FREEZER

     Linda drops the metal bar and slides down the wall, 
     defeated.

                    MATT
               There's no way out.

                    LINDA
               There's got to be.

                    MATT
               They say freezing to death isn't so 
               bad. You just kinda pass out.

     Matt's head rolls back.

                    LINDA
               Matt! MATT!

     She checks his pulse. Thank god he still has one, but 
     he's not gonna last long. They're both already starting 
     to turn a little blue. Linda stares desperately up at the 
     shelves, trying to find some sort of advantage. Then she 
     sees something. She looks back at the door lock and then 
     she rises ... and grabs AN EXTENSION CORD coiled on the 
     shelf.

                    LINDA (cont'd)
               We're not dying in here.


     INT. BATHROOM - DAY

     Sebastian, dressed in street clothes, stands before the 
     mirror applying make-up to his latex mask.

     INT. STORAGE FREEZER

     Linda finishes stripping the insulation off the electric 
     cord. 

     She grabs a hypodermic needle package, and her cold 
     fingers fumbles with the package as she tries to pull out 
     the plastic tube.

     She finally gets it out and she starts wrapping the 
     stripped electric wire around the tube in a tight coil.

     INT. BATHROOM - DAY

     Sebastian slides on a wig and checks his appearance in 
     the mirror. Pretty smooth. Even from relatively close up, 
     he could pass as normal.

     INT. STORAGE FREEZER

     Linda furiously winds wire into a coil.

     INT. CORRIDOR

     Sebastian heads down the corridor. Lingering steam twists 
     in and around the hallway, long wispy tendrils. Sebastian 
     pauses for a moment, hearing A GROWL. Suddenly the 
     hallway seems a lot scarier. From beneath his scrubs he 
     pulls his own tranq gun. He listens ... hearing scraping 
     and footsteps. Watching the water on the floor twitch. 
     With machine like precision, he turns and fires. The 
     tranq dart halts in mid-air and some invisible thing 
     tumbles over.

     Sebastian continues down the hallway.

     INT. STORAGE FREEZER

     Linda holds the plug end of the extension cord. The other 
     end is wrapped into a tight long coil. Linda looks for an 
     outlet, but can't find one. She looks at the overhead 
     lights.

     A moment later she's climbing up the shelving. She wrap* 
     a piece of fabric around her hand, and with a sharp punch 
     she smashes one of the overhead light bulbs.

     INT. LABORATORY

     Sebastian enters, fully dressed. At a distance it'd be 
     hard to tell his secret. He pulls several chemicals off 
     the shelves. Then he pulls a tray of test tubes over and 
     begins mixing.

     INT. STORAGE FREEZER

     Linda works on jerry rigging the two ends of the wire to 
     the lightbulb, socket. 
     Suddenly the coiled wire springs to life and flies 
     against the nearest metal surface. She's made an 
     electromagnet.

     INT. LABORATORY

     Sebastian loads the filled test tubes into the 
     centrifuge. Dozens of other vials are already slotted. He 
     takes one of the left over vials, considers it a moment 
     and then flings it over to the other side of the lab. The 
     vial shatters and...

     EXPLODES.

     A powerful explosion that rocks the room.

     INT. STORAGE FREEZER

     Linda feels the rumbling as she places the coil up 
     against the door. The magnet attaches itself. Linda 
     shakes the coil, trying to get the doorlock to move.

     OUTSIDE THE DOOR -

     We see the lock twitching. Shaking...

     INSIDE THE DOOR -

     Linda shivers as she plays with the coil. Her eyes glaze 
     and she stumbles backward. Her surgical scrubs, once 
     soaked with sweat, are now frozen stiff. She composes 
     herself and pushes back toward the door. Her heavy breath 
     hangs as a low cloud of Mist.

     INT. LABORATORY - DAY

     Sebastian looks over the dozens of other test tubes, 
     calculating their combined power in his mind. Then he 
     closes the top of the centrifuge. He taps a few commands 
     into its timer.

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM

     The door lock twitches again and twists back. The door 
     swings opens and Linda stumbles out, mashing into a 
     supply shelf of oxygen canisters. The canisters tumble 
     every which way as Linda tumbles to the ground.

     She scrambles to her feet and goes in after Matt, pulling 
     his cold body out of the storage locker.

     She pulls stacks of paper down from, the shelves into a 
     trashcan, grabs an industrial lighter and ignites the 
     paper. She pushes Matt close to the small bonfire. As she 
     does, the oxygen tanks catch her eye.

     INT. CORRIDOR

     Sebastian exits the lab, locking the door behind him. He 
     heads down the darkened tunnel. Something scampers in 
     front of him. Small, not visible. Sebastian sends it 
     reeling with a swift violent kick.

     INT. CORRIDOR, BY THE ELEVATOR - DAY

     Sebastian, dressed and in full latex, comes striding up 
     the tunnel. He taps a code into the elevator vault doors. 
     The vault doors open revealing the elevator.

     The doors slide open and Sebastian steps inside.

                    ELEVATOR
               Authorization please?

                    SEBASTIAN
               Caine. One One One One One.

                    ELEVATOR
               Authorization valid. Thank you.

                    LINDA
               Sebastian!

     And there's Linda. Slicked with dirt and blood. She holds 
     a oxygen container with a cut line.

                    LINDA (cont'd)
               I can't let you leave. Come on out and 
               I'll give you one last chance.

                    SEBASTIAN
               You said it yourself, Lin. I shouldn't 
               hold on to the past.

     The door starts to shut.

                    LINDA
               Aaaaaaahhhh!

     She hits the top of a LIGHTER duct-taped to the hose. A 
     line of PRESSURIZED FIRE BLOWS into the elevator. 
     WWHHHOOOOSSHHHH! Sebastian goes up in flame. Linda runs 
     toward the elevator. Just as the door's about to close, 
     she slides. Her foot jamming into it. 
     She lets loose with the flame again. Sebastian, backed 
     into the corner, has no where to go. He's yelling in 
     pain. His latex FACE BUBBLES and burns. The surgical 
     scrubs SINGE BLACK. With no other escape route, he dives 
     toward the door. Linda looks up to see his flaming body 
     fly over her, back into the corridor. Linda kills the 
     tank as Sebastian continues to burn. The elevator lights 
     flickers and the security panel goes up in a shower of 
     sparks. The elevator dies. Linda pulls herself to her 
     feet and turns to see...

     Half of Sebastian's head MELTED AWAY, his latex facade a 
     gruesome smoke-damaged mass. His clothes are half burned 
     revealing large blistering bubbly welts underneath, like 
     deformed blackened bubble wrap.

     Sebastian crawls to his feet, but Linda hits him with 
     another shot of flame.

     Sebastian pulls at his clothes as he crawls around the 
     corner.

                    SEBASTIAN
               Oh God!

     Linda stalks toward him.

                    LINDA 
               You wanna see God? I'll show you God. 

     Linda turns the corner to see a heap of smoldering latex 
     and clothing strewn about the corridor floor. Sebastian, 
     looking like some ugly creature, pushes down the 
     corridor. He throbs with his blackened skin blistering 
     and cracking up and down his body. Linda lets loose 
     another jet of flame. It's smaller than the first and 
     doesn't quite hit Sebastian. Linda checks the tanks 
     pressure gauge. It slowly drops. Linda follows the 
     blackened horror into the maze of tunnels. But as he 
     pushes along the corridor, his burns slowly re- absorb 
     themselves. Sebastian is no longer visible. A quiet 
     moment in the hallway as Linda realizes how vulnerable 
     she is. She looks around for him desperately. Nothing. 
     But something on the ceiling catches her attention. She 
     blasts it with the last jet of her dying torch. THE 
     SPRINKLER SYSTEM, hit by fire, comes to life. Water 
     sprays down on the tunnel. Sebastian is caught in the 
     downpour, his invisible frame outlined by water. It comes 
     toward her, the hot skin steaming in the water. He grabs 
     Linda and slams her against the wall. His watery hand 
     smashes her across her face. Linda reels. On the floor, 
     she looks to see Sebastian stalking toward her. She 
     crawls away, but he grabs her by her hair, pulls her to 
     her feet and slams her against the wall.

                    SEBASTIAN
               I'm gonna find everyone in your family 
               and kill them-. Your sister... she 
               never liked me. I think I'll go after 
               her and her little boy first. 

     Sebastian smashes her head against a metal post. Her head 
     cuts open, blood dripping down.

                    SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               I just wanted you to know that before 
               you die.

     Linda collapses to the floor. Sebastian's foot presses 
     against her neck, squeezing it. Linda gags for breath. 
     But through the shoot of water that is Sebastian, we see 
     something also... a watery smudge.

     BAM!

     MATT - smashes Sebastian with the metal bar. Sebastian 
     slams against the corridor wall and sinks down.

     Matt staggers. It's taken all his strength to got there. 
     He drops the crowbar and seeks the wall for support, he 
     sinks to his knees by Linda.

                    MATT
               Thought I'd... thought I'd save you 
               for a change.

     He gives her his hand and pulls her up into his arms.

                    MATT (cont'd)
               Let's got out of here.

     Just as the two turn, Sebastian rises with the crowbar. 
     He swings it with a yell. Matt pushes Linda out of the 
     way, his arm glancing the blow into a conduit. The 
     conduit splits open and severs ELECTRICAL wiring. The 
     VOLTAGE shoots up the crowbar and into Sebastian. As the 
     current pulses through his body, Sebastian vibrates. His 
     blood vessels yank back to visibility, followed by his 
     skeletal structure and major organs. Sebastian is slowly 
     electrified. Smoke pours off him and he becomes more and 
     more visible. Finally he collapses. His body throbbing in 
     and out of visibility. Matt and Linda stumble away.

     INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

     Just outside the lab... Linda tries to pry open the 
     sealed doors with the crowbar. But she can't.

     Through the doors porthole she sees a collection of 
     chemicals and the fire raging from the earlier explosion.

                    LINDA
               Nitro...

     Matt peaks inside.

                    MATT
               He said it himself... All they'll find 
               is a pile of charred corpses.

     She sees the centrifuge... The timed counter on its face 
     counts down from a minute. Fifty nine. Fifty eight. Fifty 
     seven...

                    LINDA
               He's rigged the centrifuge.

                    MATT
               In an enclosed space, he'll wipe out 
               the whole lab.

     INT. TUNNEL

     Linda and Matt move as fast as they can. They reach the 
     burned out elevator. What the hell are they gonna do? We 
     know the damn thing doesn't work. She swings her crowbar 
     at the ceiling. The maintenance hatch comes down.

                    LINDA
               Grab on.

     Linda hooks the crowbar onto the hatch lip and pulls 
     herself up. She reaches back down for Matt.

                    MATT
               Forget about me. You go.

                    LINDA
               Fuck you. Give me your hands.

     Linda grabs Matt's hands and pulls for all she's worth. 
     She struggles, but they both manage to got him through 
     the hatch.

     INT. LABORATORY - DAY

     Three... two... one. The centrifuge springs to life.

     The centrifuge spins the two dozen vials slowly at first.

     INT. VENT

     Linda and Matt are on top of the elevator.

     Linda's hands search the wall. Bar fingers run across the 
     smooth metal surface.

     From the little light below she can see a maintenance 
     ladder that spans the entire height of the vertical tube. 
     They look up and see it disappear into the darkness.

                    LINDA
               Climb!

                    MATT
               But...

                    LINDA
               Climb!

     Matt starts up, rung after rung. Linda climbs right 
     behind him.

     INT. LABORATORY

     The centrifuge spins faster and faster. The vials are 
     starting to rattle.

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT

     Linda and Matt pull themselves up the ladder as quick as 
     they can.

                    MATT
               I can't. I'm going to pass out.

                    LINDA
               Keep moving.

     He does, through sheer force of will. Blood from his 
     wound drips down on Linda's face. No telling how much 
     further they have to go in this darkness. Light leaks in 
     from the maintenance hatch below.

     INT. LABORATORY

     The centrifuge's whine has reached a fevered pitch. The 
     vials shake violently.

     Then... one of the vials shatters.

     A FLASH OF LIGHT. A HUGE EXPLOSION rips through the 
     laboratory.

     INT. TUNNEL

     The EXPLOSION rips through the lab doors. A MASSIVE 
     FIREBALL rolls down the tunnel swallowing everything in 
     its path.

     One of the phase shifted animals gets caught in the 
     flames. We see its shape briefly before it disappears In 
     a wall of fire.

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT

     The ladder begins to shake. The entire shaft begins to 
     rumble. Linda pushes Matt up as they scramble toward 
     safety.

     INT. EXHAUST VENT

     The FIREBALL blows into the vent. Starts rolling down it 
     also.

     INT. TUNNELS

     More explosions.

     CHAIN REACTIONS. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

     THE EXPLOSIONS rolls toward the OPEN ELEVATOR. Slamming 
     into it... The elevator flies upward.

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT

     The rumbling worsens. The two desperately cling to the 
     ladder. They looks down to see...

     The elevator...

     SURROUNDED BY FLAMES flying up toward them, lifted by the 
     explosion's SHOCK WAVES.

                    LINDA
               Oh God!

                    MATT
               Don't look.

     The carriage accelerates toward them, faster and faster. 
     Its loose cables whip around the shaft, slapping the 
     walls around the pair. Its gonna hit them! Linda pulls 
     herself close to the ladder and closes her eyes. She's 
     pressed against Matt. The elevator... 50 feet... 40 ... 
     30 ... W0000000SH! It flames RIGHT BY THEM. 
     When Linda opens her eyes, the elevator is HUNDREDS OF 
     FEET ABOVE THEM and a wall of fire is below them, closing 
     in.

                    LINDA
               Move!

     Panicked, Linda pushes Matt up the ladder as she stares 
     down at the rising fire wall. But the fire dissipates 
     before it hits them, though a stray tongue of flames 
     reaches up to lick the soles of her feet.

     They hear a terrifying moan and looks up to see the 
     elevator peaking far above her. It slows to a stop and 
     BEGINS TO FALL.

                    MATT
               It's coming down!

     FASTER AND FASTER. Coming back toward them in complete 
     free- fall. It's emergency brakes clamp down, slowing it. 
     Metal against metal. Sparks flying. One of the brakes 
     shears. Then another. The elevator unseats from it's 
     tracks, SLAMMING against the walls as it TUMBLES. Linda 
     sees that the elevator is out of control, and watches as 
     it ping-pongs toward them... smashing into the access 
     ladder, smashing into the wall. The elevator slows, but 
     continues slamming side-to-side. Linda cringes as the 
     elevator crashes into the wall above them. But it jams 
     there, stopping. They pull their heads away from wall and 
     look up. The elevator just hangs there, suspended. 
     There's a small crawlspace between the elevator and the 
     ladder.

                    LINDA
               C'mon. Before it slips.

     They begins to climb up again. Matt shimmies through the 
     tight hollow, and squeezes out the other side, followed 
     by Linda. She breathes a sigh of relief and just hangs 
     there a moment when ... Ah! Something grabs her. A singed 
     throbbing hand emerges from the darkness, gripping at her 
     leg.

                    LINDA (cont'd)
               It's him.

     She kicks at it and sees a dark dirty face - a swirl of 
     dirt, grime and smoke with hollow eyes - rise up the 
     ladder.

                    MATT
               Sebastian, you fuck.

                    LINDA
               Get off me.

     Sebastian pulls himself up Linda's body. Translucent 
     dirty hands paving at the fabric of her clothes. Linda 
     tries to climb with this thing on her. But Sebastian 
     grabs her around the neck. She begins choking for breath. 
     Linda fights to keep her grip on the ladder... She looks 
     down at the ten foot drop to the elevator and then... She 
     lets go!

                    MATT
               No!

     She and Sebastian plummet through the smoky haze and slam 
     against the top of the elevator. Linda seems to hover a 
     few above the elevator, Sebastian's shadowy outline below 
     her. Matt painfully lowers himself down the ladder. But 
     metal groans and the elevator drops another five feet. 
     Linda struggles to her feet. Sebastian rises. A menacing 
     dark figure stalking toward her. Linda pushes back from 
     him. Sebastian grabs her by the hair and pulls bar over 
     to the ladder. The elevator strains and groans.

                    LINDA
               Let go of me.

     Sebastian presses her up against the ladder. Presses into 
     her from behind. He has her trapped. His dirty hand 
     reaches out and strokes her hair.

                    SEBASTIAN
               Remember the day we met? You were 
               wearing a red dress and you were so 
               pretty. Now... Now look at you.

                    MATT
               Get off of her!

     Sebastian pulls her hair back and kisses her neck with 
     his filthy, dirt-smeared mouth and half-burned away face.

                    MATT (cont'd)
               Sebastian, stop it.

     Linda and Sebastian struggle. Matt reaches down to try 
     and grab her, help her.

                    SEBASTIAN
               You fucked it all up.

     Linda looks at her feet. The last elevator emergency 
     brake grips its cable. She grits her tooth and grabs hold 
     of the ladder.

                    LINDA
               Go to hell. 

     Linda stamps on the brake release. The ELEVATOR TUMBLES 
     ... along with Sebastian. It slams into the fiery abyss a 
     hundred yards below. Linda hangs, one hand holding onto 
     the ladder, the other holding onto Matt. Matt pulls her 
     back onto the ladder, using all his remaining strength.

     EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

     Linda and Matt stumble out into the blazing sunshine. 
     Emergency crews close from all directions, sirens 
     roaring. A trail of smoke drifts higher and higher into 
     the sky.

     An ambulance pulls up next to them and the paramedics hop 
     out, immediately putting a blanket around her and 
     treating Matt's wounds.

                    MARINE GUARD
               What happened?

                    LINDA
               We lived.

     Linda looks over her shoulder at the traces of the ruin 
     and she sees a shimmer of heat rising from the ground... 
     almost as if something was there.

                                              FADE
