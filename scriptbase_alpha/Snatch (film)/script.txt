1·    EXT. RUSSIA -- NIGHT




      We open on a GUARD sitting in front of a sentry post. He is
      wearing a heavy fur hat that covers his ears and a military-
      jacket. Behind him is a list of instructions (in Russian).
      He 'sucks in a cigarette as though he's a drowning man lookin
      for oxygen. A CAR comes to a stop by the sentry post, the,
      guard looks, asks a couple of questions and is given an
     -envelope which he quickly examines, he then attempts to stick
      his head in the car. A gun barrel is promptly stuck in his
      face and a couple of angry words emanate from the back, the
      guard jumps back and quickly raises the barrier.

2    INT. BACK OF RUSSIAN CAR -- NIGHT

     On the back seat is FRANKY FOUR -FINGERS, (New York street
     wise Jew) who is clutching a fancy looking briefcase which
     is handcuffed to his wrist. He is flanked by TWO RUSSIAN
     HOODS. This next section will be subtitled.

                           FRANKY FOUR FINGERS

               How much further do we have to go?
     Just then the car comes to a standstill. The window is wound
     down and a gun barrel is stuck through. The RUSSIAN DRIVER
     looks dramatically calm.

                           RUSSIAN

               Pass him the money.
     Franky hesitates for a second.

                           RUSSIAN (CONT'D)

               Franky you know you have no choice.
               So please can we get on with it?
      Franky knows discussion is futile. He flips the case open
      and pulls out a transparent plastic bag full of American
      dollars. The package is pulled out of the window, the driver
      doesn't move, we dissolve for a passage of time, the anxiety
      is more than obvious, but Four Fingers can do nothing. All
      of a sudden a package comes through the window and the car
      speeds off without waiting for an inspection of the delivery.

    Franky opens the package and he reveals a stone the size of
    a fist. He shines a torch onto it and puts a stone inspectin
    monocle to his eye. He's satisfied.

    Franky Four Fingers opens a fancy case, presses a hidden
    catch, this reveals a second wall within the case, he then
    carefully places the stone within this secret compartment
    and firmly closes the case. The Russian next to him is
    playing with a revolver, he spins the chamber.

    We are in the back room of an amusement arcade and can hear
    fruit machines beeping in the distance. Meet BORIS THE BLADE
    and TOMMY who is toying with a heavy-looking revolver.

                             TOMMY

                 It's a bit heavy isn't it Boris?

                             BORIS

                 Heavy is good. Heavy is reliable.
                 If it doesn't work you can hit him
                 with it.
    Tommy practices a couple of gun slinging maneuvers. He's
    impressed. At that moment the door opens and in walks a MAN
    carrying two heavy sacks of coins. He's a rough looking
    bastard, he's massive, and extremely ugly. Meet GORGEOUS

    GEORGE.

                            TOMMY

                Yes Gorgeous?
      George looks at the weapon and can see that he's interrupting.

                            GORGEOUS GEORGE

                Sorry Tommy, I hope that I am not
                interrupting.

                            TOMMY

                Oh of course you're not interrupting
                Gorgeous, I put the do not disturb
                sign on the door because I wanted
                you to join us.
      George isn't too bright

                            GORGEOUS GEORGE

                What are you doing Tommy?

                              TOMMY

                I am baking a cake Gorgeous, not
                that i t ' s any of your business. Put
                the takings down, and be a good chap.
    -. George puts down the coins. Tommy implies he should leave.
       Gorgeous isn't too bright and continues to stand there looking
       stupid. Tommy goes to turn around but can see that he hasn't
       left, so he turns back,

                            TOMMY (CONT'D)

                Is there anything else Gorgeous, a
                cup of tea perhaps? No? Well in
                that could you kindly fuck off and
                shut the door behind you?



      Tommy turns round to Boris with a slight shake of his head.

                            TOMMY (CONT'D)

                Not too bright but he hits like a
                train. OK I ' l l take it. You're a
                gambling man Boris, so I'll toss you
                for it. Heads it's mine, tails I'll
                give you twice the price.
      Boris chews this for a second.

                                  BORIS

                   I ' l l toss the coin.
      He tosses the coin

              You're gonna have to get someone

7   EX.T. BACK ALLEY MAKESHIFT BOXING RING -- DAY

    BRICK TOP (aka MR MCLEAN) is a heavy looking fella. He is
    observing a giant of a man, BOMBER HARRIS, boxing a sparring
    partner.

                          BRICK TOP

              Two hundred and sixty pounds, that's
              fucking pedigree pal.
    He's talking to LIAM and GARY, a couple of employees.

                          BRICK TOP (CONT'D)

              He doesn't look bad does he?

                          GARY

              Oh no Mr Mclean, he looks great.

                             LIAM

              Yeah great.

                          GARY

              He'll kill him, he'll do you proud
              governor.

                          BRICK TOP

              Do you reckon that's what people
              should do for me, do you Gary, do me
              proud?

                          GARY

              That's what you deserve Mr Mclean.

             a dog, are you Gary?
    Taken aback by the change in tone.




                         GARY

             Err no, I am not.

                         BRICK TOP

             However, you do have all of the
             characteristics of a dog Gary, all
             except loyalty.
    There is a definite change in temperature.

                           BRICK TOP (CONT'D)

             And people like dogs Gary, for the
             principal reason that they're loyal.
             So I don't quite know where that
             leaves you my old son, other than
             refuckinpugnant. . .
    There is a problem

                         BRICK TOP (CONT'D)

             Which one was it that kept the four
             grand from the Clapham job?
    Pause

                         BRICK TOP (CONT'D)

             Don't let me ask again. I would
             like answers, but I am not in the
             mood for asking questions, get busy
             lads, or it's feeding time, oink,
             oink, know what I mean?
    Liam takes a step to the side and moves his eyes in a sideways
    action implying the guilt lies with Gary. Gary catches this
    and opens his mouth to protest. One of Brick Tops's henchmen,
    ERROL, sticks a belt in there as quick as it opens and smashes
    a bar across Gary's legs, he buckles. The henchman man pulls
    out a plastic bag and a roll of tape.

                            BRICK TOP (CONT'D')

                 You know what to do with that don't
                 you Liam?

    CUT TO FIGHTERS. SMALLER FIGHTER IS DISTRACTED.

    POV of Smaller Fighter, we witness Liam putting the bag over

    poor Gary.

    Brick Top turns away at this point to admire his fighter.

                             BRICK TOP (CONT'D)

                 But I got no time for grasses.



    We cut to see Liam's panic filled eyes. The bar comes down
    again. Brick Top finds more interest in his fighter.

                             BRICK TOP (CONT'D)

                 Feed em to the pigs Errol.
    With a short beat.

                 not? How's their man getting on?
    We whip pan off Brick Top's boxing ring...

8   EXT. ANOTHER BACK ALLEY MAKESHIFT BOXING RING - - DAY

    ...And the whip pan shot takes us into this boxing ring.
    Meet TURKISH, he is Tommy's partner. Turkish is older and
    wiser than Tommy, they are both watching Gorgeous go through
    his paces. Gorgeous George is head butting a heavy punch
    bag. The sound that emanates is disturbing, and Tommy is
    distracted.

                             TOMMY

                 Is he allowed to do that?
    Turkish is drinking milk from a bottle

                              TURKISH (CONT'D)

              Look at it.



    He turns to see the remnants of a caravan where they keep
    the training gear and administration for the fights

                          TURKISH (CONT'D)

              How am I supposed to run this thing
              from that? We gonna need a proper
              office.
    He looks at the caravan again and sighs, it is quite pitiful

                          TURKISH (CONT'D)

              I want a new one Tommy and you 're
              going to buy it for me.

                          TOMMY

              What's wrong with this one?
    Turning back to Tommy and ascending the steps in to his "I
    have seen better days" caravan, TURKISH'S foot goes through
    one of the stairs and the.door comes off at the hinges as he
    tries to open it.

                          TURKISH

              Oh nothing Tommy, it's tip top, it's
              just I am not sure about the colour.
    He passes him a piece of paper

                          TURKISH (CONT'D)

              Here it's all arranged. You just
              gotta pick it up. Here's an address.
    Tommy looks at the address and frowns.

                                TOMMY

                 I t ' s that campsite.

                             TURKISH

                 That's right, you're buying a caravan,
                 caravans live in campsites.

             No Tommy, there's a gun in your

             your trousers?

                          TOMMY

             It's for protection.

                         TURKISH

             Protection from what, the Germans?
             The war ended fifty years ago. Err

             off every time you sit down? Where
             did you get it?
Looking down onto his gun.

     DOUG THE HEAD is an east London Jew, about forty five, almost
     completely bald and proud of it, he sits with his two twin
     daughters ALEX and SUSI - they look like Prada models but as
     soon as they open their mouths, it's clear that they aren't,
     they have extremely rough London accents. Doug is on the
     phone to Hands.




                                 DOUG

                  I am playing the game Hands. That's

                              TOMMY

                  Well what are you waiting for?




                              KID 1

                  The five quid you are going to pay
                  me.
     Chuckling.

                              TOMMY

                  Oh fuck off, I'll find him myself.

                                KID 1

                  Two fifty.

                              TOMMY

                  You can have a quid.

                              KID 1

                  Oh you're a tight fucker aren't ya?
     A man shouts from the background. He's a young fella with a
     hard but friendly face (when he smiles). He's covered in
     grease and facial hair, and his trousers are done up with
     string. But he's wearing a Cartier watch and Gucci shoes,
     and a large gold identity bracelet. This is MICKY O'NEILL.

                              MIC KY

                  What are you doing Paul? Get out of
                  the way boy. Are you Tommy, have
                  you come about the caravan?

                                TOMMY

                  Mr O'Neill?

                              MICKY

                  Fuck man, call me Micky.
     Micky comes up to the car, cleaning his grease covered hands
     with a hand towel.

                                TOMMY

                  How are ya?

                 weather is being kind to us but the
                 engines aren't.



     Gorgeous George steps out of the car.      Micky takes a step
     back.

                             MICKY (CONT'D)

                 Fuck me, would you look at the size
                 of him, Jesus man how big are you?
                 Hey kids how fucking big is he?

                 He's a big man that's for sure.

                             MICKY

                 Would you look at the size of his
                 muscles? And then look at the size
                 of his fists. Hey Mum, come and
                 look at the size of this fella.
     The kids start to feel his arms. Gorgeous George plays the
     game and raises the kids on his biceps. Micky's MUM comes
     out to see.

                             MICKY (CONT'D)

                 Would you look at the strength of
                 the man? I bet you can box a little
                 can't you sir? You look like a boxer.

                             MUM

                 Get out of the way Micky and see if
                 the fellas would like a drink.

                             TOMMY

                 I could murder one.

                             MUM

                 There won't be any murdering done
                 around here, I don't mind telling
                 ya.

                             MICKY

                 Would the big fella like a cup of
                 tea?

                             MUM

                 Don't be silly Micky, a man didn't
                 get that size from drinking cups of
                 tea. Offer the man a Guiness boy.

                             KID 2

     Tommy and Gorgeous follow Micky who's walking past a kennel.
     The dogs are in good condition, and are happy as you like to
     see. Micky stops and gives one of them a stroke.

                             MICKY

                 Good dogs, do you like dogs?

                             TOMMY

                 Sure, yeah, I like dogs.   I like
                 caravans more.

15   INT. TYRONE'S CAR

     We open on Vinny's dog, now sitting in a car, it's breathing
     heavily and doesn't look well, and Sol doesn't see the funny
     side of the dog sitting next to him. The man driving is
     called TYRONE: he's a white guy who thinks he's black. Vin
     is also in the car.

                             TYRONE

                 I don't want him dribbling on my             ,
                 seats man.

                             SOL

                 Give him another of those biscuits.
                 They shut him up.

                             VINNY

                 They give him wind.
     Tyrone turns round to complain, and narrowly misses a car.

                             VINNY (CONT'D)

                 Hey watch the road! Fuck me, you
                 want this man to drive us Sol? Can
                 you drive mate?

                             SOL

                 No Vin, he can't tell the difference
                 between a steering wheel and a man
               . on the moon. That' s why I got him.
     Sol gives the dog another biscuit.

                             TYRONE

                 Don't you worry about me, jus worry
                 about the dog on my seats man!
     Tyrone gets out of the car to put some petrol in.

                           SOL

               I don't know Vin. Oi Tyrone, Vin
               wants to know why you talk like a
               black man?

                           TYRONE

               Roots and ting, seen?



     Sol and Vin raise their eyebrows.

                           VINNY

               Roots and what?

                           SOL

               I don't know. You get that gun from
               Boris?

                           VINNY

               Got it. It wasn't exactly what I
               was expecting, mind. Mean looking
               bastard though, that's for sure.
     Sol unzips a bag.     Inside is a ridiculously powerful shotgun.

                           SOL

               What's that?

                              VINNY

                  It's a shotgun Sol.

                             SOL

               I t ' s a fuckin anti-aircraft gun Vin.
               What are you planning on shooting,
               the angels out of the clouds? That's
               gonna raise more than pulses.

                              VINNY

                  It will raise hell my old son.

                          SOL

              I don't think I really want to see

              gun?

                              VINNY

                  The are psychological advantages to
                  a gun that looks like it can perforate
                  the moon.

     Tyrone gets into the car, starts it up again and puts some
     money in the car wash machine.

                             SOL

                 Can you get this fuckin dog to stop
                 dribbling on me?
     Vin pulls the dog back.

                              SOL (CONT'D)

                 I worry about you Vin, Jesus, talk
                 about overkill. One look at a crack
                 desperate brother and you could wave
                 a knife and fork around, and I am
                 sure they would lick the salt of
                 your scrotum.
     The car wash starts.

                             VINNY

                 What the fuck are you doing?

                             TYRONE

                 I never do a job unless I have a
                 clean car, I like to make my wheels
                 look crisp.

                             VINNY

                 Are you serious,? You' re a getaway
                 driver, you're not here to show your
                 fuckin car off.               ··.
     The machine starts. They do the windows up and that point
     the dog lets out a fart. The water starts to hit the
     windshield so they can't undo the windows. There is more an
     atmosphere of disbelief than of concrete anger.

16   EXT. CARAVAN CAMP SITE




     Gorgeous George fastens the caravan to the back of their
     Land Rover and pulls away. They wave at Micky and he
     reciprocates.

                             MICKY

                 He's a good dog. He'll get a little
                 homesick for a while but he'11 get
                 over it.
     Tommy has a dog that looks distressed about leaving Micky
     sitting next to him.

               I don't know what all your fuss was
               about. They aren't bad fellas.
     Just then the wheels of the caravan come straight off and
     the caravan is dragged until the car comes to a sudden stop.
     The dog jumps out the window and goes bounding back to the
     campsite.

18   EXT. CARAVAN -- DAY




     They are looking at the damage.   Of course i t ' s completely
     useless now.

               I don't think it's supposed to have
               done that.

     The dog is behind Micky's legs happy to be back.

                           MICKY

               The deal was you bought it how you
               saw it.
      Tommy goes to interrupt but he doesn't get a chance

                           MICKY (CONT'D)

               Look, I have helped ya as much as I

               car and I suggest you use it before
               you're not welcome anymore.
     There is a silence for a while. The atmosphere has gone
     more than frosty and a few more gypsies are hanging around.

                           GORGEOUS GEORGE

               It was only a question of time before
               you got some attention. Nobody brings
               a fella the size of you unless they
               are trying to say something without
               talking.

                           TOMMY

     Micky's Mum is getting upset and it's consequently upsetting
     Micky.

                  Okay mum okay. You need to sit down.

     We see Mum being led out by Darren; Micky looks genuinely
     concerned for his mum. Pause as Micky waits for her to be
     well gone.

     Tommy looks at Gorgeous George.        Gorgeous George raises his
     eyebrows.

20   INT. HORSE BOX, PIKEY CAMP -- DAY

     The two fighters start pacing. It looks a bit ridiculous,
     Micky is dwarfed by comparison. Gorgeous George takes a
     swipe: it was an .impressive punch, but Micky is a quick littl
     bastard and sidesteps. Micky does nothing to retaliate; his
     hands are still by his,side.







                                                   (CONTINUED)





20   CONTINUED:




     Gorgeous George lunges out and grabs Micky by the throat and
     groin, picks him up like a sack of spuds and throws him
     against the car door. All eyes are on Micky for a second or
     two, then he rises and appears little bothered by this, he
     gets up brushes himself off and starts to pace again, hardly
     even looking at the big man.

                          GORGEOUS GEORGE

              You want to stay down my friend, I
              promise you, you want to stay down.
     Micky ignores this and continues to pace, the big fella grabs
     him and puts him in a headlock and charges him into the stable
     door. There is a terrible noise.




                          GORGEOUS GEORGE (CONT'D)

              Now you fucking stay down boy or you
              won't be coming up next time.
     It appears as though this is going to get messy and any humour
     that might have been around has now evaporated. Micky raises
     his head there is still no damage to speak of. All of a
     sudden he starts jumping up and down like he's warming up,
     throwing a few shadow punches, taking off his shirt. This
     reveals a heavily tattooed and scarred torso, and underneath
     these embellishments is a physique that warrants some respect.

                          GORGEOUS GEORGE (CONT'D)

              This is sick. I am outta here.

                          MICKY -

              You're not going anywhere my friend.
              You stay until the job is done.
     Micky starts pacing, and throwing out a couple of shadow
     punches with his back to Gorgeous George, he still hasn't
     really acknowledged his opponent. Gorgeous George moves in
     for the coup de grace, Micky spins on his feet and catches
     the big man under the jaw.

     CUT TO BLACK

     FADE IN: We see Gorgeous George lying on the floor with a
     head the size of a water melon. There is blood streaming
     out of every orifice in his head - he's in.big trouble. We
     are in slow motion;- there's a lot of activity going on around
     the body on the floor, their mouths are open but we can't
     hear what they are saying, all we can hear is the voice over
     given by Tommy.

               will pop me like a hot sausage if
               George doesn't wake up. Why do they
               want to go to the trouble of
               explaining why a man died in a
               campsite? These people don't exist
               in society, you can't find them,
               they live under their own laws and
               ignore everybody else's. I am scared,
               I am really fuckin scared.




21   INT. AMUSEMENT ARCADE 1 -- DAY

     We see Turkish with a somewhat serious expression on his
     face he has his customary pint of milk on one side, he takes
     a sip and "ohhhs" and "arrrs" for a while.

                          .TURKISH

               So you're telling me he would have
               run you through if Gorgeous hadn't
               woken up?

                           TOMMY

               No, his Mum stopped it. If his Mum
               hadn't turned up, well, I ' d be pikey
               fuckin sausages.

                           TURKISH

               What were you thinking of? Why the
               fuck did you put Gorgeous George
               into a bare knuckle boxing match two
               days before he had to fight the
               Bomber?

                           TOMMY

               He was half his size.
     He pantomimes a man that would reach his navel

                           TOMMY (CONT'D)

               I didn't expect him to get hurt.

                           TURKISH

               You put the man into a bare knuckle
               boxing match.
     He raises his voice

              Tell me the correlation between a

     Pause there is no correlation as Tommy knows.

              How are we going to explain to Brick

                          TOMMY

              We replace the fighter.

                          TURKISH

              Oh what, and hope he doesn't notice?
              And who the fuck are we going to
              replace him with?

                          TOMMY

              John "The Gun?" Or "Mad Fist" Willy?

                          TURKISH

              You're not exactly Mr Current Affairs,
              are you Tommy? Mad Fist went mad,
              and the "Gun" shot himself.

                          TOMMY

              What about Clam Hand Tony?

                          TURKISH

              Got his fingers caught in the till.
              He's no good to anyone.

              He wants cash so he's coming back
              after he has been to a fight.
     There is a serious expression of alarm on Hands's face - the
     camera crashes in.

                          HANDS

              What do you mean a fight, you mean a

               Franky is good at buying stones Doug
               but he's a fuckin liability when it
               comes to gambling. That has cost

25   EXT. AIRPLANE --




     We see the undercarriage of Concorde taking off.

26   INT. BRICK TOP'S PUB --




     Tommy and Turkish walk into a pub and approach the BARMAN.
     They reach the bar.    .            .

                             TURKISH

                 We are here to see Brick Top.
     The barman looks them up and down a bit.      He's not doing
     anything.

                             BARMAN

                 I am very busy at the moment.

                             TURKISH                           ·

                 I am not asking you to break sweat,
               . I am asking you to call Brick Top.

                 Who?

                              TURKISH

                 Brick Top.

                 Well make a call and see if someone
                 else has. Say it's Turkish.
     The barman looks bothered by the fact he has to move but
     wanders off. Turkish looks at the pool table.

                  that pool table?
     They both give the table an eyeball.




                              TOMMY

                  What, potted more balls than any
                  other player? What else can you do

                  Quite a fuckin lot if you nail 'em
                  to it.



     TWO HEAVY LOOKING FELLAS appear out of the woodwork.

                              HEAVY FELLA

                  Yup.   -

                               HEAVY FELLA

                  Follow me.
     The heavy fella opens up the bar and beckons Turkish and
     Tommy through. They go through another door and the corridor
     turns into a mass of dogs barking, snarling 'and whining in
     cages. The mood is sinister..they reach another door, they
     open up and we are introduced to a dog fight. A load of
     HEAVY GEEZERS are commenting on the performance of the dogs,
     one dog is being carried out by a single leg, it's covered
     in blood. Another dog is left in the ring, it too is covered
     in blood but it's survived.

                               TURKISH

                  They can charm the paint off walls
                  these fellas.

27   INT. BACK OF PUB - DOG FIGHT -- NIGHT

     A circle of blunt faces are exchanging money with one another
     A few faces turn round to examine Tommy and Turkish, they
     frown slightly but carry on about their business once they
     see they are accompanied by the muscle.
     The heavy walks over to Brick Top. The heavy taps him on
     the shoulder and whispers. He acknowledges, and gives his
     drink to the heavy. He walks over. There is a cage next to
     Brick Top which has a pit bull in, and Brick Top who is
     carrying a cane pokes it through the cage doors. The dog
     snarls back.

               Shits itself when you put it in the

               We don'c have a Gorgeous anymore.
     Brick Top turns round and indicates that he would like the
     noise around him to drop. It does marginally.

                           BRICK TOP

               You're going to have to repeat that.

                           TURKISH

               We have lost Gorgeous George.
     Brick Top turns round again at the already subdued crowd, he
     doesn't raise his voice but the crowd reacts.

                               BRICK TOP

                  I said keep the noise down.. . .
     A tangible silence between the men reflects Brick Top's
     authority.

                  Well, where did you lose him? He

                We are changing the fighter.
     Brick Top wasn't expecting anything out of Tommy.




                            BRICK TOP

                Oh fuck me your lady friend has got
                a voice. And who might you be
                changing him to, sweetheart?

                            TURKISH

                You won't know him.
     Pause: a look of you're kidding comes over his face.




                            BRICK TOP

                Are you taking the piss?

                            TURKISH

                No, there was an accident.

                            BRICK TOP

                I'll show you a fuckin accident.

                            TURKISH

                You've still got your fight.

                            BRICK TOP

                No, I lose all bets at the bookies.
                You can't change fighters at the
                last minute, so no, I don't have my
                fight do I, you fuckin prat!

                            TOMMY

                You could take bets at the fight.

                            BRICK TOP

                Put a lead on her Turkish,     Before
                she gets bitten.
     Pause

                Make sure your man goes down in the

     Vin is playing with the dog in the back.

               I am not happy about that dog Vin,
               you can't bring a dog on a job.

                           VINNY

               You can't leave him on his own, not
               to begin with, he gets homesick.

                           SOL

               Homesick, for fucks sake.

                           VINNY

               He does. If he gets the chance he
               runs back to the gypsies' campsite.

                           SOL

               Ohh shut up, how can he find it?

               I don't know Sol, I am not a dog.
               Ask him. It' s like he's got a fuckin
               homing beacon. Give him the chance
               and he's off.

                           SOL

               You're going soft Vin? Here pass me
               a sandwich.
     Vin throws a sandwich to Sol but the dog catches it whilst
     i t ' s in flight and swallows it in one gulp.

               Jessssus, he didn't even chew it.
     The car has stopped.

               What have you stopped here for?

                  It's too tight.

               What are you talking about, tight?
               You could land a jumbo fuckin jet in
               there.

                  Leave him alone, he's a natural.
     Tyrone gets a little over-excited with the accelerator and
     reverses with a crashing sound into the rear of the van behin

       Tyrone makes to move the van forward again.

                  Well don't move it now, otherwise
                  people will see the damage. What

                  It was at a funny angle.
      Vin is confused as to this last statement.

                              VINNY

                  Funny angle? It was behind you
                  Tyrone, whenever you reverse things
                  come from behind you. I am not happy
                  Sol.

                              VINNY (CONT'D)

                  Give him something to shut him up.



       Sol throws a plastic squeaky dog ball that was in the front.
       The dog grabs in and swallows it in one gulp. The brothers
       look on in shock.

                              SOL

                  He can't swallow a whole ball.

                              TYRONE

                  He swallowed it.
       The dog looks up having completed the task. Vin who looks
       quite alarmed holds the dog by the ribs and squeezes, there
       is a squeak.




29   EXT. AIRPORT. --

     Doug and Alex are waiting to pick- up Hands.

                           DOUG

               Did you get Hands that car?

                           ALEX

               I got him one like it.
     Doug is in shock.

               What do you mean one like it?

                           ALEX

               I got him the Volante.

                           DOUG

               What did I say? What exactly did I
               say?

                           ALEX

               You said get him the Vantage.

                           DOUG

               That's right, I clearly said get him
               the Vantage. So why did you get the
               Volante?                                      ;

                           ALEX

               Because they look the same.

                           DOUG

               The Septuagint scholars mistranslated
               the Hebrew word for "young woman" in
               to the Greek word for "virgin",
               because they thought they looked the
               same, coming up with the prophecy
               "behold a virgin shall conceive and
               bear a son". But there is a world
               of difference between a virgin and a
               young woman like there is between a
               Volante and a fuckin Vantage.
     '.Pause: she thinks about this.

                           ALEX

               Are you saying that the fact that
               your cousin Hands is driving a Valiant
               instead of a Vantage is a profound a
               mistake as a whole religion?

                           DOUG

               Yes I fuckin am!

30   EXT. AIRPORT -- DAY




     Hands and his sidekick Rosebud are coming out of the sliding
     glass doors towards Doug who's now standing by the car with
     his arms crossed. Hands is quite clearly looking for a car.

                               DOUG

                   How about a hug for your old cousin

31   EXT. BOOKIES

     The black guys are sitting in the car still.         The occasional
     squeak comes from the dog.

     They get out of the van and go up to the bookies, leaving
     Tyrone in the van. There's a double set of glass doors.
     Sol pushes them open, and Vinny walks in first, while Sol
     hangs back with the shotgun.

32   INT. BOOKIES -- DAY

     Inside is the MAN with the case, busy filling in a slip, and
     TWO CLERKS behind the betting counter. Vinny doesn't mince
     around and goes straight to the counter, where the HEAD CLERK
     PAULINE, comes up to help.

                              PAULINE

                  It. belongs to me now.
     Vinny then leans over the counter to get menacing.              Pauline
     looks more than a little concerned

                              VINNY (CONT'D)

                  If you know what's good for...
     He is cut short, as Pauline triggers a button under the
     counter and a security screen comes flying up at a very rapid
     rate of knots protecting all the counters. This has the
     unfortunate consequence of taking Vinny with it. Poor Vin
     is shot straight to the ceiling, all we can see is half a
     body and his desperately searching for ground legs. Needless
     to say this leaves Sol in a bit of a bewildered state. He's
     looking the wrong way at the critical moment and is left
     wondering what happened, not having seen Vince impaled on
     the ceiling. Sol extracts the enormous shotgun.




                           SOL

              Vi nce ? Vince??
     He spins round looking for his colleague. A muffled noise
     tells him to look up.     ,

              the fuck are you doing up there?
     A few groans emanate from the other side of the counter.
     Sol panics some more, and decides that emergency action is
     called for.                               .

                              SOL (CONT'D)

     Sol raises the gun and fires into the side .of- the wall.
     There's an enormous explosion and a clear hole is made in
     the side of the wall. The powerful kick from the gun also
     makes Sol momentarily airborne.




33   EXT. BLACK GUYS' VAN -- DAY




     We see Tyrone grimace at the sound of the shotgun.

34   INT. BOOKIES -- DAY




     Sol pulls himself together and marches up to the hole in the
     wall that the shot created and pokes the gun through.

                            SOL

                Drop the screen now! You just seen
                what it did to this wall so think
                what it could do to you.
     Pauline knows she has lost this one and looks genuinely
     scared.

                     (to the other clerk)
               . Do it. . . . I said do it.
     The screen comes down with a thud. This means that Vince
     comes down with just as serious a thud. He lets out another
     groan.

                            SOL

                How you doing Vince?
     A weakened voice retorts.

                            VINNY

                How do I look like I am doing you

                lot better if you would stop using
                my name.
     Consoled that his colleague is not dead it's back to business
     for Sol. He raises the gun and pulls his fiercest face.

     There is a pause. Sol knows he's fucked. She points to a

               I am not feeling too funny.
     Sol's temper does have a limit.

               Well I am not feeling too fucking

                  Let me see your hands.
     The man holds his hands up. He has got a perfect set of
     five fingers on both hands. Sol puts his head in his hands.
     Pauline and the other clerk put two bags full of coins on
     the counter. Sol picks them up and frowns, he's not happy
     with a bag full of change. He puts his gun down and starts
     to rifle through the bag. Pauline can see Vinny's pistol on
     the counter, dropped after his encounter with the screen.

                fuckin coins?
     Pauline sees her opportunity and grabs the pistol. Sol .goes
     for it too, but he's beaten to it. Sol ducks, pulling Vince
     with him, Pauline lets out a series of shots in their
     direction, Sol counter blasts over the top of the counter.
     The security screen comes flying back up.

                Get me out of here now Sol.
     Vinny does sound convincingly desperate.

                            SOL

                We're going Vin.
     He grabs the bag of copper coins, grabs Vince and marches
     towards the double'doors. They open the first set and then
     they try to open the second. They push the door nothing
     happens. There is no going back. Sol starts to kick the
     glass door, but it doesn't budge. With panic rising swiftly,
     Sol doesn't fuck around he takes aim with the handgun and
     fires, the bullet shatters the glass but it doesn't break
     through, and the bullet now ricochets off both glass doors
     shattering bullet-proof glass all around them. Vinny's panic
     filled eyes attempt to follow its trajectory. Sol is unaware
     of the ricochet and before Vin has time to warn him, Sol
     fires another bullet. Now he observes the problem and waits
     for the inevitable. The bullet tears through the bag of
     coins, which then empties its contents at Vin's and Sol's
     feet. Eventually the bullet hits poor Vince in the thigh.
     Sol sinks to the floor, he has given up. Amongst the yells
     emanating from Vince we can hear Sol's pathetic and desperate
     whimpering.

                What the fuck are you two doing?
     They stumble out into the street. Vinny is in big trouble.
     They throw him into the van. Just as Sol gets into the back,
     we hear kicking noises on metal from the van behind. Tyrone
     pulls out. And the rear doors of the van behind them fly
     open. Franky Four Fingers appears from the back of this ·
     van. He was locked in due to the fact that the black guys'
     van was blocking his exit.

     Tyrone takes an interest in the man from the van (ie Franky)
     seeing that he's carrying a case and the case is connected
     to his wrist.

     28 - as Tyrone parks the van )
     We cut back to Frankie Four Fingers getting out of his van.
     He takes a quick look around and enters the back of his van.
     There he raises the spare tire and picks up his gun, he
     examines it and places it in his trouser front. He then
     turns to exit. At which point there is a loud smash and
     Franky is knocked backwards (as Tyrone hits his van).

     WE CUT TO BLACK.                  '


     WE FADE UP

     (Time-wise, we're now at the end of scene 34)
     Frankie wakes up. He has a trickle of blood dripping down
     the back of his neck, he looks at his watch and panics. He
     kicks the doors a couple of times - nothing happens, but on
     the third kick the doors spring open. Franky brushes himself
     off and makes his way to the bookies.

39   EXT. STREET OUTSIDE BOOKIES --DAY




     We cut to Tyrone. Tyrone clocks the case attached to Franky'
     wrist. Gets out and slams the end of the gun across Franky
     Four Fingers' head. He falls to the ground. Tyrone tries
     to take the case off him but i t ' s handcuffed to his wrist.
     So he has little choice but to pick him up and throw him in
     to the back of the car with the other two.

     Franky's hand   up on a desk and are fiddling with the handcuff,
     whatever they   are trying to break in with snaps off. Vinny
     is frustrated   and illustrates his dissatisfaction.

     Tyrone goes for the big gun and Franky pulls the trigger.
     Nothing happens other than a big click, there is silence for
     a long second and the black guys open their tightly shut
     eyes.                                                      :

     He holds up the diamond. Boris1 eyes follow him as he walks
     back into the room where Franky is and puts the diamond back
     into the case while he's talking and changes the combination.

               rights keep the whole fuckin stone.
     Boris grimaces and pulls out a gun from god knows where, and
     within a second shoots poor Franky in the face. Franky's
     body disappears off the stool that he was sitting on. The
     black guys are stunned into silence.

                           BORIS

               who I am. Now open the case and
               give me.the stone.

     just changed gear and they weren't expecting that.

               Who's next? You have the ten grand
               now give me the stone.

     worryingly close to Sol's head.

     Boris appears little bothered by this and whips out a four
     foot machete that he was concealing about his person. He
     pulls the case towards him and brings the machete down with
     full force. We can tell by the expression on Tyrone's face
     that it must have been some part of Franky's anatomy.
     Pointing to the ground:

     He points to Franky. While he is saying this he bends down
     and picks up the case from the floor and wraps the severed
     arm in newspaper. He then walks out of the shop casual as
     you like.

     Turkish pulls up outside his arcade and has a look around:

     Turkish has another look around the back

     his way to the safe under the floor. He decides to put the
     kettle on, does so, and his attention is caught by something,
     he looks at the cups on the side and sees that one is waiting
     to be made. He stands back and looks at the cupboards he
     sees that they are all open. Then he sees that the kettle
     is already boiled.

     let it ring for a while.

47   EXT. PORTACABIN




     The film stock is 1970s, and things seem more dated. This
     is confirmed by the dress of our man TONY. Tony is standing
     outside a scrap metal yard and he is kicking the door of a
     portacabin.                                             ..

                              TONY

                  Open up Charlie.

                             CHARLIE

                  Fuck off. The only thing I'11 open
                  up is you.

                                TONY

                  could have been one of the other
                  lads, and then think how much trouble
                  you' d be in.

                              CHARLIE

                  You come through that door and you'll
                  be going out prostrate.

                              TONY

                  It doesn't belong to you Charlie.
     He kicks open the door. CHARLIE is standing behind his desk
     holding a pistol directly at Tony. On the table is a bag of
     what we must believe is coke, it's open, and Charlie has it
     all over his nose.                     .

                              TONY (CONT'D)

                  off with other people's gear. How
                  much you put up your nose?
     Charlie opens up, he fires four shots straight into Tony who
     buckles and falls to the floor. Tony seems only shaken and
     he holds his hands out to inspect them, he's bleeding.

                              TONY (CONT'D)

                  Oh you silly cunt.
     Tony stands and walks towards Charlie. Charlie is
     understandably shocked and fires another. It goes straight
     through Tony and we see the blood hit the wall behind.

                              CHARLIE

                  Go down-boy, go down.

47   CONTINUED:

     Tony keeps going for him. Charlie raises the gun and points
     it at Tony's face and fires the last shot. The bullet goes
     straight into his mouth but it went in at an angle and it
     exits his cheek. Tony is standing there with six. bullet
     holes in him and bleeding all over the carpet. As he talks
     blood courses its way down his front and a strong lisp is
     frustrating the words.

                              TONY

                  Ohh you'f in twouble nowf.



     Tony slowly extracts a short sword from behind him. Fear
     has set into Charlie's face and has rendered him useless.

                  Ok so let's get hold of him.

                              DOUG

                  Firstly you gotta understand he's a
                  little strange.                                       .

                           HANDS

              .He could swing from trees wearing
               rubber dresses as far as I am
               concerned, all as I care about is
               whether he can find Franky.

                                                                             4


49   INT. CARAVAN CAMP SITE --DAY




     Turkish and Tommy pull up outside the pikey camp.             Micky's
     Mum is sitting in her chair surrounded by kids.

                              MUM

                  They're very nice Tommy.       Thank you.
     Tommy has produced a bunch of flowers from somewhere.              Turkish
     finds this a great surprise.

                              TURKISH

                  Where did they come from? You're a
                  snake in the grass Tommy.

                              MUM

                  You looking for Micky?

                              TURKISH

                  Hare coursing. The gypsies can't
                  get enough of it.

                              TOMMY

                  What the fuck's a hare?

                  Why don't they call em big rabbits
                  then?

                              TURKISH

                  Because they call em hares.
     Tommy shrugs.

                  So what's coursing?

                              TURKISH

                  They set two lurchers, they are dogs
                  before you ask, on a hare, that's
                  the big rabbit. And the hare has to
                  outrun the dogs.

                              TOMMY

                  What happens if he doesn't?

51   EXT. SEEDY STREET

     Errol is curb crawling down a particularly seedy street in a
     car with John. They come to a halt, at the feet of some
     touter.

                              ERROL

                  Excuse me mate, d'ya know Mullet?
     The man looks a little 'further down the street. Errol follow
     his eyes, squints and seems to focus on something.

                                ERROL (CONT'D)

                  Cheers pal.
     Errol puts on the gas a little-, the car surges forward and
     slows at the feet of Mullet - seedy looking character with
     big ears and a moody haircut, who smokes fat cheap cigars
     and wears his top shirt button fastened.

                              MULLET

                  Errol, John. Alright chaps?     How's
                  the gov'nor?

                  Very well Mullet, I am sure he'll be
                  flattered you inquired.

                  what have you got for us about the
                  gov'nor's bookies?

                              MULLET

                  I did find something out as it
                  happens, I knew a driver who was
                  grafting that day.

     He pulls out a catalogue on fancy caravans and points to the
     picture of the Rolls Royce of caravans.

                  The fight is twice the size. And my
                  mum still needs a new caravan.




                              TURKISH

                  Micky you are lucky we aren't worm
                  food after your performance, I think
                  buying a tart's mobile palace is a
                  little fuckin rich.



     There is a pause while Micky frowns.       Turkish looks a little
     sheepish.

               me a favour?

               bet. If I win I get the caravan, if
               I lose I'l l do the fight for free.
     Turkish considers this, uneasily.       He looks at the dogs they
     look keen and fit.

                  Oh no Tommy I wasn't saying you can't
                  shoot, I know you can't shoot. What
                  I was saying is that six pound piece
                  of shit stuck in your trousers there
                  would do more damage if you fed it
                  to em.

                  lifting a body in one piece.
                  Apparently the best thing to do is
                  cut the corpse up into six pieces
                  and pile it all together.

              through a body that weighs two hundred
              pounds in about eight minutes that
              means that a single pig can consume

                Jesus Tone you know how it is.
     Btt turns to Hands.

                            BTT

                Give us your wallet Hands.
     Hands makes eyes and digs into his back pocket and produces
     his wallet. BTT takes out some notes and proffers them to
     Mullet, Mullet nervously reaches forward. As quick as you
     like Btt has Mullet by the collar and pulls Mullet into the
     car. He then raises the electric window on Mullet's throat
     until it has fastened Mullet to the roof of the vehicle.




                             BTT (CONT'D)

     Mullet has already gone pink.

                You can take as long as you like
                Mullet.
     Btt starts to pull away so Mullet has to keep walking with
     him.

                            MULLET

                Fuckin hell what are you doing?

                            BTT

                I am driving down the street with
                your head stuck in my window. What
                do you think I am doing you penis?
     He does the window up a bit tighter. And grabs him by the
     nose. He pulls a face when he smells his breath.

                            BTT (CONT'D)

                You been using dog shit tooth paste

                  a job for a pair of brothers who
                  have a pawn shop in Smith Street.

                  see what I can do to you.
     He puts his foot down and Mullet loses his footing, and is
     dragged along.                                      '.

     He points to Mullet. BTT pulls an, 'oh yes I forgot about
     him1 face. He doesn't even look at Mullet. He lowers the
     window, and Mullet falls by the way, in god knows what
     condition.

     The music continues, and we have a montage of the black guys
     dealing with Bullet Tooth Tony and Hands as they arrive at
     the pawn shop. We see the corpse, we see Hands get irate
     and it looks like it's going to be the end of the black fellas
     again. The black guys try to whip out the big gun but Tony
     disarms them and takes the gun off them. The music ends
     along with the scene when Sol breaks.

     Tommy and Turkish are looking on to the burned out caravan. .
     They are in shock. There is a whole gathering of dodgy,
     angry looking pikies standing around, giving Turkish and
     Tommy some bad looks.

     to the side and hits a lamp post. They crash and the boot

      Tony starts to build himself a complicated looking weapon
      under the table, unseen by the black guys. He takes bits

      know it. They start to reverse. BTT lets the odd chicken
      cluck out the corner of his mouth, Vinny misses his step and

       still drying his hands, they can see that he's carrying a

       opportunity to duck. Hands dives for cover too and drops
       the bag. A continuation of bullets comes flying through the

      opened and a man brings out Lincoln. Lincoln is in bad shape

                you've heard one or two of those
                stories. For example, did you hear
                about the three black fellas that
                did a very bad thing, however they
                made some effort to redeem that very
                bad thing, so the governor saw fit
                not to kill em. He thought it would
                be a more advantageous concept to
                let them kill each other and let the
                survivor live to tell the tale.
                That way everybody wins, well, all
                except the two that died of course.
      We look at the table where we see three large kitchen knives
      sitting provocatively. Tyrone rushes for one of the blades
      grabs it and runs at Vin, Vin sidesteps and Tyrone keeps
      running straight into the arms of Errol who raises his gun
      at the last moment. Tyrone slides the blade into Errol 's
      ribs and Errol fires a shot straight at Tyrone. The bullet
      passes through Tyrone and hits John in the throat . Vin,
      Lincoln and Sol are left wondering what the fuck has just
      happened .

                If they weren't sniffing the dust
                they where flicking the ash. And
                never trust who puts anything other
                than a finger up his nose.
      KEN, another of Brick Top's men, appears from somewhere and
      approaches Tony with another heavy, SEAN.

                              KEN

                Follow me.
      They do and end up in a corridor. The door .shuts behind
      them and the door in front hasn't yet opened. Ken turns
      around and faces Tony.

                              KEN (CONT'D)

                Did you know that it was my cousin
                Lorrie you stabbed?
      There is a pause.    The situation is volatile.

                             BTT

                Yes I know I stabbed a man called
                Lorrie, but no I didn't know he was
                related to a tub a shit.
      Ken knows it's on.

                             KEN

                Shut that door Sean.

                             BTT

                Lock that fuckin door Sean.
      BTT takes a step forward and puts his hand, into the back of
      his trousers. He starts to growl.

                              BTT (CONT'D)

                 You're a big man, but I don't care
                 if you're ten foot fuckin tall, you
                 still got eight pints of blood and
                you'll bleed like any bastard. And
              . when.I drop .ya, and I will fuckin
                drop ya, I'll open you up like a
                packet of crisps.



      Pause to take in what has just been said then he continues.

                              BTT (CONT'D)

                You're a bully Ken, but remember, I
                am a bigger bully.

      The door opens and they are interrupted by another HEAVY.

                Ha, Ken what' s going on? Bring em
                through. The governor wants to see

      Ken is relieved by the interruption, and he leads the way
      with a truculent "you're lucky" stare. They enter Brick
      Top's office.

                we paid for it. So I am going to
                have a drink and let you two discuss
                what you have to discuss.
      Btt walks to the bar.   Ken is sitting there with Sean.

                Alright big man, I hope you aren't
                bitter about your cousin Lorrie.
      If you listen carefully, you will hear a slight zip of flies
      being undone.

                 to me Tony you're a dead fuckin...
      Brick top frowns at Ken, and Ken shuts up quickly.

                             BRICK TOP

                 What did you do to upset Ken, Tony?
      Tony shrugs

                 He's pissed in my fuckin pocket,

      Ken shows off a wet-sided jacket and a damp set of trousers.

                             BRICK TOP

                 Do shut up Ken.   That was a bit
                 naughty Tony.
      Tony shrugs. Brick Top puts his hands in to his pocket and
      withdraws the stone. We cut to Hand's expression.

                             HANDS

                 Well come on, let's have a look.
      Brick Top passes the stone to Hands. All goes quiet while
      everybody focuses on the stone. Hands lifts it up to his
      eye.

                             HANDS (CONT'D)

                 What are you playing at? -
      He drops the stone: it smashes on the ground.

117 ' INT. VAN -- NIGHT

      We fade out of black to Micky's pov. Thisis shot in slow
      motion. Micky opens his eyes, in the backof.a large van,
      there is only one faint light that moodilyilluminates his
      tired eyes.

                            TURKISH

                attention to what you are doing.
      Micky just yawns.

               Anderson so don't get too clever, he
               used to be a pro. Just keep moving

               go when push has come to shove.

118   INT. WAREHOUSE                                -    '

      A temporary ring has   been erected, four scaffolding posts
      with welded on hoops   make the arena, the ropes that are
      threaded through the   hoops are industrial nylon and free of
      padding. Around the    ropes it's starting to fill. Brick Top
      approaches Salt Pete   and Jack 'the all seeing eye'.

                            SALT, PETER

                I hope we gonna get a better show

119   INT. BACK OF WAREHOUSE




      Brick Top is standing in front of Micky whose eyes are still
      semi open.

                            BRICK TOP

                What's wrong with you? You stoned?
                Is he fuckin stoned?

                He's like that before a fight.
      He turns his attention to Micky.

                           BRICK TOP

               Now you know when you're going down?

                              TURKISH

               Of course he knows when he's going
               down.

                           KEN

               Hey fuck face, who's speaking to
               you? He asked him didn't he?

               Fuck face? I like that, I ' l l have
               to use that one next time -I want to

               The fourth... or was it the fifth..

                           BRICK TOP

               There's a campsite full of pikies
               that might not think you're so fuckin
               funny when they 'are putting the flames
               out on their children's backs.
      Cut to a shot of Brick Top's boys lighting a cigarette in
      the car outside the pikies.




120   INT. WAREHOUSE

      Micky appears from a small door at the back of the warehouse.
      He approaches the ring accompanied with shouts of
      encouragement and counter shouts. He's wearing a pair of
      semi cut tracksuit bottoms and a t-shirt with grease marks
      down the front. Turkish walks behind him, Micky still looks
      bored. He climbs into the ring. Then from the same door as
      the one through Micky came out walks a larger character with
      a nose that appears to have seen countless rounds with a
      frying pan: HORACE 'GOOD NIGHT1 ANDERSON.

                            THE REFF

                Alright lads no eye gouging no biting.
                Do your worst. Back to your corners.



      We drift again into Micky's pov, his world is becoming more
      and more surreal. He can faintly hear Turkish whispering
      words to him, but he's not really listening. A bell comes
      from somewhere, and Micky instinctively walks to the center
      of the ring. "Good night" is already there, they pace one
      another for a second or two, Micky avoids a punch or two and
      then he takes a hard one and he knows it, we flash to white,
      Micky's in trouble: he lets one of his missiles go and BANG
      it shakes "good night" to his core, all goes quiet. We go
      to super slow motion: his knees buckle and "good night" is
      in trouble. Micky maintains a frown as he watches his
      opponent's knees threaten to betray him. The crowd tries to
      digest what is happening. After a period of silence reality
      dawns. Brick Top mouths the words in silence."Don1t go down
      you fucker". The crowd wants Micky to finish the job. But
      common sense reins back the coup de grace. "Good night"
      eventually regains control of his legs and stumbles forward,
      after a few sleepy punches he starts to provide a serious
      onslaught.




                            TURKISH

                I don't like the look of this Tommy,
                bring the van up to the back door.
      This goes on for two rounds (which is montage down to a few
      seconds). We go in the mind of poor Micky. We break the
      music just as it's starting to look dangerous... The bell
      goes and Micky walks to the wrong corner. Turkish pulls him
      back to his corner.

                            TURKISH (CONT'D)

               They are on ya. You got to hurt him
               Micky. Otherwise we are
               rumbled.... you hear me Micky? Do
               -something, it looks like it' s rigged.
      Micky goes out again his hands are low, BANG there is a flash
      of white as Micky goes down in the dirt. Dust rises from
      where he fell. He gets up quickly, his hands are still low,
      BANG he goes down again, in no time he's up.




                                              (CONTINUED)





120   CONTINUED:    -

      BANG: he hits the ground again and this time when he hits
      the deck, he penetrates the dust covered floor, like i t ' s
      made out of water. He falls through the water like he's
      sinking; his eyes are open and he can't breathe, he continues
      to fall, but he's unpanicked (he is now Micky 1). When Micky
      1 looks up he can see himself in the corner of the ring takin
      kidney punches from Good Night, he's winded and only semi-
      conscious (this is Micky 2). Micky 1 makes the effort to
      swim up and tries to penetrate the floor but he's stuck he
      can't get through. Micky 2 takes more punishment in the
      ring, as Micky 1 ' s hand continues to try to break the
      underside of the floor but it stretches like rubber and forces
      Micky 1 down again. Micky 1 looks up again and sees how
      much trouble Micky 2 ' s in the ring. Micky 1 is panicking
      now, he's running out of oxygen and Micky 2's being beaten,
      Micky 1 starts -to sink again but now flames tickle the bottom
      of his feet he looks up. and sees Micky 2 being smashed to
      hell, his body eventually collapses and Micky 2 falls through
      the floor. And as the latter falls through, Micky 1 manages
      to rise from the depths and his punch manages to perforate
      the surface. The punch continues its trajectory and has the
      power to fell a red blooded rhino.... it catches "Good Night"
      on the jaw and it's good night for "Good Night" it's unlikely
      that he'll awake in the next hour. Dear oh dear everybody
      is in trouble.



      Again we cut to the reactions of the relevant parties.

                               TURKISH (CONT'D)

                   Tommy get the van.




                               TOMMY

                   I have it, it's waiting.
      Turkish jumps into the ring and grabs Micky.

                               TURKISH

                   We are off Micky, hold tight, and
                   move quickly. ,
      Turkish pulls Micky away. It's not as hard as it might be
      trying to get out, because the crowd seems to have found its
      own disputes, chairs start to fly. Brick Top's boys are
      frustrated in the mayhem. Brick Top calmly dials into his
      mobile telephone. It rings.

                                                                     1

      Darren picks up the phone.

                                DAREN      .

                   If you would you like to speak to
                   your friends, you'll have to speak a
                   little -louder.

121   CONTINUED:

      We pull back to see four slumped heads in the car and blood
      staining the windscreen. Brick Top calmly puts the phone
      down.

                               BRICK TOP

                   Right lets get outta here.
      Brick Top is looking every which way and trying to get out
      of there, accompanied by Ken.

                               BRICK TOP (CONT.'D)

                   Where's the car Ken?




                                  KEN

                   I t ' s coming now.

                               BRICK TOP

                   We are outta here.
      They come out of a side entrance, their car pulls round the
      corner and screeches to a halt. Brick Top opens the door as
      he is about to get in, he's eyes widen to the size of saucers
      as FOUR MEN (who we recognize from the wake) are sitting in
      the place of his driver. They both have sawed-off shotguns
      and empty four barrels into the chest of Brick Top and Ken.
      The car spins away, leaving their twitching bodies on the
      dirt.

                                                                       :


122   INT. BAD BOY LINCOLN'S HOUSE                                 .




      Hands, Doug and Bullet Tooth have Vin, Sol and Bad Boy Lincol
      in tow. They look at the front room of Lincoln's house.

                               HANDS

                   Very nice Lincoln.

                               BTT

                   Veeeery nice Lincoln.

                   Well where is it?

                                VINNY

                   Next door.
      They open the door.

123   INT. BAD BOY LINCOLN'S SITTING ROOM.




      This room is a complete mess. All the colony leather has
      been chewed up beyond recognition. They all grimace at the
      smell. The dog comes running up

                   Look what your dog's done to my
                   leather.

                                BTT

                   It's a bit funky in here.
      BTT opens a window.       The dog looks extremely relieved to see
      someone.

                                    HANDS

                   You keep a good house Lincoln.      So
                   where's this stone?

                                VINNY

                   It was over there.
      He points to a pile of chewed up cushions.

                                    HANDS

                   Where?

                               VINNY

                   We left it in a box over there...
                   somewhere.
      He walks over and finds the remains of the box.

                                    VINNY (CONT'D)

                   I t ' s empty.

                   there. It must be in the dog.
      All eyes focus on the dog.

                  What do you mean have a look in the
                  dog?

                               HANDS

                  I mean open him up..
      Tony is not sure about this.

                               BTT

                  I t ' s not a fuckin tin of baked beans,
                  what do you mean open him up?

                  I mean open him up.
      Hands does a movement that represents a knife across the
      throat.

                             BTT

                 That's a bit strong isn't it?

                             HANDS

                 You wouldn't have a problem if it
                 was a person.

                               BTT

                 But it's not, it's a dog and I have
                 never done a dog.

                             HANDS

                 My heart bleeds.
      There is another pause

                            ,BTT

                 What dp I do?

                              HANDS

                  Let me take a wild and reckless guess.
                  Stick a knife in his guts and see if
                  it's got a diamond in there? I'll
                  hold it still and'you open it up.
      Tony looks positively unsure and rocks his head from side to
      side.

                              BTT

                  Fuckin hell, alright then.

                  You can't do that.

                 Well do it to you as well if it makes
                 you feel any better.
      Cut to Tony having some problems trying to get hold of the
      awkward dog. The dog starts to squeak. Tony passes the
      blade to Hands.

                                BTT

                 I t ' s squeaking.

                               HANDS

                 What, you've never heard a dog squeak
                 before?... Hold him still.
      The dog isn't sure about this either.      Vin is in a panic and
      suddenly.

                            VINNY

                 Stop! I can see it.   I can see the
                 stone.
      Hands at the point of entry stops. Vinny hops over to the
      stone and picks it up. Tony lets the dog stand but keeps a
      grip oh the collar. The dog is relieved to be semi-liberated.
      Hands is still on his knees armed with an incredulous stare.

                             HANDS

                 Well let's see it.
      Vinny holds it up. There's a sense of relief. He then throws
      the stone, it cuts through the air. And the dog seeing
      .another projectile runs to intercept it. There's a pause
      while all now focus again on the dog. This is digested
      literally and mentally. The dog recognizes all the attention
      it's receiving. And goes through the motions of swallowing
      it. Hands attempts an approach. The dog understandably
      feels uncomfortable about the advancing vanguard and decides
      emergency action is needed, and seeing the open window
      launches itself out of it.

                   You gonna have to come up with
                   something.
      Just then they see some caravans in the distance.

                   There they are.

126   INT. NEW CARAVAN CAMP SITE

      All the caravans are fastened to the back of cars. Vinny,
      Sol, BTT and Hands are standing in front of Micky.

                             MICKY

                 Well he's didn't come back to us.

                               VINNY

                   But he always came back.

                             MICKY

                 Well you might have noticed that we
                 have moved, you should have fed him
                 more, a dog will never leave you if
                 you feed it properly. It was a good
                 dog, he had a little flatulence
                 problem but was a good dog.

                               HANDS

                   Are you sure he's not here?

      Vinny, Sol, BTT and Hands descend the steps, they look like
      children with their toys taken away.

                 You better find me that dog, skinny
                 Vinny.



      One of Micky's kids is on the bottom of the caravan steps as
      the brothers walk by.

      The kid turns away and goes back to squeezing a toy.   All
      four of the chaps stop in their tracks.
      Cut to shot of squeaky toy. We have seen this toy before.
      Cut to freeze frame of Sol, Vin, BTT and Hands stopped dead
      in their .tracks. They haven't turned to look over their
      shoulders yet, but their eyes are turning to look.
