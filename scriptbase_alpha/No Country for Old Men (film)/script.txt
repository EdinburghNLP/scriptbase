               FADE IN:

               EXT. MOUNTAINS - NIGHT

               Snow is falling in a gusting wind. The voice of an old man: 

                                     VOICE OVER
                         I was sheriff of this county when I 
                         was twenty-five. Hard to believe. 
                         Grandfather was a lawman. Father 
                         too. Me and him was sheriff at the 
                         same time, him in Plano and me here. 
                         I think he was pretty proud of that. 
                         I know I was.

               EXT. WEST TEXAS LANDSCAPE - DAWN/DAY

               We dissolve to another West Texas landscape. Sun is rising.

                                     VOICE OVER
                         Some of the old-time sheriffs never 
                         even wore a gun. A lot of folks find 
                         that hard to believe. Jim Scarborough 
                         never carried one. That's the younger 
                         Jim. Gaston Boykins wouldn't wear 
                         one. Up in Comanche County.

               We dissolve through more landscapes, bringing us to full 
               day. None of them show people or human habitation.

                                     VOICE OVER
                         I always liked to hear about the old-
                         timers. Never missed a chance to do 
                         so. Nigger Hoskins over in Bastrop 
                         County knowed everbody's phone number 
                         off by heart. You can't help but 
                         compare yourself against the old-
                         timers. Can't help but wonder how 
                         they would've operated these times. 
                         There was this boy I sent to the gas 
                         chamber at Huntsville here a while 
                         back. My arrest and my testimony. He 
                         killed a fourteen-year-old girl. 
                         Papers said it was a crime of passion 
                         but he told me there wasn't any 
                         passion to it.

               EXT. WEST TEXAS ROAD - DAY

               The last landscape, hard sunbaked prairie, is surveyed in a 
               long slow pan.

                                     VOICE OVER
                         Told me that he'd been planning to 
                         kill somebody for about as long as 
                         he could remember. Said that if they 
                         turned him out he'd do it again.

               The pan has brought into frame the flashing light bars of a 
               police car stopped on the shoulder. A young sheriff's deputy 
               is opening the rear door on the far side of the car.

                                     VOICE OVER
                         Said he knew he was going to hell. 
                         Be there in about fifteen minutes. I 
                         don't know what to make of that. I 
                         surely don't.

               Close on a pair of hands manacled behind someone's back. A 
               hand enters to take the prisoner by one arm.

                                     VOICE OVER
                         The crime you see now, it's hard to 
                         even take its measure. It's not that 
                         I'm afraid of it.

               Back to the shot over the light bars: the deputy, with a 
               hand on top of the prisoner's head to help him clear the 
               door frame, eases the prisoner into the backseat. All we see 
               of the prisoner is his dark hair disappearing into the car.

                                     VOICE OVER
                         I always knew you had to be willing 
                         to die to even do this job -- not to 
                         be glorious. But I don't want to 
                         push my chips forward and go out and 
                         meet something I don't understand.

               The deputy closes the back door. He opens the front passenger 
               door and reaches down for something-apparently heavy-at his 
               feet.

                                     VOICE OVER
                         You can say it's my job to fight it 
                         but I don't know what it is anymore.

               The deputy swings the heavy object into the front passenger 
               seat. Matching inside the car: it looks like an oxygen tank 
               with a petcock at the top and tubing running off it.

                                     VOICE OVER
                         ...More than that, I don't want to 
                         know. A man would have to put his 
                         soul at hazard.

               The deputy slams the door.

               On the door slam we cut to Texas highway racing under the 
               lens, the landscape flat to the horizon. The siren whoops.

                                     VOICE OVER
                         ...He would have to say, okay, I'll 
                         be part of this world.

               INT. SHERIFF LAMAR'S OFFICE - DAY

               THE DEPUTY

               Seated in the sheriff's office, on the phone. The prisoner 
               stands in the background. Focus is too soft for us to see 
               his features but his posture shows that his arms are still 
               behind his back.

                                     DEPUTY
                         Yessir, just walked in the door. 
                         Sheriff he had some sort of a thing 
                         on him like one of them oxygen tanks 
                         for emphysema or somethin'. And a 
                         hose from it run down his sleeve...

               Behind him we see the prisoner seat himself on the floor 
               without making a sound and scoot his manacled hands out under 
               his legs. Hands in front of him now, he stands.

                                     DEPUTY
                         ...Well you got me, sir. You can see 
                         it when you get in...

               The prisoner approaches. As he nears the deputy's back he 
               grows sharper but begins to crop out of the top of the frame.

                                     DEPUTY
                         ...Yessir I got it covered.

               As the deputy reaches forward to hang up, the prisoner is 
               raising his hands out of frame just behind him. The manacled 
               hands drop back into frame in front of the deputy's throat 
               and jerk back and up. 

               Wider: the prisoner's momentum brings both men crashing 
               backward to the floor, face-up, deputy on top.

               The deputy reaches up to try to get his hands under the 
               strangling chain.

               The prisoner brings pressure. His wrists whiten around the 
               manacles.

               The deputy's legs writhe and stamp. He moves in a clumsy 
               circle, crabbing around the pivot-point of the other man's 
               back arched against the floor.

               The deputy's flailing legs kick over a wastebasket, send 
               spinning the castored chair, slam at the desk.

               Blood creeps around the friction points where the cuffs bite 
               the prisoner's wrists. Blood is being spit by the deputy.

               The prisoner feels with his thumb at the deputy's neck and 
               averts his own face. A yank of the chain ruptures the carotid 
               artery. It jets blood.

               The blood hits the office wall, drumming hollowly.

               INT. SHERIFF LAMAR'S BATHROOM - DAY

               The prisoner walks in, runs the water, and puts his wrists, 
               now freed, under it.

               INT. OFFICE - DAY

               Close on the air tank. One hand, a towel wrapped at the wrist, 
               reaches in to hoist it.

               EXT. ROAD - LATE DAY

               Road rushes under the lens. Point-of-view through a windshield 
               of taillights ahead, the only pair in sight.

               A siren bloop.

               The car pulls over. A four-door Ford sedan.

               The police car pulls over behind.

               The prisoner -- his name is Anton Chigurh -- gets out of the 
               police car and slings the tank over his shoulder. He walks 
               up the road to the man cranking down his window, groping for 
               his wallet.

                                     MAN
                         What's this about? 

                                     CHIGURH
                         Step out of the car please, sir.

               The motorist squints at the man with the strange apparatus. 

                                     MAN
                         Huh? What is...

                                     CHIGURH
                         I need you to step out of the car, 
                         sir.

               The man opens his door and emerges.

                                     MAN
                         Am I...

               Chigurh reaches up to the man's forehead with the end of the 
               tube connected to the air tank.

                                     CHIGURH
                         Would you hold still please, sir.

               A hard pneumatic sound. The man flops back against the car. 
               Blood trickles from a hole in the middle of his forehead. 

               Chigurh waits for the body to slide down the car and crumple, 
               clearing the front door. He opens it and hoists the air tank 
               over into the front seat.

               EXT. ARID PLAIN - DAY

               Seen through an extreme telephoto lens. Heat shimmer rises 
               from the desert floor.

               A pan of the horizon discovers a distant herd of antelope. 
               The animals are grazing.

               Reverse on a man in blue jeans and cowboy boots sitting on 
               his heels, elbows on knees, peering through a pair of 
               binoculars. A heavy-barreled rifle is slung across his back. 
               This is Moss.

               He lowers the binoculars, slowly unslings the rifle and looks 
               through its sight.

               The view through the sight swims for a moment to refind the 
               herd. One animal is staring directly at us, its motion 
               arrested as if it's heard or seen something.

               Close on Moss's eyes, one at the sight, the other closed.

               He mutters:

                                     MOSS
                         Hold still.

               He opens the free eye and rolls his head off the sight to 
               give himself stereo.

               Close on the hatch-marked range dial on the sight. Moss 
               delicately thumbs it.

               He eases the one eye back onto the sight.

               Point-of-view through the sight: Moss adjusts to bring the 
               cross-hairs back down to the staring animal.

               Moss's finger tightens on the trigger.

               Shot: gunbuck swishes the point-of-view upward.

               Moss fights it back down.

               The point-of-view through the sight finds the beast again, 
               still staring at us.

               The sound of the gunshot rings out across the barial.

               Short beat.

               The bullet hits the antelope: not a kill. The animal recoils 
               and runs, packing one leg.

               The other animals are off with it.

                                     MOSS
                         Shit.

               He stands and jacks out the spent casing which jangles against 
               the rocks. He stoops for it and puts it in his shirt pocket.

               EXT. ARID PLAIN - LATER

               Moss is on foot, rifle again slung over his shoulder, 
               binoculars around his neck. He is looking at the ground.

               An intermittent trail of blood.

               Moss's pace is brisk. Distances are long.

               He suddenly stops, staring.

               On the ground is the fresh trail of blood, the glistening 
               drops already dry at the periphery. But this trail is crossed 
               by another trail of blood. Drier.

               Moss looks one way along this older trail:

               His point-of-view: flatlands. Scrub. No movement.

               He looks the other way.

               A distant range of mountains. No movement.

               He stoops to examine the trail.

               He paces it 'til he finds a print clear enough to give him 
               the animal's orientation.

               He stands and looks again toward the distant mountains. He 
               brings up the binoculars.

               His point-of-view: landscape, swimming into focus, heat waves 
               exaggerated by the compression of the lens.

               Panning, looking for the animal.

               Movement, very distant. The animal is brought into focus: a 
               black tailless dog, huge head, limping badly, phantasmal by 
               virtue of the rippling heat waves and the silence.

               Moss lowers the glass. A moment of thought as he gazes off. 

               He turns and heads in the direction from which the dog came.

               EXT. RISE NEAR BASIN - MINUTES LATER

               Moss tops a rise. He scans the landscape below. 

               Not much to see except-distant glints, off something not 
               native to the environment.

               Moss brings up the binoculars.

               Parked vehicles: three of them, squat, Broncos or other off-
               road trucks with fat tires, winches in the bed and racks of 
               roof lights.

               On the ground near the trucks dark shapes lie still.

               EXT. BASIN - MINUTES LATER

               Moss is walking cautiously up to the site, unslung rifle at 
               the ready.

               Flies drone.

               He circles two dead bodies lying in the grass, covered with 
               blood. A gut-shot dog of the same kind we saw limping toward 
               the mountains lies beside them. A sawed-off shotgun with a 
               pistol stock lies in the grass.

               The tires and most of the window glass are shot out of the 
               first pickup Moss approaches.

               He opens the door and looks inside.

               The driver is dead, leaning over the wheel. Moss shuts the 
               door.

               He opens the door of the second truck.

               The driver, sitting upright, still in shoulder harness, is 
               staring at him.

               Moss stumbles back, raising the rifle.

               The man does not move. The front of his shirt is covered 
               with blood.

                                     MAN
                         Agua.

               Moss stares at him

                                     MAN
                         ...Agua. Por Dios.

                                     MOSS
                         Ain't got no water.

               On the seat next to the man is an HK machine pistol. Moss 
               looks at it. He looks back at the man. The man is still 
               staring at him. Without lowering his eyes Moss reaches in 
               and takes the pistol.

               Moss straightens up out of the truck and slings the rifle 
               back over his shoulder. He snaps the clip off the machine 
               pistol, checks it and snaps it back on.

               Moss crosses to the back of the truck and lifts the tarp 
               that covers the truck bed.

               A load of brick-sized brown parcels each wrapped in plastic. 

               He throws the tarp back over the load and crosses back to 
               the open cab door.

                                     MAN
                         Agua.

                                     MOSS
                         I told you I ain't got no agua. You 
                         speak English? 

               A blank look.

                                     MOSS
                         ...Where's the last guy?

               The injured man stares, unresponsive. Moss persists:

                                     MOSS
                         Ultimo hombre. Last man standing, 
                         must've been one. Where'd he go?

                                     MAN
                         ...Agua.

               Moss turns to scan the horizon. He looks at the tire tracks 
               extending back from the truck. He thinks for a beat.

                                     MOSS
                              (to himself)
                         I reckon I'd go out the way I came 
                         in...

               He starts off.

               Through the truck's open door:

                                     MAN
                         La puerta... Hay lobos...

                                     MOSS
                              (walking off)
                         Ain't no lobos.

               EXT. FLATLAND NEAR THE BASIN - LATER

               Moss stops to look out at a new prospect. Flatland, no cover.

               He raises the binoculars.

                                     MOSS
                         If you stopped... to watch your 
                         backtrack... you're gonna shoot my 
                         dumb ass.

               He doesn't see anything. He lowers the glass, thinking.

               He raises the glass again.

                                     MOSS
                         ...But. If you stopped... you stopped 
                         in shade.

               He sets off.

               EXT. NEAR THE ROCK SHELF - DAY

               A POINT-OF-VIEW

               Through the binoculars, some time later. One lone shelf of 
               rock throws shade toward us. Heat shimmers in between.

               Hard sun makes the rock shadow impenetrable. But there is a 
               booted foot sticking into the sun toe-up like the nub on a 
               sundial.

               Moss lowers the binoculars.

               He looks at his watch.

               11:30.

               He sits down.

               FAST FADE

               EXT. NEAR THE ROCK SHELF - DAY

               THE WATCH

               12:30.

               Moss lowers the wristwatch and raises the binoculars again. 

               The shadow has shifted. The foot hasn't moved. 

               Moss gets up and walks toward it.

               EXT. ROCK SHELF - MINUTES LATER

               Moss arrives at the rock shelf.

               The man's body is tipped to one side. His nose is in the 
               dirt but his eyes are open, as if he is examining something 
               quite small on the ground.

               One hand holds a .45 automatic.

               Next to the body is a boxy leather document case.

               Moss looks at the man. He takes the gun, looks at it, sticks 
               it in his belt.

               He drags the document case away from the body and opens it. 

               Bank-wrapped hundreds fill it. Each packet is stamped 
               "$10,000."

               Moss stares. He reaches in to rifle the stacks, either to 
               confirm that the bag is full or to estimate the amount.

               He stands, looks around, looks back the way he came.

               EXT. CATTLEGUARD ROAD - DAY

               HIS TRUCK

               Moss's pickup is parked by a cattleguard off a paved but 
               little-used road.

               Moss is just arriving. He throws in the document case, the 
               rifle and the machine pistol, climbs into the cab and slams 
               the door.

               EXT. DESERT AIRE TRAILER PARK - TWILIGHT

               Moss's truck pulls into a trailer park that sits alongside 
               the highway on the outskirts of Sanderson, Texas. An old 
               sign with a neon palm tree identifies the park as the Desert 
               Aire.

               Moss gets out of the truck next to a double-wide. Lights 
               glow inside. He takes the case and machine pistol, gets down 
               on his back next to the trailer and scoots underneath it.

               His point-of-view: plywood and plastic pipes. He pulls some 
               insulation aside and crams the machine pistol up under the 
               pipes.

               INT. TRAILER - NIGHT

               Moss enters carrying the document case. A twentysomething 
               woman in cutoff jeans and a halter top watches TV. This is 
               Carla Jean.

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         What's in the satchel? 

                                     MOSS
                         It's full a money.

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         That'll be the day.

               Moss is crossing to a back bedroom. Before he disappears 
               inside Carla Jean sees the pistol stuck in the back of his 
               waistband.

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         ...Where'd you get the pistol?

                                     MOSS
                         At the gettin' place.

               He emerges without the case or the gun and crosses to the 
               refrigerator. He takes a beer from the refrigerator and peels 
               its pulltab.

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         Did you buy that gun? 

                                     MOSS
                         No. I found it.

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         Llewelyn!

                                     MOSS
                         What? Quit hollerin'.

               He walks back sipping the beer and sprawls on the couch. 

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         What'd you give for that thing?

                                     MOSS
                         You don't need to know everthing, 
                         Carla Jean.

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         I need to know that.

                                     MOSS
                         You keep running that mouth I'm gonna 
                         take you in the back and screw you.

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         Big talk.

                                     MOSS
                         Just keep it up.

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         Fine. I don't wanna know. I don't 
                         even wanna know where you been all 
                         day.

                                     MOSS
                         That'll work.

               INT. TRAILER BEDROOM - NIGHT

               We are drifting down toward Moss as he lies in bed next to 
               Carla Jean. He lies still, eyes closed, but he is shaking 
               his head. As the camera stops he opens his eyes, grimacing. 

                                     MOSS
                         All right.

               He looks at the bedside clock.

               Its LED display: 1:06.

               He swings his legs off the bed, looks back at Carla Jean, 
               and pulls the blanket up over her shoulder.

               INT. TRAILER KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Close on a gallon jug as Moss hold it under the tap, filling 
               it with water.

               Carla Jean appears in the doorway, looking sleepy.

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         Llewelyn.

                                     MOSS
                         Yeah.

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         What're you doin', baby? 

                                     MOSS
                         Goin' out.

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         Goin' where? 

                                     MOSS
                         Somethin' I forgot to do. I'll be 
                         back. 

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         What're you goin' to do? 

               Moss turns from the sink, screwing the top onto the jug.

                                     MOSS
                         I'm fixin' to do somethin' dumbern 
                         hell but I'm goin' anyways. 

               He starts toward the front door.

                                     MOSS
                         ...If I don't come back tell Mother 
                         I love her.

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.

                                     MOSS
                         Well then I'll tell her myself.

               INT. TRUCK/EXT. CATTLEGUARD ROAD - NIGHT

               A MAP

               A detailed topographical survey map, illuminated by a 
               flashlight.

               Moss is studying it in the cab of his truck.

               After a beat he folds the map.

               He checks the .45 taken off the corpse with the money.

               Wider: the pickup truck parked outside the cattle guard. 
               After a beat, the truck drives over the grate onto the unpaved 
               part of the road, jogging up the uneven terrain.

               Through the windshield, the view is pitch black except for 
               the boulders and scrub picked out by the crazily bouncing 
               headlights.

               EXT. BASIN - NIGHT

               DOOR SLAM

               We are close on the water jug slapping against Moss's leg as 
               we pull him through the darkness. The shape of his parked 
               truck is just visible behind him, silhouetted on the crest 
               by the glow of the moon already set.

               Walking across the basin to the near truck Moss freezes, 
               noticing:

               Its driver's-side door: closed.

               Moss scans the horizon. Its only blemish remains his own 
               pickup.

               He jogs the few remaining paces to the pickup. He sets down 
               the gallon jug. Softly:

                                     MOSS
                         Hello?...

               No answer.

               He opens the door.

               The man's body is still held upright by the shoulder harness 
               but his head, flayed by buckshot, is tipped away.

               Moss glances at the bed of the truck.

               Empty.

               He again looks at the horizon.

               Now another pickup stands in silhouette next to his own.  
               Two men are there.

               Moss covers behind the dead man's truck. He eases his head 
               out for another look.

               Only one man visible now.

               Sounds hard to identify. Something airy. Up on the crest his 
               pickup rocks and settles. Its tires are being slashed. 

               The other pickup's engine coughs to life. Headlights and 
               roof lights go on.

               Moss again covers behind the vehicle.

               A search-spot sweeps back and forth across the basin tableau 
               of bodies and trucks. After a few trips back and forth 
               something happens to the spot: its weaving light begins to 
               bounce. We can hear the jouncing suspension of the pickup as 
               it trundles down the incline.

               But the light tells the perspective of the slowly approaching 
               truck. Moss stays in the lee of his sheltering vehicle as he 
               runs, doubled over, directly away from the light, keeping to 
               the shadow that wipes on and off.

               A gunshot. Its impact kicks up dirt just ahead of Moss to 
               his right.

               Moss turns to see:

               Two jogging men flanking the truck like infantry escorting a 
               tank. One has just halted to fire; the other is now raising 
               his gun.

               Moss tacks and sprints and rolls under a second abandoned 
               pickup to his left. Another shot sounds and misses.

               Bullets plunk into the metal of the truck body. One bullet 
               skips off the dirt in front of the truck and pings up into 
               the undercarriage.

               Moss is elbowing out the far side, next to a body lying by 
               the truck's passenger door.

               The firing has stopped: Moss steals a look over the hood: 

               The pursuing pickup is slowing so that the two gunmen can 
               swing onto the running boards.

               The truck accelerates and as it veers around the first 
               abandoned pickup its lights swing off Moss's cover truck.

               Moss sprints off, doubled over, at a perpendicular to his 
               previous path. He hits the ground, pressing himself into the 
               earth, head between his forearms.

               He elbows away as the truck bears on his former cover.

               EXT. RIVER GORGE - DAWN

               He tops the small rise and straightens and flat-out runs.  
               We hear the pickup's engine racing and see, behind Moss, its 
               spot sweeping backlight across the crest.

               Moss is running towards the declivity of a river gorge. Sky 
               there is pink from unrisen sun.

               Moss bears on the gorge, panting.

               The pickup bounces up into view on the crest behind him, 
               roof lights blazing. It is pointed off at an angle. Its 
               spotlight sweeps the river plain.

               It finds Moss. The truck reorients as it bounces down in 
               pursuit. A muzzle flash precedes the dull whump of the 
               shotgun.

               Moss races on toward the river. Another shotgun whump.     
               Moss stumbles, turns to look behind him.

               The truck, gaining ground. A man stands up out of the sunroof, 
               one hand on top of the cab, the other holding a shotgun.

               Moss is almost to the steep riverbank. Another whump of the 
               shotgun.

               Shot catches Moss on the right shoulder. It tears the back 
               of his shirt away and sends him over the crest of the river 
               bank.

               Moss airborne, ass over elbows, hits near the bottom of the 
               sandy slope with a loud fhump.

               He rolls to a stop and looks up.

               We hear a skidding squeal and see dirt and dust float over 
               the lip of the ridge, thrown by the truck's hard stop.

               As Moss pulls off his boots we hear voices from the men in 
               the truck.

               There is the clank of its tailgate being dropped and sounds 
               of activity on the hollow metal of its bed.

               Moss tucks his boots into his belt and runs splashing into 
               the fast-moving water. A look back:

               Something shakes the scrub down the steep slope.

               Moss backpedals deeper.

               Bursting out of the scrub at the foot of the slope: a huge 
               black dog with a large head and clipped ears. It bounds toward 
               Moss.

               Moss turns and half stumbles, half dives into the river. 
               Underwater a very dull whump followed by the fizz of buckshot.

               Moss breaks the surface of the water, gasping, and looks 
               back:

               Figures on the ridge. Below, the dog hitting the water. 

               Another gunshot from the bank. Where it hits we don't know. 
               River current and Moss's strokes speed him away.

               EXT. RIVER BEND - DAWN

               He sweeps around a bend. He finds his feet under him and 
               staggers onto a sandbar and then splashes through some outwash 
               to the far bank.

               The pursuing dog's head bobs rhythmically in the water.

               Moss pulls the gun from his belt. He takes the clip out and 
               ejects the chamber round.

               The dog finds his stumpy legs much closer to the sandbar: 
               his massive head dips and waggles as he lurches out of his 
               swim. He emerges from the river and bounds across the sand. 

               Moss shakes the gun and blows into the barrel.

               The dog splashes through the riverwash that separates him 
               from the human.

               Moss reinserts the clip. He chambers a round as the dog runs 
               snarling and as the dog leaps he fires.

               Moss fires twice more quickly, not waiting to see whether 
               the first round told.

               The dog lands, stopped but not dead. It jerks and gurgles.

                                     MOSS
                         Goddamnit.

               He is looking out at the river. His boots are drifting by.

               EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY

               Moss has climbed the far bank and found a seat on a rock.  
               It is now full day. Moss has taken off his shirt and has his 
               neck craned round and his back upper arm twisted toward him. 
               Where the buckshot hit, his arm is purpled and pinpricked. 
               He meticulously picks shirt fiber out from where buckshot 
               packed it into the flesh.

               He finishes. He rips swatches from his shirt. He starts 
               wrapping his bare feet as he gazes off.

               His point-of-view: a lot of landscape, a highway in the 
               distance. An eighteen-wheeler shimmies along in the heat.

               EXT. GAS STATION/GROCERY - SHEFFIELD - DAY

               At an isolated dusty crossroad. It is twilight. The Ford 
               sedan that Chigurh stopped is parked alongside the pump.

               INT. GAS STATION/GROCERY - DAY

               Chigurh stands at the counter across from the elderly 
               proprietor. He holds up a bag of cashews.

                                     CHIGURH
                         How much? 

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         Sixty-nine cent.

                                     CHIGURH
                         This. And the gas.

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         Y'all getting any rain up your way? 

                                     CHIGURH
                         What way would that be? 

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         I seen you was from Dallas.

               Chigurh tears open the bag of cashews and pours a few into 
               his hand.

                                     CHIGURH
                         What business is it of yours where 
                         I'm from, friendo? 

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         I didn't mean nothin' by it.

                                     CHIGURH
                         Didn't mean nothin'.

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         I was just passin' the time.

                                     CHIGURH
                         I guess that passes for manners in 
                         your cracker view of things.

               A beat.

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         Well sir I apologize. If you don't 
                         wanna accept that I don't know what 
                         else I can do for you.

               Chigurh stands chewing cashews, staring while the old man 
               works the register and puts change on the counter.

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         ...Will there be somethin' else?

                                     CHIGURH
                         I don't know. Will there? 

               Beat.

               The proprietor turns and coughs. Chigurh stares.

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         Is somethin' wrong? 

                                     CHIGURH
                         With what? 

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         With anything? 

                                     CHIGURH
                         Is that what you're asking me? Is 
                         there something wrong with anything? 

               The proprietor looks at him, uncomfortable, looks away.

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         Will there be anything else? 

                                     CHIGURH
                         You already asked me that.

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         Well... I need to see about closin'.

                                     CHIGURH
                         See about closing.

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         Yessir.

                                     CHIGURH
                         What time do you close? 

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         Now. We close now.

                                     CHIGURH
                         Now is not a time. What time do you 
                         close.

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         Generally around dark. At dark.

               Chigurh stares, slowly chewing.

                                     CHIGURH
                         You don't know what you're talking 
                         about, do you?

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         Sir?

                                     CHIGURH
                         I said you don't know what you're 
                         talking about.

               Chigurh chews.

                                     CHIGURH
                         ...What time do you go to bed.

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         Sir? 

                                     CHIGURH
                         You're a bit deaf, aren't you? I 
                         said what time do you go to bed.

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         Well...

               A pause.

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         ...I'd say around nine-thirty. 
                         Somewhere around nine-thirty.

                                     CHIGURH
                         I could come back then.

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         Why would you be comin' back? We'll 
                         be closed.

                                     CHIGURH
                         You said that.

               He continues to stare, chewing.

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         Well... I need to close now --

                                     CHIGURH
                         You live in that house behind the 
                         store?

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         Yes I do.

                                     CHIGURH
                         You've lived here all your life? 

               A beat.

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         This was my wife's father's place. 
                         Originally.

                                     CHIGURH
                         You married into it.

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         We lived in Temple Texas for many 
                         years. Raised a family there. In 
                         Temple. We come out here about four 
                         years ago.

                                     CHIGURH
                         You married into it.

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         ...If that's the way you wanna put 
                         it.

                                     CHIGURH
                         I don't have some way to put it. 
                         That's the way it is.

               He finishes the cashews and wads the packet and sets it on 
               the counter where it begins to slowly unkink. The proprietor's 
               eyes have tracked the packet. Chigurh's eyes stay on the 
               proprietor.

                                     CHIGURH
                         ...What's the most you've ever lost 
                         on a coin toss?

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         Sir? 

                                     CHIGURH
                         The most. You ever lost. On a coin 
                         toss.

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         I don't know. I couldn't say.

               Chigurh is digging in his pocket. A quarter: he tosses it. 
               He slaps it onto his forearm but keeps it covered.

                                     CHIGURH
                         Call it.

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         Call it?

                                     CHIGURH
                         Yes.

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         For what? 

                                     CHIGURH
                         Just call it.

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         Well -- we need to know what it is 
                         we're callin' for here. 

                                     CHIGURH
                         You need to call it. I can't call it 
                         for you. It wouldn't be fair. It 
                         wouldn't even be right. 

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         I didn't put nothin' up.

                                     CHIGURH
                         Yes you did. You been putting it up 
                         your whole life. You just didn't 
                         know it. You know what date is on 
                         this coin? 

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         No.

                                     CHIGURH
                         Nineteen fifty-eight. It's been 
                         traveling twenty-two years to get 
                         here. And now it's here. And it's 
                         either heads or tails, and you have 
                         to say. Call it.

               A long beat.

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         Look... I got to know what I stand 
                         to win.

                                     CHIGURH
                         Everything.

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         How's that? 

                                     CHIGURH
                         You stand to win everything. Call 
                         it.

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         All right. Heads then.

               Chigurh takes his hand away from the coin and turns his arm 
               to look at it.

                                     CHIGURH
                         Well done.

               He hands it across.

                                     CHIGURH
                         ...Don't put it in your pocket.

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         Sir? 

                                     CHIGURH
                         Don't put it in your pocket. It's 
                         your lucky quarter. 

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         ...Where you want me to put it? 

                                     CHIGURH
                         Anywhere not in your pocket. Or it'll 
                         get mixed in with the others and 
                         become just a coin. Which it is.

               He turns and goes.

               The proprietor watches him.

               EXT. DESERT AIRE - NIGHT

               It is full night.

               Moss is pushing open the door to his trailer. We see Carla 
               Jean inside.

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         Llewelyn? What the hell? 

               Moss enters and the door closes.

               INT. MOSS' TRAILER - LATER

               Carla Jean is finishing bandaging his arm.

                                     MOSS
                         Odessa.

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         Why would we go to Odessa? 

                                     MOSS
                         Not we, you. Stay with your mother.

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         Well -- how come?

               MOSS

               Right now it's midnight Sunday. When the courthouse opens 
               nine hours from now someone's gonna be callin in the vehicle 
               number off the inspection plate on my truck. And around nine-
               thirty they'll show up here.

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         So... for how long do we have to...

                                     MOSS
                         Baby, at what point would you quit 
                         botherin' to look for your two million 
                         dollars? 

               Carla Jean stares, thinking.

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         What'm I supposed to tell Mama?

                                     MOSS
                         Try standin' in the door and hollerin: 
                         Mama I'm home.

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         Llewelyn --

                                     MOSS
                         C'mon, pack your things. Anything 
                         you leave you ain't gonna see again.

               Carla Jean begins peevishly tossing things into a bag:

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         Well thanks for fallin' all over and 
                         apologizing.

                                     MOSS
                         Things happened. I can't take 'em 
                         back.

               EXT. CATTLEGUARD ROAD - NIGHT

               POINT-OF-VIEW THROUGH WINDSHIELD

               It is night. No other vehicles on this paved road.

               Our car turns off and rattles over a cattleguard.

               Parked on the other side is a Ramcharger. Its passenger door 
               starts to open.

               Outside: Chigurh emerges from his Ford.

               The man emerging from the truck wears a Western-cut suit. 

                                     MAN
                         Mind ridin' bitch?

               EXT. BASIN - NIGHT

               THE RAMCHARGER

               Bouncing through ungraded terrain.

               It stops and discharges the three men-the driver and his 
               partner, both in suits, from either side, and then Chigurh 
               from the middle seat.

               They have pulled over at Moss's truck.

                                     CHIGURH
                         This his truck? 

               He is opening the door and looking at the plate riveted 
               inside.

                                     MAN
                         Mm-hm.

                                     CHIGURH
                         Screwgie.

               The man reaches into a pocket and hands over a screwdriver. 
               As Chigurh works it under the plate:

                                     CHIGURH
                         ...Who slashed his tires?

                                     DRIVER
                         Wudden us.

               EXT. BASIN - NIGHT

               A flashlight beam picks out the dog carcass.

                                     DRIVER
                         That's a dead dog.

                                     CHIGURH
                         Thank you.

               Chigurh plays the flashlight around the scene. Dead bodies 
               on the ground.

                                     CHIGURH
                         ...Where's the transponder?

                                     MAN
                         In the truck.  I'll get it.

                                     DRIVER
                         These are some ripe petunias.

               Chigurh gives his flashlight to the driver.

                                     CHIGURH
                         Hold this please.

               He bends down and takes a 9 mm. Glock off of one of the dead 
               bodies and checks the clip. The other man is returning from 
               the truck. He hands Chigurh a small electronic receiver.

                                     CHIGURH
                         ...You getting anything on this?

                                     MAN
                         Not a bleep.

                                     CHIGURH
                         All right...

               Chigurh stands and holds his hand out for his flashlight.

               The driver hands it to him. Chigurh shines it in his face 
               and shoots him through the forehead. As the man falls Chigurh 
               pans the light to the other man who has watched his partner 
               drop. He looks up, puzzled, and is shot as well.

               EXT. BELL'S RANCH - MORNING

               A horse trailer is backed up to a small stable with its gate 
               down.

               Sheriff Bell, sixties, in uniform, slaps a horse on the ass 
               and gives it a "Hyah!" to send it clattering up the ramp and 
               into the trailer.

               His wife, Loretta, appears. She wears a heavy robe and holds 
               a coffee mug.

                                     LORETTA
                         I thought it was a car afire.

                                     BELL
                         It is a car afire. But Wendell said 
                         there was something back country 
                         too.

                                     LORETTA
                         When is the county gonna start payin' 
                         a rental on my horse. 

                                     BELL
                         Hyah! 

               He is sending a second horse up into the trailer.

                                     BELL
                         ...I love you more'n more, ever day.

                                     LORETTA
                              (unmoved)
                         That's very nice.

               Sheriff Bell puts up the gate and pins it. She watches.

                                     LORETTA
                         ...Be careful.

                                     BELL
                         I always am.

                                     LORETTA
                         Don't get hurt.

                                     BELL
                         I never do.

                                     LORETTA
                         Don't hurt no one.

                                     BELL
                         Well. If you say so.

               EXT. CATTLEGUARD ROAD - DAY

               The pickup with horse trailer rattles up next to a parked 
               squad car. Just beyond the cattle guard the Ford sedan is 
               blazing. Sheriff Bell gets out of the truck and joins his 
               deputy, Wendell, looking at the car. After a beat of staring: 

                                     BELL
                         You wouldn't think a car would burn 
                         like that.

                                     WENDELL
                         Yessir. We should a brought wieners.

               Sheriff Bell takes his hat off and mops his brow.

                                     BELL
                         Does that look to you like about a 
                         '77 Ford, Wendell? 

                                     WENDELL
                         It could be.

                                     BELL
                         I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my 
                         mind.

                                     WENDELL
                         The old boy shot by the highway?

                                     BELL
                         Yessir, his vehicle. Man killed 
                         Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed 
                         someone on the highway, swapped for 
                         his car, and now here it is and he's 
                         swapped again for god knows what. 

                                     WENDELL
                         That's very linear Sheriff.

               Bell stares at the fire.

                                     BELL
                         Well. Old age flattens a man.

                                     WENDELL
                         Yessir. But then there's this other. 
                         He nods up the ridge away from the 
                         highway.

                                     BELL
                         Uh-huh.

               He walks back toward the trailer.

                                     BELL
                         ...You ride Winston.

                                     WENDELL
                         You sure? 

                                     BELL
                         Oh, I'm more than sure. Anything 
                         happens to Loretta's horse I can 
                         tell you right now you don't wanna 
                         be the party that was aboard.

               EXT. BASIN - DAY

               The two men on horseback pick their way through the scrub 
               approaching Moss's truck. Sheriff Bell is studying the ground.

                                     BELL
                         It's the same tire tread comin back 
                         as goin'. Made about the same time. 
                         You can see the sipes real clear. 

               Wendell is standing in the stirrups, looking up the ridge.

                                     WENDELL
                         Truck's just yonder. Somebodies pried 
                         the inspection plate off the door.

               Bell looks up, circling the truck.

                                     BELL
                         I know this truck. Belongs to a feller 
                         named Moss.

                                     WENDELL
                         Llewelyn Moss? 

                                     BELL
                         That's the boy.

                                     WENDELL
                         You figure him for a dope runner? 

               Bell sits his horse looking at the slashed tires.

                                     BELL
                         I don't know but I kindly doubt it.

               BASIN - DAY

               BY THE BODIES

               The two lawmen are dismounting.

                                     WENDELL
                         Hell's bells, they even shot the 
                         dog.

               They walk towards the near truck.

                                     WENDELL
                         ...Well this is just a deal gone 
                         wrong.

               Sheriff Bell stoops to look at casings.

                                     BELL
                         Yes, appears to have been a glitch 
                         or two.

                                     WENDELL
                         What calibers you got there, Sheriff?

                                     BELL
                         Nine millimeter. Couple of .45 ACP's.

               He stands, looking at the truck.

                                     BELL
                         ...Somebody unloaded on this thing 
                         with a shotgun.

                                     WENDELL
                         Mm.

               Bell opens the door of the truck. Looks at the dead driver.

                                     WENDELL
                         ...How come do you reckon the coyotes 
                         ain't been at 'em?

                                     BELL
                         I don't know...

               He shuts the door softly with two hands.

                                     BELL
                         ...Supposedly they won't eat a 
                         Mexican.

               Wendell is looking at the two corpses close together, wearing 
               suits.

                                     WENDELL
                         These boys appear to be managerial.

               Bell walks back toward the bed of the truck as Wendell 
               appraises:

                                     WENDELL
                         ...I think we're lookin' at more'n 
                         one fracas.

               A gesture toward the scattered bodies.

                                     WENDELL
                         ...Wild West over there...

               A nod down at the two men in suits with head wounds.

                                     WENDELL
                         ...Execution here.

               Bell, at the back of the truck, wets a finger and runs it 
               against the bed and looks at it.

                                     BELL
                         That Mexican brown dope.

               Wendell strolls among the bodies.

                                     WENDELL
                         These boys is all swole up. So this 
                         was earlier: gettin set to trade. 
                         Then, whoa, differences... You know: 
                         might not of even been no money.

                                     BELL
                         That's possible.

                                     WENDELL
                         But you don't believe it.

                                     BELL
                         No. Probably I don't.

                                     WENDELL
                         It's a mess, ain't it Sheriff? 

               Bell is remounting.

                                     BELL
                         If it ain't it'll do til a mess gets 
                         here.

               EXT. MOSS' TRAILER - DAY

               AIR TANK

               We follow it being toted along a gravel path and up three 
               shallow steps to a trailer door.

               A hand rises to knock. Tubing runs out of the sleeve and 
               into the fist clenched to knock. The door rattles under the 
               knock. A short beat.

               The hand opens to press the nozzle at the end of the tube 
               against the lock cylinder. A sharp report.

               INSIDE

               A cylinder of brass from the door slams into the far wall 
               denting it and drops to the floor and rolls.

               Reverse on the door. Daylight shows through the lock.

               The door swings slowly in and Chigurh, hard backlit, enters. 

               He sets the tank down by the door. He looks around.

               He ambles in. He opens a door.

               The bedroom, a messy aftermath of hasty packing.

               The main room. Mail is stacked on the counter that separates 
               a kitchen area.

               Chigurh flips unhurriedly through the pieces. One of them is 
               a phone bill. He puts it in his pocket.

               He goes to the refrigerator. He opens it. He looks for a 
               still beat. He decides.

               He reaches out a quart of milk. He goes to the main room 
               sofa and sits. He pinches the spout open and drinks.

               He looks at himself in the dead gray-green screen of the 
               facing television.

               INT. DESERT AIRE OFFICE - DAY

               Chigurh enters. Old plywood paneling, gunmetal desk, litter 
               of papers. A window air-conditioner works hard.

               A fifty-year-old woman with a cast-iron hairdo sits behind 
               the desk.

                                     WOMAN
                         Yessir? 

                                     CHIGURH
                         I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.

                                     WOMAN
                         Did you go up to his trailer?

                                     CHIGURH
                         Yes I did.

                                     WOMAN
                         Well I'd say he's at work. Do you 
                         want to leave a message? 

                                     CHIGURH
                         Where does he work? 

                                     WOMAN
                         I can't say.

                                     CHIGURH
                         Where does he work?

                                     WOMAN
                         Sir I ain't at liberty to give out 
                         no information about our residents.

               Chigurh looks around the office. He looks at the woman. 

                                     CHIGURH
                         Where does he work? 

                                     WOMAN
                         Did you not hear me? We can't give 
                         out no information.

               A toilet flushes somewhere. A door unlatches. Footsteps in 
               back.

               Chigurh reacts to the noise. He looks at the woman. He turns 
               and opens the door and leaves.

               INT. TRAILWAYS BUS - DAY

               Some of the passengers are getting out. Moss is up in the 
               aisle reaching a bag down from the overhead rack. He lifts 
               the document case from the floor where Carla Jean still sits 
               next to the window.

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         Why all the way to Del Rio? 

                                     MOSS
                         I'm gonna borrow a car. From Eldon.

               Carla Jean nods at the document case.

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         You can't afford one? 

                                     MOSS
                         Don't wanna register it. I'll call 
                         you in a couple days. 

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         Promise? 

                                     MOSS
                         Yes I do.

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         I got a bad feelin', Llewelyn.

                                     MOSS
                         Well I got  a good one. So they ought 
                         to even out. Quit worrying about

                                     MOSS
                         Uh-huh.

                                     CARLA JEAN

                         retired.

               EXT. MOSS'S TRAILER - DAY

               Wendell is knocking at its door. Sheriff Bell stands one 
               step behind him.

                                     WENDELL
                         Sheriff's Department! 

               No answer.

                                     BELL
                         Look at the lock.

               They both look. A beat.

                                     WENDELL
                         We goin' in?

                                     BELL
                         Gun out and up.

               Wendell unholsters his gun but hesitates.

                                     WENDELL
                         What about yours? 

                                     BELL
                         I'm hidin' behind you.

               Wendell eases the door open.

                                     WENDELL
                         Sheriff's Department!

               INT. MOSS' TRAILER - DAY

               The men cautiously enter, Wendell leading.

                                     WENDELL
                         ...Nobody here.

               He lowers his gun and starts to holster it.

                                     BELL
                         No reason not to stay safe.

               Wendell keeps the gun out.

                                     WENDELL
                         No sir.

               He goes to the bedroom door as Sheriff Bell, seeing the lock 
               cylinder on the floor, stoops and hefts it.

               He looks up at the wall opposite the door: the small dent. 

               Wendell pulls his head out of the bedroom.

                                     WENDELL
                         ...I believe they've done lit a shuck.

                                     BELL
                         Believe you're right.

                         That from the lock?

               Sheriff Bell stands and wanders, looking around.

                                     BELL
                         Probably must be.

                                     WENDELL
                         So when was he here? 

                                     BELL
                         I don't know. Oh.

               He is at the counter staring at something.

                                     BELL
                         ...Now that's aggravating.

                         Sheriff? 

               Sheriff Bell points at the carton of milk.

                                     BELL
                         Still sweating.

               Wendell is agitated.

                                     WENDELL
                         Whoa! Sheriff! 

               Sheriff Bell unhurriedly opens a cabinet. He looks closes 
               it, opens another.

                                     WENDELL
                         ...Sheriff, we just missed him! We 
                         gotta circulate this! On the radio!

               Sheriff Bell takes a glass from the cabinet.

                                     BELL
                         Well, okay...

               He pours milk into the glass.

                                     BELL
                         ...What do we circulate?

               He sits on the sofa and takes a sip from the milk.

                                     BELL
                         ...Lookin' for a man who has recently 
                         drunk milk?

               Wendell stares at him.

                                     WENDELL
                         Sheriff, that's aggravating.

                                     BELL
                         I'm ahead of you there.

               Wendell gazes around the trailer, shaking his head.

                                     WENDELL
                         You think this boy Moss has got any 
                         notion of the sorts of sons of bitches 
                         that are huntin' him? 

                                     BELL
                         I don't know. He ought to...

               Sheriff Bell takes another sip.

                                     BELL
                         ...He seen the same things I seen 
                         and it made an impression on me.

               EXT. BUS STATION CAB STAND - DEL RIO - DAY

               Moss emerges from the station and goes to a cab.

               As he sits in:

                                     MOSS
                         Take me to a motel.

                                     CABBIE
                         You got one in mind?

                                     MOSS
                         Just someplace cheap.

                         You tell me the option.

                                     MOSS
                         The what?

                                     WOMAN
                         The option.

               Wider shows that we are in a motel lobby. A woman faces Moss 
               across a Formica counter top She has handed him the framed 
               rate card.

                                     WOMAN
                         ...You pick the option with the 
                         applicable rate.

                                     MOSS
                         I'm just one person. Don't matter 
                         the size of the bed.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

               Wide on the room. Twin-bed headboards are fixed to the wall 
               but only the far one has a bed parked beneath it. Moss sits 
               on the bed, phone to his ear. It rings a couple times.

               He gives up, hangs up, rises.

               INT. BATHROOM - DAY

               Moss stands in front of the mirror, twisted around to examine 
               the buckshot wound. He shrugs his shirt back on.

               Holding on the mirror we see him walk back into the main 
               room and stop, looking around. He looks slowly up to the 
               ceiling.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

               CLOSE ON A SCREW

               Being unscrewed. Wider shows us Moss, standing on the bed, 
               unscrewing the vent on an overhead airduct.

               He gets down off the bed, unzips his duffle bag and takes 
               the document case out of it. He opens the case, takes out a 
               packet of bills, counts out some money and puts it in his 
               pocket. He refastens the case.

               He goes to the window and cuts off a length of the curtain 
               cord. He ties the curtain cord to the handle of the document 
               case. He goes to the closet, leaving the case on the bed.

               He reaches into the empty closet, lifts the coat rail off 
               its supports and lets the hangers slide off onto the floor.

               INT. LOOKING DOWN THE AIRDUCT - DAY

               The duct hums with a low, airy compressor sound. The 
               galvanized metal stretches away to a distant elbow. The 
               document case is plunked down in the foreground and then 
               gently pushed down the length of the tube by the coat pole. 
               The free end of the cord trails off the handle for retrieval.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

               THE DUFFLE

               Moss unzips it and pulls out the machine pistol and the .45 
               that he took off the dead man. He lifts the mattress and 
               stashes the machine pistol underneath. He checks the chamber 
               of the .45 and stuffs it in his belt.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM/EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

               THE WINDOW

               Moss pulls back one curtain to look out at the lot.

               Nothing there disturbs him.

               He closes the curtains, crossing one over the other.

               He goes out the door, shutting it softly behind him.

               INT. ROADSIDE DINER - DAY

               PHONE BILL

               A pencil taps at a Del Rio number that repeats on the bill. 
               We hear phone-filtered rings.

               The rings are cut off by the clatter of a hang-up. The pencil 
               moves to an Odessa number, the only other repeat on the short 
               list of toll calls.

               We cut up to Chigurh as he finishes dialing, in the booth of 
               a roadside diner. Dusk.

               Phone-filtered rings. Connection; a woman's voice:

                                     WOMAN
                         Hello?

                                     CHIGURH
                         Is Llewelyn there? 

                                     WOMAN
                         Llewelyn?! No he ain't.

                                     CHIGURH
                         You expect him? 

               The woman's voice is old, querulous:

                                     WOMAN
                         Now why would I expect him? Who is 
                         this? 

               Chigurh stares for a short beat, then prongs the phone.

               INT. A SMALL GENERAL STORE - DAY

               Moss is standing in front of a rack of cowboy boots at the 
               back of the store. He looks up at an approaching salesman, a 
               bow-legged old man in a white shirt.

                                     SALESMAN
                         Hep you? 

                                     MOSS
                         I need the Larry Mahan's in black, 
                         size 11.

                                     SALESMAN
                         Okay.

                                     MOSS
                         You sell socks? 

                                     SALESMAN
                         Just white.

               He gathers up a brown paper bag from a pharmacy.

                                     MOSS
                         White is all I wear. You got a 
                         bathroom?

               INT. BATHROOM - DAY

               Moss is sitting on the toilet taking off socks with bloody 
               soles. Sneakers sit on the floor. The pharmacy bag sits next 
               to them.

               He sprays disinfectant on his feet. He takes out bandages.

               INT. SHOE STORE - DAY

               Moss is returning. The bowlegged salesman stands in the aisle 
               holding aloft a pair of boots.

                                     SALESMAN
                         Ain't got Larries in black but I got 
                         'em in osta-rich. Break in easy.

               INT. CAB/EXT. DEL RIO MOTEL - NIGHT

               It is rolling to a stop in front of Charlie Goodnight's Del 
               Rio Motor Hotel.

               Moss fishes for his wallet but stops, looking.

               Parked in the street in front of the motel is an offroad 
               truck with roof lights.

                                     MOSS
                         Don't stop. Just ride me up past the 
                         rooms.

                                     DRIVER
                         What room? 

                                     MOSS
                         Just drive me around. I want to see 
                         if someone's here. 

               The cab rolls slowly up the lot.

                                     MOSS
                         ...Keep going.

               His pivoting point-of-view of his room. The window shows a 
               part between the curtains.

                                     MOSS
                         ...Keep going. Don't stop.

                                     DRIVER
                         I don't want to get in some kind of 
                         a jackpot here, buddy. 

                                     MOSS
                         It's all right.

                                     DRIVER
                         Why don't I set you down here and we 
                         won't argue about it.

                                     MOSS
                         I want you to take me to another 
                         motel.

                                     DRIVER
                         Let's just call it square.

               Moss reaches a hundred-dollar bill up to the driver.

                                     MOSS
                         You're already in a jackpot. I'm 
                         trying to get you out of it. Now 
                         take me to a motel.

               The driver reaches up for the bill then turns the cab out of 
               the parking lot onto the hiway. Moss turns to look at the 
               receding lights of the motel.

               EXT. THROUGHWAY INTERCHANGE - NIGHT

               PAVEMENT

               Rushing under the lens, lit by headlights.

               From high up we see a throughway interchange as Chigurh's 
               Ramcharger takes the right fork of the highway under a green 
               sign for Del Rio.

               INT. THE RAMCHARGER - NIGHT

               Chigurh looks down at the passenger seat. On it lies the 
               transponder, powered on but silent. Next to it is a machine 
               pistol with a can-shaped silencer sweated onto the barrel. 

               The transponder beeps once.

               Chigurh looks up. We are approaching a steel bridge. The 
               headlights pick up a large black bird perched on the aluminum 
               bridge rail.

               The passenger window hums down.

               Chigurh picks up the pistol and levels the barrel across the 
               window frame.

               The truck bumps onto the bridge, its tires skipping over the 
               seams in the asphalt. As it draws even the bird spreads its 
               wings and Chigurh fires-a muted thump like a whoosh of air. 

               From high overhead: the bullet hits the guardrail making it 
               hum as the Ramcharger recedes and the bird lifts into the 
               darkness, heavily flapping its wings.

               INT. CAFE - MORNING

               Morning. Bell sits drinking coffee. Wendell stands in the 
               aisle handing something over.

                                     WENDELL
                         He labs from Austin on the man by 
                         the highway.

               Bell takes the papers and starts to look at them.

                                     BELL
                         What was the bullet? 

                                     WENDELL
                         Wasn't no bullet.

               This brings Bell's look up.

                                     BELL
                         Wasn't no bullet? 

                                     WENDELL
                         Yessir. Wasn't none.

                                     BELL
                         Well, Wendell, with all due respect, 
                         that don't make a whole lot of sense.

                                     WENDELL
                         No sir.

                                     BELL
                         You said entrance wound in the 
                         forehead, no exit wound.

                                     WENDELL
                         Yes sir.

               EXT. SPORTING GOODS STORE - DAY

               Moss pushes off from the wall he was leaning against: someone 
               inside the glass double doors is stooping to unlock them.

               INT. SPORTING GOODS STORE - GUN COUNTER - DAY

               The clerk is handing a shotgun across the counter.

                                     CLERK
                         Twelve gauge. You need shells? Moss 
                         looks the gun over.

                                     MOSS
                         Uh-huh. Double ought.

                                     CLERK
                         They'll give you a wallop.

               He pushes the shells across.

                                     MOSS
                         You have camping supplies?

               ANOTHER COUNTER

               A clerk stares at Moss.

                                     CLERK
                         Tent poles.

                         Uh-huh.

                                     CLERK
                         You already have the tent?

                         Somethin' like that.

                                     CLERK
                         Well you give me the model number of 
                         the tent I can order you the poles.

                                     MOSS
                         Never mind.  I want a tent.

                                     CLERK
                         What kind of tent? 

                                     MOSS
                         The kind with the most poles.

                                     CLERK
                         Well I guess that'd be our ten-foot 
                         backyard Per-Gola. You can stand up 
                         in it. Well, some people could stand 
                         up in it. Six foot clearance at the 
                         ridge. You might just could.

                                     MOSS
                         Let me have that one. Where's the 
                         nearest hardware store?

               INT. MOSS' NEW MOTEL ROOM - DAY

               He has the shotgun wedged in an open drawer and is sawing 
               off its barrel with a hacksaw.

               MINUTES LATER

               Moss sits on the bed dressing the barrel with a file.

               He puts down the file, looks at the barrel. He slides the 
               forearm back and forward again and lets the hammer down with 
               his thumb. He looks the gun over, appraising, and then opens 
               the box of shells and starts feeding in the heavy waxed loads.

               INT. FIRST MOTEL LOBBY - DAY

               Moss enters carrying a new duffle bag. The same woman is 
               behind the counter.

                                     MOSS
                         Could I get another room.

                                     WOMAN
                         You want to change rooms? 

                                     MOSS
                         No, I want to keep my room, and get 
                         another one.

                                     WOMAN
                         Another additional.

                                     MOSS
                         Uh-huh.You got a map of the rooms? 

               She inclines her head to look under the counter.

                                     WOMAN
                         Yeah we had a sorta one.

               She finds a brochure and hands it across. It shows a car 
               from the fifties parked in front of the hotel in hard 
               sunlight.

               Moss unfolds the brochure and studies.

                                     MOSS
                         What about one forty-two.

                                     WOMAN
                         You can have the one next to yours 
                         if you want. One twenty.  It ain't 
                         took.

                                     MOSS
                         No, one forty-two.

                                     WOMAN
                         That's got two double beds.

               EXT. MOTEL PARKING LOT - DAY

               An arcing point of view on the window of Moss's old room. 
               The curtain still slightly open.

               A reverse shows Moss crossing the lot from the office carrying 
               his long nylon duffle bag, studying the room.  He looks 
               further down the street.

               The truck with the roof lights is still parked there.

               INT. 2ND MOTEL ROOM

               Two double beds. Moss is listening at the wall. He goes to 
               the bed and unzips the duffle bag and pulls out the sawed-
               off shotgun. He lays it on the bed. He pulls the tent poles 
               and some duct tape out of the duffle.

               INT. CHIGURH'S TRUCK/TWO LANE HIGHWAY - LATE DAY

               CHIGURH

               Driving slowly down the street with frequent glances down at 
               the receiver on the seat next to him. The receiver lights 
               ups and bleeps one time.

               Chigurh slows and looks around at the buildings that line 
               the two-lane highway.

               INT. 2ND MOTEL ROOM - LATE DAY

               Moss is standing on a desk chair unscrewing the plate from 
               the overhead airduct. He lays it aside and raises a flashlight 
               and peers into the airduct.

               INT. MOTEL DUCT - LATE DAY

               Down the length of the duct we see an elbow junction ten 
               feet away. The end of the document case is just visible 
               sticking out into the elbow.

               CHIGURH

               The receiver is bleeping slowly as the car creeps along. Up 
               at a distant intersection is Charlie Goodnight's Del Rio 
               Motel.

               INT. 2ND MOTEL ROOM

               Moss rips off a length of duct tape. He wraps it around two 
               tent poles placed end-to-end but an inch apart, not butting. 
               He gives the tape several winds.

               EXT. MOTEL PARKING LOT - LATE DAY

               CHIGURH

               He is slowly driving the parking lot, the receiver now in 
               his lap.

               The beeping frequency peaks and then starts to fall off. 
               Chigurh puts the truck in reverse and eases back to the peak. 

               His point-of-view: window with parted curtains.

               INT. 2ND MOTEL ROOM - LATE DAY

               Moss experiments with the tape-joint, angling then 
               straightening the two poles. Satisfied, he starts taping on 
               a third length of pole.

               INT. MOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

               Chigurh stands across the counter from the clerk who looks 
               at him, waiting.

               He is frowning at the rate card.

               INT. CHIGURH'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               DOOR

               It swings slowly in toward us. Chigurh stands in the doorway.  
               The room-number bangle hangs off the key in the knob.

               He stares in for a beat.

               He enters slowly and reaches up for the light switch. He 
               doesn't turn it on. He drops his hand. He reaches up again, 
               feeling it.

               He looks around the room. He takes the key and closes the 
               door behind him.

               MOSS

               Moss pulls three wire hangers off the closet rack. He takes 
               them to the bureau and picks up a sidecutter.

               CHIGURH

               He walks over to the bathroom.

               He turns on its light, looks.

               He leaves the door open. He goes to a closet, opens it, looks. 

               He goes to the door of the room but doesn't open it. He stands 
               with his back against it and looks at the room.

               The bathroom door.

               The closet door.

               Chigurh goes to the bed and sits to take off his boots.

               MOSS

               Moss snips the last of the wire hangers' hooks off with the 
               sidecutter. He wraps the three hooks with duct tape to make 
               a sturdier one.

               He wraps more tape to attach this hook to the end of the 
               three-link pole.

               CHIGURH

               From a bag he withdraws a twelve-gauge automatic shotgun 
               fitted with a silencer big around as a beer can. 

               He checks the loads.

               He picks up the regularly beeping receiver, turns it off, 
               and slips it into his pocket.

               He hoists the air tank.

               MOSS

               He is standing on the chair below the airduct, stooping to 
               pick up the jury-rigged pole leaning nearby. He straightens 
               and feeds the length of the pole into the duct, using the 
               joints to angle it in.

               INT. MOTEL DUCT - NIGHT

               Inside the duct: he watches the pole play in, illuminated by 
               the flashlight he has left resting inside.

               EXT. MOTEL WALKWAY - NIGHT

               STOCKINGED FEET

               We track on the feet padding down the exterior walkway.

               INT. MOTEL DUCT - NIGHT

               MOSS

               Peering along the airduct, both hands up next to one ear 
               awkwardly maneuvering the pole.

               He lays the far, hooked end over the protruding corner of 
               the document case. He pulls.

               The pole slides off the case.

               EXT./INT. 1ST MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               CHIGURH

               He stands at the door of Moss's first room. He eases an ear 
               against it.

               He steps back.

               He punches out the lock cylinder with the airgun and kicks 
               in the door, raising the shotgun.

               A Mexican in a guyabera reclines on one of the two double 
               beds.

               He is scrabbling for a machine pistol on the nightstand. 

               Chigurh fires three times quickly. The damped blasts have 
               the low resonance of chugs into a bottle.

               MOSS

               Head still in the airduct, frozen, listening.

               EXT./INT. 1ST MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               CHIGURH

               Also frozen, back against the wall outside the room, to one 
               side of the open door.

               After a beat he steps back into the open doorway leveling 
               the gun.

               Inside the room: no movement. Much of the man on the bed is 
               spattered against the chewed-up headboard.

               The bathroom door is ajar, its light on.

               A long beat.

               Movement in the wedge of light.

               Immediately, chugs from the shotgun chew up bathroom door 
               and nearby wallboard.

               A cry from inside. A brief chatter of machine pistol.

               INT. MOTEL DUCT - NIGHT

               MOSS'S POV

               Along the air vent.

               The machine-pistol chatter crosses the cut.

               We hear bullets snap through metal. The sound brings on 
               indirect light as holes are punched in the duct somewhere 
               around the bend.

               Moss holds still as the galvanized metal faintly thunders. 
               The flashlight resting on it wobbles.

               EXT./INT. 1ST MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               CHIGURH

               Gun leveled, at the open door.

               Again, no movement.

               He advances into the room, gun pointing at the bathroom door. 
               As he advances he swings the gun briefly over at the closet 
               door and fires. The splintered-in door reveals no occupant. 

               Chigurh angles around the double bed to get a view of that 
               wedge of bathroom floor visible through its door. Blood is 
               pooling out from the right.

               Chigurh fires at the baseboard to the right of the door.

               INT. MOTEL DUCT - NIGHT

               Moss makes another attempt to hook the bag. The hook takes. 

               Moss drags the case inches out into the duct's bend before 
               the hook slides off again.

               INT. 1ST MOTEL ROOM BATHROOM - NIGHT

               CHIGURH

               He uses the shotgun barrel to push open what's left of the 
               bathroom door.

               The mirror over the facing sink gives a view of most of the 
               hidden side of the bedroom/ bathroom party wall. Partial 
               view of a man pressed against the wall, standing in the tub 
               in the corner. From his posture and the one visible hand he 
               seems unarmed.

               Chigurh enters the bathroom.

               The cornered man is unhurt but terrified.  He holds up his 
               hands.

                                     MAN
                         No me mate.

               The man on the floor is quite dead. A machine pistol lies in 
               one out-flung hand. 

               Chigurh looks back up at the survivor.

                                     CHIGURH
                         How'd you find it? 

                                     MAN
                         No me mate.

               Chigurh walks unhurriedly to the tub. The man watches him, 
               hands up, vibrating.

               Chigurh reaches with his free hand and pulls the shower 
               curtain most of the way round, hiding the man. He angles the 
               nose of the shotgun in and fires.

               MOSS

               The hook again snags a strap on the case. Moss pulls, 
               carefully.

               INT. 1ST MOTEL ROOM - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

               Chigurh emerges from the bathroom. His socks are sodden with 
               gore. He sits on the bed and peels them off. He rubs the 
               bottom of each foot with the ankle of each sock and drops 
               the socks to the floor. 

               He rises and opens three bureau drawers, which are empty, 
               and leaves them open.

               He pulls open what remains of the closet door. Empty.

               He looks under the bed.

               He stands, looks around.

               He looks up. His look lingers.

               Close on the airduct grille: it is dusty. Rub-marks have 
               made four dark bands across the dusty slats. Chigurh's fingers 
               rise into frame and meet the grille, roughly aligning with 
               the finger marks in the dust.

               Close on a screwhead: a dime enters and engages the screw 
               and starts turning it.

               INT. MOTEL DUCT - NIGHT

               From inside the duct: fingers reach through the grille and 
               Chigurh's hand pushes it up into the duct, then angles it 
               and withdraws it. Faintly, under the distant airy drone of 
               the compressor, we hear the grate clatter to the floor.

               The back of Chigurh's head appears. He aims a flashlight 
               away down the far length of the duct. A beat.

               He pivots to face us.

               His point-of-view: the length of the duct, empty, with a 
               drag-mark through the middle of the dust.

               Back to Chigurh. His look holds.

               He ducks out.

               INT. 1ST MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               In the room: Chigurh steps down from the chair and pulls the 
               receiver from his pocket and turns it on.

               It beeps once.

               Silence.

               Frowning, looking down at the receiver, Chigurh makes a slow 
               sweep with it. The silence holds-snapped off by car steady 
               as we cut to:

               INT. STATION WAGON - NIGHT

               Moss, with his duffle bag and document case, sits in the 
               passenger seat of an old station wagon. The driver is an 
               elderly man in a yoked shirt.

               After a beat, eyes fixed on the road, the old man shakes his 
               head.

                                     OLD MAN
                         Shouldn't be doin' that. Even a young 
                         man like you.

               Moss gives him a look. A beat.

                                     MOSS
                         Doin' what. The old man gazes at the 
                         road.

                                     OLD MAN
                         Hitchhikin'.

               He shakes his head again. Silent driving. The old man murmurs:

                                     OLD MAN
                         Dangerous.

               EXT. DOWNTOWN HOUSTON - DAY

               BOOMING UP

               We are looking out as a foreground building slips by and we 
               rise to get an ever-higher perspective on downtown Houston, 
               hazy under a noon sun.

               INT. OFFICE - DAY

               A man standing behind a large desk-behind him, floor-to-
               ceiling windows-has no small talk for Carson Wells, the man 
               entering.

                                     MAN
                         You know Anton Chigurh by sight, is 
                         that correct? 

               Carson Wells sits in front of the desk, his manner affable. 
               He rests a booted foot across one knee.

                                     WELLS
                         Yessir, that's correct. I know 'em 
                         when I see 'em.

                                     MAN
                         When did you last see him.

                                     WELLS
                         November the 28th, last year.

                                     MAN
                         You seem pretty sure of the date. 
                         Did I ask you to sit?

                                     WELLS
                         No sir but you struck me as a man 
                         who wouldn't want to waste a chair. 
                         I remember dates. Names. Numbers. I 
                         saw him on November 28th.

               The man gazes. He nods.

                                     MAN
                         We got a loose cannon here. And we're 
                         out a bunch of money, and the other 
                         party is out his product.

                                     WELLS
                         Yessir. I understand that.

               The man looks at him, appraising. He nods again and slides a 
               bank card across the table.

                                     MAN
                         This account will only give up twelve 
                         hundred dollars in any twenty-four 
                         hour period. That's up from a 
                         thousand.

               Wells rises to take the card and then reseats himself.

                                     WELLS
                         Yessir.

                                     MAN
                         If your expenses run higher I hope 
                         you'll trust us for it. 

                                     WELLS
                         Okay.

                                     MAN
                         How well do you know Chigurh.

                                     WELLS
                         Well enough.

                                     MAN
                         That's not an answer.

                                     WELLS
                         What do you want to know? 

                                     MAN
                         I'd just like to know your opinion 
                         of him. In general. Just how dangerous 
                         is he? 

               Wells shrugs.

                                     WELLS
                         Compared to what? The bubonic plague? 
                         He's bad enough that you called me. 
                         He's a psychopathic killer but so 
                         what? There's plenty of them around.

               A beat.

                                     MAN
                         He killed three men in a motel in 
                         Del Rio yesterday. And two others at 
                         that colossal goatfuck out in the 
                         desert.

                                     WELLS
                         Okay. We can stop that.

                                     MAN
                         You seem pretty sure of yourself. 
                         You've led something of a charmed 
                         life haven't you Mr. Wells? 

               Wells rises.

                                     WELLS
                         In all honesty I can't say that charm 
                         has had a whole lot to do with it.

               He thumps once at his chest.

                                     WELLS
                         ...I'm wondering...

                                     MAN
                         Yes? 

                                     WELLS
                         Can I get my parking ticket validated? 

               The man gazes.

                                     MAN
                         ...An attempt at humor, I suppose.

                                     WELLS
                         I'm sorry.

                                     MAN
                         Goodbye, Mr. Wells.

               EXT. EAGLE PASS TOWN SQUARE - DUSK

               Moss is getting out of the station wagon with his duffle and 
               document case.

               It is a town square. Among the old buildings is the Hotel 
               Eagle, identified by a neon above the front door.

               INT. HOTEL EAGLE LOBBY - NIGHT

               Moss enters. Behind the front desk an older man sits reading 
               Ring magazine. He has a hand-rolled cigarette.

                                     MOSS
                         One room, one night.

                                     CLERK
                         That's twenty-six dollars.

                                     MOSS
                         You on all night? 

                                     CLERK
                         Yessir, be here til ten tomorrow 
                         morning.

               Moss pushes a hundred along with smaller bills across the 
               desk.

                                     MOSS
                         For you. I ain't asking you to do 
                         anything illegal.

               The clerk looks at the hundred-dollar bill without reaching. 

                                     CLERK
                         I'm waitin' to hear your description 
                         of that.

                                     MOSS
                         There's somebody lookin' for me. Not 
                         police. Just call me if anyone else 
                         checks in tonight.

               INT. SECOND-FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Moss is mounting the stairs from the lobby. The carpeted 
               hallway is lined by transom-topped doors. Moss goes to a 
               door halfway down on his left.

               INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Moss enters a room with old oak furniture and high ceilings. 
               He sets the document case next to the bed.

               He unzips the duffel and takes out the shotgun which he lays 
               on the bed, and then goes to the window. He parts the curtain 
               to look down.

               The street is empty. Mexican music floats up faintly from a 
               bar somewhere not far away.

               INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER

               The room is dark. The music is gone.

               We are looking straight down on Moss lying, clothed, on the 
               bed. We are booming straight down toward him.

               After a beat he shakes his head.  He opens his eyes, 
               grimacing.

                                     MOSS
                         There just ain't no way.

               He sits up and turns on the bedside lamp.

               The shot gun and document case are on the floor by the bed. 
               Moss swings the document case onto the bed and unclasps it 
               and upends the money onto the bed. He feels the bottom of 
               the case, squeezing it with one hand inside and one hand 
               out, looking for a false bottom. He eyeballs the case, turning 
               it over and around.

               He starts riffling money packets.

               He finds one that binds. It has hundreds on the outside but 
               ones inside with the centers cut out. In the hollow is a 
               sending unit the size of a Zippo lighter.

               He holds the sender, staring at it.

               A long beat.

               From somewhere, a dull chug. The sound is hard to read-a 
               compressor going on, a door thud, maybe something else.

               The sound has brought Moss's look up. He sits listening. No 
               further sound.

               Moss reaches to uncradle the rotary phone by the bed. He 
               dials 0.

               We hear ringing filtered through the handset. Also, faintly, 
               offset, we hear the ring direct from downstairs.

               After five rings Moss cradles the phone.

               He goes to the door, reaches for the knob, but hesitates.

               He gets down on his hands and knees and listens at the crack 
               under the door.

               An open airy sound like a seashell put to your ear.

               Moss rises and turns to the bed. He piles money back into 
               the document case but freezes suddenly-for no reason we can 
               see.

               A long beat on his motionless back. We gradually become aware 
               of a faint high-frequency beeping, barely audible. Its source 
               is indeterminate.

               Moss clasps the document case, picks up his shotgun and eases 
               himself to a sitting position on the bed, facing the door. 

               He looks at the line of light under it.

               The beeps approach, though still not loud. A long wait.

               At length a soft shadow appears in the line of light below 
               the door. It lingers there. The beeping-stops.

               A beat. Now the soft shadow becomes more focused. It resolves 
               into two columns of dark: feet planted before the door.

               Moss raises his shotgun toward the door.

               A long beat.

               Moss adjusts his grip on the shotgun and his finger tightens 
               on the trigger.

               The shadow moves, unhurriedly, rightward. The band of light 
               beneath the door is once again unshadowed.

               Quiet. Moss stares.

               The band of light under the door.

               Moss stares.

               Silently, the light goes out.

               Something for Moss to think about. He stares.

               The hallway behind the door is now dark. The door is defined 
               only from his side, by streetlight-spill through the window. 

               Moss stares. He shifts, starts to rise, doesn't. A beat.

               A report -- not a gunshot, but a stamping sound, followed by 
               a pneumatic hiss.

               It brings a dull impact and Moss recoils, hit.

               He winces, feeling his chest.

               The door is shuddering creakily in.

               It is all strange. Moss gropes in his lap and picks something 
               up. The lock cylinder.

               The creaking door comes to rest, ajar.

               Moss fires. The shotgun blast roars in the confined space 
               and for an instant turns the room orange. The chewed-up door 
               wobbles back against the jamb and creakily bounces in again. 
               Moss has already risen and is hoisting the document case.

               FROM OUTSIDE HIS WINDOW

               Moss finishes draping his shotgun by its strap across his 
               back and climbs out onto the ledge with the document case. 
               He swings the document case out and drops it.

               The bracketing for the hotel's sign gives Moss a handhold. 
               He grabs it as inside the room the door is kicked open. Moss 
               swings down as, with a muted thump, orange muzzleflash strobes 
               the room.

               Moss drops.

               EXT. HOTEL EAGLE SIDEWALK - NIGHT

               Moss lands and grabs the document case and straightens. He 
               is at the hotel entrance, standing in the light coming through 
               the etched glass of the double doors.

               He looks at his own shadow thrown onto the street. He plunges 
               through the doors into the lobby as a gun thumps and crackling 
               shot chews the sidewalk.

               INT. LOBBY - NIGHT

               Moss hurries across the lobby. A glance to one side:

               A booted foot sticks out from behind the front desk.

               Moss slows approaching the stairway. He risks a look around 
               the stairway wall.

               Ascending balusters fade off into the blackness of the second-
               story hallway.

               Moss sags. He looks back across the lobby at the front door. 

               He unhitches his shotgun. He remains still for a moment 
               holding the shotgun, back against the protected side of the 
               wall.

               He quickly swings out and with shotgun aimed up the stairs 
               he crosses to the back lobby.

               He quietly pushes open the back door.

               EXT. SERVICE ALLEY - NIGHT

               OUTSIDE

               Moss emerges into a shallow service alley, dark and dirty. 

               He is at a run when we hear soft tock and a garbage can in 
               front of him snaps and wobbles.

               He turns looking up, backpedaling. Another tock accompanies 
               a muzzleflash in a dark second-story window.

               Moss fires his shotgun: loud. Chips fly off the brickface 
               and the window shatters.

               Moss rounds the alley corner. He stops and squats.

               EXT. DOWNTOWN EAGLE PASS STREET - NIGHT

               Wide: dark, deserted downtown Eagle Pass, Moss a lone figure 
               resting at a corner.

               Close on Moss panting. He takes stock, painfully feeling at 
               his upper chest where the lock hit, then touching gingerly 
               at his side, beneath the ribs, newly bloody. He sighs.

               He listens. No noise. He gets to his feet with the document 
               case in one hand and shotgun in the other. He waits a beat, 
               back against the wall.

               He swings out and fires the shotgun into the alley and then 
               spins back and runs a short block and rounds the next corner 
               and stops to rest.

               EXT. EAGLE PASS STREET - NIGHT

               He waits for his breath to slow. He brings up the shotgun 
               and readies himself.

               He swings out to look back around the corner.

               The street is empty.

               He waits, at the ready for whatever might emerge from the 
               alley mouth a short block away.

               Long beat. Stillness.

               A panicky thought brings his look and the shotgun swinging 
               back around: the man could round the block the other way. 

               Empty street.

               Two empty streets: Moss doesn't know which way to cover, 
               which way to go.

               He stands looking each way, trying to devise a plan. No basis 
               for a plan.

               Quiet hesitation.

               Now, a sound: engine noise.

               An old pickup rounds a corner two blocks up. It rattles toward 
               him.

               Moss lowers the shotgun. He keeps it to the hidden side of 
               his body.

               The pickup dutifully stops at a flashing red traffic light. 

               It comes on through the intersection. 

               Moss strides out into the street. He swings the shotgun up 
               and gives the driver a raised palm to halt.

               INT. PICKUP/EXT. EAGLE PASS STREET - NIGHT

               The truck stops and Moss opens the passenger door and swings 
               the case in and climbs in after.

               The driver, an older man, gapes at him, frightened.

                                     MOSS
                         I'm not going to hurt you. I need 
                         you to --

               The windshield stars.

               A quick second round pushes part of the windshield in.

               Rounds come in without pause, cracking sheet metal, blowing 
               the cab's rear window into the truckbed, twisting the rear-
               view.

               A round seems to have caught the driver in the throat: a 
               gurgling scream as he claws at his windpipe, blowing out 
               blood.

               Moss, quicker to react, has already ducked below the dash.

               A snap of the driver's head and a new freshet of blood from 
               a shot to the head. The screams turn to low gurgles.

               Moss, jammed almost in to the driver's lap, frantically gropes 
               for the shift.

               He throws the pickup into drive and stamps at the accelerator, 
               driving blind as bullets continue to pour in.

               He raises his head enough to see his side-view. It shows 
               sluing, bouncing, empty street, rough guide for steering.

               A tremendous jounce up onto the curb then off it, the driver's 
               body swaying in its restraint.

               The passenger side window shatters: we are passing the gunman. 

               Now Moss sits up to steer looking out front. Behind him 
               through the shot-out back window the dark street is suddenly 
               punctured by muzzleflash. It comes, for the first time, with 
               a report: the low chug of the muted shotgun.

               Rattle of shot against sheet metal.

               Moss floors the gas to roar into a turn. The street sweeping 
               out of view behind him produces one more chugging muzzleflash.

               EXT. EAGLE PASS STREET - NIGHT

               The pickup bounces but Moss, sitting fully up, can now steer.

               He goes half the length of the block and then yanks the wheel 
               hard, braking. The pickup smashes a parked car and jacks 
               around to a halt.

               Moss emerges from the pickup with his shotgun and goes to 
               the sidewalk and backtracks. He covers behind a parked car. 

               He sits leaning back against the car, waiting.

               His point-of-view: his own reflection in the facing 
               storefront, a lot of the driver's blood on him.

               He sinks lower.

               A long beat.

               Footsteps. They approach without hurry.

               A gritty boot turn at the corner. The footsteps come closer 
               still.

               They pass and recede toward the pickup.

               We cut to Chigurh approaching the pickup, shotgun held at 
               ease across his body.

               He slows.

               Moss: he hears the slowing steps.  He tightens his grip on 
               his shotgun and tenses.

               Chigurh: slowing further, he sees:

               Bloody boot prints outside the passenger door.

               Moss rises.

               Chigurh is turning.

               He dives as, behind him, Moss fires.

               Shot peppers two parked cars -- the one Moss rammed and the 
               one behind.

               Chigurh dived between them: hit or not? 

               Moss advances down the middle of the street. He angles his 
               head: anything under the cars? 

               He fires twice. Buckshot claws up the pavement and the car 
               bodies and tires, and the cars sink hissing to their rims.

               Moss crosses to the far curb, still advancing. No one behind 
               the cars.

               He looks up and down the street.

               Nothing to see.

               He goes to the pickup truck, driver's side. He opens the 
               door and reaches over the driver's corpse for his lap belt.

               EXT. EAGLE PASS BORDER AREA - NIGHT

               Deserted.

               The pickup truck rattles into frame.

               Moss emerges. He hoists out the case. He leaves the shotgun. 

               It is very quiet.

               He looks around.

               The Rio Grande bridge.

               Moss walks unsteadily toward it, pressing his free hand to 
               his side.

               A thought stops him. He turns.

               His bloody boot prints point at him like comic book clues. 

               His shoulders sag.

               EXT. RIO GRANDE BRIDGE - NIGHT

               Minutes later. Moss heads down the right-hand walkway in 
               stockinged feet, boots tucked into his belt.

               He turns and looks back toward the U.S. side.

               Empty walkway.

               He proceeds on. Three youths are approaching from the Mexican 
               side. Fart types, they are laughing and walking unsteadily. 

               As they approach they gape at Moss, covered with blood.

               The lead boy, holding a beer, wears a light coat.

                                     MOSS
                         I'll give you five hundred bucks for 
                         your shirt and your coat.

               The three boys stare at him.

               At length:

                                     YOUTH
                         Let's see the money.

               Moss unpeels bills from a moist wad. The top one is bloody. 

                                     SECOND YOUTH
                         ...Were you in a car accident? 

                                     MOSS
                         Yeah.

                                     YOUTH
                         Okay, lemme have the money.

                                     MOSS
                         It's right here. Give me the coat.

                                     YOUTH
                         Lemme hold the money.

               Moss does.

                                     MOSS
                         Gimme the clothes.

               The youth starts to peel them.

                                     MOSS
                         ...And let me have your beer.

                                     YOUTH
                         ...How much? 

                                     SECOND YOUTH
                         Brian. Give him the beer.

               MINUTES LATER

               The boys are receding. Moss pours the beer over his head, 
               rubbing blood away.

               He opens his shirt. He inspects the wounds in his midriff, 
               entrance and exit. Pulsing blood laps weakly out. He shrugs 
               off his shirt, wraps it around his waist and knots it.

               He starts to put on the new shirt. Something stops him. He 
               pauses.

               He vomits into the roadbed.

               He straightens slowly and puts on the new shirt.

               He looks out.

               He is not yet over the river: wind stirs the cane on the 
               bank.

               He looks up: Chain-link fence encloses the walkway to a height 
               of about twelve feet, curling inward at the top.

               He looks down the walkway. The three boys are distant figures. 

               He looks up the walkway.

               A few paces up a light pole stanchion stands flush to the 
               guardrail that separates road and walkway.

               He goes to the stanchion and uses it to hoist himself onto 
               the guardrail, his free hand holding the case.

               Standing on top of the curved metal rail and holding the 
               post for balance, he kneebends down and up and heaves the 
               case.

               It sails clear of the chain-link fence. A short beat and we 
               hear a thump.

               Moss pants for a moment, recovering from the strain of the 
               toss. He eases himself off the guardrail and goes to the 
               fence and looks at the bank below. One gnarled tree stands 
               out in the cane. The case, wherever it landed, is not visible.

               EXT. GUARDSHACK MEXICAN SIDE - NIGHT

               There is a lighted guardshack at the end of the walkway. 
               Inside, a uniformed guard.

               Moss walks unsteadily up. He tilts the beer bottle in salute 
               at the guard.

               The guard impassively lets him proceed.

               EXT. MEXICAN SQUARE - DAWN

               BLACK

               In black, an insanely cheerful mariachi song.

               Fade in on the mariachis. We are looking steeply up at them, 
               dutch-angled. They beam down at us, energetically thumping 
               their oversized guitars and bajo sextos. 

               We boom woozily up and start to un-dutch.

               Reverse on Moss struggling to a sitting position on the park 
               bench where he'd been lying. A public square.

               Back to the mariachis. Beaming, singing.

               Their smiles gradually fade.

               The playing falls off to silence.

               In the silence, birds chirp. The musicians are looking 
               quizzically down.

               Moss's arm swings up in the foreground, extending a bloody 
               hundred-dollar bill.

               On Moss. His coat has swung open to expose his bloody midriff.  
               His look up is glazed.

                                     MOSS
                         Doctor.

               The mariachis stare. Moss waggles the bill.

                                     MOSS
                         ...Medico. Por favor.

               INT. RAMCHARGER/EXT. WAL-MART - DAY

               We are close on a patch of its front seat. Day. The pickup 
               is parked. The piece of upholstery we are looking at has 
               blood soaked into it.

               On the sound of the door opening we cut wider. We are in the 
               parking lot of a Wal-Mart. Chigurh, climbing in, tosses a 
               brown paper bag onto the passenger side. He has a dark towel 
               wrapped around one leg. As he slides behind the wheel the 
               wrapped part of his leg slides over the bloodstain.

               INT. RAMCHARGER/EXT. PHARMACY - DAY

               TRAVELING POINT OF VIEW

               A small-town main street. We are driving past a pharmacy. 

               Chigurh, looking.

               He parks.

               He takes a scissors from the Wal-Mart bag and a box of cotton.  
               He opens the box and cuts a little disc out of the cardboard. 

               He takes a new shirt out of the bag and begins to cut through 
               one sleeve.

               EXT. PHARMACY - DAY

               SHOOTING PAST A PARKED CAR

               Chigurh limps toward us. He holds a coat hanger bent straight 
               with the balled-up shirtsleeve hooked at one end.

               Chigurh arrives, looks up and down the street.

               He unscrews the gas cap, feeds the coat hanger in to soak 
               the shirt, pulls it back out. He tapes the cardboard disc 
               over the open gas tank. He unhooks the wet shirtsleeve and 
               jams it up over the disk. He lights it and exits.

               INSIDE THE PHARMACY - DAY

               A beat pulling Chigurh limping up the aisle, and then the 
               car explodes out front. The plate glass storefront blows in. 

               The few people inside rush out; Chigurh doesn't react.

               The pharmacy counter in back is deserted. Chigurh lifts a 
               hinged piece of counter to enter and starts looking through 
               the stock.

               He pulls out a packet of syringes, Hydrocodone tablets, 
               penicillin.

               INT. SMALL TOWN MOTEL ROOM - DAY

               Chigurh dumps the pharmaceuticals into the bathroom sink.

               In the room outside he sits on the bed and takes off his 
               boots. He unknots the towel from around his leg and stands 
               and unbuttons his pants and starts cutting from the crotch 
               down with a heavy scissors. One thigh is a mess of clotted 
               blood and torn fabric.

               INT. MOTEL BATHROOM - DAY

               BATH

               Chigurh lowers himself into bath water that quickly turns 
               pink. He laves water over his bloody thigh. There is a dark 
               red hole, one half inch across, pulsing blood into the bath 
               water Torn pieces of fabric from his pants are embedded in 
               the bleeding skin.

               A SHAVING MIRROR

               We are looking at the wound in a magnifying mirror. Forceps 
               enter and pluck a tiny piece of blood-soaked fabric from the 
               skin.

               RUNNING WATER

               A bathroom tap. The forceps enter. They are rinsed, shaken 
               off.

               Wider: Chigurh sits on the closed toilet with the mirror 
               sitting on the edge of the tub, angled toward the wound. 
               Chigurh works on cleaning it.

               INT. SMALL TOWN MOTEL ROOM - DAY

               The main room. The TV is on now. Chigurh enters from the 
               bathroom with his leg bandaged. He sits on the bed and tears 
               open the packaging of a syringe. 

               He plunges it into an ampule of penicillin.

               He injects himself.

               INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY

               Sheriff Bell sits writing in a large leatherette checkbook. 
               He projects:

               A loud truck-by from the street outside. Sheriff Bell's eyes 
               track the passing vehicle.

               Sanderson outskirts.

               Sheriff Bell passes a flatbed truck with a flapping tarp and 
               briefly blurps his siren to pull it over. He parks on the 
               shoulder in front of the truck and then walks back to the 
               driver who watches his approach, chewing gum with blithe 
               unconcern.

                         Oh. One of the tiedowns worked lose.

               Bell whips the tarp back to expose eight corpses wrapped 
               blue sheeting bound with tape.

                                     BELL

               Sheriff Bell pulls the tarp down and ties it. The driver 
               watches without helping.

                                     DRIVER

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

               Moss, in bed, stirs at an off screen voice:

               Moss blearily focuses on:

               A fancy crocodile boot.

               His look rises from the boot, crossed on his visitor's knee, 
               up to the man's face. 

               Carson Wells smiles at him from the bedside chair.

                         whiskey and the rest of it I just 
                         sort of blew it in. 

               Wells' smile stays in place.

                                     WELLS
                         How do you know he's not on his way 
                         to Odessa? 

               Moss stares at him. A beat.

                                     MOSS
                         Why would he go to Odessa? 

                                     WELLS
                         To kill your wife.

               Another beat.

                                     MOSS
                         Maybe he should be worried. About 
                         me.

                                     WELLS
                         He isn't. You're not cut out for 
                         this. You're just a guy that happened 
                         to find those vehicles. 

               Moss doesn't respond.

                                     WELLS
                         ...You didn't take the product, did 
                         you?

                                     MOSS
                         What product.

                                     WELLS
                         The heroin. You don't have it.

                                     MOSS
                         No I don't have it.

                                     WELLS
                         No. You don't.

               He rises.

                                     WELLS
                         ...I'm across the river. At the Hotel 
                         Eagle. Carson Wells.  Call me when 
                         you've had enough. I can even let 
                         you keep a little of the money.

                                     MOSS
                         If I was cuttin' deals, why wouldn't 
                         I go deal with this guy Chigurh?

                                     WELLS
                         No no. No. You don't understand. You 
                         can't make a deal with him. Even if 
                         you gave him the money he'd still 
                         kill you. He's a peculiar man. You 
                         could even say that he has principles. 
                         Principles that transcend money or 
                         drugs or anything like that. He's 
                         not like you. He's not even like me. 

                                     MOSS
                         He don't talk as much as you, I give 
                         him points for that.

               INT. COFFEE SHOP - ODESSA - DAY

               Sheriff Bell rises from a booth, taking off his hat.

               She sits. He sits.

                         Don't know why I did. I told you, I

                         I wish I could say that was in his

                         think it is.

                         He can take all comers.

               Bell looks at her. After a beat:

                                     BELL

               Indicates between his own eyes.

                                     BELL
                         ...and then truss 'em up and slit

                         one trussed up and all set to drain 
                         him and the beef comes to. It starts 
                         thrashing around, six hundred pounds 
                         of very pissed-off livestock if you'll 
                         pardon my... Charlie grabs his gun 
                         there to shoot the damn thing in the 
                         head but what with the swingin' and 
                         twistin' it's a glance-shot and 
                         ricochets around and comes back hits 
                         Charlie in the shoulder. You go see 
                         Charlie, he still can't reach up 
                         with his right hand for his hat... 
                         Point bein', even in the contest 
                         between man and cow the issue is not 
                         certain.

               He takes a sip of coffee, leaving room for Carla Jean to 
               argue if inclined.

               She does not.

               Sheriff Bell hands a card across.

               She takes the card. Sheriff Bell sips.

                                     BELL
                         ...Course, they slaughter beeves

                         brain...

               He holds thumb and forefinger a couple inches apart.

                                     BELL
                         ...Sucks back in. Animal never knows 
                         what hit him.

               Another beat. Carla Jean stares at him.

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         Why you tellin' me that, Sheriff? 

                                     BELL
                         I don't know. My mind wanders.

               EXT. RIO GRANDE BRIDGE - AFTERNOON

               Late Day.

               Carson Wells grabs a light pole stanchion to hoist himself 
               onto the guardrail. He stands atop it, eyeing the chain-link 
               fence across the walkway. 

               He climbs down and crosses to the fence and looks down:

               The brown, sluggish water of the Rio Grande.

               LOOKING DOWN THE WALKWAY

               Carson Wells enters frame and recedes down the walkway.  
               When he draws even with the next stanchion he looks down 
               through the fence:

               Cane on the riverbank, and one gnarled tree.

               INT. HOTEL EAGLE LOBBY - NIGHT

               Twilight. Carson Wells enters the hotel and crosses the lobby.

               INT. STAIRWAY - NIGHT

               Carson Wells appears around the corner and we pull him as he 
               mounts the stairs.  When he is about halfway up a figure -- 
               focus does not hold him -- rounds the corner behind and 
               silently follows, holding a fat-barreled shotgun loosely at 
               his side.

               After a few steps Carson Wells stops, frowning, cued by we 
               don't know what. Focus drops back as he turns. Chigurh raises 
               the shotgun.

                                     CHIGURH
                         Hello Carson. Let's go to your room.

               2ND HOTEL EAGLE ROOM - NIGHT

               Chigurh sits into a chair drawn up to face the armchair where 
               Carson Wells sits.

                                     WELLS
                         We don't have to do this. I'm a 
                         daytrader. I could just go home.

                                     CHIGURH
                         Why would I let you do that? 

                                     WELLS
                         I know where the money is.

                                     CHIGURH
                         If you knew, you would have it with 
                         you.

                                     WELLS
                         I need dark. To get it. I know where 
                         it is.

                                     CHIGURH
                         I know something better.

                                     WELLS
                         What's that.

                                     CHIGURH
                         I know where it's going to be.

                                     WELLS
                         And where is that.

                                     CHIGURH
                         It will be brought to me and placed 
                         at my feet.

               Wells wipes his mouth with his hand.

                                     WELLS
                         You don't know to a certainty. Twenty 
                         minutes it could be here.

                                     CHIGURH
                         I do know to a certainty. And you 
                         know what's going to happen now. You 
                         should admit your situation. There 
                         would be more dignity in it.

                                     WELLS
                         You go to hell.

               A beat.

                                     CHIGURH
                         Let me ask you something. If the 
                         rule you followed brought you to 
                         this, of what use was the rule?

               Another beat.

                                     WELLS
                         Do you have any idea how goddamn 
                         crazy you are? 

                                     CHIGURH
                         You mean the nature of this 
                         conversation? 

                                     WELLS
                         I mean the nature of you.

               Chigurh looks at him equably. Wells holds his look.

                                     WELLS
                         ...You can have the money. Anton.

               The phone rings.

               Wells looks at the phone. Chigurh hasn't moved.

               Wells looks at Chigurh, waiting for a decision.

               The low chug of the shotgun.

               Aside from his finger on the trigger, Chigurh hasn't moved. 
               He sits staring at Wells's remains for a beat.

               Now his look swings onto the phone. He watches it ring twice 
               more.

               He picks it up and listens without speaking.

               After a beat:

                                     MOSS'S VOICE
                         ...Hello?

                                     CHIGURH
                         Yes? 

               Another beat.

                                     MOSS'S VOICE
                         Is Carson Wells there.

               A longer beat.

                                     CHIGURH
                         Not in the sense that you mean.

               Moss doesn't answer. Chigurh gives him a beat, and then:

                                     CHIGURH
                         ...You need to come see me.

               MEXICAN HOSPITAL WARD - NIGHT

               We intercut Moss, in his hospital robe, at a public phone on 
               the ward. He stands tensed with the phone to his ear. Finally: 

                                     MOSS
                         Who is this.

                                     CHIGURH
                         You know who it is.

               A beat.

                                     CHIGURH
                         ...You need to talk to me.

                                     MOSS
                         I don't need to talk to you.

                                     CHIGURH
                         I think that you do. Do you know 
                         where I'm going?

                                     MOSS
                         Why would I care where you're going.

                                     CHIGURH
                         Do you know where I'm going? 

               No answer.

               INT. 2ND HOTEL EAGLE ROOM - NIGHT

               Chigurh cocks his head, noticing something on the floor. He 
               adjusts to sit back and raise his boots onto the bed.

               On the floor where his feet were, blood is pooling out from 
               Wells's chair.

                                     CHIGURH
                         ...I know where you are.

                         You're in the hospital across the 
                         river. But that's not where I'm going. 
                         Do you know where I'm going? 

                                     MOSS
                         Yeah. I know where you're going.

                                     CHIGURH
                         All right.

                                     MOSS
                         You know she won't be there.

                                     CHIGURH
                         It doesn't make any difference where 
                         she is.

                                     MOSS
                         So what're you goin' up there for.

               A beat.

                                     CHIGURH
                         You know how this is going to turn 
                         out, don't you? 

                                     MOSS
                         No. Do you? 

                                     CHIGURH
                         Yes, I do. I think you do too. So 
                         this is what I'll offer. You bring 
                         me the money and I'll let her go. 
                         Otherwise she's accountable. The 
                         same as you. That's the best deal 
                         you're going to get. I won't tell 
                         you you can save yourself because 
                         you can't.

                                     MOSS
                         Yeah I'm goin' to bring you somethin' 
                         all right. I've decided to make you 
                         a special project of mine. You ain't 
                         goin' to have to look for me at all.

               Moss slams the phone onto its hook, then slams it twice more 
               for good measure.

               Chigurh, in the hotel room, cradles his phone.

               INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

               Sheriff Bell sits at his usual booth, but with an unaccustomed 
               look: reading glasses. He has been looking at a newspaper 
               but is now peering over his glasses up at Wendell who 
               apparently interrupted his reading.

                                     BELL

                         There's a question. Whether they 
                         stopped bein'. And when.

                         Yessir.

                         Now, Wendell, did you inquire about 
                         the cylinder lock?

                                     WENDELL
                         Yessir. It was punched out.

                         No, that's the only thing I would've 
                         looked for. And it sounds like these 
                         boys died of natural causes.

                                     WENDELL
                         How's that, Sheriff?

                         war. I  don't know any other word 
                         for it. Who are these folks? I don't 
                         know...

               He rattles the paper.

                                     BELL
                         ...Here last week they found this

                         and here I quote...

               He looks through his glasses at the paper.

                                     BELL
                         ..."Neighbors were alerted when a

                         to even try.

               He peers over his glasses at Wendell who respectfully shakes 
               his head and tsks.

               Sheriff Bell rattles the paper again.

                                     BELL
                         ...But that's what it took, you'll

                         bring any.

               Wendell bites back a smile. Sheriff Bell gazes at him over 
               his glasses for a long beat, deadpan.

                                     BELL
                         ...That's all right. I laugh myself 
                         sometimes.

               He goes back to the paper.

                                     BELL
                         ...There ain't a whole lot else you

               EXT. BORDER SHACK - DAY

               Moss, a coat thrown over his hospital robe, is standing before 
               a uniformed INS official on the Rio Grande bridge.

               The official, who looks like a marine drill instructor, is 
               chewing. He chews for a long beat, staring at Moss.

               He finally spits tobacco juice and pats his lower lip with a 
               handkerchief.

               EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY

               We are looking across the Rio Grande. Moss appears over the 
               near edge of the river bank, newly clothed, and holding the 
               document case.

               As he reaches the top of the bank he frowns and twists his 
               neck, responding to an irritation. He feels around with his 
               free hand inside the back of the shirt collar. A sharp yank. 

               His hand comes away with a small tag.

               INT. GREYHOUND STATION - DEL RIO - DAY

               The document case is resting on a small foreground counter.

               Moss is at a pay phone, one hand holding the phone to his 
               ear, the other resting on the case.

               The voice on the phone is old, female, and querulous:

                         She don't want to talk to you.

                                     MOSS
                         Yes she does. Put her on.

                                     VOICE
                         Do you know what time it is? 

                                     MOSS
                         I don't care what time it is. Don't 
                         you hang up this phone.

                                     VOICE
                         I told her what was going to happen, 
                         didn't I. Chapter and verse. I said: 
                         This is what will come to pass. And 
                         now it has come to pass --

               Scuffing sounds, a sharp "Mama!", and then, into the phone: 

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         Llewelyn?

                         What should I do?

                         What did I know to tell him. You're 
                         hurt, ain't you?

                         I can hear it in your voice.

                         No. This works better. With you gone 
                         and I don't have the money, he can't 
                         touch me. But I can sure touch him. 
                         After I find him I'll come and join

               OFFICE HALLWAY - DAY

               A LOCK CYLINDER

               It blows in. The hole shows a brightly lit cinderblock wall 
               behind.

               The door swings open and the air tank is swung in and 
               deposited on carpet.

               Wider: Chigurh enters the carpeted hallway from the 
               cinderblock stairwell, holding the tricked-out shotgun.

               The hallway is white wallboard, doors opening off it at long 
               intervals. Chigurh stands still and listens. Nothing but the 
               hum of ventilation.

               He walks quietly to the one open door twenty feet away.

               INT. OFFICE - DAY

               He enters.

               The man who hired Carson Wells is behind his desk, in front 
               of the floor-to-ceiling windows. He looks up from papers, 
               slipping off his reading glasses. On seeing the shotgun he 
               opens a desk drawer and starts to rise.

               Chung -- the shotgun blast knocks him back. Shot pits but 
               doesn't break the window.

               A man in a suit rises and turns from the chair opposite the 
               desk, very slowly, as if to advertise that he is not a threat. 

               Chigurh ignores him and rounds the desk to look at the man 
               gurgling on the floor.

               After a beat, still looking down at the man he has shot:

                                     CHIGURH
                         Who are you? 

               A long beat.

                                     MAN AT CHAIR
                         ...Me? 

                                     CHIGURH
                         Yes.

                                     MAN AT CHAIR
                         Nobody. Accounting.

               Chigurh finally looks up at him.

                                     CHIGURH
                         He gave Acosta's people a receiver.

                                     MAN AT CHAIR
                         He feels... he felt... the more people 
                         looking...

                                     CHIGURH
                         That's foolish. You pick the one 
                         right tool.

               Chigurh inclines his head toward the pocked glass of the 
               picture window.

                                     CHIGURH
                         ...For instance. I used birshot. So 
                         as not to blow the window.

                                     MAN AT CHAIR
                         I see.

               He still has not moved, one hand still touching the armrest.

                                     MAN AT CHAIR
                         ...Are you going to shoot me?

               Chigurh looks at him.

                                     CHIGURH
                         That depends. Do you see me? 

               The man stares at him for a beat.

                                     MAN AT CHAIR
                         No.

               INT. CAB - ODESSA - DAY

               EYES IN A REAR-VIEW MIRROR

               Eyes in a weathered face shift back and forth between road 
               and mirror, where they give nodding acknowledgment to the 
               passenger.

                                     MOTHER'S VOICE
                         And I always seen this is what it 
                         would come to. Three years ago I pre-
                         visioned it.

               Wider shows Carla Jean and her mother in the back of the

                         Three years ago I said them very 
                         words. No and Good.

                                     DRIVER
                         Yes ma'am.

                         I got the cancer. And look at this. 
                         Not even a home to go to.

                                     DRIVER
                         Yes ma'am.

                                     MOTHER
                         We're goin' to El Paso Texas. You 
                         know how many people I know in El

                                     DRIVER
                         No ma'am.

               She holds up thumb and forefinger curled to make an 0.

                                     MOTHER
                         That's how many. Ninety degree heat.

               EXT. BUS STATION - ODESSA - DAY

               The cab is stopped outside the depot. Carla Jean and her 
               mother and the driver are at the trunk struggling over bags. 

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         I got it Mama.

                                     MOTHER
                         I didn't see my Prednizone.

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         I put it in, Mama.

                                     MOTHER
                         Well I didn't see it.

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         Well I put it in. That one. You just 
                         set there. I'll get tickets and a 
                         cart for the bags.

               As Carla Jean goes to the station a man emerges from a car 
               pulled up behind. He is a well-dressed Mexican of early middle 
               age.

                                     MEXICAN
                         Do you need help with the bags, madam?

                         son-in-law. Thank you. You don't 
                         often see a Mexican in a suit.

                         You go to El Paso? I know it. Where 
                         are you staying?

               INT. BUS STATION - DAY

               Carla Jean is at a phone booth.

               After a short wait, a pickup and a filtered:

                         Carla Jean, how are you.

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         Sheriff, was that a true story about 
                         Charlie Walser?

                         Who's Charlie Walser. Oh! Well, I, 
                         uh... True story? I couldn't swear 
                         to ever detail but... it's certainly 
                         true that it is a story.

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         Yeah, right. Sheriff, can you give 
                         me your word on somethin'?

               SHERIFF BELL'S OFFICE - DAY

               We intercut Sheriff Bell in his office.

                         Llewelyn would never ask for help. 
                         He never thinks he needs any.

               EXT. ROAD - DAY

               CHIGURH

               A driving point-of-view approaching Chigurh, who leans against 
               his Ramcharger, its hood up, stopped on the shoulder on the 
               opposite side of the road.

               Reverse shows a man in an El Camino. Chickens in stacked 
               cages squawk and flutter in the bed.

               The man slows and rolls his window down to lean out.

                                     MAN
                         What's the problem there, neighbor.

               MINUTES LATER

               The man has pulled his vehicle over nose-to-nose with 
               Chigurh's. He is rummaging in the car behind the seat. His 
               voice comes out muffled:

                                     MAN
                         Yeah, that'll suck some power. Over

                                     CHIGURH
                         You from around here? 

               The man emerges with jumper cables.

                                     MAN
                         Alpine. Born 'n bred. Here ya go.

               He hands one pair of leads to Chigurh.

                                     CHIGURH
                         What airport would you use.

                                     MAN
                         Huh? Airport or airstrip? 

                                     CHIGURH
                         Airport.

                                     MAN
                         Well -- where ya goin'? 

                                     CHIGURH
                         I don't know.

                                     MAN
                         Just lightin' out for the territories, 
                         huh. Brother, I been there... Well...

               He takes off his hat and draws a sleeve across his brow, 
               thinking.

                                     MAN
                         ...There's airstrips.

               He turns with his pair of leads to clamp them onto his 
               battery. On his back:

                                     MAN
                         ...The airport is El Paso. You want 
                         some place specific you might could 
                         be better off just drivin' to Dallas. 
                         Not have to connect.

               He turns back around to face Chigurh who stands there, still 
               holding his pair of leads.

                                     MAN
                         ...You gonna clamp them, buddy?

               Chigurh is looking at him blandly.

                                     CHIGURH
                         Can you get those chicken crates out 
                         of the bed.

               The man stares at him.

                                     MAN
                         What're you talkin' about?

               EXT. CAR WASH - DAY

               COIN SLOT

               Quarters are fed in. Wider as Chigurh unholsters the wand at 
               a self-service car wash.

               He sprays the spatter-pattern rust-colored stain off the 
               roof of the cab of the El Camino.

               Water drums as he sprays chicken feathers out of the bed.

               EXT. MOTEL - EL PASO - DAY

               Moss is turning the key in his room door, a new vinyl gun 
               bag slung over his shoulder.

               At the cut the roar of a plane climbing overhead recedes. 
               Out of it, a voice:

                                     WOMAN
                         Hey Mr. Sporting Goods.

               Moss looks.

               A woman sunbathes at the central court swimming pool. A lot 
               of hard light.

                                     MOSS
                         Hey yourself.

               The woman is pretty in a roadhouse-veteran sort of way. Her 
               voice carries a flat echo, slapping off the surface of the 
               pool.

                                     WOMAN
                         You a sport? 

               Moss slings the bag into the room onto the bed and then turn 
               and leans against a veranda post.

                                     MOSS
                         That's me.

                                     WOMAN
                         I got beers in my room.

               Moss holds up his left hand to show the ring.

                                     MOSS
                         Waitin' for my wife.

                                     WOMAN
                         Oh. That's who you keep lookin' out 
                         the window for? 

                                     MOSS
                         Half.

                                     WOMAN
                         What else then? 

                                     MOSS
                         Lookin' for what's comin'.

                                     WOMAN
                         Yeah but no one ever sees that. I 
                         like a man that'll tell you he's 
                         married.

                                     MOSS
                         Then you'll like me.

                                     WOMAN
                         I do like you.

               A beat. Lapping water.

                                     WOMAN
                         ...Beer. That's what's comin', I'll 
                         bring the ice chest out here. You 
                         can stay married.

               Building jet roar from another climbing plane.

                                     MOSS
                         Ma'am I know what beer leads to.

               The woman laughs. Before the plane overwhelms it:

                                     WOMAN
                         Beer leads to more beer.

               INT. SHERIFF BELL'S CRUISER - DAY

               SHERIFF BELL

               Driving.

               As he drives he refers to one side of the road, a commercial 
               strip, looking for something. We hear the fading roar of a 
               large airplane.

               The tock tock of distant gunfire brings his look around. A 
               beat. Another tock. The chatter of machine-gun fire. Another 
               single shot.

               Sheriff Bell stamps the accelerator and hits his siren.

               EXT. MOTEL STREET - DAY

               Point-of-view racing toward the motel: a pickup with a rack 
               of roof lights roars out. Tire squeals, machine-gun chatter 
               and dog barks. The truck turns toward us, then slews around 
               and speeds away, fishtailing.

               EXT. MOTEL COURTYARD - DAY

               Point-of-view turning into the central court: a man is 
               crawling on his belly along the veranda toward the street. 

               Sheriff Bell skids to a halt and gets out. We hear screams, 
               a child crying.

               Sheriff Bell jogs toward the crawling man, one hand on his 
               holstered gun.

               Behind the man on the veranda is his abandoned machine pistol.  
               He is a Mexican in a guyabera.

               Sheriff Bell yells at a scared face in a cracked door:

                                     BELL
                         Call police.

               He is still jogging. A glance to the side:

               Rough point-of-view of a woman's body, belly-down at the lip 
               of the pool, head and upper torso in the water.

               Rough point-of-view forward: an open room door. Booted feet 
               stick out.

               Sheriff Bell arrives. Moss is face-up, mostly inside the 
               room.  The new gun bag is next to him. The gun is in hand. 
               He is still.

               Voices. Sheriff Bell glances off.

                                     BELL
                         ...Call your local law enforcement. 
                         I'm not on their radio.

               EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT

               Night. The entrance is blocked by police vehicles.

               People stand around in knots. Sheriff Bell is talking to the 
               local sheriff. A door slam attracts his look.

               Carla Jean has gotten out of the far side of a cab. On the 
               near side the driver is leaning in to help her mother out. 
               After a couple of rocking attempts she has enough inertia to 
               come to her feet outside the vehicle.

               Carla Jean is advancing slowly toward Sheriff Bell, taking 
               in the scene.

               Sheriff Bell steps toward her.

               Her eyes track his hand as he raises it to his hat. He takes 
               it off.

                                     BELL
                         Carla Jean...

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         No.

               INT. HOSPITAL/MORGUE - NIGHT

               Looking down a long corridor flanked by a wall of stainless 
               steel drawers. At the far end stands Bell, hat in hand, 
               staring down into an open drawer just in front of him. A 
               long beat.

               EXT. HOSPITAL / MORGUE - NIGHT

               The local sheriff, Roscoe Giddins, stands smoking under the 
               port cochere in front of the hospital. Sheriff Bell emerges 
               from the building.

               A long beat.

                                     BELL
                         I don't know who she is.

               He puts his hat back on.

                         Yes, he has some hard bark on him.

                         That don't hardly say it. He shoots 
                         the desk clerk one day, and walks 
                         right back in the next and shoots a 
                         retired army colonel.

               They have reached Sheriff Bell's cruiser and he sits in. 

                                     BELL
                         Hard to believe.

                                     ROSCOE
                         Strolls right back into a crime scene. 
                         Who would do such a thing? How do 
                         you defend against it? 

               Roscoe closes the door for Sheriff Bell.

                                     ROSCOE
                         ...Good trip Ed Tom. I'm sorry we 
                         couldn't help your boy.

               He is walking away.

               Sheriff Bell sits thinking in the cruiser. He makes no move 
               for the ignition. 

               A long beat.

               EXT. MOTEL

               Now very late, empty of onlookers and emergency vehicles. 

               Sheriff Bell's cruiser pulls up just inside the courtyard. 
               He cuts his engine.

               Sheriff Bell sits looking at the motel.

               Very quiet. After a long beat he gets out of the car. He 
               pushes its door shut quietly, with two hands.

               He looks up the veranda.

               The one door, most of the way up, has yellow tape across it. 
               Its loose ends wave in a light breeze.

               Sheriff Bell looks up the street.

               Nothing much to attract his attention.

               EXT. MOTEL VERANDA

               Sheriff Bell steps up onto the veranda. He takes slow, quiet 
               steps.

               We intercut his point-of-view, nearing the door marked by 
               police tape.

               As he draws close to the door he slows.

               The yellow tape is about chest high. Above it is the lock 
               cylinder.  It has been punched hollow.

               Sheriff Bell stands staring at the lock.

               Very quiet. The chick, chick, of the tape-ends against the 
               door frame.

               Still.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM

               INSIDE

               Chigurh is still also. Just on the other side of the door, 
               he stands holding his shotgun.

               From inside, the tap of the breeze-blown tape is dulled but 
               perceptible. It counts out beats.

               Chigurh is also looking at the lock cylinder.

               The curved brass of its hollow interior holds a reflection 
               of the motel room exterior. Lights and shapes. The curvature 
               distorts to unrecognizability what is reflected, but we see 
               the color of Sheriff Bell's uniform.

               The reflection is very still. Then, slow movement.

               OUTSIDE

               Sheriff Bell finishes bringing his hand to his holstered 
               gun. It rests there.

               Still once again.

               His point-of-view of the lock. The reflection from here, 
               darker, is hard to read.

               INSIDE

               Chigurh, still.

               OUTSIDE

               Sheriff Bell, his hand on his holstered gun. A long beat. 

               His hand drops.

               He extends one booted toe. He nudges the door inward.

               As the lock cylinder slowly recedes, reflected shapes scramble 
               inside it and slide up its curve. Before the door is fully 
               open we cut around:

               FROM INSIDE

               The door finishes creaking open. Sheriff Bell is a silhouette 
               in the doorway. 

               A still beat.

               At length Sheriff Bell ducks under the chest-high police 
               tape to enter.

               The worn carpet has a large dark stain that glistens near 
               the door. Sheriff Bell steps over it, advancing slowly. The 
               room is dimly lit shapes.

               There is a bathroom door in the depth of the room. Sheriff 
               Bell advances toward it. He stops in front of it.

               He toes the door. It creaks slowly open.

               INT. MOTEL BATHROOM

               The bathroom, with no spill light from outside, is pitch 
               black.

               Sheriff Bell reaches slowly up with one hand. He gropes at 
               the inside wall.

               The light goes on: bright. White tile. Sheriff Bell squints.  
               A beat.

               He takes a step in.

               He looks at the small window.

               He looks at the window's swivel-catch, locked.

               INT. MAIN ROOM

               Sheriff Bell emerges from the bathroom. He sits heavily onto 
               the bed.

               He looks around, not for anything in particular. His look 
               catches on something low, just in front of him:

               A ventilation duct near the baseboard. Its opening is exposed; 
               its grille lies on the floor before it.

               Sheriff Bell stares.

               At length he leans forward. He nudges the grille aside. On 
               the floor, a couple of screws. A coin.

               EXT. WEST TEXAS CABIN - DAY

               A CAT

               Licking itself on a plank floor, stiffened leg pointing out. 

               It suddenly stops and looks up, ears perked.

               A frozen beat, and then it bolts.

               The camera booms up to frame the barren west Texas landscape 
               outside the window of this isolated cabin. A pickup truck is 
               approaching, trailing dust. The cat reenters frame outside, 
               running across the rutted gravel in front of the house as 
               the pickup slows.

               Sheriff Bell stares at him.

                         You're discouraged.

                                     BELL
                         I'm... discouraged.

                                     ELLIS
                         You can't stop what's comin. Ain't 
                         all waitin' on you.

               The two men look at each other. Ellis shakes his head.

                                     ELLIS
                         ...That's vanity.

               After a beat, a fast fade.

               EXT. GRAVESITE - ODESSA - DAY

               In black we hear the chink-chink-chink of chain being played 
               out and the hum of a motor.

               We cut to a dark foreground shape being lowered in sync with 
               the clinking sound. As it drops it clears a tombstone 
               Progressively revealed:

               The name, Agnes Kracik.

               Her dates: 1922-1980.

               The inscription: Beloved Mother.

               Off that we cut to Carla Jean, standing by in a black dress 
               and dark veil.

               EXT. A SMALL SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY

               A parched square of grass in front of the house. A rusty 
               station wagon pulls into the driveway and stops. Carla Jean 
               gets out.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Carla Jean enters and puts on the kettle. She opens the 
               cupboard looking for something.

               KITCHEN - LATER

               Carla Jean sits at the kitchen table drinking tea. She looks 
               out the window.

               Across the street kids are running through a sprinkler that 
               chugs in the yard.

               INT. BEDROOM

               BEDROOM DOOR

               The door opens and Carla Jean enters holding her hat and 
               veil. She throws the light switch and stops, hand frozen, 
               looking into the room.

               After a beat:

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         I knew this wasn't done with.

               Chigurh sits at the far end of the room in the late-afternoon 
               shadows.

                                     CHIGURH
                         No.

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         I ain't got the money.

                                     CHIGURH
                         No.

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         What little I had is long gone and 
                         they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I 
                         buried my mother today. I ain't paid 
                         for that neither.

                                     CHIGURH
                         I wouldn't worry about it.

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         ...I need to sit down.

               Chigurh nods at the bed and Carla Jean sits down, hugging 
               her hat and veil.

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         ...You got no cause to hurt me.

                                     CHIGURH
                         No. But I gave my word.

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         You gave your word? 

                                     CHIGURH
                         To your husband.

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         That don't make sense. You gave your 
                         word to my husband to kill me? 

                                     CHIGURH
                         Your husband had the opportunity to 
                         remove you from harm's way. Instead, 
                         he used you to try to save himself.

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         Not like that. Not like you say.

                                     CHIGURH
                         I don't say anything. Except it was 
                         foreseen.

               A beat.

                                     CARLA JEAN
                         I knowed you was crazy when I saw 
                         you settin' there. I knowed exactly 
                         what was in store for me.

                                     CHIGURH
                         Yes. Things fall into place.

               EXT. HOUSE

               Minutes later.

               A beat.

               The front door swings open and Chigurh emerges.

               He pauses with one hand on the jamb and looks at the sole of 
               each boot in turn.

               He goes to the pickup in the driveway.

               INT. PICKUP/EXT. INTERSECTION - A MINUTE LATER

               He is driving.

               His point-of-view: coming upon an empty intersection, his 
               light green.

               Back to Chigurh.

               He just starts to turn his head to the right.

               A huge crash.

               EXT. INTERSECTION

               Chigurh's pickup has been T-boned by an old crate of  a 
               pickup. Both vehicles slide to a halt amid broken glass in 
               the middle of the intersection.

               The windshield of the truck that ran the light is mostly 
               gone. The driver is draped dead on the wheel.

               After a beat the door of Chigurh's truck is pushed open. He 
               staggers out, heavily favoring one leg where the jeans are 
               shredded and bloody at the thigh. One arm is also bloody and 
               hangs limp. Blood runs down his face from a scalp wound.

               He staggers to a lawn and sits.

               He looks up.

               Two teenage boys have come out of somewhere. They goggle at 
               him.

                                     BOY 1
                         Mister there's a bone stickin' out 
                         of your arm.

                                     CHIGURH
                         I'm all right. Let me just sit here 
                         a minute.

                                     BOY 2
                         There's an ambulance comin. Man over 
                         yonder went to call. 

                                     CHIGURH
                         All right.

                                     BOY 1
                         Are you all right? You got a bone 
                         stickin' out of your arm. 

                                     CHIGURH
                         What will you take for that shirt? 

               The two boys look at each other. They look back.

                                     BOY 2
                         What shirt? 

                                     CHIGURH
                         Any damn shirt. I need something to 
                         wrap around my head and I need a 
                         sling for this arm.

               Boy 2 unbuttons his shirt.

                                     BOY 2
                         Hell mister, I'll give you my shirt.

               Chigurh uses his teeth to clamp the shirt and rips it and 
               wraps a swatch around his head. He twists the rest of the 
               shirt into a sling and puts the limp arm in.

                                     BOY 1
                         Look at that fuckin' bone.

                                     CHIGURH
                         Tie this for me.

               The two boys look at each other.

                                     CHIGURH
                         ...Just tie it.

               Boy 2, the one now wearing a T-shirt, ties it.

               Chigurh pulls a bill clip from his pocket and draws a bill 
               out with his teeth. He holds it out to the boy.

                                     BOY 2
                         Hell mister, I don't mind helpin' 
                         somebody out. That's a lot of money.

                                     CHIGURH
                         Take it. Take it and you didn't see 
                         me. I was already gone. 

                                     BOY 2
                         Yessir.

               Wide on Chigurh limping off.

               We can just hear the boys, small:

                                     BOY 1
                         Part of that's mine.

                                     BOY 2
                         You still got your damn shirt.

                                     BOY 1
                         That ain't what it was for.

                                     BOY 2
                         Maybe, but I'm still out a shirt.

               INT. BELL'S KITCHEN - DAY

               Loretta pours Sheriff Bell and then herself morning coffee. 

                                     BELL
                         Maybe I'll go ridin.

                                     LORETTA

                         I mean, would you care to join me.

                                     LORETTA
                         Lord no. I'm not retired.

               A beat.

               Sheriff Bell sips his coffee.

                                     BELL
                         Maybe I'll help here then.

               A beat.

               Loretta takes a sip.

                                     LORETTA
                         Better not.

               They both sip.

                                     LORETTA
                         ...How'd you sleep?

                         concerned.

                         Ed Tom, I'll be polite.

                                     BELL
                         Okay. Two of 'em. Both had my father. 
                         It's peculiar. I'm older now'n he 
                         ever was by twenty years. So in a 
                         sense he's the younger man. Anyway, 
                         first one I don't remember so well 
                         but it was about meetin' him in town 
                         somewheres and he give me some money 
                         and I think I lost it. The second 
                         one, it was like we was both back in 
                         older times and I was on horseback 
                         goin' through the mountains of a 
                         night.

               EXT. SNOWY MOUNTAIN PASS - NIGHT

               We cut to night, and snow. It is the image that the movie 
               began with. Continuing in voice over:

                                     VOICE OVER
                         ...goin' through this pass in the 
                         mountains. It was cold and snowin', 
                         hard ridin'. Hard country. He rode 
                         past me and kept on goin'. Never 
                         said nothin' goin' by. He just rode 
                         on past and he had his blanket wrapped 
                         around him and his head down...

               The rider passes as described, horses' hooves drumming and 
               scattering divots of earth and snow.

                                     VOICE OVER
                         ...and when he rode past I seen he 
                         was carryin' fire in a horn the way 
                         people used to do and I could see 
                         the horn from the light inside of 
                         it. About the color of the moon. And 
                         in the dream I knew that he was goin' 
                         on ahead and that he was fixin' to 
                         make a fire somewhere out there in 
                         all that dark and all that cold, and 
                         I knew that whenever I got there he 
                         would be there. Out there up ahead.

               The rider recedes and the image fades, the horn bearing fire 
               going last.

                                         THE END
