The Cell



     FADE IN:

     A SPECK OF DUST

     Grains of sand dance in the wind.  As we glide over a VAST
     DESERT, the speck of dust becomes a HORSE AND RIDER. 
     CATHERINE YOUNG straddles the beautiful black animal, her
     mesmerizing eyes scanning the horizon.  A curious breeze
     blows across her exquisite face and she drinks it in, as if
     the wind itself were telling something to her...

     Catherine sees a FLICKERING LIGHT in the sand.  She pulls the
     reins and the horse stops moments before the dune drops into
     nothingness.  She dismounts, affectionately scratches the
     horse's neck, and follows the LIGHT.  When she looks over her
     shoulder, the Arabian is now a child's WOODEN HOBBY HORSE. 
     Not surprised, Catherine smiles and walks down a dune, sand
     sliding beneath her feet...

     She finds herself in a valley of dead trees whose decayed,
     gnarled limbs appear to form hands.  The light dances across
     her face.  She shades her eyes and pinpoints the source...

     A SMALL MIRROR reflecting rays of bright sun, housed within a
     locket and chain.  It's held by EDWARD, a haunted-looking boy
     of seven with a precocious grin and piercing eyes.  He sits
     on a fallen tree trunk, patiently waiting for her arrival.

                    CATHERINE
          Thanks for the horse.

     He's a shy child, yet comfortable with Catherine.

                    EDWARD
          You liked him?

                    CATHERINE
          He's beautiful...

     Edward smiles, delighted he made her happy.

                    CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          But I thought we were going sailing.

     The boy frowns.

                    CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          You promised.

     A devilish glint in his eye, Edward redirects the mirror. 
     Catherine follows the flicker to a TOY BOAT in the sand.

                    CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          We can't fit into that!

     Edward shines light in her eyes, momentarily blinding her,
     then snaps the locket shut.  When her vision clears,
     Catherine sees a GIANT SHIP perched among the dunes.  A craft
     weighing hundreds of tons just sitting there in the desert.

                    CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          That'll do.

     She walks toward it, but Edward doesn't follow.

                    CATHERINE (CONT'D)
               (coaxing him)
          Come on, Mister E.

     She extends her hand, but he adamantly shakes his head no.

                    CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          What now?

                    EDWARD
               (nods at the ship)
          's broken.

     Undaunted, she... finds herself standing on the DECK.

                    CATHERINE
               (calling to him)
          Who says?

                    EDWARD
          Mocky-Lock.

                    CATHERINE
          Oh no... No you don't.

                    EDWARD
          "Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman.  Mocky-Lock
          wants me where I am."

                    CATHERINE
          I bet we can fix it.

     She opens a rusted iron DOOR.  It makes an HORRIFIC
     SCREECHING SOUND.  Similar to metal-on-metal, but more
     piercing, more pained.  As if made by a living thing.

                    CATHERINE (CONT'D)
               (familiar with the noise, a
               warning to him)
          Ed-ward...

     The boy's FACE CONTORTS, turning into something half-human,
     half-animal.  A monster.  Mocky-Lock.  He SCREECHES, trying
     to frighten Catherine, but she cocks her head...

                    CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          We agreed.  No more Mocky-Lock.

     The creature sticks its tongue out and DIVES.

                    CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          Edward!

     But it's too late!  Edward/Mocky Lock slithers into the sand
     and disappears.  Resigning herself to a failure, she opens
     the palm of her left hand, revealing a SMALL BUMP in the
     flesh between thumb and forefinger.  She presses hard and...

     PICTURE AND SOUND DISTORT AND CHANGE

     INT. LABORATORY - DAY

     We are looking at a large SCREEN showing an electronically
     generated three-dimensional view of a human brain featuring
     color-coded neurological activity.  In a specific section of
     the image, cells flash from yellow to red...

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL HENRY WEST surrounded by computers,
     monitors, electronics, and keyboards.  DR. MIRIAM KENT stands
     before a peculiar diagnostic machine scrutinizing data and
     images.  Both wear garb favored by surgeons or microchip
     assemblers.  The impressive, weird computer system HUMS as it
     shifts programs, the unusual brain image changing colors.  

     THROUGH A LARGE WINDOW, we see into an ADJOINING ROOM within
     which a HUMAN FIGURE hangs suspended in mid-air by a series
     of cables designed to simulate flotation.

     AT THE CONSOLE, Miriam uses a pen to hit specific areas of
     the touch-sensitive screen, changing the complex CHEMICAL
     SYMBOLS displayed there.

     IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, a series of pharmaceuticals are
     injected into an intravenous tube feeding the sleeve/arm of
     the figure.  A featherweight cloth MASK electronically rises,
     revealing the sleeping face of Catherine.

     AT THE CONSOLE, Miriam hits a button and speaks into an
     intercom microphone.

                    MIRIAM
          Sing a song of sixpence...

     IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, there is no reaction from Catherine.

                    MIRIAM (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Sing a song of sixpence...

                    CATHERINE
               (hoarse, groggy)
          A pocketful of rye...

                    MIRIAM (O.S.)
          Four-and-twenty blackbirds.

     Catherine's eyes open.

                    CATHERINE
          Baked in a pie...

     IN THE CONTROL ROOM, Henry hits a switch and Catherine is
     lowered to the pedestal.  Miriam checks Monitors displaying
     Catherine's vital signs and continuing what must be a
     routine, presses numbers on a keypad to open the PRESSURIZED
     AIRTIGHT DOOR separating the two areas.

     IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, lights come on and Miriam eases
     Catherine out of the apparatus.  She checks her pupil
     dilation, pulse, throat, and reflexes.  She pokes and prods
     with a familiarity that would seem rude to an outside
     observer, but is nothing to them.  Getting to her feet, we
     see that Catherine's BODYSUIT is made of an unusual dark
     fabric almost liquid in consistency.

     AT THE CONSOLE, Henry moves to another section and for the
     first time, we see there are two elaborate neural monitors. 
     And the "brain" pictured here is smaller.  Younger...

                    HENRY
          "Mister E." is doing fine.

     REVEAL A SECOND FIGURE suspended from the ceiling in the
     PROCEDURE ROOM.  A SMALL BOY is lowered to the pedestal and
     as Miriam records data, Catherine removes the child's "mask,"
     displaying the haunted face of Edward.  Clearly, the boy is
     in some kind of catatonic state.

                    MIRIAM
          Did we go sailing?

                    CATHERINE
          Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.

                    MIRIAM
          "Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock
          wants me where I am."

                    CATHERINE
          Mocky-Lock is a pain in the ass.

     Henry communicates with them via the intercom.

                    HENRY
          Where did that come from again?

     Catherine looks annoyed - How could he forget?

                    CATHERINE
          A nursery rhyme.

     Catherine detaches the cables and eases Edward's frail body
     into a waiting wheelchair.  Miriam takes a penlight and
     examines the boy's eyes... An emotionless void, oddly
     beautiful.

                    MIRIAM
               (thinking aloud)
          Nursery rhymes, fairy tales, the
          bogeyman... All preparation for the
          horrors of the real world.

     Making certain the child is comfortable, Catherine covers him
     with a blanket, rests a teddy bear on his lap, and pushes him
     into the CONTROL ROOM, accompanied by Miriam.  Henry types in
     a command and moves to join them.

                    HENRY
          Anybody hungry?  I'm hungry...

     A BUZZER sounds and ANOTHER DOOR HISSES OPEN... A constantly
     fretting administrator, BARRY COOPERMAN, is waiting for them
     in the corridor.

                    COOPERMAN
          Edward's parents are here.

     We can see it in Catherine's face - this isn't good news.

     EXT. CAMPBELL CENTER - DAY

     Situated in a corporate/industrial area north of San Diego,
     California, a series of well-secured buildings form a mini
     compound.  A sign near the gate reads CAMPBELL CENTER - A
     DIVISION OF SUNERSET INDUSTRIES.

     INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - EDWARD'S ROOM - DAY

     Although this is a hospital room filled with medical
     equipment, its sterility has been camouflaged with toys,
     posters, photographs, and drawings to make it more "homey." 
     (Some hint at aspects of Edward's fantasy world).  Every
     comfort has been provided and no expense spared.

     Henry, Miriam, and Catherine, now wearing funky/casual
     clothes under a lab coat, stand opposite Cooperman.  Sitting
     on the bed with Edward is ELLA BAINES, an elegantly dressed
     woman in her mid-40's.  There is a soulfulness to her, but
     the husband, LUCIEN BAINES, 60's, possesses the icy demeanor
     of a corporate tycoon.  One might write him off as cold, but
     we sense a genuine love for his wife and child.  Ella smiles
     and caresses Edward's hair.

                    ELLA
          He needs a haircut.

                    CATHERINE
          I'll tell the nurse.
               (sensing something in Edward)
          God, he loves when you visit.

                    ELLA
          My husband wonders if that's true.
               (delivering bad news)
          He wants to place Edward in a hospital.

     Seeing an unfunded future, Henry's ready to disassociate
     himself from Miriam and Catherine...

                    HENRY
          There are other applications for the
          scanner, Mr. Baines...

                    LUCIEN
          I realize that, Henry...
               (to Miriam)
          And I know your work, Dr. Kent, is
          invaluable to this company...

                    CATHERINE
          You don't know about me, though, do you?

                    LUCIEN
          Catherine, we've waited eighteen months
          for signs of progress...

                    CATHERINE
          There's been progress.

                    LUCIEN
          Yes, but there is no proof the procedure
          works.  All I have is a belief that your
          interaction with my son is not a
          hallucination.

     Catherine is hurt and vulnerable due to exhaustion and the
     intensity of her experience with Edward, but feels she must
     defend herself.

                    CATHERINE
               (to Cooperman, Miriam, Henry)
          You picked me, remember?  And I took the
          job.  Gladly.  This is the next wave and
          I want to be part of it...

                    COOPERMAN
          No one is doubting your ability.

                    CATHERINE
          Then what is it?

     Introspective and solemn-eyed, Lucien takes a moment, then:

                    LUCIEN
          I've invested millions of dollars in
          this study... And I've convinced others
          to do the same.  I suppose I should feel
          responsible to them, but I don't.  I
          could care less if they see a profit. 
          I'm responsible to my boy, that's all
          that matters.
               (looks her in the eye)
          You tell me... Am I doing the right
          thing?

     OFF CATHERINE'S FACE...

     INT. WHITE ROOM - DAY

     At first, we're not sure where we are or what's happening. 
     It's too bright, the space confining.  As our eyes adjust, we
     seem to be in a bathroom or shower stall.  We HEAR a WOMAN
     CRYING and the camera finds ANNE VICKSEY.  Dark circles
     beneath eyes red and puffy from crying.  Hair wet and ratted. 
     Sweater and pants damp and stained.  Barefoot, she shivers
     from cold and fear...

     PULL BACK to show more of her surroundings.  The white-tiled
     10' x 8' room features a SHOWER HEAD, TOILET, and a push
     button SPIGOT for drinking water.  Two walls are SOLID, the
     other two MIRRORED, the glass covered by thick clear plastic.

     The floor is littered with empty food wrappers - candy bars,
     juice boxes.  In the center of the floor is a DRAIN and above
     her, on the ceiling, a FLUORESCENT LAMP, also encased in
     clear plastic.

     There is no door.

     A mechanism CLICKS. Then a RUMBLING... Anne seems to know
     what's coming.  She presses against the wall, removes her
     arms from the sleeves of the sweater, hunches down, and
     raises the garment over her head, forming a tent.

     WATER ERUPTS from the shower head.  There is no steam, so
     this water must be cold.  Shaking, Anne whispers a count to
     herself - "One-one thousand, two-one thousand, three..." and
     so on.  The spray hits everything in the room - mirror,
     toilet, floor - and a food wrapper drifts toward the drain.

                    ANNE
          Thirty.

     She peeks up from the tent, but the water has not stopped,
     and that isn't what she expected.  We hear a soft SUCKING
     NOISE and a CLICK.  The wrapper rises on a puddle of water. 
     Anne POUNDS her fist on the wall.

                    ANNE (CONT'D)
               (angry, scared)
          THIRTY!

     A puddle forms around her feet and she realizes the drain has
     somehow been sealed shut.  Her panic intensifies as we hear
     another CLICK and the water pressure increases.

     INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY - DAY

     In the darkened procedure room, Miriam finds Catherine
     standing between the two suspension devices, alone.

                    MIRIAM
          You okay?

     Catherine turns, nods, and tries to smile.  Has she been
     crying?  Miriam steps further into the room.

                    CATHERINE
          He hates me.

                    MIRIAM
          Lucien Baines?

     Catherine nods.

                    MIRIAM (CONT'D)
          I wouldn't say "hates."  Dislikes,
          distrusts, maybe.

     Catherine laughs.  Exactly what Miriam wanted.

                    MIRIAM (CONT'D)
          She adores you.

                    CATHERINE
          She thinks I can bring Edward back.

                    MIRIAM
          Someday you can.  We all believe that...

     Catherine halfheartedly nods, but her mind is elsewhere,
     focused on the two apparatuses.

                    CATHERINE
          I want to try it.  Please.

     Miriam knows what this is about.

                    MIRIAM
          We've been over this a dozen times.  No.

                    CATHERINE
          Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What
          harm could it do?

                    MIRIAM
          I don't want to find out.

     Ever the doctor, Miriam finds herself surreptitiously
     examining Catherine's eyes, flesh tone, a slight trembling in
     her fingertips.

                    CATHERINE
          Why is it taking so long for us to reach
          him?  Because we've been reactive,
          that's why.  And we need to be active.

     Miriam reaches for Catherine's wrist and takes her pulse.

                    CATHERINE (CONT'D)
               (annoyed)
          Miriam...

                    MIRIAM
          Shush.

     As Miriam examines her, Catherine continues:

                    CATHERINE
          He creates the obstacles, he decides
          which games to play.

                    MIRIAM
          I've heard this argument before.  It's
          not happening.

                    CATHERINE
               (frustrated)
          It could take years for me to get past
          the barriers he's created.

                    MIRIAM
          If we reverse the feed and bring Edward
          into your mind, it could be devastating
          for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly
          existing in a whole other world.

                    CATHERINE
          I do it all the time!

                    MIRIAM
          Yes, but, you're a willing participant. 
          Picture Edward in a strange place, lost,
          frightened...

                    CATHERINE
          I'd be there for him.

                    MIRIAM
          And he might blame you for terrifying
          him.  That one moment could erase all
          you've accomplished.  And if that
          happened, the trust he has in you is
          gone.

                    CATHERINE
               (defeated)
          Okay, okay...

     Miriam takes a penlight and examines Catherine's eyes.

                    MIRIAM
          Besides, I don't know what it might do
          to you.  You're already exhausted.
               (concerned)
          Have you been sleeping?

     Catherine nods.

                    MIRIAM (CONT'D)
          I can prescribe something...

     Catherine shakes her head no.  Miriam shuts off the penlight
     and looks at Catherine with professional and personal
     concern.

                    MIRIAM (CONT'D)
          You're sure?  Any more nightmares?

                    CATHERINE
               (defensively)
          No.

                    MIRIAM
          Good.  We need you healthy and relaxed. 
          You're going to eat well, meditate,
          exercise, and watch mindless television.

                    CATHERINE
          Yes mother.

                    MIRIAM
          I don't want you up all night reading
          Edward's case file of the nine millionth
          time.  Balance, dear girl, is the key. 
          Leave the work here.

     She taps Catherine's head.

                    MIRIAM (CONT'D)
          Don't bring it home in this.

                    CATHERINE
          Okay.

     Miriam gathers her belongings.

                    MIRIAM
          Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese
          place he's wild about.  Want to come?

                    CATHERINE
               (declining)
          I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I
          want to get to bed early.

                    MIRIAM
          That's my girl.

     Miriam exits, but Catherine remains, still curious what could
     happen if things were reversed.

     INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - HALLWAY - DAY

     The corridors are dark and most everyone has gone home.  At
     the NURSES STATION, a staff member observes the child on a
     closed-circuit monitor.  Further down the hall, Miriam and
     Henry exit.  Wearing a (chic) thrift store coat and lugging a
     worn book bag, Catherine stands outside Edward's room,
     watching him sleep.

                    CATHERINE
          Pleasant dreams, Mister E.

     EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - DAY

     A GREEN FORD PICK-UP TRUCK cruises down this deserted stretch
     of two-lane blacktop, the driver carefully maintaining the
     speed limit.  He signals and exits...

     EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

     The truck rumbles along a stretch of bumpy, unpaved road. 
     The area is desolate, depressing, and deserted.  It feels
     like no one's been anywhere near here for years.  The pick-up
     stops at a RUSTED GATE and the DRIVER, a tall, lean, sinewy
     fellow undoes a combination lock-and-chain.  We do not yet
     see his face.

     EXT. ABANDONED FARM HOUSE - DAY

     The truck parks inside a charred barn, now hidden from view,
     and the driver steps out, followed by his DOG.

     A magnificent WHITE GERMAN SHEPHERD.  We notice a GLINT in
     its BLUE EYES - the animal's an albino.  The driver points
     and whistles.  Well-trained, the Shepard sprints to the gate
     and waits, keeping a watchful eye on the road.

     INT. THE CELL - OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

     From the outside, a passerby would never know this sanctuary
     existed.  Within the foundation of a farm building never
     completed, we find a small room in the center of a much
     larger space.  The cell.  We hear the WHIR of ELECTRONIC
     EQUIPMENT and notice VIDEO CAMERAS mounted on tripods pointed
     at the two-way glass.  We follow CABLES to a massive VIDEO
     RECORDER - the type used in surveillance, able to record for
     days without maintenance, and an elaborate TIMING DEVICE
     connected to a series of VALVES and SWITCHES.

     As if in a beatific trance, the driver moves to the window
     and gently rests his palm on the glass.  ANNE MOVES!  Arms
     flailing, mouth gasping, eyes filled with dread.  The last
     spark of life... The driver JUMPS, startled and frightened.

     Almost shamefully, he turns and hides, unable to look at her. 
     Suddenly, his body tenses and writhes, as if seized by
     torturous pain.  He opens his mouth in a silent scream.

     And then, quickly as it came, the pain subsides.  Hidden in
     shadow, he breathes deeply, regaining self-control.  He
     waits, then moves back to the glass.  Anne's dead face floats
     past him.  Almost angelic.  He watches her and leans his head
     against the window, closer.  And the driver catches his own
     reflection in the mirror.

     Meet CARL STARGHER.

     EXT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Small and isolated, the nearest neighbor a block away.

     INT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     The place is a mess.  Computer print-outs, dirty dishes,
     unopened mail, videotapes, and notepads cover tables, chairs
     and floor.  On the crammed bookshelves, psychology texts sit
     next to volumes on mythology, religion, and the occult. 
     Totems, figurines and artifacts (Central and South American
     in origin) adorn the walls and tables.

     As Portishead plays on the stereo, we find Catherine
     suffering from insomnia, wearing goofy-yet-hip eyeglasses,
     sweatpants and a UCSD T-shirt, sharing a late-night snack
     with her pet CAT.  She shuts the refrigerator door and we
     linger on an odd POSTCARD taped to the surface.  A kitschy
     postcard of a warrior/goddess.

     INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

     We MOVE out of shadow, toward a bright focused light,
     following the albino German Shepherd - VALENTINE - as it
     enters a VAST SUBTERRANEAN ROOM.  Most of the walls have been
     knocked down, leaving only thick support posts.  Valentine
     finds Stargher in a DUGOUT PIT - about five feet deeper than
     the rest of the room - polishing a stainless steel table.  A
     bright tungsten work light hangs above, and near it is the
     chain, cables and hooks of a customized MECHANICAL HOIST.

     The dog picks up an unpleasant scent and follows it to a far
     corner where there are empty jugs of BLEACH sitting next to a
     long, deep cast iron TUB.  Stargher WHISTLES and Valentine
     obediently retreats to a KENNEL CAGE.  Stargher gives him a
     chew toy and locks the dog inside before moving to the tub.

     Soaking in the bleach is the nude corpse of Anne Vicksey. 
     The interior of the tub is glazed with gleaming porcelain and
     the whiteness of her flesh makes it appear as though she is
     floating in nothingness, but what hypnotizes and appalls are
     her eyes.  Wide open, transformed by the chlorine into
     something ghostly, they are unforgettable.

     As the bleach gurgles down the drain, Stargher lifts Anne
     from the tub and carries her to the table.  He places her
     face up and dries her with a clean white towel.  He moves her
     limbs, lips, hips, and hands into desired positions then
     retreats into shadow.  In the harsh light, against the shiny
     table, the bleached body has the quality of an apparition and
     we almost expect her to move...

     We HEAR Stargher remove his clothes and he steps into the
     pool of light.  Nude, we see that his lean, muscular frame is
     laced with some rough tatoos.  When he turns his back to us,
     we find EIGHT METAL RINGS, thick and strong, PIERCED through
     his flesh.  Two columns of four on either side of the spine,
     running from shoulder blade to just below the waist.  What in
     God's name are they for?

     Stargher shuts off the work light and moves to an area where
     he keeps TELEVISION MONITORS and VCRs.  He inserts a
     videocassette taken from the surveillance deck and watches
     the screen.

     In BLACK AND WHITE, we see Anne awaken in the cell.  Her
     first moments inside.  Disoriented, terrified, trapped, she
     examines her surroundings.

     Stargher is mesmerized by her fear.  Fast-forwarding to her
     death, he presses a remote and we get SOUND.  Anne screaming,
     begging for her life.  Aroused, stimulated, Stargher drinks
     it in like a symphony.  Valentine cowers in the back of his
     cage, hating this.

     INT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Lying on her bed (a waterbed), Catherine sleepily stares at
     the ceiling, rolls onto her side, and feels herself drawn
     into the comforter.  The folds of the fabric become ripples. 
     Ripples become dunes.

     EXT. EDWARD'S WORLD - DAY

     And we find ourselves in the DESERT of EDWARD'S WORLD.

     We fly over dunes and come up behind Catherine as she
     struggles through waves of sand.  The tree trunk is up ahead
     and we glimpse someone hiding inside.

     Catherine reaches.  MOCKEY-LOCK ERUPTS FROM WITHIN THE TREE
     TRUNK!  SNARLING!  Catherine retreats, silently screaming.

     INT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAWN

     IN HER OWN BED, Catherine's eyes are open.  In sharp contrast
     to a typical reaction to a nightmare, she remains calm.  No
     sweaty face, no gasp, no reaction at all, really.  She might
     as well have been dreaming of puppy dogs.  Wide awake, her
     eyes return their gaze to the ceiling.

                    CATHERINE
          Go.  To.  Sleep.

     INT. STARGHER HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

     CHAINS attached to bizarre HOOKS dangle from the ceiling. 
     Admiring Anne's body, Stargher links the hooks to the rings
     in his back.  He presses a remote unit and up in the rafters,
     a series of GEARS click into motion.  The sound is torturous
     as the mechanical hoist LIFTS Stargher off the ground,
     pulling at the rings, strips of flesh rising.  Stargher
     grimaces, but clearly he wants the pain, needs it.  As the
     hoist clicks into another gear, it carries Stargher over the
     table until his body is perfectly positioned above Anne's.

     In the flickering weird light of the television screen,
     Stargher resembles something from the twisted imagination of
     William Blake - a levitating demon ready to debauch an
     innocent angel.  With his free hand, he touches himself,
     chains clinking and swaying.

     EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY

     A railroad bridge and highway span an almost-bone-dry creek
     bed.  Gathered beneath the overpass are the POLICE, CORONER,
     CRIMINIALISTS, AND A LOCAL FBI.  A SEDAN travels down a
     service road and stops nearby.  TWO MEN exit, identify
     themselves as FBI and move to the crime scene.

     Special Agent GORDON RAMSEY is well-groomed, prides himself
     on professionalism, and follows the Bureau party line. 
     Special Agent PETER NOVAK is rough around the edges,
     introspective, and intense.  A loner who marches to the tune
     of a peculiar drummer, he's unconventionally handsome with
     probing eyes.  He moves slowly, observing the scene - the
     world, for that matter - from a unique perspective.

     As Ramsey finds the FBI's local liaison - AGENT COLE - Novak
     oblivious to the people around him, touches dirt, smells the
     air, and examines road, river, bridge and sky.

                    RAMSEY
          Who found her?

     Cole nods at a visibly shaken WORKMAN seated in a patrol car.

                    COLE
          Surveyor for the railroad... 'Bout six
          this morning.

     Novak sees a FEMALE BODY wrapped in plastic and bound by
     wire.  Supervising the examination of the woman is FBI
     PATHOLOGIST DR. THEODORE "TEDDY" LEE, a polite, dapper
     southern gentleman.

                    NOVAK
          Thanks for waiting, Teddy.

     Teddy gives Novak a friendly, respectful salute - "My
     pleasure."  Novak dons gloves, nods to an FBI PHOTOGRAPHER
     and assists Teddy Lee in snipping wire and peeling back thick
     clear plastic.  As the photographer reacts to a strong smell,
     Teddy comments.

                    TEDDY LEE
          Bleach.

     As the man snaps pictures, Ramsey and Cole join them.  Sadly,
     Novak recognizes the face.

                    NOVAK
          Anne Marie Vicksey.

     We recognize her, too.

                    COLE
          She the one from Santa Cruz?

                    NOVAK
          Just graduated law school.  Single mom. 
          Had a two-year-old daughter.

     He and Teddy expose the bleached flesh of her torso, neither
     man surprised.  Coldly thorough, Novak finds another of the
     killer's tell-tale signs.

                    NOVAK (CONT'D)
               (instructing the photographer)
          The semen on her legs and abdomen.

     FLASH! Photos are taken.

                    TEDDY LEE
          Someone looking after her little girl?

                    NOVAK
          Grandparents.  Live over in Davis.

     Novak looks into the dead white eyes of Anne Vicksey, trying
     to imagine the horrors she beheld.  He moves to the creek and
     sees only a few inches of water.  His eyes move from the drop
     site to the highway above.

                    TEDDY LEE
          The poor thing.

     FLASH!  We're up there now, ON THE OVERPASS, with the
     photographer and Novak, examining TIRE TRACKS in the soft
     shoulder.  Novak peers over the edge at the crime scene,
     steps back, and focuses on the highway - imagining the
     killer's truck as it disappeared into the night.
     
     
     
     EXT. OFFICE PLAZA - DAY

      A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN, JULIA HICKSON, shares lunch with her
     fiancee, JOHN TRACY.  They talk, laugh and kiss, not a care
     in the world.

     INT. PICK-UP TRUCK - ACROSS THE STREET - DAY

     As TALK RADIO plays, Carl Stargher watches them, specifically
     Julia, his eyes never off her for too long as his hands work
     on something banal but unseen.

                    TALK RADIO HOST
          ...complaining about government
          subsidies for farmers...

     The voice on the radio becomes DISTORTED as we hear it
     through Stargher's ears...

                    TALK RADIO HOST (CONT'D)
          ...but without subsidies, families will
          starve, and I'm nodd
          exagggeerrrrr....ayding.  Iff id werrrr
          up tooooo meeeee.....

     The host's voice fades into a guttural, monstrous groan.

                    TALK RADIO HOST (CONT'D)
          Meeeee gawwwwwdd Caaaarrrrlll.  Mee god
          cum...
               (returning to normal)
          Meeeee....wwuuuuuddunnnnttttt... be
          spending billions on other countries
          when we've got problems right here.

     He opens his eyes and watches John kiss Julia goodbye as she
     returns to work.  Stargher looks down and we see what he's
     been working on - A TOY DOLL.  Female.  Stripped of its
     clothes, a single metal ring stuck through its plastic neck.

     INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

     His lunch finished, Ramsey is on a cell-phone talking to his
     wife.  Chain-drinking coffee, Novak scrutinizes photos of the
     tire tracks.

                    RAMSEY
          Well, honey, what's worse?  Doing it
          yourself or asking your mother for help?
               (gets his answer)
          Can it wait 'til I get back/
               (listens, answers)
          I have no idea, Jeannie.

     Novak checks his watch and the street.  Clearly waiting for
     someone or something.

                    RAMSEY (CONT'D)
          Well all right.  Good luck with the
          Monster.  I love you too.  Bye-bye.

     Ramsey snaps shut the cell-phone.

                    RAMSEY (CONT'D)
          We call Jeannie's mother "The Monster"
          because, well... she just is.

     Novak is oblivious, pouring over tire-related info.

                    RAMSEY (CONT'D)
          I know you could care less about my
          personal life, Peter, but I do
          appreciate the occasional, "How's your
          wife, Gordon?"

     He waits.  Novak obliges:

                    NOVAK
          How is she?

                    RAMSEY
          Pregnant.  Thanks for asking.

     Novak is distracted by Teddy Lee entering the diner.

                    NOVAK
          Here he is.

                    RAMSEY
          Damn, man, I give up.  Your partner
          tells you his wife's gonna have a baby,
          and all you care about is a coroner's
          report!

     Ramsey assesses the exhausted, lonely, intense man sitting
     across from him.

                    RAMSEY (CONT'D)
          I feel for those girls too, Pete.  And
          their families.  But it's just a job. 
          Someday it'll be over.  And then what'll
          you have?

     Much to Novak's appreciation, Teddy Lee's arrival provides an
     escape from answering the question.

                    TEDDY LEE
          Hot off the presses.

     He gives them copies of the AUTOPSY REPORT and FORENSIC
     ANALYSIS of Anne Marie Vicksey.  The WAITRESS sees Teddy,
     approaches, and offers a menu.

                    TEDDY LEE (CONT'D)
               (doesn't need it)
          Chicken fried steak, mashed potatoes,
          garden salad with Thousand Island
          dressing and an iced-tea.  Thank you
          darlin'.

     She nods and moves to the kitchen.  Novak and Ramsey flip
     through the documents.

                    TEDDY LEE (CONT'D)
          Water in her lungs.  Same brand of
          bleach.  Match on the semen.  Lots of
          hair.

                    RAMSEY
               (unenthused)
          More hair.  I could knit this guy a
          toupee.

     Novak finds something in the report that catches him by
     surprise.  He double-checks and shows the item to Teddy.

                    TEDDY LEE
               (reading)
          So?

                    NOVAK
          Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.

     Ramsey checks his copy.

                    NOVAK (CONT'D)
          I need it.

                    TEDDY LEE
          Now?

                    NOVAK
          Now.

     INT. FORENSIC LABORATORY - DAY

     A MONITOR shows a SINGLE HAIR under a video microscope. 
     Teddy Lee plays with the dials and gets a spectral view.

                    TEDDY LEE
          Complete absence of melanin.

     Novak and Ramsey stand over his shoulder.

                    RAMSEY
          And that means?

     Teddy moves aside and takes another bite of his lunch
     (chicken fried steak now carry-out).

                    NOVAK
          The dog's an albino.
               (pictures it)
          He'd love an animal like that.

                    TEDDY LEE
          Gentlemen, I believe an albino dog is
          rare indeed.

     INT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

     Exiting an elevator, Julia heads for her little Toyota. 
     Smart girl that she is, her eyes scan the area and her
     fingers hold a can of mace.

     INT. TOYOTA - NIGHT

     Julia climbs in, checks her mirror and backs up.  WHAM!  Did
     she hit something??  She brakes, puts the car in park, and
     checks her sideview mirror.

     Reflected there is a WOUNDED DOG.  A white German Shepherd. 
     She rolls down her window and can hear the poor thing
     whimpering.

                    JULIA
          Oh no...

     INT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

     Julia exits her car and kneels next to Valentine, who appears
     to be in terrible pain.

                    JULIA
          God... I didn't see you.

     STARGHER'S HANDS COME AT HER FROM BEHIND!  One grabs her hair
     and the other covers her face with a chloroform-soaked towel. 
     He presses so hard, she cannot scream, cannot move.  After a
     brief struggle, he SHOVES her into her car and holds her
     until she passes out.  Stargher pushes Julia into the
     passenger seat and starts the car.  Pulls a dog treat from
     his pocket and WHISTLES.  The Shepherd instantly perks up. 
     Perfectly healthy.  And jumps into the car.

                    STARGHER
               (feeds him a treat)
          Good boy.

     INT. RIVERSIDE COUNTY SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY

     In a BRIEFING ROOM we find Teddy Lee, Ramsey, Cole and local
     cops.  All in need of caffeine.  They complain, gossip, and
     shoot the shit.  Resembling a demanding professor, Novak
     enters and through presence alone, lacking any self
     consciousness about his dishevelled appearance, takes control
     of the room by holding up a PHOTOGRAPH of a young woman.

                    NOVAK
          Donna Krozin.
               (a new picture every time)
          Helen Francis, Teresa Manicki...

     The chatter dies.

                    NOVAK (CONT'D)
          Antoinette Simms, Natalie Pagels, Grace
          Cassatt... Anne Vicksey.

     Every person is solemn and focused.

                    NOVAK (CONT'D)
          Smart, gentle, attractive young women. 
          Just starting out in life. 
          Embarking on careers, going to school,
          getting married...

     He's hooked them.  The victims, these women, now mean
     something to them.  With great effect, he holds up grisly
     post-mortem photos.

                    NOVAK (CONT'D)
          They were killed.  Kidnapped, tortured,
          and murdered.  By a white male.  About
          30-years old.
               (significantly)
          Who owns an albino dog./

     Everyone knows this is a real clue and awareness is
     heightened.  Ramsey chimes in.

                    RAMSEY
          A purebred German Shepherd.

     Novak shows them a picture of a WHITE GERMAN SHEPHERD taken
     from a resource on the Internet.

                    RAMSEY (CONT'D)
          Breeders typically destroy albino pups,
          so this animal is truly unique.

                    NOVAK
          Nicole Labetzki.  Victim seven. 
          Forensics found dog hair in her car, but
          they had a K-9 unit at the scene and
          never had it checked.

                    TEDDY LEE
          The Phoenix office tested that hair
          thirty minutes ago.  And we got the
          match.

                    NOVAK
          It's his dog.

     Ramsey holds up a thick list.

                    RAMSEY
          Registered breeders of German Shepherds.

     The list is long and a few of the cops GROAN.  Novak silences
     them with a fierce look that says, "I will not rest until
     this man is found and neither should you."

                    NOVAK
          Be thorough, but be fast.  This guy's
          accelerating. 
          He only waited six days this last time. 
          When he started, two months could pass.

     A DESK SEARGENT enters the room and hands a FAX to Ramsey. 
     Novak is curious about it, but continues.

                    NOVAK (CONT'D)
          This can mean different things.  He
          thinks we're stupid and can't catch him. 
          He's having fun and needs more.  Or...
               (thinking it through)
          This dog hair thing is sloppy.  The body
          this morning was found in less than
          three inches of water.  He knew we'd
          find her.  He wants to be caught.  But
          if we can't stop him...

     Gravely concerned, Ramsey moves across the room.

                    NOVAK (CONT'D)
               (dreading what's on that fax)
          ...he can't stop himself.

     INT. STARGHER HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

     Stargher, the awful PAIN eating away at his skull.  He
     searches the medicine chest.

                    DISTORTED VOICE
          Me god feed on pain.

     The VOICE echoing inside his skull.

                    DISTORTED VOICE (CONT'D)
          Pain good.  Cumm home to meee...

     INT. STARGHER HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

     Struggling to stay on his feet, he moves to the KITCHEN. 
     Valentine paces nervously, whimpering concern.  Stargher
     reaches for a bottle of vodka but falls to the floor. 
     Valentine BARKS, but gets no reaction from master.  We MOVE
     IN on Stargher's unblinking eyes.

                    DISTORTED VOICE
          Go sleep Carl.  Me god wake up now.

     INT. THE CELL - DAY

     Julia Hickson finds the snack foods, drinking spigot, toilet,
     shower, and drain.  Her bare feet try to adjust to the tile
     floor, but it's fucking cold.  She glimpses herself in the
     mirror and is startled by what she sees - a terrified girl.

     INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY

     A TAN SEDAN sits in the driveway of this modest middle-class
     home.  A VENTURA COUNTY SHERIFF'S CAR sits nearby, a deputy
     keeping watch.

     INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY

     A distraught middle-aged couple, MR. AND MRS. HICKSON, sit on
     the couch of their living room.  FAMILY PHOTOS show them with
     Julia, whose fiancee, John, does his best to comfort the
     mother.  Novak and Ramsey have the unfortunate task of
     interviewing them about their daughter's disappearance.

                    RAMSEY
          She was still living at home?

                    MR. HICKSON
          Yes, sir.

                    JOHN
          We were looking at apartments.

                    MR. HICKSON
               (important they know)
          But nobody was moving in together 'til
          after the wedding.

     Novak hasn't said much.  Instead, he looks at something in
     his hands - a plastic evidence bag containing the TOY DOLL.

                    RAMSEY
          John, you came to pick her up when?

                    JOHN
          Eight o'clock.  We were going out for my
          birthday.

                    MR. HICKSON
          Maybe you made a mistake.  Maybe she...
          she...

     Novak hides the doll.

                    RAMSEY
          No sir.  I'm sorry.

     Ramsey's cell-phone rings and he excuses himself to a corner
     of the room, leaving Novak alone to deal with this
     uncomfortable, sad situation, no one saying a word until an
     emotionally shattered Mrs. Hickson, fingering a rosary, feels
     compelled to tell him.

                    NOVAK
          After three years she remembers what the
          guy drove?

                    RAMSEY
          She remembers because it was her "dream
          truck."  Wanted one just like it.

     EXT. SMALL AIRPORT - DAY

     Ramsey and Novak exit a small jet and are met by FBI Agent
     STOCKWELL.

                    STOCKWELL
          Ramsey, Novak?

     They nod and he directs them to a waiting GMC SUBURBAN.

                    STOCKWELL (CONT'D)
          Agent Stockwell.

                    NOVAK
          Where is he?

                    STOCKWELL
          Edison.  Just east of Loma Park.  SWAT's
          had the house under surveillance for
          about twenty minutes.
               (info memorized)
          Suspect is Carl Rudolph Stargher.  No
          registered weapons, no priors.  Got a
          license for his dog, though.  Named him
          Valentine...

     INT. GMC SUBURBAN - DAY

     Stockwell is behind the wheel, racing down the highway. 
     Ramsey's in the passenger seat, Novak in back.  Shotguns and
     body armor line the cargo area.  Novak's eyes target the FAX,
     a copy of Stargher's license and registration, and the grainy
     dot-matrix image of the suspect's face.  And Novak knows he's
     found him.

                    NOVAK
          You're the bad man, aren't you, Carl?

     EXT. STARGHER HOUSE/NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

     A sparsely populated lower-middle class neighborhood.  A half
     dozen plain houses at the end of a cul-de-sac.  Bare trees. 
     Brown lawns.  Crows in the air.

     The house furthest from the main road has a white Ford F250
     pick-up in the driveway.  Green trim.

     THE SUBURBAN, hidden from Stargher's house, four-wheels it
     through a prairie and stops outside the backyard of a
     PRESCHOOL, where two more Suburbans and a van already wait.

     INT. PRESCHOOL - DAY

     Stockwell introduces Ramsey and Novak to BROCK, leader of the
     FBI Tactical Unit, a calm, confident ex-Marine wearing a
     black uniform and body armor.

                    BROCK
          Glad you could make it.  We lose the sun
          in half an hour.

     Novak and Ramsey join him at the shaded window to observe
     Stargher's house.  Children's drawings fill the wall.  As
     Brock explains, Novak checks with binoculars.

                    BROCK (CONT'D)
          Perimeter's two-hundred yards around the
          house.  Three men at the rear, two on
          each side, four up front.  I've got two
          marksmen on the roof.

                    NOVAK
          Have they seen him?

                    BROCK
          No.  There's been movement in the
          kitchen.  But it could be the dog.
               (important)
          You think she's in there?

     Novak is careful with his answer.

                    NOVAK
          We proceed assuming she is.

                    RAMSEY
          Let's give old Carl a call.  Tell him
          he's got company.

                    NOVAK
          No.
               (to Brock)
          Can you get a man close?

     EXT. STARGHER HOUSE - DAY

     Quiet.  Calm.  And then we catch a glimpse of a FIGURE
     advancing, using any cover he can, until he is right outside
     the house.  The sneaky SWAT team member, ERICSON, whispers
     into his throat mic.

                    ERICSON
          I'm at the back door.

                    BROCK (V.O.)
               (in Ericson's earpiece)
          Check the kitchen.

     Ericson maneuvers his way to the kitchen window and uses a
     MIRROR to sneak a peek.  In the REFLECTION we see a
     motionless man lying on the floor.

                    ERICSON
          I have a man down.  Repeat, man down.

                    BROCK (V.O.)
          Stargher?

     Ericson chances a quick visual check and pops his head up
     before reporting.

                    ERICSON
          Can't see his face.

     INT. PRESCHOOL - DAY

     Brock looks to Novak, urgency and tension mounting.  Novak
     knows how much is riding on this specific moment.  All the
     various outcomes.  And decides.

                    NOVAK
          Go.

     EXT. STARGHER HOUSE - DAY

     The SWAT TEAM SWARMS towards the house.

     INT. STARGHER HOUSE - DAY

     ERICSON KICKS IN THE BACK DOOR.  GUN READY!

                    ERICSON
          FBI!

     He and THREE OTHERS rush inside!

     BAM!  FOUR MEN KICK in and proceed through the FRONT DOOR!

                    SWAT TEAM MEMBER
          FBI!

     An odd quiet is all they encounter.  IN THE BACK, Ericson
     moves through a LAUNDRY ROOM and finds VALENTINE hiding
     behind a pile of dirty clothes, frightened by these masked
     figures in black.

                    ERICSON
               (into throat mic)
          I've got the dog!

     He points for someone to secure the animal and MOVES into the
     KITCHEN, aiming his gun at the man on the floor, finally
     getting a look at his face.

                    ERICSON (CONT'D)
               (recognizing him)
          Carl Stargher!  Do not move!

     No problem there.  Stargher appears lifeless.  As various
     SWAT team members secure the house, Ericson removes his mask
     and CUFFS Stargher, startled at the sight of the horrible
     RINGS piercing his back.

                    ERICSON (CONT'D)
          Jesus Christ...

     EXT. PRESCHOOL/STARGHER'S HOUSE - DAY

     As an AMBULANCE emerges from a hiding place behind another
     garage, we FOLLOW NOVAK and RAMSEY as they run from the
     preschool into the house.

     INT. STARGHER HOUSE

     As a K-9 UNIT secures Valentine, Novak storms into the
     kitchen, checks Stargher for a pulse and barks at SWAT>

                    NOVAK
          Paramedics.  NOW.

     Ramsey pushes through and Novak informs him.

                    NOVAK (CONT'D)
          He's alive.

     EXT. STARGHER HOUSE - DAY

     FBI AGENTS and local police cordon off the area.

     INT. STARGHER HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

     Valentine is muzzled and led away as the PARAMEDICS load
     Stargher onto a stretcher.  Agent Stockwell turns to a
     worried Novak.

                    STOCKWELL
          They'll take him to County General. 
          Reid's already there.

                    NOVAK
          Make sure he stays cuffed.  Two men on
          him at all times.  I don't want anyone
          treating him but Reid.  Not so much as a
          thermometer up his ass.  Understand?

     Stockwell nods and follows the stretcher outside.  A stoic
     Ramsey enters from the living room and Novak can see the
     disappointment in his eyes.

                    RAMSEY
          She's not here.

     Novak would give anything for that not to be true.

                    RAMSEY (CONT'D)
               (it gets worse)
          You should come downstairs.

     INT. STARGHER HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY

     Ramsey leads Novak into Stargher's "workroom."  It's all
     here, the table, the piercing supplies, the bleach.  An odd,
     grisly collection of DOLLS fills cubby holes in a wooden
     storage/shelf unit.  Novak's eyes are like a camera,
     documenting and storing as much information as possible, but
     it's overwhelming.

     He moves through the basement.  Careful not to touch
     anything.  He stops and focuses on the hoist and eight hooks
     situated over the stainless steel table.  (NOTE: ON THE
     WINCH'S MOTOR IS A WORN PLAQUE READING "CARVER INDUSTRIAL
     EQUIPMENT" with a logo).

     Ramsey switches on the video monitor and the screen fills
     with images of Anne dying in the cell.

     Novak is painfully, tragically drawn to this.  Although he's
     seen his share of horrific things, Novak is truly disturbed
     by the sight of Anne, desperate to escape, drowning, slowly
     dying, and he knows: This is what will happen to Julia
     Hickson unless he finds her.

     INT. THE CELL - NIGHT

     CLICK.  WATER SPRAYS FROM THE SHOWER.  Caught by surprise,
     Julia blocks the spray with her hands and searches for a shut
     off valve.  Of course, there is none.  Thirty seconds later,
     the water stops.  Like an animal caught in a trap, Julia's
     eyes dart around her "cage."  What kind of hell is this? 
     Shivering, she catches herself in the mirror and looks deeply
     into it.  Something's odd about the glass.  Is someone
     watching her?  She bangs on it with her fist.

                    JULIA
          Hey!

     POUND, POUND, POUND!

                    JULIA (CONT'D)
          LET ME OUT!!!

     But there's no response.  Only her reflection.

     INT. KERN COUNTY HOSPITAL - EXAMINATION ROOM - NIGHT

     A HUMAN EYE.  No movement, no deviation of the iris.  A fixed
     stare.  The catatonic Stargher lies in a hospital bed, wrists
     cuffed to the frame.  An IV feeds him fluids and monitors
     report his vital signs.  As a nervous NURSE exits, we see TWO
     POLICEMEN standing guard in the outer hallway.  Novak, Ramsey
     and Teddy Lee stand by as the killer is examined by DR.
     MILTON REID, a brilliant forensic M.D. currently shining an
     opthalmoscope into Stargher's eyes.  He pulls away and checks
     the ELECTROENCENPHELOGRAM already on a lightbox.

                    REID
          Minimal activity in the dorsolateral
          prefrontal cortex.  And here, the
          anterior cingulate cortex.
               (to Novak and Ramsey)
          It's what helps distinguish between
          external and internal stimuli.

                    RAMSEY
          What the hell does that mean?

                    TEDDY LEE
               (answering for Reid)
          He's schizophrenic.

     Novak doesn't like this.  Not one bit.

                    RAMSEY
          What're you doing here, Reid?  Paving
          the way for his insanity defense?

                    REID
          No need.  There won't be a trial.  This
          is no act.  The coma is real.

                    RAMSEY
          Whoa.  Wait a minute.

                    REID
          You ever hear of Whalen's Infraction?

     Clearly not.

                    REID (CONT'D)
               (re: the EEG)
          In any schizophrenic, these areas would
          be affected.  But in someone with
          Whalen's, they're hit hard and hit fast.

     Novak's worry intensifies.

                    REID (CONT'D)
          Stargher's neurological system was
          infected by a virus in utero.  It lay
          dormant.  In his case for about...
               (guesses at Stargher's age)
          ...thirty years.  Most likely, he's
          exhibited symptoms for awhile now, but
          the infraction - the breach - didn't
          occur 'til today.  You never know when
          it'll happen, at what age, or why.  The
          triggers vary, but the results don't.
               (fascinated by Stargher)
          He has no ties to reality.  No awareness
          of this world or the people in it.

                    TEDDY LEE
          What about Thorazine? Or... Desoxyn?

                    REID
          The normal psychotropics don't work. 
          He's not just catatonic, he's...
          disappeared.  Like having a dream and
          never waking up.

                    NOVAK
          This girl.  Julia Hickson.  Only he
          knows where she is.

                    REID
          Then I'm sorry.  For her and for you.

     Novak is past angry.  He's bordering on devastation.  Ramsey
     attempts to placate him.

                    RAMSEY
          We'll go back to his house, Pete. 
          There's still a lot to do.  Analyze the
          videos, track sales of the bleach, go
          through his records.  Maybe he owns
          property somewhere.

                    NOVAK
          They're in that fucking thing for forty
          hours, Gordon.  Four-oh.  He got Julia
          at seven-thirty last night.  You know
          what time it is now...?!

     Ramsey backs off, knowing his partner is on the verge of
     really losing it.  Reid thinks perhaps he shouldn't, but
     sensitive to Novak's pain and anger, mentions it anyway - if
     only to keep his friend from true hopelessness.

                    REID
          Peter?  This is a longshot.  I mean a
          real long shot.  You're gonna think I'm
          crazy...

     EXT. EDWARD'S WORLD - DAY

     The ship's engine ROARS TO LIFE and the PROPELLER spins
     through sand.

                    CATHERINE (O.S.)
          It's fixed!

     AT THE TREE TRUNK, Catherine extends her hand and suddenly
     Edward is there, quite close, reaching out.  Catherine's hand
     trembles.  The boy is startled.

                    CATHERINE (CONT'D)
               (surprised, to herself)
          I'm not signalling...

     Her hand tenses and shakes uncontrollably.

                    VOICE (O.S.)
          Sing a song of sixpence...

                    CATHERINE
               (angry, to the heavens)
          I'm not signalling!

     Edward is frightened by what's happening and runs away. 
     Catherine tries to call out, but her throat constricts,
     making speech difficult.

                    CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          I'm not...
               
               
               
               INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY - DAY

     Catherine's face is covered by a cloth floating down from the
     sky.  The sky is replaced by the ceiling and overhead lights
     of the LABORATORY, but Miriam's face remains constant.  Now
     conscious, Catherine finds herself in the lab at the Campbell
     Center, the suspension device lowering.

                    MIRIAM
               (on intercom)
          Sing a song of sixpence.

                    CATHERINE
               (hoarse)
          A pocketful of fucking rye.
               (worried)
          What's wrong?

                    MIRIAM
               (cagey)
          Nothing.

                    CATHERINE
               (disappointed)
          Why did we stop?

     Cooperman appears in the window and explains.

                    COOPERMAN
               (on intercom)
          I asked them to.
               (with gravity)
          We have a situation.

     INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

     A SMALL TV SCREEN shows footage of Anne drowning in the cell. 
     Catherine, Cooperman, Henry, and Miriam watch with curiosity,
     disgust, pity.  Novak and Ramsey flank the portable
     monitor/VCR, knowing this is a disturbing but powerful tool. 
     There's someone else in the room.  John Tracy.  He cannot
     watch the video, not again.  Catherine glances at him,
     uncomfortable with his presence.

                    MIRIAM
          When did he lapse into the coma?

                    NOVAK
          Sometime yesterday morning.

     John tries to keep his composure, but Novak's making this
     tough for him.  Novak wants the scientists to see, to
     understand the boy's pain.

                    NOVAK (CONT'D)
          Each tape is the same.  He provides
          food, drinking water, a toilet. 
          Periodically, a shower starts.  It's on
          some kind of timer - he's clever with
          machines, building things.  I think he
          wants them to believe this is a simple
          kidnapping.  That there's a possibility
          of rescue.  Of survival.  But it's just
          a form of torture.  At the end of the
          fortieth hour, the drain shuts.  The
          water starts and doesn't stop.
               (gravely)
          We've already lost more than a day.  If
          she isn't found tonight.  She dies like
          the rest.

                    COOPERMAN
               (to Miriam, Henry and
               Catherine)
          John and Ella Baines - as well as the
          Sunerset Board of Directors - have given
          their approval, but the decision is
          yours.

                    MIRIAM
          What about the legalities of this...?

                    NOVAK
          Stargher is in custody.  The functional
          equivalent of being under arrest. 
          Normally, we'd Mirandize him, and if he
          didn't lawyer up, we'd interrogate him. 
          But because of his condition, he doesn't
          have the capacity to waive those rights.

                    HENRY
          So what you're asking us to do is
          illegal?

                    NOVAK
          No, not at all.
               (explains)
          We're dealing with exigent
          circumstances.  Somewhere there's a
          kidnapped woman still alive.  If we
          weigh the suspect's Constitutional
          Rights against the public safety. 
          The Law favors the victim and gives us a
          lot of leeway.  It's called the Public
          Safety Exception.

                    COOPERMAN
          So what can you do?

                    NOVAK
          Pretty much anything we want.  There's a
          chance to save a human life.  Because of
          that, Stargher has no reasonable
          expectation of privacy.

     Miriam, Henry and Cooperman appear to be onboard.  Novak's
     made a persuasive, heartfelt argument.  Only one person still
     remains uncertain.

                    CATHERINE
          What if...?

     All eyes turn to her.

                    CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          What if he wasn't like this?  What if he
          was "normal?"  Conscious.  How far would
          you go?

                    NOVAK
          As far as I needed.

     Catherine nods, analyzes Novak's eyes, gestures, body
     language, and "interrogates" him.

                    CATHERINE
          Do you think he'd tell you what you need
          to know?

     John's discomfort is increasing and Novak is sensitive to it.

                    NOVAK
          There's always a chance they'll confess.

                    CATHERINE
          Really?  I don't work with violent
          cases, I work with children.  But even a
          kid lies.  They love it when they get
          you to believe something that isn't
          true.  Don't you think Stargher would do
          the same?

                    NOVAK
          Sometimes... Once they've been caught
          they feel a need for disclosure.  They
          have so much they want to tell. 
          But they've never had a sympathetic ear. 
          They need someone to understand why.
               (focusing on Catherine)
          Stargher used to hide the bodies very
          carefully.  It was part of the ritual. 
          Some weren't found for weeks and any
          physical evidence had been meticulously
          wiped clean.  But these last three...
          They were still in water - always in
          water - but
               (clarifies)
          Listen, he wasn't just careless.  It
          went beyond that...

                    CATHERINE
          Okay.  Let's assume he wanted you to
          find him, that some part of him hated
          what he was doing... Most likely, that
          part is dead.  Schizophrenics with
          Whalen's Infraction sever all ties with
          the real world.  I'm sorry, I really am.

                    RAMSEY
          Is it possible?

                    CATHERINE
          If he came to trust me, yes, but it
          takes months to build that kind of
          trust.  Someone like Stargher can't
          distinguish between fantasy and reality. 
          It's all the same.  He might tell me
          she's in Timbuktu and absolutely, one
          hundred percent believe it to be true,
          but she's...

                    JOHN (O.S.)
          Julia.

     They turn to John Tracy.  His vulnerable, barely audible
     voice forcing everyone to listen.

                    JOHN (CONT'D)
          Not "she."  Julia.  Not thing, or it, or
          her.  Do you know anything about her? 
          Do you know what we've been through? 
          Julia is everything to me.  Can you say
          that about anyone?  

     Catherine hangs her head.  And finds herself looking at
     photograph of the girl in question.  A smiling Julia Hickson
     looking right at her.

     WHOOP-WHOOP-WHOOP-WHOOP.  POUNDING REVERBERATIONS...

     EXT. CAMPBELL CENTER - DAY

     WHOOP-WHOOP-WHOOP-WHOOP.  A HELICOPTER descends onto the pad. 
     A stretcher is removed from the side door of the helicopter.

     INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - VARIOUS/TRAVELLING - DAY

     The STAFF watches with a mixture of fear and curiosity as a
     stretcher bearing the catatonic Stargher is wheeled FAST
     through the corridors by an FBI escort team.

     INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

     Hundreds of photographs, drawings, diagrams, maps,
     blueprints, and documents - Novak's case material - cover
     every inch of wallspace.  The table is littered with
     reference books, atlases, telephones, a fax machine, short
     wave radio, and computer/Internet terminal.  An FBI
     TECHNICIAN completes the electronics work and points out the
     "speed dial" functions to Novak and Ramsey.

                    FBI TECH

          That gets you into the Bureau Database.

                    NOVAK
          Thanks.

     Once he's gone, Ramsey takes this moment "alone" to question
     his partner.

                    RAMSEY
          You sure you want to go through with
          this?

                    NOVAK
          What else do we do?!

                    RAMSEY
          I don't know, Pete, but for god's
          sake... This is nuts.  Do you really
          understand what they're going to do?

                    NOVAK
          I don't have to.

                    RAMSEY
          Why jeopardize what we've already done? 
          We caught the sonofabitch.  Carl
          Stargher.  That's going to be like
          Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer.  A case that makes
          careers.  But if we push our luck.  If
          this is all bullshit and we come out
          smelling like it.

                    NOVAK
          Tell you what.  If this thing burns us,
          I take that heat.  I give you permission
          to point your finger at me and say "It
          was all his idea."

                    RAMSEY
               (offended)
          That's not what I'm talking about, Pete. 
          I'm talking about waking up and
          realizing this girl's gonna die.

     The words are anathema to Novak.

                    NOVAK
          That won't happen.

     Cooperman appears in the doorway and informs them...

                    COOPERMAN
          They're ready.

     Ramsey looks to his partner, but Novak is already on
     Cooperman's heels.  Resignedly, Ramsey follows.

     INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY - DAY

     Cooperman guides Novak and Ramsey into the lab.  The FBI men
     are impressed, but neither is quite sure what to make it all. 
     The FBI escort team leader gets Ramsey's signature and Novak
     undoes the cuffs from Stargher's wrists and ankles. 
     Following Miriam's direction, the escorts guide the gurney
     carrying Stargher into the procedure room.  As Cooperman
     shows them out, Henry seals shut the door.  Miriam assumes
     responsibility for Stargher's care and checks his pulse, IV,
     pupil dilation, and vital signs...

                    HENRY
          Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?

                    MIRIAM
          They took care of that, thank you,
          Henry.
               (getting him out of her hair)

                    MIRIAM (CONT'D)
          Why don't you give our guests a little
          tour?

     Proud of his computer, but uncomfortable around strangers,
     Henry directs Novak and Ramsey to the console.

                    HENRY
          Gentlemen, you stand before the one and
          only Neurological Cartography and
          Synaptic Transfer System.

     Although he's listening, Novak's eyes never really stray from
     his prisoner as Miriam uses safety scissors to cut away
     Stargher's clothes.

                    HENRY (CONT'D)
          It provides a highly detailed map of the
          human mind.  Not the brain - any MRI can
          do that.  The mind.
               (self-impressed)
          It reads and processes electronically
          allowing information to be transferred
          and interrupted.
               (for the laymen)
          Let's say your thoughts could be stored
          on DVD.  If someone had the right kind
          of player, they could watch and listen
          to what you're thinking.

     Novak observes Miriam as she "undresses" Stargher and Ramsey
     pokes around the lab.

                    HENRY (CONT'D)
          But we can't record or store the data. 
          The connections between nerve cells are
          constantly being modified.

     Miriam needs a moment to fully take in the scars.  Henry
     continues, eager to focus attention back to him, but even he
     is fascinated by Stargher's skin.

                    HENRY (CONT'D)
          It's like the early days of television. 
          The subject sends out a live feed and
          you receive it during time of broadcast. 
          Whatever happens, happens.  All you have
          to do is "tune in."

     Miriam gives Stargher an alcohol bath, the clinical procedure
     taking on the quality of ritual.  Her wash cloth moves under
     Stargher's chin and over his face.  She's careful around the
     eyes and finds herself unable to look at them for long.

                    HENRY (CONT'D)
          But you do more than tune in... You
          become part of the snow.

     Catherine enters from a dressing area wearing the bodysuit. 
     Filled with curiosity, Novak watches Miriam and Catherine fit
     Stargher into his suit.

                    NOVAK
          I still don't understand why I can't do
          this... This isn't some "troubled kid"
          you're dealing with.

                    CATHERINE
          I realize that...

                    NOVAK
          How hard could it be...?

     Catherine and Miriam try to hide their laughter.

                    CATHERINE
          The first... What?  Six or seven times I
          went in.   Remember what happened?

                    MIRIAM
          Disorientation, nausea, migraines,
          hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.

                    CATHERINE
          Like a New Year's Day hangover.

                    MIRIAM
          He needs to be turned over.

     Novak and Catherine roll Stargher onto his stomach.

                    NOVAK
          This man is deeply disturbed, he...

                    CATHERINE
          You don't know the procedure.

                    NOVAK
          I know him.

                    MIRIAM
          That may be true, but you don't have
          Catherine's gift.  She...
               (distracted by Stargher's back)
          What happened here?

     We see a series of EIGHT BANDAGES.

                    RAMSEY
          We removed eight metal rings.

     Miriam peels away a bandage and examines the flesh.

                    CATHERINE
          Then he should like this.

     Catherine connects Stargher to the SUSPENSION APPARATUS and
     it HOISTS him off the table.

                    CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          They're comforted by the feeling of
          weightlessness.  Like floating in water.

     Henry catches Ramsey poking his nose near a THIRD SUIT AND
     APPARATUS in the dressing area.

                    HENRY
          Don't touch that, please.

                    RAMSEY
          Sorry.

     Miriam prepares a series of CHEMICAL CARTRIDGES and loads
     them into a container connected to the IV-like tubes linked
     to the suspension device.

                    MIRIAM
               (intimate, quiet)
          This isn't your responsibility. 
          Remember that.  Don't let them use guilt
          as a tool.  If you want to stop, say so.

                    CATHERINE
          I'll be fine.

                    MIRIAM
          She said convincingly.

     Catherine focuses on the procedure and makes the necessary
     connections.  Reluctantly, Miriam retreats to the monitoring
     station.  She "locks down" the procedure room and joins
     Henry, Novak, and Ramsey at the console.

                    NOVAK
               (eyes on the chemical/drug
               monitors)
          That's the stuff?

                    HENRY
          About twelve years of research, right
          Miriam?

                    MIRIAM
          Don't remind me.

                    RAMSEY
          What is it - are they - exactly?

     That's like asking her to explain the rules of cricket.

                    MIRIAM
          Psychostimulants, serotonin,
          stabilizers, meprobamate, Neurontin,
          lithium carbonate.  And my baby.  It
          duplicates and expands upon the effects
          of a chemical called oxytocin, forcing a
          break in the neuron connections that
          hold experience.  So new experience can
          form.

     Ramsey is utterly lost and just sort of nods, but Novak is
     fascinated.  Catherine presses the bump on her hand.  A RED
     INDICATOR LIGHT flashes on.

                    HENRY
          There's a touch-sensitive microchip
          implanted in her hand.  If she becomes
          frightened, disoriented, or simply wants
          to end the session, she signals us to
          abort.

     Catherine presses again and the red light shuts off.

                    MIRIAM
          Although none of what she experiences is
          real, she can be tricked into thinking
          it is.  The mind is awfully gullible, so
          she needs to monitor herself.

     Catherine and Stargher are suspended from the ceiling.  Henry
     types and the lights dim to a more somber, tranquil level. 
     Various screens flicker to life, displaying the vital signs
     of both "feed" and receive."  Miriam initiates the injection
     program.

                    MIRIAM (CONT'D)
          Catherine?  I'm about to start.  If you
          want me to wait, or...

                    CATHERINE
          No.  No.

     IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, we see chemicals mix with her blood,
     then feed the IV.  AT THE CONSOLE, as Henry types furiously
     at the computer keyboard, Novak asks Miriam:

                    NOVAK
          You said she has a "gift."

     Overhearing, Henry interrupts, pointing at a section of
     Catherine's "mind map."

                    HENRY
          Not a gift.  A highly evolved area in
          her cerebral cortex, that's all.  A
          genetic fluke.

                    MIRIAM
          Catherine has a tremendous capacity for
          empathy.
               (clarifies)
          When we started, there were a number of
          test subjects - other therapists - who
          acted as "receivers."  All they did was
          observe and report.  Nothing more.  But
          Catherine, she had the ability to feel
          what was happening.  She understood. 
          And the patient responded.  Edward
          engaged her in dialogue, took her
          places, showed her things.  He knew she
          cared.

     A hopeful, solemn Novak gazes through the window, watching
     Catherine's body as it becomes parallel to Stargher's...

     IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Catherine takes a deep breath and as
     the drugs take effect, feels herself losing consciousness. 
     She glances at Stargher, a man who tortures and kills women,
     then looks up as the CLOTH MASK descends from the ceiling.

                    MIRIAM (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Intravenous administration complete.

                    HENRY (O.S.)
          Initiating connection.

     We follow fibrous wires running from Catherine's mask to
     Stargher's.  Their blood mixing with chemicals in the IV-like
     containers.  The computer system humming.

                    HENRY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Transfer begins 1100 hours, 34 minutes,
          12 seconds.

     Catherine's eye focuses on the mask.  As it comes closer, we
     see the lining is laced with thread-like wires and microchips
     forming hyper-miniature circuit boards.  Catherine's eye
     blinks.  The mask covers her face.  Catherine's eye shuts.

     Vision fades.  Darkness.  A faint light.  Microscopic veins
     in the eyelid become wires connected to chips.  And we're
     MOVING, into the circuitry.

     ENTRANCE ONE

     INT. STARGHER'S WORLD

     The pattern of the electronics grows into something more
     organic, textured, concrete.  Evolving into a world.  Black
     and shadow-filled, it resembles a labyrinthine complex of
     vertical walls with cubicle like rooms carved deep into its
     core.

     Our journey into this bleak, grim place continues and we
     occasionally glimpse brief images of a boy's baptism.

     INTERCUT with this journey are sections of cloudy blackness
     and fragmented visions of CATHERINE connected to the
     apparatus, face masked, DESCENDING into this world.

     There is an abrupt SHIFT from still images to regular motion
     and we find ourselves gliding over a tidepool filled with
     tiny fish and tadpoles.  At water's edge, lying on rough,
     pebble-strewn ground, is a HAND.

     Catherine's hand.  We sense MOVEMENT, but she remains still. 
     From the darkness comes a DOG.  Black in color and
     featureless, it sniffs Catherine, dismisses her, and meanders
     into a cubicle opposite her, disappearing from view.  After a
     moment of odd quiet, a DROP OF BLOOD hits the mask and we
     follow Catherine's hand as it moves to the cloth and removes
     it from her own face.

     IN MACROSCOPIC SUPER SLOW-MOTIONS, another BLOOD DROPLET
     sails 64 into the air and comes crashing down, hitting a RED
     ANT, catapulting it onto what looks like a tree, but is just
     a TWIG.  As the insect scurries away, MORE DROPS pound the
     earth, splatter against "twig trees," and explode into pools
     of stagnant water...

     As we begin to realize that this miniature landscape is the
     world into which Catherine descended.

     She sits up, shivering, and breathes deeply, acclimating to
     her surroundings.  The "floor" is covered with filth, ash,
     pebbles, and insects.  Water is present in many forms,
     puddles, moisture, dripping ceilings.

     Eyes focusing, queasy, not fully "awake," Catherine notices
     the crimson stain on the cloth mask and the blood droplets
     showering the air.  She turns and finds the source.

     THE BLACK DOG stands in the opposite room next to a tub full
     of BLOOD, shaking himself dry after his "bath."  Satisfied,
     the animal stops and trots away.  Still adjusting to this
     nightmarish realm, Catherine at first doesn't hear it, but
     then realizes that somewhere, a child is CRYING.  She looks
     around, then through a crack in the "floor," briefly catches
     sight of a BOY beneath her, on a level lower than hers.  As
     he disappears into corridor ending in "nothing," we PULL BACK
     to show a MASSIVE LANDSCAPE of blocks, cubicles, crawlspace,
     walls, stairs, and ladders.  Leading everywhere and nowhere.

     Catherine spots the boy as he crawls into a specific "room." 
     Shortly after, a LIGHT comes on within the cubicle and she
     moves to it.  We feel as though we're looking at a series of
     interlocked tenement rooms, some walls of which have been
     torn away to expose rooms within, rooms with no windows or
     doors.  Following a path of fragile steps, Catherine makes
     her way to the LIGHTED ROOM and enters.

     INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - LIGHTED ROOM

     A mottled HORSE stands with its head down, nose kissing the
     floor, allowing the BOY to caress its neck.  This sweet
     animal is an incrongruous vision in this hellish world and
     Catherine approaches with respect.

                    CATHERINE
          Hello?

     The frightened child retreats into a corner of the
     claustrophobic room, but the horse does not startle. 
     Surprisingly - to the boy - the horse takes an affectionate
     step toward Catherine, inviting her to take over.  Catherine
     allows the mare to smell her, then vigorously scratches along
     the mane and shoulder, much to the horse's delight.

                    CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          Yeah, you like that, don't you?

     She can see the boy hiding in the corner, stealing glances at
     her from the shadows.

                    CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          Is your name Carl?

     The boy - YOUNG STARGHER - is startled and intrigued by the
     question - How did she know that?! - but says nothing.

                    CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          Another little boy I know, he has a
          horse, too.

     The boy reacts to an unusual SOUND coming from the CEILING.

                    CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          His name's Edward.  The boy, not the
          horse...

     The boy takes a few steps toward her, out of the shadows, but
     he seems more concerned about something in the ceiling than
     "connecting" with Catherine.  Very anxiously, he looks at the
     wall behind Catherine and watches an old wind-up kitchen
     TIMER click down.

                    CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          What's the matter, Carl?

     Again, a sharp SOUND from the ceiling.

                    CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          What's wro---?

     Young Stargher RUNS at her and SHOVES her hard!  Catherine
     FALLS BACK just as EIGHT SHEETS OF GLASS drop from the
     ceiling!  Like oversize razor blades, they slice the horse
     into four clean sections.  They separate and compact the
     quadrants until four glass-contained sections of dissected
     horse stand within the room.  Catherine SCREAMS, but the mare
     barely acknowledged what happened.  Betraying no emotion, the
     boy runs.  The shaken Catherine takes a moment to collect
     herself, then gives chase.

     INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - THE LABYRINTH

     Young Stargher knows his way around the landscape, but
     Catherine has difficulty simply keeping him in sight.  She
     runs, climbs and crawls.  Until she's utterly lost and
     disoriented.  Tired and having difficulty breathing, she
     drops to her knees and "cools down."  She hears a NOISE
     nearby, gets to her feet, and finds a GEARED MECHANISM
     connected to some kind of SHUTTERED DOOR composed of an
     almost metallic-looking glass.  Curious yet cautious, she
     examines the nearby walls, floor, and ceiling for any signs
     of "traps" akin to the glass blades.  Finding none, she pulls
     the mechanism and quickly steps back.

     The shutter opens and Catherine knows there's something alive
     in the tiny cubicle beyond.  She retreats into shadow,
     hiding.  Released from the chamber is a WOMAN.  As she moves
     out of a darkness, we see VICTIM ONE.

     Ghostly pale and adorned in eerie fetish garb, she appears to
     "sense" the presence of a stranger, targets Catherine in the
     shadows, and ATTACKS!

     Catherine's had enough and moves to press the implant, BUT
     THE VICTIM IS ALREADY THERE! 
     She brutally grabs Catherine, THROWS her against the wall and
     SMACKS her head against it.  Catherine drops to the floor
     like a rag doll.

     Victim One hefts Catherine onto her shoulder and with great
     purpose, carries her deep into the labyrinth, toward the
     core.  Passing in and out of consciousness, between darkness
     and light, a dazed Catherine is taken on a "tour" of
     Stargher's world.  Passing mausoleum-like chambers filled
     with IMAGES of unspeakable horror and/or disturbing
     intensity.  At one of the rooms, we think we see Young
     Stargher silently observing...

     Sitting of standing in individual cubicles are STARGHER'S
     OTHER VICTIMS (TWO thru SIX), each woman resembling the
     grotesque porcelain dolls glimpsed in the cubbyholes in
     Stargher's basement.  Dressed by a fetishistic sadist (Nine
     Inch Nails meets the Brides of Dracula), they resemble bored
     housewives, barely acknowledging the new member of the
     "harem."
     
     
     INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - THE CORE

     VICTIM ONE drops Catherine in the center of the room and, job
     done, crawls away.

     Groggy, feeling sick, Catherine sits up.  Unbeknownst to her,
     she is sitting at the base of a pedestal with her back to the
     kind of THRONE.  And someone is there.  In the dim pool of
     light above the pedestal, we see a MAN rise from the throne. 
     The wall behind him is covered in BLOOD RED CLOTH, and as he
     descends, we realize it is a CAPE connected to EIGHT METAL
     RINGS pierced through the flesh of his back.  In a fluid
     motion, waves of red give way to harshly textured concrete as
     the man reaches the floor.  Catherine knows he is there. 
     Unable to stop herself, she turns.  And sees the terrifying
     face of STARGHER.  But no the same Stargher.

     This is STARGHER KING.

                    STARGHER KING
               (primitive, guttural)
          Where you come from priddy thing?

     In a split second, Catherine presses the implant on her hand.

     INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

     Apparently capable of staying awake if properly caffeinated,
     Novak sits cross-legged on the floor, shoes off, analyzing
     RECENT PHOTOS AND DOCUMENTS sent to him via courier. 
     Ignoring a snoring Ramsey napping on a nearby cot, Novak
     looks at blow-ups from the videos, blueprints of Stargher's
     house, detailed shots of the basement, and a draftsman's
     conceptual drawing of the cell itself.

                    HENRY (V.O.)
          Gentlemen?

     Novak looks at an INTERCOM SPEAKER.

                    HENRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          She's back.

     Novak doesn't wait for his just-stirring partner and moves.

     INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY

     As he enters, Novak sees a concerned Henry checking a print
     out of the procedure.

                    NOVAK
          What happened?

                    HENRY
          Must've been rather unusual.

     Noting Novak's confusion, Henry points to a CENTRAL MONITOR
     resembling a futuristic V.U. meter, gradiated in sections of
     white, yellow, orange, and red.

                    HENRY (CONT'D)
               (re: white/yellow area)
          If her neural activity stays within this
          range, I know she's self-cognitive.
               (clarifies)
          As if she were having a dream, but she
          knows she's dreaming.  She can "wake up"
          any time she wants to...

     As Ramsey joins them, Novak nods, understanding, but his eyes
     are on Catherine, who's just coming back to consciousness.

                    HENRY (CONT'D)
               (re: orange section)
          However, if her level of involvement is
          rather intense, as it was just now, she
          can perceive things as true.  It's
          difficult to keep perspective.

     As Novak lingers on that question, Ramsey gestures at the red
     section.

                    RAMSEY
          What happens here?

                    HENRY
          We don't talk about that.

                    NOVAK
          What happens?

                    HENRY
          Well, Theoretically, while she's inside. 
          If she came to believe that Stargher's
          world is her world, her mind has the
          power to convince the body that anything
          done to it is, um, actually done.

     Novak doesn't like the sound of that.

                    HENRY (CONT'D)
          That's why we monitor the use of the
          drugs so closely.  We don't want her
          getting to that degree of perceptual
          disorientation.

                    MIRIAM
          Pump in two liters of pure oxygen,
          please Henry.

     Henry types a command and Novak speaks into the intercom.

                    NOVAK
          Dr. Kent?

     IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Miriam eases Catherine back to
     consciousness.

                    MIRIAM
          Deep breaths.

     When she sees Stargher, Catherine's flesh crawls.

                    CATHERINE
          Is it cold in here?

                    MIRIAM
          What happened?

     No response.

                    MIRIAM (CONT'D)
          What's wrong?

     Incapable of being in the same room as him, Catherine tears
     out of the apparatus and anxiously exits.

                    MIRIAM (CONT'D)
          Catherine!

     IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM:

                    NOVAK
          I'll get her...

     INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - DAY

     A worried Novak searches the halls of the Campbell Center. 
     He's about to ask the staff for help, but stops when he sees
     through the window to Edward's room.

     INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - EDWARD'S ROOM

     Catherine sits next to the boy's bed, holding Edward's hand,
     softly singing a lullaby (to him, to herself).  Feeling that
     he must speak to her, Novak intervenes.

                    NOVAK
          Edward Baines, I presume.
               (to the catatonic child)
          Hi, Ed.  I'm Pete.

                    CATHERINE
          Do you think that's funny?

                    NOVAK
          No.  Not at all.  From what I
          understand, he knows I"m here, isn't
          that right?

     Catherine nods.  Novak picks up Edward's fallen teddy bear
     and rests it in the crook of the child's arm.

                    NOVAK (CONT'D)
          I read about a woman in TExas who was in
          a coma for seven years.  Every time her
          husband came to visit, her heart would
          beat faster.  Isn't that something?  I
          don't know what name scientists have for
          something like that...

                    CATHERINE
          It doesn't have much to do with science.

                    NOVAK
          What then?

                    CATHERINE
          The soul.  The spirit.  Whatever you
          want to call it.

                    NOVAK
          Ah, the part of us that can't be
          explained.

     She appreciates his understanding.  And finds herself
     comforted by his presence.  Catherine scrutinizes Novak, his
     intensity, his honesty, his complexity.  And asks:

                    CATHERINE
          Agent Novak?

                    NOVAK
          Peter, okay?

                    CATHERINE
          Do you feel there's a side of yourself
          you don't show people?

     The question catches Novak off-guard, but he's willing to
     answer.  Anything to get her talking.

                    NOVAK
          Absolutely.
               (realizing it's too personal)
          I suppose everyone does.

                    CATHERINE
          Just like we all have fantasies, right? 
          Things only we know, that we don't
          share.

                    NOVAK
          That's what therapists are for, right?

     Catherine laughs.  It helps her relax.  If only slightly.

                    CATHERINE
          During the sessions.  When I'm inside. 
          I see those things.  What a person
          hides, what they despite, what they want
          to control.  With Stargher...

     This is difficult for her.

                    CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          With Stargher I saw things...

                    NOVAK
          What did you see?

                    CATHERINE
               (professionally)
          A kingdom.  His utopia. 
          Life without consequence or restriction. 
          He's not even Carl Stargher anymore. 
          He's this... idealized version of
          himself who can do anything he
          pleases... Without fear.  A horrible
          primitive ugly thing.
               (uncomfortable; re: Edward)
          I don't want to talk in here.

     She kisses Edward's forehead and exits.

     INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - CONFERENCE ROOM/COURTYARD - DAY

     Catherine and Novak sit on a bench in the center of the
     courtyard.  John Tracy is visible in the reception area,
     unable to sleep, desperately trying to fight frustration.

                    CATHERINE
          Why'd you bring him here?

                    NOVAK
          You're the shrink, you tell me.

                    CATHERINE
               (already knows)
          As soon as I met him, you knew I'd say
          yes.  He makes Julia real for me.

     Novak nods.  Guilty.

                    NOVAK
          It's an old lawyer trick.  Target the
          emotions.  Do it right, you get a
          reluctant witness to testify, a scared
          kid to confess.

     Catherine looks at him with disbelief.  "You?!"

                    NOVAK (CONT'D)
          Before I was with the Bureau, I was an
          attorney, a prosecutor.  Mr. Law and
          Order.  And then... I had a murder case
          in North Carolina.  Charles Gish. 
          Butchered seventeen people in three
          days.  And because of one tiny piece of
          tainted evidence, he walked.
               (no regrets)
          That's when I quit the DA's office and
          joined the FBI.

     Catherine can see the pain and frustration in Novak's eyes. 
     She gives him a moment and asks:

                    CATHERINE
          You thought Stargher wanted to be
          caught.

                    NOVAK
          I did, yeah.

                    CATHERINE
          You were right.  There's a part of him
          that knows the truth.  About what he
          did, about himself.

     Novak's curiosity is piqued.

                    NOVAK
          What about Julia?

                    CATHERINE
          This is going to sound terrible, but...
          I don't think she matters anymore.  Not
          to him.  He never finished her.  The
          others...he was able to make them his.

                    NOVAK
          You think you can do this, don't you?

                    CATHERINE
          He might tell me about Julia.  The part
          of him that wants to help, that feels
          shame and remorse.  Who wants to be
          redeemed.

                    NOVAK
               (skeptically)
          This is Stargher we're talking about?

                    CATHERINE
          Not Stargher, not really.  He's split
          himself right down the middle. 
          Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. 
          A monster.  And an innocent child.  If I
          could reach the boy.

                    NOVAK
          Whoa.  Hold on.  Aren't they the same
          guy?

                    CATHERINE
          Don't you feel there are different sides
          to every personality?  Maybe even the
          worst of us is capable of one decent
          act.  We're all human.

                    NOVAK
          It's hard for me to see Stargher as
          human, capable of something like
          "remorse."

                    CATHERINE
          Then what is he?

                    NOVAK
          Evil.

                    CATHERINE
          If you believe that.

                    NOVAK
          Maybe this is a big fucking waste of
          time.

                    CATHERINE
               (sensing something)
          What happened to Charles Gish?

     Novak doesn't respond.  She prods him.

                    CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          What happened?

                    NOVAK
          What difference does it make...?

                    CATHERINE
          Tell me.

     God, he does not want to do this.

                    NOVAK
          Right after the trial, the night after
          he was released.  Mr. and Mrs. Frank
          Simmons found Charlie sitting in their
          living room watching TV with their
          twelve-year old daughter Margaret.  He'd
          cut her right down the middle with a
          carving knife.

                    NOVAK (CONT'D)
          Found the girl's heart in the freezer -
          he thought they might want to keep it.
               (grim humor)
          Luckily, the next thing he did was slit
          his own throat.
               (bleakly)
          I am convinced of one thing. 
          Charles Gish could've been raised by
          Ozzie and Harriet and the same thing
          would've happened.

     He can see Catherine doesn't accept that.

                    NOVAK (CONT'D)
          A child can experience abuse worse than
          Charlie's.  And grow up to be someone
          who would never, ever hurt another
          living thing.

                    CATHERINE
          You're sure of that?

                    NOVAK
          Yes.  I am.

     Catherine realizes that was a confession.

                    RAMSEY (O.S.)
          Where the hell you been?

     They turn to see Ramsey.

                    NOVAK
          Right here.

                    RAMSEY
          Next time, tell me, okay?

                    NOVAK
          But you looked so cute.  All sleepy...

     Ramsey shoots him a murderous look, then asks Catherine.

                    RAMSEY
          Your colleagues want to know what to do
          with Stargher.

     Novak looks to Catherine for the answer.  Through the window
     blinds, she watches John Tracy lower his head.

                    CATHERINE
          Tell them to prep him.  And that I'll be
          right there.

     Ramsey nods and heads back to the lab.

                    NOVAK
          Thank you.

     Briefly, he touches her hand.  Catherine looks away from John
     to Novak's hand, to the photographs on the wall.  Stargher's
     house, Valentine, the pick-up truck.  Valentine...

                    CATHERINE
          I need something.

     INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - CORRIDOR - DAY

     A K-9 UNIT FBI AGENT escorts VALENTINE to the lab.

     INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY - DAY

     As the agent brings the frightened animal into the monitoring
     area, Catherine and Valentine share a moment of "connection." 
     Slowly, confidently, she approaches the Shepherd, kneels, and
     removes his leash and muzzle.  She strokes him and the dog
     instantly warms up to her.

                    FBI K-9 AGENT
          Sure wasn't like that with me.

     Novak signs a document and the K-9 Agent exits.

                    CATHERINE
          You're a good boy, aren't you,
          Valentine?

     The dog picks up a scent from the procedure room and moves
     it, Catherine and Novak following.

     IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Stargher lies face down on a gurney. 
     Now taped to the wall near Stargher are PICTURES from the
     basement - his dolls, the hoist, etc.  Miriam (in surgical
     mask and gloves) carefully re-inserts the METAL RINGS (taken
     from an FBI EVIDENCE BAG) into the eight straps of flesh on
     his back.  When he sees this, Valentine whimpers and hides. 
     Catherine comforts him.  Miriam finishes her task and removes
     her mask.

                    MIRIAM
          I hate to admit it, but there's
          something perversely satisfying about
          this.

                    HENRY
          I think that's the whole point.

     Valentine runs to his "sleeping" master and barks at
     Catherine as if asking for help.  She encourages the animal
     to lick and sniff Stargher's face and hands.

                    HENRY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          That's interesting.

     IN THE CONTROL ROOM, he scrutinizes the monitor showing the
     detailed "map" of Stargher's brain.

                    HENRY (CONT'D)
          Increased neural activity in the frontal
          lobes.  Rising dopamine levels in the
          basal ganglia.  Ever since the dog
          walked in.

     IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Catherine readies herself in the
     "receive" apparatus.  As Stargher is lifted off the pedestal,
     the doors HISS shut and Valentine curls up on the floor
     beneath his master.  As Catherine is lifted, she smiles at
     the animal, then looks to Stargher.

                    NOVAK
               (comforting and coaching her)
          Remember, Julia Hickson is priority
          number one.  Nothing else matters.  Find
          out where she is.

                    CATHERINE
          Okay, okay...

     LIGHTS FLICKER.  Catherine's eyes shut.  FADE TO BLACK...

                    HENRY (O.S.)
          Uh-oh...

     LIGHTS FLICKER.  We hear an ELECTRICAL HUM rise and fall. 
     Catherine opens her eyes and the LIGHTS blink on and off in a
     weird pattern, making it difficult to see clearly.

                    CATHERINE
          Don't kid around, Henry...

     Her suspension apparatus DESCENDS on the floor.

                    HENRY (O.S.)
          I'm not.  It's a power problem.  I need
          you to go to the circuit breaker and
          check switches six through twelve.

     Catherine moves toward the electrical panel.

                    HENRY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Try to stay awake, okay?

                    CATHERINE
          Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm not sleepy.

     As she moves toward the panel, everything becomes larger.  By
     the time Catherine reaches the circuit breaker, it is the
     size of a garage door.  Curiouser and curiouser...

     She turns around to see the LABORATORY IS EMPTY and DEAD
     QUIET.  And she sees herself - Catherine as small as a mouse
     trapped in a giant walled space.

     AT THE CONSOLE, Novak, Miriam and Henry observe the procedure
     room.  And Catherine.  Suspended in the apparatus. 
     Motionless...

     ENTRANCE TWO

     INT. STARGHER'S WORLD

     Catherine turns to see... Catherine lying in the fetal
     position, locked in a BOX made of thick clean glass.  The
     electronic HUM becomes RHYTHMIC, AMBIENT NOISE.. INSIDE THE
     BOX, staying calm, she searches for and finds a TRAP DOOR on
     the floor.  She pushes out.  The camera executes a complete
     180-degree perspective change.

     Catherine plummets.  She tries to reach out, to stop her
     descent, but cannot.

     Catherine falls through a dark CAVERNOUS ROOM resembling a
     mammoth hollowed-out rib cage.  Below her is a DOME-LIKE
     STRUCTURE "growing" out of the floor, a HOLE in the center of
     its crest.  Dozens of other such domes are visible in the
     murky hell-hole, but Catherine has no choice.  She's dropping
     into this one.

     Once she passes through the hole, INSIDE THE DOME,
     Catherine's body looks as though it's moving through water,
     but there is no water.  Like an aerial artist, she reverses
     her position so she's "heads up."  Standing, stable, on the
     floor.  Sensing something with her.  And knows it is...

                    CATHERINE
          Valentine?

     Out from the darkness, moving in normal motion, comes the
     white German Shepherd, but in the thick haze, his face is
     indistinct and ghostly.

                    CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          Hi sweetie...

     And as she steps toward him, his face DISSOLVES into a STARK
     LANDSCAPE.  An ear becomes a hill, the nose a stone, mouth a
     path, and the eye a HOUSE. 
     YOUNG STARGHER retreats towards the bleak structure as
     CATHERINE ENTERS FRAME.  Seeing the invitation, she presses
     on.

     INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - BOYHOOD HOME - KITCHEN

     Young Stargher is at the sink WASHING DISHES, an anxious eye
     on the clock.

                    CATHERINE
          Need some help?

     As Catherine enters the claustrophobic house, the boy
     hesitantly pushes a towel toward her, but doesn't look.  She
     reaches the counter and starts to dry, much to Young
     Stargher's relief.  As he washes, Catherine hands him a
     MIRROR LOCKET just like Edward's.

                    CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          Carl, I want to give you a present.

     He's hypnotized by the thing, his eyes lighting up.

                    CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          If you need me, or if you feel that I'm
          around but can't find me, just shine it,
          like this.

     She shines reflected light onto the walls.  Carl hands
     Catherine the wet plate and takes the locket.  The dish slips
     from her fingers and SHATTERS on the floor.  The boy's eyes
     fill with dread.  The kitchen clock reads 5:30.  He PUSHES
     Catherine toward a broom closet and shoves her inside.

                    CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          What's wrong honey?

     With a finger to his lips, he pockets the locket and shuts
     the door.  FROM WITHIN THE CLOSET, she watches the terrified
     child through a CRACK in the door.  IN THE KITCHEN, Young
     Stargher desperately tries to hide the broken plate. 
     Startlingly, his father, Martin Stargher, is already in the
     room.  Cruel, imposing, manipulative man.

                    MARTIN
          What did you do know?  You make a mess? 
          I hate a mess.

     Young Stargher backs into a corner, fearing what will come.

                    MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Don't lie, now, Carl.

     IN THE CLOSET, Catherine pushes, but the door won't budge. 
     She POUNDS.  IN THE KITCHEN, we hear no sound.

                    MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Remember what I said about liars?  Liars
          will be punished.

     INT. CLOSET - CONTINUOUS

     Catherine hears the child SCREAM.  But the scream comes from
     behind and she spins around.

     INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - LIVING ROOM

     Young Stargher is forced to sit on the lap of an ugly MIDDLE
     AGED WOMAN barely wearing a man's robe.  On a nearby table
     are whisky, tumblers, and an ashtray filled with butts.

                    WOMAN
          I got you a present, cutie-pie.

     She gives him a TOY DOLL.  Drunk, she hugs and kisses him. 
     Embarrassed, the boy tries to squirm away.

                    WOMAN (CONT'D)
          Oh no.  You're not going anywhere.

     Martin enters and sneers at the boy.

                    MARTIN
          Go back to bed, worm.

                    WOMAN
          It's okay, we was just.

                    MARTIN
          Shut up, cunt.

     The woman cowers, familiar with his violent moods.  The boy
     hurries to his room, but Martin grabs him by the collar.

                    MARTIN (CONT'D)
          What is that?

     He pulls the doll from the child's hands, turns to the woman,
     and SMACKS her across the face with it, gashing her cheek.

                    MARTIN (CONT'D)
          You give him nothing.  Whore.  Are you
          his mother?  ARE YOU?

     Terrified, she shakes her head "no."  Martin sees Young
     Stargher quietly crawling away, hoping to escape. 
     Martin lifts the boy off the floor with one hand and holds
     him in front of the woman.

                    MARTIN (CONT'D)
          You see that?  SEE IT?  You slithered
          out one of them.  But where is she now,
          Carl?  As far from you as she could get,
          that's where.
               (shoves him at the woman)
          You want a mommy?  Is that what you
          want?

     The poor boy trembles with fear.  And Martin notices a puddle
     of urine on the floor.  He drops the boy and laughs.

                    MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Little worm pissed his pants.

     Humiliated, Carl covers himself and hides in a corner. 
     Martin and the woman LAUGH AND LAUGH, delighting in the boy's
     humiliation.

     INT. CLOSET

     Feeling the boy's shame, Catherine turns and finds a FADED
     POSTCARD taped to the wall.

     INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - BEDROOM

     Martin has discovered his son's secret hiding place - a
     camouflaged corner of the attic.  Arranged in deliberate,
     artistic fashion are scavenged DOLLS.  Heads, limbs and
     torsos held together with twine, tape and wire.  Some wrapped
     in filthy plastic.  Faded photographs (including one of his
     MOTHER), mementos, and most disturbingly, the feathers and
     bones of dead birds, insect carcasses, and dissected,
     desiccated mice.  There's something peculiarly beautiful
     here, but Martin doesn't see it.  Not at all.

                    MARTIN
          Only girls play with dolls...

     He turns and we see Carl is bound to a wooden support beam, a
     piece of tape covering his mouth.  The boy is stripped to the
     waste, barely conscious, face streaked with tears and sweat.

                    MARTIN (CONT'D)
          What kind of thing are you?

     INT. CLOSET

     A WEIRD NOISE snaps Catherine back to "reality."  She turns
     just as a door opens behind her.  Responding to the
     "invitation," she moves through it.

     INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - BATHROOM

     The adult Carl Stargher sits at the edge of the tub, his back
     to us, smoking a cigarette.  A white German Shepherd PUPPY
     clicks across the tile floor and YIPS at Catherine.  She
     again hears the WEIRD NOISE.  A STAINLESS STEEL BOWL wobbles
     as Stargher's bloody rubber-gloved hands fill it with
     something.  Stargher knows she's there and isn't surprised by
     her presence, but he's not sure what to make of her.  What to
     do with her.  He rises and walks past her to the sink.  He
     pulls off the gloves and washes his hands, glancing at her in
     the mirror.

     Catherine cannot resist looking in the tub.  She sees a dead
     girl, her torso sliced open.  Disgusted and mortified, she
     pulls back.

                    STARGHER (O.S.)
          She was the first...

     She turns, and Stargher is no longer at the sink.

                    STARGHER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Didn't know what I was doing...

     She turns, where's this voice coming from?!  She steps back.

                    STARGHER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Be careful...

     The bumps into the stainless steel bowl and it topples to the
     floor, spilling its contents of human organs.  Wobble-wobble
     wobble.  The bowl makes its now-familiar noise.

                    STARGHER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          What did you do now?  You make a mess?

     And she can see him coming out of the shadows.  Catherine
     backs into a corner, fearing what will come.

                    STARGHER (CONT'D)
          I hate a mess.

     Stargher steps into a pool of light, shooshes the puppy into
     the hall, shuts the bathroom door, and looks right at
     Catherine.

                    STARGHER (CONT'D)
          Why are you here?

     God almighty, what does she say?  What does she tell him?!

                    STARGHER (CONT'D)
          Don't lie, now...

     SCRITCH-SCRITCH-SCRITCH.  The puppy scratches at the door and
     whimpers, but Stargher's not about to let him back in. 
     Moving slowly, carefully, he approaches Catherine.

                    STARGHER (CONT'D)
          Liars will be punished.  

     Catherine makes a break for the door.  "Playfully," Stargher
     makes a half-hearted attempt to block her, but she evades him
     and reaches for the knob.  But the door's not there.  SCRITCH
     SCRITCH-SCRITCH.  She can still hear the dog, but there's no
     damn door.  She turns:

     No door.  No window.  The girl's body and bloody remains have
     vanished.  An OVERHEAD LIGHT flickers on, giving the room the
     look and feel of the cell.

                    STARGHER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Where do you think you're going?

     Catherine turns, back to the wall, calm and intimidating,
     Stargher stands in the center regarding her with great
     curiosity.  Catherine's ready to press the sensor.

                    STARGHER (CONT'D)
          Don't do that.

     She hesitates.

                    STARGHER (CONT'D)
          If you go away, you'll never find her.

     How did he know?

                    STARGHER (CONT'D)
          If you never find her, she dies.  Like
          the rest.

     Catherine stops and listens.  She can't leave now.  The path
     to Julia has appeared.

                    STARGHER (CONT'D)
          I mean, that's why you're here, right? 
          Why you came to my happy little home?

     He reaches for her and she flinches.  Expecting such
     behavior, Stargher grins.

                    STARGHER (CONT'D)
          You're pretty.  A pretty, pretty thing.

     Catherine cannot show her fear, not now.  She composes
     herself and approaches him.

                    CATHERINE
          I want to help you, Carl.

     His grin broadens to a smile and he almost laughs.

                    STARGHER
          Help me?  That's good.  That's a good
          one.
               (malevolent)
          Liar.  Whore.  Cunt.

     Catherine stands her ground.

                    CATHERINE
          You sound like your father.

     He gets close to her face and sneers.

                    STARGHER
          I am not like him.

     Stargher retreats into the shadows, but Catherine persists.

                    CATHERINE
          Then help me.  Where is Julia Hickson?

                    STARGHER
          Why?

                    CATHERINE
          Maybe, because you want to.

                    STARGHER
          Is that right?  You think you know me?
               
               
               INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY - DAY

     Henry sees a rapid rise in Catherine's warning meter.

                    HENRY
          Miriam...

     INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - BATHROOM

     A wave of fear, of impending doom, overtakes Catherine.

                    STARGHER (O.S.)
          You wanna know who I am?  You stupid
          bitch!

     And when he emerges from shadow, Stargher is STARGHER KING.

                    STARGHER KING
          Now shud you mouth, priddy thing, or me
          god slice you from the kunt to the tits.

     Catherine moves to touch the sensor in her hand.  He GRABS,
     LIFTS and SLAMS her onto the floor, the back of her head
     HITTING HARD.  Her vision blurs.  Ears are ringing.

                    STARGHER KING (CONT'D)
          Me god want you stay.

     Stargher King straddles Catherine and pins her arms behind
     her back.  She's unable to touch the sensor.  With the tip of
     the TOOL he traces a line from her pelvis up the center of
     her suit.

                    STARGHER KING (CONT'D)
          Me god mek you beaudiful...

     He shoves the tool through her neck and presses the trigger.  
     A COLLAR CLAMPS SHUT around Catherine's neck and...

     She blacks out.

     INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY

     A SENSOR ALARM SOUNDS on the computer.  Henry and Miriam
     express shock at the sight of the monitor peaking in the red
     and move to the "map" of Catherine's mind.  As it becomes
     "cool," Stargher's becomes "hot."

                    MIRIAM
          Son of a bitch!

     IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, VALENTINE BARKS!  Startling everyone. 
     The dog GROWLS and backs away.  As if he senses something
     horribly wrong within his master.

     IN THE CONTROL ROOM, Novak questions the scientists.

                    NOVAK
          When we got here, you just topped and
          pulled her out.

                    MIRIAM
          That was with Edward.  She's accustomed
          to his world.  Stargher's mind is
          unfamiliar territory.  She's "lost."
               (looks at the third suit)
          Someone has to go in. 
          Remind her what's really happening.  And
          get her out.  Until then, she's at his
          mercy.

     Mercy.  Novak's mind reels.

                    NOVAK
          Into Stargher.  Inside...

                    MIRIAM
          Yes.

     Novak knows who that person will be.

     INT. CELL - DAY

     Fueling herself with candy and juice, Julia examines the cell
     for a way out, but finds tight seals everywhere.  THE SHOWER
     ERUPTS WITH WATER!   She counts until thirty, it stops. 
     Shivering, Julia stars at the drain as the water spirals
     down.

                    JULIA
               (trying to remember the words)
          Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed
          be thy name.  Thy kingdom come, thy will
          be done.

     ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLASS, we watch her through one-way
     glass from the video camera's point-of-view.  She looks right
     at "us," in the mirror, saddened by the dark circles under
     her bloodshot eyes.

                    JULIA (CONT'D)
          ...on Earth as it is in Heaven.

     We drift to the right and see the l.e.d. counters CLICKING
     AWAY.  01:44:54, 01:44:53, 01:44:52... Less than TWO HOURS to
     live and she has no idea.

     INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY

     IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Novak lies in a hastily-rigged THIRD
     APPARATUS/SUSPENSION DEVICE.  Miriam connects him to the IV
     cylinder and tubes.

                    MIRIAM
          I have done this, you know.  Been
          inside.

                    NOVAK
          No.

     Miriam nods, knowing he won't accept an opposing argument.

                    MIRIAM
               (instructs him)
          Deep breaths.

     IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM, Henry adjusts monitors showing
     Novak's vital signs.

                    HENRY
          Pulse is rapid, pressure's a little
          high...

     IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Miriam asks:

                    MIRIAM
          Nervous?

                    NOVAK
          Absolutely.

     She loads a MICROCHIP SENSOR into a high-pressure injection
     gun and IMPLANTS it in NOVAK's HAND.  He winces from the
     brief pain as she loads the chemical cartridges.

                    MIRIAM
          I have to ask you some things... Are you
          taking any prescription drugs?

                    NOVAK
          Prevacid.  For my stomach.

                    MIRIAM
          Any psychiatric medication?

                    NOVAK
          No.  

                    MIRIAM
          What about narcotics?

                    NOVAK
          No.

                    MIRIAM
          I know your partner's here, but it's
          very important that you're honest.

                    NOVAK
          I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.

                    MIRIAM
          I doubt that.

     Henry checks the "maps,"  Catherine's vitals and reports.

                    HENRY
          We should hurry.

     Miriam walks Novak through what's about to happen.

                    MIRIAM
          The first five minutes will be
          disorienting.  Give yourself time.  Let
          the drugs do the work.  If you can see,
          smell, feel, hear, taste things - you're
          on the right track.  Once you've
          acclimated, try to get a feeling for
          Catherine.  Instinct plays a huge role
          in this.  Trust it.

     She gives him a supportive touch on the shoulder, exits and
     shuts the door.  IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM, Miriam continues
     via intercom.

                    MIRIAM (CONT'D)
          You can control how you see yourself -
          clothes, shoes, that kind of thing - but
          the rest of it is up to him.  Use only
          what he provides.  Don't try to change
          anything.  Or introduce something of
          your own.  It'll only upset him.

     IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Novak flexes his fingers and sees the
     little bump beneath his flesh.

                    HENRY (O.S.)
          Agent Novak?  Press the sensor.

     Novak does and the red light comes on.  As Novak is LIFTED,
     he looks at Catherine, then Stargher.  Valentine YIPS and
     settles beneath Novak.  The suspension device clicks into
     place and the MASK descends.

                    MIRIAM (O.S.)
          No matter what happens, Peter, remember
          one thing: It's not real.

     Novak's eyes fix on the clear liquid contained in the IV-like
     cylinder.  A liquid cloud of his blood grows within. 
     Preparing the mixture for injection.

     The viscosity of the fluid starts to thicken and the CAMERA
     MOVES INTO THE MIXTURE.  As blood and chemical swirls take
     shape, we MOVE FAST.  Deeper into the fluid at a molecular
     level.  We feel like we're SOARING over some kind of liquid
     landscape.

     NOVAK HYPERVENTILATES.  He's having difficulty making the 98
     transition.

     Flying faster, faster, faster.  Through an entire universe.

     Novak is in the procedure room.  Alone.  His face contorted
     as if feeling the effects of tremendous G-FORCE.

     ENTRANCE THREE

     INT. STARGHER'S WORLD

     CLOUDS hover above a dark, gloomy landscape dotted with
     hills.  THREE IDENTICAL WOMEN sit on black earth, their
     bodies positioned in a uniform pattern.  PULL BACK TO REVEAL
     NOVAK at their feet, in a kneeling fetal position, face down
     in the gritty soil, a piece of cloth draped over his head. 
     With difficulty, practically inhaling black grit, Novak
     breathes deeply and rises to his knees.  His hand moves to
     his face and he's briefly astounded by the texture of the
     gravel, the sharpness of it against his face.  Removing the
     shroud-like cloth, he looks at the soil, smells it, tastes
     it.

                    MOTHER ONE (O.S.)
          Have you seen him?

     Novak finds the first of the three - VISIONS OF STARGHER'S
     MOTHER - addressing him.  She, like the other two, speaks in
     a ghostly monotone, nearly devoid of emotion.

                    MOTHER ONE (CONT'D)
          My boy, my little one.  His father took
          him from me.  Have you seen him?

     As she continues, almost mantra-like, WOMAN TWO BEGINS:

                    MOTHER TWO
               (similar monotone)
          My child is an abomination.  He is
          damned.  He has no soul.

     The women's repetitive "monologues" overlap.  Aurual layers
     now added by THREE.

                    MOTHER THREE
          Me god me boy.  Me god good son.

     Novak takes a moment to absorb his surroundings.  The sights,
     sounds and feel of the place.  Like being within a dream.  As
     he backs away from the odd quartet, SHIMMERING LIGHT dances
     across his face.  Shading his eyes.  Novak searches for the
     source.

     Opposite him, across the valley, is a SHEER ROCK WALL.  A
     massive cliff face pockmarked with rough "windows."  Like a
     star, the LIGHT sparkles inside one of them, a fragment of
     MIRROR reflecting a beam away from Novak's face to a PATH
     cutting across the valley floor to the base of the wall.

     The light guiding him, Novak follows the path and starts to
     CLIMB, finding stairs or ladders, passing deep, seemingly
     infinite passages.  Like tombs, or the "drawers" of a
     mausoleum.  Deep within one of them, THE LIGHT FLICKERS. 
     Fades.  And Novak crawls into darkness.

     INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - THE DEN

     Novak emerges in a cavernous room dripping with decadence. 
     The place reeks of sex, pain, lust, and cruelty.  As he moves
     deeper into the chamber, Novak sees YOUNG STARGHER perched
     atop some kind of pedestal, crouching, fingering his mirror
     LOCKET, bouncing sparkles of light into the dark corners of
     the room

     The FLICKERING LIGHT pinpoints a FIGURE emerging from the
     darkness.  It is Catherine.  Altered to an image of
     Stargher's victims.  Her skin, face, clothing, eyes, are just
     like the Victims'.  It's a shocking, strange image, made even
     more disturbing by the look of pleasure on her face.  Novak
     is staggered by the sight.  His vision and hearing become
     affected by blurred vision, sharp sounds - then focus to
     clarity as he reminds himself...

                    NOVAK
          Not real...

     Like an ethereal queen of the damned, she strides toward him,
     narrowing her eyes.

                    NOVAK (CONT'D)
          Catherine.

     She exhibits no recognition of her name.  Catherine
     seductively moves closer to Novak, their bodies almost
     touching, her hands caressing his hair, lips, neck...

                    NOVAK (CONT'D)
          Jesus.  Catherine.  Listen to me...

     She presses her finger to his lips and forces him down, onto
     the floor, his back to the pedestal.  Catherine straddles
     Novak, and when he tries to stand, she holds him down,
     forcing him to stay.

                    NOVAK (CONT'D)
          LISTEN TO ME!

     She steals a glance over his shoulder and glimpses a MALE
     FIGURE coming toward them, coming into the light.  Novak is
     utterly unaware of what's happening.  Catherine is keeping
     him occupied.  Waiting for the arrival of...

     STARGHER KING

     Catherine LAUGHS.  Novak catches only a fleeting glimpse of
     the monster before Stargher King GRABS him by the throat and
     SMASHES his head against a pedestal.

     BLACKOUT.

     INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - THE DEN

     Eyelids rise and flutter.  Novak becomes conscious.  And
     instantly realizes what's happened.

     He lies on the pedestal, face up, spread-eagle, his wrists
     and ankles bound to the cold stone surface with leathery
     cords.  Standing over him, in a pool of light, is Stargher
     King.  Wearing what could be seen as CEREMONIAL GARB, a
     silent, solemn Stargher King prepares himself for execution
     of a ritual by polishing and arranging an assortment of
     shiny, sharp, macabre TOOLS.

     Novak shuts his eyes and silently tells himself, Not real. 
     He opens them, breathes deeply and focuses on Catherine.

                    NOVAK
          You're Catherine Young.  You majored in
          Psych at UC San Diego.  You work for
          Sunerset Industries.

     Stargher King's fingers pass over an array of horrific
     instruments - the throat piercer/collar mechanism, a cleaver
     knife, a misshapen hammer, a long slender needle...

                    NOVAK (CONT'D)
          Your grandmother raised you after your
          parents died in a car crash...

     Stargher King lifts the blade-like NEEDLE.  So far, Catherine
     looks at Novak like he's speaking gibberish.

                    NOVAK (CONT'D)
          When you were twenty-one, you were
          arrested for possession and got off with
          community service.

     Stargher King SLICES through Novak's clothes, exposing the
     flesh of his abdomen.

                    NOVAK (CONT'D)
               (reminding himself)
          Not real, Pete...This is not real...
               (urgency)
          You had to work at a center for abused
          kids for three months.  You stayed on
          two years for no pay.  You give half
          your fucking salary to the nursing home
          your grandmother stays at...

     Stargher King grabs his throat and traces the blade down the
     center of Novak's torso.  Novak struggles and pleads with
     Catherine.

                    NOVAK (CONT'D)
          I know this because I work for the FBI. 
          Peter Novak, remember?!?!
               (a desperate request)
          Remember.  You are Cath-

     Stargher King cuts his flesh and INSERTS the needle into his
     stomach.  NOVAK SCREAMS!  This fucking hurts!

                    NOVAK (CONT'D)
          Help me!!!

     Stargher King wiggles the needle, pulls it out, and digs his
     finger into the wound.  NOVAK CRIES IN PAIN.

                    NOVAK (CONT'D)
               (tears forming, horrified)
          Fucking FEELS real!

     The intensity of Novak's cries hit Catherine like a
     thunderbolt.  There's a glimmer of life, of recognition in
     her eyes.

                    STARGHER KING
               (finally speaking)
          Me god gut you like a dear.

     Although we don't see it, we HEAR something awful.  Like
     Stargher King fishing around inside the wound.  A pale,
     sweating Novak tries to stay conscious.  He will not go into
     shock...

                    NOVAK
          Not real.  Not real.  Not real.

     A FEMALE HAND grabs the tool from the tray.

                    STARGHER KING
               (mimicking Novak, laughing)
          Nod reel, nod reel, nod reel...

     STARGHER KING IS SLAMMED FROM BEHIND!  CATHERINE RAMS THE
     THING THROUGH HIS THROAT!   As Stargher King stumbles away
     gagging, blood pouring form his neck, we see that she has
     returned to normal.  The "bride" persona is gone.  As
     Stargher King emits animalistic growls, Catherine turns and
     sees an intact Novak standing next to her.  As if nothing had
     happened.

     Catherine and Novak RUN out of the den, into the tunnel from
     which Novak gained access.  He stops, ready to press the
     sensor, when a FLICKER OF LIGHT dances across Catherine's
     face.

                    CATHERINE
          Wait...

                    NOVAK
          Like hell "wait."

     But she won't listen and he's forced to play catch up as she
     moves further from the den toward the cliff face.  The
     FLICKER OF LIGHT shines on the entrance to a specific TUNNEL.

                    CATHERINE
          He wants us to follow.  The little
          boy...

                    NOVAK
          Little boy?!  That's him!

                    CATHERINE
          He brought you to me, didn't he?  If you
          want Julia to live, trust me.  Trust
          him.

     INT. TUNNEL/CUBBYHOLE

     On her hands and knees, she enters the TUNNEL, not waiting
     for him to respond.  She knows what he'll do... Catherine and
     Novak crawl through the dark, grimy claustrophobic space,
     playing with his mirror locket.

                    CATHERINE
          Carl...

     He so desperately wants her affection, but fear prevents him
     from reaching out to her.

                    CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          This is Peter.

     Scared, he shakes his head "no."

                    CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          Don't be scared.  You're my friend and I
          would never hurt you.

     She extends her hand.  Oh-so-hesitantly he takes it.

                    CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          Will you take us to her?  To Julia?

     Shyly, hesitantly, he nods.  She smiles gratefully and
     affectionately touches the boy's face.  Clasping her hand,
     Young Stargher leads Catherine and Novak into utter darkness.

     INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - THE IDEALIZED CELL

     More stylized than the actual cell, it's bigger and ornately
     decorated, with the atmosphere of a church.  Individual
     IMAGES hang like SHRINES, each showing Julia Hickson from
     different angles.

     Central to the room is a WINDOW INTO THE CELL ITSELF.  Where
     we find a beautiful, mermaid-like JULIA HICKSON floating in
     water.  Peaceful, joyous.

     IN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM, we find Novak and Catherine, she
     holding the hand of Young Stargher, he stunned at the sight
     of Julia.  The child looks at Catherine with beatific, sad
     eyes, regarding her as one would a saviour.

                    NOVAK
          Where the hell are we?

                    CATHERINE
          Carl, do you know?  Like on a map...

     He shakes his head and buries his face in her shoulder.

                    CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          It's okay, it's okay.  You helped so
          much already.  I'm proud of you.

     As a frustrated Novak searches for anything identifying,
     Catherine comforts the boy and looks deeply into his sad,
     haunted eyes.

                    CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          Carl, I think I can help you.  Would you
          like that?  Even if Peter can't find
          Julia, I want to help you.

     The boy leans against her and she caresses his face.

                    CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          I promise.

     Novak finds himself standing in front of the idealized cell. 
     Mounted beneath the glass is a shiny, perfect metal plaque
     reading CARVER INDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT, with a logo.  Novak
     recognizes it from the hoist in Stargher's basement.

                    NOVAK
          Let's go.

     He pulls her to her feet.  Feeling betrayed and rejected, the
     child breaks away from her.  THE ROAR OF STARGHER KING shakes
     the cell.  Terrified, the boy searches for a place to hide.

                    CATHERINE
          CARL!

     Novak feels what's coming.

                    NOVAK
          COME ON!

                    CATHERINE
          I can't leave him!

     STARGHER KING APPEARS!  His throat wounded, bloody mess, he
     descends out of dark nothingness, HOWLING with rage.  He
     reaches for Catherine, but Young Stargher runs in front of
     her.  

     STARGHER KING CLAMPS HIS MASSIVE ARMS AROUND THE CHILD! 
     Little Carl opens his mouth in a silent scream... Catherine's
     arms reach out to him, but Novak clasps her hand and presses. 
     And she is haunted by the sight of a frightened child in the
     arms of a monster...

     INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY

     Henry notices significant activity on the monitors.

                    HENRY
          They're back.

     Everything happens fast.  He and Miriam frantically cease the
     procedure. 
     Novak and Catherine are lowered and Novak startles them by
     quickly regaining consciousness.  Miriam attempts to inject
     him with stabilizing drugs, but he's already trying to tear
     himself out of the apparatus.

                    NOVAK
          Get me out!

     Miriam MOVES into the PROCEDURE ROOM.

                    NOVAK (CONT'D)
          GET ME OUT!

     Miriam tries to follow protocol, but Novak is moving like a
     fish caught in a net, ripping and tearing his way out of the
     apparatus and suit.  He gets to his feet, but soon falls to
     his knees, dizzy and disoriented.

                    MIRIAM
          Don't move!

     Novak is not listening.  Fighting off any after-effects- both
     physical and mental - he moves for the door.

                    MIRIAM (CONT'D)
          Agent Novak!

     Catherine is coming back and Miriam moves to her.  Novak
     pauses just for a moment.

                    NOVAK
          Is she alright?

                    MIRIAM
          Yes.  But you're going to sit down right
          now.  I have to...

     Novak is already gone.

     INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - CONFERENCE ROOM

     Novak speed-dials a number on speaker-phone, hurriedly
     dresses, and locates a photograph of Stargher's basement. 
     When he hears someone pick up the line, he barks:

                    NOVAK
          This is Novak, who've I got?

     A confused Ramsey enters and listens.

     INT. STARGHER HOUSE - BASEMENT

     A team of FBI AGENTS is meticulously going through every inch
     of Stargher's house. 
     Crisscrossed wooden beams have been laid across the pit
     allowing forensics experts to search without disturbing
     anything.  On the other end of the direct line is COLE...

                    COLE
          Agent Cole.

     (INTERCUT WITH NOVAK AND RAMSEY)

                    NOVAK
          I need you to find something in the
          basement...

                    COLE
          Already there.

                    NOVAK
          That hoist, with the winch...

     WE FOLLOW Cole as he moves to the machine.

                    NOVAK (CONT'D)
          There's some kind of plaque, a metal
          plate, with a logo.  On the base.

     Cole locates it.

                    COLE
               (reading)
          Carver Industrial Equipment.

     INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - CONFERENCE ROOM

     Novak instructs him...

                    NOVAK
          Find out the history of that machine. 
          Who bought it, used it, sold it.  And
          check Stargher's pay stubs.  I want to
          know every contractor he worked for. 
          I'm calling you from the chopper in ten
          minutes.

     Dizziness and disorientation again hit Novak.  Pale and
     sweating, he winces as his stomach agonizingly cramps.

                    RAMSEY
          Jesus Christ, man, you look like hell.

                    NOVAK
          Considering where I've been...

     Fighting the pain, he gathers together MAPS, slips on his
     shoes and grabs gun and holster.  Ramsey is apoplectic.

                    RAMSEY
          Whoa-whoa-whoa.  Mind telling me what
          the fuck is happening?

      Novak points to the photo of Stargher's basement,
     specifically the hoist.

                    RAMSEY (CONT'D)
          You're bettin' the farm on something you
          saw after they pumped you full of god
          knows-what kind of shit?

                    NOVAK
          I saw her.  Julia.  Alive.  I saw
          everything.

                    RAMSEY
          You might've seen Jimmy Hoffa dancing
          with Timothy Leary.  I don't care.

     Novak is not stopping...

     INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY

     IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Miriam shines the penlight into
     Catherine's eyes.

                    CATHERINE
          ...a pocketful of rye.

                    MIRIAM
          Four and twenty blackbirds...

                    CATHERINE
          Baked in a pie.

     AT THE CONSOLE, on a security monitor, Henry can see Novak
     and Ramsey exiting down the corridor.

                    HENRY
          The FBI has left the building.

     IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Miriam appears concerned.

                    MIRIAM
          Damn him.

                    CATHERINE
          What's wrong?

                    MIRIAM
          Agent Novak.  I didn't get a chance to
          clear him.

     Catherine encourages her.

                    CATHERINE
          Go.  I'm fine.  Go.

     As Miriam hurries to catch Novak, she tells Henry.

                    MIRIAM
          Keep an eye on her.

     He nods, but isn't really paying attention.  Catherine turns
     to Stargher's motionless form, still suspended, still
     connected to the machinery.

     INT. THE CELL - DAY

                    JULIA
          Do something, Julia.

     She looks around the room and runs her hands along the walls,
     the tile, looking for a weak spot.  She focuses on the
     CEILING PANEL and although it's painful because of swollen
     fingers, removes her ENGAGEMENT RING.

     EXT. CAMPBELL CENTER

     A ready-and-waiting HELICOPTER is on the pad.  Novak races
     out of the Center, Ramsey right behind him, SHOUTING at each
     other in order to hear above the chopper noise.

                    RAMSEY
          Pete, listen to me.  What did you really
          learn in there?  Anything new?  You
          really think Stargher gave you a save
          the-day clue?  What if this is all some
          kind of trick your head is playing on
          you?

     He won't consider that.  Novak climbs into the helicopter and
     buckles himself in.  He looks to Ramsey - you coming? -
     Ramsey pats the side of the chopper and signals for the pilot
     to take off.

     INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY

     Henry analyzes voluminous print-outs from the last procedure. 
     Although his eyes are on the data, he converses with
     Catherine in the PROCEDURE ROOM via intercom.

                    HENRY
          ...there was a moment when we thought
          we'd lost Agent Novak as well.

     We see chemicals flow and computer programs initiate the
     procedure, but Henry is oblivious.

                    HENRY (CONT'D)
          His post-procedure consciousness
          recovery was remarkably quick.  Never
          saw that before.  Hey, remember that one
          time...

     He JUMPS when the door to the procedure room SEALS SHUT and
     mechanisms HUM.

                    HENRY (CONT'D)
          Catherine?

     When he looks through the window, Catherine is again
     suspended, the procedure under way.

                    HENRY (CONT'D)
          What are you doing?

     He types in a command, but nothing happens.  He tires again.
     On another keyboard, but gets no response.  When he looks at
     the "map" screens, he sees something odd.  It's a small
     change, but it makes all the difference in the world.
     
               INT. THE CELL - DAY

     Like a rock climber in a crevasse, Julia shimmies up the
     walls of the cell by bracing herself in a corner and using
     her hands and feet to push up.  The tile is slippery and each
     movement precarious.

     She uses strength and balance to reach a position just below
     the Plexiglass, the fluorescent light bathing her in an eerie
     intense glow.  She sees a gap between the glass and the wall
     and uses her ENGAGEMENT RING to dig into it, SCAPE, SCRAPE,
     SCRAPING with the diamond.

     THE SHOWER SPRAYS WATER!  Julia nearly loses her balance, but
     manages to stay pressed into the corner.  She kicks the
     shower head, sending the spray as far from her as possible,
     and continues to dig at the caulking around the light
     fixture.

     IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM, we see something unexpected.  The
     clock reads 00:00:00.  That water isn't going to stop.

     INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - EDWARD'S ROOM

     Miriam and Ramsey return to the lab to find Henry anxiously
     observing from the console.

                    HENRY
               (flustered)
          She changed the codes.

                    MIRIAM
          What's wrong?

                    HENRY
          It would take hours to re-route the
          system, and even if I did, I shouldn't.

                    RAMSEY
          What are you talking about?

     Miriam analyzes the situation and regretfully, angrily,
     worriedly realizes what's happened.

                    MIRIAM
          She's done it.  Stupid, stupid girl...

                    RAMSEY
          Done what?

                    HENRY
          Instead of going into his mind...

                    MIRIAM
          She's bringing Stargher into hers.

     ENTRANCE FOUR

     INT. CATHERINE'S WORLD

     A bright, deliriously colorful realm visually reflective of
     things we saw in Catherine's home.  Unusual trees, rock
     formations, totems, statues, and a brilliant POOL OF WATER.

     The pond ripples.  Visible through the crystal-clear water is
     YOUNG STARGHER, rising to the surface like a drowning victim
     suddenly breaking through to air.  Panicked, he scrambles to
     shore and pulls himself to land.  Although the place is
     comforting and beautiful, he's in strange territory and it
     frightens him.  Shivering, he hunches down, eyes darting this
     way and that.

                    CATHERINE (O.S.)
          You're all right, Carl.

     The boy turns toward the voice and finds CATHERINE, her hair
     waving in the wind, skin glowing, eyes bright, cutting a
     magnificent figure in clothes that make her a warrior
     goddess. 
     She opens her arms and the boy runs to her, basking in the
     comfort of her embrace.  He shivers and she holds him
     tightly.

                    CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          It's okay, honey, you're with me now. 
          You're safe here.

     She looks deeply into his eyes and reassuringly explains.

                    CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          I promised I would help you, and I
          always keep my promises.

                    YOUNG STARGHER
          Can...

     Catherine is astonished and relieve to hear him speak.  A
     sad, trembling little voice.

                    YOUNG STARGHER (CONT'D)
          Can I stay here?

     She is touched that he would ask and strokes his face.

                    CATHERINE
               (regretfully)
          Oh...no, honey, I'm sorry.  It's doesn't
          work that way.

     The boy breaks away from her, turning his back.  She gently
     takes his hand but he yanks it free.

                    CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          But what if I told you you could come
          visit?

     He slowly turns to her.

                    CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          I'll make sure it happens, Carl.  I'll
          get them to let me do it.  And maybe...
          maybe we can...

     Young Stargher's eyes open wide with silent terror.  Over his
     shoulder, she sees a SNAKE slither through the pool. 
     CENTIPEDES CRAWL over her legs and hair.  She stands and
     brushes them off.  The atmosphere grows darker and ominous.

                    YOUNG STARGHER
          He found me...

     Catherine bristles as STARGHER KING RISES FROM THE POOL like
     a human serpent.  The brilliant colors of Catherine's world
     fade to GRIM TONES.

                    YOUNG STARGHER (CONT'D)
          He always finds me.

     Stargher King SCREECHES with anger and confusion.

                    STARGHER KING
          Where thiisss att?!?!  Me god no like id
          here...

     He snarls when he sees Catherine.

                    STARGHER KING (CONT'D)
          You.  Priddy bish-hor-kund.  You big
          trubble-mekker...
               (sneers at the boy)
          And you.  You cumm home now, liddle
          cogsugger worm.  Or me god haffa punish
          you...

     Young Stargher tightens his embrace of Catherine.  She steps
     back, away from the pond, hugging the boy tightly.

                    CATHERINE
          No.!

                    STARGHER KING
          No?!??!?!?!?

     Stargher King laughs.

                    STARGHER KING (CONT'D)
          Hoo you thing you are?? Himm Muther?

     He comes close and reaches for the boy...

                    STARGHER KING (CONT'D)
          You gimme liddle worm.

     For a moment, Catherine appears frightened and intimidated. 
     Perhaps near an emotional breakdown.  But that is not the
     case.  She quietly lowers little Carl to the ground and
     whispers something in his ear.  As the boy nods, runs and
     hides, a ferocity grows within her.

                    CATHERINE
          I said no.

     Like a vengeful Valkyrie, she emits what can only be called a
     BATTLE CRY!  STARGHER ATTACKS!  Arms reaching for her. 
     Catherine BLOCKS, PUNCHES, AND KICKS.  Stargher King doubles
     over.  Catherine grabs his ears and pulls his face into her
     bent KNEE, breaking his nose.

                    CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          Welcome to my world.

     As blood flows from his nostrils, Stargher King grins...

                    STARGHER KING
          You funny.  You thing you stop me god?

     HE CHARGES.  At the right moment, Catherine sidesteps and
     SMASHES him in the ribs as he passes.  Stargher King crumples
     to the ground and she KICKS an uppercut to this chin.  Rising
     from the mud and muck, Stargher King lands a POWERFUL BLOW to
     her head, sending her flying.  He lifts the stunned Catherine
     with one hand and pulls her face to his...

                    STARGHER KING (CONT'D)
          You cum back wif me god.  You be good
          bish-hor-kund...

     Catherine looks into his soulless eyes.  Then SPITS in them
     and BITES his face!  She breaks free as he YOWLS with pain. 
     He steps toward her, but his feet don't move.  The earth
     itself appears to wrap around them and turn hard, like
     concrete.  Stargher King HOWLS with frustration.

                    CATHERINE
          My world...

     A SHIMMERING KNIFE seems to enrage from within her forearm,
     out the flesh and into her hand.

                    CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          My rules.

     She SLASHES across his chest, drawing blood.

                    YOUNG STARGHER (O.S.)
          No!

     Catherine stops.  And turns to see the distraught Young
     Stargher.

                    YOUNG STARGHER (CONT'D)
          Don't hurt him!

     She spins around and sees not Stargher King, but MARTIN.

                    YOUNG STARGHER (CONT'D)
          He didn't mean it.  I was bad.

     Disturbed by the transformation, Catherine backs away.  Her
     vision blurs, the sound distorts.  And the earth cracks
     around Stargher King's ankles.

                    YOUNG STARGHER (CONT'D)
          He teached me a lesson.  I deserved it.

     Fighting feelings of disorientation, she kneels before the
     child and rests the knife on the ground.

                    CATHERINE
          No one deserves it, Carl.  No one.

     She reaches out to him, but the child is JERKED into the air
     by Stargher King.  In one hand, the monster holds little
     Carl.  In the other - a KNIFE.  His face and chest red with
     crimson, Stargher King fixes his eyes on Catherine with a
     predator's stare.

                    STARGHER KING
          Yer world.  My knife.

     Stargher King raises the blade toward the boy's throat and -
     SNAP!  The strong arms of an adult Stargher breaks his arm at
     the elbow.  Both the knife and boy are dropped to the ground
     as Stargher King YOWLS like a stuck pig, the good arm
     cradling the other.

                    STARGHER KING (CONT'D)
          Me god hurt!  Why you do that?  Why?!

                    STARGHER
          Enough.

     Stargher King regards him with disgust.

                    STARGHER KING
          Enuff?!?!

     MARTIN STARGHER'S VOICE comes from the belly of the beast.

                    STARGHER
          I'll tell you what's enough...

     Stargher and Stargher King square off.  The boy stands
     between them with the knife at his feet.

                    CATHERINE
          Carl!

                    STARGHER KING
               (still speaking as Martin)
          Shut up cunt.
               (to the boy)
          Give it here, worm...

     the child picks up the blade and stands between them, looking
     to Catherine for guidance.

                    STARGHER KING (CONT'D)
               (as Martin)
          You want a mommy?  Is that what you
          want?

     In an almost dream-like motion, the child hands the blade to
     adult Stargher.

                    STARGHER
          Enough.

     And he DRIVES the thing into Stargher King's heart.  For a
     brief moment, Martin's face is superimposed over Stargher
     King's.  Stunned, he slumps and regards adult Stargher with
     sad, troubled eyes.

                    MARTIN
               (as Stargher King)
          Why?  What'd I do?...

     Stargher TWISTS the handle of the blade and Martin/Stargher
     King drops dead.   Dead.  Young Stargher smiles and hugs
     Catherine.

                    YOUNG STARGHER
          Time to go 'way.

                    CATHERINE
          Carl...?

     The boy runs to adult Stargher who lifts the child into his
     arms and holds him close.

                    YOUNG STARGHER
          Bye.

     She looks to adult Stargher and begins to understand.  He
     descends into the pool, the boy resting his head on his
     shoulder.

                    STARGHER KING
          Thank you, Catherine.  You did help me. 
          More than you'll ever know.

     Man and boy disappear beneath the water's surface.  Catherine
     stands and sees that Stargher King's body has vanished. 
     She walks to the shore and sees, deep underwater, Stargher
     and little Carl floating lifelessly like women in the cell. 
     And FADE FROM VIEW.

                    CATHERINE
          Goodbye Carl.

     She presses the sensor in her hand.

     INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY

     IN THE CONTROL ROOM, Miriam is shocked by what she sees on
     the monitors and looks at Stargher.

                    MIRIAM
          He's in full arrest.

     Catherine quietly returns to consciousness and is
     automatically lowered.  She pulls the mask from her face,
     rises and opens the door.  Miriam races inside and
     desperately attempts to revive Stargher.  But it's no use. 
     Angry and stunned, she demands of Catherine.

                    MIRIAM (CONT'D)
          Help me!

     But Catherine chooses not to.  She knows Carl Stargher will
     never return to the world of the living.

     INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

     The chopper roars across the sky.  As they head northeast,
     away from the urban and toward the rural, Novak gazes out the
     window, trying to stay focused, fighting any after-effects of
     the drugs.  The pilot communicates via headset.

                    PILOT
          Agent Novak?  Go ahead.

                    NOVAK

     EXT. STARGHER'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     Cole and a handful of other agents pour into waiting
     Suburbans.  (INTERCUT WITH NOVAK IN HELICOPTER).

          The hoist was manufactured by Carver

          shop in Lake Havasu, but sold to
          Lattimer's industrial Supply in 1992...

     INT. THE CELL - DAY

     The water is near the ceiling.  Kicking her legs to keep
     afloat, Julia DIGS with the ring and we see she has created a
     gap between the light fixture housing and an unused PIPE
     leading to the surface.  She pushes, but can't get anything
     to move.  The opening will get no bigger.  Julia sucks the
     last bit of oxygen and swims to the bottom of the cell. 
     Searching for something, she finds a juice box and pulls out
     the drinking straw.

     INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY

     Shaken, but oddly transcendent, Catherine watches as
     Stargher's body is wheeled out of the lab on a gurney.  She
     comforts a whimpering Valentine and tells him...

                    CATHERINE
          Everything's alright now, Valentine.  I
          promise.

     INT. HELICOPTER

     Novak scans the topography of FARMS below, listening to a new
     report.

     INT. SUBURBAN - DAY

     Cole is the passenger, on the radio to Novak, A DRIVER next
     to him, doing about a hundred down the Interstate, SIREN
     blaring.

                    COLE
          Lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named
          Bainbridge who tired to build a machine
          works out near Delano.  Bainbridge ends
          up in bankruptcy court and the state
          winds up with the land - it's just
          sitting there.

     INTERCUT WITH NOVAK

                    NOVAK
          Delano?

                    COLE
          Yep.  And guess who they hired to seal
          up the place?

                    NOVAK
          You're kidding me.

                    COLE
          I never kid.  My wife hates it.  Says
          I'm too serious.

     Novak locates Delano on the map.

                    NOVAK
          The exact location, Cole.  Give it to
          me.

     The pilot grins and pushes the copper to top speed.

     INT. THE CELL - DAY

     Julia is entirely underwater but alive.  She uses the straw
     to suck oxygen through the gap in the ceiling, but it's
     difficult to tread water and her lungs are aching.

     INT. HELICOPTER

     Novak uses binoculars to scan farmland.  He searches.  And
     there it is: The abandoned farmhouse!

                    NOVAK
          TAKE IT DOWN!

     INT. THE CELL - DAY

     Julia tries to hold herself up by pressing her arms and legs
     against the walls, but as she does, the straw slips from her
     mouth.  She reaches for it, but only succeeds in pushing it
     away from her.  It heads for the drain.  And disappears.

     EXT. ABANDONED FARM HOUSE

     The helicopter lands and Novak jumps out.  He knows this is
     the place.  He runs into the barn, but there's nothing, no
     sign of her.  The pilot looks at him with a true sense of
     loss.

     INT. THE CELL - CONTINUOUS

     As Julia desperately tires to find the straw through the tiny
     holes of the drain, we see for the first time an expression
     which tells us she's given up.  THUMP-THUMP-THUMP.  The cell
     starts to vibrate.  A repetitive noise WHUP-WHUP-WHUP - comes
     from above.  She swims to the top of the cell and POUNDS at
     the ceiling.

     EXT. ABANDONED FARM HOUSE

     Fighting exhaustion and the side effects of the drugs, Novak
     pushes on.  Think, Peter, think... His eyes find the WATER
     TANKS and he SHOUTS at the helicopter.

                    NOVAK
          Cut the engine!

     As the motor dies, Novak listens and listens.  There it is. 
     Water pipes beneath his feet.  And very faintly, a pounding. 
     He follows the sound, searching the earth.  It's clearer now,
     louder.  Novak tosses aside rusted junk and the pilot runs to
     assist him.  Together, they expose the entrance to the
     underground sanctuary.

     INT. THE CELL - OBSERVATION ROOM

     Novak drops to the floor below.  Instantly affected by the
     similarities and the differences to the idealized cell of
     Stargher's mind, he feels another wave of dizziness, but
     pushes on.

     And is hit hard by the sight of DROWNED JULIA, her motionless
     body floating past him.  HER EYES OPEN and bubbles drift from
     her nose and mouth.  Novak BANGS on the Plexiglas and calls
     to her.

                    NOVAK
          JULIA!

     The thick Plexiglass still remains, but she now can see him. 
     Novak pulls his ID BADGE and smacks it against the glass. 

                    NOVAK (CONT'D)
          MOVE ASIDE!

     He pulls his gun and takes aim.  Julia swims to the top of
     the cell and presses herself against the ceiling.  BANG-BANG
     BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG.  Novak fires a circle of shots into the
     thick plastic.  Water slowly leaks, but the damn thing is
     still solid.  He lifts the industrial VCR and RAMS it at the
     bullet-damaged section.  CRACK! CRASH!  WATER POURS FROM THE
     CELL.  Julia's body descends on the torrent of water.  Novak
     reaches inside and pulls her to safety.  He's just about to
     give her CPR when she coughs, sputters, and thirstily drinks
     in oxygen.  Holding her tightly, Novak sinks to the floor,
     the water from the cell spilling everywhere.

     EXT. ABANDONED FARM HOUSE

     Cole's Suburban leads a contingent of FBI vehicles and local
     police cars onto the property, sirens blaring.

     INT. THE CELL - DAY

     Hearing the sirens, Novak relaxes.  For the first time in god
     knows how long, he relaxes.  And holds Julia Hickson as if
     his life depended on it.

                                                   FADE OUT.

     FADE IN:

     EXT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE - DAY

     Two cars parked outside.  An old, quirky Volvo and a Land
     Rover.

     INT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE - DAY

     As a television plays THE WIZARD OF OZ, we find Catherine
     watching the movie from the couch, sitting up, drinking a cup
     of tea.  She looks rested and quite cute in gym shorts and a
     T-shirt, her CAT sleeping next to her.  IN THE KITCHEN,
     Miriam packs up her stethoscope and blood pressure monitor,
     moves into the living room as Dorothy falls asleep in a field
     of poppies...

                    MIRIAM
          I left the nutritional information on
          the fridge door.  Read it.

     Catherine nods, but she's more interested in the movie. 
     Miriam deposits prescription bottles onto a side table.

                    MIRIAM (CONT'D)
          I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...

                    CATHERINE
          I don't need them anymore...

                    MIRIAM
          I know.

     But she leaves them just the same.

                    MIRIAM (CONT'D)
          I'll come by tomorrow after work.  With
          dinner.

                    CATHERINE
          Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...

                    MIRIAM
          ...give a kiss to Edward.

                    CATHERINE
               (overlapping)
          Give a kiss to Edward.

     The women exchange smiles and Miriam exits.

     EXT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE

     As Miriam walks to her Land Rover, she sees a government
     issue Suburban park on the street and Peter Novak exit.

                    MIRIAM
          Agent Novak.

                    NOVAK
          Dr. Kent.

                    MIRIAM
          You're looking well.

                    NOVAK
          Thanks you.  Six weeks off does a body
          good.
               (conspiratorially)
          I heard she got the approval to try the
          reversal with Edward.

                    MIRIAM
          That's a secret.

                    NOVAK
          Federal Bureau of Investigation, ma'am. 
          We know all, see all...

     Novak opens the rear compartment of the Suburban and we hear
     something moving inside.

                    NOVAK (CONT'D)
          How's the patient.

                    MIRIAM
          Awaiting his arrival.

                    NOVAK
          What about the cat?

                    MIRIAM
          Completely unaware.

     Miriam's pager BEEPS and she hurries to her car.

                    MIRIAM (CONT'D)
          I've got to go.  Good luck.

     Novak smiles, waves goodbye, and reaches into the Suburban.

     INT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE

     As Dorothy and her companions confront the Wizard, there's a
     KNOCK at the screen door and Catherine sees Novak waiting.

                    NOVAK
          Ready?

     Catherine cradles her cat.

                    CATHERINE
          Ready.

     He opens the door and escorts a leashed VALENTINE into the
     living room.  Catherine's cat squirms from her arms and hides
     under the couch.

                    NOVAK
          That went well.

                    CATHERINE
          Give her a minute.
               (smiles at the dog)
          Hello, Valentine.

     Novak unleashes the albino Shepherd and he runs to Catherine,
     licking her face, wagging his tail.

                    NOVAK
          You sure about this?

                    CATHERINE
          Absolutely.
               (calling for the cat)
          Abigail...

     Valentine picks up the cat's scent and sniffs around the base
     of the sofa.

                    CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          I heard Julia and John got married.

                    NOVAK
          Yep.  Eloped.

                    CATHERINE
          Good for them.

     Valentine settles on the floor.  Slowly, Abigail's curiosity
     gets the best of her and she creeps out, sniffing the dog's
     nose.  Patient and sweet, Valentine lies still, allowing the
     cat to reach an acceptable level of comfort.

                    NOVAK
          Well look at that.

                    CATHERINE
          I told you.  You have to be optimistic. 
          Believe in them...

                    NOVAK
          So you say.

     Amazingly, Abigail brushes up against the dog and purrs.

                    CATHERINE
          He's mine?

                    NOVAK
          All yours.  My boss says it's one of the
          strangest requests the Bureau's ever
          had.

     Catherine laughs.  She likes that.

                    NOVAK (CONT'D)
          He also says that until proven
          differently, Julia Hickson was found as
          a result of good old-fashioned detective
          work.

                    CATHERINE
          It doesn't matter...

                    NOVAK
          I don't know.  I think it does.
               (genuine concern)
          You know, Catherine... If you ever want
          to talk about it.  What happened to
          Stargher.  That last time.

     It's painfully clear the thought of it still troubles her.

                    CATHERINE
          Not just yet.  Okay?

     Novak doesn't push it.  He just takes her hand and gives it a
     gentle squeeze.  The cat dashes into the kitchen and
     Valentine follows.

                    CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          They're hungry.

                    NOVAK
          I got it.

     He moves into the kitchen.  In a moment of quiet
     introspection, Catherine looks at the television screen, at
     Dorothy accidentally hitting the wicked Witch with a bucket
     of water, causing her to melt.  And she looks away, unable to
     watch, disturbed by the image.  She turns to the kitchen and
     sees Novak feeding an appreciative dog and cat.  He rises and
     returns to the living room.

                    CATHERINE
          Thank you.

                    NOVAK
          No problem.

                    CATHERINE
          No.  Thank you.

     He smiles and nods, gently resting his hand on her shoulder. 
     Catherine shuts her eyes and leans toward him, comforted by
     simple human touch...

                                    FADE TO BLACK.
