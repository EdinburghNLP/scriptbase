THE DEATH ARTIST (1995)

(REMAKE OF CORMAN'S CLASSIC "BUCKET OF BLOOD")


INT JABBERJAW - NIGHT

The cavernous CLUB is packed with a cross section of ARTISTS, POETS, 
ACTORS, MODELS, ROCKERS, GRUNGERS, PUNKS, ADDICTS, and other 
assorted characters, standing at the bar and seated at tables - 
bizarre PAINTINGS and SCULPTURES adorn the walls -

CLOSE on a BOOM BOX on a stage - the tape rolls, and soon strange 
industrial music begins to blare from the box -

MAXWELL, an eccentric - looking man with a goatee and various 
PIERCINGS on his face, stands on the stage in front of a microphone 
- an abstract PORTRAIT hangs on the wall behind him -

                    MAXWELL
          I will talk to you of art, for
          there is nothing else to talk
          about, for there is nothing
          else...life is nothing but
          homeless traveler on the RTD
          of art...

We pull back to see PATRONS sitting at tables amid various 
sculptures, paintings, and displays of questionable artistic promise 
-

                    MAXWELL
          Burn gas on the freeways, and whip your
          sour cream of circumstance...flip at
          your channels and plod at your monitors...

Soon we see WALTER PAISLEY, a meek, unassuming bus boy, work his way 
around the tables, taking empty drinks, emptying ashtrays, all the 
time listening to the performer on
stage -

                    MAXWELL
          Creation is, all else is not...
          what is not creation is meatless
          sausage, and rice cake, let it
          all crumble to feed the artist -

Walter passes a table where an upscale ART DEALER with a ponytail 
interrupts his prospective client to answer his
cellular phone -

                    MAXWELL
          The artist is, all others are not, a
          canvas is a canvas or a painting, a
          rock is a rock or a statue, a sound
          is a sound or it is music, a preacher
          is a preacher or an artist -
Walter passes ART, seated with two attractive women - he rolls 
himself a cigarette, nodding in approval to Maxwell -

                    MAXWELL
          Where are John Joe Jake Jim Jerk,
          dead dead dead, they were not born
          before they were born, they were not
          born, where are Leonardo, Mozart,
          Shakespeare, alive alive alive, they
          were born -

Walter continues to bus the room - he pauses to stop and listen to 
Maxwell - he then looks over a MAN'S shoulder - he is sketching - 
Walter observes the SKETCH -

POV It is a fairly good sketch of the room -

LEONARD, the artsy manager of the club, notices Walter pausing to 
listen -

                    MAXWELL
          Bring on the multitudes and the
          multitude of fishes - feed them
          that you will be satisfied,
          nourish the artist, stretch their
          skin upon an easel, crush their
          bones into a paste, so that he may
          mold them, let them die, and by
          their miserable death become the
          clay in his hands, that he might
          form an ashtray or an ark - that he
          might take you in his magic hands
          and wring from your marrow wonder -
          all that is comes through the eye
          of the artist -

Walter moves on - sees an attractive woman, CARLA, who opens a 
MANILA ENVELOPE and removes some HEAD SHOTS of herself -

                    MAXWELL
          The rest are blind fish, swimming
          in the cave of aloneness- swim on you
          mortal and muddling maddened souls -
          and dream, of one bright and sunny
          island - some artist will bait a hook,
          and let you bite upon it, bite hard, and
          die -

Walter looks at Carla's picture -


                    MAXWELL
          In his stomach, you will feed
          creation!

Maxwell turns off the tape, and the audience applauds -

Carla then looks up to see Walter looking at her picture - he 
awkwardly smiles at her and she smiles back -

Leonard then approaches Walter -

                    LEONARD
          Walter, what are you doing?

                    WALTER
          I was just looking at Carla's
          picture.

                    LEONARD
          Well that's not what I pay you for,
          now is it?

                    WALTER
          Well I was uh, just looking...

                    LEONARD
          Well do some looking around the room.
          I see cups, ashtrays - let's go...

Walter slinks away - Leonard gets close to Carla, very close, all 
the time admiring her head shot -

                    LEONARD
          Ah, your new head shot...
               (Beat)
          I like it, very much...

                    CARLA
          Do you have to be so cold to him?

Leonard smiles, and strokes Carla's hair -

Walter watches this, the turns and walks away -

At the entrance of the club stands LOU, a man in a designer suit, no 
tie - he scans the room as Walter passes him -

                    LOU
          How ya doin'?

                    WALTER
          Uh, hi.

Walter slinks away, and Lou looks around some more -

Art sees Lou -

Lou subtly gestures to Art and heads into the club -

Art gets up, addressing the two girls -

                    ART
          I'm out of here.

Art and Lou head toward the MEN'S ROOM -

INT MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Art and Lou check the stalls to see the room is empty -

                    ART
          Alright we're clear.

                    LOU
          Anything new?

                    ART
          Not really.  One girl who fit the
          descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette,
          didn't see much changing hands.

                    LOU
          Is the manager cooperating?

                    ART
          Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said
          he'd call us if he sees anything.
          That's about it for tonight.

                    LOU
          Alright I got you, man.  It's my
          turn for freak patrol.

                    ART
          You know it.
               (Beat)
          I'm out of here.

Art heads out, and Lou checks himself in the mirror -

INT JABBERJAW - NIGHT

Maxwell sits at a table with Carla, MAYOLIA, a skinny yet buxom 
woman, and CHARLIE, a long-haired hanger-on - Maxwell is looking at 
Carla's head shot -

                    CARLA
          So, do you like it?



                    MAXWELL
               (bored)
          It's perfectly adequate, as far
          as those type of things go...

Walter approaches, with a tray of glasses in his hand -

                    MAXWELL
               (changing subject)
          I don't think anyone gets what
          I said, their blank faces staring,
          mute, unfeeling -

                    WALTER
          I liked it very much Mr. Brock.
          I liked it very much.

                    MAXWELL
               (condescending)
          Well I'm overjoyed.

                    WALTER
          "Let them die, and by their miserable
          death become the clay in his hands,
          that he might form an ashtray or an
          ark -"

Carla looks at Walter -

                    CARLA
          That's word for word.

                    MAXWELL
          Is it?  I've forgotten.

                    MAYOLIA
          You mean you don't remember your
          own poem?

                    MAXWELL
          I refuse to say anything twice -
          repetition is death!

                    CHARLIE
          What do you mean?

                    MAXWELL
          When you repeat something, you
          are reliving a moment, wasting
          it, looking at a shed skin - I
          only want new impression, new
          sensations -


                    WALTER
          I thought you believed that life
          is a homeless traveler riding on
          the RTD of -

                    MAXWELL
               (interrupting)
          I know that - I know that! I also
          believe in burning the creative
          candle, you understand, down to
          the end - to be uncreative you
          might as well be dead...a walking
          machine, toiling in a factory!

                    WALTER
          I worked in one of them.  Back in
          Alaska.
               (smiles meekly)

The people at the table look at Walter, then laugh
cynically -

In the background, Leonard glares at Walter -

                    CARLA
          Walter, Leonard's looking at you
          again.

Walter grabs up a cup and saucer off the table, almost spilling the 
contents before heading off -

                    CHARLIE
          That guy's a class-A cracker.

                    MAXWELL
          Walter's got a clear mind.  Probably
          something will enter it, feel lonely,
          and leave again...

Everyone at the table laughs weakly -

At another table two eccentrically dressed ARTISTS, CUFF and LINK, 
talk to an upscale older couple - Cuff has a series of MATTED 
PHOTOGRAPHS in his hand -

                    OLDER MAN
          I've heard you can find some
          cutting edge pieces here if you
          keep an eye out -

                    OLDER WOMAN
          I'd like to find something for
          our den, something unusual -

                    CUFF
          Well maybe these works might
          interest you -

Cuff shows the woman the photographs - she reacts to them with 
disdain -

POV they are pictures of various ROAD KILLS - squirrels, skunks, 
possums -

                    CUFF
          It's our road kill series.  I take
          the pictures.

                    LINK
               (proudly)
          I do the research.

The woman hands back the photographs -

                    OLDER WOMAN
          Not quite what I was looking for.

                    OLDER MAN
          Yes, we're interested in something
          with some investment potential -

                    CUFF
          Hey, this is no supermarket,
          there are no aisles, it's all
          in the attitude -

Walter approaches -

                    LINK
          Yeah that's a dead soul way to
          look at it -

                    OLDER WOMAN
          Nonsense.  We have developed many
          a rapport with struggling artists -
          we're very supportive -

                    WALTER
          "All that is comes through the eye
          of the artist - the rest are blind
          fish, swimming in the cave of
          aloneness."

The four people stare at Walter -

                    OLDER WOMAN
          That's very deep, and coming from a
          bus boy too -
                    WALTER
          "Feed them that you will be satisfied -
          the artist is, all others are not -"

                    OLDER MAN
          Where have I heard that before?

                    OLDER WOMAN
          Are you a poet also?

                    WALTER
          Uh...no.  No I'm not.

                    OLDER MAN
          What do you do?

                    WALTER
          Well, uh, I'm...working, I've
          been working on something, it's
          not ready yet.

                    CUFF
          What is it, a crying clown?

                    WALTER
          Huh?!

                    LINK
          Walter must have bought himself
          some crayons.

Leonard approaches, looking exasperated -

                    CUFF
          Get out of here, man.  We're
          negotiating a deal.

                    WALTER
          I am working on something!  I'm
          going to show you soon!

                    LEONARD
          Walter!

Leonard gets close to him -

                    LEONARD
               (under his breath)
          You're starting to try my
          patience!

Walter sheepishly heads off - the two artists laugh -

The older woman looks at Leonard -
                    OLDER WOMAN
          Is he, uh?...

                    LEONARD
          About to be out of a job.

Walter returns to Maxwell's table, where Carla, Mayolia, and Charlie 
are still sitting - he gestures to some empty glasses -

                    WALTER
          Are you done with these?

                    MAXWELL
          Yes, get rid of them...

In the split second when no one is looking, Walter snatches up one 
of Carla's head shots, keeping it under his tray, as he cleans up 
the empty glasses -

                                             DISSOLVE TO
EXT JABBERJAW - NIGHT

Walter passes an alley where a group of THUGS hastily strips down a 
car parked on the street -

EXT STREET - NIGHT

Walter walks the streets alone - soon he stops and looks ahead -

There is a PARKED CAR with the windows open - A COUPLE is making out 
in the front seat -

Walter smiles meekly -

Soon the man in the car, a mean-looking character spots Walter - the 
two stop making out and the man stares at Walter -

                    MAN
          What are you looking at?  You want
          to get shot?

Walter's smile fades, and he stuffs his hands in his pockets, and 
heads down the street, alone, inadvertently bumping into some 
GARBAGE CANS -

EXT COURTYARD APARTMENTS - NIGHT

Walter unlocks a creaky iron gate covered with dead ivy -



EXT COURTYARD - NIGHT

As Walter heads in, he runs into MRS. SWICKER, the
landlady -

                    WALTER
          Oh, hello Mrs. Swicker.

                    MRS. SWICKER
          Hello Walter.  I want to tell
          you the super fixed the leaky
          pipes and sealed up that hole in
          your wall.

                    WALTER
          Oh, OK.

                    MRS. SWICKER
          Walter you look awful pale!
          What did you have to eat today?

                    WALTER
          I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.

                    MRS. SWICKER
          If you were my son...why don't you
          let me fix you a nice hot bowl of
          soup, it won't take but a minute.

                    WALTER
          Oh no, that's OK, I can fix myself
          something.  Besides, I got something
          important to do...

Walter goes to unlock his door -

                    MRS. SWICKER
          Oh by the way did you happen to
          see Frankie out here, by any
          chance?

Walter thinks for a second -

                    WALTER
          Uh, no, I didn't see him at all.

                    MRS. SWICKER
          What's got into that cat?  Well if
          you do see him, tell him I've got
          a nice fat piece of ocean-fresh
          halibut for him -

                    WALTER
          T-tell him that?

                    MRS. SWICKER
          If you see him.

                    WALTER
          OK Mrs. Swicker.

Mrs. Swicker heads off -

                    MRS. SWICKER
          Good night Walter...

                    WALTER
          Good night, Mrs. Swicker -

Walter opens his door and heads in -

INT WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT

Walter closes the door and turns on a LIGHT hanging over a kitchen 
TABLE - a CLOTH covers an object roughly the size of a bowling ball 
on the table -

He removes Carla's head shot, tucked inside his shirt, and places it 
on the table after looking at it for a beat -

Walter heads over to the STOVE, stopping to notice a freshly 
plastered area on the wall, a bag of PLASTER still on the ground -

Walter opens himself up a can of BEANS - he looks around and finds 
an old, dented metal POT, pouring the beans into the pot -

He throws the empty can in the direction of an overflowing GARBAGE 
CAN, lights the stove and puts the pot on the
burner -

Walter then takes a seat at the table - he lifts the
cloth, revealing a mound of CLAY -

A cat meows in the distance as Walter looks at Carla's picture, 
appreciating her beauty -

                    WALTER
          Now I have my muse...

Walter then turns and begins to mold the clay -

                                             DISSOLVE TO
INT WALTER'S ROOM

A half-hour later.  Walter has attempted to sculpt a bust - he looks 
at Carla's picture, then back at his sculpture -

Walter's POV it is a badly sculpted HEAD, that not only looks 
nothing like Carla but has a hard time passing for anything human -

Walter looks at it, knowing that much work is needed on his creation 
-

He grabs a blob of fresh clay from an adjacent pile and begins to 
form a nose - the cat meows again - Walter looks around -

                    WALTER
          Frankie?

Walter continues enthusiastically sculpting the blob of
clay -

                    WALTER
          A canvas is a canvas or a painting.
          A rock is a rock or a statue...a
          sound is a sound or is music...

Walter looks at the sculpture -

Walter then attaches the nose - smoothing it on -

It looks RIDICULOUS, something out of grammar school art class - 
he's having difficulty forming anything that resembles a nose -

                    WALTER
          Come on...you're supposed to be
          a nose...

The malformed face stares dumbly back at him as he fights to shape 
the nose -

The cat meows again - Walter is getting increasingly frustrated - he 
backs up to look at the head -


PAN the photograph of Carla, over to the sculpture - one of the ears 
falls off -

Walter squints at the head, failing to convince himself it's looking 
better - frustrated, Walter yanks the nose off and grabs a little 
more clay -

                    WALTER
          Why can't I make a nose!

On the stove, the beans begin to boil -

Walter shapes the clay and sticks the nose back on, his tongue 
sticking out of his mouth as he fumbles with it -

The nose has changed shape and juts perpendicularly off the head, 
resembling Pinocchio -

Walter begins to sculpt with increasing fury -

He grabs up more clay, starts mushing the face -

Soon the object begins to lose resemblance to anything close to a 
human head, or anything for that matter -

Walter stands up and backs up, looking at the sculpture - getting 
angry he begins to mush the sculpture -

                    WALTER
          No no no no -

The cat meows again, louder - Walter looks around, irritated - he 
begins to SQUASH the sculpture -

Finally losing his patience Walter kicks back the chair, grabs the 
clay head and HURLS it across the room -

The clay hits the wall with a dull THUD, stays there for a beat, 
then falls to the ground -

Walter pushes back his hair with his hand - the cat meows -

The beans begin to OVERFLOW on the stove -
Walter runs toward the stove, smacking his head on the overhead 
light -

The light swings back and forth as Walter rushes over to the pot, 
grabbing it hastily off the stove before SHRIEKING in pain and 
dropping the pot into the sink, splattering beans in all directions 
-

Walter clutches his hand in pain as the light swings, the cat 
meowing louder -

Walter begins to look around furiously -

                    WALTER
          Frankie shut up!

Walter then focuses his frustrated mind toward the direction of the 
patched up wall -

Walter gets closer -

He hears the meowing coming from inside the wall -

                    WALTER
          Frankie?

Walter puts his ear to the wall - he hears SCRATCHING
noises -

Walter turns away from the wall -

                    WALTER
          I don't believe this!
               (yelling at the wall)
          How did you get stuck in the wall!

The meowing persists -

                    WALTER
          Alright alright - calm down,
          I'll get you out -

Walter looks around, goes toward a drawer by the sink, and produces 
a long, narrow CARVING KNIFE - he heads back to the wall -

                    WALTER
          Hang tight Frankie, ol' Walter's
          gonna get you out...

Walter then feels the wall as if he does this type of thing 
professionally - when the determines the proper area of entry he 
carefully aims the knife and - WHAM! -

SCREECH!  Frankie makes a comical screech of pain which ends 
abruptly -

Walter FREEZES - his eyes wide open with panic - he stands back -

The wall is silent -

                    WALTER
          Frankie?

There is no response -

                    WALTER
          Frankie how're ya doin' in there?

There is no response -

Walter begins to BEAT the wall, until the thin material begins to 
give way -

He RIPS a big chunk of the wall off, confirming the worst -

The knife IMPALED Frankie into a wooden stud in the wall - the cat 
is no more -

Walter pulls and tugs at the knife until it is freed from the wall - 
he gingerly cradles Frankie, still impaled by the knife -

                    WALTER
          What have I done?

Walter walks over to the kitchen table -

                    WALTER
          Oh Frankie I'm so sorry...

He lowers the cat down -

                    WALTER
          Poor Mrs. Swicker...
               (Beat)
          She had a nice fat piece of
          ocean-fresh halibut for you...

Walter walks backward toward the kitchen, looking forlornly at the 
cat -

He reaches for another can of beans, but his eyes focus on the clay 
head on the floor -

Walter picks up what used to be a head and sits back down at the 
kitchen table -

He looks at Carla looking back at him from the picture - he then 
stares blankly ahead -

                    WALTER
          Repetition is death, Frankie...
                                             DISSOLVE TO

EXT LOS ANGELES - DAWN

Silhouetted buildings in the early light -

INT WALTER'S ROOM - DAWN

Still dressed, Walter tosses and turns on his bed -

                    MAXWELL(V.O.)
          Nourish the artist, stretch their
          skin upon an easel, crush their
          bones into a paste, so that he may
          mold them, let them die, and by
          their miserable death become the
          clay in his hands, that he might
                    MAXWELL (cont.)
          form an ashtray or an ark - that he
          might take you in his magic hands
          and wring from your marrow wonder -
          all that is comes through the eye
          of the artist -

Walter bolts upright, waking from his dream -

                    WALTER
               (beat, then almost
                imperceptibly)
          Where are the John Joe Jake Jim...
          Jerk...

Walter gets up out of bed - he heads toward the kitchen table -

He looks at a now stiff Frankie -

                    MAXWELL(V.O.)
          Dead...dead...dead...

Walter stares at Frankie for a beat and turns off the overhead lamp 
- he then looks up, as if getting an idea -

He looks over at the floor -

Sees the BAG OF PLASTER -

EXT STREET - DAY

Walter's feet are visible as he walks down the street - as we pan 
up, we see Walter cradling a PACKAGE wrapped in brown paper and 
string -

EXT JABBERJAW - DAY

Leonard stands very close to Carla, who is wearing tight, red velvet 
bell-bottoms - she flips through several canvases of SCRIBBLE 
PAINTINGS she has brought over -

                    CARLA
          I'm trying to find a style of
          my own.  Do you really like them?

                    LEONARD
          Oh yes...very nice...very, very
          nice...

Walter then approaches with his package -

Carla sees him - so does Leonard -

                    CARLA
          Hi Walter...

                    LEONARD
          What are you doing here so early?

                    WALTER
          Well I brought something, I wanted
          to show you.

                    LEONARD
          What is it, your laundry?

                    WALTER
          Huh?

                    CARLA
          Don't worry about him...what have
          you got?

                    WALTER
               (enthusiastically)
          A thing I made.

Walter lowers it to the ground and undoes the string - he then opens 
the paper and reveals what he brought -

It is FRANKIE, encased in plaster along with the knife -

Walter grins like a simpleton at his creation, but Carla is 
impressed -

                    CARLA
          Wow...
               (Beat)
          Wow...

Carla picks up the statue -

                    CARLA
          Leonard...look at this...

Leonard puffs on his cigarette -

                    LEONARD
          Where'd ya buy that?

                    WALTER
          I didn't buy it I made it.

Leonard takes another puff -



                    LEONARD
               (incredulous)
          You...made that?

                    WALTER
          I said I did, didn't I!

                    CARLA
          I've never seen anything like this,
          maybe Segal, but nothing with such...
          dichotomy...
               (Beat)
          It's very good, Walter -

                    WALTER
          Honest?

                    LEONARD
          Well, what's it called?

Walter looks up at Leonard -

                    WALTER
          Dead Cat!

                    LEONARD
               (Beat)
          Dead Cat?

                    WALTER
          Yeah.

                    LEONARD
          Well it sure looks dead enough.

Walter stands up -

                    WALTER
          You want to buy it, put it in the
          club?

                    LEONARD
          You want me to buy Dead Cat?
               (laughs)
          It'll scare people away.

                    CARLA
          Don't you feel it?

Leonard and Walter look at Carla -

                    LEONARD AND WALTER
               (simultaneously)
          Feel what?

                    CARLA
          Don't you feel what it's giving
          off?  It's...presence...
          come take a closer look...

Leonard gets closer -

                    CARLA
          Look at the detail, it's so alive,
          and yet...so dead...

Carla turns the statue's face toward Leonard -

                    CARLA
          Look at the expression on its face...

Walter puffs his cigarette and stares at Walter -

                    LEONARD
          Well...why did you put a knife in
          it?

                    WALTER
          I didn't mean to.

                    LEONARD
          Got carried away, huh?

Leonard inspects the statue -

                    LEONARD
          Alright, I'll tell you what.  I'll
          put it in the corner of the alcove.
          If it sells, we'll split it fifty-
          fifty.  How's that?

                    WALTER
          Sure!
               (Beat, then to Carla)
          So I guess that means I'm an
          artist after all.

                    CARLA
               (smiles politely)
          Maybe so...

                    LEONARD
          I wouldn't give up your day job.

                    WALTER
          All that is comes through the
          eye of the artist...

                    LEONARD
          Alright get a grip on yourself
          Now since you're here why don't
          you start early, the kitchen
          needs cleaning.

                    WALTER
          Sure!

Walter heads off then turns and faces Leonard and Carla -

                    WALTER
          You really like it?

                    CARLA
          Of course...it's wonderful.

                    LEONARD
          I can barely contain myself.
          Now chop chop!

Walter heads into the back -

INT JABBERJAW - NIGHT

The scene is happening, strange music plays in the background -

Art walks into the club - Walter passes him -


                    WALTER
          Did you see my cat?

                    ART
          Why, is he lost?

                    WALTER
          No, I uh...

Walter walks away -

In the alcove sits Dead Cat -  a young man wearing a beret and 
leather jacket inspects the work - he seems zonked out on some 
chemical - Walter approaches him -

                    WALTER
          You like my cat?

                    YOUNG MAN
          Yeah...it's like out there,
          you understand what I'm saying?


                    WALTER
          Sure.  You want to buy it?

                    YOUNG MAN
          No man, I don't have the funds
          to be buying various pieces of
          artwork, you understand what I'm
          saying?

Leonard approaches -

                    WALTER
          Sure.

The young man heads off - Walter faces Leonard -

                    WALTER
          People seem to like my cat.

                    LEONARD
          Enough already about it - get to
          work!

Walter heads off  - Leonard lights a cigarette and looks at the 
sculpture -

Walter busses a table -

                    CHARLIE(O.S.)
          Hey Walter, come here!

Walter heads over to a table - seated are Maxwell, Carla, Charlie, 
and another attractive blonde woman - Maxwell appears clearly 
intoxicated -

                    CHARLIE
          Congrats, Walter.

                    CARLA
          Walter everyone's talking about
          it.

Maxwell turns and focuses on Walter -

                    MAXWELL
          I saw your...cat.

                    WALTER
          Did you like it Mister Brock?

                    MAXWELL
          Call me...Maxwell.


                    CHARLIE
          How'd ya do it Walter?

                    WALTER
          Oh, I just got some plaster,
          and fixed it up.

                    CHARLIE
          Papier mache?

                    WALTER
          Uh, no.  Plaster.

Charlie laughs - Maxwell stares at Walter, then staggers to his feet 
- looks at the room -

                    MAXWELL
          Attention everyone!  Everybody!

Some people pay attention -

                    MAXWELL
               (drunkenly)
          As you pass through these yellow
          portals I am sure you noticed
          on your right a small plaster
          figure, and assumed this
          transfixed effigy to be the work
          of a master sculptor.  Indeed,
          so it is.  And that bright, new
          creator is in our midst.  He's
          none other than Walter Paisley,
          our very own bus boy, whose
          undiscovered hands of genius have
          been carrying away your empty
          cups of frustration!

People look at Walter, who sheepishly accepts the praise -

                    MAXWELL
          Remember him.  His is the silent
          voice of creation.  Within the
          dark rich soil of humility, he
          blossoms as the hope of our
          nearly sterile times.

Charlie and Carla clap -

                    MAXWELL
               (to Walter)
          Bring me a gimlet.

Maxwell sits back down -

Walter passes a table where Cuff, Link and Mayolia are sitting -

Cuff stops him -

                    CUFF
          Hey congrats on the cat Walter.
          I wonder where you got the idea
          of dead animals.

                    WALTER
          Huh ?

                    LINK
          Yeah, can you say plagiarism?

                    CUFF
          Not only that, he copied us!

                    MAYOLIA
          Oh nonsense!  Your works hit the
          viewer over the head.  They're
          so...obvious.

Mayolia then looks up at Walter -

                    MAYOLIA
          I get it Walter.  I get it.

                    WALTER
          What do you get?

                    MAYOLIA
          Your work, the layers of
          irony.

Just then several people approach Walter and begin asking him 
questions -

Art watches the commotion -

Leonard also watches the commotion with a completely dumbfounded 
expression on his face -

Art dealers talk to Walter, as well as artists -

Just then Lou walks in, stands next to Art -

                    LOU
          What the hell's going on?

                    ART
          Everyone wants to meet the
          bus boy.

                    LOU
          What did he do?

                    ART
          He made a cat.

Lou looks at Art, who returns the stare -

                    ART
          Outta plaster.

Lou walks in -

                    LOU
          See you later -

                    ART
          Righto.

Art leaves - Leonard looks at Walter -

Walter uncomfortably enjoys the attention -

Just then the old couple chimes in - the older man looks around -

                    OLDER MAN
          Where's my mocha latte double
          grande!

Leonard drops his cigarette and crushes it with his foot -
He heads over to Walter and escorts him away from the
people - Walter accepts someone's BUSINESS CARD -

Leonard takes him aside -

                    WALTER
          Did you hear that Mr. De Santis?
          Everyone's really crazy about
          Dead Cat.

                    LEONARD
          Yes they are, aren't they?  Look,
          why don't you take the rest of the
          night off, you look tired.

                    WALTER
          Well I don't know -





                    LEONARD
          No, it's Ok...you came in early.
               (Beat)
          Besides, you're creating an incident.
          When people are applauding they don't
          order anything.

                    WALTER
          Well...
     
                    LEONARD
          Look, go home and...work on something.
          Make another cat.

                    WALTER
          I don't have another cat!

                    LEONARD
          Well make a dog, make a parakeet!
          I'm sure you'll think of something.

                    WALTER
          A parakeet?

Leonard begins to lose his patience - he yanks the tray out of 
Walter's hand -

                    LEONARD
          Go home.

                    WALTER
          OK...good night Mr. De Santis!

                    LEONARD
          Good night Walter.
                    
                    MAYOLIA(O.S.)
          Wait - Walter!

Walter begins to head out the door but is stopped by
Mayolia - Walter turns around and faces her - she gets
close -

                    WALTER
          Hello Mayolia.

                    MAYOLIA
          Walter, you did something to me
          with your work tonight.

                    WALTER
          With Dead Cat?


                    MAYOLIA
          With Dead Cat.  Like a breath
          of fresh air.  I could just -
          babble on about it for hours.

                    WALTER
          Really?

Mayolia gives him "that" look -

                    MAYOLIA
          Yeah.  I really could.  I'm not
          just saying that.

Mayolia gets closer making her heaving cleavage more accessible to 
Walter's eyes -

                    MAYOLIA
          It's like...you've turned on.

                    WALTER
          T-turned on?

                    MAYOLIA
          A hot light bulb is burning inside
          of you.
               (Beat)
          I want to be warmed by it.

                    WALTER
          That's really nice of you
          Mayolia.

                    MAYOLIA
          Let me into your world Walter...
          let me into that white hot
          inspired world.

                    WALTER
          I can't.  I gotta go home.

Mayolia presses herself against Walter, who awkwardly
reacts -
                    MAYOLIA
          Well, I'll go home with you.

                    WALTER
          Oh no, I couldn't do that.  Mrs.
          Swicker would start asking questions.
          She's my landlady.

Art sits at a table, watching the encounter -


                    MAYOLIA(O.S.)
          Isn't there anything I can do
          for you?

Mayolia reaches out and touches Walter -

                    WALTER
          I don't think so Mayolia.

                    MAYOLIA
          I want to be part of it, I want
          to inspire you, I want to do -
          something!

                    WALTER
          You don't have to do anything!

                    MAYOLIA
               (Beat)
          Then let me give you something
          then...

Walter watches, perplexed, as Mayolia reaches into her cleavage -

Lou watches the transaction carefully -

Mayolia takes out a CAMEO NECKLACE, takes it off her neck -

                    MAYOLIA
          Maybe this will give you some
          inspiration, change your
          perception of reality...

Mayolia looks around, and hands the necklace to Walter -

                    MAYOLIA
          I want you to have it.  There's
          a little something for you in
          here...

                    WALTER
          Gee.  Thanks.

                    MAYOLIA
          Let it inspire you.  Maybe it
          will let you think of me.

She wraps Walter's hand around the necklace -

                    MAYOLIA
          If you have to go, go.

Walter backs out -
                    MAYOLIA
          Go and don't look back.

Walter leaves -

Lou waits for a beat, then gets up -

EXT JABBERJAW - NIGHT

Walter leaves the club, passing some incoming people -

When he leaves, Lou exits the club -

He heads over to the payphone and picks up the receiver, about to 
make a call -

Suddenly, he changes his mind - he hangs the receiver up, and 
decides instead to follow Walter -

INT WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT

Walter closes the door and turns on the overhead lamp -
He looks at the medallion Mayolia gave him and places it on the 
table - he then picks it up again, inspects it -

He notices the medallion has a clasp -

EXT WALTER'S WINDOW - NIGHT

Lou is outside, watching Walter -

He then checks his .45 HANDGUN and stuff it back in his shoulder 
holster under his jacket -

INT WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT

Walter notices the medallion has a clasp - he pops it open and 
notices a twisted-off corner of a PLASTIC BAG containing a white 
powder inside - he opens the bag and smells the powder, no knowing 
what it is - he dabs his finger in it and puts it on his tongue, 
GRIMACING at the taste of the substance - he puts the open medallion 
down on the kitchen table -

EXT WALTER'S WINDOW - NIGHT

Lou heads off -

INT WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT

Walter heads over to the dresser, looks at himself in the mirror-


                    WALTER
          Why yes, that is one of my pieces...
          it's one, in a series...

Walter then picks up the picture of Carla, looks at it for a beat -

                    WALTER
          And I love you too Carla...

Walter sighs, then heads over to his cabinets, opens them
up -

A box of PANCAKE MIX is the only item -

Walter takes out the box and grabs a round, sharp-edged GRIDDLE out 
of the lower cabinets -

Soon the door knocks - Walter walks over to the door carrying the 
griddle -

He opens the door - Lou is standing there -

                    LOU
          Hello, Walter.

                    WALTER
          Hi.  I know you!  I've seen you
          down at the Jabberjaw plenty.

                    LOU
          Yes, you have.
               (Beat)
          Can I come in?

                    WALTER
          Uh, sure.

Walter closes the door behind him -

                    WALTER
          I was going to make some pancakes,
          you can have some if you like.

                    LOU
          Hm.

                     WALTER
          Did you see my cat?

                    LOU
          Yeah I did.

Lou heads over to the table, sees the medallion -

                    LOU
          I also saw the girl give you this.

                    WALTER
          Oh yeah that was Mayolia, she's
          a nice girl.
               (Beat)
          She's kind of strange, though.

Walter watches Lou take a dab of the white powdery contents and put 
it on his tongue -

                    LOU
          You like chasing the dragon, Walter?

                    WALTER
          Chasing the dragon?  Whaddya mean?
               (Beat)
          You sure you don't want a pancake?

                    LOU
          You can cut the crap.

Lou WHIPS out his BADGE -

Walter looks at the badge, then at Lou -

                    LOU
          Police officer.

                    WALTER
          You're like an undercover guy!
          
                    LOU
          You're in some deep shit pal, whether
          you know it or not.

                    WALTER
          Huh?!!!

                    LOU
          Possession of narcotics isn't something
          we take lightly, you understand?

Lou takes a few steps closer and Walter takes a few steps back -







                    LOU
          But I got a feeling you're gonna
          cooperate with me.  Yessir, I
          think you and me are gonna be real
          good friends.
               (Beat)
          Why don't you tell me about your
          connection.

                    WALTER
          C-connection?

                    LOU
          I'm not looking to pinch you!  I
          don't care about you, or the girl.
               (Beat)
          But you want to save your ass, you
          better start telling me what I want
          to hear.  Now!

                    WALTER
          Telling you what?

                    LOU
          Who's the head honcho!  Who's
          providing the smack connection!

                    WALTER
          Smack?

                    LOU
               (rolls his eyes)
          Goddammit, where are you from,
          Mars?

                    WALTER
          Alaska!  What the heck's wrong with
          it!

                    LOU
          Haven't you ever heard of smack!
          Horse!  Junk!  Heroin!

                    WALTER
               (enthusiastically)
          Is that what that is?  I never
          seen any before.  I always thought
          that stuff was expensive!

                    LOU
          Oh, yeah.  It can get real expensive.



                    WALTER
          Wasn't that nice of Mayolia to
          give me some expensive smack.

Walter heads over to the stove - Lou stops him, turns him around -
                    LOU
               (angry)
          Who do think you're dealing with,
          huh?  I'm willing to cut you a
          break, chief!

                    WALTER
               (totally confused)
          You are?

                    LOU
          Good ol' mild mannered Walter!
          Give it up.  It doesn't fly with
          me.

Lou steps up to Walter who cringes behind his griddle -

                    WALTER
          I- don't know what you're talking
          about!

                    LOU
          You're coming downtown with me,
          Walter.  You're gonna come clean
          with me, you're gonna name names
          or I swear to God I'll see to it
          personally you rot in a cell upstate!
          Are we understanding each other?

                    WALTER
               (panicked)
          Wait a minute!  What'd I do?

                    LOU
          I got you cold, pal.  Make
          it easy for yourself, use your
          head.

                    WALTER
          I didn't do nothing wrong!  That
          was Mayolia's!  I didn't ask her
          for it.  I don't know about any -

                    LOU
          Yeah yeah yeah - look!  I've
          heard this song and dance before,
          save your breath, you're coming with
          me!
Lou goes to turn Walter against the wall but Walter springs back -

                    WALTER
          Wait a minute - I told you I didn't
          do nothing wrong!

                    LOU     
          Don't give me a hard time Walter! You
          don't want to get me mad!  You're
          coming with me!

                    WALTER
          I ain't going no place with you!

Lou then grabs his .45 from behind him and aims it at
Walter -

                    LOU
          Turn around!

Walter panics and begins to FREAK OUT-

                    WALTER
          You're gonna shoot me!

                    LOU
          Turn around!

Lou lunges for Walter's arm to turn him around but he staggers back 
-

                    LOU
          What are ya, deaf?  Turn around!

                    WALTER
          NO! NO DON'T SHOOT ME I DON'T
          WANT TO GET SHOT!

                    LOU
          Relax!


                    WALTER
          YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME!

                    LOU
          Walter shut up and relax!

                    WALTER
          NO YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME DON'T
          SHOOT -

Lou SPRINGS for Walter -

WHAMMM! Walter SINKS the griddle into Lou's skull -  Lou grunts and 
crashes to the floor -

Walter cringes back in terror - as he steps back we see the BLOODY 
EDGE of the griddle -

Walter staggers back, witnessing what he has done -

Soon there is a KNOCKING on his door -

                    MRS. SWICKER(O.S.)
          Walter!

At first Walter is too shocked to hear the knocking, but soon he 
does, and a horrible realization forms in his mind -

EXT COURTYARD - NIGHT

Mrs. Swicker knocks on the door, listening intently -

                    MRS. SWICKER
          Walter!

She knocks again -

                    MRS. SWICKER
          Walter are you alright?  I thought
          I heard some shouting a minute ago!

Mrs. Swicker waits for a beat - soon she hears BANGING and CLANGING 
through the door -

                    MRS. SWICKER
          Walter!

The banging and clanging continues -

Mrs. Swicker knocks again - the banging reaches comical proportions 
-

                    MRS. SWICKER
          Walter open this door -
The clanging continues - Mrs. swicker jiggles the door handle - the 
door opens -

INT WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT

Mrs. Swicker walks in and Walter hides the bloody griddle in the 
nick of time, staggering back -

                    MRS. SWICKER
          What's all the noise in here!

                    WALTER
          Noise Mrs. Swicker?  What noise?

Mrs. Swicker closes the door behind her -

                    MRS. SWICKER
          Don't tell me I didn't hear a
          racket!  I'm an older woman and
          I don't need to be upset and
          disturbed in this manner!

                    WALTER
          I was just straightening up the
          place.

                    MRS. SWICKER
          Straightening up indeed!  Are you
          sure you're not alone?

                    WALTER
          I'm always alone, Mrs. Swicker,
          you know that.

Mrs. Swicker begins to snoop around the place -

                    MRS. SWICKER
          Walter have you been talking to
          yourself again?

                    WALTER
               (wringing his hands)
          Well yes I guess I have been Mrs.
          Swicker.  Somebody's got to.

Mrs. swicker continues to snoop around - she then turns and looks at 
Walter -

                    MRS. SWICKER
               (exasperated)
          Walter, you know what you need is
          a girl!

Mrs. Swicker continues to inspect the place, with Walter following 
close behind her -

                    MRS. SWICKER
          She doesn't have to be pretty...
          just as long as she takes good care
          of you...
          
                    WALTER
          Uh, I can take real good care of
          myself, Mrs. Swicker!

Mrs. Swicker continues to look around the cluttered room -

                    MRS. SWICKER
          Yeah I can see that! Look at
          this place!

At that moment Lou's BLOODY ARM drops into view in the background, 
having been stuffed in a crawl space above the sink -

                    MRS. SWICKER
          It's terrible!  Why don't you
          ever clean it up!

Walter notices the arm as Mrs. Swicker directs her attention in the 
opposite direction, grabbing a sheet -

                    MRS. SWICKER
          And when did you change these sheets
          last!  It looks like they're alive!

Walter panics, and gently leads Mrs. Swicker to the door -

                    WALTER
          Uh, Mrs. Swicker I got to meet some
          friends later, and I have to take
          a shower!

                    MRS. SWICKER
          Well why don't you clean up this
          dump!

Mrs. Swicker resists as Walter opens the door and pushes her out -

                    WALTER
          I will - good night Mrs. Swicker!

                    MRS. SWICKER
          What's the matter with you!

Walter shoves her out the door and closes it behind him -

Pressing his back against the door he looks ahead -

Blood begins to trickle down Lou's arm -

Walter approaches the bloody arm, caught in a total panic -

Blood begins to drop on the floor -

Walter looks around frantically, and finds a big metal POT -

He places it under the dripping blood, lowering it to the ground -

He then steps back, listening to the rhythmic trickle of blood 
hitting the pot -

Walter staggers back, grabbing a sponge -

He heads over to a PUDDLE of smeared blood on the floor -

He gets on his knees and begins to wipe up the blood -

                    WALTER
               (crying)
          I didn't mean to hurt you, sir...
          if you had shot me, you'd be
          mopping up my blood now...

Walter continues to mop up the stain -

                    WALTER
          I couldn't help it if I got scared.
          I didn't mean it!

Walter stops to listen to the trickling blood - something dawns on 
him -

                    WALTER
          It's crazy...it's crazy...
               (Beat)
          I didn't think I had it in me...
          How'd ya do it, Walter...

Walter gets up, faces Lou's off camera corpse and addresses it -
                    WALTER
          He said go home and make something
          Walter!  Make another cat...

Walter looks down at the pot filling with blood -


                    WALTER
          But I told him I didn't have
          another cat...

Walter then gets an idea, and looks up toward Lou's body -

Walter's expression changes, from one of panic to one of new 
inspiration -

Leonard enters and closes the door - he begins lifting shades and 
getting the place ready to open -

He heads over to the alcove, something catches his eye -

It is the Dead Cat sculpture -

Leonard stops to look at it, laughing faintly to himself - he then 
picks it up and inspects it, shaking his head -

He puts it back, positioning it just so - as he turns his back the 
cat leans forward and crashes to the ground -

Leonard turns around and sees what happened - he picks it up and 
examines it -

There is a FRACTURE in the plaster - Leonard runs his finger over it 
-

CLOSE on Leonard's face he notices something -

As Leonard traces his finger over the fracture, he discovers some 
CAT HAIRS protruding from the sculpture -

Taken aback by the discovery, Leonard puts the sculpture
down -

He then pokes it, almost as if he expects a response -
Leonard slowly breaks into a knowing smile -

                    LINK
          I know.

                    CUFF
          I mean it's like, you know, I do
          my art because that's what I am,
          you know?  I'm an artist.  I'm not
          like a banker, you know.  Like I
          create.

                    LINK
          I know, man.

                    CUFF
          But it bugs me when someone rips off
          our ideas, our concepts, and people
          freak out about it, you know, and
          tell us ours stinks!

                    LINK     
          I know, man.

                    CUFF
          I mean, screw them, you know?  I'm
          just gonna go right on creating
          'cause it comes from here -
               (pounds chest)
          you know?

                    LINK
          I know, man.

Just then Art enters the club -

Cuff and Link see him come in - Walter busses an adjacent table -

                    CUFF
          And, man who is this dude?  He's
          like always casing the joint.

A shady - looking couple behind Cuff and Link notice Art  also, and 
decide to hastily leave -

                    LINK
          I wonder what his deal is.

                    CUFF
          I think he's looking for you, man...
          it's all finally catching up with you!

Link sees Walter -

                    LINK
          No I think they're looking for Walter,
          'cause he's wanted for stealing -

Walter leaves with the tray pretending not to have heard the comment 
- he nevertheless CRASHES into a Leonard, spilling the contents of 
the tray -

                    CUFF
          Jeez, take it easy Walter!

Walter crouches and picks up the items -

Leonard looks down at him with disdain - Walter then stands
up -

                    WALTER
          Sorry about that Mr. De Santis!

Leonard says nothing for a beat -

                    LEONARD
          That's alright Walter...

Leonard then gestures to a table -

                    LEONARD
          Put the tray down...have a seat.

The comment takes Walter by surprise -
                    WALTER
          H-have a seat?

                    LEONARD
          Have a seat -

Cuff and Link watch as Walter sits down -

                    WALTER
          I thought I'm not supposed to
          sit with the customers...

                    LEONARD
          Now why shouldn't you, Walter?
          Things are different now...

                    WALTER
          They are?

Leonard sits down, facing him - he lights a cigarette -

                    LEONARD
          Of course they are, Walter.

Carla then makes her way toward their table -

                    LEONARD
          You've arrived.  You've been
          recognized.  You're a talent,
          a creative force to be reckoned
          with.

                    CARLA
          Leonard, what are you doing?

Leonard and Walter notice Carla -

                    WALTER
          Hiya Carla.

                    LEONARD
          What am I doing?  I'm just telling
          Walter the truth.

Carla sits down and listens -

                    LEONARD
          A man came in here and wanted to
          pay me fifty dollars for the cat.
          In fact, he took it home to show
          to his wife, in case you're wondering
          where it was.

Carla looks at Walter -

                    LEONARD
          You know what that proves?

                    WALTER
          What, Mr. De Santis?






                    LEONARD
          It proves I've underestimated
          Walter's ability.  His work has
          hit a nerve in the collective
          zeitgeist of the art community.                    
          It has enormous realism - you can
          hardly tell it from the real
          thing!

                    LINK
          Sounds like he's busting your
          chops, Walter.

                    CARLA
          Are you trying to be funny?

                    LEONARD
          I'm totally serious!

Leonard gets close to Walter - puts his hand on his
shoulder -

                    LEONARD
          The question is what are you going
          to make next, Walter?  Did you
          make that dog yet, or that parakeet?
               (beat)
          How about making something out of
          the cockroaches in your room?

                    WALTER
          I-I already got a new one!

                    CARLA
          Great!  What is it?

                    WALTER
          It's a...full length life-size
          figure!

                    CARLA
          What's it called?

                    WALTER
               (Beat)
          Murdered man.

Leonard takes his hand off Walter's shoulder -

                    LEONARD
          Murdered...man?...

                    CARLA
          When do we get to see it?
                    WALTER
          Well...any time, I guess.

                    LINK
               (sarcastically)
          Man that's a trippy name, kinda
          like the Warhol mayhem series...

                    CUFF
          I saw a statue once called The Third
          Time Phyllis Saw Me She Exploded.

                    LINK
          Now what kind of statue was that?

                    CUFF
          I don't know it was made out of
          driftwood and dipped in sulfuric
          acid.  It was out there...

                    LEONARD
          Well...why murdered man?

                    WALTER
          I don't know, it just happened,
          I guess.
               (Beat)
          I didn't mean to.

                    LEONARD
          You didn't mean to what?

                    WALTER
          Well, I mean it could have been
          something else, but it just
          worked out that way.

                    CARLA
          It's called spontaneity, Leonard.
          Get with the program.

                    WALTER
          Yeah it was all just an accident.

Leonard has suddenly become pale - he gets up -

                    CARLA
          Are you alright?

                    LEONARD
          Yes...I'm uh...I'm fine.

                    LINK
          You don't look so hot...
                    CUFF
          You must have had some of the
          food -

Cuff drops a chunk of whole wheat bread onto his plate -

Leonard composes himself -

                    LEONARD
          Excuse me...

Leonard heads off -

                    CARLA
          I think he really is sick...

                    LINK
          So who isn't around here?

Leonard heads over to the other end of the club -

A PLUMP MAN enters the club, looking around -

He spots Leonard, and makes his way toward him -

Leonard takes a deep breath - the plump man approaches -

                    PLUMP MAN
          I tried to contact you by phone
          but I couldn't...

                    LEONARD
          Excuse me I have to make a call...

Leonard picks up the phone and dials a number -

                    PLUMP MAN
          I want that cat.  I'll pay you one
          thousand dollars - cash.

                    LEONARD
               (on the phone)
          I'm trying to reach Lieutenant
          Beldere...

                    PLUMP MAN
          What offers have you got for it?
          I won't be out-bidded.  I'm a
          wealthy man and I don't mind
          paying for something I want.

                    LEONARD
          I can't talk right now.

                    PLUMP MAN
          What do you want for it?  Two thousand?
          Three thousand?

                    LEONARD
          No...look I'm busy...

                    PLUMP MAN
          Listen to me...I don't want to
          lose this piece -

                    LEONARD
               (on the phone)
          I'm holding for Lieutenant Beldere!

                    PLUMP MAN
          Listen to me, listen to me...I've
          been collecting art pieces all over
          the world for years and let me tell
          you something.  This newcomer
          Walter Paisley has it, whatever it
          is, the X factor, that indefinable
          quality that separates the greats from
          the hacks, and I want that cat in
          my hands.  Are you listening to me?

                    LEONARD
          Can't you see I'm busy here?

The plump man reaches inside his jacket -

                    PLUMP MAN
          Alright you want to play hard...
          to insure I get that cat I'll give
          you five thousand dollars - cash,
          right here, right now...

The plump man pulls an envelope out of his jacket - this gets 
Leonard's attention -

                    PLUMP          
          Two thousand for the cat, and
          a first look at the kid's next
          stuff.

Leonard looks at the plump man -

                    VOICE ON PHONE(V.O.)
          Lieutenant Beldere.

Leonard hangs up and faces the plump man -



                    LEONARD
          Someone has the cat just now but
          I'll have him back in a few days.
               (Beat)
          And you can have it for five thousand
          dollars.

The plump man breaks into a smile, pats Leonard on the arm and 
shakes his hand -

                    PLUMP MAN
          Alright...thank you sir, I
          consider it a bargain.
     
The plump man gives Leonard his card, and heads out -

                    PLUMP MAN
          Call me when you're ready...
          good night.

Leonard watches him leave - Leonard takes a deep breath as carla 
approaches him -

                    CARLA
          Are you feeling better Leonard?

Leonard looks at her -

                    LEONARD
          Yeah, I'm feeling a lot better.

                    CARLA
          Listen, I'm going over to Walter's
          after the place closes.  I want to
          get a look at Murdered Man.  Do you
          want to come along?

Leonard looks at her for a beat, then nods -

Onstage, the industrial musician finishes up his song, and the crowd 
applauds -
                                             DISSOLVE TO
INT WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT

The door opens and Walter walks in, followed by Carla and Leonard -

Walter turns on the overhead lamp - Int the center of the room is a 
TALL OBJECT covered by a sheet -
Leonard closes the door behind him -

Carla looks at the object -


                    CARLA
          Look at the size of it!

                    WALTER
          It's not really that big I got
          it on kind of a stand...

                    CARLA
          Let's see it.

                    WALTER
          Uh, well, I'm a little nervous,
          I never did a person before.

                    CARLA
          You can do anything you want if
          you set your mind to it.

Leonard leans back against the door and swallows -

                    LEONARD
          It's hot in here...

                    WALTER
          You want me to open a window or
          something?

                    CARLA
          Come on Walter, take off the
          sheet.

Walter obliges, pulling down the sheet to reveal his creation -

It is LOU, standing upright and looking down at the three spectators 
- his skull is CLEAVED right down the middle from the top of his 
head to the bridge of his nose -

Leonard and Carla stare in dumbstruck silence -

Walter looks at their expressions, clutching the sheet -

                    WALTER
          Don't you like it?

Carla continues to stare for a beat -

                    CARLA
          Like it?
               (Beat)
          It's a masterpiece.  I've never
          seen anything like it before...
          and I hope I never see anything
          like it again.
Walter smiles and looks at his creation -

                    WALTER
          Me too.

                    LEONARD
          I have to sit down.

Carla walks around the statue -

                    CARLA
          Take it in...in it's eloquence...
          modern man in all his...self
          pity...

Leonard drops down onto a hardwood chair -

                    CARLA
          How did you ever find it all
          in yourself, Walter?

                    WALTER
          It wasn't easy.

Carla looks back at Leonard, who has an ashen look on his
face -
                    CARLA
          What's the matter with you?

                    LEONARD
          Nothing...nothing at all.

                    CARLA
          I've never seen anyone so...
          squeamish.
               (Beat)
          Well, what's your opinion,
          Leonard?

                    LEONARD
          Don't ask.

                    CARLA
          Oh come on!  Even you can see
          its value.

The head stares back at the two -

                    CARLA
          Do you think you or I could have
          conceived of such a thing, much
          less have executed it?

Leonard says nothing -

                    CARLA
          Well then admit it, it's a work
          of genius.

                    LEONARD
          I admit it.

Walter heads over to Leonard -

                    WALTER
          We can bring it down to the
          Jabberjaw.

Leonard gets up -

                    LEONARD
          No.  Why don't you cover it up
          Walter...

                    CARLA
          Why not?

                    LEONARD
          Why don't you cover it up, Walter!

Walter throws the sheet back over the sculpture -

                    CARLA
          What's wrong with you, why do
          you want to hide it?

                    LEONARD
          Well, I've been thinking...
               (Beat)
          I didn't realize how much...talent
          Walter actually had.  It would be
          wrong for us to show them one at
          a time.
               (Beat)
          Dead wrong.

                    CARLA
          You're right.  We should build a
          collection first.

Leonard backs up, looking at the two of them -

                    LEONARD
          That's it...that's the idea!
          Maybe when it's big enough we
          can have a show!

Walter rushes over to Leonard -

                    WALTER
          A show?!  Like this Sunday?

                    LEONARD
          N-no!  Not exactly, I mean you
          take years and years...

Leonard looks at the sculpture, composing himself -

                    LEONARD
          It will take years to make that
          many statues.
               (Beat)
          But your work would be featured.

                    CARLA
          That's the idea, Walter.  It's the
          only way to gain recognition. All
          the big art critics and art dealers
          would be there, it would be an
          event.

                    LEONARD
          Yeah then you could unload - sell
          this stuff for a lot more.

                    WALTER
          A show..how soon can we go?

                    LEONARD
          These things take time Walter...
          but for now you've got to break
          out of this one...avenue you're
          on...

Leonard heads over to Carla -

                    LEONARD
          Carla and I will guide you, help
          develop and evolve your work...maybe
          lead you toward something more abstract...

                    CARLA
          Abstract?  With his talent for realism?

                    LEONARD
          You see the direction his realism
          takes! It's unhealthy!

                    WALTER
          Look you said I was a genius!  If
          I'm a genius I don't want to be a
          bus boy anymore!
                    LEONARD
          Well maybe you have a point there,
          you shouldn't keep working at the
          Jabberjaw.  Look...

Leonard digs into his pocket and peels off TWO HUNDRED
FIFTY DOLLARS -

                    LEONARD
          Now look - Dead Cat's money in
          the bank, I'm sure that man's going
          to buy it, so here's your half
          in advance - twenty five dollars.

Leonard hands the money to an ecstatic Walter -

                    LEONARD
          And if you need more, I've got it,
          don't worry.
               (Beat)
          I have faith in you Walter.

Walter heads over to Carla holding up the money and smiling like a 
simpleton -

                    WALTER
          Gee..twenty five dollars for
          something I made!

                    CARLA
          Now you're a professional!

Leonard heads over to the door and opens it -

                    LEONARD
          Let's go!

Carla gives a look of attraction to Walter and heads toward the door 
-

                    CARLA
          Good night, Walter.  And keep
          up the good work.

Walter smiles at her as Leonard gently takes her arm -

                    LEONARD
          But don't burn yourself out, Walter.
          You've got all the time in the
          world.
               (Beat)
          Let's go!

Leonard pulls Carla into the courtyard -

Walter heads over to the door -

                    WALTER
          Good night.

Walter closes the door and gazes at the money again - he is truly 
thrilled, and begins to JUMP around the room, HOOTING and HOLLERING 
-

EXT COURTYARD - NIGHT

Mrs. Swicker walks by Walter's door, overhearing him carrying on -

INT WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT

Mrs. Swicker opens the door watching Walter jumping around -
                    
                    MRS. SWICKER
          What's going on!

Walter SPINS around and stops jumping - he runs over to Mrs. Swicker 
holding the money -

                    WALTER
          I'm an artist Mrs. Swicker!  A
          professional artist!

Walter YANKS the sheet off the statue -

Mrs. Swicker stares at the apparition, looking as if she's about to 
lose her lunch -

She gently back up into the hall -

                    MRS. SWICKER
          Good night...

Mrs. Swicker closes the door abruptly -

Walter turns around, and gleefully continues to stare at the money -
                                             DISSOLVE TO

INT JABBERJAW - NIGHT

Another busy night at the club - a DJ spins a hybrid assortment of 
records resulting in a most irritating sound -

Leonard sits close to Carla, smoking, as she nurses a glass of wine 
-

Art arrives again, looking around the room -

He passes Maxwell, who sits at a table with Mayolia, Charlie, and an 
attractive blond girl - once again, Maxwell is somewhat intoxicated 
-

                    MAXWELL
          One of the greatest advantages
          to modern poetry is the overload
          of sensations from which to draw,
          everywhere in our minute lives,
          our TV's and our information
          traffic jam!  The goal is to
          filter those sensations to
          articulate our awareness!  And                    
          I'm proud to say my poetry is
          understood only by that small
          minority which is...aware!

                    ATTRACTIVE GIRL
          Aware of what?

                    MAYOLIA
          Not of anything stupid!  Just
          aware!

Art passes Cuff and Link, sitting at a table smoking cigarettes -

                    CUFF
          There's that weird dude again.

                    LINK
          Man if this place doesn't cool
          out I'm gonna hang out somewhere
          else...

The singer continues to sing his song - Link then sees something -

                    LINK          
          Get a load of this -

Then Walter walks through the front door - his look has changed 
considerably - he's dressed like an eccentric artist, wearing 
unusual clothes, and looking somewhat ridiculous - he strides into 
the club -

People notice him and greet him as he nods to various
people -

A couple points, and talks about him -

He passes Leonard and Carla - Leonard does a double-take -

                    CARLA
          Hi Walter.

                    WALTER
          Carla...

Walter sits down at a table next to Leonard and Carla - a waiter 
approaches -

                    WALTER
          I'll have a Taft's-Sorrel mineral
          water, a piece of papaya cheese
          cake, and, and a grande cappuccino.

Walter lights up a small CIGAR, looking at Carla
confidently - a piece of TOBACCO gets stuck on his lip, which he has 
to spit off -

Maxwell approaches Walter's table and extends his hand -

                    MAXWELL
          Walter.

Walter shakes his hand -

                    WALTER
          Maxwell.

                    MAXWELL
          I see the rewards of achievement
          have come your way.

Maxwell sits down -

                    WALTER
          Well I am starting to have some
          success now, with my pieces...

Cuff and Link witness the encounter -

                    CUFF
          Man look at that get up !

                    LINK          
          Looks like that cat paid
          off in spades.

                    CUFF
          Let's check out the scene.

Cuff gets up -

                    LINK          
          I'm with you.

Leonard stands and addresses Maxwell and Walter -

                    LEONARD
          I was just suggesting to Walter
          that he experiment with more
          abstract themes.

Maxwell looks at Leonard with contempt -

                    MAXWELL
          Why do you suggest anything to
          Walter?  Are you the spokesman
          for society coming to poke
          your stifling finger in his
          eye!

Cuff and Link show up -

                    CUFF
          And a hearty good evening to ya!

Cuff and link sit down, flanking Maxwell, who shifts and looks at 
the two of them - Leonard sits back down with
Carla -

                    MAXWELL
          Oh now who invited these two, down
          from the clouds?

                    WOMAN'S VOICE(O.S.)
          Maxwell!

Maxwell turns -

We see the shrill voice belongs to ALICE, a well-developed blonde in 
a tight sweater, who makes her way toward the table -

                    MAXWELL
          Clear the table and bring me
          a bowl, I may be sick!

Alice approaches the table -

                    CUFF
          It's Alice Ziobro, here to
          spread a little cheer -

Alice looks at Maxwell -

                    ALICE
          Do you like my haircut?

                    MAXWELL
          It's enchanting.

Alice takes a seat near Cuff and Link -

                    CARLA
          Where have you been, Alice?

                    ALICE
               (smugly)
          I was up in Seattle working on a
          video.

                    LINK
          Oh yeah?  For who?

                    ALICE
          Petroleum Function.

                    LINK
          No way!

                    ALICE
          Yeah it's for their new CD.

Alice then turns her attention to Walter -

                    ALICE
               (disdainfully)
          Don't you work here?

                    WALTER
          Not anymore!

                    MAXWELL
          That's right, Walter has sold
          his first sculpture.

Alice is unimpressed by the news -

                    ALICE
          Oh.  Really.

Cuff gets close to Alice -

                    CUFF
          This guy's a clown and he ripped
          off our concepts.

                    ALICE
          Oh yeah?



                    CUFF
          Now he's trying to act cool about
          it.
               (Beat)
          Someone needs to pop his bubble.

                    ALICE
          What are you thinking?          

Cuff whispers to Alice, and the two of them start laughing -

                    MAXWELL
          And what project looms on the
          horizon, Walter?

                    WALTER
          Uh, I don't know.

Alice faces Walter -

                    ALICE
          I do life modeling, you know.

Walter looks at Alice -

                    ALICE
          Would you like to do me?

                    WALTER
          I just might.

                    ALICE
          I'd be glad to help.
               (Beat)
          For $50 an hour.

Cuff and Link crack up -

                    LEONARD
          Never mind that.  Walter's going
          to try something abstract.

                    MAXWELL
          There you go again!  I may take my
          business to the Snake Pit!

                    CARLA
          As a matter of fact I was going to
          suggest to Walter that he try a
          female figure.  It would be a
          departure from the mayhem/death
          theme.  You really should, Walter.

Carla looks at him -
                    CARLA
          If you like, I'll be your model,
          for free.

Walter looks at her -
                    
                    WALTER
          I couldn't.  Not you.

Leonard gets closer to Carla -

                    LEONARD
               (suggestively)
          Would you pose for me for free?

                    CARLA
          Well, it all depends, Leonard...

Walter sees this and is FLUSHED WITH JEALOUSY -

                    CUFF
          Man if you want to be a legit
          artist you have to do nudes,
          nudes, nudes...

                    LINK
          Right.  Ain't no body of
          work complete without some...
          nudes -

This is about all Maxwell can take - Cuff cackles like a buffoon -

                    MAXWELL
          Get these Philistines out of here!

                    ALICE
          Oh let's change the subject I'm
          sick of hearing about sculpture!
          No one knows how to do that anymore,
          especially the bus boy from the
          Jabberjaw...

                    WALTER
          Who do you think you're talking
          about!!

Alice laughs condescendingly -

                    ALICE
          Look at you!  Who do think you
          are.  You're just a poser trying,
          and failing, to fit into the scene!

                    MAXWELL
          Strong words...
               (under his breath)
          ...for such a simple mind.

                    ALICE
          I think this bit about him being
          this discovered sculptor is a
          bunch of baloney and a cry for
          help.          

                    WALTER
          That's not true I am a sculptor!

                    ALICE
          Oh yeah?

Alice picks up a piece of CAKE -

                    ALICE
          Prove it!  Make something out
          of this!

Walter SMUSHES the cake onto Alice's palm -

                    WALTER
          There!  Flat Cake!

Maxwell BELLOWS with laughter - Alice wipes off her hand -

                    ALICE
          If you were an artist you could
          have created something!

                    WALTER
          I'm going home!

Walter gets up and leaves -

Carla turns and raises her glass to Alice, smiling -

                    CARLA
          Alice?
               (smile fades)
          You're a bitch.

Dejected, Walter makes his way out of the club, storming past 
Mayolia -

Mayolia watches Walter leave -

                                             DISSOLVE TO


EXT JABBERJAW - NIGHT

Alice makes her way out the door - heads down the steps and walks 
off -

Then out of the shadows we see Walter, who has been waiting for her 
to leave -

When the coast is clear, he begins to follow her...

EXT BUNGALOW - NIGHT

Alice enters the courtyard - she walks over to the front door of her 
bungalow, enters, and closes the door behind
her -

Just then Walter stealthily enters the courtyard -

He approaches Alice's door, waits a beat, then gently
knocks -

Alice opens the door and looks at Walter -

                    ALICE
          What are you doing here?

                    WALTER
          I wanted to apologize for
          being nasty to you this evening.

Alice is unimpressed -

                    ALICE
          So you apologized!  Good night!

Alice SLAMS the door right in Walter's face -

Walter takes a few steps back - he clenches his jaw then BANGS on 
the door -

Alice RIPS the door open -

                    ALICE
          Listen schmuck, why don't you
          get out of here and let me go
          to bed!

                    WALTER
          I didn't finish talking to you!

                    ALICE
          Well I'm done talking to you, what
          do I have to do, draw you a diagram!

                    WALTER
          I decided to make a female figure
          after all!
               (Beat)
          I want you to pose for it.

Alice looks him up and down for a beat, changing her tone -

                    ALICE
               (sarcastic)
          Well I'm touched.
               (beat)
          You're serious, aren't you?

                    WALTER
          Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?

                    ALICE
          Yeah.

Alice laughs, and stares at Walter for a beat -

                    ALICE
          Well, if you've got the money, I
          don't mind posing.
               (Beat)
          When do you want to start work?

Walter looks up at her sheepishly -

                    WALTER
          Tonight.

                    ALICE
          What, right now?

                    WALTER
          Uh-huh.

Alice looks him up and down again -

                    ALICE
          Hold on...I'll get my coat.

                                             DISSOLVE TO
EXT COURTYARD - NIGHT

Walter and Alice head over to his front door -

                    ALICE
          It's kind of dark -

                    WALTER
          Shh!

Alice shuts up and the two of them quietly head into him room, 
closing the door -

Just then Mrs. Swicker opens her door down the hall, poking her head 
out -

INT WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT

Alice begins to undress -

                    ALICE
          You could use a little more
          heat in this place -

Walter drags a big bag of PLASTER out of a closet - he drags it to a 
new addition in the room, a large TROUGH -

                    WALTER
          It's bad for the clay. You'll
          get used to it...

Walter then props up a chair -

                    ALICE
          I'm almost ready -           

                    WALTER
          Sit in this chair, and I'll pose
          you.

Walter heads over to the lump of clay on the table -

Alice sits down, back to camera, totally nude -

                    ALICE
          Do you like what you see?

Walter does a double take, and swallows hard at the voluptuous 
figure before him -

                    WALTER
          Yes.
               (Beat)
          Just stay like that.

Walter nervously kneads the clay -

                    ALICE
          That doesn't look like very
          much clay.

                    WALTER
          Oh it's enough...

                    ALICE
          Are you nervous, Walter?

                    WALTER
          N-no...

Alice sexily shifts in her seat -

                    ALICE
          Not even a little bit?

                    WALTER
          I already told you I'm not.

                    ALICE
          When's the last time you had a
          totally nude girl in your room...

                    WALTER
               (swallows)
          Um...

                    ALICE
          Without a stitch of clothing on,
          sitting and facing you...

Walter fumbles with the clay -

                    ALICE
          A girl with a body like mine?                    

                    WALTER
          You're breaking my concentration!

Alice laughs -

                    ALICE
          Walter can I ask you something?

                    WALTER
          What!

                    ALICE
          Are you a virgin?

Walter stands up -

                    WALTER
          For cryin' out loud what does
          that have to do with anything!



                    ALICE
          It's just an innocent question.
               (Beat)
          Besides I just wanted to clarify
          your intentions.

                    WALTER
          Whaddya mean?

                    ALICE
          Well I just wanted to make sure
          you know, fully and completely,
          that you're never gonna get any
          from me, at least in this lifetime.

This comment stings Walter - he clenches his jaw, and gets up -

                    WALTER
          Look -
               (Beat)
          This pose is all wrong!

                    ALICE
          I'll pose any way you want.

Walter then grabs up a SCARF, and approaches Alice -

Walter then hands the scarf to Alice -

                    WALTER
          I want you to put this around
          your neck...

Alice takes the scarf and places it around her neck -

                    WALTER
          Just like that...that's right.

Walter then steps behind Alice, grabbing the ends of the scarf 
gently -

Then suddenly Walter PULLS the ends hard, choking Alice -

Alice clutches the scarf and struggles, panicking and gasping for 
air -

Walter tugs at the scarf with all his might -

Alice kicks and tries to free herself, to no avail -

Walter continues to strangle her, clenching his jaws -


INT CARLA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Carla, Maxwell, Cuff, Link, and another girl sit around the living 
room - Carla hands Maxwell a plate -

Maxwell inspects the plate -

                    CARLA
          Here you go, enjoy.
          
                    MAXWELL
          I hope this was made with egg
          whites!

                    CARLA
          It was.

                    MAXWELL
          What's this sauce!  I'm lactose
          intolerant.

                    CARLA
          Don't worry it's a non-dairy
          sauce made from soy milk.

                    MAXWELL
          Hm.

Maxwell takes a bite - someone knocks at the door and Cuff goes to 
answer it -

Cuff answers the door -

                    CUFF
          Hey it's mister perjury!          

In walks Walter, who notices everyone there -

                    WALTER
          Hi.

                    MAXWELL
          Good morning Walter!


Walter approaches Carla, a little dejected he wasn't
invited -

                    WALTER
          Hi Carla.
               (Beat)
          What's going on?


                    CARLA
          These guys came by to help me
          try out some of my new organic
          recipes.
               
                    WALTER
          Oh...

                    MAXWELL
          Wheat germ omelette, guava nectar
          and garbanzo sprinkled with smoked
          yeast.  Join us?

                    WALTER
          No thanks.  Sounds good though.

                    MAXWELL
          Suit yourself.

                    CARLA
          What's up, Walter?

                    WALTER
          I came over to see you.
               (Beat)
          I brought something...I
          wanted to show you.

                    CARLA
          Oh yeah?

                    WALTER
          Yeah.  Can some of you guys help me?

Maxwell puts down his plate -

                    CARLA
          Is it murdered man?

                    WALTER
          Better!

Carla gets up -

                    CARLA
          Come on!

Maxwell claps his hands twice, not getting up -

                    MAXWELL
          All hands!

Cuff and Link follow Carla -
                                             DISSOLVE TO
INT CARLA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Walter, Cuff, and Link carry an OBJECT covered by a sheet - Maxwell 
watches -

                    LINK
          Man this is heavy!

                    CUFF
          Yeah what's this, Murdered Elephant?

                    MAXWELL
          Put it in the middle of the room!

                    CARLA
          When did you make this, Walter?

                    WALTER
          Uh, last night.  It doesn't take me
          very long.

The men put the object down, out of breath -

                    CUFF
          Well let's see it, man!

Walter undoes a string and lifts off the sheet to reveal -

ALICE, naked and seated in a chair, clutching at a scarf around her 
throat -

Everyone stares at it in awe -

                    CARLA
          Walter...I can't believe it.

                    MAXWELL
          I'm honored to know this man.

                    WALTER
          So you think it's nice?

                    LINK
          Man, she's beautiful.


                    WALTER
               (to Carla)
          You think she's better than Murdered
          Man?

                    CARLA
          Well I can't say that Walter!  She's
          incomparable.  They're both great.

                    MAXWELL
          I'm...moved.  I'm moved to write
          about this!
               (Beat)
          Tonight, at the Jabberjaw, I will
          recite a new poem, and we'll
          celebrate in your honor!

Maxwell puts his hand on Walter' shoulder -

Carla then kisses Walter, a peck on the lips - Walter is 
flabbergasted -

INT JABBERJAW - NIGHT

A LOUD BAND wraps up a song, and the singer CRASHES into the drum 
set - people applaud -

Walter sits in a big wooden chair with a paper CROWN on his head and 
a paper STAR on his lapel, looking a little tipsy - in one hand is a 
GOBLET, in the other a PLUNGER -

Art and a new UNDERCOVER COP stand at the entrance of the club -

                    ART
          Alright, let's split up and keep
          a low profile.  You hear anything,
          you let me know.

The undercover cop nods, and heads off -

                    ART
          I'm going to get to the bottom
          of this...

Carla approaches Walter with a bottle of CHAMPAGNE -

                    CARLA
          More champagne, your majesty?

                    WALTER
          Here here...

Carla pours some into the goblet -

                    CARLA
          Where where...

                    WALTER
          There there...

The goblet overflows -

                    WALTER
          That's good...

Carla sits down next to Walter on the edge of the stage - Walter 
leans over to her with a drunken smile on his face -

                    WALTER
          May I please have another little
          kiss?

                    CARLA
          Walter!  Jeez!

                    WALTER
               (smile fades)
          Sorry...

Carla laughs - Walter smiles again and Carla puts her head against 
his arm -

Leonard surveys the crowd from another part of the room -

Maxwell then heads to the stage where Walter is sitting and raises 
his hands -

Scattered applause erupts -

                    MAXWELL
          Order!  Order!

The crowd quiets down as Maxwell puts his hand on Walter's shoulder 
-

                    MAXWELL
          Walter...
               (booming voice)
          The bird that flies now pays
          later through the nose of
          ambidextrous apathy -

Walter strains to understand -

                    MAXWELL
          Necrophiles may dance upon the
          placemats in an orgy of
          togetherness -

Walter looks around the room as Maxwell gathers steam -





                    MAXWELL
          The highway of life cuts sharply
          through the shady ghettos and the
          ivy-covered tombs, and laughter
          rains from every capsule in the
          star-spangled firmament -

Cuff, Link, and Mayolia listen from an adjacent table -

                    MAXWELL(O.S.)
          And in the deep freeze it is the
          children's hour -

Maxwell punches holes in the air with his finger -

                    MAXWELL
          And no one knows that Duncan is
          murdered and no one knows that
          Walter Paisley is born -

Maxwell slaps his hand on Walter's shoulder, spilling some of 
Walter's champagne - Walter smiles and looks at Maxwell through his 
drunken haze -

                    MAXWELL
               (getting louder)
          Duncan knows...Tuesday sunrise
          knows...alley cats and garbage cans
          and satellite dishes, and you and I,
          and the nude descending the staircase,
          and all such things with souls, we
          shall hear that Walter Paisley is born!

Walter looks at Maxwell with a half-smile, completely lost -

                    MAXWELL
               (loud)
          Ring rubber bells!  Beat cotton
          gongs!  Strike silken cymbals!  Play
          leather flutes -

Leonard listens with a blank expression on his face -

Art slouches at a table and looks at Maxwell like he's a jerk - he 
shifts, unable to take much more of this -

                    MAXWELL(O.S.)
          The cats and cans and you and I
          and all such things with souls,
          we shall hear that Walter Paisley
          is born!

Maxwell raises his clenched fists -

                    MAXWELL
          And the soul become flesh - Walter
          Paisley is born!

Maxwell stands back - people applaud, and Maxwell bows his head and 
leaves the stage -

Cuff claps enthusiastically - Link slouches behind him, half-
clapping - Mayolia seems too moved to clap -

                    CUFF
          That was cool, man, that was cool.

                    MAYOLIA
          That was the greatest rap I ever
          heard!

                    CUFF
          It sent me.

Cuff then turns to Link -

                    CUFF
          What did he say?

                    LINK          
          Didn't you hear him?

                    CUFF
          No man I'm on my own plane.

Walter sits onstage by himself, still holding his plunger -

Maxwell sits down at a table with Charlie and two attractive girls -

                    CHARLIE
          Maxwell that was magnificent.

Maxwell slugs back the rest of his champagne -

                    1ST PRETTY GIRL
          You're really...eloquent.

Maxwell clunks the glass on the table -

                    MAXWELL
          Walter deserves every word of it!

                    1ST PRETTY GIRL
          Makes me so glad I'm aware.

Maxwell puts his hand over the girl's hand -

Carla approaches Walter, who reels a bit in the chair - he has a sad 
look on his face -

                    WALTER
          Did you hear what he said?

                    CARLA
          Yes Walter.

                    WALTER
          All about me...

Carla nods and smiles -

                    WALTER
          It's true, isn't it?

                    CARLA
          Every word...

Walter slowly smiles -

                                             DISSOLVE TO
INT JABBERJAW - NIGHT

The crowd has thinned out, people are leaving -

Walter polishes off the dregs of a bottle of champagne as Leonard 
watches him -

                    LEONARD
          You better hold off on the
          bubbly.

                    WALTER
          Yeah, why?

                    LEONARD
          You might talk too much.

                    WALTER
          Yeah and what would I say?

                    MAXWELL(O.S.)
          Are you two grinders ignoring us?

Walter staggers over toward Maxwell, who is sitting with Carla, 
Charlie, and the two attractive girls -

                    WALTER
          Oh not me Maxwell, I wouldn't
          ignore you.

He puts his hand on Maxwell's shoulder -

                    WALTER
          I know what it is to be ignored.

                    CARLA
          Tell us what you're going to
          make next, Walter.

                    WALTER
               (reeling)
          I'm gonna make the most wildest
          wittiest things you ever seen...
          gonna make big statues and li'l
          statues, tall statues n' short
          statues...

Walter takes his crown off -

                    WALTER
          I'm gonna make statues of nobodies
          and statues of famous people, statues
          of actors -
               (looking at Maxwell)
          and poets...and people who sell things
          on television...and a statue of the
          mayor, and some rock singers and
          their instrument friends...

The group listens to Walter -

                    WALTER
          An' everyone will say Walter let
          me shake your hand...it's a real
          pleasure to have known you...

                    MAXWELL
               (applauding)
          Here here!

The group claps -

Leonard watches in the background as Walter polishes off his glass -

                                             DISSOLVE TO
EXT STREET - NIGHT

Walter staggers down the street -

                    WALTER
          Alley cats and garbage cans...they
          know that Walter Paisley is born...

Walter removes the star from his lapel and continues to stagger down 
the street -

                    WALTER
          Ring rubber bells, beat cotton
          gongs, strike silken cymbals...

Walter turns the corner -

                    WALTER
          Tell us what you're gonna do
          next Walter...

Walter bounces against a wall -

                    WALTER
               (loud)
          I'm gonna make big statues and
          little statues, movie stars and
          poets, and people who sell things
          on television, and the mayor, and
          some rock singers...

Walter stops walking and leans his hand against the wall -

                    WALTER
               (Beat)
          What are you gonna do next, Walter?

Walter all of a sudden gets a sad look on his face -

                    WALTER
          What am I gonna do next...
          what am I gonna do next...

Walter looks like he's about to cry -

                    WALTER
          I gotta do something before they
          forget me...I know what it's like
          to be ignored...

Walter thinks, then heads off, down the alley -

EXT LUMBER YARD  - NIGHT

CLOSE on a table saw - a CARPENTER pulls the saw over a piece of 
wood, then turns it off -

He picks up the wood and inspects the cut - he then turns around, 
only to be startled by Walter -

                    CARPENTER
          Who are you?  Whaddya want?
                    WALTER
               (slurred)
          Life is nothing but a homeless
          guy on th' bus of art...
          
                    CARPENTER
          Huh?

Walter gets RIGHT in the carpenter's face -

                    WALTER
               (slurred)
          What is not creation is rice
          cakes...let them all crumble
          to feed the creator...

The carpenter stares at him for a beat, trying to avoid Walter's 
boozy breath -

                    CARPENTER
          Beat it, ya drunk, or I'll call
          the cops!

The carpenter turns the saw back on -

Walter SPINS the man around by his shoulder -

                    WALTER
               (loud, slurred)
          All else is rice cakes!

The carpenter SHOVES Walter hard - he lands on his ass -

                    CARPENTER
          Get out of here, you god - damn
          freak or I'll split your head
          with a two-by-four!

Walter staggers to his feet and takes a few steps back - the 
carpenter gives him a wary look for a beat and then continues sawing 
-

Walter then POUNCES on the man, choking him -

The carpenter tries to fight back but Walter is possessed with a 
psychotic strength -

Walter begins to gain the upper hand forcing the man's neck closer 
and closer to the sawblade -

The carpenter sees the blade, and struggles with all his might to 
get free -


                    CARPENTER
          No...no!

Walter forces the man's face down on the metal -

                    CARPENTER
          Stop...no...NOOOOOO!


The saw makes a CUTTING noise -

                    CARPENTER
          Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
                                             FADE OUT

EXT JABBERJAW - DAY

Leonard gets a PAPER out of a VENDING MACHINE -

He reads the headline - "HEADLESS MAN FOUND IN LUMBERYARD"

Leonard reads it for a beat -

Walter then approaches, carrying a box -

                    WALTER
          Hello Leonard!  Beautiful morning,
          isn't it?

                    LEONARD
          It was.

Leonard lowers the paper - his face drops -

                    LEONARD
          What do you have in the box?

                    WALTER
          Just wait till you see this!

Walter opens the box and removes the contents -

It is the HEAD of the carpenter - Walter shoves the sculpture in 
Leonard's face -

Leonard drops the paper and staggers back -

                    WALTER
          Whatsamatter Leonard?

                    LEONARD
               (Beat)
          You made...a bust...
                    WALTER
               (gleefully)
          Yeah isn't it wonderful?

Leonard takes a few steps back -

                    WALTER
          Whatsamatter Leonard?

                    LEONARD
          Put it down, Walter.

Walter's smile fades, and he puts the head down - Leonard addresses 
him -

                    LEONARD
          Walter...Walter listen carefully.
               (Beat)
          I don't want you to make any
          more statues.  Do you understand?
          No more statues.

                    WALTER
               (hurt)
          Well Why not?  I gotta make statues
          Leonard.  You heard Maxwell, they
          want me to make them.
               (Beat)
          I can't go back to being a busboy!

                    LEONARD
          Maxwell!  He's behind all this with
          all his stupid blowhard poetry!
               (Beat)
          Listen, you've got to stop right
          away!  I'm beginning to feel
          responsible!

                    WALTER
          Well, w-what did you do?

                    LEONARD
          Never mind...

Leonard puts his arm around Walter -

                    LEONARD
          Walter...I decided to have that
          show for you, right away.

Walter walks with Leonard -



                    LEONARD
          When Carla comes by I'll talk to
          her.  She'll make up some nice
          invitations.  We'll have them
          printed up.

                    WALTER
          Yeah?

                    LEONARD
          Well invite the critics, and the
          art collectors...we'll tell them...

                                             DISSOLVE TO

INT CARLA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

INSERT INVITATION - a fancy invitation to the Jabberjaw to showcase 
the work of Walter Paisley -

Mayolia fixes up the back of Carla's dress - Cuff and Link slouch in 
chairs, and Maxwell fumbles with his tie, dressed formally -

                    MAYOLIA
          Well I don't see why we can't
          go!

                    MAXWELL
          Mister Leonard De Santis is afraid
          to have you come.  You who buy
          his coffee, his potables, his food.
          You are the heart and soul and meat
          of the Jabberjaw.
               (Beat)
          And he slighted you!

                    CUFF
          Did you get an invitation?

                    MAXWELL
          I did not!  But I'm going anyway.
          Not to drink his champagne but
          to see Walter's triumph.

Just then Walter walks through the front door, dressed to the nines 
-

                    MAXWELL
          After that we go no more!

                    WALTER
          Hiya Maxwell.

Maxwell pats Walter's arm -

                    MAXWELL
          I won't say good luck, Walter.

                    WALTER
          Why not?

                    MAXWELL
          It would imply you could not
          succeed on your ability alone!

Maxwell dramatically exits -

Walter watches him, then heads over to Carla, and smiles -

                    CARLA
          You look so handsome.

Walter looks down at his outfit -

                    WALTER
          I do?

Walter then looks at Carla -

                    WALTER
          So do you.

Cuff and Link crack up at his comment -

                    WALTER
          I mean, you look so pretty.
          
                    CARLA
          Thank you.

                    WALTER
          Are you ready?

                    CARLA
          Ready?  We've got plenty of time.

                    WALTER
          I know.  But I wanted to talk to
          you.

Carla looks at Walter for a beat -

                    CARLA
          Ok...

Carla grabs her coat and bag -

                    CARLA
          We can go now if you like.

Walter and carla head out -

                    CARLA
               (to the others)
          Goodbye.

                    WALTER
          Bye!

                    LINK
               (dryly)
          Break a leg.

Walter and Carla head out, closing the door behind them -

                    CUFF
          Man, why do you suppose Walter
          wants to get her alone?
               (Beat)
          You suppose he could be physically
          attracted to her?

                    LINK     
          No man, he ain't the type.  He
          don't get enough vitamin E.

                    CUFF
          Maxwell gave him a bottle of
          wheat germ oil.  Maybe he started
          taking it.

EXT STREET - NIGHT

Walter and Carla walk down the street - Walter says
nothing -

                    CARLA
          Nice night out...

                    WALTER
          Hm...

The two say nothing for a beat -

                    CARLA
          Well...what did you want to
          talk to me about?

                    WALTER
          Well...w-what kind of people do
          you like, Carla?

                    CARLA
          Oh, I don't know.  Smart people.
          Creative people I guess.

                    WALTER
          You think I'm creative?

                    CARLA
          Of course I do!

                    WALTER
          That means you like me!

Carla looks at Walter -

                    CARLA
          I like you very much, Walter.

                    WALTER
          I thought you did on account of
          you kissed me the other night!

Carla sees where this is going and doesn't like it - the two stop 
walking -

                    CARLA
          Well that was for your sculpture
          of the girl.  Your nude in the
          chair.

                    WALTER
          Carla -

Walter tries to arrange his thoughts -

                    WALTER
          I, uh, I've been alone for a
          long time, and I know you've
          been alone because you never
          seem to go out with anybody -

Walter looks nervously at his hands -

                    WALTER
           - even though Leonard's always
          asking you to go out with him and
          I - just -

                    CARLA
          What are you trying to say?

Walter gestures for Carla to sit down at a nearby bench -they sit 
down -

Walter swallows appearing very nervous -

                    WALTER
          Carla...
               (Beat)
          I don't want to make statues
          anymore!
                    CARLA
          You don't?

                    WALTER
          No.
               (Beat)
          I want to get married.
               (Beat)
          To you.

Carla senses trouble -

                    CARLA
          Uh...
               (Beat)
          ...how long have you been thinking
          about this, Walter?

                    WALTER
          Oh...f-for a long time.  Ever
          since you first came to the club.

Carla looks down at the ground -

                    WALTER
          You were the only one who was
          ever nice to me!
               (Beat)
          I didn't know you loved me
          until you kissed me.

Carla suddenly feels very awkward - she takes a deep breath and 
prepares for the rejection -

                    CARLA
          Walter, I really do like you.
          And I did kiss you.  But...
          that was because of your work.

Walter listens intently to every word -

                    CARLA
          There's more to being in love
          than just that.

Carla gives a sympathetic look to Walter - Walter doesn't react for 
a beat, as if putting two and two together -

                    WALTER
          You mean...you don't love me?
          
Carla looks down at the ground -

                    CARLA
          I'm afraid that's what I mean.

Walter begins to get very upset -

                    WALTER
          But you gotta love me!
               (Beat)
          Why do you think I made that
          statue of Alice?!

                    CARLA
          Walter, I'm sorry...
               
                    WALTER
          You just can't be sorry! I wanna -
          I wanna marry you!

Carla looks around -

                    CARLA
          Now calm down Walter!
               (Beat)
          Now, let's go in there, and
          when the show's over, maybe we
          can talk about it.

                    WALTER
          No! I want to talk about it now!

                    CARLA
          Walter...
               (Beat)
          I don't want to hurt your feelings
          but there is no way we're ever going
          to get...together.  You know what I
          mean?

                    WALTER
          Why not?!

                    CARLA
          Because...
               (Beat)
          We're just friends.  That's all.
          Just friends.
                    WALTER
          I get it.  I see the whole thing
          now. No one knows if Walter Paisley
          is born!

                    CARLA
          Jeez, what is your problem all of a
          sudden?

                    WALTER
          Oh sure, let's string along poor
          Walter, see how far it will take us!

Carla gets up -

                    CARLA
          You're starting to freak me out,
          Walter.  I'll see you there.

Carla heads off - Walter watches her leave -

                    WALTER
          You have to love me, Carla...

                                             DISSOLVE TO
INT JABBERJAW - NIGHT

The hoi polloi of the art community mingle at the private party -

On display are Walter's creations - Dead Cat, Murdered Man, 
Strangled Girl and his bust of the carpenter's head -

People talk about the works in muted voices, as if they are
serious works of art -

Art, the undercover cop, is also there, eyeing the room -

Maxwell takes an hors d'oeurve off a passing tray, and nods to 
someone offscreen -

Walter sits alone, dejected - a waitress presents him with a tray of 
champagne glasses -

Walter looks up at the tray -

                    WALTER
          No thanks.

The waitress walks away -

The plump man talks to an ART CRITIC -


                    CRITIC
          We have many artists about but
          no craftsmen.

The critic gestures to the voluptuous figure of Strangled Girl -
                    CRITIC
          This man knows his anatomy.

                    PLUMP MAN
          I'd give five thousand for
          this.

                    CRITIC
          After you've read my review it will
          probably cost you ten thousand.

The critic and the plump man laugh -

Maxwell swaggers over to Walter, putting his empty glass of 
champagne on a passing tray and grabbing up another -

He puts his hand on Walter's shoulder -

                    MAXWELL
          So what's the problem?

Leonard watches them from across the room -

                    MAXWELL
          Why on Earth should you be so
          depressed?  Have you heard some
          of the things they've been saying?
          You can make fifty thousand
          on these pieces alone!

                    WALTER
          I thought you didn't respect money!

                    MAXWELL
          I don't!  But fifty thou?  That's
          not money, that's manna!

Walter gets up -

                    WALTER
          Leave me alone.

Walter sees Carla -

He gets up and heads over to her -

Carla glares back at him  - Walter looks at her with a strange gaze 
in his eyes -

                    WALTER
          I'm sorry about what I said before.

                    CARLA
               (softening)
          Forget it.

                    WALTER
          I've been thinking...
               (Beat)
          Carla, would you do one favor
          for me?

                    CARLA
          Just about anything, Walter.

                    WALTER
          Would you let me make...a statue
          of you?
          
Carla smiles -

                    CARLA
          Would you really like to?  That
          would make me very happy.

                    WALTER
          Ok...tonight.  I'll make a
          statue of you tonight, OK?

Carla smiles and nods - then her smile fades -

Leonard takes a sip of champagne and notices something across the 
room -

Cuff and Link have crashed the party - they head over and take a 
look at Murdered Man -

Leonard puts his glass down and heads over to them -
               
Cuff takes his cigarette and jams it in the mouth of Murdered Man - 
Leonard approaches -

                    LINK
          Man, we've come to make the scene.

                    LEONARD
          You weren't invited.  Now get out
          of here.

                    CUFF
          I guess we're not good enough to get
          a private show.
                    LEONARD
          That's right!  And we're not open for
          business!  This is an art exhibit!  No
          bums!

Leonard pushes them out the door as Cuff grabs his cigarette back -
                    LINK          
          Man, you're the worst.

                    LEONARD
          Yeah right right - goodbye!

                    CUFF
          That's alright, we got a pressing
          engagement!

                    LINK
          Yeah, right outside the door!

Leonard closes the door behind them -

Carla is looking at the collection - she inspects Dead Cat, the 
carpenter's head -

She then approaches Strangled Girl - She smiles, drinking in the 
sculpture -

Then she sees something that troubles her -

                    CARLA
          Uh - oh.

She looks closely at one of the hands - a FRACTURE has formed on one 
of her fingers -

Carla gently goes to touch it when the piece CRACKS OFF -

Carla picks up the piece and goes to put it back -

She sees a HUMAN FINGER protruding from the sculpture -

Carla stands back, in shock -

She looks around the room - soon shock turns to horror -

She makes a bee-line for the front door but is stopped by Walter -

                    WALTER
          Where are you going Carla?
          Whatsamatter?

Carla is mute with terror for a beat, but manages to get out the 
words -

                    CARLA
          Walter...there's...
                    
                    WALTER
          What?

                    CARLA
          There's...a body inside that statue!

Walter smiles innocently -

                    WALTER
          Well, that's Alice.

Carla is speechless -

                    WALTER
          It's alright, Carla.
               (Beat)
          Maxwell said it's alright.

Walter takes a few steps closer -

                    WALTER
          Let them become clay in his hands
          so that he might mold them.

Carla is clearly frightened -

                    CARLA
          Walter...stay away from me!

                    WALTER
          Don't you see Carla?  I made them
          immortal.

Walter takes a few steps closer -

                    WALTER
          Don't you see?  I can do the
          same for you!

Carla waits for a second, then SHOVES Walter out of the way, fleeing 
out the door -

Walter looks around to see if anyone is looking -

Nobody is -

He takes this opportunity to BOLT out the door in pursuit of Carla -
EXT STREET - NIGHT

Carla runs down the street as fast as she can -

Walter follows, in hot pursuit -

INT JABBERJAW - NIGHT

The critic stands in front of Strangled Girl - Art approaches from 
behind -

The critic has noticed the EXPOSED finger -

                    CRITIC
          Well I'll be.  Look at this!

A WOMAN approaches -

                    CRITIC
          There's another work...inside this
          work.

                    WOMAN
          My Heavens!  It looks...like a real
          finger.

                    CRITIC
          It's unparalleled...reality cased in
          layers...concealed in a shield of
          whiteness, blankness...

Art scrutinizes the finger - several other people begin to approach, 
admiring the discovery -

                    ART
          Yeah...that's reality alright -

Art does not like what he sees -

Art heads over to murdered man -

He inspects the hand - sees a RING shape on one of the fingers -

A horrible realization forms in Art's mind - he grabs a BUTTER KNIFE 
off a table and begins to chip away at the
hand -

Maxwell sees this, begins to stumble over to it -

                    MAXWELL
          Precisely what are you doing!

Art breaks the plaster off the fingers - he inspects the ring on 
Lou's finger -

                    ART
          Lou...Lou!
               (Beat)
          Get back!

Everyone spins around as Art grabs a chair - SWINGS IT at Murdered 
Man -

There is a loud CRASH as Leonard watches Art hit the sculpture - the 
whole crowd then SCREAMS - the jig is up -

Carla continues to flee from Walter -

Walter appears to be gaining some ground -

Carla turns a corner -

                    CARLA
          Help!

Walter then follows her around the corner -

INT JABBERJAW - NIGHT

Art, Maxwell, and the critic run over to an ashen-faced Leonard -

                    ART

          here - I'm going to get Paisley!

Art, Maxwell and the critic burst out the front door - Cuff and Link 
see them -

                    CUFF
          Hey what's the deal!

                    MAXWELL

by some garbage cans -

him and runs away -

Walter throws the cans aside and continues to chase her -

Carla runs into the yard and hides behind a large stack of wood -

Walter then approaches, looks around, then suddenly -

Walter looks around -

Carla hides, but inadvertently KNOCKS OVER a piece of wood -

Walter hears it rattle across the ground - he runs toward the noise 
-

Carla grabs a bookshelf-sized PLANK as Walter approaches -

Walter freezes for a beat, a manic expression on his face -

                    CARLA
          Get back Walter...

Walter starts to approach -

                    CARLA
          Get back Walter!

Walter lunges and WHAM!  Carla slams the plank over Walter's head - 
he hits the ground -

Carla runs off in the direction she came from -

Walter staggers to his feet, clutching his head - he looks around, 
not knowing which direction Carla went - he runs in the opposite 
direction -

Walter runs down the street, stopping to catch his breath - he then 
continues to run down the street -

                    ART
          Are you alright?

                    CARLA
          Yeah - he's flipped out!

                    ART

He then looks toward his house, and runs to the gate -

EXT COURTYARD - NIGHT

Walter flies through the gate -

Mrs. Swicker approaches - Walter nearly CHECKS her into the wall -


                    MRS. SWICKER
          What in the name of -

Walter opens his door and slams it behind him -

INT WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT

Walter locks the door -

Walter looks around the room, panicking - he accidentally knocks 
Carla's picture to the ground -

                    WALTER
          What are you gonna do now Walter?

Walter looks in his closet -

Walter then looks up, as if getting an idea -

He begins to frantically barricade his door -

                                             DISSOLVE TO

                    ART
          Paisley!  Open the door!

INT WALTER'S ROOM  - NIGHT

Walter frantically mixes the plaster in the trough -

He looks back at the relentless banging at his door, and mixes the 
plaster with increased fury -

EXT COURTYARD - NIGHT

By this time a whole crowd of people have assembled at Walter's door 
- Art, Maxwell, and Leonard alternately kick and bash the door - the 
door begins to give -

                    ART
          Harder!

They continue to bash the door until finally -


INT WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT

CRASSHHHH!!! The door bursts open and Art, Maxwell, Leonard Carla, 
Cuff, Link and the critic all stumble in, pushing aside any 
obstacles -

Everyone begins to pour in but as they look ahead, there is a 
collective gasp -

They are looking at Walter, HANGING from a NOOSE, and covered in 
dripping plaster -

The crowd gathers around Walter in stunned silence -

Carla looks remorsefully at Walter -

                    CARLA
          Oh no...Walter...

                    CRITIC
          Unbelievable...this will command
          a small fortune.

                    MAXWELL
          I suppose he would have called it
          Hanging Man...
               (Beat)
          ...his greatest work.

PULL BACK to reveal the room of spectators, looking at Walter's 
final creation -


THE END
