<b>

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          FADE IN:
</b>
<b>          1 INT. HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT - 1978
</b>
          Close on a finger pressing the "record" button of a circa
          1970's tape recorder.

<b>          HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
</b>          This is Harvey Milk speaking on
          Friday November 18th. This is to be
          played only in the event of my
          death by assassination...
          REVEAL: HARVEY MILK, 48, sitting at his kitchen table in a
          cluttered San Francisco apartment.

<b>          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
</b>          During one of the early campaigns,
          I started opening my speeches with
          the same line and it sort of became
          my signature...

<b>          2 EXT. CITY HALL - NIGHT
</b>
          In street clothes, trying to corral an angry mob on City
          Hall's steps, Harvey lifts a bullhorn.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Hello, I'm Harvey Milk, and I'm
          here to recruit you.

<b>          3 INT. HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT
</b>
          Harvey at his kitchen table making his recording...

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          If I was speaking to a slightly
          hostile or mostly straight
          audience, I'd try to break the
          tension with a joke...

<b>          4 INT. UNION HALL - NIGHT
</b>
          Harvey is in a plain, ill fitting brown suit making a
          CAMPAIGN SPEECH to a crowd of stone faced UNION BOYS.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          I know, I know, I'm not what you
          were expecting, but I left my high
          heels at home.
          Harvey gets a LAUGH from the AUDIENCE.

<b>          
</b>
<b>

</b>
<b>          5 INT. HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT
</b>
          RETURN TO: Harvey speaking into his tape recorder.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          I fully realize that a person who
          stands for what I stand for - an
          activist, a gay activist - becomes
          the target or potential target for
          a person who is insecure,
          terrified, afraid or very disturbed
          themselves...

<b>          6 INT. CITY HALL OFFICES - MONTAGE - DAY
</b>
          POLICE OFFICERS AND PRESS RACE THROUGH THE HALLS of City
          Hall, their walkie-talkies squawking. Something terrible has
          happened. It's chaos.
          A STRETCHER IS WHEELED OUT OF AN OFFICE. On it, a FILLED BODY
          BAG with a WHITE SHEET draped over it.
          The press rush to get a shot. The police officers quickly
          load the body onto the elevator and disappear from sight.

<b>          9 EXT. S.F. CITY HALL / FRONT STEPS - DAY
</b>
          A shell shocked DIANNE FEINSTEIN, 45, wades into a throng of
          REPORTERS. Those surrounding her try to quiet the crowd.

<b>          DIANNE FEINSTEIN
</b>          As President of the Board of
          Supervisors, it's my duty to make
          this announcement. Both Mayor
          Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk
          have been shot... and killed.
          GASPS from the REPORTERS. Dianne struggles to be heard.

<b>          DIANNE FEINSTEIN (CONT'D)
</b>          Police are looking for a suspect...
          Supervisor Dan White.

<b>          10 INT. ST. MARY'S CATHEDRAL - DAY
</b>
          The very picture of loveliness, MARY-ANN WHITE, 28, finds her
          husband DAN WHITE, 31, sitting in the pews praying. He's a
          handsome, devout, all-American man in a three-piece suit.
          She sits by him. A weight hangs. He can't make eye contact.

<b>          DAN WHITE
</b>          Something has happened.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          3.
</b>          She puts her arm around him, feels a gun at his side. She
          holds him, firmly gripping the revolver in his holster, to
          conceal, to keep him from using it, potentially on himself.

<b>          11 INT. HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT
</b>
          RETURN TO: Harvey speaking into his tape recorder...

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Knowing that I could be assassinated
          at any moment, I feel it's important
          that some people should understand
          my thoughts. I think that--
          (pauses, not sure what to say)
          I wish I had time to explain
          everything I did. Almost everything
          that was done was done with an eye
          on the gay movement.

<b>          CUT TO BLACK:
</b>
<b>          CLEAN WHITE LETTERS ON A BLACK SCREEN READ â€œMILK"
</b>
<b>          13 INT. NEW YORK SUBWAY PLATFORM - NIGHT
</b>
           TITLE: "New York City. 1970."
          HARVEY, 40, is HEADING UP THE STAIRS from the subway
          platform. He is wearing a SUIT, but he's less than clean cut.
          His hair is brushing past his ears.
          HARVEY'S VERY INTERESTED POV: SCOTT SMITH, 22, a sexy curly
          haired hippie in tight jeans and boots, is HEADING DOWN THE
          THE STAIRS. Harvey tries to make eye contact.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Hey. I'm Harvey.

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          (so what?)
          Okay, Harvey...

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Today's my birthday.
          (Scott laughs)
          No, today is actually my birthday.
          Well, tonight. At midnight.

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          Really?

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          4.
</b>
<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          And, believe it or not, I don't
          have any plans. People took me out
          after work...

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          (looking him over)
          Work? So, that would be... Let me
          guess. Ma Bell or AT&amp;T.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          The Great American Insurance
          Company. I'm part of the big,
          evil, corporate establishment that,
          let me guess, you think is the
          cause of every evil thing in the
          world from Vietnam to diaper rash.

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          You left out bad breath.
          Falling for it, Harvey covers his mouth. Scott laughs. They
          both smile, realizing they share a wry sense of humor.
          A TRAIN IS COMING, Harvey has to work fast.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          So... You're not going to let me
          celebrate my birthday all by myself
          are you?

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          (gently teasing)
          Listen, Harvey, you're kind of cute
          for a suit... But I don't do guys
          over forty.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Well then, I'm in luck.

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          How's that?

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Because I'm still thirty-nine...
          (showing Scott his watch)
          And it's only eleven-fifteen.

<b>          14 INT. HARVEY'S NEW YORK APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
          IN A TIGHT TWO-SHOT, Scott is pressed against a wall with
          Harvey pressed against his back having sex. Harvey is the
          aggressor, completely uninhibited.

<b>          ISOLDE)
</b>
<b>          15 INT. HARVEY'S NEW YORK APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
          Harvey feeds Scott spoonfuls of CREAM PIE from a TRAY FULL of
          FOOD that rests on the bed between them. Ice cream, cookies,
          milk, berries... It's over the top and adorable.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Where are you from?

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          Jackson, Mississippi.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Well, this isn't Jackson, but you
          still can't respond to every
          strange man you meet on a subway
          platform. It's too dangerous.

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          Now you tell me.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          There's nothing tougher than a New
          York City cop. They're arrogant,
          and they're everywhere. I'll show
          you the cruising spots, if you
          want, if you promise you'll be
          careful... little Scottie-san.

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          Are you on uppers or what?

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          No. This is just... plain old me.

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          You're afraid of the cops?

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          I'm just discreet. I know a lot of
          people here. If they found out, I
          could lose my job.

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          (meaning a closet case)
          Oh. You're one of "those."
          (examines Harvey's eyes)
          I think you need a change of
          scenery. New friends.

</b>          I need a change.

<b>          SCOTT SMITH

          You're forty now.

<b>          HARVEY MILK

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          (laughs it off)
          No. Don't you worry. I won't make
          it to fifty.
          Scott distracts him, playful, like a newlywed at a wedding,
          he rubs a slice of pie in Harvey's face.
          Harvey reacts. Wipes the pie from his eye, and tackles his
          young, frisky new lover. They kiss. The mess getting
          everywhere. Harvey brushes it out of Scott's hair.

</b>          But by 1972, The Haight was boarded
          up. Crime-filled. Drug-filled. The
          new place for us refugees was this
          run down Irish Catholic
          neighborhood in Eureka Valley. Six
          blocks square... The Castro.

<b>          17 EXT. CASTRO STREET - DAY
</b>
          Harvey lifts a Nikon camera and starts SNAPPING PHOTOS of
          Castro Street.

<b>          WE SEE WHAT HARVEY SEES THROUGH THE LENS: A HARDWARE STORE,
</b>          a LIQUOR STORE, empty buildings, boarded windows...
          Harvey points the camera toward The MARQUEE of the Castro
          Theater, big letters spelling out... "C A S T R O..."
          Harvey points his camera across the street at the gray-
          haired, OWNER of a liquor store. Harvey snaps PHOTOS of his
          face, an expression of distrust.
          Harvey SNAPS a SIGN in the liquor shop window that reads:

<b>          "EUREKA VALLEY MERCHANTS SOCIETY."
</b>          Harvey's CAMERA focuses on TWO CUTE, YOUNG, HIPPIE BOYS
          WALKING PAST, one puts his arm over the other. To Harvey's
          eyes it's a very new site. It's overt. Thrilling.
          Harvey snaps a photo of an empty storefront with a FOR RENT
          SIGN hanging out front.

</b>          I suppose I can wait tables.

<b>          20 EXT. CASTRO STREET CAMERA SHOP - DAY (1973)
</b>
          Harvey's empty store front has been converted to a CAMERA
          STORE (with a few, not very impressive, products).
          Harvey is out on the sidewalk directing Scott who is inside
          the store's large window hanging a sign: "CASTRO CAMERA."

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Just a little to the left...
          The old liquor store owner from earlier, MCCONNELLY, crosses
          the street to watch. Harvey gives him a warm welcome:

<b>          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
</b>          Hello there. I'm Harvey Milk.

<b>          MCCONNELLY
</b>          You're the new renters?

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Yes. Welcome to Castro Camera.

</b>          Harvey extends his hand. McConnelly shakes, but is wary.

<b>          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
</b>          I want to join the, um... What is
          it? The Eureka Valley Merchant's
          Association. I want to help in any
          way possible. I'm no interloper.
          A Jew perhaps, but I hope you'll
          forgive that.
          McConnelly looks from Harvey to Scott in the window.

<b>          MCCONNELLY
</b>          I don't think your application will
          be approved, Mr. Milk. This is a
          family neighborhood. Your kind are
          far more welcome on Haight street.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          (trying to keep it friendly)
          What "kind" do you mean, sir?

<b>          MCCONNELLY
</b>          (not playing along)
          The Merchant's Association will
          have the police pull your license
          if you open your doors.

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          Based on what law?

<b>          MCCONNELLY
</b>          There's man's law and there's God's
          law in this neighborhood and in this
          City. The San Francisco Police
          force is happy to enforce either.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          (to McConnelly as he walks away)

          neighborhood!

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          We pay taxes you know!
          Harvey grabs Scott's hand... keeps him from heating up, from
          pouncing. It's not the time for them to bite yet.

</b>          One more minute!
          (back to his new scheme)
          I'll go to the neighborhood banks.
          They must have some gay customers.

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          Harvey. What's with all this
          political activist crap? I thought
          you were a goddamn Republican.
          Harvey walks into the small dining room holding two plates of
          food. He sets them out on a small dining room table, still
          rambling on to Scott in the bedroom.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          I'm a businessman, Scott. I think
          businesses ought to treat their
          customers right. Even their gay
          customers. For God's sake, this is
          San Francisco!

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          Harvey. It's just like every other
          city in this country. People hate
          us. Big surprise.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          We should have at least one block
          in one city right? Start there and
          take over the neighborhood.
          (a smile)
          Okay, you can come in now!
          Scott heads toward the kitchen. The table is LAID OUT with a
          home-cooked meal, CANDLES and a huge bouquet of FLOWERS.

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          Wow. This is--

          Scott chases Harvey around the apartment, trying to smear
          some of the CREAM PIE onto him.

<b>          22 EXT. THE CASTRO - DAY
</b>
          The street is shut down for the first ever Castro Street
          Fair. The crowd is mostly gay, the majority congregate
          outside Toad Hall bar.
          ANGLE ON: SOME OF THE OLD-SCHOOL, IRISH LOCALS milling about,
          eyeing the scene skeptically.
          Harvey MOVES THROUGH THE CROWD with Scott, shaking hands.

<b>          MAN ON THE STREET

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Thanks for joining the Castro
          Village Association!
          Harvey arrives at A LONG LINE OF GAY MEN winding out of the
          Irish liquor store (from earlier). He squeezes past them,
          into the store, leaving Scott outside.

<b>          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
</b>          Excuse me gentleman... ladies.
          (finding the shop owner)
          Hello! Mr. McConnelly!
          McConnelly, at the register, is overwhelmed with all the new
          business.

<b>          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
</b>          I just wanted to stop in and see
          how business was doing.

</b>          Fine.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          So you don't mind all these
          homosexuals in here, do you?
          McConnelly grins, uncomfortable. The line of gay men is
          curious about the hubbub. Point made, Harvey does a 180.

          Tell your wife Hello for me.
          Harvey spots Scott in the crowd and PULLS HIM TOWARD HIM,
          KISSING HIM ON THE MOUTH. It's quite the show. They step
          back out onto the street where an Irish band is now playing.
          Gay men watch. Some clap. Harvey grabs Scott and spins him
          through a sharp waltz. OFF the pair at home in their new
          neighborhood.

          home away from home...

          A FEW YOUNG MEN are hanging out in the shop, the beginnings
          of Harvey's entourage. Harvey moves among them, sharing a
          clipped Sunday cartoon, lecturing them on politics or the
          arts, and checking out the cute ones.

<b>          HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
</b>          There was Danny Niccoletta, a cute
          art student who I'd picked up at
          Toad Hall. Turns out he was also
          good at running the Camera Shop...
          something Scott and I found we had
          surprising little interest in...
          ON DANNY NICCOLETTA, young, waif-like, somewhat helpless.

<b>          DANNY NICCOLETTA
</b>          Opera is passe, Harvey. It's about
          street theater, now.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          What you're not getting is the
          spectacle of it, the bigger than
          life emotions...
          Danny jumps up and IMITATES the LARGER THAN LIFE GESTURES of
          an opera diva, making Harvey laugh.

          JIM RIVALDO flops down into the vintage dental chair that
          sits in front of Harvey's desk. He seems to be looking for
          something to occupy his keen mind. A sharply dressed young
          man, 20s, DICK PABICH, walks up to peek over his shoulder.

<b>          HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          And somewhere along the line Jim
          picked up a protege, a cute

          Pabich... And of course there was
          Dennis Peron, who ran a very popular
          business with the new kids...
          DENNIS PERON hands Scott a FREE JOINT.

          ACROSS THE ROOM, Scott is waiting on a CUSTOMER, he's out of
          place: straight, gruff, a union man, ALLAN BAIRD, 40s.

</b>          The Mayor part. I've considered
          gathering an army of queers to
          march up to City Hall and secede,
          but so far the young gays seem more
          interested in jeeps and jeans. But
          if I could be of any use, I'm all
          ears!

<b>          ALLAN BAIRD
</b>          We can't get Coors to go union.
          These guys are like me, they can't
          be out of work too long.
          Harvey pulls Allan aside, away from the audience, easing his
          nerves. It's Harvey at his best.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          I'm just curious. Are we your first
          stop or your last?

<b>          ALLAN BAIRD
</b>          (clearly his last)
          It's been a tough one, Mr. Milk.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Well, you seem to have noticed that
          my kind of people drink a lot of
          beer. If we're going to fast for
          your sake, I think we should get to
          deliver some of it when you win

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          And allies. I'll have Coors out of

          of all the Gay Bars. 30 million
          bottles worth in San Francisco
          alone. Coors beer immediately fell
          from number 1. They caved. One week
          later, union man Allan Baird hired
          the first ever openly gay union
          boys to drive Teamsters trucks...
          We weren't just a group of pansies
          anymore. We had a neighborhood. We
          had the unions. And for the first
          time, we had a little bit of power.

          Some of the GAY MEN move out of the COPS' way but some of

          Harvey, Scott and the OTHERS try to break into the crowd, to
          get closer to the fight. To pull the cops off their friends.
          Danny HANGS BACK, snapping PHOTOS of the event.

          Harvey sets his box down right beside a SFPD OFFICER. It

          citywide office. Political alliances
          need to be built. You can't simply
          move here from across the country
          and run for office.

</b>          But I am running for office. I'm on
          the ballot. I have the union rank

</b>          Harvey, we're like the Catholic
          church. We welcome converts, but we
          don't make them Pope the same day.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          And why haven't you run?

<b>          DAVID GOODSTEIN
</b>          It's too early for a gay candidate
          for Supervisor. Especially one
          from the Castro. It's bad for the
          community's image.
          Scott climbs out of the pool and sits at the table, naked and
          sopping wet.

</b>          What's wrong with the Castro?

</b>          Nobody works there. It's all sex
          and drugs and more sex and no one
          taking responsibility for their own
          problems.

</b>          There are no real gay allies. Yes,

          JUMP TO: Harvey steps out of a dressing room in a brown suit.
          His hair is cut short, his face is shaven clean. It's quite a
          transformation. Scott and the old owner, LILY, size him up.

          PAN OFF: a large "RICK STOKES, SUPERVISOR DISTRICT 5" poster
          to reveal Anne Kronenberg outside the hall handing "MILK"
          signs to a long line of gathering women and lesbians who are
          filing in.
          Flanked by a PEEVED AID, Rick Stokes rushes out of the
          lecture hall and confronts Anne.

<b>          RICK STOKES
</b>          Young lady, you must be confused.
          This is my night, not Mr. Milk's.

<b>          ANNE KRONENBERG
</b>          (as pleasant as can be)
          No, sir. I'm Harvey's new campaign
          manager. Anne Kronenberg.

<b>          RICK STOKES
</b>          Then you should know this race is
          for District 5, the Castro, not for
          all of your lesbian... compadres--
          A tough lesbian kisses Anne and stares Rick down as she heads
          in. Rick looks uncomfortable around all these women.

<b>          ANNE KRONENBERG
</b>          I'm sorry. Are we distracting you,

          Dick runs up looking for more fliers. Taking Rick even more
          off his game, Dick is flirtatious.

          on Valencia Street. Living right
          there in our district. And you see,

          Dozens of supporters hold "MILK for Supervisor" signs in a
          long line along Market St. waving to commuters. Anne walks
          the long line, handing out new signs to arriving volunteers.
          Harvey is handing out FLYERS. He is exhausted, his throat is
          RAW. The campaign is nearly over.
          A WEIRD MOMENT: A BOY walks up to Harvey and hands him a
          flier. ALL SOUND GOES DEAD ON THE SOUNDTRACK as HARVEY'S EYES
          lock into the BOY'S EYES.
          Harvey reads the FLIER: â€œUnite and Fight for Dan White.â€�
          Harvey looks back to pat the BOY'S head, but he's gone. He
          looks to the sidewalk for the kid... a parent... nothing...

          Harvey is still looking at the flier. Anne is leaving with a
          stack of SF Chronicles. Cleve comes in, pulls one off her
          stack, and looks for "the article."

          Cleve goes. His energy is boundless. Harvey sits alone
          watching the bargoers return home through his front window. A
          bitter-sweetness lingers. A couple waves, one shouts out:

</b>          Gonna win this time, Milk?
          They walk on, not waiting for an answer.
          Then, a drunk, cute, Latino, JACK LIRA, 25, stops. He stares
          in at the political ads in the window. Harvey watches him
          sway drunk out of his mind, waiting for him to fall. The two
          make eye contact. Harvey smiles. Jack tries to. Harvey picks
          up a folding chair and walks it out to him.

          Jack smiles, out of his mind. Then he sits/falls down into
          the chair, and slides off. Harvey stands above the passed out
          young man. A newcomer. A wounded bird. Perfect.

          Completely nude, Jack plays a tantalizing game of seduction,
          allowing Harvey to hold him, then wriggling away... Dancing
          against Harvey then BITING his shoulder... LYING on the bed,
          then ROLLING away when Harvey tries to hold him...
          No TALK. No POLITICS. Just SEX. A perfect RELEASE for

          filled. This is not the rundown Castro that Harvey moved
          into 3 years ago.
          Harvey heads home, greeted by his PROUD CONSTITUENTS.
          He stops at the CAMERA SHOP when he notices a BROKEN WINDOW
          near the side entrance to his apartment.

          Harvey RUSHES UP THE STAIRS into his apartment and finds:
          JACK LIRA - Lighting a candle on the table which has been set
          for a lovely, romantic dinner.

<b>          HARVEY
</b>          Jack?

<b>          JACK LIRA
</b>          Welcome home, Harvey! I hope you're
          hungry. I only know how to cook one
          thing, but I make it good.

<b>          HARVEY
</b>          Did you... break in?

<b>          JACK LIRA
</b>          I asked the boy downstairs to let
          me in...

<b>          JACK LIRA
</b>          He wouldn't let me in. So I came in
          this way. Your friends aren't very
          nice to me.

<b>          HARVEY
</b>          (avoiding the fight)
          I have a Town Hall meeting tonight,
          Jack.

<b>          JACK LIRA
</b>          You work too hard. I'm sorry about
          your window. I'll fix it tomorrow.
          (turning on the charm)
          Are you surprised?!

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Jack, I have to go. I have an
          invitation to a party tomorrow.
          Lots of rich people, politicians.
          We could get all dressed up...
          Jack turns up the music, takes Harvey's hands and guides him
          through a simple dance.

<b>          JACK LIRA
</b>          So I could be the first lady?

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Uh-huh.

<b>          JACK LIRA
</b>          I watched TV here today. All day. I
          saw All My Children. They killed
          Margo. I knew it was going to
          happen. They try and trick you but
          it never works.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          (enjoying this)
          You always see it coming?

<b>          JACK LIRA
</b>          What? Killing the blonde? Every
          time. I'm good with that.
          (gets slow, sensual)
          I think now the old lady is going
          to have an affair. Then she'll get
          killed or married. Always one or
          the other. Dead or married.
          Jack starts dancing with Harvey again. It's sweet, intimate.

<b>          JACK LIRA
</b>          That's right.
          The dance lesson is a lovely distraction. Harvey won't be
          going back to work tonight.

<b>          86 INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - DAY

          Harvey watches water pour over an INFANT BOY. He tries hard
          to feel comfortable, but he's the only Jew, and likely the
          only gay man at Dan's child's baptism.
          Dan looks to Harvey, the proud father. Harvey waves.

<b>          87 INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - LATER
</b>
          Harvey and Dan have pulled themselves away.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          I'm proposing a citywide ordinance.
          It ensures that a person who
          already has a job can't be fired
          for their orientation.

</b>          I'm not sure my constituents would
          favor that.
          Dan looks over to his WIFE and NEWBORN SON.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Is anyone else here from the Board?

<b>          DAN WHITE
</b>          You're the only one who showed up I
          think.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Were you christened here?

<b>          DAN WHITE
</b>          Yes. Right here. Same Parish. My
          grandma immigrated here when this
          was an Irish Catholic city. The
          City of St. Francis... A lot's
          changed here since then.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Do you know a lot of "homosexuals?"

<b>          DAN WHITE
</b>          (smiles, then)
          Say, where do you stand on the

          pushing into my district?

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Well, I'd have to study it...

<b>          DAN WHITE
</b>          Getting it out of my district was a
          key piece of my platform. It only
          attracts arsonist, rapists, all
          that, you know.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Sure, sure. A campaign promise.

<b>          DAN WHITE
</b>          A big one.

</b>          What do you say we watch out for each
          other's interests? I'd like that.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          I'd like that, too, Dan.
          Mary Ann White approaches with their child. It's awkward, as
          if she's walked in on something intimate.

<b>          DAN WHITE
</b>          I'm sorry. Slipped into some shop
          talk.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          The Gay Rights Ordinance. My fault.

</b>          Supervisors Silver and Lau are

<b>          MICHAEL WONG
</b>          It's a Youth Campus, Harvey. These

          in California for sure. He's filed
          his petition for a statewide
          referendum to fire all gay teachers
          and anyone who supports them.
          A pall falls over the room. This is worse than expected.

</b>          How many signatures will he need to
          qualify for the ballot?

          In the crowd is teacher TOM AMMIANO, 36, colorful, worked up:

</b>          And how are you going to determine
          who's a homosexual?

<b>          JOHN BRIGGS

</b>          Sir, you can argue with me, but you
          cannot argue with God.
          It's getting ugly fast. Briggs is whisked away by TWO

</b>          But we can't afford infighting

</b>          Across the country, a handful of
          city councils had passed the very
          first ordinances protecting gay
          people against discrimination. But
          Anita Bryant and her right wing
          Christian fundamentalists were
          creating and exploiting and fanning
          a backlash. Now she had referenda
          to repeal all of these gay rights
          ordinances. While we were preparing

          Cleve searches frantically for something... He SEES a pile of
          DOG POOP. He scoops it up and runs it back to City Hall's
          front lawn and plants it in the grass.

<b>          105 EXT. CITY HALL / FRONT LAWN - MOMENTS LATER

          IN THE VERY SAME SPOT CLEVE JUST WAS: Harvey with a clump of
          REPORTERS, a red and white "No on 6" button pinned to his
          lapel (HENCEFORTH, IT'S A FIXTURE).

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Dog mess is a hazard, and on top of
          that, it's disgusting. Under the

          clean up can be fined. This really
          is the bottom line!
          He smiles at his own joke, punctuating it by "accidentally"
          stepping in Cleve's well-placed dog shit. A BIG grin. BULBS

          leave him confused and tongue tied.

          must come out. Come out to your
          parents. I know that it is hard and
          will hurt them but think about how
          they will hurt you in the voting
          booth! Come out to your friends, if
          they indeed are your friends. Come
          out to your neighbors, to your
          fellow workers. Once and for all,
          break down the myths, destroy the
          lies and distortions. For your sake.
          For their sake. For the sake of the

          Finally face to face, Harvey extends his hand. Its a show for
          the FLASHING CAMERAS. Briggs is clearly uncomfortable.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Hi, I'm Harvey Milk. It's quite an
          honor to meet you, Mr. Briggs.

<b>          JOHN BRIGGS
</b>          I'm aware. Sad you're too afraid to
          fight this out in public, Mr. Milk.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          No sir. I would love to have a
          public debate. I'm very interested
          in the details of your argument.

<b>          JOHN BRIGGS
</b>          You know the details. As do the
          people. Look at the votes across this
          nation. The "public" is with me.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Yes sir, today they are. But with my
          City's Mayor and the San Francisco
          press as my witnesses, I'm
          challenging you to a public debate.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Senator, as a Christian it's
          interesting that you don't seem to
          understand what Christ was about.
          He was about accepting people and
          giving love, not carrying a Bible

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          That's it. In your mind they
          haven't, and I'm wondering why--

<b>          JOHN BRIGGS
</b>          Mr. Milk, we don't allow people who
          believe in practicing bestiality to
          teach our children, and the reason
          we don't is because it is illegal.
          But it's not illegal to be a
          homosexual in California.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          And your law goes even further. Any
          school employee who even supports a
          gay person will be fired--

<b>          JOHN BRIGGS
</b>          True. But, gay people don't have
          children of their own. If they
          don't recruit our children, they'd
          all die away. That's why they want
          to be teachers, to encourage our
          children to join them.

<b>          HARVEY MILK (ON TV)
</b>          How do you teach homosexuality?
          Like French? I was born of
          heterosexual parents, I was taught
          by heterosexual teachers in a
          fiercely heterosexual society. So
          then why am I homosexual? And no

</b>          If they're going to lead such an
          open life of homosexuality that
          they want a 21-gun salute every

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          We were really genuinely frightened
          by Proposition Six, and with the
          backlash gaining strength, we were
          very pessimistic. We didn't think
          there was any chance we could beat
          it. What we hoped to do was to
          organize to the point that when we
          did lose, there would be a

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          If in your statements here you say
          that child molestation is not an

</b>          Same thing with VD Harvey, we put
          out publications about VD so you
          can avoid it.

<b>          HARVEY MILK

          But you've even admitted that
          there's more molestation in the
          heterosexual group! So why not get
          rid of the heterosexual teachers?
          Boos from the conservative audience.

<b>          JOHN BRIGGS
</b>          We are not talking about homos...
          child molestation, the fact is, at
          least 95 percent of the people are
          heterosexual. If we took
          heterosexuals out AND homosexuals
          out, you know what--

          you stop?

          Still made up from head to toe as a clown, Harvey walks the
          streets of San Francisco. He waves, smiles, poses for photos
          with tourists. It's a rare moment of grace. He jumps on a
          trolley headed toward Castro. He instantly captures the
          imagination of a small GIRL wearing a knit hat.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          (re: their hats)
          Would you like to trade with me?

<b>          GIRL
</b>          No. What the heck are you?

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Oh, me? I'm an elected official. I
          run this city.

</b>          He makes a show of it. She smiles. He hands her the flower
          he's been holding onto all afternoon.

<b>          130 INT. "NO ON SIX" CENTER / MARKET STREET - NIGHT
</b>
          THIS IS THE MOMENT. Harvey watches aides on the phones comb
          districts for voting results. Jim fills up a map on the wall.

<b>          DICK PABICH
</b>          San Bernadino is coming in. Not
          good.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Of course not. How not good?

<b>          MICHAEL WONG
</b>          60% for Briggs. Same in Fresno.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Dear God, little Lotus Blossom.
          Harvey is stunned. Other districts follow with similar
          results. They go up in red on the map.

<b>          JIM RIVALDO
</b>          Imperial is 69% "for" so far.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Put it up on the board.
          Harvey tries to stomach this major defeat, loss after loss.
          He starts reflexively tying his tie in a knot. Cleve comes up
          to Harvey, concerned.

<b>          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
</b>          The whole world is watching this.
          This is San Francisco we're about
          to lose. Are you ready?

<b>          CLEVE JONES
</b>          I can have 15,000 people in an
          hour. But there's gonna be riots if
          this thing passes.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          (darkens, pointed)
          There goddamn better be.

          official, but for God's sake, if
          this thing passes, fight back.
          Cleve is stunned, holding the weight of Harvey's words.
          Harvey's focus is interrupted when Anne brings him the phone.

          Kind of a bad time, Don.

<b>          YOUNG TEEN (V.O.)
</b>          No sir, this is Paul. Don just gave
          me the phone.

</b>          Paul who?

<b>          YOUNG TEEN (V.O.)
</b>          You talked to me on the phone a
          year or so ago. I'm from

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          (a beat to take it in, then:)
          I thought you were a goner, Paul.

<b>          YOUNG TEEN
</b>          I'm sorry. I should have called.
          When I read in the paper that you
          won the Supervisor seat, I got a
          friend to put me on a bus to LA.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Who did you know in Los Angeles?

<b>          YOUNG TEEN
</b>          Nobody. That's the uh... I just
          didn't want to die anymore, sir.
          (Harvey's at a loss for words)
          I met your friend Don down here. I
          turned 18. I voted today against
          Prop Six... Thank you, Mr. Milk.

<b>          HARVEY MILK

</b>          Then you have to see San Francisco!

<b>          YOUNG TEEN
</b>          Okay. I will. Don wanted me to

          tonight. Congratulations Mr. Milk.
          Harvey turns back to the map. Jim Rivaldo is now coloring in
          LA county with green. On the other end of the phone, Harvey's
          friend in LA, Don Amador, is back on the line.

<b>          DON AMADOR (V.O.)
</b>          It looks like we've taken LA
          County, Harvey. By 65%. It's huge.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          I gotta go, Don. Thank you.
          (frantic, to the room)
          LA by 65% put it up! Put it up!
          The tone in the room is changing. Jim storms up.

<b>          JIM RIVALDO
</b>          The polls were off. Briggs is going
          down by more than 2 to 1. The only
          district where it's leading in San
          Francisco is Dan White's.
          Harvey takes a moment to absorb the map. Anne, Dick &amp; Jim,
          all the volunteers. What this apparent win means to him, to
          his people. To Cleve:

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Well crap Cleve, now what are we
          going to do tonight?!
          (re: a giant, jock strap

          will be coming our way.

<b>          131 INT. "NO ON SIX" CENTER / MARKET STREET - LATER
</b>
          TV cameras roll. Lady liberty is covered with a "No on Six"
          poster. A brass band marches dramatically into the hall.
          Balloons fall. Harvey MOUNTS the stage to INCREDIBLE CHEERS.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          To the gay community all over this
          state... my message to you is... so
          far a lot of people joined us and
          rejected Proposition Six, and now we
          owe them something... We must destroy
          the myths once and for all, shatter
          them. We must continue to speak
          out... and most importantly, most
          importantly, every gay person must
          come out.

<b>          (CHEERS)
</b>          Tonight... Tonight it is clear that
          everyone out there does know one of
          us. And now that they do, they see
          we are not sick... they can feel we
          are not wrong... and they know we
          should have a place in this great
          country and in this world... A
          message of hope has been to sent to
          all the young people out there...
          to all those afraid of this wave of
          hate... to all those who have lost
          their homes and their hometowns...
          tonight we know there is a place
          for us! My brothers and sisters...
          we can come home again!
          The crowd goes WILD. Harvey BEAMS. Moscone walks up onto
          stage and lifts Harvey's hand. Harvey is now a member of the
          S.F. political elite. Cleve watches from afar as Harvey steps
          off and disappears into the crowd.

          The party behind him, Harvey scans the block. Cleve catches
          up, looking at Harvey, probing:

<b>          CLEVE JONES
</b>          What's the matter?

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          You ever heard of sore losers? Well,

</b>          I think maybe we're best with our
          backs to the wall. It's too quiet.
          (a new idea, what's next)
          I think we should march on
          Washington D.C. next year.

<b>          CLEVE JONES
</b>          Milk, you're a decent politician, a
          mediocre businessman, but you're a
          lousy gay man.
          (Harvey knows what he's
          getting at)
          Take some time off. Fifty's right
          around the corner.
          (a devilish grin)
          Nobody will want you after that...
          I can handle D.C.

<b>          HARVEY MILK

          The people voted for us, Cleve Jones.

<b>          CLEVE JONES
</b>          They did. There's nowhere to march
          tonight, Mr. Harvey Milk. Lets go
          back inside.
          Turning back, they savor the moment, like father and son
          walking to Castro Camera, growing ever smaller in the frame.

<b>          134 INT. CITY HALL / SUPERVISORS' OFFICES - DAY
</b>
          Dan White slides a sealed letter across a desk to an Aide.
          It's addressed to Moscone. He seems oddly calm.

<b>          DAN WHITE
</b>          Could you give this to the Mayor
          for me? As soon as possible.

<b>          135 INT. CITY HALL / SUPERVISORS' OFFICES - DAY
</b>
          Harvey walks down the hallway to his office, a spring in his
          step. There are nods, hellos if not outright deference from
          most passersby. His newfound political muscle is evident.
          He comes face to face with Dan White.

          Harvey doesn't know what to say. Dan's right, it does make
          him happy. But it's not that simple.

<b>          DAN WHITE (CONT'D)
</b>          You'll be the next President of the

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          I'm sure we could work together--
          Dan walks away from Harvey. He doesn't want to hear anything
          Harvey has to say.
          Harvey watches as Dan is met in the hallway by an OFFICER
          from the POLICE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION.

<b>          OFFICER
</b>          Hey, Dan. Just got word. Can we
          talk to you for a minute?

          Dan heads for his office.

</b>          Downstairs. The Association
          meeting room...
          Harvey watches as Dan follows the officer down the stairs to
          an ASSOCIATION MEETING ROOM on the next floor. When the DOOR
          OPENS, Harvey sees SEVERAL REPRESENTATIVES from the Police
          Department wearing somber expressions.
          It looks as if Dan is about to get REAMED OUT.

          looks up, seeing Harvey in his office window.
          They make eye contact. It bears all the awkwardness of a
          relationship lost.

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          Yes. I'd go with you.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          I'd like that.
          Harvey is quiet, a rare moment of reflection. An unexpected
          tear rolls down his cheek.

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          Harvey?

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Look out the window, the sun's
          coming up.

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          It's late. You should get some
          sleep.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          I don't want to miss it.

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          Miss what?

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          This.
          Harvey's single word answer means, "Life."
          OFF Harvey: Neither wants to hang up the phone.

<b>          144 INT. DAN WHITE'S HOME / LIVING ROOM - MORNING
</b>
          The sun rising in his own living room, Dan White has been up
          all night, too. The coffee table is covered with coke cans
          and junk food wrappers.

<b>          145 INT. CITY HALL - DAY
</b>
          Waiting for a MAN inside to turn away, Dan sneaks in through
          a side window at City Hall. The man calls after him:

<b>          MAN
</b>          Hey, wait a minute, Mr.--

<b>          DAN WHITE
</b>          My aide was supposed to come down
          here and let me in the side door,
          but she never showed up.

<b>          MAN
</b>          And you are?

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          100.
</b>
<b>          DAN WHITE
</b>          I'm Dan White. City Supervisor.
          We follow Dan down the hall and into the grand entry-way.

<b>          146 INT. CITY HALL / METAL DETECTORS - SAME
</b>
          Harvey walks through City Hall's METAL DETECTORS. He picks up
          his keys from the dish and heads up the grand staircase. Like
          ships in the night, Harvey just misses Dan exiting the
          elevator. Dan heads into Mayor Moscone's office.

<b>          147 INT. CITY HALL / SUPERVISORS' CHAMBERS - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
          With Dianne, Harvey is thrilled, rubbing it in.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Who's it gonna be? Is he replacing
          Dan with that God Damned liberal
          lefty Don Horanzy? That'll really
          shake up the Board, huh?

<b>          DIANNE FEINSTEIN
</b>          All I know is that we're getting a
          new Supervisor today. If Dan shows
          up, just avoid him. We don't need
          a scene today, right Harvey?

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          (grins ear to ear)
          Heaven forbid, Dianne.

<b>          148 INT. CITY HALL / MAYOR MOSCONE'S WAITING ROOM - SAME
</b>
          The MAYOR'S SECRETARY sits at her desk. Shouting can be heard
          from inside his office.

<b>          149 INT. CITY HALL / MAYOR MOSCONE'S OFFICE - SAME
</b>
          Moscone leads Dan White to the bar beside his office. Dan is
          enraged. Moscone lights a cigarette.

<b>          DAN WHITE
</b>          You can't take this away from me!
          Moscone has his back turned, pouring them cocktails.

<b>          MAYOR MOSCONE
</b>          The issue is what's fair, for the
          people of your district. Take some
          time off. Spend it with your
          family.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          101.
</b>          Moscone finishes pouring two cocktails, and turns to see Dan
          White brandishing his revolver.

<b>          150 INT. CITY HALL / MAYOR MOSCONE'S WAITING ROOM - SAME
</b>
          Moscone's Secretary, and a WAITING MAN note the THREE DULL
          THUDS, not so different than a backfire. The secretary looks
          out the window, concerned. The waiting man checks his watch.

<b>          151 INT. CITY HALL / MAYOR MOSCONE'S OFFICE - SAME
</b>
          Still gripped in his hand, Moscone's cigarette burns a hole
          in his tie.

<b>          152 INT. CITY HALL / SUPERVISORS' OFFICES - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
          Dan walks past Dick Pabich, past Dianne's office. Harvey's
          voice can be heard down the hall. He sounds up-beat,

<b>          OPTIMISTIC:
</b>
<b>          HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
</b>          This time next year we're marching
          on Washington D.C. It'll look like
          Market and Castro, but with a
          million people. Write that down.
          Tell President Carter we're coming
          after him next. I'm going to
          deposit this. I'll be back in 20
          minutes.
          Dan arrives at Harvey's office door. Harvey is with a FRIEND,
          preparing to leave, surprised to see Dan in his doorway.

<b>          DAN WHITE
</b>          Say, Harve, can I see you for a
          minute?

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Sure.
          Dan walks Harvey down the hall to his old office.

<b>          153 INT. CITY HALL / DAN WHITE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
          Harvey walks in first. Dan stays between Harvey and the door.
          Dan closes it. Harvey smiles, sensing something is off.
          Dan draws his revolver. Harvey raises his hand. Dan Fires.
          The bullet rips through Harvey's hand and down his arm.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Oh no... N--
          Dan Fires again, silencing Harvey's cry for help.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          102.
</b>          Harvey turns away. Another bullet rips into his chest, and he
          falls to his knees, now facing the window. He staggers toward
          it. The moment is extended as we see Harvey's POV of the
          Opera House outside the window, and the Castro beyond it.
          HOLD ON HARVEY, gazing out at his beloved city.
          Dan puts his revolver to the back of Harvey's head. HE FIRES.
          And just like that, Harvey falls.

<b>          HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          Last week I got a phone call--

<b>          156 INT. FLASH BACK - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL
</b>
           Harvey is still speaking into the tape recorder...

<b>           HARVEY
</b>          --from Altoona, Pennsylvania, and
          the voice was quite young, and the
          person said... "Thanks." You've got
          to elect gay people so that that
          young child and the thousands upon
          thousand like him know there's
          hope... hope for a better world...

<b>          157 INT. MEMORIAL SERVICE / SAN FRANCISCO - EARLY EVENING
</b>
          Scott and Anne enter a sparsely attended memorial service.
          Most of the seats are empty. The speaker is unfamiliar, some
          appointed CITY OFFICIAL.

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          (finally crumbling, tears roll)
          Where is everybody? Didn't anyone
          give a damn?

<b>          158 INT. FLASH BACK - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL
</b>
          Harvey speaking into the tape recorder.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          I ask this... If there should be an
          assassination, I would hope that
          five, ten, one hundred, a thousand
          would rise. I would like to see
          every gay lawyer, every gay
          architect come out--

<b>          159 EXT. MEMORIAL SERVICE 1978 - CONTINUOUS
</b>
          Walking back out onto the street, Anne and Scott turn to look
          down Market Street, the camera pans and drifts to reveal:

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          103.
</b>
<b>          A MASSIVE CANDLELIGHT MARCH. CLEVE JONES LEADS TENS OF
</b>          THOUSANDS of San Franciscans of every religion, nationality,
          sexuality, all of the familiar faces and many new ones...
          THEY ALL MARCH SILENTLY up Market Street to the palace Harvey
          dreamed could be his own: City Hall.

<b>          HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
</b>          --If a bullet should enter my
          brain, let that bullet destroy
          every closet door... And that's
          all. I ask for the movement to
          continue. Because it's not about
          personal gain, not about ego, not
          about power... it's about the
          "us's" out there. Not only gays,
          but the Blacks, the Asians, the
          disabled, the seniors, the us's.
          Without hope, the us's give up--
          As the thousands of mourners arrive at City Hall, they place
          their candles around the statue of Lincoln.

<b>          HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          --I know you cannot live on hope
          alone, but without it, life is not
          worth living. So you, and you, and
          you...

<b>          159B INT. FLASHBACK - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT
</b>

<b>           HARVEY MILK
</b>          You gotta give em' hope... you
          gotta give em' hope.
          Harvey closes his note pad, puts down his pencil, and pushes
          stop on his recorder.

<b>          160 EXT. CASTRO CAMERA - NIGHT
