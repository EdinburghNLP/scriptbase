          FADE IN:

          1 INT. HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT - 1978

          Close on a finger pressing the "record" button of a circa
          1970's tape recorder.

          HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
          This is Harvey Milk speaking on
          Friday November 18th. This is to be
          played only in the event of my
          death by assassination...
          REVEAL: HARVEY MILK, 48, sitting at his kitchen table in a
          cluttered San Francisco apartment.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          During one of the early campaigns,
          I started opening my speeches with
          the same line and it sort of became
          my signature...

          2 EXT. CITY HALL - NIGHT

          In street clothes, trying to corral an angry mob on City
          Hall's steps, Harvey lifts a bullhorn.

          HARVEY MILK
          Hello, I'm Harvey Milk, and I'm
          here to recruit you.

          3 INT. HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT

          Harvey at his kitchen table making his recording...

          HARVEY MILK
          If I was speaking to a slightly
          hostile or mostly straight
          audience, I'd try to break the
          tension with a joke...

          4 INT. UNION HALL - NIGHT

          Harvey is in a plain, ill fitting brown suit making a
          CAMPAIGN SPEECH to a crowd of stone faced UNION BOYS.

          HARVEY MILK
          I know, I know, I'm not what you
          were expecting, but I left my high
          heels at home.
          Harvey gets a LAUGH from the AUDIENCE.

          5 INT. HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT

          RETURN TO: Harvey speaking into his tape recorder.

          HARVEY MILK
          I fully realize that a person who
          stands for what I stand for - an
          activist, a gay activist - becomes
          the target or potential target for
          a person who is insecure,
          terrified, afraid or very disturbed
          themselves...

          6 INT. CITY HALL OFFICES - MONTAGE - DAY

          POLICE OFFICERS AND PRESS RACE THROUGH THE HALLS of City
          Hall, their walkie-talkies squawking. Something terrible has
          happened. It's chaos.
          A STRETCHER IS WHEELED OUT OF AN OFFICE. On it, a FILLED BODY
          BAG with a WHITE SHEET draped over it.
          The press rush to get a shot. The police officers quickly
          load the body onto the elevator and disappear from sight.

          9 EXT. S.F. CITY HALL / FRONT STEPS - DAY

          A shell shocked DIANNE FEINSTEIN, 45, wades into a throng of
          REPORTERS. Those surrounding her try to quiet the crowd.

          DIANNE FEINSTEIN
          As President of the Board of
          Supervisors, it's my duty to make
          this announcement. Both Mayor
          Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk
          have been shot... and killed.
          GASPS from the REPORTERS. Dianne struggles to be heard.

          DIANNE FEINSTEIN (CONT'D)
          Police are looking for a suspect...
          Supervisor Dan White.

          10 INT. ST. MARY'S CATHEDRAL - DAY

          The very picture of loveliness, MARY-ANN WHITE, 28, finds her
          husband DAN WHITE, 31, sitting in the pews praying. He's a
          handsome, devout, all-American man in a three-piece suit.
          She sits by him. A weight hangs. He can't make eye contact.

          DAN WHITE
          Something has happened.

          

          

          

          

          3.
          She puts her arm around him, feels a gun at his side. She
          holds him, firmly gripping the revolver in his holster, to
          conceal, to keep him from using it, potentially on himself.

          11 INT. HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT

          RETURN TO: Harvey speaking into his tape recorder...

          HARVEY MILK
          Knowing that I could be assassinated
          at any moment, I feel it's important
          that some people should understand
          my thoughts. I think that--
          (pauses, not sure what to say)
          I wish I had time to explain
          everything I did. Almost everything
          that was done was done with an eye
          on the gay movement.

          CLEAN WHITE LETTERS ON A BLACK SCREEN READ â€œMILK"

          13 INT. NEW YORK SUBWAY PLATFORM - NIGHT

           TITLE: "New York City. 1970."
          HARVEY, 40, is HEADING UP THE STAIRS from the subway
          platform. He is wearing a SUIT, but he's less than clean cut.
          His hair is brushing past his ears.
          HARVEY'S VERY INTERESTED POV: SCOTT SMITH, 22, a sexy curly
          haired hippie in tight jeans and boots, is HEADING DOWN THE
          THE STAIRS. Harvey tries to make eye contact.

          HARVEY MILK
          Hey. I'm Harvey.

          SCOTT SMITH
          (so what?)
          Okay, Harvey...

          HARVEY MILK
          Today's my birthday.
          (Scott laughs)
          No, today is actually my birthday.
          Well, tonight. At midnight.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Really?

          

          

          

          

          4.

          HARVEY MILK
          And, believe it or not, I don't
          have any plans. People took me out
          after work...

          SCOTT SMITH
          (looking him over)
          Work? So, that would be... Let me
          guess. Ma Bell or AT&T.

          HARVEY MILK
          The Great American Insurance
          Company. I'm part of the big,
          evil, corporate establishment that,
          let me guess, you think is the
          cause of every evil thing in the
          world from Vietnam to diaper rash.

          SCOTT SMITH
          You left out bad breath.
          Falling for it, Harvey covers his mouth. Scott laughs. They
          both smile, realizing they share a wry sense of humor.
          A TRAIN IS COMING, Harvey has to work fast.

          HARVEY MILK
          So... You're not going to let me
          celebrate my birthday all by myself
          are you?

          SCOTT SMITH
          (gently teasing)
          Listen, Harvey, you're kind of cute
          for a suit... But I don't do guys
          over forty.

          HARVEY MILK
          Well then, I'm in luck.

          SCOTT SMITH
          How's that?

          HARVEY MILK
          Because I'm still thirty-nine...
          (showing Scott his watch)
          And it's only eleven-fifteen.

          14 INT. HARVEY'S NEW YORK APARTMENT - NIGHT

          IN A TIGHT TWO-SHOT, Scott is pressed against a wall with
          Harvey pressed against his back having sex. Harvey is the
          aggressor, completely uninhibited.

          ISOLDE)

          15 INT. HARVEY'S NEW YORK APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Harvey feeds Scott spoonfuls of CREAM PIE from a TRAY FULL of
          FOOD that rests on the bed between them. Ice cream, cookies,
          milk, berries... It's over the top and adorable.

          HARVEY MILK
          Where are you from?

          SCOTT SMITH
          Jackson, Mississippi.

          HARVEY MILK
          Well, this isn't Jackson, but you
          still can't respond to every
          strange man you meet on a subway
          platform. It's too dangerous.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Now you tell me.

          HARVEY MILK
          There's nothing tougher than a New
          York City cop. They're arrogant,
          and they're everywhere. I'll show
          you the cruising spots, if you
          want, if you promise you'll be
          careful... little Scottie-san.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Are you on uppers or what?

          HARVEY MILK
          No. This is just... plain old me.

          SCOTT SMITH
          You're afraid of the cops?

          HARVEY MILK
          I'm just discreet. I know a lot of
          people here. If they found out, I
          could lose my job.

          SCOTT SMITH
          (meaning a closet case)
          Oh. You're one of "those."
          (examines Harvey's eyes)
          I think you need a change of
          scenery. New friends.

          

          

          

          

          6.

          HARVEY MILK
          I need a change.

          SCOTT SMITH
          (looks at the clock)
          You're forty now.

          HARVEY MILK
          (just the truth)
          Forty years old and I haven't done
          a thing I'm proud of.

          SCOTT SMITH
          (re: the desert tray)
          You keep eating like this and
          you'll be a fat ass by fifty.

          HARVEY MILK
          (laughs it off)
          No. Don't you worry. I won't make
          it to fifty.
          Scott distracts him, playful, like a newlywed at a wedding,
          he rubs a slice of pie in Harvey's face.
          Harvey reacts. Wipes the pie from his eye, and tackles his
          young, frisky new lover. They kiss. The mess getting
          everywhere. Harvey brushes it out of Scott's hair.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          (an idea, half-jokingly,

          HALF-SERIOUSLY)
          Why don't we run away together?

          SCOTT SMITH
          Where to?

          16 INT. FLASH FORWARD - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT

          RETURN TO: Harvey speaks to the tape recorder. (Throughout
          the film, these scenes should feel intimate, as if Harvey is
          telling us things no one else knows.)

          HARVEY MILK
          In those days, San Francisco was
          the place where everyone wanted to
          go... To drop out... To fall in
          love...

          through the redwoods, over the Golden Gate Bridge, and into
          San Francisco.

          HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
          But by 1972, The Haight was boarded
          up. Crime-filled. Drug-filled. The
          new place for us refugees was this
          run down Irish Catholic
          neighborhood in Eureka Valley. Six
          blocks square... The Castro.

          17 EXT. CASTRO STREET - DAY

          Harvey lifts a Nikon camera and starts SNAPPING PHOTOS of
          Castro Street.

          WE SEE WHAT HARVEY SEES THROUGH THE LENS: A HARDWARE STORE,
          a LIQUOR STORE, empty buildings, boarded windows...
          Harvey points the camera toward The MARQUEE of the Castro
          Theater, big letters spelling out... "C A S T R O..."
          Harvey points his camera across the street at the gray-
          haired, OWNER of a liquor store. Harvey snaps PHOTOS of his
          face, an expression of distrust.
          Harvey SNAPS a SIGN in the liquor shop window that reads:

          "EUREKA VALLEY MERCHANTS SOCIETY."
          Harvey's CAMERA focuses on TWO CUTE, YOUNG, HIPPIE BOYS
          WALKING PAST, one puts his arm over the other. To Harvey's
          eyes it's a very new site. It's overt. Thrilling.
          Harvey snaps a photo of an empty storefront with a FOR RENT
          SIGN hanging out front.

          19 INT. HARVEY'S AND SCOTT'S EMPTY APARTMENT - DAY

          The place is FILLED with OPERA MUSIC from a record player.
          Harvey is loading a roll of film into his camera.
          Scott is getting high, lying in the sun that pours through
          the large, empty windows.

          SCOTT SMITH
          I cashed my last unemployment check
          yesterday...

          HARVEY MILK
          Well, I hope you did something
          useful with it.

          SCOTT SMITH
          I bought an ounce of pot. I was
          just wondering if you had any

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          8.

          SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D)
          plans, or thoughts... About us
          doing something to, you know, bring
          in an income.

          HARVEY MILK
          Don't move.
          Harvey straddles Scott. He begins SNAPPING PHOTOS of him.

          SCOTT SMITH
          I suppose I can wait tables.

          HARVEY
          No way. I want you right here with
          me... Did you see place downstairs
          is for rent?

          SCOTT SMITH
          Yeah.

          HARVEY MILK
          I was thinking we could open a shop
          together.

          SCOTT SMITH
          What kind of shop?

          HARVEY MILK
          One with very little overhead. Not
          too much work... A little one, just
          like Morris and Minnie Milk of
          Woodmere, New York...

          20 EXT. CASTRO STREET CAMERA SHOP - DAY (1973)

          Harvey's empty store front has been converted to a CAMERA
          STORE (with a few, not very impressive, products).
          Harvey is out on the sidewalk directing Scott who is inside
          the store's large window hanging a sign: "CASTRO CAMERA."

          HARVEY MILK
          Just a little to the left...
          The old liquor store owner from earlier, MCCONNELLY, crosses
          the street to watch. Harvey gives him a warm welcome:

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          Hello there. I'm Harvey Milk.

          MCCONNELLY
          You're the new renters?

          HARVEY MILK
          Yes. Welcome to Castro Camera.

          

          

          

          

          9.
          Harvey extends his hand. McConnelly shakes, but is wary.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          I want to join the, um... What is
          it? The Eureka Valley Merchant's
          Association. I want to help in any
          way possible. I'm no interloper.
          A Jew perhaps, but I hope you'll
          forgive that.
          McConnelly looks from Harvey to Scott in the window.

          MCCONNELLY
          I don't think your application will
          be approved, Mr. Milk. This is a
          family neighborhood. Your kind are
          far more welcome on Haight street.

          HARVEY MILK
          (trying to keep it friendly)
          What "kind" do you mean, sir?

          MCCONNELLY
          (not playing along)
          The Merchant's Association will
          have the police pull your license
          if you open your doors.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Based on what law?

          MCCONNELLY
          There's man's law and there's God's
          law in this neighborhood and in this
          City. The San Francisco Police
          force is happy to enforce either.

          HARVEY MILK
          (to McConnelly as he walks away)
          Thanks for the warm welcome to the
          neighborhood!

          SCOTT SMITH
          We pay taxes you know!
          Harvey grabs Scott's hand... keeps him from heating up, from
          pouncing. It's not the time for them to bite yet.

          21 INT. HARVEY AND SCOTT'S APARTMENT ABOVE THE STORE -- DAY

          Scott is sitting on the bed, while Harvey is TALKING A MILE A
          MINUTE FROM THE KITCHEN, totally energized.

          

          

          

          

          10.

          HARVEY MILK
          We'll form our own business
          association! Start with the gay-
          owned businesses... We'll take down
          the addresses of every customer that
          comes in for a roll of film. We'll
          ask them what they want to see done
          here... what they want changed...
          We'll get money rolling into this
          neighborhood. Revitalize it...

          SCOTT SMITH
          Can I come in now?

          HARVEY MILK (O.S.)
          One more minute!
          (back to his new scheme)
          I'll go to the neighborhood banks.
          They must have some gay customers.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Harvey. What's with all this
          political activist crap? I thought
          you were a goddamn Republican.
          Harvey walks into the small dining room holding two plates of
          food. He sets them out on a small dining room table, still
          rambling on to Scott in the bedroom.

          HARVEY MILK
          I'm a businessman, Scott. I think
          businesses ought to treat their
          customers right. Even their gay
          customers. For God's sake, this is
          San Francisco!

          SCOTT SMITH
          Harvey. It's just like every other
          city in this country. People hate
          us. Big surprise.

          HARVEY MILK
          We should have at least one block
          in one city right? Start there and
          take over the neighborhood.
          (a smile)
          Okay, you can come in now!
          Scott heads toward the kitchen. The table is LAID OUT with a
          home-cooked meal, CANDLES and a huge bouquet of FLOWERS.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Wow. This is--

          

          

          

          

          11.
          Harvey SMASHES A CREAM PIE into Scott's face. Payback.

          HARVEY MILK
          Happy birthday!
          Scott chases Harvey around the apartment, trying to smear
          some of the CREAM PIE onto him.

          22 EXT. THE CASTRO - DAY

          The street is shut down for the first ever Castro Street
          Fair. The crowd is mostly gay, the majority congregate
          outside Toad Hall bar.
          ANGLE ON: SOME OF THE OLD-SCHOOL, IRISH LOCALS milling about,
          eyeing the scene skeptically.
          Harvey MOVES THROUGH THE CROWD with Scott, shaking hands.

          MAN ON THE STREET
          Thanks for the party, Mr. Milk!

          HARVEY MILK
          Thanks for joining the Castro
          Village Association!
          Harvey arrives at A LONG LINE OF GAY MEN winding out of the
          Irish liquor store (from earlier). He squeezes past them,
          into the store, leaving Scott outside.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          Excuse me gentleman... ladies.
          (finding the shop owner)
          Hello! Mr. McConnelly!
          McConnelly, at the register, is overwhelmed with all the new
          business.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          I just wanted to stop in and see
          how business was doing.

          MCCONNELLY
          Fine.

          HARVEY MILK
          So you don't mind all these
          homosexuals in here, do you?
          McConnelly grins, uncomfortable. The line of gay men is
          curious about the hubbub. Point made, Harvey does a 180.

          

          

          

          

          12.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          No. No. Just a joke. Mr. McConnelly
          here loves our kind. Spend away!
          (to McConnelly)
          Tell your wife Hello for me.
          Harvey spots Scott in the crowd and PULLS HIM TOWARD HIM,
          KISSING HIM ON THE MOUTH. It's quite the show. They step
          back out onto the street where an Irish band is now playing.
          Gay men watch. Some clap. Harvey grabs Scott and spins him
          through a sharp waltz. OFF the pair at home in their new
          neighborhood.

          23 INT. FLASH FORWARD - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT


           HARVEY MILK
          And people started hanging around
          our store. Not customers.
          Activists, kids, folks who needed a
          home away from home...

          26 EXT. CASTRO CAMERA - INTERCUT

          A NEW sign goes in the window: "We are VERY open."

          27 INT. CASTRO CAMERA SHOP - DAY

          A FEW YOUNG MEN are hanging out in the shop, the beginnings
          of Harvey's entourage. Harvey moves among them, sharing a
          clipped Sunday cartoon, lecturing them on politics or the
          arts, and checking out the cute ones.

          HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
          There was Danny Niccoletta, a cute
          art student who I'd picked up at
          Toad Hall. Turns out he was also
          good at running the Camera Shop...
          something Scott and I found we had
          surprising little interest in...
          ON DANNY NICCOLETTA, young, waif-like, somewhat helpless.

          DANNY NICCOLETTA
          Opera is passe, Harvey. It's about
          street theater, now.

          HARVEY MILK
          What you're not getting is the
          spectacle of it, the bigger than
          life emotions...
          Danny jumps up and IMITATES the LARGER THAN LIFE GESTURES of
          an opera diva, making Harvey laugh.

          

          

          

          

          13.

          HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Jim Rivaldo. A great mind. A great
          wit. A Harvard graduate, which
          nobody cared about, in those days,
          in the Castro... including himself.
          JIM RIVALDO flops down into the vintage dental chair that
          sits in front of Harvey's desk. He seems to be looking for
          something to occupy his keen mind. A sharply dressed young
          man, 20s, DICK PABICH, walks up to peek over his shoulder.

          HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          And somewhere along the line Jim
          picked up a protege, a cute
          political kid from Wisconsin... Dick
          Pabich... And of course there was
          Dennis Peron, who ran a very popular
          business with the new kids...
          DENNIS PERON hands Scott a FREE JOINT.

          HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          And on occasion we actually had a
          real customer. But only occasionally.
          ACROSS THE ROOM, Scott is waiting on a CUSTOMER, he's out of
          place: straight, gruff, a union man, ALLAN BAIRD, 40s.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Harvey... This guy wants to talk to
          you.

          HARVEY MILK
          (approaches Allan)
          Welcome. What can we do for you?

          ALLAN BAIRD
          Hi, I'm Allan Baird. Teamsters
          representative, and Director of the
          Coors beer boycott in California.

          HARVEY MILK
          Everyone, this is Allan Baird. He's
          a very big deal, so behave
          yourselves.

          ALLAN BAIRD
          I was told you were like the Mayor
          of the Castro, said you organized
          the CVA, you might know some people
          in the bars.

          

          

          

          

          14.

          HARVEY MILK
          I do have friends in awfully low
          places, but just so you know, it's
          not official yet.

          ALLAN BAIRD
          What's that?

          HARVEY MILK
          The Mayor part. I've considered
          gathering an army of queers to
          march up to City Hall and secede,
          but so far the young gays seem more
          interested in jeeps and jeans. But
          if I could be of any use, I'm all
          ears!

          ALLAN BAIRD
          We can't get Coors to go union.
          These guys are like me, they can't
          be out of work too long.
          Harvey pulls Allan aside, away from the audience, easing his
          nerves. It's Harvey at his best.

          HARVEY MILK
          I'm just curious. Are we your first
          stop or your last?

          ALLAN BAIRD
          (clearly his last)
          It's been a tough one, Mr. Milk.

          HARVEY MILK
          Well, you seem to have noticed that
          my kind of people drink a lot of
          beer. If we're going to fast for
          your sake, I think we should get to
          deliver some of it when you win
          this fight, don't you?

          ALLAN BAIRD

          (INCREDULOUS)
          Is that what you really want?

          HARVEY MILK
          And allies. I'll have Coors out of
          every bar in the Castro by the end
          of the week. Deal?

          ALLAN BAIRD
          (nods, sincere)
          Thank you Mr. Milk.

          

          

          

          

          15.
          JUMP TO: Allan is on his way out. Harvey walks back behind
          the counter to Scott.

          HARVEY MILK
          No more Coors beer. It's gotta come
          out of every bar. Gay and straight.

          SCOTT SMITH
          What's he giving you?

          HARVEY MILK
          Nothing for me. That's a convert.

          SCOTT SMITH
          A convert to what?

          HARVEY MILK
          The cause.

          27A INT. VARIOUS SAN FRANCISCO BARS - PHOTO MONTAGE

          A STILL PHOTO MONTAGE: Jim, Dick, Scott and Danny get bar
          owners throughout San Francisco to unscrew their Coors taps,
          throw out their Coors stock, put on "Boycott Coors" buttons
          and tape up "Dump Coors" posters.

          HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
          I got "my people" to get Coors out
          of all the Gay Bars. 30 million
          bottles worth in San Francisco
          alone. Coors beer immediately fell
          from number 1. They caved. One week
          later, union man Allan Baird hired
          the first ever openly gay union
          boys to drive Teamsters trucks...
          We weren't just a group of pansies
          anymore. We had a neighborhood. We
          had the unions. And for the first
          time, we had a little bit of power.

          27B INT. FLASH FORWARD - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT


           HARVEY MILK
          Maybe that was the day someone
          first called me the "Mayor" of
          Castro Street.
          (a knowing grin)
          Or perhaps I invented it myself.

          28 INT. CASTRO CAMERA - ANOTHER NIGHT

          Harvey, Jim & Dick, Scott, Danny and Dennis debate the merits
          of working within "the system" versus dropping out. Everyone
          is talking over each other...

          

          

          

          

          16.
          A YOUNG GAY MAN runs into the store.

          YOUNG GAY MAN
          The fucking cops, man, they're up on
          Castro Street! Toad Hall.
          Harvey and the guys race out of the store.

          29 EXT. CASTRO STREET - DAY

          Harvey, Scott, Jim, Dick, Dennis run up the street toward one
          of the Castro GAY BARS where POLICE ARE GETTING OUT OF SQUAD
          CARS AND APPROACHING CUSTOMERS crowding around the entrance.

          COP
          Clear the sidewalk!
          Some of the GAY MEN move out of the COPS' way but some of
          them don't move FAST ENOUGH. The COPS start BEATING them.
          Harvey, Scott and the OTHERS try to break into the crowd, to
          get closer to the fight. To pull the cops off their friends.
          Danny HANGS BACK, snapping PHOTOS of the event.
          Scott SHOVES his way past the cops. A COP BRINGS HIS NIGHT
          STICK down hard on SCOTT'S HEAD.

          30 INT. HARVEY'S AND SCOTT'S BATHROOM - THAT NIGHT

          Scott sits on the toilet. Harvey rinses blood from a white
          washcloth and goes back to cleaning Scott's HEAD WOUND.

          HARVEY MILK
          ...if we had someone in the
          government who saw things the way
          we see them, the way the black
          community has black leaders who
          look out for their interests--

          SCOTT SMITH
          You're gonna run for Supervisor, is
          that the idea?

          HARVEY MILK

          (HALF-JOKING)
          I could go right for mayor, but I
          think I should work my way up to
          it... You'll be my campaign
          manager.

          

          

          

          

          17.

          SCOTT SMITH

          (SARCASTIC)
          Because I have so much experience
          in politics.

          HARVEY MILK
          Politics is theater. It doesn't
          matter if you win. You make a
          statement. You say, "I'm here, pay
          attention to me."

          SCOTT SMITH
          Harvey, you do that every time you
          cross the street.

          HARVEY MILK
          Coors looks like it might cave. The
          union boys will owe me. Imagine if
          we get their vote... It'll be fun!

          SCOTT SMITH
          Fun?
          Harvey starts kissing him all over.

          HARVEY MILK
          We'll make it a spectacle.

          31 EXT. CASTRO STREET - DAY

          Harvey walks down to Market St. with a box. He waves, shakes,
          flirts with everyone. His warmest hello is from a gruff UNION
          MAN. Behind Harvey, Scott pushes a loaded shopping cart.
          Harvey sets his box down right beside a SFPD OFFICER. It
          reads, â€œSoap Box.â€� Harvey steps onto it. A crowd forms.

          HARVEY MILK
          A week ago, Police officers came
          into our area with covered up
          badges and sent fourteen of our
          people to the hospitals, and to
          jail. The charges, "Blocking a
          Sidewalk."
          Like a round girl at a boxing match, Scott parades around a
          blown up PHOTO from his shopping cart: TWO SF COPS DRAGGING

          GAY MEN INTO A PADDY WAGON.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          --Let us have our tax money go for
          our protection and not our
          persecution. Worry about gun
          control and not marijuana control.

          18.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          School supplies, seniors, not what
          books I read--
          Scott displays an old "Muscle Boys" magazine. Harvey does a
          well timed take. A few hoots from the eclectic crowd.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          My fellow degenerates, I would like
          to announce my candidacy for San
          Francisco City Supervisor!
          Scott unfurls three hand made "MILK FOR CITY SUPERVISOR"
          banners that lap over the sides of the shopping cart.

          32 EXT. VARIOUS STREETS IN SF - HANDING OUT FLYERS MONTAGE

          WE SEE SCOTT, DANNY, JIM handing out FLYERS to a variety of
          SF CITIZENS: gay boys, older people, Chinese people, scared
          straight people, heckling high school boys.
          Harvey EAGERLY APPROACHES anyone and everyone, shaking hands
          if they'll let him, reaching out to old people, straight
          people, gay people, even buttoned down BUSINESSMEN who cross
          the street to try to get away from him.

          33 EXT. THE CASTRO/18TH AND CASTRO - DAY

          Harvey hands out campaign literature to a PASSERSBY.

          HARVEY MILK
          Public dental care for retired
          people... Legalize pot, vote Milk.
          Harvey is distracted. A young, long haired CLEVE JONES
          passes. At 18, he looks 15. Harvey tries for his attention:

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          Hey, I like the way your pants
          fit... Where are you from, kid?

          CLEVE JONES

          (LAUGHS)
          Sorry old man, not interested.

          HARVEY MILK
          Where's home?

          CLEVE JONES
          Phoenix.

          HARVEY MILK
          I'm Harvey Milk. I'm running for
          Supervisor. What's your name?

          

          

          

          

          19.

          CLEVE JONES
          Cleve... Jones.

          HARVEY MILK
          Well Mr. Jones, we should walk up
          to my camera shop and register you.

          CLEVE JONES
          Fuck that. Elections of any kind
          are a bourgeois affectation.

          HARVEY MILK
          Is that right? Do you trick up on
          Polk Street?

          CLEVE JONES
          (only half-joking)
          If I need the cash... But I'm
          selective about my clients.

          HARVEY MILK
          Tell me one thing before you get
          back to work then. What was it like
          to be a little queer in Phoenix?

          CLEVE JONES
          I faked a lung disease to get out
          of PE. So what? What are you, some
          kind of street shrink?

          HARVEY MILK
          Sometimes. But what I'm saying is,
          Phoenix can change. But we have to
          start with our street: rent control,
          police abuse, pot, parks, seniors.

          CLEVE JONES
          (turns to go)
          Well, good luck with all that.

          HARVEY MILK
          You know what I think, Cleve Jones?

          CLEVE JONES
          That you're gonna get somewhere if
          you keep talking?

          HARVEY MILK
          No. That you need to do what you're
          good at. Be a prick. Fight City
          Hall. Fight the cops. Fight the
          people who made you come here to do
          what you do.

          

          

          

          

          20.

          CLEVE JONES
          Sorry old man, I'm leaving for
          Spain tomorrow. Europe. Got all the
          cash I need in my back pocket.
          A GROUP OF CLEVE'S FRIENDS shout at him to join them. Harvey
          watches him dart across the street to his friends.

          HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
          I didn't come out until very late
          in life. There was nobody to--

          34 INT. FLASH FORWARD - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL


           HARVEY MILK
          --look up to, no hope for a better
          life. Those that did were
          outcast... arrested.. suicide. And
          the young ones, who did escape
          home... and who arrive in San
          Francisco, and then what...

          35 EXT. CHURCH STREET - EVENING

          ANGLE ON: PARAMEDICS placing a BLOODY VICTIM into a BODY BAG.

          COP
          The â€œfruitâ€� was walking home with
          his â€œtrickâ€� when they were jumped.
          REVEAL: Harvey picks a blood stained whistle up off the
          street, the man's last attempt to call for help.

          COP (CONT'D)
          (from the victim's wallet)
          Name's Robert Hillsborough. Did you
          know him?

          HARVEY MILK
          He used to come into my shop. Are
          there any witnesses?

          COP
          Just the "trick." Jerry Taylor.

          HARVEY MILK
          Jerry wasn't a trick. They were
          lovers.

          COP
          Call it what you will. He's our
          only witness and he says he can't
          identify the attackers.

          

          

          

          

          21.

          HARVEY MILK
          There'd be a dozen witnesses if
          they thought you boys had any real
          interest in keeping them safe.

          COP
          You're the Mayor of Castro Street
          now, right Harvey? You really wanna
          help? Get your people to show some
          discretion on the streets, huh?
          HARVEY'S POV: The PARAMEDICS pull up the zipper on the body
          bag. We follow the zipper past the victim's bloody hands, his
          torso, his face.

          36 INT. CASTRO CAMERA - DAY


          CLOSE ON: A CUSTOMER'S SET OF PHOTOS BEING PASSED FROM HAND
          TO HAND DURING THE FOLLOWING POLITICAL MEETING. (We catch a
          glimpse of the PHOTOS and see naked skin).

          JIM RIVALDO
          Well, it looks like the big guns
          and the rich gays in San Francisco
          are going to back Dianne Feinstein
          and other straight candidates they
          consider "gay-friendly."

          SCOTT SMITH
          Who cares about those old queens?
          Scott is laying down on THE BIG RED COUCH.

          HARVEY MILK
          Why isn't my campaign manager
          leading the meeting?

          SCOTT SMITH
          I'm beat, Harvey. I passed out
          flyers for seven hours straight.

          HARVEY MILK
          In the bathhouse?

          SCOTT SMITH
          (giving it right back)
          People in bathhouses vote. I'm
          tired. I'm taking a nap.
          Scott heads up the stairs to their apartment.
          A CUSTOMER comes in. Danny quickly gathers the REVEALING
          PHOTOS and puts them back in the envelope.

          HARVEY MILK
          Just checking the exposure. That a
          new boyfriend? He's very cute.

          CUSTOMER
          (taking the photos, embarrassed)
          Um... Thanks, Harvey.

          HARVEY MILK
          (to Jim)
          So who are these so-called "gay
          leaders?" And who appointed them?
          And what are you suggesting, Jim,
          that I'm supposed to go and solicit
          their endorsement?
          PAST HARVEY WE SEE A GRANDMOTHERLY VOLUNTEER, THELMA, opening
          the mail, casually reading a letter, then rising and
          approaching Harvey.

          THELMA

          HARVEY--

          HARVEY MILK
          We're down here, on the streets,
          trying to help people, so where
          they hell are they?

          DICK PABICH
          David Goodstein is the publisher of
          The Advocate and he has a house--

          THELMA
          (clearly shaken)
          Harvey, you should read this.
          CLOSE ON THE LETTER as it goes from Thelma to Harvey.

          37 INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT / KITCHEN - LATER

          Scott reads the LETTER. Harvey sits VERY STILL.

          SCOTT SMITH
          "Harvey Milk will have a dream
          journey and nightmare to hell, a
          night of horror. You will be
          stabbed and have your genitals,
          cock, balls, prick cut off."

          I'm calling the police.

          HARVEY MILK
          They probably wrote it.
          (off Scott's anxiety)
          Hey, If somebody tries to kill me,
          I'll get the sympathy vote, right?
          Could be just the push we need.

          SCOTT SMITH
          You think this is funny?
          Look at it.
          Reluctantly, Harvey takes the letter from Scott.

          HARVEY MILK
          It's a complete joke. No rhythm. No
          humor. It's insulting.
          CLOSE ON THE LETTER: Someone has drawn a STICK FIGURE of
          Harvey being tortured - bullets, knives, fire, etc. Harvey
          makes a DECISION: He sticks the DRAWING to the refrigerator,
          the first thing he'll see in the morning.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Don't do that.

          HARVEY MILK
          If you put it away, hide it in a
          drawer, it'll just get bigger and
          scarier. Now it's there. We'll
          see it every day. It can't get us.

          SCOTT SMITH
          All this energy... to make yourself
          a target. And what for? Something
          we have no chance to win.
          Harvey wraps his arms around him.

          HARVEY MILK
          I keep telling you, it's not just
          about winning.

          38 EXT. DAVID GOODSTEIN'S MANSION - DAY

          Harvey, in his work boots and jeans, watches as a LARGE GATE
          SLIDES OPEN allowing his entry. Scott, even scruffier looking
          than Harvey, stands next to him.

          HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
          The "top gays" in San Francisco
          were David Goodstein and his lawyer
          sidekick Rick Stokes. David was a

          rich old queen who'd bought the
          biggest gay magazine, The Advocate.
          He had it delivered to subscribers
          in brown paper bags so no-one would
          know... That's how he lived his
          life, covered up, discreet.
          Harvey and Scott are shown to the pool area by a HOUSE BOY.
          Statues and potted plants and expensive marble. Everything
          shouts "GOOD TASTE!"
          Scott strips off his clothes and DIVES INTO THE POOL.

          40 EXT. GOODSTEIN'S POOL - LATER

          Harvey has lunch with the "gay establishment": DAVID
          GOODSTEIN, 58, gold and turquoise jewelry, and Goodstein's
          protÃ©gÃ©, RICK STOKES, 45, reserved.
          Rick can't keep his eyes off naked Scott in the pool.

          DAVID GOODSTEIN
          I worked for a financial
          institution. I was very discreet.
          But someone spotted me at the
          opera, sitting in a box, next to my
          lover. And I was fired. That's
          when I decided to do something. So
          I bought The Advocate. And I use
          my money and my influence in quiet
          ways, to do what I can...

          HARVEY MILK
          Endorsing straight candidates is
          what you think is best to help us?

          DAVID GOODSTEIN
          Yes, if they're friendly to our
          cause.

          RICK STOKES

          (DEFENSIVE)
          Politics is complicated in San
          Francisco, and Supervisor is a
          citywide office. Political alliances
          need to be built. You can't simply
          move here from across the country
          and run for office.

          HARVEY MILK
          But I am running for office. I'm on
          the ballot. I have the union rank
          and file, the seniors, and I could
          use your magazine's endorsement.

          

          

          

          

          25.

          DAVID GOODSTEIN
          Harvey, we're like the Catholic
          church. We welcome converts, but we
          don't make them Pope the same day.

          HARVEY MILK
          And why haven't you run?

          DAVID GOODSTEIN
          It's too early for a gay candidate
          for Supervisor. Especially one
          from the Castro. It's bad for the
          community's image.
          Scott climbs out of the pool and sits at the table, naked and
          sopping wet.

          SCOTT SMITH
          What's wrong with the Castro?

          DAVID GOODSTEIN
          Nobody works there. It's all sex
          and drugs and more sex and no one
          taking responsibility for their own
          problems.

          HARVEY MILK
          The cops come into our neighborhood
          and beat us. They turn a blind eye
          if one of us is murdered.

          RICK STOKES
          Then we file a lawsuit against the
          city. We go to our political allies
          in City Hall...

          HARVEY MILK
          There are no real gay allies. Yes,
          our friends may sense our struggle,
          but they can't feel it. It's not
          life or death for them. We need our
          own in office.

          RICK STOKES
          You can't demand acceptance overnight.

          HARVEY MILK
          Why not? How can we ask them to
          respect us if we don't show
          ourselves some self respect, David.

          

          

          

          

          26.

          DAVID GOODSTEIN
          The more â€œoutâ€� you make us, the
          more you incite them. Step back and
          quiet down.

          HARVEY MILK
          Go back into the closet? Is that
          what you're saying? Because I know
          the closet. I lived in it for more
          years than I care to remember.
          (rising to go)
          I don't need your endorsement. I'm
          not asking anyone for acceptance.
          I don't have time to ask.

          DAVID GOODSTEIN
          For you, politics is a game, a
          lark. Like putting on a rock
          festival or staging a "love-in."
          You're too old to be a hippie,
          Harvey Milk!
          Harvey turns around, ready for a fight.

          HARVEY MILK
          I'm not a candidate, I'm part of a
          movement. The movement is the
          candidate. There's a difference. You
          don't see the difference. But I do.

          SCOTT SMITH
          (getting Harvey out)
          Thanks for the swim. I'm sorry I
          pissed in your pool.

          41 EXT. THE CASTRO - ELECTION DAY

          A SLOW MOTION MONTAGE OF: the citizens of the Castro are
          turning out to vote. Young, old, gay, straight... but a
          weight hangs over the day.

          HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
          When the vote came in on election
          day... out of 32 candidates vying
          for 6 seats... We came in 10th.
          Just a handful short of being the
          first big eared, gay as a three-
          dollar-bill, cock sucker ever
          elected to public office.

           HARVEY MILK
          So... I went for it again in '75...
          with just a few... minor...
          adjustments.

          43 INT. SECOND HAND STORE IN THE CASTRO - DAY

          CLOSE ON: Harvey looking through a hole in the bottom of a
          pair of well worn wing-tips. He tries them on anyhow.
          JUMP TO: Harvey steps out of a dressing room in a brown suit.
          His hair is cut short, his face is shaven clean. It's quite a
          transformation. Scott and the old owner, LILY, size him up.

          SCOTT SMITH
          No. Not cute. The shoes are hideous
          and I hate your hair. You're not
          fooling anybody.

          HARVEY MILK
          I'm not gonna let the Pacific
          Heights biddies write me off again
          because of a ponytail. I like it.
          Scott is horrified. Harvey pulls a pair of movie ticket stubs
          from its inner pocket.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          Cabaret? For two? Lily, is this
          from one of my kind?

          LILY
          No, no. You won't run into the
          owner. He died in that suit.

          SCOTT SMITH
          This isn't sexy, Harvey.
          Harvey grabs Scott, kisses him. Then playful:

          HARVEY MILK
          Too bad. No more pot, no more bath
          houses for me and little poo.

          44 INT/EXT. CASTRO CAMERA - DAY

          MONTAGE: More ACTIVITY inside and outside the shop. More
          VOLUNTEERS. The printing press burns through flyers.

          HARVEY MILK (V.O.)

          more votes than ever. So in 1976,
          against everyone's advice, I really
          pissed off the Democratic political
          power houses, because I ran against
          "their boy"--

          A SIGN GOES IN THE SHOP WINDOW "HARVEY MILK VS. THE MACHINE."

          HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          --Art Agnos, a part of their
          "Political Machine." And this time
          we weren't running for City
          Supervisor. This time it was
          bigger, California State Assembly.

          50 INT. HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW / CANDIDATE DEBATE - NIGHT

           It's a firestorm of words as Harvey debates Art Agnos.

           HARVEY MILK
          It's a racket. It's 1976 and you
          still have to be straight, white,
          Catholic and male to get into the
          San Francisco police force. It's
          Racist. Homophobic.

          ART AGNOS
          How many people do you consider
          enemies, Harvey? I've counted five
          already.
          Art smiles. Chuckles flutter through the audience.

          HARVEY MILK
          You're right, Art. And many are
          your closest friends. You see, I
          don't think State Assembly seats
          should be awarded on the basis of
          service to the Democrat Machine.
          Machines operate on oil and grease.
          They're dirty, dehumanizing, and
          too often unresponsive to any needs
          but those of the operator.

          ART AGNOS
          Mr. Milk, I've worked for years as
          a social worker in this city. I
          know Sacramento. I know how to get
          done what we all need done there.

          HARVEY MILK
          Tell me Mr. Agnos... right here in
          the Castro, Robert Hillsbourough
          was murdered for walking home with
          his long time partner. Stabbed,

          fifteen times. The last words he
          heard were "Faggot, Faggot,
          Faggot..." And you say you're
          outraged, but why won't your
          liberal establishment return our
          calls? Why won't they bring these
          murderers to justice?

          51 EXT. HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW - LATER

          Art Agnos puts his arm around Harvey as they walk out.

          ART AGNOS
          You know Harv', your whole rap's a
          real downer.

          HARVEY MILK
          My God, you're handsome up close. I
          can't tell you how much I'm looking
          forward to licking you... in the
          polls.

          ART AGNOS

          (LAUGHS)
          You talk a lot about what you're
          against. What are you for? In this
          town, you gotta give em' a reason
          for optimism or you're cooked.
          Art gets into his car and goes. Harvey has no car. He stops
          and PONDERS ART'S WORDS... They stick with him.

          51A INT. HARVEY'S AND SCOTT'S APARTMENT - EVENING

          Scott tries to make a simple meal of pasta, struggling to
          operate in the kitchen that is filled with Harvey's POLITICAL
          ENTOURAGE and VOLUNTEERS.
          He finds Harvey, Jim, and Dick having an impromptu strategy
          meeting in the adjoining bedroom.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Harvey. Dinner.

          HARVEY
          ... get some union boys in the
          audience, they love me...

          I can't control who's in the
          audience...

          Harvey, you need to eat something.

          Scott steps back into the kitchen.

          Ladies and Gentlemen. Our apartment
          is officially off limits.
          CHASES the VOLUNTEERS out of the kitchen, out of his
          bedroom... down the stairs...

          SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D)
          Downstairs. Time to go. Go. OUT!
          Harvey emerges, about to intervene.

          SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D)
          Don't say anything.
          For once, Harvey keeps his mouth shut. Jim and Dick sneak
          past Scott, sheepishly. When Scott and Harvey are alone...

          SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D)
          Sit down and eat.
          Harvey and Scott eat dinner in tense silence.

          If you say one thing about politics
          or your campaign or where you're
          speaking tonight or whose
          endorsement you need... I'll stab
          you with my fork I swear to God.

          HARVEY
          I just wanted to say... This is
          the most delicious meal I've ever
          eaten in my entire life.
          Harvey gives a warm smile. Scott gives a laugh, but he looks
          like he's about to lose it.

          HARVEY MILK
          If we lose this one, it'll be just
          me and you again. I promise.
          Scott nods. That's exactly what he needed to hear.

          52 EXT. THE CASTRO - NIGHT

          Harvey walks Castro's streets alone, toward his apartment.

          

          

          

          

          31.
          A CAR PULLS UP BEHIND HARVEY. A MAN jumps out of the car, and
          the driver speeds around the block. Harvey turns a corner.
          The man follows. Harvey picks up his pace. He searches his
          pockets for a whistle, a weapon, and beelines it to his shop,
          his nerves are failing him.
          He gets to the doorway of his camera store, and runs face
          first into: CLEVE JONES. He's not the feisty young kid he met
          on the street earlier. He's been sitting on Harvey's steps,
          waiting with wet eyes.

          HARVEY MILK
          Phoenix?
          (off Cleve's smile)
          We should go inside.
          They do. Harvey locks the door behind them.

          53 INT. CASTRO CAMERA - LATER

          Harvey pours two cups of coffee, and delivers one to Cleve
          who is pulled away on the big red couch.

          CLEVE JONES
          You staying up with me?

          HARVEY MILK
          The election's tomorrow. I won't
          sleep... Was he good looking?

          CLEVE JONES
          No. He was hideous.

          HARVEY MILK
          Hard to tell what's worse. With me,
          my boyfriends usually find better
          looking ones to cheat with.

          CLEVE JONES
          I thought we were gonna spend the
          rest of our lives together.

          HARVEY MILK
          Guess what, Cleve Jones.

          CLEVE JONES
          What?

          HARVEY MILK
          You're going to meet the most
          extraordinary men, the sexiest,
          brightest, funniest men, and you're
          going to fall in love with so many
          of them, and you won't know until

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          the end of your life who your
          greatest friends were or your
          greatest love was.

          CLEVE JONES
          Is that supposed to help?

          HARVEY MILK
          Maybe a little. Or not.

          CLEVE JONES
          I went to Spain last month... long
          story. In Barcelona, there was this
          memorial march for gay people who
          died under Franco. The police tried
          to break it up. It started a riot.
          A bullet ripped through a drag
          queens scalp, his wig flew off, but
          he kept fighting. There was blood
          literally running in the gutter.

          HARVEY MILK
          We could have a revolution here
          too. But you can't just use the
          Castro to cruise. You gotta fight.

          CLEVE JONES
          You think you'll win?

          HARVEY MILK
          Winning isn't my strong suit.

          CLEVE JONES

          (BRAVADO)
          Well, I don't "do" losing. Ever.
          Maybe I should run for office, and
          you can work for me.
          (off Harvey's laugh)
          If you can do it, I can do it.

          HARVEY MILK
          Can you assemble a thousand people
          in an hour?

          CLEVE JONES
          Yeah, sure.

          HARVEY MILK
          All right, if I run again, you're
          my man.

          CLEVE JONES
          If...?

          

          

          

          

          33.

          HARVEY MILK
          Polls open in 3 hours. Lets hit the
          bus stops.

          54 EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - DAY

          Harvey is on the back of a motorcycle. The driver heads up
          Market Street. Folks stand in voting lines, flags outside of
          polling places. City Hall's tall dome grows nearer.

          HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
          And we lost that Assembly Race too,
          which made me a bona fide three-
          time, political loser.

          55 INT. CASTRO CAMERA - NIGHT

          CLOSE ON THE TV SET PLAYING A 1970's ORANGE JUICE COMMERCIAL
          featuring runner up to Miss America, ANITA BRYANT.

          ANITA BRYANT (SINGING ON TV)
          "Come to the Florida sunshine tree,
          great tasting orange juice
          naturally, orange juice with lots
          of vitamin c, from the Florida
          sunshine tree."
          Harvey is alone in the shop, surrounded by remnants of a
          celebration party that never happened.
          Jim Rivaldo lets himself into the store. Jim has his maps
          rolled up under his arm.

          JIM RIVALDO
          (trying to cheer up Harvey)
          We lost, but we lost by less! More
          votes than ever...
          (Harvey fake grins)
          I remember when that used to work.
          I want to show you something. This
          is remarkable.
          Jim starts laying out his trusty MAPS, color coded with
          precinct results from that night.

          JIM RIVALDO (CONT'D)
          The red is where you did best
          tonight. If we can get the
          initiative on district elections to
          pass, and we can -- we can -- our
          new Supervisor's District will go
          right up Market. Right around the
          Castro.

          

          

          

          

          34.
          The district Jim outlines is ALL BRIGHT RED.

          JIM RIVALDO (CONT'D)
          If you run for Supervisor with this
          new district, it's a potential
          landslide. You'll be the first up-
          front gay man elected to major
          office in the U.S.

          HARVEY MILK
          I don't know if I have another one
          in me. Or Scott.
          But Harvey's gaze deceives his words. HOLD ON HARVEY -
          contemplating a FOURTH run for office.

          56 INT. CASTRO CAMERA - EVENING

          The GROUP gathers around the TV WHICH SHOWS NATIONWIDE NEWS
          CLIPS OF ANITA BRYANT celebrating her election victory in
          Florida (overturning a pro-gay statute).
          A CHYRON READS: "Landslide defeat for Florida Gay Rights
          Law."

          ANITA BRYANT (ON TV)
          Tonight the laws of God and the
          cultural values of man have been
          vindicated. The people of Dade
          county, the normal majority, have
          said enough, enough, enough.

          ON THE TV: A REPORT ABOUT ANITA BRYANT'S VICTORY IN FLORIDA.

          TV REPORTER
          Gays in Florida can now be removed
          from their jobs and prosecuted if
          their "deviant" lifestyles are
          uncovered.

          HARVEY MILK
          Scottie?

          BOY'S VOICE
          I'm sorry sir. I um... I read about
          you in the paper.

          HARVEY MILK
          I'm sorry. I can't talk right--

          BOY'S VOICE
          Sir, I think I want to kill myself.

          HARVEY MILK
          No. You don't want to do that.

          (BEAT)
          Where do you live?

          BOY'S VOICE
          In Minnesota.

          HARVEY MILK
          You saw me in a paper in Minnesota?
          How'd I look?

          BOY'S VOICE
          My folks are taking me to this place
          tomorrow. A hospital. To fix me.

          HARVEY MILK
          There's nothing wrong with you.
          Listen to me. You don't have to
          hurt yourself, okay? Are you there?
          (only breathing from the
          other end)
          Here's what you have to do. Are you
          listening?

          BOY'S VOICE
          Yes.

          HARVEY MILK
          Get on a bus. Go to the next
          biggest city. New York, San
          Francisco, LA, or even Minneapolis.
          It doesn't matter. Just leave.
          (off the boy's tears)
          You won't be alone. There are
          people out here just like you who
          will welcome you and love you.

          I can't.

          HARVEY MILK
          Yes. You can. Just get on a bus.

          BOY'S VOICE
          I can't... I can't walk, sir. I'm
          in a wheelchair... Sir. Are you
          there?
          Harvey FORCES HIMSELF TO SOUND CALM...

          HARVEY MILK
          That's okay. It's going to be okay.
          Over the phone, Harvey hears the SOUND OF AN ADULT VOICE,
          someone finding the BOY on the phone, then...
          The LINE goes DEAD. It's all too much for Harvey. There's
          nothing a speech or a pep talk can do to fix this. Harvey is
          overwhelmed. Dick comes upstairs.

          DICK PABICH
          Harvey, you better come down.
          There's gonna be a riot.
          Moving in a daze, stunned by the call, Harvey digs out A
          BULLHORN and heads out.

          Cleve RUSHES into the bar (ON FIRE WITH RIGHTEOUS FURY) and
          BLOWS A POLICE WHISTLE to get everyone's attention.

          CLEVE JONES
          Out of the bar and into the
          streets! Anita Bryant is coming
          after you!

          59 EXT. CASTRO AND MARKET STREET - NIGHT

          Angry young men mill around the streets, their rage building.
          Someone TOSSES a trash can and it ROLLS.
          A POLICEMAN in riot gear comes up to Harvey.

          POLICEMAN
          If you can't control em', we will.

          HARVEY MILK
          Give me permission to march them.

          POLICEMAN
          Where?

           HARVEY MILK
           Anywhere.

          60 EXT. CASTRO AND MARKET STREET - MOMENTS LATER

          Surrounded by the massive crowd, HARVEY CLIMBS THE LARGE BOX
          that covers the subway construction at Market and Castro.
          It's a stage of sorts. Harvey lifts his bullhorn to his lips.

          HARVEY MILK
          I know you are angry. I am angry.
          Follow me through the streets of
          San Francisco to share our anger!
          Harvey jumps down and begins walking, not sure if the mob
          will follow. Finally, they do. Cleve catches up.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          Are they following in back?

          CLEVE JONES
          Yes. Where are we going?

          HARVEY MILK
          I don't know.
          (off Cleve's concern)
          We have to keep them moving.
          Exhaust them. March them till they
          drop. We can't have a riot tonight.
          Harvey LIFTS THE BULLHORN. He starts a marching chant. The
          crowd starts following along.
          JUMP TO: Gays glare at cops. Cops beat their nightsticks
          against their chests and power poles. Anger burns as Harvey
          marches the mob toward City Hall. Dick and Jim catch up.

          DICK PABICH
          They're still too hot in back.
          They'll burn the joint down.

          HARVEY MILK
          Help me turn them up Van Ness.
          We'll go all the way to Broadway.

          Dick heads back to try and wrangle the crowd. Harvey
          continues marching.

          61 EXT. CITY HALL - LATER THAT NIGHT

          Harvey arrives, the crowd still hot. Cops beat their
          nightsticks against their shields. Some jab protesters,
          trying to incite a fight. Anger burns.
          Harvey climbs the steps, his stage. He lifts his bullhorn.

          HARVEY MILK
          My name is Harvey Milk... And I
          want to recruit you.
          The CROWD ROARS APPROVAL.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          I am here tonight to say, we will
          no longer sit quietly in our
          closets. We must fight. Not just in
          the Castro, or San Francisco, but
          everywhere the Anitas go. Anita
          Bryant did not win tonight. Anita
          Bryant has brought us together...
          She is going to create a national
          gay force!
          (The crowd ROARS)
          And the young people in Richmond,
          Minnesota, or Jackson, Mississippi,
          or Woodmere, New York... Who are
          coming out and hearing Anita Bryant
          on television telling them that
          they're wrong, they're sick, that
          there is no place for them in this
          great country, in this world...
          They're looking to us for something
          tonight...
          (his big moment, realizing
          his true mission)
          And I say, we have to give them
          hope!

          Harvey's suit is laid out. A record turns. Wagner blasts from
          the windows. Scott is folding his clothes into a box.

          HARVEY MILK
          Evelyn Lear's in town, at the Opera
          house in Tannhauser.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Clearly.

          HARVEY MILK
          What if she strolls into the Castro
          for a cocktail?
          (Scott keeps packing)
          Just one more. We can't let Rick
          Stokes take it.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Let Rick have it. Nobody thinks
          you're a fraud here, Harvey. You're
          not in New York, you're not a
          closet case asshole anymore. People
          respect you here. Relax for a year.
          Get us back on our feet.

          HARVEY MILK
          If people are ever going to take me
          seriously, I have to win this one.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Since when did you care if anyone
          took you seriously?

          HARVEY MILK
          Anita wants to put us all back in
          concentration camps. Rick Stokes is
          too weak to beat her back if she
          gets to California. I have to be in
          office to protect us from them.

          

          

          

          

          41.

          SCOTT SMITH
          I can't do another one.
          (Harvey says nothing)
          I'll be back for my sheets. If
          you're not here, I'll see you in
          the shop next week.
          Scott picks up his box of clothes and starts out of the
          apartment. Harvey, not meaning a word:

          HARVEY MILK
          If you leave me right now... I can
          find someone new.

          SCOTT SMITH
          I know. You're a catch.
          Scott leaves. Harvey is in shock, unable to comprehend the
          loss. Unable/unwilling to reverse the choice he's made.

          69 INT. CASTRO CAMERA - DAY

          The ENTOURAGE is completely caught up in the new campaign
          (Cleve, Jim, Dick, and newcomer MICHAEL WONG, 23, asexual and
          devoutly political). Harvey is RANTING, ripping down an
          Assembly campaign poster.

          HARVEY MILK
          --Ring out the old, ring in the
          new. This is over. Done. I don't
          want to see anything that say's
          fucking Assembly. This three-time
          loser faggot is running for
          Supervisor goddamn it!
          ANNE KRONENBERG, 23, parks her motorcycle outside, WALKS INTO
          THE CAMERA SHOP, and plants herself behind HARVEY'S DESK.
          Cleve, Mike, Jim and Dick are STARING at Anne.

          JIM RIVALDO
          Who the heck is she?

          HARVEY MILK
          (suddenly cool)
          Our new campaign manager. She
          called last week to volunteer and I
          asked her to help.

          DICK PABICH
          Help or take over? What about Scott?

          HARVEY MILK
          We need new blood.
          (introducing them)

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          42.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          Guys... Anne Kronenberg.
          (Off their puzzled looks)
          She's a woman... A woman who likes
          women. Odd, isn't it?

          ANNE KRONENBERG
          Hi guys. Mr. Milk... Rick Stokes
          isn't pulling out. He's officially
          filed to run against you. My friend
          at The Advocate says David
          Goodstein is backing him.

          MICHAEL WONG
          A gay candidate against a gay
          candidate. It's unfortunate.

          JIM RIVALDO
          They'll split the gay vote. The
          straights will divide and conquer.

          HARVEY MILK
          Try to find out when they're going
          to announce.

          DICK PABICH
          You replaced Scott with a lesbian?

          HARVEY MILK
          Anne worked on a recycling campaign
          up North. She's very organized.

          JIM RIVALDO
          How do you know she's not a plant
          from Rick Stokes' campaign?

          ANNE KRONENBERG
          Are you guys always this paranoid?

          MICHAEL WONG
          Yes. They take after Harvey.

          HARVEY MILK
          Shouldn't you be doing someone's
          laundry?

          MICHAEL WONG
          Right after you redecorate my house.

          ANNE KRONENBERG
          (pointed at Jim Rivaldo)
          Sir, my girlfriends say you guys
          don't like women. Just asking, is
          there a place for us in all this,
          or are you scared of girls?

          

          

          

          

          43.

          HARVEY MILK
          Gentleman, we already have a tinker
          bell, a lotus-blossom, Jim and Dick
          in your three-piece suits. We need
          someone to manage things. A woman
          this time. She's the right price, and
          she has bigger balls than any of you.

          ANNE KRONENBERG
          Just give me whatever's left over in
          the register at the end of the day.
          So should I call the Chronicle about
          getting US an endorsement? No?
          OFF the group of misfits, considering the addition.

          69B INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE A LECTURE HALL - NIGHT

          PAN OFF: a large "RICK STOKES, SUPERVISOR DISTRICT 5" poster
          to reveal Anne Kronenberg outside the hall handing "MILK"
          signs to a long line of gathering women and lesbians who are
          filing in.
          Flanked by a PEEVED AID, Rick Stokes rushes out of the
          lecture hall and confronts Anne.

          RICK STOKES
          Young lady, you must be confused.
          This is my night, not Mr. Milk's.

          ANNE KRONENBERG
          (as pleasant as can be)
          No, sir. I'm Harvey's new campaign
          manager. Anne Kronenberg.

          RICK STOKES
          Then you should know this race is
          for District 5, the Castro, not for
          all of your lesbian... compadres--
          A tough lesbian kisses Anne and stares Rick down as she heads
          in. Rick looks uncomfortable around all these women.

          ANNE KRONENBERG
          I'm sorry. Are we distracting you,
          Mr. Stokes? I'd hate to screw you
          up on your big night.
          Dick runs up looking for more fliers. Taking Rick even more
          off his game, Dick is flirtatious.

          DICK PABICH
          Hi Rick, handsome suit. Annie, do
          you have any more hand cards?

          

          

          

          

          44.

          RICK STOKES
          These people are not from this
          area. They need to leave. Now.

          DICK PABICH
          Not true. Guess where we found them
          all, Rick? A slew of them. Way up
          on Valencia Street. Living right
          there in our district. And you see,
          as it turns out, Annie here is
          very, very popular with the ladies.
          Dick puts his arm around Anne. Rick is stupefied.

          70 EXT. SF STREET - DAY

          Dozens of supporters hold "MILK for Supervisor" signs in a
          long line along Market St. waving to commuters. Anne walks
          the long line, handing out new signs to arriving volunteers.
          Harvey is handing out FLYERS. He is exhausted, his throat is
          RAW. The campaign is nearly over.
          A WEIRD MOMENT: A BOY walks up to Harvey and hands him a
          flier. ALL SOUND GOES DEAD ON THE SOUNDTRACK as HARVEY'S EYES
          lock into the BOY'S EYES.
          Harvey reads the FLIER: â€œUnite and Fight for Dan White.â€�
          Harvey looks back to pat the BOY'S head, but he's gone. He
          looks to the sidewalk for the kid... a parent... nothing...

          71 INT. CASTRO CAMERA - NIGHT

          Harvey is still looking at the flier. Anne is leaving with a
          stack of SF Chronicles. Cleve comes in, pulls one off her
          stack, and looks for "the article."

          HARVEY MILK
          They've accused me of many things,
          but never as blatant a lie as this.

          ANNE KRONENBERG
          First ever newspaper endorsement.

          CLEVE JONES
          (reading the article)
          They endorsed you for being a good
          businessman? Has Scott read this?
          He'll piss himself.

          HARVEY MILK
          Yeah? Go show him.
          (Cleve starts to go)

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          45.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          Cleve, maybe you should go find a
          boy to celebrate with. Just in
          case.

          CLEVE JONES
          I'm going to The Stud. Meet me out.
          Cleve goes. His energy is boundless. Harvey sits alone
          watching the bargoers return home through his front window. A
          bitter-sweetness lingers. A couple waves, one shouts out:

          GAY MAN
          Gonna win this time, Milk?
          They walk on, not waiting for an answer.
          Then, a drunk, cute, Latino, JACK LIRA, 25, stops. He stares
          in at the political ads in the window. Harvey watches him
          sway drunk out of his mind, waiting for him to fall. The two
          make eye contact. Harvey smiles. Jack tries to. Harvey picks
          up a folding chair and walks it out to him.

          JACK LIRA
          (re: poster in the window)
          You're more handsome in the
          posters.

          HARVEY MILK
          Thank you. Where do you live?

          JACK LIRA
          (too drunk to hear, flirting)
          ...Palomino's are my favorite
          horse. They're smart. They're
          fast and compact. Do you think I'm
          more like a Palomino or a Stallion?
          Jack smiles, out of his mind. Then he sits/falls down into
          the chair, and slides off. Harvey stands above the passed out
          young man. A newcomer. A wounded bird. Perfect.

          72 INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Completely nude, Jack plays a tantalizing game of seduction,
          allowing Harvey to hold him, then wriggling away... Dancing
          against Harvey then BITING his shoulder... LYING on the bed,
          then ROLLING away when Harvey tries to hold him...
          No TALK. No POLITICS. Just SEX. A perfect RELEASE for
          Harvey.

          73 INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

          Harvey holds Jack after lovemaking.

          

          

          

          

          46.

          JACK LIRA
          My father beat me when he found
          out... So I came here. I stay in this
          man's house. But I don't like him.

          HARVEY
          Shh, it's okay, now. No one's ever
          going to beat you again.
          A long, comforting beat between them.

          JACK LIRA
          I love you.

          HARVEY
          (smiles, playful)
          Do you even remember my name?
          (a beat, Jack shakes his
          head, he can't remember)
          Harvey.

          JACK LIRA
          I love you, Harvey.

          74 INT. VOTING BOOTH - DAY

          HARVEY stands in a voting booth. He goes down the list of
          names. He finally punches the one next to "HARVEY MILK"
          District 5, and pulls the lever. The chads fall.

          HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
          And for the first time in my life,
          it all came together... the union
          boys, the women, the seniors, the
          minorities... All of the us's
          showed up...

          75 EXT. CASTRO CAMERA - ELECTION NIGHT

          TV lights blast Castro Camera. A raucous crowd pours into the
          streets to greet the roar of motorcycles. Anne pulls up with
          the Sheriff on back. Harvey is passenger on a second bike.
          HARVEY IS VICTORIOUS! He is instantly swarmed.

          76 INT. CASTRO CAMERA - LATER

          The Shop is packed. It's a giant celebration party. Anne and
          Cleve are working the door. SCOTT SMITH WATCHES FROM THE
          CROWD OUTSIDE THE SHOP as Rick Stokes and David Goodstein try
          to get in.

          RICK STOKES
          We just want to congratulate him.

          

          

          

          

          47.

          CLEVE JONES
          I'm sorry. We're all full.

          DAVID GOODSTEIN
          (seeing Harvey inside)
          Harvey! Harvey!

          HARVEY MILK
          It's too crowded. Sorry!
          JACK LIRA shoves his way toward the door...

          JACK LIRA
          Harvey!
          Harvey PULLS JACK INSIDE, right past Goodstein and Stokes.
          Harvey CATCHES A GLIMPSE OF SCOTT OUTSIDE...

          HARVEY MILK
          Scottie--?
          But Scott fades into the CROWD. Harvey (with Jack at his
          side) is pulled back into the party.

          CLEVE JONES
          (eyeing Jack skeptically)
          The new Mrs. Milk. I give it a
          week.

          JACK LIRA
          (the crowd)
          Harvey, is this all for you? Are
          you this famous?

          HARVEY MILK
          No, darling. We do this all the
          time. Do you like it?
          Jim is calling out NAMES of the OTHER WINNERS.

          JIM RIVALDO
          Carol Ruth Silver... Gordon Lau...
          It's the most liberal Board in
          years!

          HARVEY MILK
          What about Dan White? Did he win?

          JIM RIVALDO

          (YES)
          We'll deal with him tomorrow.
          Harvey is DOUSED with champagne.

          

          

          

          

          48.
          JUMP TO: Harvey is interviewed by a TV REPORTER. Jack
          squeezes his way under Harvey's arm and into the picture.

          CHANNEL 5 REPORTER
          Does this mean, as many straights
          are concerned, maybe the gays are
          taking over San Francisco? Are you
          going to be a Supervisor for all
          the people?

          HARVEY MILK
          I have to be. That's what I was
          elected for. I have to be there to
          open up the dialogue for the
          sensitivities of all people, all
          their problems, the problems that
          effect this city effect all of us.
          (toasts the camera)
          Thank you San Francisco! Thank you!

          77 EXT. MARKET STREET MONTAGE - DAY - JAN 1978

          SET TO MUSIC: In his old brown suit, Harvey walks to City
          Hall with a crowd of supporters. The familiar faces now
          include Jack Lira.

          78 EXT. CITY HALL - DAY

          On City Hall's steps, Mayor Moscone swears in HARVEY.

          HARVEY MILK
          I, Harvey Milk, do solemnly swear
          that I will support and defend the
          Constitution of the United States
          and the Constitution of the State
          of California against all enemies,
          foreign and domestic; and that I
          will well and faithfully discharge
          the duties upon which I am about to
          enter and during such time as I
          hold the office of Supervisor, City
          and County of San Francisco.
          Bulbs FLASH. A light rain begins to fall. Umbrellas go up.

          HARVEY MILK(CONT'D)
          Anita Bryant said gay people
          brought the drought to California.
          Looks to me like it's finally
          started raining!
          Cheers. Harvey is emboldened.

          

          

          

          

          49.

          79 INT. SCOTT'S APARTMENT / TV SET - MORNING

          Off a TV in Scott's NEW APARTMENT, we see a S.F. Morning show
          featuring new Supervisors, Harvey Milk and Dan White.

          HOST (ON TV)
          This will be the first time in many
          years that we've seen so many new
          faces on the Board of Supervisors.
          Do you think such diversity will
          cripple the Board?

          HARVEY MILK (ON TV)
          The name of the game on the Board
          is six votes to get anything
          passed. So, like it or not, Dan
          and I are now in bed together...
          politically speaking.
          THE CAMERA REVEALS SCOTT watching the program. He's been up
          all night.

          DAN WHITE (ON TV)
          I've assured Harvey here that my
          brochure's comments about "social
          deviants" referred more to junkies
          than to his people. See, I'm about
          to have my first child. I have to
          make sure this city remains a
          decent place to raise him.

          80 INT. TELEVISION STATION - MOMENTS LATER

          The segment over, sound assistants help Harvey and Dan remove
          their microphones. Harvey tries to draw Dan in:

          HARVEY MILK
          How long were you a fireman, Dan?

          DAN WHITE
          A couple of years.

          HARVEY MILK
          And before that... You were a
          police officer?
          Dan studies Harvey suspiciously... What's his point?

          DAN WHITE
          You have something against cops?

          HARVEY MILK
          No. They tend to have something

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          (seeing Dan react uncomfortably)
          But firefighters. Now those are true
          heroes... They supported me in the
          last campaign. I support them fully.

          DAN WHITE
          I appreciate it.

          HARVEY MILK
          I meant what I said. I'd like to
          work together.
          Dan hesitantly accepts Harvey's handshake. It's a step.

          DAN WHITE
          (cracking a smile)
          I'll see you at the office, Mr.
          Milk.

          81 INT. CITY HALL - DAY

          Harvey goes through the metal detectors at the entrance and
          finds Cleve in a NEW SUIT waiting for the elevator.

          HARVEY MILK
          What do you think of my new
          theater?

          CLEVE JONES
          A bit over the top.

          HARVEY MILK
          What's with the suit?

          CLEVE JONES
          I got it from a friend.
          Harvey leads Cleve from the elevator to the grand staircase.

          HARVEY MILK
          When you come here, I want you to
          wear the tightest jeans possible.
          Never blend in. And no elevators.
          Ever. Always take the stairs, you
          can make such a grand entrance
          going up the stairs.

          82 INT. CITY HALL / SUPERVISORS' OFFICES - MOMENTS LATER

          Harvey leads Cleve down the hall of Supervisors' offices,
          passing Dianne Feinstein's open door.

          HARVEY MILK
          And street talk only around
          Feinstein. Shit, goddamn, fuck,

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          all that. It bugs the hell out of
          her.
          They arrive at his Lead Aide's desk: it's Anne Kronenberg.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          Morning Annie, let's set Cleve up
          on mail.

          ANNE KRONENBERG
          Will do.

          HARVEY MILK
          Come into my office...

          83 INT. CITY HALL / HARVEY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

          Harvey walks in. Michael and Jim are in a strategy session.

          HARVEY MILK
          The first order of business that
          will come out of this office is a
          city wide Gay Rights Ordinance.
          Just like the one Anita shot down
          in Dade County. What do you think,
          Lotus Blossom?

          MICHAEL WONG
          I think it's good. Not great.

          HARVEY MILK
          Then make it brilliant. I want
          Anita's attention here. In San
          Francisco. I want her to bring her
          fight to US... This Bill needs a
          unanimous vote. We need headlines.

          JIM RIVALDO
          Dan White won't vote for this.
          Harvey puts his fingers to his lips and points down the hall,
          indicating Dan is down there. Harvey whispers:

          HARVEY MILK
          Dan's fine. He's just uneducated.
          We can teach him.
          Dan pops his head into Harvey's office.

          DAN WHITE
          Harvey, committee meets at 9:30.
          Oh, hi Michael, Jim.
          (to Harvey)
          Hey, did you get the invitation to

          52.

          DAN WHITE (CONT'D)
          my son's christening? I invited a
          few of the other supes as well.

          HARVEY MILK
          I'll be there.

          DAN WHITE
          Great!
          All smiles, Dan leaves. Cleve mocks him. OFF Mike Wong's
          expression: THAT WAS BIZARRE.

          ANNE KRONENBERG
          Are you going?

          HARVEY MILK
          Hey. I'll let him christen me, if
          he'll vote for my Gay Rights
          Ordinance. We need allies. We need
          everyone.

          84 EXT. THE CASTRO - TWILIGHT

          The neighborhood is booming. Storefronts and sidewalks
          filled. This is not the rundown Castro that Harvey moved
          into 3 years ago.
          Harvey heads home, greeted by his PROUD CONSTITUENTS.
          He stops at the CAMERA SHOP when he notices a BROKEN WINDOW
          near the side entrance to his apartment.

          85 INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - TWILIGHT

          Harvey RUSHES UP THE STAIRS into his apartment and finds:
          JACK LIRA - Lighting a candle on the table which has been set
          for a lovely, romantic dinner.

          HARVEY
          Jack?

          JACK LIRA
          Welcome home, Harvey! I hope you're
          hungry. I only know how to cook one
          thing, but I make it good.

          HARVEY
          Did you... break in?

          JACK LIRA
          I asked the boy downstairs to let
          me in...

          HARVEY
          Danny?

          

          

          

          

          53.

          JACK LIRA
          He wouldn't let me in. So I came in
          this way. Your friends aren't very
          nice to me.

          HARVEY
          (avoiding the fight)
          I have a Town Hall meeting tonight,
          Jack.

          JACK LIRA
          You work too hard. I'm sorry about
          your window. I'll fix it tomorrow.
          (turning on the charm)
          Are you surprised?!

          HARVEY MILK
          Jack, I have to go. I have an
          invitation to a party tomorrow.
          Lots of rich people, politicians.
          We could get all dressed up...
          Jack turns up the music, takes Harvey's hands and guides him
          through a simple dance.

          JACK LIRA
          So I could be the first lady?

          HARVEY MILK
          Uh-huh.

          JACK LIRA
          I watched TV here today. All day. I
          saw All My Children. They killed
          Margo. I knew it was going to
          happen. They try and trick you but
          it never works.

          HARVEY MILK
          (enjoying this)
          You always see it coming?

          JACK LIRA
          What? Killing the blonde? Every
          time. I'm good with that.
          (gets slow, sensual)
          I think now the old lady is going
          to have an affair. Then she'll get
          killed or married. Always one or
          the other. Dead or married.
          Jack starts dancing with Harvey again. It's sweet, intimate.

          

          

          

          

          54.

          HARVEY MILK
          If I make you a key, you won't
          break my windows again, right?

          JACK LIRA
          That's right.
          The dance lesson is a lovely distraction. Harvey won't be
          going back to work tonight.

          86 INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - DAY

          Harvey watches water pour over an INFANT BOY. He tries hard
          to feel comfortable, but he's the only Jew, and likely the
          only gay man at Dan's child's baptism.
          Dan looks to Harvey, the proud father. Harvey waves.

          87 INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - LATER

          Harvey and Dan have pulled themselves away.

          HARVEY MILK
          I'm proposing a citywide ordinance.
          It ensures that a person who
          already has a job can't be fired
          for their orientation.

          DAN WHITE
          I'm not sure my constituents would
          favor that.
          Dan looks over to his WIFE and NEWBORN SON.

          HARVEY MILK
          Is anyone else here from the Board?

          DAN WHITE
          You're the only one who showed up I
          think.

          HARVEY MILK
          Were you christened here?

          DAN WHITE
          Yes. Right here. Same Parish. My
          grandma immigrated here when this
          was an Irish Catholic city. The
          City of St. Francis... A lot's
          changed here since then.

          HARVEY MILK
          You're more like one of us now...
          an outsider.

          

          

          

          

          55.

          DAN WHITE
          You're not like most homosexuals,
          are you, Harvey?

          HARVEY MILK
          Do you know a lot of "homosexuals?"

          DAN WHITE
          (smiles, then)
          Say, where do you stand on the
          Psychiatric Center the City's been
          pushing into my district?

          HARVEY MILK
          Well, I'd have to study it...

          DAN WHITE
          Getting it out of my district was a
          key piece of my platform. It only
          attracts arsonist, rapists, all
          that, you know.

          HARVEY MILK
          Sure, sure. A campaign promise.

          DAN WHITE
          A big one.

          (QUIET)
          What do you say we watch out for each
          other's interests? I'd like that.

          HARVEY MILK
          I'd like that, too, Dan.
          Mary Ann White approaches with their child. It's awkward, as
          if she's walked in on something intimate.

          DAN WHITE
          I'm sorry. Slipped into some shop
          talk.

          HARVEY MILK
          The Gay Rights Ordinance. My fault.

          MARY ANN WHITE
          Seems an inappropriate subject in
          here don't you think?

          HARVEY MILK
          Hey, don't knock it till you've
          tried it.
          His attempt to break the tension goes down in flames. She
          cracks a polite smile. They're from very different worlds.

          

          

          

          

          56.

          88 INT. HARVEY'S CITY HALL OFFICE - DAY

          Harvey is under pressure from his own advisors (Michael,
          Dick, Cleve) to vote against Dan's bill.

          DICK PABICH
          Supervisors Silver and Lau are
          asking you to vote to keep this
          Psychiatric Center in Dan's
          district. It'll go down 6 to 5 if
          you vote to get rid of it.

          MICHAEL WONG
          It's a Youth Campus, Harvey. These
          are kids that would be displaced
          from their families if it's moved.

          HARVEY MILK
          I can't just dump Dan. The guy's
          got nothing going for him. No
          friends...

          CLEVE JONES
          Here we go, Harvey to the rescue.
          Isn't it enough we have to put up
          with Jack?

          HARVEY MILK
          Lay off. He registered 120 voters
          last week.

          CLEVE JONES
          So do any of your volunteers, but
          you don't make them all first lady.

          MICHAEL WONG
          What does Dan White do for you?
          Really? Politically?

          HARVEY MILK
          He intrigues me... I think he may
          be one of us.
          Everyone groans. Cleve camps it up:

          CLEVE JONES
          Dear God, say it ain't so!

          HARVEY MILK
          It's just a theory...

          DICK PABICH
          You just think he's cute.

          

          

          

          

          57.

          HARVEY MILK
          No... I know what it's like to
          live that life. That lie. You can
          see it in Dan's eyes... The fear,
          the pressure...
          Anne Kronenberg walks in. She's got that look in her eyes.
          Something's up.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          Good or Bad?

          ANNE KRONENBERG
          Not great. State Senator John
          Briggs is Anita Bryant's go-to guy
          in California for sure. He's filed
          his petition for a statewide
          referendum to fire all gay teachers
          and anyone who supports them.
          A pall falls over the room. This is worse than expected.

          HARVEY MILK
          How many signatures will he need to
          qualify for the ballot?

          CLEVE JONES
          Whatever. He can get them in two
          Sundays at church in Orange County.

          HARVEY MILK
          (instead of fear,
          excitement bubbles up)
          This means the fight's coming here,
          where we can do something about it!
          Wichita's one thing, Kansas City.
          But Anita's heading for San
          Francisco! She's not going to know
          what hit her. Smile, children! This
          is the fight we've been waiting for.

          89 EXT. S.F. CITY HALL STEPS - DAY

          CA State Senator, JOHN BRIGGS, 47, delivers his message to
          the PRESS, THE TV CREWS, AND A MASS OF PROTESTERS.
          HARVEY AND HIS GROUP are amongst the crowd.

          JOHN BRIGGS
          My proposition promises to protect
          our children from these gay
          perverts and pedophiles who recruit
          our children to their deviant
          lifestyles, including the ones who

          do it in our public schools. It's
          time to root them out.
          In the crowd is teacher TOM AMMIANO, 36, colorful, worked up:

          TOM AMMIANO
          And how are you going to determine
          who's a homosexual?

          JOHN BRIGGS
          Sir, my bill outlines procedures
          for identifying homosexuals.

          ANOTHER PROTESTER
          How? Will you be sucking them off?

          JOHN BRIGGS
          Sir, you can argue with me, but you
          cannot argue with God.
          It's getting ugly fast. Briggs is whisked away by TWO
          OFFICERS. He trips off the curb and is quickly scooped up.

          90 INT. DAN WHITE'S HOME - DAY

          Dan's house is filled with RELATIVES for a birthday
          celebration. Dan is glued to the NEWS, watching BRIGGS.
          Dan's RELATIVES gather around the TV. Mary Ann puts their
          BABY into Dan's arms and returns to wrangling kids.

          THE COVERAGE CUTS TO HARVEY BEING INTERVIEWED:

          HARVEY MILK (ON TV)
          Look what happened in Germany. Now
          Anita Bryant already says that Jews
          and Muslims are going to hell, you
          know she's got a shopping list. We
          are not going to let John Briggs or
          Anita Bryant legislate bigotry in
          this city...
          Hold on Dan watching Harvey on TV.

          90B INT. UPSCALE SF HOUSE - NIGHT

          Cleve and Anne sit in the entry way, Cleve in his tight jeans
          and shirt. He's very out of place amongst all the suits.
          Harvey walks in. Cleve and Anne rush to his side. David
          Goodstein and Rick Stokes turn to greet Milk.

          DAVID GOODSTEIN
          Hello, Harvey. Running late?

          Oh Harvey... your boyfriend is in
          the closet.

          HARVEY MILK
          Excuse me, David?

          RICK STOKES

          (QUIETLY)
          The Latino, he's locked himself in
          the coat room... Mr. Milk, Phil
          Burton is here. He's likely the
          next Speaker of the House and a
          much needed ally against Prop Six.
          We don't need a scene.

          90C INT. UPSCALE S.F. HOUSE / COAT ROOM DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Harvey is at the door. Jack is locked inside the room.

           HARVEY MILK
          You're right, I know, I was late by
          twenty minutes. I'm sorry, Jack.

          JACK LIRA (O.S.)
          Who were you with? Scott? Some boy?

          HARVEY MILK
          I was at work. Come out, sugar pea.

          JACK LIRA (O.S.)
          No. You embarrassed me. I didn't
          know anyone. These are not good
          people. I don't want to be here.

          HARVEY MILK
          Then go home, Jack.

          JACK LIRA (O.S.)
          No. I'll wait for you. Go away.
          A tight smile from Harvey as he looks up to Cleve.

          91 INT. UPSCALE S.F. HOUSE / STUDY - LATER

          Harvey, Cleve and a dozen others are scattered about the room
          for a meeting with the DEMOCRATIC PARTY ESTABLISHMENT. U.S.
          Congressman PHIL BURTON, 51, leans on a desk, listening.

          DAVID GOODSTEIN
          The Briggs initiative is polling at
          75 percent for approval statewide.

          CLEVE JONES
          80 percent in other polls. Some
          even have us losing San Francisco.

          DAVID GOODSTEIN
          (condescending to Cleve)
          So it's important we not deceive
          people into thinking we can beat
          this, or we'll have riots and only
          increase this backlash.

          HARVEY JONES
          Good point, David. Let's just roll
          right over. Make it easier for
          Briggs to fuck us up the ass.
          Rick and David are horrified. Phil Burton rises above it,
          passing out copies of his new Anti-Briggs Initiative flier.

          PHIL BURTON
          We're taking this very seriously in
          my office. We want to send one of
          these to every home in California.
          We'll need money to do that.

          HARVEY MILK
          (reading the flier)
          "Proposition Six is an affront to
          Human Rights. An invasion of the
          State into the private lives of
          California citizens."
          (points to the pictures)
          Does it even say the word gay on
          this thing? Anywhere?

          DAVID GOODSTEIN
          No Harvey, purposefully not.

          PHIL BURTON
          With the heat bearing down on your
          movement right now, we think it's
          best to dodge the "gay" bullet. Go
          for the human rights angle.

          HARVEY MILK
          People need to know who's affected.
          This flier needs at least one old
          queen on it.
          (a dig, to Goodstein)
          Why don't you volunteer for that,
          David?

          RICK STOKES
          (an olive branch)
          Corey Wares is an out gay--

          

          

          

          

          61.

          DAVID GOODSTEIN
          (cutting Rick him off)

          RICK--

          HARVEY MILK
          This is shit. Shit and
          masturbation. It's a coward's
          response to a dangerous threat.

          DAVID GOODSTEIN
          (a beat, then)
          I think you should leave.
          In the face of Phil Burton, most the others seem to agree.
          HARVEY PUTS PHIL BURTON'S FLYER IN THE FIREPLACE on his way
          out of the room.

          91B INT. UPSCALE SF HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

          Harvey knocks on the coat check door.

          HARVEY MILK
          Jack, it's time to go.
          (to Cleve)
          Get everyone together. I want young
          people, women, fresh heads.
          Fighters and organizers, not
          politicians.

          CLEVE JONES
          (as if Jack can't spell)
          What about, S-C-O-T-T?
          OFF HARVEY, knowing Scott would be an asset. Jack opens the
          door and grabs Harvey's hand. They go.

          92 INT. CLEVE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Harvey's clan is assembled (Jim, Dick, Mike, Cleve, Anne,
          Jack, Denis) along with fiery teacher Tom Amiano and MANY

          OTHER YOUNG ACTIVISTS.
          A HANDSOME PIZZA DELIVERY GUY is setting down boxes of
          pizzas. They're in for the night. The atmosphere is 180
          degrees different from the previous stuffy meeting.

          CLEVE JONES
          We're not interested in working
          with those old Democratic Party
          shits.
          THE DOOR OPENS and someone new enters. He's HOLDING THE HAND
          OF... SCOTT SMITH. They are obviously a new couple.

          

          

          

          

          62.
          Scott and his BOYFRIEND find a place on the floor. Harvey's
          and Scott's EYES MEET across the room.

          JIM RIVALDO
          But we can't afford infighting
          anymore, Cleve. We have to bring
          together every group. Even the old
          school Democrats.

          HARVEY MILK
          (taking over)
          Is anybody gonna pay the pizza guy,
          or are we just gonna stare?
          People start chipping in for the HANDSOME PIZZA GUY.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          If we're gonna convince the 90% to
          give a shit about us 10%... We
          have to let 'em know who we are.
          (his big new idea)
          Everybody's coming out. The entire
          state. No matter where they live.

          DICK PABICH
          "Come out, come out, wherever you
          are!"

          HARVEY MILK
          I'm serious.
          (beat, the room gets quiet)
          We're going to tell everyone in the
          state to come out. Every gay doctor,
          lawyer, teacher, dog catcher... We
          have to leave the ghetto, let all
          those people out there know that
          they do know one of us. And if
          people won't step out of the closet,
          we open the door for them.

          ANNE KRONENBERG
          Jesus.

          SCOTT SMITH
          The whole state is not San Francisco.

          HARVEY MILK
          Clearly, Scott.

          JIM RIVALDO
          It could be dangerous. There is
          such a thing as a right to privacy.

          

          

          

          

          63.

          HARVEY MILK
          Privacy's our enemy. You want real
          political power? Let's tell the
          truth for a change. Starting here.
          If there's anybody in this room,
          right now, who hasn't told their
          families, their friends, their
          employers... Do it. Now.

          ANNE KRONENBERG
          My folks know already.
          A beat. The room is silent. Dick looks ill.

          DICK PABICH
          I haven't told my father yet...

          HARVEY MILK
          (a beat, then)
          People vote two to one for us if
          they know just one of us.

          (BEAT)
          Cleve, show Dick where you keep
          your phone.

          CLEVE JONES
          It's in the bedroom.
          After a moment, Dick RISES and follows Cleve out of the room.
          People are stunned by Harvey's outrageous demand. Harvey sees
          Scott GLARING at him.

          93 EXT. CLEVE'S APARTMENT / STAIRCASE - LATER

          The meeting is breaking up, and Scott lets his NEW BOYFRIEND
          go ahead. Harvey ducks away from Jack and intercepts Scott.

          HARVEY MILK
          I thought you were done with
          politics.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Politics. Not the movement. What
          the hell was that in there?

          HARVEY MILK
          The movement needs people to be up-
          front. Why were you fighting me?

          SCOTT SMITH
          You were the biggest closet case
          alive in New York. You told me and
          all your boyfriends to keep our

          64.

          SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D)
          traps shut. You were the hypocrite
          in there.

          HARVEY MILK
          My parents are gone. My brother
          knows. I'm sure they knew.

          SCOTT SMITH
          I had to listen to your phone calls
          home to Mom. Hear you deny that I
          existed. You want to be "normal" as
          bad as any of us. More than any of
          us... Those are kids in there.
          You're asking them to lose their
          families.

          HARVEY MILK
          If their families won't love them
          for who they are, who they really
          are, then they should lose them.

          SCOTT SMITH
          That's fucking insane.

          HARVEY MILK
          (re: Scott's new Boyfriend)
          Who's he? Do you live together?

          SCOTT SMITH
          Someone I'm seeing. He's good for
          me. He makes me stay home at
          nights, out of the bars...

          HARVEY MILK
          (quietly, so Jack doesn't hear)
          I miss you.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Oh, Harvey, don't...
          (eyeing Jack down the street)
          What's that about?

          JACK LIRA
          (calling out)
          Har-veyyyyy!

          HARVEY MILK
          He needs me.
          Scott nods. THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN HARVEY'S ACHILLES HEAL.
          He walks away from Harvey, leaving him alone.

          

          

          

          

          65.

          94 INT. CITY HALL / SUPERVISORS' CHAMBERS - DAY

           Dianne bangs her gavel like a mad woman. Harvey's adamant.

          HARVEY MILK DIANNE FEINSTEIN
          I have told no lies here Supervisor Milk, you will
          today or to Supervisor White come to order.
          in the past--

           HARVEY MILK
          --I want it noted that I never
          promised to back moving any Mental
          Health Centers. I greatly respect
          Supervisor White, but I would like
          his remarks stricken.

          DIANNE FEINSTEIN
          Duly noted. We will take a recess
          before recording the vote.
          Fellow Supervisor, CAROL RUTH SILVER, leans over to Harvey.

          CAROL RUTH SILVER
          Thank you, Harvey.
          Harvey is preoccupied with Dan approaching. He leans back.

          DAN WHITE
          Can I have a moment with Harvey?
          Alone, please, Carol?
          She politely recognizes the tension and gets up.

          DAN WHITE (CONT'D)
          Why are you turning on me like this
          at the last minute? What did I do?

          HARVEY MILK
          I didn't have all the details. I'll
          help you craft a different version
          that doesn't displace any kids.

          DAN WHITE
          Harvey, I can't go back to my family
          and to my folks and to my district
          without this. Don't do this.

          HARVEY MILK
          I'm getting a lot of pressure, Dan.

          DAN WHITE
          You strung me along. And now you're
          throwing me to the wolves.

          

          

          

          

          66.

          HARVEY MILK
          You only need one more vote, Dan.
          There are 5 other Supervisors you
          could convince besides me.
          Dan grabs Harvey. It's threatening. A new side of Dan.

          DAN WHITE
          I'll vote against your Queer Law.
          I'll get Quentin against it.

          HARVEY MILK
          It'll still pass. You can't keep
          alienating yourself here, Dan.

          DAN WHITE
          I gave you a chance, Harvey. I
          really did. You blew it. You really
          blew it.
          Dan goes, the rage of a scorned adolescent under his suit.

          94A INT. FLASH FORWARD - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT

          Harvey's mood has darkened as he talks into his recorder...

          HARVEY MILK
          Across the country, a handful of
          city councils had passed the very
          first ordinances protecting gay
          people against discrimination. But
          Anita Bryant and her right wing
          Christian fundamentalists were
          creating and exploiting and fanning
          a backlash. Now she had referenda
          to repeal all of these gay rights
          ordinances. While we were preparing
          for the battle against Briggs and
          Prop Six, Anita Bryant was taking
          her show on the road... sweeping
          the country. Her next stop was
          Wichita, Kansas.

          95 INT. TV NEWS REPORTS - NIGHT

          CHYRON: "Landslide: Wichita says NO to Gays." Anita talks to
          a REPORTER. BRIGGS is among the supporters at her side.

          ANITA BRYANT
          I give thanks for all of our foot
          soldiers of God here in Wichita.
          But we must push on. Look what
          happened to Sodom and to the world
          of Noah. Onward Christian soldiers!

          96 I/E. TELEPHONE TREE MONTAGE / EFFECT - DAY
          A telephone tree MONTAGE starts with Cleve on a PAY PHONE on
          Castro Street:

          CLEVE JONES
          Hi. We're losing Wichita. Rally
          tonight. Sundown. Market and Castro.
          A MULTIPLYING FRAME EFFECT: the person he called calls two
          others, they call four, then more and more as the tree grows.

          98 INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - THAT NIGHT

          HARVEY'S POV ON: The VIOLENT DEATH THREAT LETTER AND DRAWING
          that is still tacked up to his refrigerator.
          OUTSIDE: The SOUNDS of a RIOT in the making.
          Harvey rips down the threatening LETTER and throws it away.

          99 INT. CAMERA SHOP - CONTINUOUS

          Harvey BOUNDS down the stairs and into the shop. Cleve RUSHES
          into the store, breathless.

          CLEVE JONES
          They're moving. I don't know
          where, but...

          HARVEY MILK
          Did Jim call the press?
          (shouting at Danny)
          Get out there with your camera!

          DANNY NICCOLETTA
          I'm going!

          CLEVE JONES
          Press is covered. But we don't have
          a permit to march.

          HARVEY MILK
          (digs for his bullhorn)
          When I got Coors out of the bars,
          the Union gave me this. I want you
          to have it.

          CLEVE JONES
          What do I do with this?

          

          

          

          

          68.

          HARVEY MILK
          You're an activist. Take it. March
          them.
          (off Cleve, unsure)
          March those people up to the front
          doors of City Hall. When it looks
          really bad, the city's first gay
          Supervisor will come out and play
          peacemaker. We save the city from a
          riot. We can turn this night into
          more political power for the cause.

          CLEVE JONES
          I can't do it like you do it.

          HARVEY MILK
          I won't always be here. Somebody
          else will have to take over.
          (looking him in the eye)
          I need you to be the scary one now.

          100 EXT. CASTRO AND MARKET STREET - NIGHT

          A massive, angry crowd has gathered. Baby-faced Cleve takes a
          makeshift stage. He lifts the bullhorn and with nerves, reads
          a speech. Its pages blow about.
          CLEVE'S POV: Harvey watches from afar. Encouraging him.

          CLEVE JONES
          Forty years ago tonight, the gay
          citizens of Germany found out they
          no longer had civil rights.
          Tomorrow morning, the gay citizens
          of Wichita will also awaken to find
          that they too have lost their civil
          rights. You have whistles. You use
          them when we have been attacked.
          Tonight we have been attacked.
          Initially Cleve is successful, but then the crowd turns,
          marching toward City Hall without him.

          CLEVE JONES(CONT'D)
          Fuck. Shit. Harvey!
          Cleve runs as fast as he can to cut through the crowd, to get
          to the front. He gets on his walkie-talkie.

          CLEVE JONES (CONT'D)
          Get the press to the overpass!
          ON HARVEY: Ducking through EMPTY STREETS, trying to get AHEAD
          OF THE CROWD and beat them to City Hall.

          

          

          

          

          69.
          Cleve gets to the head of the crowd.

          CLEVE JONES (CONT'D)
          Move... Left... Move... Left...

          JIM RIVALDO
          (charging up)
          What are you doing? Where's Harvey?

          CLEVE JONES
          We're shutting down traffic, both
          directions.
          Cleve looks up at the press that's arrived on the overpass
          above, and turns to two HIPPIE KIDS near the front.

          CLEVE JONES(CONT'D)
          Disconnect the power arms!
          The boys climb up a trolley and knock down the power arms.
          Sparks fly. Brakes squeal. The press snaps photos.

          100B INT. CASTRO STREET BAR - NIGHT

          The angry protesters march past the large glass windows of
          TWIN PEAKS bar. Unlike the Dade County march, the bar is
          empty. The patrons are already in the streets.

          101 INT. CITY HALL - LATER

          Harvey RACES to his office. He stops at a mirror to
          straighten his tie and collect himself.
          OUTSIDE: The SOUND of the ANGRY MOB on City Hall's front
          steps. "Civil Rights or Civil War!" Someone THROWS A ROCK at
          the City Hall doors.
          Harvey rushes out the front doors, pushing past the police to
          greet THE MOB on City Hall's front steps. Through the glass
          doors we see Cleve rush up and hand Harvey his bullhorn:

          HARVEY MILK
          Hello. My name is Harvey Milk, and
          I want to recruit you.
          (AN ENORMOUS CHEER rises)
          I want to recruit you for the fight
          to preserve our democracy against
          the Anita Bryants and John Briggs
          who are trying to legalize bigotry!
          We have a choice to make. The fight
          is at our doors. We must either go
          back in the closet and shut it
          tight, or fight... History shows

          that if we continue to fight, we...
          will... win.

          101B INT. CITY HALL / HARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

          Jim, Dick, Anne, Michael, Frank and Cleve are all in the
          office. The FRONT PAGE of the Examiner features a PICTURE OF
          CLEVE AND HARVEY ARM IN ARM on City Hall's steps. Cleve is
          jazzed. Harvey stews.

          CLEVE JONES
          They're calling it a "successful
          mediation." You're a God damn hero.
          Fuck. It came this close to a riot.

          HARVEY
          Lose the note cards next time. Your
          job is just to say into that
          bullhorn what they're all feeling.

          CLEVE JONES
          You're just jealous it wasn't you
          out there.

          HARVEY MILK
          We're losing Prop Six by 60% and
          you're over there celebrating a
          riot. I need more visibility...
          (the real problem:)
          If we're going to beat this thing,
          we have to get Briggs to
          acknowledge us.
          Harvey steps away, hot, pensive. Anne gets quiet.

          ANNE KRONENBERG
          Every paper's calling Prop Six the
          main event now. We lose this, we'll
          have anti-gay laws in all fifty
          states, and Briggs won't return our
          calls for a public debate.

          DICK PABICH
          He's ignoring us to death.

          HARVEY MILK
          (steaming back in)
          We need something populist. What's
          the number one complaint about city
          life?

          CLEVE JONES
          The piss smell in the Tenderloin.

          

          

          

          

          71.

          HARVEY MILK
          Close.

          FRANK ROBINSON
          Dog shit.

          JIM RIVALDO
          If you cleaned up all the dog shit
          in the city, you could be elected
          Mayor.

          CLEVE JONES
          "Mayor Milk."

          HARVEY MILK
          I like it.

          104 EXT. SF SIDEWALKS - DAY

          Cleve searches frantically for something... He SEES a pile of
          DOG POOP. He scoops it up and runs it back to City Hall's
          front lawn and plants it in the grass.

          105 EXT. CITY HALL / FRONT LAWN - MOMENTS LATER

          IN THE VERY SAME SPOT CLEVE JUST WAS: Harvey with a clump of
          REPORTERS, a red and white "No on 6" button pinned to his
          lapel (HENCEFORTH, IT'S A FIXTURE).

          HARVEY MILK
          Dog mess is a hazard, and on top of
          that, it's disgusting. Under the
          ordinance, dog owners that don't
          clean up can be fined. This really
          is the bottom line!
          He smiles at his own joke, punctuating it by "accidentally"
          stepping in Cleve's well-placed dog shit. A BIG grin. BULBS
          FLASH. These flashes transition into:

          106 INT. CITY HALL / SUPERVISORS' CHAMBERS - DAY

          HARVEY STUDIES HIS OWN PHOTO on the FRONT PAGE of the
          Chronicle, making his announcement about dog poop.
          The SUPERVISORS are assembled for a vote. The CLERK, 60,
          wraps up his roll call

          CLERK
          Supervisor Lau?

          GORDON LAU
          Aye.

          

          

          

          

          72.

          CLERK
          Lau, Aye. Supervisor Silver?

          CAROL RUTH SILVER
          Aye.

          CLERK
          Silver, Aye. Supervisor White?

          DAN WHITE
          No.

          CLERK
          White, No. Madam President, I have
          ten ayes and one no.
          Dianne Feinstein BANGS HER GAVEL down hard.

          DIANNE FEINSTEIN
          The San Francisco Gay Rights
          Ordinance sponsored by Supervisors
          Milk and Silver is passed.

          CAMERA'S FLASH! THE PACKED CHAMBERS ROAR!
          Harvey locks onto Dan White. Dan makes eye contact. Harvey
          turns his attention to the chamber audience's applause.

          107 INT. CITY HALL / MAYOR MOSCONE'S OFFICE - DAY

          A gaggle of press has congregated. Mayor Moscone and Harvey
          walk into the office keeping their conversation private.

          MAYOR MOSCONE
          I can't get my stories on page ten,
          you're getting page one?

          HARVEY MILK
          Doggy-doo's a real problem, George.
          With a shit eating grin, Harvey offers up a powder blue pen.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          Powder blue to sign they city's
          first Gay Rights law... George, we
          need your help with Briggs... The
          gay community will have your back
          from now on. On all issues. I hope
          you'll have ours.
          A beat between them. An alliance is forming. The Mayor sits
          behind his desk and turns to the press with Harvey's pen.

          

          

          

          

          73.

          MAYOR MOSCONE
          Good morning, everyone... I don't
          do this enough, taking swift and
          unambiguous action on a substantive
          move for civil rights.
          Moscone signs the law with the powder blue pen. Harvey leans
          over him. THE PRESS CAPTURES THE MOMENT.

          107A INT. DAN WHITE'S OFFICE - DAY

          Dan sits at his desk, agitated. DAN'S POV: The FRONT PAGE of
          the Examiner featuring MOSCONE AND HARVEY.
          Harvey comes to the door.

          HARVEY MILK
          What are you working on, Dan?

          DAN WHITE
          If you have something to discuss,
          you can have your aide make an
          appointment with my aide.

          HARVEY MILK
          Listen, I know you're disappointed
          about the Psychiatric Center...
          What else do you have coming up?

          DAN WHITE
          Now you need something from me.
          You want my me to join in with the
          Queers on this Prop Six business?

          HARVEY MILK
          We prefer the word "gay," Dan.
          Just as I'm sure you prefer the
          word, "Irish-American" to "Mick."

          DAN WHITE
          Harvey, our society can't exist
          without the family, without the
          church.

          HARVEY MILK
          We're not against those things.

          DAN WHITE
          You're not? Can two men reproduce?

          HARVEY MILK
          (a smile)
          No. But, we keep trying!

          (SERIOUSLY)

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          74.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          C'mon, Dan. You're channeling Anita
          and Briggs... we can work together.
          On something...

          DAN WHITE
          Okay. You introduce an initiative
          for Supervisor pay raises.

          HARVEY MILK
          (anything but that)
          It's a bad time politically. I have
          an election next year.

          DAN WHITE
          You asked for something. Introduce
          pay raises. I can't take care of
          my family on our salaries. You
          don't have that problem, do you?
          Dan's AIDE steps into the doorway. She seems surprised to see
          Harvey in Dan's office.

          DAN WHITE (CONT'D)
          Mr. Milk, You'll excuse me, I have
          a development meeting.
          Dan goes.

          108 INT. A SAN FRANCISCO HALL - NIGHT

          A crowd sings â€œHappy Birthday.â€� One after another, Harvey's
          guests throw CREAM PIES in his face. RICK AND DAVID GOODSTEIN
          INCLUDED. A PEACE OFFERING. Harvey wipes pie from his eyes.
          In the B.G. the black drag queen sensation, SYLVESTER, breaks
          into his top 10 anthem, "You Make Me Feel." It's a who's who
          of San Francisco's political elite. Jack scoots up to Harvey.

          HARVEY MILK
          What's wrong, Taco Bell?

          JACK LIRA
          Anne and Cleve tried to cut me out of
          your table. You should fire them.

          HARVEY MILK
          I'll take it under consideration.
          Why don't you get us a drink?
          A kiss and Jack heads to the bar. Scott approaches.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Don't let Cezar Chavez hear you
          calling him Taco Bell.

          

          

          

          

          75.

          HARVEY MILK
          He's getting better. He's enrolling
          in classes on Monday.
          Scott wipes PIE CREAM from Harvey's jacket.

          SCOTT SMITH
          I remember when your birthdays were
          a bit less... lavish. More
          intimate.

          HARVEY MILK
          Who invited you? Anne?

          SCOTT SMITH
          My boyfriend got an invitation. I
          was his "plus one."

          HARVEY MILK
          Congratulations. It was a tough
          ticket to get.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Congratulations to you. Looks like
          you're part of the Machine now.
          (Harvey looks away, toward Jack)
          You can do better.

          HARVEY MILK
          When I come home to Jack, I don't
          have to talk politics or talk
          intelligently. Or even talk.

          (SELF-DEPRECATING)
          And where's an old man like me
          going to get such a good looking
          young man, right?

          SCOTT SMITH
          You're not so old. You look
          handsome... Happy 48th. Looks like
          you're gonna make it to fifty after-
          all, Mr. Milk.
          Scott gives Harvey a BIRTHDAY KISS.

          109 INT. A SAN FRANCISCO HALL - LATER THAT NIGHT

          Harvey, still wearing cream pie remnants on his jacket, waits
          for Jack to come out of the rest room. Harvey's one of the
          last guests to leave. WAITERS are clearing tables.

          HARVEY'S POV DOWN A DIMLY LIT CORRIDOR: A MALE FIGURE
          APPROACHES, footsteps ECHOING on the marble floor. Harvey
          braces himself.

          

          

          

          

          76.
          Emerging from the shadows: DAN WHITE. He approaches Harvey
          with a bottle of Chivas.
          Dan is SUPER-FRIENDLY, as if nothing unpleasant has ever
          happened between them.

          DAN WHITE
          Sorry I missed the party, Harv...

          HARVEY MILK
          No problem, Dan. Good to see you.

          DAN WHITE
          Dog poop?

          HARVEY MILK
          Yeah.

          DAN WHITE
          It's good! It's a good one.

          HARVEY MILK
          Thanks. But it's a real problem.

          DAN WHITE
          Oh, yeah. I mean, God knows how many
          problems it causes. All kinds of
          diseases, birth defects probably, I
          mean, stuff you can't even...
          (drifting off, drunkenly)
          Hey, I got you a little something.

          HARVEY MILK
          You didn't have to--

          DAN WHITE
          (at the same time)
          You didn't have to--

          (LAUGHING)
          Why do people always say that?
          "You didn't have to?" I mean, of
          course, right? But, that's what
          they always say. They always say
          things like that...
          Dan's attempts to be witty and erudite (like Harvey) only
          leave him confused and tongue tied.
          Harvey HAS NO IDEA why Dan is here.

          HARVEY MILK
          Are you okay, Dan?

          

          

          

          

          77.

          DAN WHITE
          Oh, what? Yeah, sure. Harvey, I
          just... I just want to say...
          Happy Birthday.
          Dan PUTS HIS ARMS AROUND HARVEY for a sort-of macho but
          really weird birthday hug. Harvey stiffens, it's such a
          peculiar moment. Dan steps back, looks him over.

          DAN WHITE (CONT'D)
          I've really learned a lot from
          watching you, Harvey.

          HARVEY MILK
          I doubt that.

          DAN WHITE
          No, I have. You gotta get out
          there. Get noticed. That's how it
          works. But, you have an issue.
          That's your advantage.

          HARVEY MILK
          It's more than an issue, Dan.
          (a beat, one last try to
          get through to him)
          Dan. I've had four relationships in
          my life. Three of those four tried
          to kill themselves. I know it was
          my fault they did it. I told them
          to stay quiet. To hide. Most of my
          life I've been closeted. That's
          what living this life is like for
          most of us. The way things are...
          This isn't just about our jobs, or
          any issue, it's our lives we're
          fighting for.
          Jack emerges from the bathroom, barely together and leans on
          Harvey. Dan steps back from Harvey and Jack, his moment
          alone stolen away.

          DAN WHITE
          I've learned a lot from you,
          Harvey. I'm going to get my picture
          in the papers, too. You'll see.
          I've got my own issue. That's
          right. Dan White's Got An Issue!

          110 EXT. GAY FREEDOM DAY PARADE - DAY

          STOCK FOOTAGE: Along Market street: 375,000 people have shown
          up for the parade, many holding signs naming their hometowns:
          Newark, San Antonio, Lincoln.

          

          

          

          

          78.
          A MONTAGE: of the various marchers, floats, "Parents and
          Friends Of", high-camp drag queens, etc.
          Harvey sits on top of a car with a pink lei around his neck,
          a fistful of white flowers in one hand, and in the other, a
          hand written sign: "I'm from Woodmere, NY." To a news camera:

          HARVEY MILK
          Come out! Just come on out!
          DRIVING THE CAR: Anne keeps a close eye on the parade
          watchers. Any one of them could be an assassin.

          111 ON A STREET CORNER - DAN WHITE IS WITH A REPORTER:

          DAN WHITE
          I see naked men walking around,
          naked women walking around, which
          doesn't bother me as far as my
          personal standards of nudity, but
          it's not proper. We wouldn't allow
          it for any other parade in San
          Francisco, and it should not be
          allowed for the gay parade.

          112 EXT. GAY FREEDOM DAY PARADE / STAGE - LATER

           Just off stage. Anne hands him a typed postcard.

           ANNE KRONENBERG
          It came in the mail today.

          HARVEY MILK
          "You get the first bullet the minute
          you stand at the microphone."
          (looking for a silver lining)
          Looks like the publicity's working.

          ANNE KRONENBERG
          You don't have to go up there.

          HARVEY MILK
          It could happen any day, any night,
          any time...
          (off the ROARING CROWD
          that's waiting for him)
          The nation's eye is on us. I have
          to do this.
          JUMP TO: POV shots of cops and loners amongst the massive
          audience hint at Harvey's paranoia.
          Like diving off a cliff, Harvey launches up to the
          microphone. The deafening cheers surely would have drowned

          

          

          

          

          79.
          out gunfire, but when it fades, He's standing. He delivers
          his impassioned call to action:

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          My name is Harvey Milk, and I want
          to recruit you. I want to recruit
          you for the fight to preserve your
          democracy. Brothers and sisters, you
          must come out. Come out to your
          parents. I know that it is hard and
          will hurt them but think about how
          they will hurt you in the voting
          booth! Come out to your friends, if
          they indeed are your friends. Come
          out to your neighbors, to your
          fellow workers. Once and for all,
          break down the myths, destroy the
          lies and distortions. For your sake.
          For their sake. For the sake of the
          youngsters who are becoming scared
          by the votes from Dade to Eugene. On
          the Statue of Liberty it says "Give
          me your tired, your poor, your
          huddled masses yearning to be free."
          In the Declaration of Independence
          it is written "All men are created
          equal and are endowed with certain
          inalienable rights." For Mr. Briggs
          and Mrs. Bryant and all the bigots
          out there, no matter how hard you
          try, you cannot erase those words
          from the Declaration of
          Independence. No matter how hard you
          try, you cannot chip those words
          from off the base of the Statue of
          Liberty. That is what America is.
          Love it or leave it.
          Wild applause. He scans the crowd as he steps off stage. A
          bit surprised to still be alive. Cleve grabs him.

          CLEVE JONES
          The Mayor says Briggs is on his way
          here. He could intercept him for
          us. We could get him face to face.
          He couldn't ignore us anymore.

          HARVEY MILK
          Get the press.

          113 INT. LIMOUSINE / 5 BLOCKS FROM THE FREEDOM DAY PARADE - SAME

          John Briggs rides in a limo watching the â€œfreaks" outside. As
          he nears the Parade Stages his POLICE ESCORTS take an
          unplanned turn. He leans forward.

          

          

          

          

          80.

          JOHN BRIGGS
          The parade is the other direction.

          DRIVER
          They're taking us another way, Sir.

          114 INT. WAREHOUSE ON THE PIER - MOMENTS LATER

          The limo pulls in. Briggs cautiously steps out. Greeting him
          are Moscone, the POLICE CHIEF, 25 SFPD officers, a gaggle of
          press, and Harvey Milk.
          It's a showdown... HIGH NOON.

          JOHN BRIGGS
          I have a right to be here, Mr. Mayor.

          MAYOR MOSCONE
          I'm afraid it's not in the interest
          of your safety, or my public's
          safety to let you into that parade
          grounds.
          Finally face to face, Harvey extends his hand. Its a show for
          the FLASHING CAMERAS. Briggs is clearly uncomfortable.

          HARVEY MILK
          Hi, I'm Harvey Milk. It's quite an
          honor to meet you, Mr. Briggs.

          JOHN BRIGGS
          I'm aware. Sad you're too afraid to
          fight this out in public, Mr. Milk.

          HARVEY MILK
          No sir. I would love to have a
          public debate. I'm very interested
          in the details of your argument.

          JOHN BRIGGS
          You know the details. As do the
          people. Look at the votes across this
          nation. The "public" is with me.

          HARVEY MILK
          Yes sir, today they are. But with my
          City's Mayor and the San Francisco
          press as my witnesses, I'm
          challenging you to a public debate.
          John nods, stiff. He can no longer avoid Harvey Milk. He gets
          back in his limo.

          

          

          

          

          81.

          INT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT - (ON TV) 115

          Harvey sits with John Briggs at a table facing forward. We
          hear the cheers and jeers of the packed audience.

          HARVEY MILK
          Senator, as a Christian it's
          interesting that you don't seem to
          understand what Christ was about.
          He was about accepting people and
          giving love, not carrying a Bible
          in one hand and hatred in the
          other...
          (cheers from the audience)
          ...Now all the gay myths have been
          shattered, all the fears, all the--

          JOHN BRIGGS
          Not in my mind they haven't--

          HARVEY MILK
          That's it. In your mind they
          haven't, and I'm wondering why--

          JOHN BRIGGS
          Mr. Milk, we don't allow people who
          believe in practicing bestiality to
          teach our children, and the reason
          we don't is because it is illegal.
          But it's not illegal to be a
          homosexual in California.

          HARVEY MILK
          And your law goes even further. Any
          school employee who even supports a
          gay person will be fired--

          JOHN BRIGGS
          True. But, gay people don't have
          children of their own. If they
          don't recruit our children, they'd
          all die away. That's why they want
          to be teachers, to encourage our
          children to join them.

          HARVEY MILK (ON TV)
          How do you teach homosexuality?
          Like French? I was born of
          heterosexual parents, I was taught
          by heterosexual teachers in a
          fiercely heterosexual society. So
          then why am I homosexual? And no
          offense meant, but if it were true
          that children mimicked their

          teachers, you'd sure have a helluva
          lot more nuns running around.
          The audience eats it up. It feel like "The Harvey Milk Show."

          116 EXT. CITY HALL - DAY

          Briggs makes a STATEMENT to the press.

          JOHN BRIGGS
          If they're going to lead such an
          open life of homosexuality that
          they want a 21-gun salute every
          time somebody goes by them, those
          people are going to be in danger of
          being removed their job.

          116B INT. FLASH FORWARD - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT

          Continuing on with his recorded will...

          HARVEY MILK
          We were really genuinely frightened
          by Proposition Six, and with the
          backlash gaining strength, we were
          very pessimistic. We didn't think
          there was any chance we could beat
          it. What we hoped to do was to
          organize to the point that when we
          did lose, there would be a
          revolt... That all hell would break
          lose.

          117 INT. CITY HALL / HARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

          Harvey, pacing, decisive.

          DICK PABICH
          People are coming out, though. We
          met with groups in Bakersfield,
          Redding, a dozen people showed up
          in a library basement in Fresno
          asking for our support if they came
          out. Last Sunday, the Reverend of
          St. Mary's came out to his entire
          congregation...

          HARVEY MILK
          We're still losing, 60 to 30. We
          have to take the show on the road.
          Call Briggs's office. Do a press
          release. Tell them he can pick the
          town, the audience, and I'll ask
          our supporters not to attend.

          

          

          

          

          83.

          DICK PABICH
          Their audiences are insanely
          devout. We'll get killed.

          HARVEY MILK
          Get me Orange County.

          118 INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Jack is FLIPPING OUT, storming around the place.

          JACK LIRA
          You just have to go down to LA and
          guess the right things on TV and
          they'll pay us... You have to use
          your fame now while you have it. We
          could have nice things.

          HARVEY MILK
          I don't have time to do game shows
          right now...
          This stops Jack cold.

          JACK LIRA
          You are horrible! I have worked on
          this surprise for you for weeks!

          HARVEY MILK
          Are you drunk right now?

          JACK LIRA
          You are an ungrateful asshole!

          HARVEY MILK
          Jack, I'll have more time soon.

          JACK LIRA
          You're ashamed of me!

          HARVEY MILK
          That's not true. I think you're
          smart. You're capable. No matter
          what your family or your father
          said. I believe in you... We
          should figure out something for you
          to do. I could get you a job.

          JACK LIRA
          I'll never be good enough for you!
          Jack THROWS A PIECE OF POTTERY AT HARVEY. It misses, CRASHING
          THROUGH THE WINDOW onto the street below.

          

          

          

          

          84.

          HARVEY MILK
          I'll get a broom.
          Harvey goes. Jack collapses into a chair.

          119 INT. AUDITORIUM IN ORANGE COUNTY - NIGHT

          TV CAMERAS ROLL. They've gotten their ORANGE COUNTY DEBATE!
          BRIGGS'S SUPPORTERS jeer Harvey as he rips into their State
          Senator. Their vehemence frightens Dick in the audience.
          Harvey lifts a Briggs flier.

          HARVEY MILK
          If in your statements here you say
          that child molestation is not an
          issue, why do you put out literature
          that hammers it home, why do you play
          on that myth and fear?

          JOHN BRIGGS
          Same thing with VD Harvey, we put
          out publications about VD so you
          can avoid it.

          HARVEY MILK
          (with a grin)
          But you've even admitted that
          there's more molestation in the
          heterosexual group! So why not get
          rid of the heterosexual teachers?
          Boos from the conservative audience.

          JOHN BRIGGS
          We are not talking about homos...
          child molestation, the fact is, at
          least 95 percent of the people are
          heterosexual. If we took
          heterosexuals out AND homosexuals
          out, you know what--

          JOHN BRIGGS (CONT'D) HARVEY MILK
          --we'd have no teachers We'd have no teachers--

          HARVEY MILK
          --No child molestation... So you're
          saying the percentage of population
          is equal to the percentage of child
          molestation?

          JOHN BRIGGS
          (getting more lost)
          No, no, I'm not saying that at all--

          

          

          

          

          85.

          HARVEY MILK
          That's what you just said.

          JOHN BRIGGS
          No. I'm saying that we cannot
          prevent child molestation so let's
          cut our odds down and take out the
          homosexual group and keep in the
          heterosexual group--
          Harvey laughs in disbelief at the asinine argument. Briggs
          looks down to his notes, lost. Harvey takes the opportunity
          to rip into the State Senator:

          HARVEY MILK
          (directly to Briggs)
          --Sir, in your own drive for
          personal power, how many careers
          are you willing to see destroyed?
          How many lives will you destroy in
          your lust for power, and when will
          you stop?
          The crowd boos, rails. This isn't San Francisco, it's Orange
          County. In the audience, Dick Pabich sweats, taken aback by
          the level of hatred. Harvey tries to maintain his composure.

          120 EXT. CASTRO STREET - NIGHT

          Harvey heads home from work. He starts into his store.
          He sees JACK LIRA'S SHADOW through the curtains upstairs, and
          turns instead to the cafe next door.

          121 INT. CASTRO CAFE - NIGHT

          Harvey sits down at the bar. The WAITER pours a coffee for
          him. Harvey looks up to the TV.
          HARVEY'S POV: DAN WHITE ON TV talking to a news reporter. It
          feels as if Dan is talking directly to Harvey.

          DAN WHITE
          All I'm really saying is, if we
          don't protect ourselves with this
          kind of legislation, a transvestite
          can show up at a public school with
          all the qualifications for teaching
          and they can't refuse to hire him.

          

          

          

          

          86.

          122 INT. CITY HALL / HARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

          Harvey rushes from a packed session in the Supervisors'
          Chambers to his office. Anne is behind him. He picks up the
          phone. It seems urgent.

          HARVEY MILK
          Hey Jack, what's wrong?

          123 INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - INTERCUT


          JACK LIRA
          Nothing. I just want to know when
          you'll be home.

          HARVEY MILK
          You just had them pull me out of my
          big vote on the dog shit ordinance.
          Did you do this on purpose, Jack?

          JACK LIRA
          It's poop, Harvey. Aren't I more
          important than poop?

          HARVEY MILK
          Yes, but... I don't know when I'll
          be home. Maybe 6. 6:15.

          JACK LIRA
          Fine. 6:15.
          Harvey hangs up. His patience is slipping. He looks up in
          time to see Dan heading down the hall with his briefcase.

          124 INT. CITY HALL / SUPERVISORS' CHAMBERS HALLWAY - DAY

          Harvey catches up to Dan who is on his way out.

          HARVEY MILK
          Dan? How's the baby?

          DAN WHITE
          You didn't bring up Supervisor pay
          raises. In fact, I heard you plan
          to publicly oppose them.

          HARVEY MILK
          I heard you planned to vote against
          them too, Dan. Were you trying to
          set me up?

          DAN WHITE (CONT'D)
          It's not a good time for me to
          bring it up. Politically.

          HARVEY MILK
          Dan, there's a vote to approve the
          police desegregation settlement,
          give me that and I'll consider
          backing pay raises.

          DAN WHITE
          (suddenly very dark)
          I don't trade votes... unlike you,
          the way I was raised, we believe in
          right and wrong. Moral and immoral.

          HARVEY MILK
          Black skin and White in your police
          department?
          (Dan steams)
          Dan, even Ronald Reagan's come out
          against Proposition Six. You're
          looking more and more out of touch.

          DAN WHITE
          If I come out against Prop Six,
          it's only for the invasion of
          State's rights issue.

          HARVEY MILK
          (smiles, trying to lighten)
          And the potential witch hunts
          against you "straight people,"
          right?
          Dan tries hard to come up with a cogent response. He can't.
          His behavior is alarming. He sets down his briefcase.

          DAN WHITE
          You underestimate me, Milk. You're
          very, very wrong about me.

          HARVEY MILK
          I don't know what you mean.
          A moment. Dan is on the verge of tears, hot angry tears.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          What is it, Dan? You can tell me.

          DAN WHITE
          You don't... You can't humiliate
          me. And you will not demean me.

          

          

          

          

          88.
          Anne appears down the hall. Dan has more on his mind, but the
          moment has passed. He picks up his briefcase and walks out of
          the building. Off Harvey, concerned.

          125 EXT. CITY HALL - LATER

          Harvey walks home. A PASSERBY shouts:

          PASSERBY
          You're the asshole that just passed
          that dog shit thing aren't you? What
          the hell do you have against dogs?

          HARVEY MILK
          (with his trademark charm)
          Sir, blind people can't see "shit."
          What the heck do you have against
          blind people?
          The young folks surrounding the PASSERBY laugh and hoot at
          Harvey's joke. Even the harassing PASSERBY can't help but
          crack a grin. Harvey beams.

          126 INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

          Opening the door, Harvey finds a trail of voter registration
          cards, anti-Briggs literature, and Coors beer cans. Pushing
          through his fear, he carefully follows the cans and flyers up
          the stairs and through his apartment.
          Odd notes are taped to the walls. They all lead to a black
          velvet curtain with a note attached: "YOU'VE ALWAYS LOVED THE

          CIRCUS, HARVEY, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY LAST ACT?"
          Harvey pulls back the curtain to find Jack's body, cold and
          discolored, hanging from a beam by a noose.
          HARVEY CAN'T MOVE. He is mesmerized... horrified.
          He grabs a knife and frantically tries cutting Jack down. He
          cuts through the rope and FALLS TO THE FLOOR with the HEAVY

          BODY.

          127 INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - LATER

          Scott arrives. Sitting very still, Harvey is being consoled
          by Cleve and Anne. Tears in his eyes, Harvey won't look up.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Harvey. Look at me. Look at me. You
          did everything you could.

          HARVEY
          No, I didn't. Not everything...

          HARVEY
          I could have come home at six
          o'clock, not six-fifteen.
          Scott puts his arm around Harvey. Harvey buries his head.
          Anne helps Cleve take down Jack's many hidden notes. Cleve
          quietly reads a prominently placed one:

          CLEVE JONES
          "Beware. The ides. Of November."

          Into the recorder as if re-living the event over again...

          HARVEY MILK
          Jack was gone. I didn't have time
          to mourn... There was no choice but
          to keep on... to keep fighting.

          128 INT. BARNUM AND BAILEY CIRCUS / MAKE UP ROOM / S.F. - DAY

          Harvey sits in a make-up chair. A MAKE-UP artist is painting
          him up to look like a clown. Several other CITY OFFICIALS are
          in chairs beyond him. Harvey turns to the make-up artist.
          With sincere enthusiasm:

          HARVEY MILK
          Thank you for this great honor. But
          do you think once the magazine is
          done snapping pictures, maybe I
          could keep the suit for a while?

          129 EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - DAY

          Still made up from head to toe as a clown, Harvey walks the
          streets of San Francisco. He waves, smiles, poses for photos
          with tourists. It's a rare moment of grace. He jumps on a
          trolley headed toward Castro. He instantly captures the
          imagination of a small GIRL wearing a knit hat.

          HARVEY MILK
          (re: their hats)
          Would you like to trade with me?

          GIRL
          No. What the heck are you?

          HARVEY MILK
          Oh, me? I'm an elected official. I
          run this city.

          

          

          

          

          90.
          He makes a show of it. She smiles. He hands her the flower
          he's been holding onto all afternoon.

          130 INT. "NO ON SIX" CENTER / MARKET STREET - NIGHT

          THIS IS THE MOMENT. Harvey watches aides on the phones comb
          districts for voting results. Jim fills up a map on the wall.

          DICK PABICH
          San Bernadino is coming in. Not
          good.

          HARVEY MILK
          Of course not. How not good?

          MICHAEL WONG
          60% for Briggs. Same in Fresno.

          HARVEY MILK
          Dear God, little Lotus Blossom.
          Harvey is stunned. Other districts follow with similar
          results. They go up in red on the map.

          JIM RIVALDO
          Imperial is 69% "for" so far.

          HARVEY MILK
          Put it up on the board.
          Harvey tries to stomach this major defeat, loss after loss.
          He starts reflexively tying his tie in a knot. Cleve comes up
          to Harvey, concerned.

          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
          The whole world is watching this.
          This is San Francisco we're about
          to lose. Are you ready?

          CLEVE JONES
          I can have 15,000 people in an
          hour. But there's gonna be riots if
          this thing passes.

          HARVEY MILK
          (darkens, pointed)
          There goddamn better be.

          CLEVE JONES
          (stops, a beat, then:)
          What are you telling me?

          

          

          

          

          91.

          HARVEY MILK
          I can't say it because I'm a public
          official, but for God's sake, if
          this thing passes, fight back.
          Cleve is stunned, holding the weight of Harvey's words.
          Harvey's focus is interrupted when Anne brings him the phone.

          ANNE KRONENBERG
          Don Amador down in LA.

          HARVEY
          (reluctantly answers)
          Kind of a bad time, Don.

          YOUNG TEEN (V.O.)
          No sir, this is Paul. Don just gave
          me the phone.

          HARVEY MILK
          Paul who?

          YOUNG TEEN (V.O.)
          You talked to me on the phone a
          year or so ago. I'm from
          Minnesota... I'm in a wheelchair.
          REVEAL: The boy in his wheelchair on the other end.

          HARVEY MILK
          (a beat to take it in, then:)
          I thought you were a goner, Paul.

          YOUNG TEEN
          I'm sorry. I should have called.
          When I read in the paper that you
          won the Supervisor seat, I got a
          friend to put me on a bus to LA.

          HARVEY MILK
          Who did you know in Los Angeles?

          YOUNG TEEN
          Nobody. That's the uh... I just
          didn't want to die anymore, sir.
          (Harvey's at a loss for words)
          I met your friend Don down here. I
          turned 18. I voted today against
          Prop Six... Thank you, Mr. Milk.

          HARVEY MILK
          No. You did this all by yourself.

          

          

          

          

          92.

          YOUNG TEEN
          I don't think I'd be alive right now
          without you, sir. You were right
          about LA. It's like gay Disney
          World.

          HARVEY MILK
          Then you have to see San Francisco!

          YOUNG TEEN
          Okay. I will. Don wanted me to
          um... congratulate you on what he
          says looks like a big win for us
          tonight. Congratulations Mr. Milk.
          Harvey turns back to the map. Jim Rivaldo is now coloring in
          LA county with green. On the other end of the phone, Harvey's
          friend in LA, Don Amador, is back on the line.

          DON AMADOR (V.O.)
          It looks like we've taken LA
          County, Harvey. By 65%. It's huge.

          HARVEY MILK
          I gotta go, Don. Thank you.
          (frantic, to the room)
          LA by 65% put it up! Put it up!
          The tone in the room is changing. Jim storms up.

          JIM RIVALDO
          The polls were off. Briggs is going
          down by more than 2 to 1. The only
          district where it's leading in San
          Francisco is Dan White's.
          Harvey takes a moment to absorb the map. Anne, Dick & Jim,
          all the volunteers. What this apparent win means to him, to
          his people. To Cleve:

          HARVEY MILK
          Well crap Cleve, now what are we
          going to do tonight?!
          (re: a giant, jock strap
          wearing, Lady Liberty)
          Cover up Lady Liberty. The cameras
          will be coming our way.

          131 INT. "NO ON SIX" CENTER / MARKET STREET - LATER

          TV cameras roll. Lady liberty is covered with a "No on Six"
          poster. A brass band marches dramatically into the hall.
          Balloons fall. Harvey MOUNTS the stage to INCREDIBLE CHEERS.

          

          

          

          

          93.

          HARVEY MILK
          To the gay community all over this
          state... my message to you is... so
          far a lot of people joined us and
          rejected Proposition Six, and now we
          owe them something... We must destroy
          the myths once and for all, shatter
          them. We must continue to speak
          out... and most importantly, most
          importantly, every gay person must
          come out.

          (CHEERS)
          Tonight... Tonight it is clear that
          everyone out there does know one of
          us. And now that they do, they see
          we are not sick... they can feel we
          are not wrong... and they know we
          should have a place in this great
          country and in this world... A
          message of hope has been to sent to
          all the young people out there...
          to all those afraid of this wave of
          hate... to all those who have lost
          their homes and their hometowns...
          tonight we know there is a place
          for us! My brothers and sisters...
          we can come home again!
          The crowd goes WILD. Harvey BEAMS. Moscone walks up onto
          stage and lifts Harvey's hand. Harvey is now a member of the
          S.F. political elite. Cleve watches from afar as Harvey steps
          off and disappears into the crowd.

          132 INT. DAN WHITE'S HOME - NIGHT

          Dan watches HARVEY'S VICTORY SPEECH on the local news.

          133 EXT. THE CASTRO - MOMENTS LATER

          The party behind him, Harvey scans the block. Cleve catches
          up, looking at Harvey, probing:

          CLEVE JONES
          What's the matter?

          HARVEY MILK
          You ever heard of sore losers? Well,
          I'm a sore winner... I thought we
          were goners.

          (HALF-JOKING)
          I'd started looking forward to the
          riots.

          

          

          

          

          94.

          CLEVE JONES
          I told you, I don't "do" losing.

          HARVEY MILK
          I think maybe we're best with our
          backs to the wall. It's too quiet.
          (a new idea, what's next)
          I think we should march on
          Washington D.C. next year.

          CLEVE JONES
          Milk, you're a decent politician, a
          mediocre businessman, but you're a
          lousy gay man.
          (Harvey knows what he's
          getting at)
          Take some time off. Fifty's right
          around the corner.
          (a devilish grin)
          Nobody will want you after that...
          I can handle D.C.

          HARVEY MILK
          (smiles, incredulous)
          The people voted for us, Cleve Jones.

          CLEVE JONES
          They did. There's nowhere to march
          tonight, Mr. Harvey Milk. Lets go
          back inside.
          Turning back, they savor the moment, like father and son
          walking to Castro Camera, growing ever smaller in the frame.

          134 INT. CITY HALL / SUPERVISORS' OFFICES - DAY

          Dan White slides a sealed letter across a desk to an Aide.
          It's addressed to Moscone. He seems oddly calm.

          DAN WHITE
          Could you give this to the Mayor
          for me? As soon as possible.

          135 INT. CITY HALL / SUPERVISORS' OFFICES - DAY

          Harvey walks down the hallway to his office, a spring in his
          step. There are nods, hellos if not outright deference from
          most passersby. His newfound political muscle is evident.
          He comes face to face with Dan White.

          HARVEY MILK
          Morning, Dan.

          

          

          

          

          95.

          DAN WHITE
          I just resigned. Congratulations.
          I'm sure you're pleased.
          Harvey doesn't know what to say. Dan's right, it does make
          him happy. But it's not that simple.

          DAN WHITE (CONT'D)
          You'll be the next President of the
          Board.

          HARVEY MILK
          I'm sure we could work together--
          Dan walks away from Harvey. He doesn't want to hear anything
          Harvey has to say.
          Harvey watches as Dan is met in the hallway by an OFFICER
          from the POLICE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION.

          OFFICER
          Hey, Dan. Just got word. Can we
          talk to you for a minute?

          DAN WHITE
          Sure...
          Dan heads for his office.

          OFFICER
          Downstairs. The Association
          meeting room...
          Harvey watches as Dan follows the officer down the stairs to
          an ASSOCIATION MEETING ROOM on the next floor. When the DOOR
          OPENS, Harvey sees SEVERAL REPRESENTATIVES from the Police
          Department wearing somber expressions.
          It looks as if Dan is about to get REAMED OUT.

          136 INT. TV NEWS REPORT - DAY

          ACTUAL FOOTAGE: Channel 5 reporting from Dan White's street:

          DAVID FOWLER (ON TV)
          Most people were surprised when Dan
          White quit last Friday citing
          financial difficulties. Now we've
          heard that White is asking for his
          Supervisor job back. But many say--

          137 INT. CITY HALL / HARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

          Harvey, watching on the small TV set in his office.

          

          

          

          

          96.

          DAVID FOWLER (ON TV)
          --White gave up all of his
          political chits when he resigned
          without making any arrangements.
          The news story transitions in the B.G. as Harvey gets up.

          NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV/BG)
          The city of San Francisco is in
          disbelief. Four-hundred bodies have
          been found thus far in Jonestown,
          Guyana. Leader of the People's
          Temple, Jim Jones...

          138 INT. CITY HALL / DAN WHITE'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

          Harvey heads to Dan's office. He toys with the nameplate.
          Something bittersweet lingers. He walks in.
          HARVEY'S POV: On City Hall's lawn, Dan is with the press. He
          looks up, seeing Harvey in his office window.
          They make eye contact. It bears all the awkwardness of a
          relationship lost.

          139 EXT. CITY HALL - MOMENTS LATER

          Something's snapped. With adolescent frustration in evidence,
          Dan is with his wife, the press and a few supporters.

          DAN WHITE
          It was a major decision on Friday
          that I had to come... to arrive at.
          But since that time, people unknown
          to me, plus my family and friends,
          have come to me and stated that
          they want me to stay in office,
          that they support me... So I'm
          asking the Mayor to let me stay in
          office to serve the people...

          140 INT. CITY HALL / MAYOR MOSCONE'S OFFICE - DAY

           Harvey is firm, his hands planted on the Mayor's desk.

           HARVEY MILK
          He gets dragged into a closed door
          meeting with the Police Officers
          Association, and comes out
          demanding his job back? What do you
          think they promised him? Or worse,
          how did they threaten him?

          

          

          

          

          97.

          MAYOR MOSCONE
          A man has the right to change his
          mind. Give me some peace.

          HARVEY MILK
          How many of our propositions has
          Dan shut down? We could finally
          settle this police desegregation
          nonsense. Cement rent control. It's
          his vote on this Board that stands
          in our way.

          MAYOR MOSCONE
          I get it, Harvey. I've been lobbied
          all week. Enough.

          HARVEY MILK
          Let me just remind you that you're
          up for re-election. If you re-
          appoint Dan, you lose the gay vote.
          They listen to me. You won't get
          elected dog catcher.

          MAYOR MOSCONE
          (stern, silent, a beat, then:)
          I'll make my decision on Monday.
          (as Harvey's on his way out,
          with a wry grin)
          You know what you sounded like just
          now? Boss Tweed or Mayor Daly.

          HARVEY MILK
          (returns the smile)
          A "homosexual" with a bit of
          power... rather scary isn't it, Mr.
          Mayor?
          OFF Harvey. He's come a long way.

          OPERA MUSIC CROSSES THE CUT TO:

          141 INT. SAN FRANCISCO OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT

          Harvey sits in a balcony seat of the filled, darkened opera
          house next to Brazilian opera star BIDU SAYAO, 76. He's
          enraptured by a production of TOSCA.
          ON STAGE IT'S "O Scarpia, we shall meet before God!" Refusing
          to be taken prisoner, Tosca jumps from the walls of the
          castle set to her death.

          142 INT. DAN WHITE'S HOME / LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Mary Ann offers the phone to Dan. Dan takes it.

          

          

          

          

          98.

          DAN WHITE
          (into the phone)
          Yes. This is Dan White.

          KCBS REPORTER (V.O.)
          I'm Barbra Taylor from KCBS. I'm
          interested in your reaction. I've
          received information from the
          Mayor's office that you won't be
          getting your job back.

          DAN WHITE
          I'm sorry. I don't know anything
          about that.
          Dan hangs up on her.

          143 INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT

          Harvey can't sleep. He dials the phone. He lets it ring and
          ring. Finally, a voice picks up on the other line.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Hello?
          REVEAL: Scott, half asleep.

          HARVEY MILK
          Sorry to wake you up.

          SCOTT SMITH
          What's wrong?

          HARVEY MILK
          I went to the opera tonight. Guess
          who my date was.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Who?

          HARVEY MILK
          Bidu Sayao herself. She was in the
          first Puccini I ever saw. The crowd
          went wild. It was like I was young
          again, seeing my first live opera...

          SCOTT SMITH
          If you go to the opera again, you
          should call me.

          HARVEY MILK
          Really?
          Scott gets out of bed, considers his words. It's intimate.

          

          

          

          

          99.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Yes. I'd go with you.

          HARVEY MILK
          I'd like that.
          Harvey is quiet, a rare moment of reflection. An unexpected
          tear rolls down his cheek.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Harvey?

          HARVEY MILK
          Look out the window, the sun's
          coming up.

          SCOTT SMITH
          It's late. You should get some
          sleep.

          HARVEY MILK
          I don't want to miss it.

          SCOTT SMITH
          Miss what?

          HARVEY MILK
          This.
          Harvey's single word answer means, "Life."
          OFF Harvey: Neither wants to hang up the phone.

          144 INT. DAN WHITE'S HOME / LIVING ROOM - MORNING

          The sun rising in his own living room, Dan White has been up
          all night, too. The coffee table is covered with coke cans
          and junk food wrappers.

          145 INT. CITY HALL - DAY

          Waiting for a MAN inside to turn away, Dan sneaks in through
          a side window at City Hall. The man calls after him:

          MAN
          Hey, wait a minute, Mr.--

          DAN WHITE
          My aide was supposed to come down
          here and let me in the side door,
          but she never showed up.

          MAN
          And you are?

          

          

          

          

          100.

          DAN WHITE
          I'm Dan White. City Supervisor.
          We follow Dan down the hall and into the grand entry-way.

          146 INT. CITY HALL / METAL DETECTORS - SAME

          Harvey walks through City Hall's METAL DETECTORS. He picks up
          his keys from the dish and heads up the grand staircase. Like
          ships in the night, Harvey just misses Dan exiting the
          elevator. Dan heads into Mayor Moscone's office.

          147 INT. CITY HALL / SUPERVISORS' CHAMBERS - MOMENTS LATER

          With Dianne, Harvey is thrilled, rubbing it in.

          HARVEY MILK
          Who's it gonna be? Is he replacing
          Dan with that God Damned liberal
          lefty Don Horanzy? That'll really
          shake up the Board, huh?

          DIANNE FEINSTEIN
          All I know is that we're getting a
          new Supervisor today. If Dan shows
          up, just avoid him. We don't need
          a scene today, right Harvey?

          HARVEY MILK
          (grins ear to ear)
          Heaven forbid, Dianne.

          148 INT. CITY HALL / MAYOR MOSCONE'S WAITING ROOM - SAME

          The MAYOR'S SECRETARY sits at her desk. Shouting can be heard
          from inside his office.

          149 INT. CITY HALL / MAYOR MOSCONE'S OFFICE - SAME

          Moscone leads Dan White to the bar beside his office. Dan is
          enraged. Moscone lights a cigarette.

          DAN WHITE
          You can't take this away from me!
          Moscone has his back turned, pouring them cocktails.

          MAYOR MOSCONE
          The issue is what's fair, for the
          people of your district. Take some
          time off. Spend it with your
          family.

          

          

          

          

          101.
          Moscone finishes pouring two cocktails, and turns to see Dan
          White brandishing his revolver.

          150 INT. CITY HALL / MAYOR MOSCONE'S WAITING ROOM - SAME

          Moscone's Secretary, and a WAITING MAN note the THREE DULL
          THUDS, not so different than a backfire. The secretary looks
          out the window, concerned. The waiting man checks his watch.

          151 INT. CITY HALL / MAYOR MOSCONE'S OFFICE - SAME

          Still gripped in his hand, Moscone's cigarette burns a hole
          in his tie.

          152 INT. CITY HALL / SUPERVISORS' OFFICES - MOMENTS LATER

          Dan walks past Dick Pabich, past Dianne's office. Harvey's
          voice can be heard down the hall. He sounds up-beat,

          OPTIMISTIC:

          HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
          This time next year we're marching
          on Washington D.C. It'll look like
          Market and Castro, but with a
          million people. Write that down.
          Tell President Carter we're coming
          after him next. I'm going to
          deposit this. I'll be back in 20
          minutes.
          Dan arrives at Harvey's office door. Harvey is with a FRIEND,
          preparing to leave, surprised to see Dan in his doorway.

          DAN WHITE
          Say, Harve, can I see you for a
          minute?

          HARVEY MILK
          Sure.
          Dan walks Harvey down the hall to his old office.

          153 INT. CITY HALL / DAN WHITE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

          Harvey walks in first. Dan stays between Harvey and the door.
          Dan closes it. Harvey smiles, sensing something is off.
          Dan draws his revolver. Harvey raises his hand. Dan Fires.
          The bullet rips through Harvey's hand and down his arm.

          HARVEY MILK
          Oh no... N--
          Dan Fires again, silencing Harvey's cry for help.

          

          

          

          

          102.
          Harvey turns away. Another bullet rips into his chest, and he
          falls to his knees, now facing the window. He staggers toward
          it. The moment is extended as we see Harvey's POV of the
          Opera House outside the window, and the Castro beyond it.
          HOLD ON HARVEY, gazing out at his beloved city.
          Dan puts his revolver to the back of Harvey's head. HE FIRES.
          And just like that, Harvey falls.

          HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Last week I got a phone call--

          156 INT. FLASH BACK - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL

           Harvey is still speaking into the tape recorder...

           HARVEY
          --from Altoona, Pennsylvania, and
          the voice was quite young, and the
          person said... "Thanks." You've got
          to elect gay people so that that
          young child and the thousands upon
          thousand like him know there's
          hope... hope for a better world...

          157 INT. MEMORIAL SERVICE / SAN FRANCISCO - EARLY EVENING

          Scott and Anne enter a sparsely attended memorial service.
          Most of the seats are empty. The speaker is unfamiliar, some
          appointed CITY OFFICIAL.

          SCOTT SMITH
          (finally crumbling, tears roll)
          Where is everybody? Didn't anyone
          give a damn?

          158 INT. FLASH BACK - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL

          Harvey speaking into the tape recorder.

          HARVEY MILK
          I ask this... If there should be an
          assassination, I would hope that
          five, ten, one hundred, a thousand
          would rise. I would like to see
          every gay lawyer, every gay
          architect come out--

          159 EXT. MEMORIAL SERVICE 1978 - CONTINUOUS

          Walking back out onto the street, Anne and Scott turn to look
          down Market Street, the camera pans and drifts to reveal:

          

          

          

          

          103.

          A MASSIVE CANDLELIGHT MARCH. CLEVE JONES LEADS TENS OF
          THOUSANDS of San Franciscans of every religion, nationality,
          sexuality, all of the familiar faces and many new ones...
          THEY ALL MARCH SILENTLY up Market Street to the palace Harvey
          dreamed could be his own: City Hall.

          HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
          --If a bullet should enter my
          brain, let that bullet destroy
          every closet door... And that's
          all. I ask for the movement to
          continue. Because it's not about
          personal gain, not about ego, not
          about power... it's about the
          "us's" out there. Not only gays,
          but the Blacks, the Asians, the
          disabled, the seniors, the us's.
          Without hope, the us's give up--
          As the thousands of mourners arrive at City Hall, they place
          their candles around the statue of Lincoln.

          HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          --I know you cannot live on hope
          alone, but without it, life is not
          worth living. So you, and you, and
          you...

          159B INT. FLASHBACK - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT


           HARVEY MILK
          You gotta give em' hope... you
          gotta give em' hope.
          Harvey closes his note pad, puts down his pencil, and pushes
          stop on his recorder.

          160 EXT. CASTRO CAMERA - NIGHT

          Push in on Castro Camera. The sign still in the window,
