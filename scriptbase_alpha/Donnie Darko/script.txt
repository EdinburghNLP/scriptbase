Donnie Darko (2001) movie scriptby Richard Kelly. Shooting script.
More info about this movie on IMDb.com


                  FADE IN:

We descend upon Carpathian Ridge, a crescent-shaped cliff that
extrudes from the dense Virginia evergreens above a deep rock canyon.
The cliff marks the end of a dirt road that winds down from above.

Donnie Darko (sixteen) is asleep at the edge of the cliff. With his
bike collapsed next to him, he is shivering, curled up on the foetal
position.

He slowly opens his eyes and looks around, disoriented by the
morning light. He then stands up, looking down into the expansive
rock canyon. After a moment of hesitation, he takes his bike back
up the hill.


EXT. MIDDLESEX - MORNING (11 A.M.)

Montage is choreographed to 'Never Tear Us Apart' by INXS.

Donnie pedals down into the suburban village of Middlesex, Virginia
...passing by a large rock 'Middlesex' rock-pattern.

Donnie pedals past two neighbourhood women who are speedwalking
with handweights. They smile at him.

A Pontiac Trans-Am speeds by.


EXT. NEIGHBOURHOOD STREET - DAY (SATURDAY 1 P.M.)

Donnie turns the corner and heads towards the garage.

We pan over to the Darko house... moving through the front yard
where Eddie Darko (forty-four) pulls the cord and his gas-powered
leaf-blower roars to life.

Elizabeth Darko (nineteen) comes out the front door. She approaches
her dad from behind. Eddie turns and aims the leaf-blower at her
face... blasting her with air.


EXT. DARKO DRIVEWAY - NEXT

Donnie parks his bike and goes inside.


EXT. DARKO BACKYARD / PATIO - NEXT

We pull back from Samantha Darko (ten) as she is jumping on a
trampoline and pan over to Rose Darko (forty-two) as she sits at
a table reading a paperback copy of Stephen King's "IT". She
glances over to the kitchen.


INT. KITCHEN - NEXT

Donnie walks into the kitchen. He then goes to the refrigerator.
Printed in magic marker on the refrigerator notepad is the phrase:
WHERE IS DONNIE?


INT. FAMILY ROOM - EVENING (5 P.M.)

The opening theme of "Who's the Boss?" begins as we see Tony
Danza's blue van and the title card. We reveal Samantha, sitting on
the floor, singing softly to the theme song "Brand New Life"
performed by Larry Weiss.

We pan over to Donnie, sitting in the La-Z Boy.


INT. KITCHEN - EVENING (6 P.M.)

The Darko family has convened for dinner. They eat silently for
several moments.

               ELIZABETH
     I'm voting for Dukakis.

               EDDIE
     Perhaps when you have children of your
     own that need braces, and you can't afford
     them because half of your husband's paycheck
     goes to the federal government, you'll
     regret that decision.

               ELIZABETH
          (amused bitterness)
     I'm not gonna squeeze one out until I'm
     thirty.

               DONNIE
     Will you still be working at Yarn Barn?
     'Cause that's a great place to raise children.

               ROSE
     No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be
     going to Harvard this fall.

               ELIZABETH
     I haven't been accepted yet, mother.

               ROSE
          (smiles)
     If you think Michael Dukakis will provide
     for this country prior to the point when
     you decide to squeeze one out, then I think
     you're misinformed.

               SAMANTHA
     When can I squeeze one out?

               DONNIE
          (to his sister)
     Not until like... eighth grade.

               ROSE
          (to Donnie)
     Excuse me?

               ELIZABETH
     Donnie? You're a dick.

               DONNIE
     Whoa, Elizabeth. A little hostile, there.
     Maybe you should be the one in therapy.
     Then Mom and Dad can pay someone two
     hundred dollars an hour to listen to all
     of your thoughts... so we won't have to.

               ELIZABETH
     Maybe you'd like to tell Mom and Dad why
     you stopped taking your medication.

An awkward silence.

               ROSE
          (surprised)
     You've stopped taking your medication?

               SAMANTHA
     When can I squeeze one out, Mom?

               DONNIE
          (glaring at Elizabeth)
     You're such a fuck-ass.

               ROSE
     When did you stop taking your medication?

               ELIZABETH
          (laughing)
     Did you just call me a fuck-ass?

               ROSE
     That's enough.

               ELIZABETH
          (to Donnie)
     You can suck a fuck.

               DONNIE
     Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly
     does one suck a fuck?

               ROSE
          (disgusted)
     We will not have this kind of language at
     the dinner table.

They are all silent for a moment.

               SAMANTHA
     What's a fuck-ass?

Despite his brave efforts to hold back laughter, Eddie Darko lets
out a slight guffaw.


INT. ELIZABETH'S ROOM - EVENING (SATURDAY NIGHT, 9 P.M.)

Elizabeth talks on the phone, getting ready for her Saturday
night. Rose knocks and then enters.

               ELIZABETH
          (into the phone)
     No. I took a year off to be with you.
          (beat)
     Of course I care. Don't get angry.
          (covering the phone)
     What?

               ROSE
     How did you know -

               ELIZABETH
          (cutting her off)
     I didn't realise it was such a big
     deal.

               ROSE
     It is a big deal.

               ELIZABETH
     I caught him flushing pills down the
     toilet. He knows you check the container.


INT. DONNIE'S ROOM - NEXT

Donnie lies on his bed, reading "Collected Short Stories" by
Graham Greene. His room is an organised wreck.

Rose enters and begins to pick things up of the floor.

               DONNIE
     Get out of my room.

Rose bitterly turns to leave, but stops at the door.

               ROSE
     I wish I knew where you went at night.
          (beat)
     Did you toilet paper the Johnson's
     house?

               DONNIE
          (still reading)
     I stopped rolling houses in the sixth
     grade, Mom.
          (beat)
     Get out of my room.

               ROSE
     You know... it would be nice to look at
     you some time... and see my son. I don't
     recognise this person today.

               DONNIE
     Then why don't you start taking the
     goddamn pills?

Donnie leans over and turns off his lamp. Rose turns and leaves
her son alone in the dark, closing the door behind her.

               DONNIE (cont'd)
     Bitch.


INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NEXT

Rose stops in her tracks, hearing this. She then walks into her
bedroom and closes the door.


INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NEXT

Rose goes into bed with Eddie, who is reading a hardback copy of
Stephen King's "The Tommyknockers".

               ROSE
     Our son just called me a bitch.

               EDDIE
          (beat)
     You're not a bitch.


INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - NEXT

Donnie removes his pills from the medicine cabinet. We see
insert that reads: L. THURMAN M.D.

He looks at the bottle for a moment, and then takes three pills
and swallows them... staring at his reflection in the mirror.


INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT (12 A.M.)

Eddie sits up in bed, unable to sleep.


INT. FAMILY ROOM - NEXT

The TV pops on. Eddie drops into the La-Z Boy.

They are replaying a Bush/Dukakis debate. Eddie laughs.


INT. FOYER - NEXT

We pull back and pan over to a grandfather clock... as the hand
reaches midnight.

Title card:

               OCTOBER 2 1988


INT. DONNIE'S ROOM - NIGHT (EARLY SUNDAY MORNING, 1 A.M.)

               VOICE
          (whisper)
     Wake... up... Donnie.

Donnie jerks upright in his bed, awakened from a bad dream. He
looks over at his alarm clock: 12:50 a.m. His expression is
distant... confused.


INT. FOYER - NEXT

Donnie walks downstairs.


INT. FAMILY ROOM - NEXT

Donnie stares at Eddie, asleep in the La-Z Boy.


INT. KITCHEN - NEXT

Donnie walks into the kitchen, removes the magic marker from the
refrigerator message board.


INT. FOYER - NEXT

Donnie walks to the front and exits the house.


EXT. DARKO HOUSE, FRONT YARD - NEXT

Donnie walks down the front walk to the street.


EXT. NEIGHBOURHOOD STREET - NEXT

Donnie walks down the street.


EXT. SEVENTH HOLE - NIGHT (1:30 A.M.)

Donnie arrives next to the pin and stares off into the distance.

               VOICE
     Helluva night for a walk... huh, Donnie?

Donnie stares off into the distance.

               VOICE (cont'd)
     Tonight is very special, Donnie.

               DONNIE
     What?

               VOICE
     I've been watching you.
          (beat)
     Do you believe in God, Donnie?

Donnie doesn't answer. He holds his stomach, taking deep breaths.

               VOICE (cont'd)
     God loves his children, Donnie. God loves
     you.

There... standing on the seventh hole is a six-foot-tall figure
dressed in a grotesque bunny suit.

Donnie stares at the Bunny nervously as a wave of nausea overcomes
him.

       BUNNY
     My name is Frank.
          (beat)
     I want you to follow me.

       DONNIE
     Why?

       FRANK
     I'm here to save you.
          (beat)
     The world is coming to an end, Donnie.

Donnie doesn't answer.

       FRANK (cont'd)
     Look up in the sky, Donnie.

He looks up into the black night.

       FRANK (cont'd)
     28 days... 6 hours... 42 minutes... 12
     seconds. That is when the world will end.

Donnie looks back at Frank. His expression is a vacant expanse
of confusion.


INT. FOYER - NIGHT

Elizabeth comes through the front door, leans back against it,
closes her eyes.


INT. FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

Eddie Darko sleeps reclined in the La-Z Boy. The final notes of
the Channel 12 National Anthem fade away to static.

From above... a thunderous crash. Plaster rains from the ceiling
...Books fly off the bookshelf as the entire wall-mount collapses
to the floor.

Eddie jerks awake.


INT. FOYER - NEXT

Elizabeth falls back in horror as plaster rains down from around
the chandelier... debris falling in the dining-room doorway.


EXT. SEVENTH HOLE - MORNING (SUNDAY MORNING, 10 A.M.)

Donnie is curled up, asleep on the green. A golf ball lands on
the green and rolls within inches of his head.

A golf cart filled with four older men arrives. Dr. Fisher
(forty-five) gets out first.

               DR. FISHER
     Donnie Darko?
          (beat)
     Son? What's going on here?

Jim Cunningham (forty), the man riding shotgun, gets out of the
cart and walks over.

       JIM CUNNINGHAM
     Who is it, Don?

       DR. FISHER
     Eddie Darko's kid.

Donnie gets up and brushes himself off. On his arm he sees
something written in black magic marker.

Numbers.... 28:06:42:12.

Donnie stares at the numbers on his arm, confused.

               DR. FISHER (cont'd)
          (to Jim, kissing his ass)
     Sorry about this, Jim, just a... a kid
     from the neighbourhood.
          (back to Donnie)
     So let's stay off the greens at night, OK?

Jim Cunningham stares at Donnie with a friendly grin.

               DONNIE
     Sorry, Dr. Fisher. It won't happen again.


EXT. NEIGHBOURHOOD STREET / DARKO HOUSE - MORNING (11 A.M.)

Donnie walks down the street towards his house.

A fire engine. Two police cars. A news van... All parked in front
of his house.

There are dozens of neighbours in the street surrounding a
barricade. Donnie moves through the crowd where a Police Officer
is standing.

               DONNIE
     Hey, I live here!

               POLICE OFFICER
     Are you... Donnie Darko?

               DONNIE
     Yeah!

The Officer lets him through.

Near the cul-de-sac there is a large caterpillar crane lifting
something from inside the house. There are firemen roaming
around. Two Police Officers are speaking with Eddie and Rose.
Donnie looks over at the house.

A crane lifts a gigantic jet engine over from the house towards
a large flatbed truck. Firemen kick pieces of wood and shingle
from the roof.

He turns and sees his entire family standing there. Eddie is
holding Samantha.

               SAMANTHA
     It fell on your room.


EXT. CUL-DE-SAC - LATER ON

Two men in suits approach from a black sedan. A police officer
directs them to Rose. One of the men removes a badge from his
pocket and holds it up for Rose to see.

               MAN
     Mrs. Darko, my name is Bob Garland and
     this is David Coleman. We're with the FAA.
     If you don't mind, we'd like to speak
     with you and your husband privately.

Elizabeth looks over at Donnie with a grin.

               ELIZABETH
          (whispering)
     They don't know where it came from.

Donnie looks over in awe as the mammoth engine is now strapped
to the flatbed truck. A man in a silver firesuit sprays the
engine down with water.


EXT. CUL-DE-SAC - MOMENTS LATER

Eddie is signing some documents in front of Garland at a table
that has been set up. Another FAA guy is there.

               FAA MAN
          (pointing to the document)
     And then here as well.

Eddie signs off, and Garland takes the documents.

               GARLAND
     We've arranged for you to stay at a
     hotel, get some sleep. We'll take care
     of things here.

Eddie picks Samantha up into his arms. He stands with Rose and
Elizabeth... turning towards Donnie... who seems lost in a trance.

               EDDIE
     Come on, Donnie... we're going to a hotel.


INT. HOLIDAY INN, ROOM 614 - SUNDOWN (SUNDAY NIGHT, 5:30 P.M.)

Donnie lies in bed, watching television. Elizabeth is spread out
on the other bed. Samantha sits on the edge of Elizabeth's bed,
holding a stuffed unicorn named Ariel.

               SAMANTHA
     If it fell from a plane, then what
     happened to the plane?

               ELIZABETH
     They don't know, Samantha.

               SAMANTHA
     Is there any way that we can make money
     from this? Couldn't we get on television
     if we sue the airline?


INT. HOLIDAY INN, ROOM 615 - NEXT

Rose and Eddie lie awake in the dark.

               ROSE
     So let me get this straight. No airline
     will claim ownership of the engine. So we
     have to wait for the FAA to decide who
     fixes my roof.
          (beat)
     Fuck that. We're taking the money out of
     savings.

               EDDIE
          (quoting Rod Serling)
     You are entering a new dimension of sight
     and sound...

Rose begins to laugh.


INT. HOLIDAY INN, ROOM 614 - NEXT

               SAMANTHA
     Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He
     stinks.

               DONNIE
     When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna
     fart in your face.

               SAMANTHA
          (walking to the door)
     I'm telling Mom.

               ELIZABETH
     Samantha, don't go over there.


INT. HOLIDAY INN, ROOM 615 - LATER THAT NIGHT

                EDDIE
     Frankie Feedler.

                ROSE
     What?

                EDDIE
     Frankie Feedler. You remember him from
     high school?

                ROSE
       (long beat)
     He was a year ahead of us?

                EDDIE
     He died, remember? On the way to the prom.
       (beat)
     He was doomed.

Rose lies there silently.

                EDDIE (cont'd)
     Jesus Christ. They could have said the
     same thing about Donnie. Our Donnie.
       (beat)
     But he dodged it. He dodged his bullet,
     Rose.

Rose rolls over to embrace him.

               EDDIE (cont'd)
     That's my boy.

Moments later, the door to the adjoining room opens. It is
Samantha.

               SAMANTHA
     Mom, Donnie said he's gonna fart in
     my face.

EXT. BUS STOP - MORNING (MONDAY MORNING, 7 A.M.)

Rose drops Donnie and Samantha off at the corner.

               ROSE
     Ms. Farmer will pick you up from recital.
     Bye, now.

She pulls of in the Taurus.

Already waiting at the bus stop is Joanie James (eleven). Also
Cherita Chen (fifteen).

               SAMANTHA
     Hi, Cherita.

               CHERITA
     Chut up.

Also there are Donnie's two best friends, Sean Smith (sixteen)
and Ronald Fisher (fifteen)

               RONALD
          (raising his hands in victory)
     DARKO CHEATS DEATH! Man... you're famous!
     I called you, like, a jillion times last
     night!

               DONNIE
     We went to a hotel.

               RONALD
     My dad said he found you on the golf
     course. Are you sleepwalking again?

               DONNIE
     I don't wanna talk about it.

               SEAN
     Now that you're famous, you gotta have
     a smoke.

Sean hands Donnie a Marlboro Red and he takes it, looking over
at Samantha and Joanie.

               DONNIE
     What happens if you tell Mom and Dad
     about this, Samantha?

               SAMANTHA
     You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.

               JOANIE
     So... grody.

Sean, Ronald and Donnie light up. Ronald is the most amateur-
looking.

               SEAN
     Hey, Cherita... want a cigarette?

               CHERITA
     Chut up.

               RONALD
          (mimicking)
     Chut up!

               SEAN
     Go back to China, bitch!

               DONNIE
     Leave her alone, man.

Cherita looks over at Donnie... her quiet devastation poorly
hidden.


EXT. / INT. MIDDLESEX RIDGE SCHOOL - MORNING (8 A.M.)

The following montage is three long Steadicam shots in the main
school hallway and courtyard.

We follow Donnie and his friends as they pour out of the back of
the emergency exit of the school bus to 'Head Over Heels' by
Tears for Fears.

We pick up teachers Karen Pomeroy (twenty-seven) and Dr. Kenneth
Monnitoff (thirty) and Kitty Farmer (forty-two), with Jim
Cunningham, as they make their way through the hallways.

Swarms of girls surround Donnie as he makes his way to his
locker. There is a huge smile on his face.

We reveal Gretchen Ross (fifteen)... we see Principal Cole
(thirty-eight) and then Samantha's dance team (Sparkle Motion)
practising their routine in the courtyard.

We follow Ms. Pomeroy into English class... then time-lapse
dissolve through the doorway...


INT. ENGLISH CLASS - DAY (8:30 A.M.)

Ms. Pomeroy has been reading from "The Destructors" by Graham
Greene.

               MS. POMEROY
     "There would be headlines in the papers.
     Even the grown-up gangs who ran the
     betting at the all-in wrestling and the
     barrow-boys would hear with respect how
     Old Misery's house had been destroyed. It
     was as though this plan had been with him
     all his life, pondered through the
     seasons, now in his fifteenth year
     crystallised with the pain of puberty."

Donnie sits in the front.

               MS. POMEROY (cont'd)
     What is Graham Greene trying to
     communicate in this passage? Why do the
     children break into Old Misery's house?

Joanie James raises her hand.

               MS. POMEROY (cont'd)
     Joanie.

               JOANIE
     They wanted to rob him.

               MS. POMEROY
     Joanie, if you had actually read the short
     story... which, at a whopping thirteen
     pages must have kept you up all night, you
     would know that the children find a great
     deal of money hidden in a mattress. But
     they burn it.

The class gives an "Awwww." Joanie blushes.

               MS. POMEROY (cont'd)
     Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your recent
     brush with mass destruction, you can give
     us your opinion?

               DONNIE
     Well... they say it right when they are
     ripping the place to shreds. When they
     flood the house. That like... destruction
     is a form of creation. So the fact that
     they burn the money is... ironic. They
     just want to see what happens when they
     tear the world apart.
       (beat)
     They want to change things.

Gretchen Ross stands at the doorway to the classroom.

               MS. POMEROY
     May we help you?

               GRETCHEN
     I just registered, and I think they put me
     in the wrong English class.

Ms. Pomeroy studies her.

               MS. POMEROY
     You look like you belong here.

               GRETCHEN
     Umm, where do I sit?

Ms. Pomeroy thinks for a moment. There are several empty chairs.

               MS. POMEROY
     Sit next to the boy you think is the
     cutest. Girls, get up.

The whole class begins to freak out. The girls all get out of
their seats... eating this up. Ronald fixes his hair.

               MS. POMEROY
     Quiet! Let her choose.

Without hesitation, Gretchen scans the class for every guy. As
she gracefully takes her seat next to Donnie, they make eye
contact. Donnie grins ear to ear.

The class freaks out laughing.


INT. TAURUS - SUNSET (MONDAY NIGHT, 6 P.M.)

Eddie drives Donnie down Old Gun Road, a windy back-road that
goes towards the country.

               EDDIE
     So how was school today?

               DONNIE
     It was great. We had peanut-butter
     sandwiches and apples and honey at
     snacktime. And then during show-and-tell,
     my stuffed walrus was a big hit.

               EDDIE
     Good Lord.
          (beat)
     So the construction guys say it'll take
     about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline
     better not fuck us on the shingle match.

               DONNIE
     Do they know yet?

               EDDIE
     Know what?

               DONNIE
     Where it came from?

               EDDIE
     No... apparently they can't tell us what
     happened yet. Something about a matching
     serial number that got burned.
          (beat)
     But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't
     talk to anyone about it.

               DONNIE
     So we're not supposed to tell anybody what
     nobody knows?

               EDDIE
     You tell Dr. Thurman whatever you want.

Suddenly, Eddie slams on the brakes and the station wagon comes
to a sudden stop.

               EDDIE (cont'd)
     Oh, shit!

               DONNIE
     Grandma Death.

Standing in the road directly in front of the car is Roberta
Sparrow (101 years old, a.k.a. Grandma Death).

Grandma Death lives in a modest brick house that sits back in
a huge grassy field that overlooks the entire town. Her mailbox
sits on the edge of Old Gun Road.


EXT. OLD GUN ROAD - NEXT

Donnie gets out of the car and takes Grandma Death's hand,
walking her back towards her mailbox. He opens it for her.

               DONNIE
     No mail today.
          (smiles)
     Maybe tomorrow.

Grandma Death smiles back at him... and begins to walk slowly back
to her house. She then turns and takes Donnie's hands into her
frail grip.

               GRANDMA DEATH
          (speaking slowly)
     Every living creature... on this earth...
          (beat)
     ...dies alone.

Donnie stands there silently for a moment, and then Grandma Death
turns back towards her house.


EXT. DR. THURMAN'S RANCH - SUNSET

We see a large colonial rancher in the distance.


INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - EVENING

Dr. Lilian Thurman (fifty-eight) is a beautiful older woman.

               DR. THURMAN
     Your mother said that you've been
     skipping cycles of your medication.

               DONNIE
     I've been taking it. I just like to make
     her feel guilty for all of this. You know,
     abuse her. Psychologically.

               DR. THURMAN
     All of this... certainly isn't your
     mother's fault, Donald.

He is quiet for a moment.

               DONNIE
     So, I met a new friend.

               DR. THURMAN
     Would you like to talk about this friend?

               DONNIE
     His name is Frank.

               DR. THURMAN
     Frank.

               DONNIE
     I think he saved my life.

               DR. THURMAN
     How so?

               DONNIE
     Don't you watch the news?

               DR. THURMAN
     I don't own a television.

               DONNIE
     A jet engine fell on my house... landed on
     my bed. While I was talking to Frank on
     the golf course.

Dr. Thurman looks at him for a long beat, analysing whether or not
he is telling her the truth.

               DONNIE (cont'd)
     I'm not kidding.

Concerned, Dr. Thurman leans in closer.

               DR. THURMAN
     Frank... instructed you... to get out of
     bed... just before this happened.

               DONNIE
     He said to follow him.

               DR. THURMAN
     Follow him where?

               DONNIE
     Into the future.
          (beat)
     Then he said that the world was coming to
     an end.

He rubs his arm, where the numbers are still lightly drawn.

               DR. THURMAN
     Do you believe that the world is coming
     to an end?

               DONNIE
          (long beat)
     No.
          (beat)
     That's stupid.


INT. MIDDLESEX RIDGE SCHOOL - HALLWAY

In the empty school hallway... a gigantic tidal wave forms in the
distance and comes crashing towards us between the lockers.


INT. FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT (EARLY TUESDAY MORNING, 2 A.M.)

Donnie lies on the couch... fast asleep. His eyes slowly open.

There, standing in the corner of the room in the shadows is Frank.

       FRANK
     Wake up, Donnie.


INT. MIDDLESEX RIDGE SCHOOL - NIGHT

In the dark school hallway, Donnie rounds the corner with a
flashlight, a can of spray paint, and an axe. Frank stands in the
same hallway where the tidal wave crashed.


INT. SCHOOL BASEMENT - NEXT

Donnie shines the flashlight through the basement. He approaches
some old piping.

Donnie puts the axe back over his shoulder and then lowers it
fiercely. The smashing of metal against metal echoes through the
huge room.

EXT. BUS STOP - MORNING (7:45 A.M.)

The same group stands and waits for the bus. The guy smoke.
Cherita stands alone. Samantha is reading something to Joanie.

               SAMANTHA
          (reading)
     "And then the prince was led into a world
     of strange and beautiful magic."

               JOANIE
     Wow.

Donnie grabs the piece of paper from his sister.

               DONNIE
          (reading out loud)
     "The Last Unicorn!" By Samantha Darko.

               SAMANTHA
     Donnie! Give it back!

He pushes her away.

               SAMANTHA (cont'd)
     You're wrinkling it!

               SEAN
     Hey, it's 7:45. The bus shoulda been here,
     like, twenty minutes ago.

               RONALD
     Maybe Martha Moo finally went nuts and
     hijacked the bus.

               SEAN
          (excited)
     You know, there's, like, this rule. We get
     to go home at 7:55.

               RONALD
     There's no rule!

               SEAN
     Fuck yeah there is! If the bus doesn't
     show up in thirty minutes, you're supposed
     to go straight home.

               DONNIE
     Yeah... he's right. Because if we keep
     waiting, some guy in a van might pull up
     and try to molest us. And then our parents
     could sue the school board.

Everyone starts to get excited... looking down the road to see if
the bus is coming.

Sean's watch hits 7:55. No bus.

               SEAN
     All right! 7:55. Everybody goes home.

               RONALD
     Let's go to Donnie's house. His parents
     are both at work.

The three guys begin walking.

               DONNIE
     Come on, Sam, you can call Joanie's mom
     from home.

The two girls follow them. Cherita stands at the corner.

               DONNIE (cont'd)
     Hey, Cherita... you should go home.

               SEAN
     Yeah, if you're still here and the bus
     comes, we'll get in trouble.

               CHERITA
     Chut up.

               SEAN
     Hey, porky pig. I hope you get molested!

Suddenly, Emily Bates (ten) and Susie Bates (eight) run up to the
bus stop.

               EMILY
     Hey! Our mom said that school is cancelled
     today because it's flooded!

               JOANIE
     No... way.

A horrible expression appears on Donnie's face.


INT. MIDDLESEX RIDGE SCHOOL - MORNING

A janitor named Leroy (fifty-five) stands at the end of the hall
with Principal Cole. Water rushes past their feet down the steps.

               LEROY
     I got twelve classrooms full of water. All
     coming from a busted water main.

               PRINCIPAL COLE
     What else?

               LEROY
     What else? Shit, Principal Cole, you ain't
     gonna believe what else.


EXT. BACK COURTYARD - MORNING

They stand before the bronze Middlesex mongrel. Spray-painted on
the concrete before it is the phrase: THEY MADE ME DO IT.

There are papers strewn everywhere. Embedded in the head of the
mongrel is an axe.

               PRINCIPAL COLE
     Christ. Is that an axe?

               LEROY
     Yep.

               PRINCIPAL COLE
     How did this happen?

               LEROY
          (beat)
     I guess they made him do it.

Leroy can't help himself. He has to laugh.

               PRINCIPAL COLE
      You're fired.

Principal Cole walks off.


EXT. BUS STOP 2 - EARLY MORNING (8:15 A.M.)

Donnie, Sean, Ronald, Samantha and Joanie, Emily and Susie walk
from their bus stop.

               RONALD
     School's closed! Everybody go home!

               EMILY
     Nuh-uh.

               SAMANTHA
     Yeah-huh. A cat burglar broke him and
     trashed everything.

Susie talks with Emily. Joanie and Samantha listen in.

               EMILY
     Mom said that the boys' locker room looked
     like a swimming pool... and that they
     found faeces everywhere.

               SUSIE
     What are faeces?

               EMILY
     Baby mice.

               SUSIE
     Aww.

               JOANIE
     Oh my God, that is so grody.


EXT. BUS STOP 3 - NEXT

Sean looks down to another bus stop down the street.

               SEAN
     School's cancelled!

A bunch of young kids scream out... jumping up and down.


EXT. BUS STOP 4 - NEXT

Donnie approaches another corner alone. Ricky Danforth (seventeen)
and Seth Devlin (eighteen) stand with Gretchen.

               SETH
          (smoking a cigarette)
     Has anyone ever told you that you're sexy?

               RICKY
     I like your boobs.

Gretchen looks at them with disgust.

Donnie walks into the group.

               DONNIE
     Hey...

               GRETCHEN
     Hey...

               DONNIE
     School's cancelled.

They look at one another, surprised.

               GRETCHEN
          (to Donnie)
     Wanna walk me home?

               DONNIE
     Sure.

They quickly begin to walk off. Seth and Ricky look off at them,
furious.

               GRETCHEN
     Don't look so freaked.

               DONNIE
     I'm not. But you should check your
     backpack 'cause those guys like to steal
     shit.

               GRETCHEN
     Fuck them.

Gretchen smiles at Donnie, and then turns back and gives them the
middle finger.


EXT. NEIGHBOURHOOD STREET - NEXT (8:30 A.M.)

Donnie and Gretchen walk along the sidewalk together.

               DONNIE
     So... you just moved here?

               GRETCHEN
     Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has
     a restraining order against my stepdad.
          (beat)
     He has... emotional problems.

               DONNIE
     Oh, I... have those too.
          (beat)
     What kind of problems does your dad have?

               GRETCHEN
          (long beat)
     He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.

Donnie is shocked.

               DONNIE
     Wow. Did he go to jail?

               GRETCHEN
     He fled. They still can't find him.
          (beat)
     My mom and I had to change our names
     and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded
     kind of cool.

               DONNIE
     I'm sorry. I was in jail once.
          (beat)
     I accidentally burned down this house. It
     was abandoned. I got held back in school
     again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.
          (babbling)
     I think when I grow up I want to be a
     painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both.
     Then I'll write a book and draw the
     illustrations like a comic book. You know,
     change things.

               GRETCHEN
     Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like
     a superhero.

               DONNIE
     What makes you think I'm not?

Gretchen smiles. She looks over at her house.

               GRETCHEN
     I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says
     I have to write an essay on the greatest
     invention ever to benefit mankind.

               DONNIE
     That's easy. Antiseptics.

She gives him a look.

               DONNIE (cont'd)
     I mean, the whole sanitation thing.
     Joseph Lister... 1895. Before antiseptics
     there was no sanitation, especially in
     medicine.

               GRETCHEN
     You mean soap?

               DONNIE
     Don't knock soap. Without it, disease
     would spread rapidly. If we ran out...
     you and I would never live to see the
     year 2000.

               GRETCHEN
     Wonder where we'll be then.

               DONNIE
     The best thing about soap is that it's the
     only thing on earth that can never get
     dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it
     ...it always rubs off. And there it is
     again... perfect.

               GRETCHEN
     Until it withers away.

She stares at him for a moment.

               DONNIE
     It's a good thing the school was flooded
     today.

               GRETCHEN
     Why is that?

               DONNIE
     We never would have had this conversation.

She smiles.

               GRETCHEN
     You're weird.

               DONNIE
     I'm sorry.

       GRETCHEN
     That was a compliment.

       DONNIE
     Will you go with me?

       GRETCHEN
     Where are we going?

       DONNIE
     No... I mean, will you GO with me?
     That's like... what they call it here.
     Going together.

       GRETCHEN
          (beat)
     Sure.

She gets up and begins to walk up the hill.

               DONNIE
     Where are you going?

               GRETCHEN
     I'm going home.

INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - EVENING (THURSDAY, 6 P.M.)

Dr. Thurman sits next to Donnie. His eyes are closed.

               DR. THURMAN
     And when I clap my hands twice, you will
     wake up. Do you understand?

               DONNIE
     Yes.

               DR. THURMAN
     So, tell me about your day, Donald.

               DONNIE
     I met a girl.

               DR. THURMAN
     What is her name?

               DONNIE
     Gretchen. We're going together now.

               DR. THURMAN
     Do you think a lot about girls?

               DONNIE
     Yes.

               DR. THURMAN
     How are things going at school?

               DONNIE
     I think about girls a lot.

               DR. THURMAN
     I asked you about school.

               DR. THURMAN
     I think about.. fucking a lot during school.

               DR. THURMAN
     What else do you think about during school?

               DONNIE
     I think... about... "Who's the Boss?"

               DR. THURMAN
     Who is the boss?

               DONNIE
     I just turn the volume down and think
     about fucking Alyssa Milano.

               DR. THURMAN
     What about your family, Donnie?

               DONNIE
     No, I don't think about fucking my family.
     That's sick!

               DR. THURMAN
     Donnie... I want to hear about your friend
     Frank.

Donnie is now undoing his belt. He is no longer paying attention.

Dr. Thurman quickly claps her hands. Donnie jolts awake...
disoriented.


INT. ENGLISH CLASS - DAY (FRIDAY, 8:30 A.M.)

Donnie sits with his eyes wide open, staring at something.

               POLICE OFFICER
          (out of shot)
     Aaron Armitage... Cherita Chen.

Donnie's face has gone white.

               PRINCIPAL COLE
     Donald Darko.

We reveal on the blackboard the phrase, "They made me do it",
written over and over again.

We reveal two Police Officers standing next to Principal Cole in
the corner of the classroom.

Donnie gets up and walks over to the board and writes the phrase.

He then sits down again without hesitation.

The Police Officer hesitates for a moment, lingering over Donnie's
penmanship. He then places a '?' next to Donnie's name on the
roster. Ms. Pomeroy makes eye-contact with him.


INT. HEALTH CLASS - AFTERNOON (FRIDAY, 1 P.M.)

We pull back from a television: a cloud formation blows across the
screen revealing a logo that reads: CUNNING VISIONS PRODUCTIONS.
A series of interviews follows.. infomercial style.

               LINDA CONNIE
     And what I realised was that my entire
     life I was a victim of my own FEAR. I was
     FEEDING FEAR WITH FOOD... and finally... I
     looked in the mirror. Not just IN THE
     MIRROR. I looked THROUGH the mirror. And
     in that image I saw my EGO REFLECTION.

Donnie's health class is assembled in uniform rows in front of a
television cart. Ms. Farmer paces in front of them.

               SHANDA RIESMAN
          (with her arm around
      her geeky son)
     ...and for two years I thought it was
     NORMAL for a fifteen-year-old to wet the
     bed.

Laughter from the students.

               MS. FARMER
     QUIET!

               SHANDA RIESMAN
          (choking up)
     We tried everything. But the solution was
     there... all along.

               LARRY RIESMAN
          (burst out emotionally)
     I'm not AFRAID anymore!

A montage of "family" imagery follows.

               NARRATOR
     All across America... people have come
     together to join hands. People who believe
     that human life is too important... too
     valuable to be controlled by FEAR.

A middle-aged man walks out onto a country patio. It is Jim
Cunningham... the guy from the golf course.

               JIM CUNNINGHAM
     Hello. My name is Jim Cunningham. And
     welcome to "Controlling Fear".

The title CONTROLLING FEAR appears on the screen... followed by
PART ONE: ATTITUDINAL BELIEFS.

               FRANK (V.O.)
     Pay close attention, you could miss
     something.

Donnie stares at the screen... at Jim Cunningham.


EXT. OLD GUN RUINS - AFTERNOON (FRIDAY MAGIC HOUR, 4:30 P.M.)

The ruins of a brick chimney sit in the middle of a field. Donnie,
Sean and Ronald have lined up several empty beer bottles, cans and
stuffed animals on the hearth.

They take turns blasting these targets with a BB gun.

Blam! A can falls over. Ronald hands the gun to Donnie. Sean pulls
out a bottle of Raspberry Night Train and takes a sip. He hands
the bottle to Ronald.

               RONALD
     What is this shit?

               SEAN
     Raspberry.

He takes a big sip... which results in a dry heave.

               RONALD
     Raspberry. That's good shit.

Donnie aims the crosshairs on Smurfette's head. He pulls the
trigger. Smurfette falls over.

               RONALD (cont'd)
     Wicked.

               SEAN
     No more fuckin' for her.

               RONALD
     Smurfette doesn't fuck.

               SEAN
     Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other
     smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her,
     'cause the other smurfs were getting too
     horny.

               RONALD
     Not Vanity. He's a homo.

Blam! A bottle shatters.

               SEAN
     Then she fucks 'em all while Vanity
     watches. And Papa Smurf films it.

Ronald takes another sip of Night Train... followed by another dry
heave. Blam! A bottle breaks.

               DONNIE
     First of all... Papa Smurf didn't create
     Smurfette. Gargamel did. She was sent in
     as Gargemel's evil spy, with the intention
     of destroying the smurf village. But the
     overwhelming Goodness of the Smurf Way of
     Life transformed her into the Smurfette
     we all know and love. And as for the whole
     gang-bang scenario... it just couldn't
     happen. Smurfs are asexual. They probably
     don't even have reproductive organs down
     there under those little white pants. The
     only reason they exist is because of
     magic spells and witchcraft... which is
     all a bunch of bullshit if you ask me.
          (beat)
     That's what's so illogical about the
     smurfs... what's the point of living if
     you don't have a dick?

Donnie aims the gun... pulls the trigger. Blam! A bottle breaks.

               RONALD
     Dammit, Donnie! Why do you always
     gotta get all smart on us!

Donnie takes the bottle of Night Train and takes a small sip.

Their conversation is interrupted by the squealing of tyres.


EXT. OLD GUN ROAD - NEXT (MAGIC HOUR, 5 P.M.)

Down the hill, a Dodge minivan is stopped on Old Gun Road.
Grandma Death is once again in the middle of the street.

               DONNIE
     Grandma Death.

Ms. farmer leans her head out of the window.

               MS. FARMER
     Excuse me!

Grandma Death doesn't hear her. She wanders around in circles.
Furious, Ms. Farmer gets out of the car and walks over to the old
woman, walking her by the shoulders back to her driveway.

               MS. FARMER (cont'd)
     Please stay out of the road, Ms. Sparrow.
     If this happens again, I'm going to call
     social services.

Ms. Farmer gets back behind the wheel and they drive off.

Grandma Death lurks around her mailbox.

               RONALD
     How old is Grandma Death?

               DONNIE
     A hundred and one, I think. Every day she
     does the same thing. But there's never
     any mail.

Grandma Death approaches the mailbox.

               SEAN
     Here we go... this could be it.

She opens it... then closes it. Walks away.

               RONALD
     Awwww. That sucks.

She approaches the box again...

               SEAN
     Wait a minute... we may still have mail...

Opens it... closes it. Walks away.

               RONALD
     Noooo!

They continue to watch her, sipping liquor into the sunset, as
Grandma Death repeats this act like an ancient wind-up doll.


INT. FAMILY ROOM - EVENING (FRIDAY, 7 P.M.)

Donnie lies on the couch watching television... where there is a
news story about the flooded school. Several construction workers
are packing up their things.


INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER (7:15 P.M.)

Looking nauseous, Donnie opens the medicine cabinet and retrieves
his pills. He takes four of them. Donnie takes a drink of water,
closing his eyes. He puts the pills back and closes the cabinet.

In the mirror's reflection is Frank. Donnie jumps.

               FRANK
     You got away with it. Don't worry.

Donnie reaches his hand out towards Frank and it presses against
an invisible wall, as if he were pressing his hand against liquid
glass.

               DONNIE
     How can you do that?

               FRANK
     I can do anything I want... and so can
     you...

Donnie stares closely at Frank. He then removes his hands and moves
back away from him.


EXT. MIDDLESEX SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - EVENING (7:15 P.M.)

A sign reads: EMERGENCY PTA MEETING TONIGHT.


INT. AUDITORIUM - EVENING (7:15 P.M.)

Parents and teachers convene in front of the auditorium entrance.
Kitty Farmer hands out Xeroxed images of something.

Eddie and Rose chit-chat with other concerned parents.

Ms. Pomeroy approaches Kitty Farmer.

               MS. POMEROY
     What are you trying to accomplish here?

               MS. FARMER
          (indignant)
     There was urine and faeces flooded in my
     office.


INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER ON

The crowd settles... Principal Cole takes the stage.

               PRINCIPAL COLE
     In co-operation with the county police,
     we have begun an active investigation
     into the cause of the flooding... and our
     suspects include several of our own
     students.

Kitty Farmer stands up in her seat near the front row.

               MS. FARMER
     I want to know why this FILTH is being
     taught to our children.

The crowd stirs.

               PRINCIPAL COLE
     Kitty, I would appreciate... if you
     could wait...

               MS. FARMER
     Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER...
     but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex
     child. Therefore, I am the ONLY person
     here who transcends the parent-teacher
     bridge.

               PRINCIPAL COLE
     Kitty...

               MS. FARMER
     The bottom line... Mr. Cole... is that
     there is material being taught to our
     children that is cause for this
     destructive behaviour.

She stands up.

               MS. FARMER (cont'd)
     I have in my hand Graham Greene's "The
     Destructors". This short story is part of
     my daughter's English assignment. In this
     story, several children destroy an elderly
     man's house from inside out. They destroy
     his house without motive, without moral
     consequence. They destroy private property
     ...and they get away with it.

Ms. Pomeroy shakes her head bitterly.

               MS. FARMER (cont'd)
     And how do they do this? They FLOOD the
     house... by breaking through the water
     main!

               PRINCIPAL COLE
          (trying to calm her)
     This meeting of the PTA was called to
     inform the parents of our ongoing
     investigation...

               MS. FARMER
          (enraged)
     I AM THE PTA! And I say that this FILTH is
     directly related to this vandalism.

Applause from the crowd.

               MS. FARMER (cont'd)
     I think this garbage should be removed.

Several shouts of approval come from the crowd.


INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - EVENING

Donnie continues to converse with Frank.

               DONNIE
     Why did you make me flood the school?

               FRANK
     We just want to guide you in the
     right direction.

               DONNIE
     Who is... we?

               FRANK
     You'll know soon enough.

               DONNIE
          (desperate)
     Where did you come from?

               FRANK
          (beat)
     Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?

A moment of silence.

               SAMANTHA
     Who are you talking to?

Donnie turns to see Samantha is standing in the doorway. Frank
is gone.


INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

A heated debate among the parents is under way. Frustrated, Rose
stands up. Karen Pomeroy is furious.

               ROSE
     Excuse me... but what is the real issue
     here? The PTA doesn't ban books from
     school.

               MS. FARMER
     The PTA is here to acknowledge that there
     is pornography in our school's
     curriculum.

               MS. POMEROY
          (standing up)
     My GOD... woman, are you drunk?

               MS. FARMER
     Excuse me? You need to go back to grad
     school.

               ROSE
          (to Kitty)
     Do you even know who Graham Greene is?

               MS. FARMER
          (to Rose)
     I think we've all seen "Bonanza".

Ms. Pomeroy is disgusted. Rose and Eddie burst out laughing, grab
their coats, and leave.


EXT. WIZARD'S ARCADE - AFTERNOON (SATURDAY, 1 P.M.)

Donnie and Gretchen play a Sega race-car driving game. Donnie
drives a souped-up red Ferrari through the Grand Canyon.

               GRETCHEN
     So when you sleepwalk, can you remember
     afterward? Like, do you dream?

               DONNIE
     No. I just wake up and I look around, try
     to figure out where I am... how I got
     there.

               GRETCHEN
     My dad said never wake a sleepwalker...
     because they could drop dead.

The Trans-Am crashes head on into a tree. Game Over.

               DONNIE
     It's like this big force... that's in
     your brain. But sometimes it grows
     bigger... and it spread down into your
     arms and legs... and it just sends you
     someplace.

               GRETCHEN
     So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere
     familiar?

               DONNIE
     No. Every time I wake up somewhere
     different. Sometimes my bike is laying
     there next to me. Like once when I woke
     up on the edge of this cliff up on
     Carpathian Ridge.

               GRETCHEN
     And you'd never been there before?

They sit silently for a moment.

               GRETCHEN (cont'd)
     Donnie?

               DONNIE
     Yeah?

               GRETCHEN
     Do you ever feel as though there's
     always someone watching you?

               DONNIE
     Why?

               GRETCHEN
     Well... maybe someone is, like... giving
     you these dream steroids. And sleepwalking
     ...is someone showing you the way.

Title card:

               OCTOBER 13 1988


INT. ENGLISH CLASS - MORNING (THURSDAY, 8 A.M.)

Donnie stands in front of the class. Ms. Pomeroy sits behind her
desk. On the chalkboard is "Poetry Day".

               DONNIE
     "A storm is coming, Frank says. A storm
     that will swallow the children... and I
     will deliver them from the kingdom of
     pain."
          (beat)
     "I will deliver the children to their
     doorsteps. I will send the monsters back
     to the underground. I will send them
     back to a place where no one can see them
     ...except for me. Because I am Donnie
     Darko."

Donnie returns to his seat. Ms. Pomeroy stares at him intensely.

               MS. POMEROY
     Who is Frank?

               DONNIE
     A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.

The class begins to laugh. Donnie looks over at Gretchen.


INT. HEALTH CLASS - AFTERNOON (THURSDAY, 1 P.M.)

Ms. Farmer stands next to the television where Jim Cunningham
narrates the Lifeline tutorial.

               JIM CUNNINGHAM
     And so, let us begin Lifeline Exercise
     No. 1.

"PLEASE PRESS STOP NOW" appears on the screen.

Ms. Farmer stops the tape and moves to the blackboard. On it, she
has drawn a horizontal line book-ended by the words "Love" and
"Fear".

               MS. FARMER
     As you can see, the Lifeline is controlled
     by two polar extremes: "Fear" and "Love".
     Fear is in the negative energy spectrum.
     Love is in the positive energy spectrum.

               SEAN
          (to Donnie)
     No duh.

               MS. FARMER
     Excuse me?
          (defensive)
     "No duh" is a product of fear.

She stares them down for a moment... shaking her head.

               MS. FARMER (cont'd)
          (handing out cards)
     Now, on each card is a CHARACTER DILEMMA
     which applies to the Lifeline. Please read
     each character dilemma aloud... and place
     an X on the Lifeline in the appropriate
     place.

The students read their cards.

               KITTY FARMER (cont'd)
     We'll start in the front.

Cherita Chen stands up and walks over to the blackboard. Ms.
Farmer pulls up large white cards that have black-and-white
animated cartoons on them.

               CHERITA
     Juanita has an important maths test
     today. She has known about the test for
     several weeks, but has not studied. In
     order to keep from failing her class,
     Juanita decides that she will cheat on
     the maths test.

Cherita places an X near the "Fear" end of the lifeline.

               MS. FARMER
     Good. Next.

Donnie watches as several more students interpret their
respective human dilemmas.

Finally... it is his turn.

               DONNIE
     Ling Ling finds a wallet on the ground
     filled with money. She takes the wallet
     to the address on the driver's license
     but keeps the money inside the wallet.

Donnie looks at the blackboard.

               DONNIE (cont'd)
     I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't
     get this.

               MS. FARMER
          (impatient)
     Just place an X in the appropriate place
     on the Lifeline.

               DONNIE
     I just don't get this. Everything can't be
     lumped into two categories. That's too
     simple.

               MS. FARMER
     The Lifeline is divided that way.

               DONNIE
     Well, life isn't that simple. So what if
     Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the
     wallet? That has nothing to do with either
     fear or love.

               MS. FARMER
          (impatient)
     Fear and love are the deepest of human
     emotions.

               DONNIE
     Well, yeah... OK, but you're not listening
     to me. There are other things that need
     to be taken into account here. Like the
     whole spectrum of human emotion. You're
     just lumping everything into these two
     categories... and, like, denying
     everything else.

Ms. Farmer stares at Donnie vehemently. She can't believe what
she's hearing.

               DONNIE (cont'd)
     People aren't that simple.

               MS. FARMER
          (not knowing how to argue
     with him)
     If you don't complete the assignment,
     you'll get a zero for the day.

Donnie thinks for a moment... and then raises his hand.


INT. PRINCIPAL COLE'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON (2 P.M.)

Donnie and his parents sit in front of Principal Cole.

               PRINCIPAL COLE
     Donald... let me preface this by saying
     that your Iowa scores are...
          (looking down at the file)
     ...intimidating.
          (rubbing his temples)
     So... let's go over this again. What
     exactly did you say to Ms. Farmer?

Donnie does not answer. We reveal Ms. Farmer standing in the corner.

               MS. FARMER
          (furious)
     He asked me to... forcibly insert the
     Lifeline exercise card into my anus.

Silence. Rose looks down, furious. Eddie lets out a snort laugh
which he tries to conceal with a cough. It doesn't work.


INT. TEACHERS' LOUNGE / OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER (2:15 P.M.)

Eddie and Donnie exit Cole's office, moving on while Rose
approaches Kitty, who looks visibly shaken.

               ROSE
     Kitty, I don't know what to say. They've
     suspended him for two days.
          (beat)
     Ever since this jet fiasco, I honestly
     don't know what has gotten into him.

               MS. FARMER
     Rose, I'll tell you this because our
     daughters have been on dance team
     together for two years and I respect
     you as  WOMAN. But after witnessing your
     son's behaviour today, I have...
     significant doubts...
          (stopping herself)
     Our paths through life must be righteous.
     I urge you to go home and look in the
     mirror and pray that your son does not
     succumb to the path of fear.

Kitty Farmer turns and walks away.


EXT. DARKO BACKYARD / PATIO - SUNSET (MAGIC HOUR, 5:30 P.M.)

Samantha jumps up and down on the trampoline.


INT. DONNIE'S ROOM - NIGHT (5:30 P.M.)

Donnie walks into his room again for the first time since the
accident, looking around at the new furniture, paint and carpet.
Everything is perfect.

Elizabeth appears in the doorway behind him with a cordless
phone in her hand.

               ELIZABETH
          (into the phone)
     Oh my God, remember that gym teacher,
     Ms. Farmer?
          (beat)
     Yeah. Well, I guess my brother called her
     a fat bitch today in class and got
     suspended. And my parents just bought him
     all of this new shit.
          (beat)
     Yeah, I know. I wish a jet engine would
     have fallen on my room.


INT. MARINO'S ITALIAN BISTRO - NIGHT (6 P.M.)

Eddie and Rose sit across from one another at the bistro patio...
having a quiet dinner to themselves.

               ROSE
     He's too old to be behaving this way.

Eddie considers this.

               EDDIE
     Oh, I say we buy him a moped.


INT. DONNIE'S ROM - NIGHT (7 P.M.)

Donnie lies in bed... looking up at the ceiling. He then rolls
over and looks at the calendar on his wall. The days of the month
of October are marked off with an X in each square. Tacked onto
the calendar is a drawing of Frank.

               DONNIE
     28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, 12 seconds.


INT. PHYSICS CLASS - DAY (FRIDAY, 2:30 P.M.)

As everyone is leaving class, Donnie stays behind.

               DONNIE
     Dr. Monnitoff?

               DR. MONNITOFF
     Donnie.

               DONNIE
     I know that this is gonna sound kinda
     weird... but do you know anything about
     time travel?

Dr. Monnitoff pauses, turns and looks at Donnie. He seems to
know something.


INT. PHYSICS CLASS - LATER ON

Dr. Monnitoff has drawn a diagram on the blackboard. In his hand
he holds a copy of Stephen Hawking's "A Brief History of Time".

               DR. MONNITOFF
     So... according to Hawking... wormholes
     might be able to provide a shot cut for
     jumping between two distant regions of
     space-time.

               DONNIE
     So... in order to travel back in time,
     you'd have to have a big spaceship or
     something that can travel faster than the
     speed of light --

               DR. MONNITOFF
     Theoretically.

               DONNIE
     -- and be able to find one of these
     wormholes.

               DR. MONNITOFF
     A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge,
     which is, theoretically... a wormhole in
     space controlled by man.

               DONNIE
     So... that's it?

               DR. MONNITOFF
     The basic principles of time travel are
     there.
       (beat)
     So you have the vessel and the portal.
     And the vessel can be anything. Most
     likely a spacecraft.


EXT. SCHOOL COURTYARD - NEXT

Cherita Chen listens to this conversation intently.


INT. PHYSICS CLASS - NEXT

               DONNIE
     Like a DeLorean.

               DR. MONNITOFF
          (smiling)
     A metal craft of any kind.

Donnie stares at him intently. Dr. Monnitoff walks over to his
desk and picks up a book.

               DR. MONNITOFF (cont'd)
     Don't tell anybody that I gave you this.
          (beat)
     The woman who wrote it... used to teach
     here a long time ago. She was a nun for
     many years and then overnight she just
     became this entirely different person. She
     up and left the Church, wrote this book,
     and started teaching science.

Donnie takes the battered book... we see the cover.


INT. SCHOOL MAIN HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Donnie stands before an array of old photographs. We zoom in to
a black-and-white photograph of a young Robert Sparrow standing
in a class photograph dated 1944.

Donnie looks down at the book, and then at the photograph.

               DONNIE
     Roberta Sparrow... Grandma Death.


INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT (FRIDAY, 6 P.M.)

Donnie sits down for dinner with his family.

               DONNIE
     It's called "The Philosophy of Time
     Travel".

               ELIZABETH
     What does time travel have to do with
     philosophy?

               DONNIE
     Guess who wrote it?

No one seems to know.

               DONNIE (cont'd)
     Grandma Death.

               ROSE
     That is a terrible nickname.

               EDDIE
     Grandma Death.

               DONNIE
          (to Eddie)
     You know, Roberta Sparrow. We almost hit
     her with the car the other day.

               ROSE
     I've heard she's loaded.

The family is taken aback.

               EDDIE
     You're right. Roberta Sparrow was famous
     for her gem collections. Kids used to try
     and steal stuff from her all the time.
     Over the years... as she got older, she
     became more and more of a recluse... now
     she just likes to stay up there all by
     herself.

               DONNIE
     I guess she just lost faith in the world.


EXT. DARKO BACKYARD - SUNSET (SATURDAY, 5:30 P.M.)

Slow motion. Donnie and Gretchen jump up and down on the
trampoline, lost among falling autumn leaves.


INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY (SUNDAY, 12 P.M.)

Donnie is back on Dr. Thurman's couch.

               DR. THURMAN
     How many times have you seen Frank?

               DONNIE
     Four times... so far.

               DR. THURMAN
     Can anyone else see him?

               DONNIE
     I don't think so. It's like a TV
     station. And they're tuned into mine and
     no one else's.

               DR. THURMAN
     Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger
     group?

               DONNIE
     I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That
     Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it
     was ridiculous.

               DR. THURMAN
     A sign from whom?

               DONNIE
          (changing the subject)
     I think that Frank wants me to go to this
     woman.
          (holding up the book)
     She wrote a book about time travel. Frank
     asked me if I believed in time travel.
     That can't just be a random coincidence.
          (beat)
     My dad almost hit her with the car the
     other day, and she said the creepiest
     thing. She said that every living creature
     on this earth dies alone.

               DR. THURMAN
     How does that make you feel?

               DONNIE
     It reminded me of my dog Callie.

               DR. THURMAN
     Is Callie still around?

               DONNIE
     No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't
     find her for days. She went and crawled
     underneath our back porch...

               DR. THURMAN
     Do you feel alone right now?

He looks at her for a moment.

               DONNIE
     I'd like to believe that I'm not... but
     I've just never seen any proof. So I just
     choose not to bother with it. It's, like,
     I could spend my whole life thinking
     about it... debating it in my head.
     Weighing the pros and cons. And in the
     end, I still wouldn't have any proof. So
     ...I don't even debate it any more.
     Because it's absurd.
          (beat)
     I don't want to be alone.
          (beat)
     So, does that make me, like, an atheist?

               DR. THURMAN
     No. That makes you keep searching.

Donnie takes this in for a moment.


INT. FAMILY ROOM - EVENING (SUNDAY, 7:15 P.M.)

Eddie and Dr. Fisher watch the Redskins game. Ronald and Donnie
watch the game in the family room.

               EDDIE
     Ahh... we need Theisman.

               DR. FISHER
     We need a miracle.


INT. KITCHEN - NEXT

Rose and Anne Fisher (forty-five) share a bottle of wine at the
kitchen table.

               ANNE
     And so, his tapes made me realise that
     for forty-five years I have been a
     a prisoner of fear. Rose, you have to
     meet Jim Cunningham.
          (taking a sip of wine)
     I can't believe he's not married.

Samantha bounces through the kitchen and into the family room,
wearing a Dorothy outfit from "The Wizard of Oz".


INT. FAMILY ROOM - NEXT

Donnie sits back in the La-Z Boy, dozing off...

John Madden's CBS chalkboard unfolds on the TV screen. Madden
traces his electronic lines across the screen, tracing the
movement of the players... as their images are frozen in time.

Donnie's eyes close... and then re-open.

Donnie turns his head and sees that the room is momentarily
bathed in artificial white light, as if God hit the slow-motion
button during a flash of lightning.

Donnie turns his head and sees that protruding from his father's
stomach... is a thick spear made of silvery plastic gel.

As Eddie gets up from the couch to walk over to the refrigerator
...his spear precedes him... morphing into an extruded arrow
that reaches the refrigerator several seconds before him.

The spear traces the exact geography of his movement through
time... using his centre of gravity as its axis point.

Donnie turns and sees Samantha skipping from the kitchen... as her
spear bounces several feet in front of her like a caterpillar.
Her spear... smaller than her father's... is proportional to her
mass.

               SAMANTHA
          (her voice echoing through
      the silence)
     Follow the yellow brick road...

Donnie looks down at his stomach and sees his own spear protruding
outward. It then begins to extrude forward towards the foyer.

He does not follow it. It then retreats back in and beckons him
to follow.

Like a child transfixed by a firefly... Donnie follows the path of
his spear into the foyer.


INT. FOYER / UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NXT

Donnie and his spear round the corner and arrive in his parents'
bedroom.


INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

His spear leads him to the closet. He opens the closet door...
and the spear leads him down to a box hidden beneath his father's
shoe rack.

Donnie removes the box from the closet and unlatches it. Inside is
a gun. Donnie removes the pistol from the box... staring at it with
the same childlike expression.

Suddenly... Donnie's universe snaps back to normal. The white
light strobes... the spear has vanished.

Donnie still holds the gun. His expression changes to nervous
shock.

His eyes linger over the gun for a moment, he then quickly puts
it back in the box... and carefully places the box back under
the shoe rack.

EXT. BUS STOP - MORNING (TUESDAY, 7:30 A.M.)

The usual bus stop crew is there. Donnie arrives last... by
himself. He looks tired and preoccupied.

A plane flies overhead... they all look up at the sky.


INT. ENGLISH CLASS - MORNING (8:30 A.M.)

We see the students placing the Graham Greene books on Ms.
Pomeroy's desk.

               MS. POMEROY
     It gives me no pleasure to deny you
     the right to read one of the great
     writers of the twentieth century. But...
     alas, I have not yet been elected Queen of
     the Universe. And until that day, I will
     be forced to obey the rules... and so
     will you. So... if anyone is found
     carrying this book in school, they will
     be suspended.

Donnie slips his book into his backpack.

               MS. POMEROY (cont'd)
     But let's not worry. Someone has already
     pre-ordered several dozen copies at
     Sarasota Mall Waldenbooks. now, in Mr.
     Greene's absence, we will be reading
     another classic. Richard Adams' "Watership
     Down".

She begins to hand out copies of the paperback novel. Beth Farmer
smiles when she sees the cover.

               BETH
     Awww. Bunnies.

               MS. POMEROY
          (whispering in his ear)
     Donnie, maybe you and Frank can read
     this one together.


INT. SCHOOL BATHROOM - MIDDAY (11:30 A.M.)

Donnie walks along the edge of the school. Suddenly, a figure
approaches, grabbing him from behind, placing a switchblade next
to his throat It is Seth Devlin.

               SETH
     Did you tell them that I flooded
     the school?

               DONNIE
     I didn't say shit.

               SETH
     That's not what I heard. Now they think
     I did it.

               DONNIE
     Well, if you're innocent, then you have
     nothing to worry about.

               SETH
     You know what? I think that you did it.

Seth takes the knife and pokes the tip softly into the flesh of
Donnie's neck, drawing a small amount of blood.

He pushes Donnie away. Donnie touches his neck in shock.


INT. PHYSICS CLASS - DAY (2:30 P.M.)

Donnie walks into the classroom and takes his seat next to
Gretchen. He is sweating profusely.

Dr. Monnitoff is handing out papers. The bell rings People
shuffle out.

               DR. MONNITOFF
     Don't forget tomorrow we'll be meeting
     with our partners for the Young Inventors
     Fair.

Donnie rubs his finger over his neck wound.

               GRETCHEN
     What happened to your neck?

               DONNIE
     I don't want to talk about it.
          (changing the subject)
     So what happened to your neck?


EXT. GOLF COURSE FOREST - THAT AFTERNOON (3 P.M.)

Donnie and Gretchen walk around the trail.

               GRETCHEN
     Were you ever afraid of the dark?

They pull over to a stop.

               DONNIE
     Why?

She thinks for a moment.

               GRETCHEN
     Babies cry because they're afraid of the
     dark. And because they have no memories...
     for all they know... every night could be
     the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness.

               DONNIE
     Why not just buy your baby a night light?

               GRETCHEN
     That's not good enough. You've got to go
     back in time and take all those hours of
     darkness and pain and replace them... with
     whatever you wanted.

               DONNIE
     With, like, images?

               GRETCHEN
     Like... a Hawaiian sunset... the Grand
     Canyon. Things that remind you how
     beautiful the world can be.

Donnie stops and takes Gretchen's hand.

               DONNIE
     You know... we've been going together for
     a week and a half...

               GRETCHEN
     And what?

               DONNIE
     Well...

               GRETCHEN
     You want to kiss me...

Donnie goes in for an awkward kiss... but Gretchen turns and
denies him.

Donnie turns away, embarrassed.

               DONNIE
     That's alright... I understand.

               GRETCHEN
          (embarrassed)
     No... Donnie, wait. I've never...

               DONNIE
     I always wanted it to be at a time when
     ...when it reminds you how beautiful the
     world can be.

               GRETCHEN
     Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy
     over there watching us.

A man in a red jogging suit is standing there in the forest
smoking a cigarette. He turns away... disappearing into the woods.


EXT. NEIGHBOURHOOD STREET - LATER THAT AFTERNOON (4 P.M.)

Donnie rides along the sidewalk... and skids to a stop, seeing a
wallet lying there.

Donnie opens the wallet, looking at the ID. It reads:

                JIM CUNNINGHAM
       42 POWDERHAM DRIVE
       MIDDLESEX, VA 23113

               FRANK (V.O.)
          (echoing in Donnie's head)
     Now you know where he lives.

Donnie looks over and sees that he is in front of Cunningham's
Tudor mansion.


INT. KITCHEN - EVENING (7:15 P.M.)

Donnie sits at the kitchen island with Elizabeth, carving a
pumpkin.

               ELIZABETH
     So I hear you have a girlfriend.

               DONNIE
     Yeah.

               ELIZABETH
     What's her name?

               DONNIE
     You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?

               ELIZABETH
          (defensive)
     Why would I tell Mom?

               DONNIE
     Because you tell Mom everything.

               ELIZABETH
     No I don't.
          (long beat)
     She worries about you.

               DONNIE
     Well, don't worry... I'm taking my
     medication.

               ELIZABETH
     It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your
     teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me
     what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my
     ass off.

               DONNIE
     I was just being honest.

               ELIZABETH
     Yeah... well, that's not the way the world
     works. If you keep being too honest, the
     world will eventually find a way to
     destroy you.

               DONNIE
     Her name is Gretchen.

               ELIZABETH
     That's a nice name.
          (beat)
     OK, let me see it.

Donnie turns the carved jack o' lantern around and we see that it
looks remarkably like Frank.


INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - NIGHT (8 P.M.)

Rose and Eddie sit in front of Dr. Thurman.

               ROSE
     Thank you for seeing us... We... just felt
     that it was time to discuss...

               DR. THURMAN
     What I think is going on with your son.

               ROSE
     Well, you know about his past. And when
     you said to look for signs of aggression
     ...He was recently suspended from school
     for insulting his gym teacher.

               EDDIE
     She deserved it.

               DR. THURMAN
     Rose... let me just lay out what I believe
     is happening here. Donnie's aggressive
     behaviour seems to stem from his increased
     detachment from reality. His inability to
     cope with the forces in the world that he
     perceives to be threatening.

Rose smiles nervously.

               DR. THURMAN (cont'd)
     Has your son ever told you about Frank?

               ROSE
     Come again?

               DR. THURMAN
     Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?

               ROSE
     Frank?

               DR. THURMAN
     Donnie is experiencing what is commonly
     called a daylight hallucination.

               ROSE
     You're telling me my son has an imaginary
     friend?

               DR. THURMAN
     He has described lengthy conversations...
     physical encounters with what I believe to
     be a manifestation of his subconscious
     mind.

Rose looks over at Eddie with an expression of panic.

               ROSE
     I... What can we do?

               DR. THURMAN
     I would like to put him through more
     hypnotherapy... and increase his
     medication.

Eddie looks at Rose... who nods in approval.

               ROSE
     If that's what you think is necessary.

               DR. THURMAN
     But let me remind you that this treatment
     is... experimental.


INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Donnie walks into the kitchen and removes a butcher's knife from
a drawer.


INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - NIGHT

Donnie stands in front of the bathroom mirror... catatonic...
looking at his reflection.

Frank stands behind him.

Suddenly, Donnie turns around with the butcher's knife and lunges
at Frank with all of his weight.

The knife collides with Frank's invisible force field as if it
were liquid steel. Donnie lunges repeatedly at Frank with
psychotic rage... but the knife bounces off.

               OCTOBER 20 1988


INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - MORNING (10 A.M.)

The auditorium is packed with Middlesex mongrels. Jim Cunningham
takes the stage.

               JIM CUNNINGHAM
          (shouting)
     Good morning, mongrels!

               AUDIENCE
          (scattered voices)
     Good morning...

               JIM CUNNINGHAM
     That's all the gusta you can musta? I
     said, "Good morning!"

               AUDIENCE
          (yelling louder)
     Good MORNING!

               JIM CUNNINGHAM
     Now that's better... but I still sense
     some students out there... who are AFRAID
     ...just to say GOOD MORNING!

               AUDIENCE
          (screaming)
     GOOD MORNING!

               JIM CUNNINGHAM
     Are you AFRAID?

               AUDIENCE
          (screaming louder)
     GOOD MORNING!

               JIM CUNNINGHAM
     Now that's what I like to hear!
          (suddenly serious)
     Because too many young men and women today
     are paralysed by their fears. They give in
     to their feelings of self-doubt... they
     surrender their bodies to the temptations
     of drugs, alcohol and premarital sex.
     Empty solutions. These are toxic chemicals
     ...and disease-spreading behaviour.

A large screen lowers behind him.

               JIM CUNNINGHAM (cont'd)
     I would like tot ell you a story today
     about a young man whose life was destroyed
     by the instruments of fear. A young man
     searching for love... in all the wrong
     places.
          (shaking his head tragically)
     His name was Frank.

On the giant screen, an image slide appears of a young cartoon
teenager whose eyes are whacked out on drugs. The title appears:
HIS NAME WAS FRANK.

Upon hearing the name Frank, Donnie falls into a paranoid trance.

Gretchen, who looks extremely bored, leans over to Donnie.

               GRETCHEN
     Let's get out of here.

Donnie ignores her. His eyes are locked on Jim Cunningham, who
begins his rousing re-enactment of the sad, unfortunate downfall
of Frank.

Within minutes, Jim Cunningham has the crowd laughing...
enamoured of him with his cartoon slide show.

Note: during this sequence, the camera speed ramps to 4 bps.


INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - NEXT (10:30 A.M.)

Donnie is in a trance.

               DONNIE
     We're moving through time.

               GRETCHEN
     What?

The huge screen rises upwards and Jim Cunningham takes questions
from the crowd from portable mike stands in the back of the
auditorium.

Several students get up and go to the mikes.

               DORKY GIRL
     Hi. Um... my stepsister... like... I
     sometimes worry that she eats too much.

               OVERWEIGHT GIRL
          (mortified; yelling at her sister
      from the crowd)
     Shut up, Kim!

               DORKY GIRL
     I'm just trying to help you!

               JIM CUNNINGHAM
     There's no need to be embarrassed. Many
     times we eat because we are afraid to face
     the reality of our ego reflections. We
     shouldn't just look INTO the mirror. We
     should look THROUGH the mirror.

               DORKY GIRL
     Thanks.

Kitty Farmer runs out onto the stage and hands Jim Cunningham a
bottle of water and a towel. She gives him the thumbs-up sign, and
runs back offstage.

               LANKY KID
     Um... How can I decide what I want to be
     when I grow up?

               JIM CUNNINGHAM
     I think you should look deep within
     yourself... deep within your heart... and
     find what it is in the world that makes
     you feel LOVE. Just pure LOVE. And then
     go to that. In your studies... in your
     athletics... go towards love.

               LANKY KID
     Thank you.

Donnie gets up from his seat and goes to the mike.

               LARRY RIESMAN
     What can I do to learn how to fight?

               JIM CUNNINGHAM
     Violence is a product of fear. Those who
     love themselves enough should have no need
     to fight another person. Learn to truly
     love yourself... and the world will be
     yours.

               LARRY RIESMAN
     Okay.

Donnie steps up to the mike stand.

               DONNIE
          (furious)
     How much are they paying you to be here?

               JIM CUNNINGHAM
     Excuse me? What's your name, son?

               DONNIE
     Gerald.

               JIM CUNNINGHAM
     Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.

               DONNIE
     Well, Jim, I think you're full of shit!

There are rumblings from the faculty. Some laughter from the
student body.

               DONNIE (cont'd)
     Are you telling us this crap because you
     want us to buy your book? Because I'll
     tell you something, that was some of the
     worst advice I've ever heard!
          (to Dorky Girl)
     If you want your sister to lose weight...
     tell her to get off the couch, stop eating
     Twinkies... and maybe go out for field
     hockey.
       (to Lanky Kid)
     You're never gonna know what you want to
     be when you grow up. Most of the time,
     nobody does. How about you, Jim?
       (to Larry)
     And you... Sick of some jerk shoving your
     head in a toilet? Then go lift some
     weights... take a karate lesson. And when
     he tries to do it again... kick him in the
     balls.

More rumblings from the faculty... Laughter from the students gets
louder.

               JIM CUNNINGHAM
          (getting angry)
     I think you are afraid to ask me for
     advice. I think that you are a very
     troubled... confused young man. I think
     you're searching for answers in all the
     wrong places.

               DONNIE
          (long beat)
     Well, I think you're the fucking
     Anti-Christ.

The crowd is stirring. Students break out into applause. Principal
Cole approaches Donnie and removes him from the auditorium.

Gretchen watches him go with a smile.


EXT. OLD GUN ROAD - AFTERNOON (3:30 P.M.)

Donnie and Gretchen walk down the wooded road.

               DONNIE
          (mumbling)
     They suspended me for two days.

               GRETCHEN
          (stopping)
     Are you okay?

               DONNIE
          (long beat)
     I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really
     messed-up stuff.
          (beat)
     Do you know who Grandma Death is?

               GRETCHEN
     Who?

               DONNIE
     The old crazy woman who lives off Old
     Gun Road.

Donnie takes out the book by Roberta Sparrow.

               GRETCHEN
     Oh, yeah.
          (taking the book)
     "The Philosophy of Time Travel". What
     is this?

               DONNIE
     She wrote it.
          (beat)
     There are chapters in this book that
     describe the stuff I've been seeing. It
     can't just be a coincidence.
          (beat)
     Will you come see her with me?


EXT. OLD GUN ROAD - NEXT (3:45 P.M.)

Donnie and Gretchen stand at the end of Grandma Death's driveway.

Gretchen leads Donnie up to the front porch of the decrepit
house. She then rings the doorbell. They wait for several moments
...nothing happens.

Gretchen then goes and peers through a window.

               DONNIE
     I know she's here. She never leaves
     the house.

               GRETCHEN
     Maybe she's asleep.

They walk to the end of the driveway, and Donnie stops at the
mailbox. He opens it... empty.

               GRETCHEN (cont'd)
          (pointing at the house)
     Donnie, look.

In an upstairs window of the house, the silhouette of Grandma
Death peers down at them ominously.


INT. DONNIE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON

Donnie sits at his desk, sealing an envelope. The address reads:

       MS. ROBERTA SPARROW
                22 OLD GUN ROAD
       MIDDLESEX, VA 23113

Title card:

               OCTOBER 23 1988


INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - EVENING (6 P.M.)

Dr. Thurman looks at a diagram from Sparrow's boo. Donnie is
pacing around her office.

               DR. THURMAN
     And they grow out of our stomachs?

               DONNIE
     It was just like she described them in her
     book. Like they were alive. The way that
     they looked... moved... smelled. They
     were like workers... assigned to each one
     of us.
          (long beat, then distant)
     I followed my spear... and I found
     something...

               DR. THURMAN
     What did you find?

Donnie is silent for a moment.

               DONNIE
     Nothing.

               DR. THURMAN
     Have you told Gretchen about the spears?

               DONNIE
     Yeah, but if I told her about the other
     stuff about Frank...

               DR. THURMAN
     Are you embarrassed by these things that
     you see?

               DONNIE
     You know... every week I come in here and
     I tell you stuff... and it's all
     embarrassing. I tell you stuff that I
     don't tell anyone else... and you know
     what? It's your turn, Dr. Thurman. I'm
     not saying anything else until you tell me
     something embarrassing about yourself.

Donnie makes a "zipper lip" gesture.

               DR. THURMAN
          (long, stubborn beat)
     I once had an extended sexual fantasy
     involving Mr. Rogers.

Donnie just stares at her.

               DONNIE
     Whoa.
          (beat)
     That's OK, Dr. Thurman, it's nothing to
     be embarrassed about. I have sexual
     fantasies all the time too.

               DR. THURMAN
     I know.

               DONNIE
     I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let
     me kiss her. She says because it's our
     first kiss... she's, like, waiting for
     this big... moment or something. I just
     don't get it. I just want to get it over
     with so we can move on to the good stuff.

               DR. THURMAN
     The good stuff.

               DONNIE
     Yeah... you know...
          (whispering)
     Fucking.

               DR. THURMAN
          (cutting him off)
     Have you ever made love, Donald?

Donnie looks at her... and we know the answer.


INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT (7:15 P.M.)

The entire family is having dinner. Donnie is lost in a trance.

               SAMANTHA
     Donnie, are you coming to my talent
     show tomorrow?

Donnie ignores her.

               ROSE
     He can't, Samantha. He's been suspended
     from after-school activities. Donnie...
     are you still with us?
          (beat)
     How was your therapy session tonight?

               DONNIE
     Fine. You know, Dr. Thurman isn't so bad a
     lady. I can tell her anything.

Rose appears surprised and then sad at this comment. She looks at
Eddie, who just looks down at his plate of food.


EXT. PHYSICS CLASS - DAY (12 P.M.)

Donnie and Gretchen are at the front of the room, presenting their
invention. Dr. Monnitoff presides.

               DONNIE
     So, we call them... IMGs.

               GRETCHEN
     Infant Memory Generators.

               DONNIE
     Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy
     these glasses for your infant, and they
     wear them at night when they sleep.

               GRETCHEN
     And inside these glasses are these slide
     photographs. And each photograph is of
     something peaceful... or beautiful.
     Whatever pictures the parent wants to put
     inside.

               DR. MONNITOFF
     What effect do you think this would have
     on an infant?

               DONNIE
     Well... the thing is, nobody remembers
     their infancy. And anyone who says they do
     is lying. We think that this would help
     develop memory earlier in life.

               DR. MONNITOFF
     Did you stop and think that maybe infants
     need darkness? That darkness is part of
     their natural development.

Seth Davis raises his hand.

               SETH
      What if the parents, like... put in
      photographs of Satan... pentagrams, dead
      people... stuff like that?

               GRETCHEN
      Is that what you'd show your kids?

               SETH
      I mean, didn't your dad, like, stab your
      mom?

Dr. Monnitoff looks over at Seth calmly.

               SETH
      Get out.

Seth begins to walk out. Gretchen doesn't answer. There is only
the 80 IQ grin... staring back at her face. The room is silent.


EXT. SCHOOL FRONT ENTRANCE - NEXT (2:15 P.M.)

Gretchen walks out the front door. Donnie comes chasing after her.

               DONNIE
     Gretchen! Gretchen... wait up!

She turns and faces him, tears in her eyes.

               DONNIE (cont'd)
     I'm so sorry.

They embrace... kissing for the first time.


EXT. BYRD THEATRE - MAGIC HOUR (5:30 P.M.)

The old-fashioned theatre marquee reads:

       HALLOWEEN FRIGHTMARE
        THE EVIL DEAD / THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST

Donnie and Gretchen approach the box office.

               DONNIE
     Two for "Evil Dead", please.


INT. BYRD THEATRE - NEXT

Donnie and Gretchen sit in the middle of the huge, empty theatre.

"The Evil Dead" unfolds. They eat popcorn and watch silently.
Donnie looks over and sees that Gretchen is asleep.

Donnie turns back to the movie... beginning to look ill.

               FRANK
     Feeling sick?

Donnie turns his head over and looks across Gretchen. Frank is
sitting next to her.

               FRANK (cont'd)
     I want to show you something.

               DONNIE
     You have to do something for me first.

               FRANK
     You have a request?

               DONNIE
     Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that
     stupid bunny suit.

               FRANK
     Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?

               DONNIE
     Take it off. I want to see you.

After a moment, Frank slowly reaches up and removes the rabbit
headpiece.

Donnie's eyes widen.

Underneath the headpiece is the human face of a handsome young
man. His left eye does not exist, because it has imploded into the
socket. There is blood oozing from the wound.

               FRANK
     Satisfied?

Donnie just stares at him.

               DONNIE
     What happened to your eye?

               FRANK
     I am so sorry.

               DONNIE
     Why do they call you Frank?

               FRANK
     It is the name of my father... and his
     father before me.

               DONNIE
     How much longer is this gonna last?

               FRANK
     You should already know that.
          (beat)
     Watch the movie, Donnie. I have something
     to show you.

Donnie looks at the screen.

On the screen, "The Evil Dead" morphs into a Time Portal.

               FRANK (cont'd)
     There's a storm coming.
          (beat)
     Have you ever seen a Portal, Donnie?

Suddenly... the screen morphs into an image of a large Tudor
house.

               FRANK (cont'd)
     Burn it to the ground.

Donnie pulls out Jim Cunningham's wallet from his pocket.

Donnie contemplates his fate for several more moments, and then
gets up and walks out.


EXT. BYRD THEATRE - NIGHT (6:30 P.M.)

Donnie walks slowly past the theatre marquee.


INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT (7 P.M.)

On the stage, among blowing autumn leaves, Cherita Chen performs a
strangely beautiful mime act to Symphony No. 3 by Henryk Gorecki.

When her act is finally over, the crowd is indifferent, with
scattered applause and laughter. Ms. Pomeroy stands up and
applauds enthusiastically.

Clearly affected by the laughter, Cherita walks offstage.

In the front row, the entire Darko family has assembled.


INT. AUDITORIUM BACKSTAGE - NIGHT (7:15 P.M.)

Kitty Farmer stands with the five-member dance team in a huddle.

               MS. FARMER
     Now girls... I want you to concentrate.
     Failure is not an option. And Bethany...
     if you feel the need to vomit up there.
     Just swallow it.

               BETH
     OK, Mom.

Jim Cunningham walks past them towards the stage. He stops and
touches Samantha on the shoulder... smiling.

               JIM CUNNINGHAM
     Good luck out there.

She smiles nervously back at him. He exits onto the stage.


INT. AUDITORIUM STAGE - NEXT (7:20 P.M.)

               JIM CUNNINGHAM
     Thank you... Cherita Chen. That was
     Autumn Angel.
          (clearing throat)
     Next... it is my distinct pleasure to
     introduce to you... Emily Bates... Suzy
     Bailey... Samantha Darko... Beth Farmer
     ...and Joanie James. They are...
     SPARKLE MOTION!

The audience roars with applause as the lights dim.

The following montage alternates between the auditorium stage and
Jim Cunningham's house.

The stage lights slowly raise as the opening beat of 'West End
Girls' by the Pet Shop Boys begins.

Under the soft stage lights... Sparkle Motion unfolds.

Donnie approaches Jim Cunningham's house.

Sparkle Motion... in perfect synchronicity.

In the living room of the house... Donnie walks through, dousing
gasoline all over the place with psychotic force. A trail of fire
spreads.

A mystery woman emerges from the back wall of the auditorium.

A couch and curtains become engulfed in flames.

Middlesex girls are jumping up and down in the aisles.

Eddie and Rose are smiling ear to ear.

Elizabeth Darko is cracking up at the entire scene.

Kids are going bonkers in the aisles.

The mystery woman takes off her glasses.

Slow motion: fire engulfs a deer taxidermy.

Ms. Pomeroy gets into the groove.

The parents are now on their feet.

The crowd roars even louder.

Slow motion: Sparkle Motion stands triumphant.

Slow motion: Donnie stands before a wall of flames.


EXT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - NIGHT (8 P.M.)

Cherita sits alone in the courtyard at the base of the mongrel
statue... defeated and alone.


INT. BYRD THEATRE - NIGHT (9 P.M.)

Donnie walks into the theatre and sits next to Gretchen, who is
asleep. As the credits to the film roll, Donnie wakes her.

               GRETCHEN
          (disoriented)
     What? How long was I asleep?

               DONNIE
     The whole movie. Let's go.


INT. JIM CUNNINGHAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT (9:45 P.M.)

Firemen walk through the charred room shining flashlight.

A Fireman shines his flashlight onto a mysterious door with smoke
emerging from it.

He kicks the door in... and shines the flashlight into the dark
hole.


EXT. CARPATHIAN RIDGE - SUNRISE (5 A.M.)

Donnie and Gretchen lie awake on a pile of blankets... staring out
into the abyssal canyon.

Helicopter shot: we swoop down over Carpathian Ridge... past
Donnie and Gretchen... over the canyon and the endless expanse of
evergreen forest.

Title card:

               OCTOBER 22 1988


EXT. DARKO HOUSE BACKYARD / PATIO - MORNING (11 A.M.)

Donnie and Eddie are in the backyard raking leaves onto a giant
sheet.

               DONNIE
     I know everyone thinks I'm a nutcase.
     I've been getting a lot of weird looks
     from people lately.

They rake in silence for a moment.

               EDDIE
          (angry)
     Who's been giving you weird looks?

               DONNIE
     A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids.
     It's like they're afraid of me for some
     reason.
          (beat)
     But that's OK... because I know I deserve
     it.

Eddie stops raking.

               EDDIE
     You're my only son...

               DONNIE
     I know, Dad.

               EDDIE
     I know I'm not the best... communicator.
          (beat)
     But whatever happens in your life...
     whatever obstacles you come up against...
     you just say... and do whatever is in your
     heart. You be honest... and tell the
     truth... even if they look at you funny...
     and they will. They'll tell you that
     you're wrong. They'll call you a fool.
          (beat)
     But what you've got to understand, son,
     is that almost all of those people are
     full of bullshit... and they're scared of
     people like you. Because you're smarter
     than all of them.

Donnie smiles at his father.


INT. DONNIE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON (1 P.M.)

Donnie sits on his bed and stares at the calendar on his wall.
Each day is marked with an X.

He takes his pills from his nightstand... and downs three.

There are noises coming from downstairs.


INT. FAMILY ROOM - AFTERNOON

Donnie comes downstairs to see Elizabeth glued to the TV.

               ELIZABETH
     Oh my God, that's him. That's the guy
     from last night.

On the television: a Newscaster stands in front of the charred
heap of what was once a large suburban house. Firefighters mill
about behind her.

               NEWSCASTER
      As firefighters continue their
      investigation, arson has not been ruled
      out as a cause of the fire, particularly
      because of the shocking discovery made
      earlier today among the burned ruins. In
      the basement of the house, authorities
      have discovered what has been described
      as a kiddie-porn dungeon.

Policemen emerge from the basement with several large boxes of
evidence.

               NEWSCASTER (cont'd)
     Cunningham, who has become a recent
     celebrity for his motivational books,
     audio tapes and videos, ducked his head
     from cameras when he was arrested at the
     Sarasota Heights Golf Club this morning.
     In a vicious statement, Cunning Visions
     executive Linda Connie attacked the
     Middlesex Fire Department... claiming a
     vast conspiracy.

Donnie stares at the television... speechless, horrified. On the
TV, Jim Cunningham hides his face from the camera.

               ELIZABETH
     Oh my God. Dad played golf with that guy.

Donnie says nothing, turns around... and walks upstairs.


INT. PHYSICS CLASS - DAY (2 P.M.)

Donnie and Dr. Monnitoff are having another in-depth
conversation.

               DR. MONNITOFF
     Each vessel travels along a vector path
     through space-time... along its centre of
     gravity.

               DONNIE
          (to himself)
     Like a spear.

               DR. MONNITOFF
     Beg pardon?

               DONNIE
     Like a spear that comes out of your
     stomach?

               DR. MONNITOFF
     Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel
     to travel through time it must find the
     portal, in this case the wormhole, or
     some unforeseen portal that lies
     undiscovered.

               DONNIE
     Could these wormholes appear in nature?

               DR. MONNITOFF
     That... is highly unlikely. You're talking
     about an act of God.

               DONNIE
     If God controls time... then all time is
     pre-decided. Then every living thing
     travels along a set path.

               DR. MONNITOFF
     I'm not following you.

               DONNIE
     If you could see your path or channel
     growing out of your stomach, you could see
     into the future. And that's a form of
     time travel, right?

               DR. MONNITOFF
     You are contradicting yourself, Donnie. If
     we could see our destines manifest
     themselves visually... then we would be
     given the choice to betray our chosen
     destinies. The very fact that this choice
exists... would mean that all pre-formed
     destiny would end.

               DONNIE
     Not if you chose to stay within God's
     channel...

               DR. MONNITOFF
          (cutting him off)
     Donnie, I'm afraid I can't continue this
     conversation. I could lose my job.


INT. TEACHER'S LOUNGE - AFTERNOON (2:30 P.M.)

Ms. Pomeroy sits across from Dr. Monnitoff. They both grade
papers silently.

Dr. Monnitoff stares at her for a long moment.

               DR. MONNITOFF
          (incredulous)
     Donnie... Darko.

She stares at him for a while, haunted by something.


INT. PRINCIPAL COLE'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON (3 P.M.)

Ms. Pomeroy sits across from Principal Cole.

               PRINCIPAL COLE
     I'm sorry, Karen, this is a specialised
     school. We don't think the methods
     you've undertaken here are appropriate.

               MS. POMEROY
     "Appropriate".
          (trying to contain her anger)
     With all due respect, sir, what
     specifically about my methods do you find
     inappropriate?

Principal Cole stares at her for a moment.

               PRINCIPAL COLE
     I don't have to get myself into a
     debate about this, Karen, I believe I
     have made myself clear.

               MS. POMEROY
     You call this... clarity? I don't think
     you have a clue what it's really like to
     communicate with these kids. You don't
     think that they can smell your bullshit
     from a mile away? Every day that goes by
     ...that we fail to... inspire them... is
     another moment that we all lose. And we
     are losing them to apathy, and this...
     prescribed nonsense. They are slipping
     away...

               PRINCIPAL COLE
     I am sorry that you have failed. Now if
     you'll excuse me, I have another
     appointment. You can finish out the week.


INT. SCHOOL OFFICE / TEACHER'S LOUNGE - NEXT (3:15 P.M.)

Ms. Pomeroy steps out from Principal Cole's office. She sees
Kitty Farmer and the Sparkle Motion girls milling about. The
mystery woman is there as well.

Ms. Pomeroy glares at Kitty Farmer before leaving.


EXT. MIDDLESEX RIDGE SCHOOL - NEXT (3:30 P.M.)

Ms. Pomeroy steps outside through an emergency exit. She stares
out at the beautiful forest. Her eyes are filled with tears.

               MS. POMEROY
     FUUUUUUUCKKKKKK!!!!!

Hearing the scream from the distance, we see Cherita Chen turn
her head in shock as she walks alone along the edge of the
school building, eating her lunch.

She and Ms. Pomeroy share a moment of eye contact before she turns
and heads back into the school.


INT. MAIN SCHOOL HALLWAY - NEXT (3:45 P.M.)

Ms. Pomeroy walks slowly through the hallway, wiping tears from
her face.

               PRINCIPAL COLE
          (over the intercom)
     Good afternoon. It is my great pleasure to
     announce that the Middlesex Middle School
     dance team has been invited to perform on
     Ed McMahon's Star Search '88 in Los
     Angeles, California...


INT. PRINCIPAL COLE'S OFFIC - NEXT (3:45 P.M.)

The Sparkle Motion girls squeal with excitement... jumping up
and down. Kitty Farmer pumps her fist in victory.

Suddenly... Linda Connie bursts into the office, grabbing Kitty
by the arm. The teacher holds up a newspaper... where there is a
headline that reads: JIM CUNNINGHAM CHARGED.

Kitty's facial expression goes from elation to horror.


INT. ENGLISH CLASS - MORNING (8:30 P.M.)

The classroom is dark. The students watch "Watership Down", the
movie.

Donnie is asleep. Gretchen stares at him. Ms. Pomeroy stares at
Gretchen.

Suddenly, she turns on the lights, turning off the TV.

Donnie wakes up... with dark circles under his eyes.

               MS. POMEROY
     And when the other rabbits hear of
     Fiver's vision, do they believe him?
       (cough)
     It could be the death of an entire way of
     life, the end of an era.

               DONNIE
     Why should we care?

               MS. POMEROY
     Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.

               DONNIE
     Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it
     was a human?

               MS. POMEROY
     Is the death of one species less tragic
     than another?

               DONNIE
     Of course. A rabbit is not like us. It
     has no history books... it has no
     knowledge of sorrow or regret. I like
     bunnies and all. They're cute... and
     they're horny. And if you're cute and
     horny... then you're probably happy that
     you don't know who you are... or why
     you're even alive. But the only thing I've
     known rabbits to do is have sex as many
     times as possible before they die.

He looks over at Gretchen, who looks angry at this.

               DONNIE (cont'd)
     There's no point in crying for a dead
     rabbit... who never feared death to begin
     with.

The class is silent for a moment.

               GRETCHEN
     You're wrong.
          (beat)
     You're wrong about these rabbits. These
     rabbits can talk. They are the product of
     the authors imagination. And he cares for
     them. So we care for them too. We care
     that their home has been destroyed... and
     that their lives are in danger. Otherwise
     ...we've missed the point.

               MS. POMEROY
     But aren't we forgetting the miracle of
     storytelling? The dea ex machina. The god
     machine. That is how the rabbits are
     saved.

Gretchen looks across the room at Donnie with a disdainful
expression.


INT. MAIN SCHOOL HALLWAY - LATER (9 A.M.)

Donnie approaches Gretchen at her locker.

               DONNIE
     You want to skip fourth period and go to
     the Ridge?

               GRETCHEN
          (angry)
     What's wrong with you?

               DONNIE
     What do you mean?

She turns and walks off, leaving Donnie broken and dejected.


INT. DONNIE'S ROOM - NIGHT (6:30 P.M.)

Donnie sits at his desk looking at an intricate drawing of a cloud
formation. On it he has written: THE PORTAL.


INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT (7 P.M.)

Rose and Eddie are in the kitchen. He is getting ready for a
business trip.

Samantha is jumping up and down. Elizabeth is jumping up and
down, dancing with her.

Donnie looks into the kitchen from the foyer, catching his family
in a serene, contented moment of happiness. A moment that he
chooses not to interrupt.

INT. / EXT. FOYER / FRONT PORCH - DAY (3 P.M.)

Doorbell rings. Rose answers the door.

Kitty Farmer is there on the front porch. She is wearing a T-shirt
that reads: GOD IS AWESOME!

               MS. FARMER
     Rose.

               ROSE
     Kitty...

               MS. FARMER
     Rose, we have a crisis.
          (beat)
     I am sure that you are aware of the
     horrible allegations against Jim
     Cunningham.

               ROSE
     Yes, I saw the news. Something about a
     kiddie-porn dungeon.

               MS. FARMER
          (holding up her hand)
     Please! Don't say those words.
          (shaking her head)
     Well... as you can see... many of us are
     devastated by this news. This is
     obviously some kind of conspiracy meant
     to destroy an innocent man. And I have
     taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim
     Cunningham defence campaign. But
     unfortunately my civic duties have
     created a conflict of interest... which
     involves you.

               ROSE
     Beg pardon?

               MS. FARMER
     Rose... I have to appear at his
     arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you
     know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles
     tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach...
     I was the obvious choice to chaperone
     them on the trip.

               ROSE
     But now you can't go.

               MS. FARMER
     Yes. And believe me, of all the other
     mothers I would never dream of asking
     you, given the predicament with your son.
     But none of the other mothers are able
     to go.

               ROSE
     Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-
     minute... Eddie is in New York...

               MS. FARMER
     Rose... I don't know if you realise how
     great an opportunity this is for our
     daughters. This has been a dream of ours
     for a long time.
          (beat)
     Sometimes I doubt your commitment to
     Sparkle Motion.


INT. DONNIE'S ROOM - NIGHT (7 P.M.)

Rose is standing in Donnie's room alone. She stares at a
drawing of Frank that he has tacked onto his bulletin board.

Donnie appears in the doorway. Rose jumps.

               DONNIE
     I feel like... I'm approaching something
     horrible.

Donnie walks over and sits on his bed. Rose goes and sits next
to him.

               ROSE
     I have to take the girls to Los Angeles
     tomorrow.

               DONNIE
     Do you get to meet Ed?

               ROSE
     If I'm lucky.
          (beat)
     So... I won't be back until the first.
     Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've
     put Elizabeth in charge until then. She
     has the car... so she can drive you to
     your therapy tomorrow.

               DONNIE
     How does it feel to have a wacko for
     a son?

               ROSE
          (embracing him)
     It feels wonderful.


EXT. DARKO HOUSE DRIVEWAY - MORNING (10 A.M.)

Rose brings her luggage out to the airport van. Mystery Woman
loads Beth Farmer into the van.

Donnie sits on the back-porch steps, watching everyone silently.
Elizabeth gives Samantha a hug.

               ELIZABETH
     You're gonna win. I know it.

               SAMANTHA
     So do I.
          (to Donnie)
     Bye, Donnie.

Donnie waves goodbye.

               ROSE
     Here are the keys to the Taurus. There's
     plenty of groceries in the fridge. And
     I left money on the kitchen table. And
     don't forget...

               ELIZABETH
     Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll miss
     your flight.

Rose turns... wanting to say goodbye to Donnie, but not knowing
how. She smiles and waves goodbye.

Donnie waves back.

Rose turns and goes to the van... handing the driver her last bag.

               DONNIE
     Mom...

Donnie stands up and reluctantly approaches from the porch.

               DONNIE (cont'd)
     There's nothing broken... in my brain.

Rose stands there for a moment, looking at her only son.

               SAMANTHA
     Come on, Mom!

               ROSE
          (to Donnie, holding back tears)
     I know.

She gets into the van, as Donnie and Elizabeth watch them drive
off.


INT. SCHOOL MAIN HALLWAY - AFTERNOON (3 P.M.)

Donnie walks up to Gretchen, who stands at her locker with several
other girls. The girls whisper to each other as he approaches.

               DONNIE
     Will you please talk to me?

               GRETCHEN
     Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.

               DONNIE
     Then when? I have to talk to you.

Gretchen walks away, looking back at him with apologetic eyes.


INT. ENGLISH CLASS - MOMENTS LATER (3:15 P.M.)

Donnie walks alone through the hallways... lost.

He stumbles upon Ms. Pomeroy's room. She sits behind her desk...
which has been packed up into a cardboard box.

               DONNIE
          (knocking on the door)
     Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?

               MS. POMEROY
     Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be
     off with your friends, scaring old people?

               DONNIE
     Where are you going?

               MS. POMEROY
     I don't know. That's a good question...
     but suffice to say that I am no longer
     your English teacher. They fired me.

               DONNIE
     That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.

               MS. POMEROY
     Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good
     student. Lazy... but a good student.
     Unlike most of the others, you question
     Mom and Dad's rules.

               DONNIE
     What do I tell the rest of the class when
     they ask about you?

               MS. POMEROY
          (long beat)
     Tell them that everything is going to be
     just fine.
          (beat)
     It is up to the children to save
     themselves these days. Because the parents
     ...they don't have a clue.

Donnie looks at the blackboard. On it she has written in perfect
penmanship: "Cellar Door".

               DONNIE
     What's "Cellar Door"?

               MS. POMEROY
          (spaced out)
     A famous linguist once said... that of all
     the phrases in the English language, of
     all the endless combinations of words in
     all of history... that "Cellar Door" is
     the most beautiful.

She is silent for a moment.

               DONNIE
     Cellar door.

               MS. POMEROY
     Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps
     us going.

She takes the box and crosses the room towards Donnie.

               MS. POMEROY (cont'd)
      So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?

               DONNIE
     I think I already have.
          (beat)
     But now she won't even talk to me.

               MS. POMEROY
     Then go find her, Donnie. Don't let her
     get away.
          (stopping at the door)
     She was right about the rabbits. Go.


INT. MAIN HALLWAY - NEXT (3:15. P.M.)

And with that... Ms. Pomeroy turns and walks down the hallway with
her career in a cardboard box... heading towards the bright Friday
afternoon sunlight.

Donnie walks back down the hallway... lost in his own
introspection.

Across the way... at her locker... as Cherita Chen. Donnie
approaches her slowly like a cat.

She turns from her locker... and they make eye contact.

She looks at him warily, frightened. A book falls from her arms
onto the floor.

Written in large letters on the brown book cover is his name.

               DONNIE DARKO.

He comes face to face with her, grabs her earmuffs with both
hands, and touches his forehead to hers as if he were going to
kiss her.

               DONNIE
          (long beat)
     I promise that one day things will get
     better for you.

Cherita holds still for a moment, trembling, and then jerks back
from him. Her earmuffs come off in his hands.

She backs away from him slowly. A single tear rolls down her cheek.

               CHERITA
     Chut... up!

She then turns and runs down the hall... disappearing from sight.


EXT. OLD GUN ROAD - AFTERNOON (4 P.M.)

Donnie walks by himself... thinking... wearing Cherita's earmuffs.

INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY (1:30 P.M.)

Donnie is under hypnosis

               DR. THURMAN
     And when I clap my hands together twice,
     you will wake up. Do you understand?

               DONNIE
     Yes.

               DR. THURMAN
     So, your parents... why did you disappoint
     them?

               DONNIE
     I... I was playing with fire.

               DR. THURMAN
     Is it Frank who wants you to destroy the
     world, to set the world on fire?

Donnie doesn't answer.

               DONNIE
     People get hurt.

               DR. THURMAN
     But it was an accident. The house was
     under construction.

               DONNIE
     People get hurt. I don't want to hurt
     anyone.

               DR. THURMAN
     But you were punished.

               DONNIE
     Yes. I went to jail.

               DR. THURMAN
     Do you wish that you were punished by your
     parents instead?

               DONNIE
     They... didn't buy me what I wanted for
     Christmas that year.

               DR. THURMAN
     What did you want for Christmas that year?

               DONNIE
     Hungry Hungry Hippos.

               DR. THURMAN
     How did you feel... being denied those
     Hungry Hungry Hippos?

               DONNIE
     Regret.

               DR. THURMAN
     What else makes you feel regret?

               DONNIE
     That I did it again.

               DR. THURMAN
          (alarmed)
     You've done it again?

               DONNIE
     Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned
     down that pervert's house. I think I only
     have a few days left... before they catch
     me.

               DR. THURMAN
     Why did you do these things, Donnie? Did
     Frank tell you to commit these crimes?

He does not respond.

               DONNIE
     I have to obey him... because he saved my
     life. He controls me and I have to obey
     him or I'll be left all alone... and I'll
     never figure out what all of this means...

               DR. THURMAN
     If God exists?

               DONNIE
     I think now that he might...

               DR. THURMAN
     Why?

               DONNIE
     Because I'm so horny.

               DR. THURMAN
     God exists because you're horny.

               DONNIE
     I think so. I think that's one of the
     clues. It's a clue that tells us... to
     keep going.

               DR. THURMAN
     Where are we going?

No answer.

               DR. THURMAN (cont'd)
     Where are we going, Donald?

               DONNIE
     I have the power to build a time machine.

               DR. THURMAN
     How is that possible?

               DONNIE
     Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.

               DR. THURMAN
     Then how is time travel possible?

               DONNIE
     It would have to be God's portal. They
     will lead me to it. Then I will go back in
     time... and I won't feel regret anymore.

               DR. THURMAN
     When will this happen?

               DONNIE
     Soon. Time is almost up.

Donnie gets up on his feet, staggering around the room. He looks
frightened... childlike.

               DONNIE (cont'd)
     It has to happen soon, it has to happen
     soon.

Dr. Thurman gets up and tries to control Donnie... following him
around the room.

               DR. THURMAN
     What is going to happen?

               DONNIE
          (freaking out)
     Frank is going to kill.

               DR. THURMAN
     Who is he going to kill?

Dr. Thurman grabs him, trying to get him under control in an
awkward embrace.

               DR. THURMAN (cont'd)
     Who is he going to kill?

Donnie stares across the office like a frightened child... as the
room becomes white with artificial light.

Frank is there in the office... staring back at him.

               DONNIE
          (freaking out)
     I can see him right now!

               DR. THURMAN
     Where is he, Donald?

               DONNIE
     He's right there... He can read my mind
     and he'll show me the way out of this.
     The sky is going to open up... and then
     He will reveal himself to me.

               DR. THURMAN
     If the sky were to suddenly open up...
     there would be no law... there would be
     no rule. There would only be you and
     your memories... the choices you've made
     and the people you've touched. The life
     that has been carved out from your
     subconscious is the only evidence by
     which you will be judged... by which you
     must judge yourself. Because when this
     world ends, there will only be you and
     him... and no one else.

               DONNIE
     It's too late. I've already ruined my
     life.

               DR. THURMAN
     You will survive this... Donald. I
     promise you that you will survive. You
     must let me help you.
          (beat)
     And when I clap my hands together, you
     will wake up.

She claps her hands together twice... and Donnie snaps out of
his trance.


INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON (2 P.M.)

Donnie, calmed down and putting his jacket on, walks slowly to the
doorway.

Dr. Thurman stands looking out the window.

               DR. THURMAN
     Donald?

Donnie turns back and faces her. Beat.

               DR. THURMAN (cont'd)
     Your medication. They're placebos. Just
     pills made out of water.

               DONNIE
     Thank you.

               DR. THURMAN
     Donald, an atheist is someone who denies
     altogether the existence of a God. You are
     an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who
     believes that there can be no proof of the
     existence of God... but does not deny the
     possibility that God exists.

               DONNIE
     Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.

               DR. THURMAN
     Goodbye, Donald.


INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Donnie walks into the kitchen, where Elizabeth is sitting at the
table.

               ELIZABETH
          (in shock)
     I got in. I'm going to Harvard.

               DONNIE
     Congratulations.

Donnie sits down across from her.

               DONNIE (cont'd)
     Mom and Dad won't be back until Sunday
     night. It's Halloween Carnival. We should
     throw a party. We could totally get away
     with it.

               ELIZABETH
          (long beat)
     Okay, but it has to be a small one.

               DONNIE
     Everything is going to be just fine.


EXT. DARKO HOUSE - NIGHT (9 P.M.)

Neighbourhood kids are trick-or-treating. The man in the red
jogging suit shines a flashlight towards the house.

There are at least two dozen cars parked in front... and somebody
is already throwing toilet paper in the trees.


INT. FOYER - NIGHT (9:30 P.M.)

The doorbell rings. Donnie answers the door... only to find Sean
and Ronald dressed in black with monster masks. They are both
carrying backpacks.

Donnie is dressed in a black skeleton suit, and his face is
painted white like a skull.

               SEAN
     We got eggs, water balloons, and a dozen
     rolls of toilet paper.

               RONALD
     I stole four beers from my dad.

               DONNIE
     There's a keg here.

               SEAN
     Only pussies drink keg beer.

They go back into the house towards the kitchen. There are at
least forty people, already quite wasted, many carrying their own
twelve-packs of beer under their arms.

Almost everyone is wearing a costume. Donnie and his friends weave
through the crowd toward the patio.


EXT. BACKYARD / PATIO - NEXT

Donnie and his friends watching the party unfold.

The party grows larger.


INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Dr. Thurman paces around her office with the phone to her ear.


INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

The phone is ringing. The answering machine picks up.


INT. FOYER - LATER ON (11 P.M.)

The doorbell rings... and once again Donnie is the one to answer
it. To his surprise... it is Gretchen standing on his front porch.

               GRETCHEN
          (very upset)
     Hey.

               DONNIE
     Hey. You OK?

               GRETCHEN
          (walking inside)
     My mom is gone.

               DONNIE
     Where is she?

               GRETCHEN
          (close to tears)
     I don't know. She didn't leave a note.
     The house is all messed up.

               DONNIE
     But you're OK?

She nods yes.

               DONNIE (cont'd)
     Did you call the cops?

               GRETCHEN
     Yeah, they told me to get out of the
     house.

Donnie takes Gretchen into the hallway and gives her a hug.

               GRETCHEN (cont'd)
     I'm so scared... I just keep thinking
     that something awful has happened. It's
     my fucking stepdad. I know it.

               DONNIE
          (embraces her)
     It's safe here.

Donnie takes Gretchen upstairs. We reveal Elizabeth watching them
go.


INT. FAMILY ROOM - NEXT

Elizabeth walks over to a friend.

               ELIZABETH
          (yelling over the music)
     Have you seen Frank?

               FRIEND
     No. I think they said they were going on
     a beer run.


INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NEXT (11:15 P.M.)

Donnie and Gretchen sit on the bed. Gretchen takes a sip of beer.

               GRETCHEN
     Some people are just born with tragedy in
     their blood.

He kisses her. He then pulls back.

               GRETCHEN (cont'd)
     What?

               DONNIE
     There's something you have to know,
     Gretchen.
          (beat)
     Everything is going to be just fine.

They lie down together... silently listening to the party below.

The phone is ringing. The answering machine picks up.

               ROSE
          (on the answering machine)
     If you're there, please pick up.
          (beat)
     Oh well... there's good news. The girls...
     they got three and a half stars... and
     they get to come back for the quarter-
     finals.


INT. LAX TERMINAL - NIGHT (9 P.M. PST)

Rose stands at a payphone while the Sparkle Motion girls wait at
the terminal.

               SAMANTHA
     Semi-finals, Mom!

               ROSE
     Sorry... semi-finals. Anyway... we're
     taking the red-eye back tonight and we
     should arrive around six a.m. I hope
     everything is alright. Bye.


INT. FOYER - NIGHT (12 A.M.)

We move towards the grandfather clock and see the minute hand
reach midnight.


INT. FOYER - NIGHT (12:30 A.M.)

Donnie and Gretchen walk downstairs. They kiss, and she goes
towards the family room.

Donnie walks towards the kitchen, but then doubles over against
the wall in pain.

Suddenly... the room blows out with a strobe of white light... as
costumed teenagers and their vector spears intersect in a
shimmering maze of chaos.

Donnie slowly follows his spear as it leads him through the
crowd... directly towards the refrigerator.

Donnie stares blankly at what he sees... scrawled in magic marker
on the memo board.

It reads: FRANK WAS HERE... WENT TO GET BEER!!

Donnie stares at the board for several moment... he then turns
his head and sees a teenager with a Ronald Reagan mask walk by.
He then sees another spear come towards him. Gretchen rounds
the corner, coming in from the family room.

Donnie falls to his knees and puts his face inside the end of
Gretchen's spear. We see his P.O.V. - an abyssal tunnel of light.

               DONNIE
     Come with me.

               GRETCHEN
     Where are we going?

He grabs her and pulls her out the back of the kitchen into the
back yard. Ronald and Sean follow.


EXT. BACKYARD / PATIO - NEXT

They move through the backyard.

               GRETCHEN
     Donnie, what's going on!

She stops him.

               DONNIE
     Time is running out. We have to go see
     Grandma Death. We have to talk to her.

               GRETCHEN
     Why? Is this about the book?

               DONNIE
     No. Frank.

               GRETCHEN
     Who's Frank?

Ronald and Sean approach.

               SEAN
     Donnie? Where are we going?

Donnie looks at Gretchen... This is it.

               DONNIE
     She knows. I know she knows.


EXT. NEIGHBOURHOOD STREET - NIGHT (1:15 A.M.)

The group of hour ride their bikes down the street.


EXT. FOREST - NIGHT (1:45 A.M.)

They ride their bikes through the forest.


EXT. GRANDMA DEATH'S HOUSE - NIGHT (1:30 A.M.)

They stand in front of the dark house. It is pitch-black. No
lights anywhere.

               SEAN
     There's nobody here... Just forget it.

Then... there is a clanking noise from somewhere around the side
of the house. Everyone hears it.

Donnie looks towards the lower front of the house where there is a
cellar door.

               GRETCHEN
     Is that a cellar door?

               DONNIE
          (his eyes widen)
     Yeah...

The cellar door is ajar... and there is a dim light coming out
from inside.

               RONALD
     Don't open it, Donnie. Let's just leave.


INT. GRANDMA DEATH'S CELLAR - NEXT

Donnie and Gretchen open the door to the cellar... and descend
down into a murky pit with a stone floor.

Inside... the room is quite large... filled with row after row of
boxes, paintings, antique furniture and chandeliers. There is even
an ancient piano in the back.

Gretchen slowly reaches her hand out and places her finger on the
deepest piano key.

Suddenly a figure emerges from the shadows and slams Donnie into
the wall. He then grabs Gretchen by placing an arm around her neck
with a butcher's knife.

It is Ricky Danforth. Seth comes out from another corner... also
brandishing a butcher's knife. Both have pantyhose pulled over
their heads.

               RICKY
     Get the fuck out! Now!

Ricky drags Gretchen out. Seth drags Donnie out.


EXT. GRANDMA DEATH'S HOUSE - NEXT

The four of them come bursting out of the cellar.

Seth holds Donnie's arms down with his knees and places the
butcher's knife against his throat.

Ricky throws Gretchen down hard onto the shoulder of Old Gun Road.
She lets out a gasp of pain as her head hits the gravel.

               RICKY
     Motherfuckers!

               SETH
     I have... a bigger knife now.

Sean and Ronald watch... dumbfounded, backing away.

Seth just stares down at Donnie with his dead eyes... pushing the
knife down harder, cutting off Donnie's air supply.

               SEAN
     Hey... there's someone coming! Look,
     there's a car coming!

Seth slowly turns his head and sees... far down Old Gun Road...
approaching headlights.

               DONNIE
          (barely audible whisper)
      Dea ex machina...

               SETH
      What did you say?

               DONNIE
      Our saviour...

The headlights are getting close.

               RICKY
      They called the fuckin' cops!

Gretchen struggles to breathe on the shoulder of the road... the
wind knocked out of her, semi-conscious.

               SETH
      That's no cop...

The headlights are getting close.

               GRETCHEN
          (in a hoarse whisper)
      Donnie...

Even closer...

               DONNIE
      You better run.

               RICKY
      Forget it... let's go!

Seth doesn't move... He just stares down at Donnie.

               RICKY (cont'd)
      Come on! Let's go!

               SETH
      You're dead, Donnie Darko.

Seth gets up and runs off with Ricky into the forest... just as
the approaching car crests the top of Old Gun Road at breakneck
speed.

Suddenly, in the bright glow of the car's headlights... is the
silhouette of Grandma Death... standing in the middle of the road.
In her right hand she is clutching a letter.

Donnie's letter.

               GRETCHEN
     Donnie...

The car swerves left, barely missing Grandma Death.

The Pontiac tries to brake hard... but the wheels lock... and it
goes skidding onto the shoulder.

Gretchen raises her head from the gravel... into bright headlight
beams.

The Trans-Am goes barrelling over her like a speed-bump... and
her limp body rolls off into the grassy ditch.

The Trans-Am skids off into the grass and collides head-on with
the crumbling stone chimney... which explodes into the crumpled
hood of the car... as it eventually comes to a stop in a fury of
smoke.

Donnie staggers to his feet... regaining his breath. He runs over
to Gretchen and kneels down next to her.

               DONNIE
     Gretchen... wake up. Wake up.

Her neck is broken. She has no pulse.

The passenger door to the Trans-Am opens, and a passenger in a
clown costume gets out.

The driver's side door opens and the driver gets out.

He is wearing a rabbit suit. A Halloween costume.

He is holding the grotesque rabbit helmet in his hand.

It is Frank.

               PASSENGER
     Frank... what'd you do... what'd you do!

Frank approaches Donnie... who raises his head from Gretchen to
see him for the first time... face to face... with an expression
of shocked horror.

               PASSENGER (cont'd)
     She's dead. You killed her, Frank!

Frank is in shock.

               FRANK
     She's dead.

Donnie slowly nods his head. Sean and Ronald approach him slowly.
Grandma Death looms behind them.

               FRANK
     What the fuck. Look at my fucking car!

               PASSENGER
     Let's get out of here. Let's get out of
     here, Frank!

               FRANK
     What were you stupid fucks doing in the
     middle of the road?

               DONNIE
     Waiting for you.

Donnie raises the gun from his father's closet with his right
hand, and to his own surprise, he pulls the trigger.

Frank's left eye implodes as the bullet passes through his
head. His body falls limply to the ground.

               PASSENGER
     Holy shit...

The Passenger turns and runs off into the woods.

               RONALD
     What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do!

               DONNIE
          (very calm)
     Go home. Go home and tell your parents
     that everything is going to be just fine.

After contemplation of the recent events... Sean and Ronald turn
and run off in the opposite direction.

Donnie is left alone... with the dead bodies.

He turns and stares at Grandma Death... who is calmly standing
there... with his letter in her hand.

               GRANDMA DEATH
     A storm is coming.
          (beat)
     You must hurry.

Donnie is still in shock.

INT. DONNIE'S ROOM - NEXT

The mammoth jet engine has plummeted all the way down through
the house, creating a cavernous hole that splits Donnie's room
in half. The smoke from the wreckage begins to clear.

Above the engine is Donnie... impaled through the stomach by
a wooden beam that was once part of the floor beneath his bed.
There is blood gushing from his mouth, as his face is contorted
into an expression that could almost be a smile.


EXT. NEIGHBOURHOOD STREET - MORNING (11 A.M.)

The same disaster scene as before... only more media, more
neighbours, and a Coroner. People stand around in shock...
disbelief.

From the other end of the street, a girl comes riding along on a
bike... slowly taking in the entire scene. She pulls up to the
kerb where a kid named David (eleven) is standing around.

It is Gretchen Ross.

               GRETCHEN
     Hi... what's going on here?

               DAVID
     Horrible accident. My neighbour... he
     got killed.

               GRETCHEN
     What happened?

               DAVID
     He got smooshed. By a jet engine.

She stares at the house, where paramedics wheel a body out of
the front door.

               GRETCHEN
     What was his name?

               DAVID
     Donnie. Donnie Darko.

They stare at the front yard for a while. We see Elizabeth. We
see Eddie, carrying Samantha... who is crying.

               DAVID
     I feel bad for his family.

               GRETCHEN
          (long beat)
     Yeah.

               DAVID
     Did you know him?

She stares at the family for several moments... and then shakes
her head slowly as if trying to locate a memory that is slipping
away.

               GRETCHEN
     No.

Rose, leaning against a tree while smoking a cigarette, notices
them. She seems to recognise Gretchen... from somewhere in the
vast reservoir of her memory.

She waves at her.

She waves back.

Fade out.

               THE END
