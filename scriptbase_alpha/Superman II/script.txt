1     INT. OUTSIDE THE COUNCIL OF ELDERS CHAMBER - KRYPTON NIGHT

     All is still. A KRYPTONIAN GUARD stands at sentry beside massive crystalline portals.
Suddenly, silently, NON appears behind him and slips a massive arm across his throat. He 
squeezes, cutting off the guard's breath: the guard crumples silently, and drops to the floor.

     Now GENERAL ZOD and URSA step INTO FRAME.  As ZOD nods his approval to Non, 
Ursa holds the chamber door open for the General to enter.

2     INT. COUNCIL OF ELDERS CHAMBER KRYPTON - NIGHT

ZOD leads the     way into the chamber. This imposing crystalline space, the parliament of 
Krypton, is empty for the moment. But the signs of its members are ever-present: around the great floating slab that is their conference table each has his (or her) own console of crystals - a transparent container marked with the identifying insignia, c.f. the symbols on each of their robes in Part I.

     As Non and Ursa follow two paces behind. Zod strides along the slab, ignoring console after      console, stopping only when he reaches the one emblazoned with the S-like crest of Jor-El.

     ANGLE DOWN ON IT as Zod lifts the lid of the console and removes, from among all 
     transparent crystals, the one red crystal.

     PAN UP as he lifts it high. It glows even in the dim light of the empty chamber - until Zod,
with a satisfied and sinister smile, snaps it in half. He tosses it to the ground and looks with a 
self-congratulatory air at Ursa and Non.

EFECTS: The luminous Spinning Rings (c.f. Part I) descend and encircle the villainous trio, 
imprisoning them like a magical lasso in perpetual motion.

Zod and Ursa are instantly subdued, if sullen; Non stares out at his captors making subhuman      noises of rags and frustrations - literally a caged beast.

3     INT. KRYPTON TRIAL CHAMBER

     A FULL C.U. OF ZOD FILLS THE SCREEN, as:

                         ELDER (V.O.)
                    General Zod. A warped, would-be
                    dictator. His only feeling is contempt.
                    His only desire is to command

                                                  CONTINUED     






3     CONTINUED

C.U. OF URSA FILLS THE SCREEN

                         ELDER (v.o.)
                    Ursa. Her only feeling is for the 
                    vicious General. Her only desire --
                    to rule at his side.

     C.U. OF NON FILLS THE SCREEN

                         ELDER (V.O.)
                    Non. He is without words and 
                    without thought. He is a brute force. 
The General need only command to                          inspire this monster to acts of
mindless destruction.

ON THE THREE - listening implacably.

     ELDER (V.O.)
Together these three are responsible
for the darkest episode in Krypton's
history, the one attempt at insurrection
against our reasoned way of life.

     ESTABLISHING SHOT of the office building on a busy Metropolis street.

30     INT. DAILY PLANET  -  DAY

CLARK KENT comes in, ready to begin a day's work, chipper and friendly. TRACKING WITH HIM as he passes various EMPLOYEES, all of whom seem to be bustling about with exceptional preoccupation. There is an air of tension, often found in newspaper offices when a big story is breaking. At first Clark doesn't realize anything unusual is up.

As a REPORTER with a sheaf of wire service copy in hand bustles by him:

                    CLARK
               Morning, Phil ---

                    PHIL
                  (can't stop to talk)
               'Scuse me Kent.....

Clark is a bit surprised, but continues walking on. A WOMAN REPORTER is heading down the aisle just ahead of him.

                    CLARK
                       (cheerily)
               Hi, Alice. That's a very pretty 
               blouse you -

                    ALICE
                      (preoccupied)

STAY WITH CLARK, now a bit taken aback, as he reaches Perry White's office. Just outside, talking on a phone is JIMMY OLSEN.
 
                         CLARK

Jimmy, how's the -

JIMMY
       (to telephone)
Yeah. I'll check.

     He hangs up and goes to Perry' s office.  Clark follows.

31     INT. PERRY WHITE'S OFFICE

     PERRY WHITE is seated at his desk, looking even more wound-up than usual. 

                         JIMMY
                    Mr. White, the pressroom wants to know how 
much longer to hold the front page.

     PERRY
                                (tense)
                    Give it another ten minutes. If we don't --
                             (changing his mind)
                    Hell, I'll tell him.
                            (he picks up a phone)
                    Pete? If we haven't got anything new in the
next ten minutes just go with the wire service
copy under the 40 pt. banner and run the 
picture for three columns.
     (to Clark)
 Kent,     I need a background story for the page
3 sidebar. Give me every thing you know
about this terrorist group.

     CLARK
         (automatic response)
Right!
          (he turns, starts out briskly, 
then stops, turns and looks at
           Perry with a puzzle expression)
What terrorists group? What's going on?

Get your head out of the clouds, Kent. Where 
you been  the last twelve hours?

     CLARK
Uh...home...

     PERRY
Don't you watch television? Don't you listen
to the radio?

     CLARK
Actually I was trying to catch up on my 
reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got 
around to --

     PERRY
Dickens! The whole world's about to blow
up and you're reading Dickens?!

     JIMMY
      (explaining to the 
        confused Clark)
A gang of terrorists seized the Eiffel Tower
in Paris

     PERRY
He knows where the Eiffel Tower is, Olsen.
        (double checking)
You do, don't you, Kent?

     CLARK
Anybody been hurt?

     JIMMY
So far the hostages are unharmed.

     CLARK
Hostages?

     JIMMY
Tourists, about twenty of 'em.

PERRY
                    But that's penny-ante     stuff. These guys 
are saying that unless the French government
meets their demand they've got a hydrogen  
bomb ready to level Paris.

C.U. CLARK shocked.

                    CLARK
               But . . ..that's terrible!

PERRY
                    That's why they call 'em terrorists.
                             (brusquely)     
                    Go down to the morgue and dig up anything you 
can find on past incidents of --

                         CLARK
       (a sudden thought)
Does Lois know about this yet?

PERRY
                    Does she know about it? She's in it!

                         CLARK
                    What??

                         PERRY
                    The minute the story broke I bundled her on the first 
Concord out of here. If Paris goes kablooey I want the 
best reporter I've got right there in the middle of it.

     FAVORING CLARK-- He looks especially worried now.

                         CLARK
                    Gee. But --

                         PERRY
                    No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best 
we've got.

CLARK
No, I meant, it's awfully dangerous.

     PERRY
That goes with the territory, Kent.

Listen, if I know Lois Lane, she'll not only come
back with a Pulitzer Prize story, she'll have a one 
on one interview with the hydrogen bomb titled 
"What Makes Me Tick. "

ON CLARK -- He stands there, absorbed in his thoughts.

PERRY
                                  (impatiently)     
What are you standing around for, Kent? Come on!
Take off!

behind it.

33     EXT. ALLY  -  DAY

     WIDE     SHOT,      SIDE ANGLE - In this private place, unobserved,  Clark Kent now 
transforms into Superman.

EFFECTS: AT LEFT OF FRAME the Clark Kent image begins to move TO RIGHT, 
leaving images behind as in time-lapse photography, so that by the time he reaches  RIGHT
OF FRAME he has turned completely into Superman. The intervening images show the
various changes in the transformation. 

Now Superman follows Perry White's advice to Clark Kent: he takes off.

ANGLE UP TO SEE HIM fly up the air shaft behind the building and into the sky.

35     EXT.  BASE OF EIFFEL TOWER  - DAY

WIDE ANGLE -- At the base of the tower, a large group of REPORTERS and T.V. CREWS
 are gathered around a SPOKESMAN for the French government. He looks harassed and 
tense. There is very much the atmosphere of a crisis -- CROWDS in b. g. are being held back FRENCH POLICE.

FIRST REPORTER
Can you tell us why they released the first group 
of hostages?

SPOKESMAN
                    We insist they do this to show good faith. If not, 
we refuse to negotiate.

SECOND REPORTER 
            (American accent)
                    And now they are willing to release the rest of the 
hostages?

SPOKESMAN
In return for a guarantee that we will not launch an 
attack an them.

SECOND REPORTER
There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the 
terrorists?

SPOKESMAN
(squirming a bit )
Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.

     SECOND REPORTER
Yes, but will you honor it?

SPOKESMAN
We have not the choice to refuse, have we, if we believe 
it is a real hydrogen bomb that they have.

ANGLE OOWN ON LOIS - as she climbs the lower stairs briskly.

38     EXT. TOP LEVEL, EIFFEL TOWER  - DAY

A drama of our times is being played     out. At     one end of the narrow top level, about EIGHT HOSTAGES are being herded into an elevator by TWO TERRORISTS with machine guns.
The hostages include a couple of NUNS, some CHINESE in buttoned-up gray jackets and a few obvious TOURISTS with cameras.

There are THREE  TERORISTS in all, clad     in gray coveralls to look like workers. The     leader what will remain on the top level, is SERGE. The two who are taking the hostages to     the lower level are LUC and CLAUDE .

                              SERGE
                         Take them down and send them away. But 
watch out for any tricks.

     NUN
         (feisty)
Do we look like the sort who would ---

SERGE
                         It is not what you look like, Sister, it's who you 
are.

     NUN
A higher Power will have to forgive you. . . . 

     SERGE
We'll negotiate with him later. 
        (to his cohorts)
Quickly!

The hostages are herded into the elevators and the doors shut

39     EXT.  EIFFEL TOWER  - DAY

     LONG SHOT-- The upper elevators (lifts) on the Tower, one going up, one going down.

40     ON THE STAIRCASE, BETWEEN THE SECOND LEVEL & THE MID LEVEL -- Lois is      rapidly climbing the circular staircase, running out of breathe.  ANGLE UP.



41     EXT. MID LEVEL PLATFORM  -  DAY

     The hostages emerge from the upper elevator and are transferred into the waiting elevator
which will take them to safety and terra firma. As Luc and Claude prod them in:

                         LUC 
Hurry!

And they do so:

41A     INT. LIFT

     Luc and Claude returning to the top level.

42     Lois climbs under their lift and holds on to a bar underneath.

     ON LOIS - C. U. OF HER HANGING UNDER THE SHAFT, looking down at the dizzying,
 vertigo inducing void below her.

LOIS
              (trying not to panic; keeping
    her goals in front of her)
Pulitzer Prize. Capital P, small u, l, i,     t, z,
 e, r.  Capital P, small r, i -

43     HER POV: The elevator shaft below.  A sight to make strong women weak.

44     ON LOIS -- As she turns away from the sickening sight, she makes a bad move and:

45     Her belt gets caught up in the mechanism under the elevator.

                              LOIS
                         Oh no!

Trying to extricate herself with one hand and hold on with the other, she is definitely in trouble now.

46     LONG SHOT, FROM BELOW --  Of the two elevators moving in the structure. The elevator
with Lois attached to the freed hostages move up, the elevator with the freed hostages moves down.









47     Luc has entered the empty elevator. The oil drum stands in     it.  Attached to it, wired to fuses on the top, is an activating device that functions like a grenade, i.e. once the pin is pulled, the gizmo is activated and the only thing     that keeps it from detonating is the human hand which holds the thing in the safe position. The minute the activator is released, there's only a matter of seconds till     the explosion.

                         SERGE
                    Be careful!

LUC
                    Don't worry, it is me who controls the bomb, 
not the  bomb who --

     SERGE
Yes, yes, all right . . ...

48     SLIGHTLY DOWN to SEE Lois hanging there under the elevator, able to hear all the 
conversation. During PAN:

                    CLAUDE
                      (gallows humor)
               If you let go, I hope you have not many sins to be
               forgiven. Because there will be only ten seconds 
to list them.

     C.U. LOIS - trapped and more fearful than ever.

49     EXT. MID LEVEL  - DAY

THREE FRENCH POLICEMEN, C.R.S. Tactical Squad types, are gathered around the elevator mechanism. The FIRST POLICEMAN talks into a walkie-talkie to contacts elsewhere, while the other two stand ready at the mechanism with impressive-looking cable cutters.

                         FIRST POLICEMAN
                        (to walkie-talkie)
                    Where are they now?







50     ACROSS FROM EIFFEL TOWER  -  DAY

     POV SEEN THROUGH BINOCULARS - SHOWING THE THREE TERRORISTS 
STANDING BY THE ELEVATOR ON THE TOP LEVEL, WITH ONE OF THEM 
(LUC) INSIDE BY THE OIL DRUM.

                    VOICE OVER
                      (Outside Spotter)
               They are near to the elevator, one is 
               inside with the bomb.

51     BALCONY ACROSS FROM THE EIFFEL TOWER - DAY

     ON THE SOURCE OF THE VOICE -- Another FLIC who is standing on this apartment 
house balcony observing the Tower through binoculars and communicating via the walkie
talkie.

                    SPOTTER
               Now the third one has come out . . .. Yes...
all are out.

     VOICE OF POLICEMAN ONE
       (walkie-talkie)
And the bomb? Still in there?

     SPOTTER
Yes,  Get ready.

52     SKY,  PARIS - DAY

LONG SHOT -- Superman flies over the Paris sky towards the Eiffel Tower, which is still a considerable distance away, on the horizon.

53     EXT. SECOND LEVEL, TOWER  -  DAY

     ON THE TWO POLICEMEN with the cable cutters, in place by the thick steel cables that
control the elevators.

                    POLICEMAN ONE
               Now.

The TWO men cut the cables.







IN QUICK CUTS:

54     1.     The taught cable suddenly springs apart and goes slack.

55     2.     The pull on the counter-weight causes the slack cable to zip up the length of 
the Tower like a yo-yo string gone loose. FOLLOW IT UP AND OVER THE TOP.

56      3.      ON THE TOP - Now nothing holds the elevator in place.

57     EXT. TOP LEVEL  -  DAY

     Suddenly the elevator starts to plunge down. The violence of its descent throws LUC, who
was just outside it, onto the ground. As he falls backwards with a scream:

58     INSERT:  His hand holding the firing button lets go as it is yanked from him.

                         LUC
                    It started!

59     EXT. EIFFEL TOWER  -  DAY

LONG SHOT, ANGLE DOWN:  SUPERMAN'S POV of the Tower, now that he is coming close to it, swooping down.

60     INT. ( EXT?)  TOWER SHAFT  -  DAY

     EFFECTS:  The elevator is falling down shaft at terrific speed.

61     C.U. OF terrified Lois under the elevator. She screams.

62     EXT.  SKY - DAY

     Superman, IN C.U., zooms down to Lois as he hears her screams.

63     LONG SHOT - Superman flies inside the Tower.

64     INT. (EXT?)  TOWER SHAFT  -  DAY

     ON A SECOND LEVEL  --  He grabs the elevator bringing it to a sudden, jarring halt. 
While holding it aloft with one mighty hand, he helps the shaken Lois to get off and onto the 
nearby platform.

65     Instantly he springs into the shaft and begins to push the elevator up the Tower at super-speed.

66     QUICK SHOT - ANGLED DOWN ON LOIS as she watches Superman take-off up the shaft.

67     LOIS POV: Superman, pushing the elevator, is now practically to the top of the shaft.

68     EXT.  MODEL

     Superman and lift come crashing out.

69     EXT.  SKY/SPACE

ON SUPERMAN --  He climbs higher over France, gaining speed as the atmosphere begins to blur into the dark mysterious blue of space. 

70     EXT. SPACE

     WIDE SHOT -- Superman, with the speed of light zooms through the Universe, past the
Moon with the Earth growing smaller in the distance. Faster and faster he goes until he bursts through into another galaxy.

71     CLOSE ON SUPERMAN -- as he hurls the lift into the void of outer space.

72     WIDE SHOT - as the nuclear bomb explodes. The closest star breaks into shooting, fiery fragments.

73     ON SUPERMAN - as he is sent reeling through the limitless void, falling away stunned by the explosion.

74     EXT. FURTHER IN SPACE

EFFECTS: Shock waves shake the stability of the furthest galaxies.

75     EXT. SPACE

     ON SUPERMAN - in uncontrolled flight, projected millions of miles, as he regains 
consciousness and steadies his trajectory. He soars through the galaxies, bursting through 
into our Solar System. He wings closer and closer to Earth, growing smaller and smaller as 
he approaches the United States, until he appears as a tiny blue dot far away in a sparkling 
star-filled sky.

76     EXT. DEEP SPACE

     EFFECTS: The shock waves from the nuclear blast are stronger now, ripping through the 
vast dark sky. In the distance, a strange diamond-shape begins to glow.

     PAN  WITH THE SHOCK WAVES, GETTING CLOSER TO THE GLOW: Now we SEE it 
is the crystal two-dimensional prison: The Phantom Zone. The grotesque, pleading heads of GENERAL ZOD, NON and URSA can be seen imprisoned, "flattened" inside.

77     EFFECTS: As the shock waves strike the Phantom Zone, the prison shatters and breaks open.

78     The three great villains burst out into space, taking on their three-dimensional forms again.

They are flung out into the black sky as they suck in the air of unexpected freedom. It is as if      Pandora's Box has been opened.

                    ZOD
               Free!

                    URSA
               Free!

NON lets out a terrifying howl, like an animal who has burst its bonds.

Their horrifying faces fill THE FRAME with yowls of glee as they whirl and drift off      into space, tumbling and flying at great speed. HOLD as they move further and further away, 
moving towards Earth, until they are tiny dots lost in the stars.

They regain their balance and realize they can fly as we SEE our solar system in b.g.

79     EXT.  METROPOLIS STREET, DAILY PLANET  -  DAY

     ON CLARK - as he comes up out of a subway station opposite the Daily Planet Building, 
looking as harassed as any other rush hour rider. Suddenly he brightens.

PAN TO the sight that cheers him. It is Lois, of course, just stepping off a bus across the street on her way to the office.

          CLARK
          Lois! Hey, Lois --

She turns and gives him a friendly wave, but then our busy girl reporter keeps right on going toward the building.

ON CLARK  -- Disappointed, our ever-eager swain hurries to catch up with her. FOLLOW HIM as he steps out into the street just as the light changes.

                    CLARK
                     (not that she's listening)
               Wait up a minute. . .

Suddenly, as he darts in and out of moving traffic, he is hit head-on by a speeding Checker taxi. As he disappears from view we hear a long squeal of brakes and an awful crunch.

80     ON LOIS -- as she hears it too. She whirls around and hey eyes widen in horror.

                         LOIS
                (starting towards him) 
CLARK!!

     ON CLARK - picking himself up, dusting himself off, hurrying towards her again.

                         CLARK
                           (calling to her, reassuringly)
                    I'm okay.

     And he is indeed. The collision has left him unharmed and not even out of breath.

ON LOIS --  looking his way, very startled.

HER POV:  The taxi is not okay. Clark's impression is cut deeply, perfectly and unaccountably into the hood, through the engine block to the windshield.

ON LOIS - still staring. Finally, she shakes her head sharply, as if to clear it of a wild notion.

TAXI DIRVER looks puzzled.









82     INT. DAILY PLANET CITY ROOM, CLARK & LOIS' DESKS  -  DAY

     ON LOIS' DESK is a copy of that morning's paper, the headlines bold and clear:

                         MERCI, SUPERMAN!
                         French Terror Scheme "Bombs"
                         Exclusive Story by Lois Lane

Standing patiently beside the desk with a long-suffering look on his face is CLARK, listening to the good talking-to Lois is     giving him.

                    LOIS
               Look, okay, this time you were lucky. Very
               lucky. But next time you cross the street --
                      (earnestly)
               Clark, always look both ways.

Lecture over, she starts rummaging in the shopping bag we saw her carrying earlier.

                    CLARK
                      (equally earnest)
               Lois, I usually do.

                    LOIS
               Then maybe you should get your
               glasses checked.

As he touches them nervously, she pulls out a plastic bag, filled with half-a-dozen oranges cut in half.

                    CLARK
                        (piqued)
               Not everyone can have X-ray vision,
               you know.

                    LOIS
                     (lightly)
               Do I detect a note of jealousy?

From the bottom of bag she produces a fairly ancient hand-operated juicer --  the type where you put the orange half on a metal cone and then, pulling down a lever, bring the squeezer press down on it. She sets it and a large drinking glass on the desk.

               Vitamin C every day.

                    CLARK
               One thousand?? That's an awful lot of
               oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. 
I've seen them.

     LOIS
       (knowingly)
Oh sure. The American answer to everything.
Pills.
       (as she puts an orange
         in the juicer)
No, this is --
       (the magic word)
-- natural.

     She brings up the lever and bears down on the orange.

                         LOIS
                    And I also get some exercise this way.

     That's for sure. Struggling mightily, she can hardly get the lever to budge. But she smiles 
brightly as this doesn't bother her.

He repositions the orange and raises the lever. Clumsily, he bears down and gets, for his 
pains, orange pulp juice spattered down the front of his pants. Now it's his turn to play 
unperturbed.

86     EXT. SURFACE OF THE MOON

WIDE SHOT: A joint mission of Russian and American ASTRONAUTS have just landed.  There is a capsule that looks like the famous LEM, supported on four skinny, spider-like legs, with glowing metal ladders leading from its portal. 


87     INT. HOUSTON NASA CONTROL CENTER - DAY

The familiar setting: banks of computers, TECHNICIANS and CONTROLLERS who monitor the ASTRONAUTS.

     CLOSER ON TWO  CONTROLLERS: One of them, standing by the monitoring device,     
     obviously bored, sips coffee from a paper cup. The second, his feet up, idly leafs through a
     Sports Illustrated, killing time.

                         FIRST CONTROLLER

                    Hey, you follow the bouncing ball for awhile, huh?
                    It's giving me a headache. Anyway, you'd better 
check in on them.

Affirmative. And Cosmonaught Boris is getting some
soil samples.

By the way, Boris and I are getting engaged.

92     EXT. ANOTHER SECTION OF MOON

(AS PREVIOUSLY SHOT: URSA CONFRONTS ANDY AND RIPS HIS SUIT OPEN, KILLING HIM)

This scene is not typed out in the actual script, but is added here from the Tom Mankiewicz script for reference purposes.)

Astronaut Andy, in his bulky space suit and helmet, laboriously lifts some moon rocks, stands, begins loping back to his vehicle with them as Ursa suddenly lands in front of him. Andy recoils, his bug eyes clearly visible through his mask.

                         URSA
                             You.

                         What sort of creature are you?

                             A man . . .

URSA suddenly reaches out, rips the space suit down the front, tearing a great gaping hole as easily as if she were ripping tissue paper. ROBBIE'S arms flail in the air. He quickly explodes (EFFECTS) from the pressure change. URSA grins.




93     EXT. OTHER SECTION OF THE MOON

(AS PREVIOUSLY SHOT: GENERAL ZOD CONFRONTS BORIS AND KILLS HIM)

This scene is not typed out in the actual script, but is added here from the Tom Mankiewicz script for reference purposes.)

Another astronaut, BORIS, his suit bearing the insignia of the USSR, is attached by a long hose to his vehicle as he kneels a few yards away in a crater, scooping up samples of dust and putting them      in containers. CAMERA PANS: GENERAL ZOD suddenly pops out of the crater, vaulting over the lip, lands near the astonished BORIS who turns, babbling in Russian.

                                  BORIS
                                     (In Russian)
                    Who are you? Where did you . . . .

ZOD lifts BORIS' life-line in one hand and, using his fingers as a pair of scissors, simply snips it in two. Arms flailing, his screams echoing, BORIS rises like a balloon, his gravity pull destroyed as he floats up and away. ZOD watches him dispassionately.

                         ZOD
                             What a fragile sort of life form this is . . .

99     EXT.  MOON SURFACE

ZOD, URSA and NON sit amidst the debris. They have decorated themselves with the spoils: ZOD wears patches and NASA badges. URSA sports a NASA belt buckle, worn as a brooch. NON, rocking as he sits, makes frightening noises of pleasure, pleased with the mayhem he's caused.

far corner, clearly visible in a strange light. They are both reading.

     The GUARD backs up, looks into LUTHOR'S cell, irritated.

The GUARD reaches out to snatch the comic away from OTIS: his hand passes right through it as if the book were made of air. The GUARD stops, wide-eyed, steps toward LUTHOR who suddenly disappears completely. He turns back, steps toward OTIS. Now OTIS disappears, but LUTHOR has reappeared. The stunned GUARD looks down, sees he is standing in front of two beams of light. He swivels to find their source as CAMERA PANS: They are being projected from the corner by a small, complicated-looking holograph device.

     He reaches under his coat, pulls out the Black Box again, sets it on his lap, pets it.

LUTHOR
We're going North, Miss Teschmacher.
105     EXT. NIAGARA FALLS  -  DAY

     CLOSE ON A WHITE TEXTURED SURFACE, WHICH FILLS THE SCREEN. At first it
looks like some piece of the frozen 'North' to which Luthor has just alluded. BUT AS WE BEGIN TO ZOOM BACK SLOWLY. WE SEE that it is a great cataract of falling water,     
and what looked like ice is really the foaming and churning. CONTINUE TO PULL BACK TO REVEAL that we are looking at the magnificent Horseshoe Falls of Niagara Falls.

CAMERA NOW PANS AWAY FROM FALL to a typical motel of the area. A flashy neon sign coyly designed, proclaims Honeymoon Haven. Several cars are parked outside, decorated with      crepe paper ribbons and tin cans and     'Just Married' signs.

Well, here you are.

     REVERSE ON THE ROOM --  A triumph of bad taste, all velveteen and Formica,      heart-shaped cushions. In the center of the room is an open-hearth fireplace with fake

of it is a bearskin rug complete with polar bear head.

               Yes.

               Well, let me just show you some of our
               special features.

He crosses to the fireplace, switches on a switch and immediately flames shoot up from the
gas jets positioned below the fake logs.

               These are our "Flames of Love," exclusive with this 
motel in the area. Self-regulating, of course. If you 
want the flames to go higher, just pull this.

     He tugs the cord and the flames grow higher.

     ON CLARK -- In some ways, he will always be just a kid from Smallville.

                         CLARK
                    It is kinda romantic.

               For a nominal charge, our staff photographer will

And on that note he leaves them alone.

108     CLARK sits on the bed which starts to vibrate. He jumps up in surprise.

TIGHT ANGLE --  Beside the bed, on a table, is a box with a coin slot. The legend on it reads:

                    'Magic Fingers'
Vibrating Bed

For One hour

                         CLARK

Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes.

                              CLARK
       (earnestly)
But this should be exposed. They get     kids here who     
are just starting out in life and they take them for 
every nickel they can get. That's what Perry says.

As he discovers a bucket of Champaign on the TV with a little card beside it:

                         CLARK
       (rather impressed)
On the other hand . . ..this is pretty nice. 
"Complimentary champagne."  And look

     He holds up a cellophane-wrapped orchid.

CLARK
       (brightly)
A "complimentary corsage."

     LOIS
       (ever the cynic)
Oh sure, everything is complimentary.
Until you get the bill.

     He unwraps the orchid and brings it to her, rather shyly.  MOVE IN TIGHTER. She stands

109     EXT.  LOOKOUTPOINT,   NIAGARA FALLS  -  DAY

ON A SMALL BOY romping rather abandonedly near an iron guard rail as we hear:

                         MOTHER (o.s.)
                    Jason!  Watch out!

As she appears and grabs him none too gently, PULL BACK TO SEE that we are at a 
vantage point overlooking the Falls. The fence of parallel iron bars keeps the TOURISTS, who are looking through binocular machines from falling over the edge.

VARIOUS SHOTS: The area is filled with FAMILIES, snapping away with Instamatics, and 
NEWLYWED COUPLES, all holding hands. Not far away is a hot dog stand doing a brisk 
business.

A fine mist rises from the Falls and hangs in the air. People are constantly wiping their 
glasses and talking a blue streak.

110     CLOSE ON LOOKPUT POINT AREA where Clark and Lois are standing, wearing shiny new wedding rings, doing their newlywed number.

                    CLARK
               We should be holding hands. They're all 
holding hands.

     Almost every couple around them holds hands as they look  at the Falls.

     FAVORING LOIS

                              LOIS
                         Afraid to let go, probably. When they
                         let go, they head for the lawyer.

                         I don't know, they look pretty happy to me...

                              LOIS
                              (cracking wise)
                         That's because you can hardly see through
                         those things.

111     NEW ANGLE, CLOSE:  His glasses are indeed completely misted up. Having X-Ray vision, 
he's never even noticed.

                         LOIS
                          (taking a handkerchief
        out of her purse)
How can you walk around like that?

And so saying, she snatches the glasses off his face. he stiffens, afraid that he might suddenly look a lot like Superman to her.

But she isn't even looking at him. She is busy cleaning his glasses and talking a blue streak.

LOIS
You really should pay attention to things like
that, Clark. I know it sounds corny, but my 
mother always says, you only get one pair
                         of eyes ----
     She smiles up at him.

                              LOIS
                         Here. Don't say I never did anything for you. I'll 
even let you keep the handkerchief if ---

C.U. LOIS: She is just about to set the glasses back on his nose when she gets her first look      at him without them. She does a tiny, quizzical take.

C.U. CLARK -- Aware he is being scrutinized. He holds his breath.

She cocks her head and leans towards him inquiringly, when:







112     Suddenly, little Jason runs INTO FRAME darting between them. He is one of those kids who 
just can't stand still.  Lois is jostled and completely distracted by this interruption. Clark is
vastly relieved. He casually retrieves his glasses and puts them back on as Jason's FATHER,
this time, retrieves the hyperactive child.

FATHER
Jason!
        (to Clark and Lois) 
'Scuse me.

     The father wears a gray suit similar to the one Clark wears .

113     Lois watches as he hauls the kid away.

                              LOIS
                                (turning back to Clark)
                         Hey, are you hungry? I'm hungry.

                              CLARK
                                  (secure behind his glasses 
                       again, he smiles at her) 
Lois, you're amazing.

     LOIS
Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.

     CLARK
No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's 
most awesome spectacles and the whole time 
you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed?

     LOIS
Frankly, once you've seen Superman in action, 
Niagara Falls tends to leave you cold.

     CLARK looks in the direction of the parking lot and Hot Dog Stand.

                              CLARK
                               (getting the message)
Two hot dogs -- coming up.

     He turns and goes.

                              LOIS
                         And orange juice...but only if it's freshly
                         squeezed.



114     ON JASON -- now standing very dangerously between the iron bars of the guardrail. All this is for someone's benefit as he calls out:

JASON
                            (big impish grin) 
Hey, becha can't do this!

     Suddenly he loses his footing and almost goes over. His mother screams. But:

115     A gray-suited arm shoots INTO FRAME, pulling him to safety. PAN UP THE ARM TO      REVEAL that it's not Papa, but Clark.

                         CLARK
                           (big brotherly)
                    Hey, Tarzan, this isn't the jungle.

     Mother now grabs Jason away as if Clark were about to molest him.

116     TWP SHOT --  MOTHER AND JASON

                         MOTHER
                    Didn't I tell you never to talk to strange men?

     And with that she deals him a     resounding smack. As     the kid howls,     PAN TO LOIS,     watching it all, appalled. As she shakes her head:

117     EXT. HOT DOG STAND, NIAGARA FALL.S - DAY

     With a little sigh, Clark gets on the end of a very long line. As he waits patiently, bored.:

118     EXT. LOOKOUT POINT, NIAGARA FALLS - DAY

     FAVORING LOIS AND JASON -- The boy dangles through the bars, doing bits for the      benefit of Lois. She watches him with dismay, unwilling to alert Mama, who will only 
wallop him again, but very nervous about the show she is getting.

ON LOIS - looking at him disapprovingly.

ON JASON -- A high kick or two and a quick grin, when suddenly his hand slips. The grin 
turns to a terrified cry as he plummets down the Falls.

119     FOLLOW HIM as we hear o.s., his mother's piercing scream. He tumbles through the air, 
arms splayed out, clutching at nothing, and now there are other  screams, pandemonium      above, off screen.

120     NEW WIDER ANGLE: Suddenly a blue streak zooms out of the sky. It is Superman, 
     swooping up the kid just before he hits the rapids.


121     ON LOIS -- watching, thrilled.

                         LOIS 
                   (cheering)
 way to go, Superman!

     IN QUICK CUTS:

122     1.  CUSTOMERS deserting the hot dog stand in droves rushing to see the rescue.

123     2.  FOLKS crowding the binocular machines, focusing them to see Superman, who is now 
     flying up with the kid.

124     3.  OTHERS cheering and applauding as Jason is brought back to his near-hysterical mother.

125     CLOSER --  as Superman sets Jason, safe and sound, on terra firma.

JASON
                             (he loved it)
                    Again!  Again!

                    Sorry. Only one ride to a customer.

     And off he soars to the click of cameras and more cheers.

126     ON LOIS --  waving frantically to attract his attention.

                         LOIS
                    Hey, wait! Superman, it's me. It's Lo--

     Too late. He's gone. As Lois stands there dejectedly.

                         MOTHER (o.s.)
                    Now you're gonna get it!

     Sound: A smack. Next sound: A howling child.

     Lois pays it little attention. She is busy putting two and two together.

                           (miffed)

127     EXT. BEHIND HOT DOG STAND, NIAGARA FALLS  - DAY

     Now a deserted area, everyone having hurried off to see the action. Superman lands. 
FOLLOW HIM as he moves toward the hot dog stand and reappears from behind it as      CLARK KENT complete with gray suit, glasses.

He is all alone with a tray of hot dogs. Finally with a little shrug, he picks up two of them 
and starts back. He gets about four feet away and then the honest afterthought hits him. He      steps back to the counter, fishes in his pocket, and leaves a dollar laying there.

128     EXT. LOOKOUT POINT,  NIAGARA FALLS - DAY

     TWO SHOT -- As the crowd behind disperses, still excited, Lois is intent only on her own
conversation with Clark.

                    LOIS
Where were you?

     CLARK
      (handing her a hot dog, 
        very defensively)
I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?

comes around, you disappear.

                    Y'know I never started to put it together before, 
Clark. And that's funny because a good reporter isn't
     supposed to let anything slip by her. But I'm beginning 
to get it now . . . . . .

Clark looks more and more nervous the closer she gets to it.

Look, maybe you ought to take a walk and clear
your head. I'II meet you back at the motel.

     Desperate to get out of this tight spot, he turns and starts to walk away.

You heard me. I'm so sure you're Superman, I'm

into Superman . . . and if I'm wrong . . ..
        (true grit)
 . . .well, then you'll have one hell of a story.

CLARK

You've got some imagination, Lois. For a minute

And with that she calmly climbs over the bridge rail and before the disbelieving eyes of 
Clark Kent, jumps into the raging Niagara river.

131     WIDE SHOT, ANGLE DOWN --  Staying afloat in these rapids is much more difficult than Lois imagined. She is struggling. On the opposite bank is a great tree, one massive half-dead branch hanging out over the water.

137     EFFECTS: He beams a ray of intense Heat-Vision at the rotting branch and burns
 it through. It drops off, tumbling into the swirling current. It floats wildly downstream 
towards Lois.

                         CLARK  (o.s.) 
Lois! Lois, grab hold! Grab that branch!

138     Struggling against the strong current, she manages to get hold of it.

139     ON CLARK: Quietly, he exhales a great gust of  Super-Breath.


140     EFFECTS: ( ON THE RIVER) This     blast of air, like a sudden favorable breeze, sends the 
branch with Lois holding onto it shooting across the river, right up to the bank and dry land.

141     NEW ANGLE -- Clark comes running off the bridge clambers down the side of the bank to 
help pull her to safety.

142     He grabs the other end of the branch she is clutching and is using it to hoist her to safety.

143     He has no sooner got her close to dry land again then he loses his own footing . In a very 
convincing and very undignified fashion, he tumbles into the drink himself.

LOIS
                                      (in dismay and disbelief) 
Oh Clark, no!

     CLARK
                  (making a great show of 
                    wildly thrashing about
        in the water)
Lois, help! I can't --
        (starts to go under)
I can't swim -- !

     Lois holds onto the bank, extending the branch she is still holding from her own rescue.

                              LOIS
                         Here!

     Clark reaches and misses.

                              LOIS
                               (frantically)
                         Come on, Clark! Get it, for God's sake! And 
hang on!

     He finally manages to grab hold.

                              LOIS
                         That's it! Okay, take it easy now, I've got you . . .

143     With a great effort, she hauls him up onto the riverbank. He looks as wet, bedraggled and 
miserable as she does, except that on her it's adorable. Lois looks him up and down and
shakes her head ruefully as he stands there dripping.

LOIS
                         Look what I thought was Superman.

     Clark shrug and smiles sheepishly.

144     EXT. HOUSTON - DAY

     WIDE LONG SHOT: A bleak, scrubby landscape. A smallish lake in the center of it.

Zod, Non and Ursa fly down spaced widely apart, and land on various areas of the region. 
Non and Ursa are on one side of the lake, General Zod on the other.

ON ZOD - contemplating a vista that is less than thrilling.

                    ZOD
               So this is the planet Houston . . .

                    URSA
                     (calling from across the lake) 
What shall we do now?

     ZOD
Stay. I will come to you.

     ZOD --  He starts to walk towards URSA and NON and steps off the bank into the lake. To 
his surprise, he quickly finds himself up to his waist in cold, wet water.

                                                       CONTINUED
144     CONTINUED

ZOD
                         (thinks it over, feels it)
                    Hmmmmmmm. . . . . . . . . . . . . . 

     He walks forward again. But this time he walks on the water instead of in it.

145     We CUT to another part of the lake and see the reaction t ZOD'S feat on the face of an 
elderly FISHERMAN, sitting in boat concealed by some reeds.

146     FAVORING URSA AND NON - Behind them, in b.g. we see ZOD walking across the water 
towards them. As URSA looks around:

Sound: the hissing rattle of a rattlesnake.

URSA looks in the direction of the snake.

148     ON THE GROUND -- A few feet in front of her, a rattlesnake has crawled from beneath a 
rock.  His head rises up, his tongue flicks menacingly, his tail rattles.  URSA looks curiously 
at this unknown visitor.

                    URSA     
                    (bemused)
               A primitive sort of life form . . . 

She picks up the snake.

149     INSERT:  the rattler, furious, hisses and strikes. Its fangs sink quickly into URSA'S wrist.

150     FAVORING URSA - Unhurt, but annoyed, she throws it to the ground. She scowls and
glowers at the     snake.

     EFFECTS: A beam of Heat-Vision emanates from eyes, striking the rattlesnake and      instantly immolating it and the surrounding grass. It is as much of a surprise to URSA as     it
     was to the snake.

151     WIDER SHOT - ZOD has arrived.

                         URSA 
           (immensely pleased with her 
  stunt, she turns to Zod)
Did you see that? Did you see what I did?

               
                                                       CONTINUED



151      CONTINUED:

     ON ZOD -- not particularly impressed.

ON NON quite impressed in his dumb, brutish way. He looks at the carcass of the burnt snake, then at URSA, trying to puzzle it out. He touches this thick fingers to his eyes, attempting to figure the trick. His brow knots in concentration.

     WIDER ANGLE --  She looks at the dead snake on the ground.

URSA
                                 (wanting to impress Zod)
                    Remarkable! I have powers beyond 
                    reason.
ZOD
       (world-weary)
We all have them, my dear. 

     Ursa looks a little put out at his lack of response. As he turns away to look about the           terrain.

ON NON --  concentrating fiercely on the abandoned snake, he narrows his eyes, tries to make Heat-Vision happen. But nothing comes. He picks up the carcass, holds it in front of his face, scowls exaggeratedly and tries again. He grunts with the effort.

But to no avail. NON is frustrated. He tries again.

CUT TO:

152     INT. LIVING ROOM, HONEYMOON HAVEN MOTEL SUITE  -  DAY 

C.U.  Fire flames in E.C.U.

Th curtains have been drawn. Lois, in a voluminous terrycloth bathrobe, sits on the bearskin rug, brushing out her long hair in front of the fire. She reaches over and pulls the cord to raise the "Flames of Love." As the flames shoot higher, PULL BACK TO REVEAL Clark, now in shirt and slacks, leaning on the mantelpiece. In the firelight she is warm and beautiful and he looks down at her adoringly.

                    LOIS
                     (rattling on)
               God, I must've looked like a idiot -
               jumping in the river to wait for Mister
               wonderful.
                     (smarting)
               Who obviously had better things to do.

152     CONTINUED:

     She gets up, still talking, leaving her hairbrush on the edge of the fireplace. She crosses to 
the dressing table, sits on the red velvet stool and gazes in the heart-shaped mirror.

                    LOIS
                    (embarrassed)
               I'm so embarrassed. Promise you'll never 
               tell anyone?
                    (pushing things aside on
                      the dressing table, hunting
                       something)
               I know I had a comb here somewhere.

     ON CLARK:  He looks at the dressing table.

153     EFFECTS:  X-RAY VISION

     POV:  The comb is in a top drawer, under a scarf.

154     ON CLARK:  Who, of course, says nothing about it.

     EIDE ANGLE - Lois is still hunting for the comb as she speaks.

                         LOIS
                    And then thinking you were - I mean, if
                    Perry White ever heard about this . . . 
                          (she shudders to think, then
                            looks around in mild frustration)
                    Swell. I've not only lost my mind. I've 
                    lost my comb.
                           (holding out her hand)
                    Pass me that brush over there, will you?

     He walks toward the "Flames of Love" but he can't take his eyes off her. As he takes another 
step, he trips over a totally unexpected obstacle - the great open-jawed bear head of the rug. 
he falls forward, sprawling, and his hand plunges right into the flames.

Lois screams, jumps up from her chair.

Clark pulls his hand out of the fire quickly.

She runs to him, dropping on her knees beside him.

                    LOIS
               Oh my God! Your hand -

She takes it, terrified, and looks at it.

155     INSERT:  The fist is closed.

     Tenderly, she unfolds it, baring the palm. There are no burns, no marks at all.

156     TIGHT TWO SHOT - She looks down at it in wonder, then up at him.

                         LOIS
                         (almost awed)
                    It's true. It's true.

                         CLARK
                    Lois, I . . . 

                         LOIS
                        (trying to hold in
                          her exultation)
                    I was right. you are Superman.

                         CLARK
                    Oh come on, that's ridic -

     But he can't finish the sentence. He jumps up and turns his back on her in anguish and 
frustration.

Lois, a bit hesitantly goes over to him and gently touches his back.

                    LOIS
                    (small voice)
               I'm . . . sorry?

Clark turns back to her, very serious, very upset.

                    CLARK
               You don't have anything to be sorry      about.
                      ("kicking himself")
               How could I . . .

                    LOIS
               Maybe you wanted to.

                    CLARK
               I didn't think I wanted to.

                    LOIS

               Well, not in your mind, but maybe . . .deep

          "What's happening." Oh, is that the understatement
          of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . 
          talk?

               CLARK
          I guess it would be all right if -
                (making a tough decision)
          Lois, now that you know me, I think you ought
          to know it all.

     She comes very close to him.

                         LOIS
                    I want to.

     She lays a gentle hand on his arm. he looks down at it and then at her.

     Clark smiles; they look in each other's eyes as the CAMERA MOVES IN. Over this we 
HEAR LUTHOR (o.s.)

157     (NOTE: The following sequence is composed of three elements:

               a.   new voice-over material for Luthor and Eve.
               b.   new material for Lara and the various Elders
      who appear on crystals in the fortress.
c.    previously shot material for Luthor and Eve in the Fortress.
     
     The first section below is new dialogue to be laid over the previously shot      LONG     SHOTS of Luthor and Eve on the snowmobile moving across the arctic landscapes.

     The middle section, inside the Fortress, consists of a scene already shot involving Luthor          and Eve wandering around the place, finding the crystals etc.

Following that, beginning with the first materialization of Krypton Elders on the crystals, we 
combine new material with old. The key is simply this: all lines and reactions by Luthor and Eve have been previously shot and are to be intercut with new material. For purposes of clarity, we have re-typed these already shot lines again.

The final sequence consists of new dialogue to be laid over the previously shot LONG 
SHOT of Luthor and Eve seen from behind, leaving the fortress on the snowmobile.)

     LONG SHOTS of Luthor and Eve on the Snowmobile heading toward the Fortress:

                    The greatest virtue is that which ignores any
                    thought of personal aggrandizement or reward . . .

                    So much for Moral Rearment. Give me 
                    another one.

     As he puts it in, the disembodied voice again is heard:

161     The image of a SECOND ELDER materializes.

                         SECOND ELDER
                    "Trees" by Joyce Kilmer of the planet Earth.
                    "I think that I shall never see/ A poem as

our planets history.

     LUTHOR
Now This I want to hear.

     LARA
For many eons the peoples of our world have 
lived together in harmony. Then there appeared
among us three anti-social elements - what
on Earth are classified as "criminals."

The three proved - after exhaustive efforts -
incapable of rehabilitation. Now as you know,
we had no death penalty -

     LUTHOR
Sensible enough.

     LARA
And so our scientists constructed, from an 
irreversible mathematical equation, the 
Phantom Zone. In it we imprisoned these
three arch-villains for all eternity.

     LUTHOR
No possibility for parole?

     LARA
The Elders have, of course, thought long and
hard about that question.

     LUTHOR
       (pleased)
I asked the right question. 

LARA
      (uneasily)
The one danger we have considered is 
that the Phantom Zone might - we cannot
predict - just might be cracked by a nuclear 
explosion in space. I cannot say I am glad
you asked me that -

I didn't ask her anything . . .

The first of these three - and their leader -
was General Zod . . .

166     EXT. EAST HOUSTON OUTSKIRTS  -  DAY

     A patrol car with a red dome light on its roof comes down the road.

167     INT. POLICE CAR  -  DAY

The town's TWO POLICEMEN sit in the front seat. The driver is the DEPUTY, in his late     20's. Seated beside him is the SHERIFF, a paunchy guy in his 40's. They are both, in current 
parlance, real shit-kickers,

As we meet them, they are in the middle of a conversation.

                    SHERIFF
               Me, Spring.

                    DEPUTY
               Not me. I'm summer.

               SHERIFF
                           (this strikes him
                      as damned odd)
               Summer?

                    DEPUTY
               Summer.
                       (explaining)
               Y'know it gets real warm and everything . . . 

                    SHERIFF
                        (he thinks it over awhile, 
          then makes up his mind)
               Nope . . . Spring's better, That's my
feelin' on it.

                    DEPUTY
               Suit yourself.

They spot the villains on the road.

168     POV:  Up ahead on the road, Ursa, Zod, and Non are ranged across the asphalt, waiting.

                         DEPUTY
                    I don't know, but from the look of 'em,
                    I'll bet they're from Los Angeles.

     He blows the horn, as the car gets closer to them.

169     EXT. EAST HOUSTON ROAD  -  DAY

     The three stand, unmoving, as the car approaches.

                         SHERIFF
                    Hey, y'all get your butts outta the road!

     The horn blows insistently, the red light goes on  in the revolving dome.

                         ZOD
                    I like the globe that flashes red like our
                    Krypton sun. But not this irritating noise.

     He strides toward the car.

                    be a peacemaker.

The Deputy unclips from its rack their sawed-off shotgun. Then he opens the door and steps out.

171     EXT. EAST HOUSTON ROAD  -  DAY

     The three step closer as he emerges.

                         DEPUTY
                    Awright, just what in the hell --

     Ursa touches the badge on his shirt front curiously.

                         URSA
                    What is this symbol? Do you follow
                    another leader?

                         DEPUTY
                          (confused)
                    Follow the Leader . . . ?

     She rips the badge off and pins it on herself, adding to her purloined NASA patches.

                         DEPUTY
                         (stunned at the effrontery)
                    Holeee skunk sweat!

     He raises the shotgun, points it at them.

     ON THE CAR, FAVORING THE SHERIFF: watching circumspectly.

The three have no reaction at all to the raised shotgun. Zod looks at it curiously.

                    ZOD
               A weapon of some sort?

172     EFFECTS:  As Zod stares intently at the shotgun, the weapon jerks out of the Deputy's hands 
and levitates in the air. Directed by Zod's gaze, it slowly floats in mid-air and moves a few 
feet toward the General, presenting itself barrel first.




               
173     MED. C.U. DEPUTY -- dumbfounded.

                         DEPUTY
                    How in hell did you do that??

174     ON THE CAR:  The Sheriff is practically wetting his pants.

175     Now Zod, with dispassionate and scientific curiosity grabs hold of the gun with one hand and      reaches toward the trigger with the other. Remember, it is pointing right at his chest.

     He pulls the trigger.

     Bang! The gun fires.

176     QUICK C.U. NON -- Delightedly surprised by the explosion, like a child watching a firecracker for the first time.

177     ON ZOD --  The bullets have no effect on him.

178     REACTIONS: SHERIFF AND DEPUTY, both awe-struck, incredulous, terrified. The Sheriff ducks down under the dashboard, fearing the worst.

                         DEPUTY
                    Jesus H. Christ!

     Done with it, Zod tosses the shotgun on the ground. It rolls under the car.

                         ZOD
                         (to Ursa)
                    Crude noise-maker . . . 

179     Exactly why Non like it. He wants to try. he grabs hold of the under-carriage of the car and lifts it easily, simply to get the gun beneath it, c.f. baby Superman in Kansas (Pt. I)

180     INT. CAR  -  DAY

     The Sheriff, frightened to death, is flung against the door.

181     EXT. EAST HOUSTON ROAD  -  DAY

     With a grunt of satisfaction, Non retrieves the gun. He simply drops the car.

182     ON THE CAR -- The Sheriff inside, and lands, bouncing at the side of the road.

183     ON NON -- He lumbers over to the car, now distracted by another toy. Leaning over , he tips the red glass dome light from the roof and holds it out to Zod, as an offering.

184     Zod, uninterested, turns away.

185     EXT. SKY  -  DAY

     MUSIC: The love theme soars.

     MED. LONG SHOT:  And so does Superman, as he flies through the sky with Lois in his arms. Suddenly, in an excess of exuberance he swings into a great loop-the-loop. Lois shrieks and clings to him even tighter, like a young girl on a roller coaster. Superman grins and hugs her to him protectively, like her young swain on the roller coaster. HOLD CAMERA STATIONARY as they fly off, getting smaller and smaller, a joyously cartwheeling dot that disappears in the blue.

186     INT. FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE  -  DAY

     FULL SHOT -- Superman and Lois land at the door of the Fortress. He sets her gently on her feet.

     CLOSER as he steps down, then turns to see Lois still standing there, dazzled by the crystalline structure.

                         SUPERMAN
                         (holding his arm
                           open to her)
                    You must be freezing.

                         LOIS
                    I must be. But I'm not.
                          (looking around, filled
                            with wonder)
                    Your home. This is your home.

                         SUPERMAN
                    Well . . . it's been more like a fortress than 
                    a home.
                           (he takes her hand,
                            leads her inside)
                    Until now.

187      EXT.  MAIN STREET, EAST HOUSTON  -  DAY
 
A  general store, and beside it, a billboard. Next to that, a little post office, with a flagpole in      front of it flying the American flag. Next to that a saloon. On its roof is one of those rather 
elaborate TV antennas used in faraway small towns like this to bring in a decent picture from the transmitter. next to that a wooden building that might be  garage or a former stable.

ON A TWELVE YEAR OLD BOY, sitting on the steps of the Post office, reading a comic book. This is WILLIE. As he turns a page and idly glances up, his jaw drops.



188     PAN WITH HIS GAZE, past a pick-up truck loaded with crates of turkeys and parked in      font of the saloon, to SEE what amazes Willie: It is Zod, Ursa, and Non who have come to 
     town.

     AS Zod and Ursa stride into the saloon, HOLD ON NON, who still carries the glass domed
     police light. From the intensity of his self-absorbed expression, we can tell he is still trying 
to puzzle out this Heat-Vision routine.

He stops and focuses on the open wooden tailgate of the pick-up truck. he narrows his eyes in      imitation of Zod and grunts with effort.

189     EFFECTS:  A feeble, pitiful beam of Heat-Vision finally emanates from his eyes. it strikes the tailgate and chars a small, smouldering spot, much like a child's woodburning kit.

     By George, he thinks he's got it! As Non growls with satisfaction.

190     INT. SALOON, EAST HOUSTON  -  DAY

A dim light hole-in-the-wall joint. THREE BURLY GOOD OLD BOYS are putting back 
beers at a center table. In between chug-a-lugs, two of them, sleeves rolled up to bare arms  
like trees, are arm-wrestling. After considerable straining, WRESTLER ONE (J.J.) forces
the arm of WRESTLER TOW (Boog) down on the table.

                    J.J.
                     (in triumph)
               See there, Boog. Just 'cause you're ugly
               don't mean you're strong.

He picks up his beer mug in his massive mitt and then slowly sets it down again as he 
notices Zod and Ursa in the bar.

                    BOOG
                      (seeing them)
               Oh my God! The circus is in town!

                    GUY AT THE BAR
               Hey, J. J., check out the bride of
               Frankenstein.

                    J.J.
                       (slapping his knee,
                         leering at Ursa)
               Hey, sweet thing! Set those buns down here!

190     CONTINUED

     ON URSA -- Outraged, eyes blazing, she approaches him.

                         URSA
                           (icily)
                    Let's just hold hands.

     She sits across from him, her elbow on the table, her hand open, ready to arm wrestle. J.J.      is very amused.

                         J.J.
                         (engulfing her 
                           hand in his)
                    Don't wanna spoil your manicure now.

     The words are barely out of his mouth when she flicks his arm down. it is done with such 
super-power that his arm crashes right throught the table, bringing J.J., table, and all smashing to the floor, table broken in half. 

Enraged, Boog leaps from his chair, his great height and girth revealed for the first time.

191     EXT. MAIN STREET, EAST HOUSTON  - DAY

     From down the street the Sheriff comes running into town, followed by the Deputy. The 
former is considerably the worse for the wear: tattered uniform, bruised and filthy face
and quite a tale he wants to tell.

As he waves his arms and comes yelling, Townspeople come over.

                    WILLIE
               Sheriff! What happened?

192     INT. SALOON  -  DAY

     The furious Boog advances on Ursa.

                         BOOG
                    Girl or no girl, you are gonna be
                    spittin' teeth!

     Zod steps in front of the man and gives him the slightest little push.

     The effect is remarkable, as this light touch sends the beefy Boog smashing right through the 
     wall, splintering it. Instantly followed by:




193     EXT. MAIN STREET, EAST HOUSTON  -  DAY

                         SHERIFF
                    You ain't never gonna believe what
                    just happened to --

     Crash! Boog comes hurtling out through the saloon wall, goes flying tight through the turkey      truck and hurtles out the other side in a storm of feathers and a chorus of gobbles, and 
bounces to a halt at the Sheriff's feet.

194     Zod and Ursa stride out of the saloon and into the street where Non joins them.

195     WIDE ANGLE -- As DINO, from across the street, pulls himself together, and faces off 
against his three nemeses. It looks like the classic High Noon shot.

                    DINO
                    (leveling a shotgun
                      at them)
               Awright, just get 'em up and keep 'em up.
               
                    ZOD
                    (thin-lipped)
               These humans are beginning to annoy me.

196     EFFECTS: A beam of intense light suddenly shoots from Zod's eyes, across the street, past 
the cowering townspeople. When it strikes DINO it passes through his body like an
electrical charge, causing him to drop his gun and levitating him 30 feet in the air.

The crowd gasps. DINO hangs there in mid-air, terrified. The beam of light seems to hold 
him there.

A woman screams. Willie, crying, runs to Zod.

                    WILLIE
               Please, Mister!

               He is a general.

                    WILLIE
                     (pleading)
               Please, Mister General! Please let
               my daddy down!

                    ZOD
               Whatever you say.


197     NEW ANGLE -- as Zod snaps off the beam of light. Suddenly Dino drops from the sky like a 
sack of potatoes. He hits the ground with a thud.

198     ON WILLIE -- paralyzed with horror.

199     WIDE ANGLE -- The townspeople huddle together around Willie, murmuring fearfully.

                         URSA
                          (imperiously)
                    Silence! The General wishes to speak.

     Zod strikes a pose -- arms akimbo, his cruel face impassive, his voice loud and commanding.

                    ZOD
               I am General Zod. Your ruler.
                     (the muttering breaks out
                       again; he raises his voice,
                       stilling it)
               Yes, today we begin a NEW ORDER!

ON WILLIW -- Pretending to be listening to General Zod, he is in fact, edging backwards
through the crowd, never looking away from Zod but slipping to the rear all the while, as:

                    ZOD (o.s.)
               Each of you -- every man, woman and child --
               will march proudly in the NEW ORDER! Your
               land, your possessions, your very lives will gladly
               be given in tribute to me! General Zod!

WE FOLLOW WILLIE as, with careful backward strides, he breaks out of the back of the
crowd. He darts around the back of the saloon.

200     EXT. BEHIND THE SALOON, EAST HOUSTON  -  DAY

     As Zod rants off-screen, Willie runs to an old grazing mare tethered behind the saloon. In 
     one jump he is on her back, loosing her rope, clinging to her neck, ready for the wild 
bareback ride.

                    WILLIE
                    (whispering prayerfully)
               Come on, we gotta get help! Go! Go, Betsy!

Nothing. For one agonizing second it seems as if the old horse does not even comprehend the
command.

                                                  CONTINUED



200     CONTINUED
                         
                    WILLIE
                     (despairing)
               Oh, Betsy -- PLEASE!

Suddenly, with a toss of her head, the mare catches on and with Willie clinging on for dear
life, she gallops off towards the horizon.


201     EXT. MAIN STREET, EAST HOUSTON  -  DAY

     WIDE ANGLE -- As Zod continues haranguing the crowd.

                         ZOD
                    In return for your obedience, you will enjoy
                    my generous protection. In other words, you
                    will be allowed to live.
                           (lets that sink in)
                    No one may leave without my permis--

     Suddenly Zod is silent. His eyes narrow as he spots something on the horizon.

202     HIS POV:  Willie and Betsey a hundred yards away are racing towards safety.

203     FAVORING THE VILLAINS -- Zod's wrath is terrible.

                         ZOD
                    I said no one leaves!

     He snaps his fingers. Non raises the red glass dome of the police car and hurls it, like a 
grenade.

204     LONG, WIDE SHOT -- The red dome hits (at super-speed) the galloping dot in the 
background.

205     EFFECTS:  The dot (boy and horse) explode in a burst of shattering red glass.

206     ON THE CROWD

                         A WOMAN
                         (horrified)
                    He was only a boy!

                         URSA
                          (pleased)
                    Who will never become a man.


207     INT. FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE

     MED. SHOT -- Superman and Lois are standing beside the Memory Crystal Bank. He is in 
the middle of giving her the guided tour. She listens, enthralled, as he explains the Green 
Crystal which he handles almost with reverence.

                    SUPERMAN
               . . . and then, after my father died -- my
               Earth father, I mean -- this crystal, it . . . 
               it's hard to explain but . . .
                    (searches for the word)
               . . . it called to me. Somehow it brought me 
               here and helped me to build this place. It
               built everything, really. And then, that was 
when I found out who I really was and what 
I had to do . . . 


He slips the Green Crystal back into its place in the Memory Bank.

     TRACK WITH THEM as LOIS follows him eagerly into another area of the Fortress.

                         SUPERMAN
                    So --
                           (shyly houseproud)
                    I hope you like it.

                         LOIS
                    Like it? It's magnificent!
                           (shyly)
                    Not that it couldn't use a woman's touch.
                    Especially around dinner time.

                         SUPERMAN
                    Dinner. Oh yes.
                          (a little embarrassed)
                    I'm sorry, I just never do much about
                    that.
                          (quickly)
                    But tonight -- I mean, anything you want,
                    Lois.

     C.U. LOIS -- a wonderful smile begins to form.






208     EXT. TROPICAL ISLAND  -  DAY

     WE CUT to an E.L.S. of a tropical paradise. The CAMERA is looking from a peak over a 
     tropical rain forest to the blue waters of the ocean surrounding this tropical island.

     SUPERMAN, a tiny speeding figure in blue, swoops in over the water towards the rain 
forest.

209     EXT. FOREST AND WATERFALL  -  DAY

     WE CUT inside the rain forest to a wide shot by a glittering pool, surrounded by orchids
     and frangipani vines. SUPERMAN lands by the pool and begins choosing the most elegant 
blooms. A few of the more unusual tropical fauna regard his arrival with interest.

SUPERMAN then takes off in a blue flash past camera with the exotic flowers in his arms.

214     EXT. LONDON SHIPYARD  -  DAY

GROUP SHOT on a LADY and some DIGNITARIES, including an ADMIRAL, standing on 
a bunting-draped platform about to launch a ship with the traditional bottle of champagne. Said bottle is attached to the customary rope, held by the lady.

SOUND:  drum rolls let us know a military band is on the premises.

                    LADY
               I name this ship BANNISTER. God bless her 
               and all who sail in her.

She lets go of the champagne bottle. As it starts to swing toward the prow.

215     EFFECTS:  Suddenly a blue streak whizzes between ship and lady. A split-second later it is 
gone. And so is the champagne.

216     As the piece of rope hits the prow, limply:

     MUSIC:  the band strikes up a tune.

     The ship, which doesn't know the difference, starts to slip into the water.

     SOUND:  applause from the spectators.

     Willy-nilly, the boat has in any case been launched -- champagne or no.

ON THE LADY  - She looks confused, as if she's sure there was a bottle there a moment ago.

                                                  CONTINUED

                    Oh well . . . . . . 

217     ANGLE UP on Superman flying away.

                         SUPERMAN
                         (calls out)
                    The next round's on me!

218     INT. GROCERY STORE, SUSSEX  -  DAY

     ON AN OLD LADY, the proprietor, seated behind the counter of a little neighborhood      grocery store, engrossed in reading Weekend.

     SOUND: a little bell over the door rings as the door to the shop has been entered.

     She looks up momentarily, then goes back to her article.

NEW ANGLE -- This guy in a blue outfit with a red cape and "S" on his chest, sparkling wine and rose in one hand, comes toward her carrying a dozens eggs.

                    SUPERMAN
               Excuse me, how much . . . . 

                    OLD LADY
                   (not even bothering to
                     look up from magazine)
               Forty-five p, dear. . . 

219     EXT. STREET  -  PISA  - ITALY  -  DAY

     CAMAERA CLOSE on a souvenir stand in PISA: the halves holds rows and rows of cheap
plastic souvenir Leaning Towers of Pisa, all leaning identically; above are rows of picture 
postcards with the same identical view An ITALIAN SHOPKEEPER admires his stock as he gets ready for the day's tourists. CAMERA WIDENS: in the distant b.g. is the real Leaning 
     Tower of Pisa, tilted at the same familiar angle as all the plastic replicas. The SHOPKEEPER
     hums happily as CAMERA PANDS UP to an approaching blue dot in the sky.

220     EXT. SKY ABOVE PISA  -  DAY

     Superman flies blithely, lovestruck, through the sky, a bottle of wine in one hand, a bouquet
     of beautiful flowers in the other.

221     EXT. TOWER OF PISA  -  DAY

     A blue flash circles the Tower with tremendous speed.

222     INSERT SHOT  -  BASE OF TOWER

     A huge cracked cornerstone at the higher base of the Tower suddenly crumbles from the 
impact of Superman's incredible speed.

223     ANGLE ON TOWER     

     The Leaning Tower rights itself into an erect position.

224     EXT. PISA SOUVENIR STAND  -  DAY

     The SHOPKEEPER dusts his shelves, hums to himself. He turns automatically to look at
     the source of his success, his jaw drops. The Leaning Tower isn't leaning anymore; it's
     just another tower. The SHOPKEEPER clutches his heart melodramatically.

                         SHOPKEEPER
                    Mamma Mia!

     The SHOPKEEPER looks at the Tower, then back at his wares, then back at the Tower - 
     screams after SUPERMAN as the blue dot disappears in the sky.

                         SHOPKEEPER
                    Super-Cretino! Stronzo . . .

     Hysterical, he makes an obscene gesture, turns, begins smashing his wares off the shelf.

225     INT. FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE  -  DAY

     Lois has returned to the Memory Crystal Bank, radiant with happiness, eyes wide with the
     wonder of everything that has happened to her in the past few hours.

     She leans over and takes the Green Crystal out, turns it over and over, studying it fondly as
     if it were her beloved's baby pictures.

                         LOIS
                    I guess you knew him when.

     Suddenly:

     SOUND: a rush of air, the sound we associate with Superman landing.

                         SUPERMAN (o.s.)
                         (he sounds like the 
                           young husband back
                           from work)
                    Hi, Lois! I'm home!

     Happily, she runs to greet him, carelessly putting the Green Crystal down.

     INSERT:  The Green Crystal rolls down behind a sloped platform and comes to rest there,
     out of sight and out of mind.

226     EXT. MAIN STREET,  EAST HOUSTON  -  DAY

     ON A NEWSMAN standing in the middle of Main Street. He looks out at US as he speaks 
earnestly into a microphone.

                    NEWSMAN
               This is East Houston, Idaho, until yesterday
               just another town that time forgot . . .

As he speaks, PULL BACK AND WIDEN TO REVEAL that he is part of a television crew
covering the story of the century. A mobile truck full of equipment is parked nearby. A 
CAMERAMAN with a minicam is shooting the report, while another TECHNICIAN watches a monitor and listens to sound on headphones.

                    NEWSMAN
               Today the population --  exaggerated reports
               put it a 123 --  has increased by three. And these
               new arrivals bringing death and destruction in 
their wake, have put East Houston back on the
map. Indeed --

227     Suddenly Non charges INTO FRAM. He looks at the truck, the mincam, and the nervous 
     newsman like wonderful new toys -- he's not sure which to break first. But Zod is right
beside him. And Zod is looking at the monitor . . . and seeing himself. As Non picks up the monitor, about to hurl it to the ground.

                    ZOD
               Stop!

                                                  CONTINUED


227     CONTINUED

With a growl of disappointment, Non sets the monitor back down again. Zod stared at his media image thoughtfully.

                    ZOD
                      (sharply)
               Who else is seeing this?

                    NEWSMAN
                     (sweating)
               Well, with this live coverage -- and of course,
               with the satellite -- I guess just about, the 
               whole world must be watching -- 

                    ZOD
               The whole world? Zentar? The Vlar 18
Galaxy?

     NEWSMAN
Earth. I meant . . . Earth.

     ZOD
     (pleased)
Good. You may continue.

228     L.S. of jeep arriving.

229     Ursa comes over, looking decidedly unfriendly.

                         NEWSMAN
                         (backing away from her
                               a bit toward the relative
                           safety of his mobile truck,
                           Still broadcasting)
                    We shall indeed continue bringing you this
                    extraordinary story as it unfolds here in the 
                    little town of --

                         URSA
                          (petulantly to Zod)
                    Enough of this man! If the whole world is
                    watching, can we not show them something
                    more interesting?





230     EXT. MAIN STREET  -  DAY

     The major picks up a bullhorn and stands up in the jeep.

                         MAJOR
                         (through bullhorn)
                    Now hear this! Now hear this! Throw
                    down your weapons -- if you have any
                    weapons -- and surrender yourselves
                    immediately. This is an order!

231     ON THE THREE VILLAINS -- Standing near the television crew.

     At the command, "This is an order," Zod looks very irritated.

                         URSA
                         (regally)
                    General Zod does not take orders. He
                    gives them.

     As a demonstration, Zod turns with a fierce scowl. He is about to employ hi Heat-Vision 
     when he sees Non standing beside him, looking rather pleadingly at him.

                         ZOD
                          (to Non, giving
                              his big break)
Very well. You try it.

     FAVORING NON -- He strikes a pose of great concentration (for him) and opens his eyes 
     wide. A moment later:

232     EFFECTS: A beam of Heat-Vision shoots from his eyes and strikes the front tires of the 
     oncoming jeep.

233     The tires go up in a burst of flames, causing the jeep to roll over and crash into the side of 
     one of the buildings. It comes hurtling out of the other side of the building and lands on a car
     lot full of parked cars.

234     Instantly, the two troop trucks screech to a halt and the soldiers leap from their places, 
     already firing at the three as they take cover all over the street.

     IN QUICK CUTS

235     1.     The townspeople run for cover. A few are caught in the firing and fall to the ground.

236     2.     The soldiers fire round after round.

237     3.     The bullets have no effect on Zod, Ursa and Non, who stand watching all this like
          spectators at a fireworks display.
238     ON THE NEWS BROADCASTER

                         NEWSMAN
                         (to his camera)
                    They're right in the line of fire and nothing
                    happens to them! I haven't seen anything
                    like this since Superman.

239     REVERSE - Coming down the other end of Main Street is a COMMANDO UNIT - ten
      Green Berets. Their LEADER carries a flame thrower.

240     WIDE ANGLE--As the TV cameraman shoots from a dangerously exposed position, the 
Commando Leader points his weapon at Zod and literally opens fire, shooting a solid bolt 
of flame at the General.

241     CLOSE ON ZOD - he blows

242     WIDE ANGLE--As the crowd screams, Zod becomes a living flame thrower, blowing
 flames at the entire  Commando Unit.

Behind them, the wooden bar catches on fire and begins to go up in flames.

243     INT. MIDWESTERN LIVING ROOM - DAY

A GUY is coming in from the kitchen carrying a beer, as we SEE T.V.  a football game in progress:

ANNOUNCER
Third and four on  Minnesota' s 25, and the question

Suddenly the News Announcer comes on:

IMAGE of the destruction in East Houston comes on screen.

ON THE GUY - furious.

244     INT. JAPANESE  LIVING ROOM  - DAY

A typical modern day small Tokyo apartment. A Japanese father and daughter are watching the horrors of East Houston on their Sony, while Mama is more intent on preparing dinner. She has a fish in front of her the chopping block and she punctuates every disapproving word with a sharp down stroke of her gleaming cleaver.

                    JAPANESE MOTHER 
I -- am -- so -- tired -- of -- all -- this
violence -- on -- television.
        (indicating daughter)
She -- should -- not -- watch -- this!
     
The fish is now just a lot of tiny pieces. She tosses down her cleaver and firmly twists the dial to another channel. 

                    DAUGHTER
                     (she was enjoying it)
               Ah, Mama, no!

245     INT. OVAL OFFICE, WHITE HOUSE  - DAY

SEEN FROM BEHIND THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, HIS SECRETARY OF STATE, A COUPLE OF GENERALS AND A BEVY OF AIDES regard the destruction on their television screen (probably one of those big Advent jobs) with dismay.

                    A YOUNG AIDE
                     (turns to President)
               Mr. President . . . sir . . . can't we --

                         THE PRESIDENT
                            (firmly, grimly)
                    No, Harrison, I don't think anyone can 
                    anymore . . . unless . . . 

                         YOUNG AIDE
                             (saying what is on
                               all their minds)
                    Where's Superman? Where is he?
                              (desperately)
                    Why doesn't he do something?

246     INT. FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE  -  NIGHT

     TIGHT TWO SHOT -  Superman and Lois, their faces filling THE SCREEN as they look 
into each other's eyes.
                                                                      SUPERMAN
                          (nervously)
                    I never did this before . . . I have to 
                    tell you.

                         LOIS
                           (Smiling up at
                              him; softly)
                    Hey, don't worry. You'll be fine, Just . . .
                    well, don't rush it.

     CAMERA WIDENS, PANS:  And there, a short distance away, is a soufflé dish.

247     EFFECTS:  Superman beams his Heat-Vision at it. It rises almost instantly, perfectly.

248     FAVORING LOIS -- watching in amazement. The Super-Soufflé mounts higher and higher.

                         LOIS
                    Stop!
                         (adoringly, as he does)
                       Never overcook a soufflé. You'll learn.

     She picks up the Champaign bottle and , doing her part, strains to push the cork out. Lightly, 
gallantly, he takes the bottle from her and looks at the cork. It pops out, then bubbly spilling      over in classic style.

                    SUPERMAN
               I though we might abandon the Orange
               juice for once.

As her eyes shine, as they lean to each other.

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

249     INT. FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE  -  NIGHT

     MED. CLOSE SHOT  -  Dinner is over, the lights are low. The magnificent flowers have 
been moved to one side.

                                                  CONTINUED




249     CONTINUED

We can tell from their manner that they have been talking seriously for some time.

                    LOIS
               It must be tough, having to be Clark
               Kent.

                         SUPERMAN
                    Oh no.
                         (very honestly)
                    I really like it sometimes.
                         (smiles)
                    And if it weren't for him, I wouldn't 
                    have met you.

                         LOIS
                    But him is you.
                          (laughing)
                    Now I'm confused.

     She rises, still holding his hand, smiling down at him.

                         LOIS
                    Tell you what, you just keep thinking
                    about that while I . . . 
                           (not really kidding)
                    . . . slip into something more comfortable.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

250     INT. ANOTHER AREA OF THE FORTRESS  -  NIGHT

BEGIN TIGHT ON LOIS' HANDBAG as she opens it. PULL BACK GRADUALLY as she, like a magician drawing scarves out of a hat, pulls something long and beautifully 
filmy, which she had the foresight to bring along. PULLBACK ENDS IN FULL SHOT as 
she holds this gorgeous peignoir up in front of her and smiles to herself, her eyes shining
with anticipation.











251     INT. MEMEORY CRYSTAL BANK AREA, FORTRESS  -  NIGHT

     As a troubled Superman sits on a platform near the Crystal Bank, looking up at the image of 
Lara that floats in the fastness of the Fortress.

                    LARA
                    (nodding slowly,
                      feeling for him)
               Kal-El, your father and I . . . we have 
               tried to anticipate your every question.
                   (dismayed)
               This is the one we hoped you would 
not ask.

252     ON LOIS --  Emerging in her peignoir, radiantly ready for a night of love. She is startled to hear:

                         SUPERMAN (o.s.)
                    But Mother, I have to ask. because I have to
                    have her.
                             (realizing it as
                              he says it:)
                    She's all I want in life.

     ON LOIS - Thrilled to hear this, but confused and curious. TRACK WITH HER as she hurries towards the source of the voices, out onto an interior balcony.

253     WIDE, LONG SHOT: Losi stands on the balcony at the rear of the great central chamber. She makes no attempt to hide as she observes this amazing encounter between Superman
     and the floating image of Lara.

                         LARA
                         (gentle, infinite reproach)
                    You no longer can serve humanity if you
                    invest your time and emotion in one of them 
at the expense of the rest.
                         (tellingly, but in mild tones)
                    Surely this is not how you repay their gratitude, 
Kal-El. Could you really abandon the weak and 
the needy merely to fulfill some selfish dream.

                         SUPERMAN
                            (stung)
                    Selfish! But they get a chance at happiness.
                    Can't I have that chance?

                                                       CONTINUED


253     CONTINUED

     QUICK C.U. LOIS - as stricken as Superman.

                         LARA
                    You have been given a higher form of happiness.
                    The happiness you feel by serving others, by
                    inspiring them to --

                         SUPERMAN
                         (tortured)
                    Yes, but it's not all I feel.

                         LARA
                          (reprovingly)
                    Patience, Kal-El. You begin to sound like
                    an Earthling.
                                                                                SUPERMAN
                    Mother, you speak only of honor, of
                    sacrifice, of responsibility --

                         LARA
                    Because that is your heritage. Those are the 
                    values we lived by on Krypton.

     NEW ANGLE

                         SUPERMAN
                          (intensely)
                    But you had more than that, and I know it.
                    You and my father --  you had each other.
                          (a last, quiet plea)
                    Can I never have what you had?

     LARA is silent, deeply moved. Finally, slowly:

                         LARA
                         (half-convinced)
                    And she -- the one you have chosen --
               she feels as much for you?

                    SUPERMAN
               Yes.

                                                  CONTINUED



253     CONTINUED

                    LARA
                    (taking a deep breath,
                      making a painful decision)
               Then if this is what you wish -- to live your
               life with a mortal - then you can only live
               as a mortal. You must become . . . on of them.

254     The rounded section of a polarized glass, which had always seemed like an integral 
part of the Fortress now suddenly starts to rise. Now we SEE that it is, in fact, a circular chamber.

                    LARA
               This crystal chamber has harnessed the rays
               of the red sun of Krypton. Once exposed to 
               these rays, all your great powers on Earth will
               disappear forever.

The crystal chamber comes to a stop and slowly opens before him. Superman stares at it in wonder.

225     QUICK C.U. LOIS - watching, paralyzed.

256     WIDE TWO SHOT - KARA AND SUPERMAN

                         LARA
                    But consider. Once it is done, there is
                    no return. You will feel like an ordinary
                    man.
                          (a mother's anguish)
                    You can be hurt like an ordinary man . . . 

     Superman steps slowly, deliberately towards the chamber.

                         LARA
                       (suddenly)
                    Oh my son, are you sure?

     CLOSER ON SUPERMAN - as he looks at Lara, the tension showing on his face. Finally, 
simply:

                    SUPERMAN
               Mother, I love her.

His  mind made up, he turns and strides into the chamber.



257     EXT. MAIN STREET, EAST HOUSTON  -  DAY

     WIDE SHOT --  The three villains deployed at various places along the street, masters of all      they survey. All around them are the signs of havoc they have wreaked: the bodies, the 
smoldering houses, the overturned trucks, etc.

258     ON A ROOF - A SOLDIER hefting a bazooka runs on the roof, ducking down to keep 
hidden. He finds a vantage point, then rises and takes aim at NON in the street below.

259     POV: GUN SIGHT, BAZOOKA - NON right on the crosshairs.

260     ON THE SOLDIER - He fires.

261     ON NON - He reaches up with one great hand and catches the bazooka shell bare-handed. 
     The, amazingly, he simply crushes it. It crumbles into pebble-like fragments as he opens
     his palm and lets it drop,

262     ANGLE UP: An Army helicopter suddenly looms up over the horizon and swoops down on the street, fires three rockets on Zod, who does not flinch.

263     CLOSER ON IT: As the PILOT brings it down, a SHARPSHOOTER seated beside him trains an automatic on Zod.

264     ON ZOD AND URSA

                         URSA
                         (patronizingly)
                    Look, they need a machine to fly.

                         ZOD
                          (sarcastically)
                    Brave young heroes. Be nice to them, my dear.
                    Blow them a kiss.

     C.U. URSA - She lifts her face up to the sky and puckers up for an obscenely exaggerated kiss. Her lips part.

     EFFECT:  (WIDE ANGLE)  As she blows, ever so softly, the current of air streaks up and hits the rotary blades with Super-Breath.

265     They spin like a pinwheel. Shaking, the chopper goes crazily out of control. As Ursa continues to blow, the blades snap off. The helicopter crashes to the ground, black smoke billowing up into the sky.

     Suddenly all is still. The last challenge has been met and bested.




266     FAVORING ZOD - who looks around him in triumph.

                         ZOD
                    I win!
                         (pause; less triumphant)
                    I always win.
                              (almost disappointed)
                    There is no one on this planet who can
                    even challenge me.

     He whirls toward the terrified TV crew, still shooting, and pulls the camera toward his face.

267     POV: DISTORTED FACE OF ZOD SEEN THROUGH TV LENSE.

                         ZOD
                       (savagely)
                    Have I shown you enough?! or must the 
                    blood run in all your streets . . . !

268     INT. MOLECULAR RESTRUCTERING CHAMBER

Inside the chamber, Superman passes his hand across various crystals to activate the restructuring mechanisms. Then, he waits, closing his eyes.

269     EFFECTS: Violent light changes begin, spectacular lazer-like rays bouncing off the crystalline walls and playing over Superman like the red Krypton sun. As the walls glow a deeper and deeper blood-red.

                                                       CUT TO:

270     INT. FORTRESS, OUTSIDE MOLECULAR RESTRUCTERING CHAMBER - NIGHT

     The Memory Crystal Bank glows like the glass of the chamber, like fire, and suddenly explodes. Lara's grieving image fades and disappears in the black smoke that billows up from the ruins.

271     ON LOIS - Terrified, she turns away and hides her face in her hands.

272     INT. MOLECULAR RESTRUCTERING CHAMBER - NIGHT

     As the lights play wildly over Superman, the fiery walls of the chamber begin to darken as if they were burnt out. A final burst of light, a final current of Kryptonian energy seems to pass through Superman's body. He has always been invulnerable; now this force makes him shudder suddenly, terribly





273     EFFECTS: Suddenly, before our eyes, an image of the mortal Clark Kent appears. The two "selves" separate, the life force animating Clark who moves away from the slab and toward the exit of the chamber. The Superman figure is completely still.

     As Clark Kent becomes a brighter, more solid and substantial image, the Superman "figure" grows pale and insubstantial, fading, losing definition, and becoming opaque. Finally, it simply vanishes.

     The lazer lights have all gone out and the chamber glass has turned a deadly green-black. There is absolute silence.

274     INT. FORTRESS, OUTSIDE MOLECULAR RESTRUCTERING CHAMBER - NIGHT

     Clark comes slowly to a stunned Lois Lane. He wears a white shirt, slacks, but no glasses or corny hairstyle. This is somehow a more mature and manly Clark now.

                         LOIS
                    You did it. You gave it all up for me.
                    I . . . I don't know what to say.

                         CLARK
                    Say you love me.

     He puts his arm around her as she stands pale and wide-eyed in her lovely peignoir. She slips her arm around him and lays her head on his shoulder.

     HOLD CAMERA STATIONARY as, silently, SEEN FROM BEHIND, they disappear, holding each other close, into another, more romantic part of the Fortress.

275     EXT. MAIN STREET, EAST HOUSTON  -  DAY

ON A FIVE-STAR GENERAL, standing tall, chin up, face reddened with surpressed rage and humiliation.

     TIGHT INSERT - Zod's hand rips off the epaulet of five gold stars.

     Contemptuously, he hurls them into the dirt.

                         ZOD
                         (scornfully)
                    And you are a General?
                         (considers it, then:)
                    Who is your superior?

                                                       CONTINUED




275     CONTINUED

     FULL SHOT - General Zod and the American General stand in front of a veritable tableau of death and disaster.

                         GENERAL
                           (stiffly)
                    I only answer to the President.

                         ZOD
                          (meaningfully)
                    Then he will answer to me. Or all of his cities
                    will end like this one . . . 

276     INT.  FORTRESS SLEEPING CHAMBER  - DAY

     TIGHT ON CLARK AND LOIS - laying quietly in the classic afterglow position. She looks     blissfully content. He, in the cold light of morning is troubled. And then (being a mere
mortal) he shivers. She snuggles closer. Suddenly their Eden is lost, She lays still in his arms.
but now we see in her eyes too the realization of how much he has sacrificed.

277     INT. WHITE HOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY

Helmeted MARINES in full combat gear help WHITE HOUSE POLICE and SECRET SERVICE AGENTS secure the corridor leading to the Oval Office. An explosive charge is attached to the door at the entrance to the corridor, the connecting wires trailing off to a plunger detonator behind a nest of sandbags with a machine-gun emplacement. The MARINES take their positions, all eyes on the door, as suddenly: ZOD, NON and URSA burst down through the ceiling, shattering three glass domes which comprise part of it. The MARINES, POLICE, and SECRET SERVICE open fire through the shower of falling glass, send a withering barrage ricocheting around the room. ZOD watches triumphantly, the bullets bouncing harmlessly off him as URSA and NON go to work: URSA flings the advancing MARINES through the air, sends them crashing into one another as NON smashes the corridor pillars, then turns his attention to the machine-gun nest which blazes away at him. He demolishes the emplacement, breaks the gun in two, roars. 













278     INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY

     CAMERA LOOKS from behind the PRESIDENT'S desk chair in the Oval Office at the 
closed and bolted entrance door. Half a dozen telephones ring with different buzzers and bells, but are not a answered. To one side, a dozen CHIEFS OF STAFF, CABINET 
MEMBERS, SECRET SERVICE AGENTS, et. al. stand waiting as the last sounds of 
gunfire die away in the corridor.  There is a  moment of silence, punctuated only by the 
sound of the unanswered phones. Suddenly: the door to the Oval Office collapses, 
kicked to the floor in one piece. Standing in the open doorway, the devastated corridor 
seen behind them: ZOD, URSA and NON.

ZOD and URSA enter. NON fills the doorway, standing guard. URSA now wears not only the NASA buckle, but the Texas Ranger badge as well. ZOD glances at the silent OFFICIALS with contempt, then turns his attention to the distinguished-looking MAN sitting behind the President's desk.

VILLAINS IN WHITE HOUSE          Sc. Nos.  446-451

                         ZOD
                    You are the one who is called 
                    President . . .

                         MAN
                    I am.

                         ZOD
                    I see you are practiced in worshipping things that 
fly. Good. Rise before Zod. Now, kneel before

279     EXT CANADA  -  ROAD - NIGHT

     A rented car speeds quickly down a northern Canadian highway.

280     EXT. DINER - NIGHT

CLARK pulls the car off the highway into the parking area of a seedy-looking diner with a neon hot dog flashing on and off in front and the sign: DON'S BIG SLED DOGS. Several trucks are parked in the lot as well.

     INT. DINER - NIGHT

     CLARK and LOIS enter. A TV plays noisily in B.G.. The counter is almost empty.

                         CLARK
                              (to Lois)
                    I'm going to wash up. Grab us a couple of 
seats there.

     CLARK exits. LOIS crosses, sits on the end stool. She picks up a menu, studies it, as a 
huge, burly TRUCKER enters, spots her, intentionally sits next to her, cutting LOIS off 
from the rest of the counter.

                         LOIS
                    I'm sorry, that seat's taken.

                    Excuse me. That's my seat.

     The TRUCKER looks over at the Men's Room, then back at CLARK.

                         TRUCKER
                    You've just been sittin' on your seat, four-eyes.

                         CLARK
                               (pause - tense)
                    I think maybe somebody ought to teach you
 some      manners.

                         TRUCKER
                    Yeah? Well you let me know when he comes in.

                         LOIS

                    Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?

     The Trucker rises. He's big. He pauses a moment.

                         TRUCKER
                    I don't mind . . .

     The Trucker uncoils a tremendous right hand.
               
EXT. DINER - DAY

     CLARK goes flying through a plate glass door, shattering it, lands in a heap on the 
ground. The TRUCKER is already on him. CLARK tries to get up, is immediately knocked down again. LOIS      rushes through the doorway to help, but is unceremoniously flung off to the side. Feeling new rage,      CLARK rises, rushes the TRUCKER, actually gets in a punch or two, but is cut to pieces by a      series of expert combinations. CLARK falls to the ground, exhausted, his face cracked and      bleeding, feebly tries to get up once more.

buddy?

     The TRUCKER kicks CLARK in the ribs - he collapses. With a sneer at LOIS, the 
TRUCKER heads off for his rig. LOIS rises, her eyes filling with tears, tries to help CLARK up.

                         LOIS
                    Oh, Clark . . . Clark . . . look at you . . .

CLARK tries to smile feebly through the blood, deeply embarrassed, bitter.  A trickle of blood runs over his mouth. He wipes it away with a finger, inadvertently tasting it, stares at the stain on his hands.

                         CLARK
                               (stunned)

     She helps him to his feet. He stands unsteadily, looks at her, ashamed.

                         CLARK
                             (bitter)
                    Maybe we ought to hire 
                    a bodyguard from now on.

                         LOIS
                          (deeply felt)
                    I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell 
                    in love with.

                         CLARK
                    I know that, Lois. And I wish he were here . . .

     CLARK turns, staggers in the direction of the diner. LOIS puts her arm around him, 
helps him inside.

     LOIS helps CLARK back to the counter, starts to clean his face, dipping paper napkins 
in a water glass.
                         
                         LOIS
                    Boy, what a mess . . .

Suddenly - the loud television cuts off: After momentary static, a somber VOICE is heard.

                         TV VOICE
                    Ladies and gentlemen - the President of the 
                    United States.

     CLARK, LOIS and the COUNTERMAN turn, listen.

     ANGLE ON TV SCREEN

The worried PRESIDENT sits behind his desk, reads from a prepared statement, the paper trembling in his hands.

                         PRESIDENT
                    This is the President. On behalf of my country, 
                    and in the name of the other leaders of the world 
                    with whom I have today consulted, I hereby 
                    abdicate all authority and control over this planet . . . 
                    to General Zod.

     ANGLE ON CLARK AND LOIS
     
     CLARK and LOIS sit watching, frozen in disbelief.

     BACK TO TV SCREEN

                         PRESIDENT'S VOICE
                    Only through strict compliance with his directions 
will the lives of innocent millions be . . .

                    Superman, if you can hear me . . . Superman, where . . .

     There is a "squawk" as the mike is taken from him. ZOD comes on screen, sneers at the      PRESIDENT.

Come! Come, and kneel before Zod!

     The TV goes dead. CLARK is stunned.

                    General Zod . . . here . . .

     CLARK shuts his eyes, deeply troubled. LOIS looks up at him tenderly, cups his      bruised cheek with her hand.

                         LOIS
                    Don't . . . it's not your fault . . . you

                    He knew. I heard him. I just didn't listen.

281     EXT. NORTHERN HIGHWAY - DAY

The branches are bare, the sky cold and bleak. Clark, his face still bruised and cut, has obviously been standing at the side of the road for a long time. 
     
     CLOSER -- As he shivers in his light clothing:

     SOUND: a truck, not far off.

     Desperately hopeful, Clark straightens up and puts his thumb out. With a great roar, the 
truck speeds ACROSS FRAME and disappears, leaving Clark standing there, looking after
it in the gray silence.

282     EXT. ARCTIC FIELD - TWILIGHT

There are no roads this far north. Clark doggedly, numbly, treks across the frozen landscape.
     
     CLOSER --  He almost stumbles and then , as he catches his breath stops. He bends, scoops 
up a handful of snow and applies it gently to his bruised cheek. He stares off into the endless distance he still has to go.

283     INT. FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE  -  NIGHT

     The Fortress that once glittered magically now appears cold and desolate. The ruins of the 
Memory Crystal Bank still smoulders in f.g. As the deathly silence is broken by a slight noise, CAMERA  PANS and Clark comes INTO FRAME.

Somehow, at last, he is here. But he is exhausted and, as he looks all around him, without any real hope. He stands upright.

               I've failed.
         (ashamed and defeated)
I thought only of myself and I . . ... I even failed
myself.
         (anguished, barely able 
           to say it)
I failed everyone . . ..

     He steps to the Memory Crystal Bank, picks up a couple of the now-useless crystals in his 
hand and looks at them as if they were only     archeological relics. Finally he lets them fall, 
the fragments tingling in the vast, cavernous stillness as the drop and shatter into even smaller pieces

Clark stands motionless through another beat of absolute silence. Then, suddenly, he raises 
his head.

                         CLARK
                         (a cry of profound, total 
                           despair)
                    Father!! Mother!!  Can't you help me? Can't
anybody help me??

As his cry echoes and fades, there is only stillness. Accepting his fate, feeling abandoned, he 
bows his head.

Then . . . . . .

Sound: a faint pulsing sound, growing louder the longer it continuous.

ON CLARK - By degrees, he becomes aware of it. he looks up. Suddenly, on his face,
a green light begins to beam its reflection.

His eyes widen, as he begins to feel the pull of a long forgotten power .

     WIDE ANGLE -- He walks toward the source of the pulsating green light, almost      as if in     a 
trance. He is being pulled toward it as if by invisible forces.









284     ON THE CRYSTAL SLAB where Lois earlier let fall the Green Crystal:  from behind it, the      power of the Crystal makes itself known. It glows and shines with an intensity seemingly far      beyond its size, compelling Clark to come closer.

The effect is exactly like that     moment in Superman, Part I (RELEASE SCRIPT, REEL FOUR - Page 6) when young Clark discovered it in the Kansas barn.

There is an awesome, even religious, feeling to all of this. He sinks on his knees beside and  tentatively, very tentatively reaches for the Green Crystal.

He holds onto it now as if it were a lifeline, raising  it before his eyes and staring into it.

The Crystal begins to glow and pulsate with an even greater intensity, transmitting its unearthly energy and power to Clark. Its radiance is reflected upon his face. He trembles as the Kryptonian force passes through him.

287     INT. PERRY WHITE'S OFFICE, DAILY PLANET - NIGHT

     (NOTE: All ANGELS are facing street windows, so as to avoid rebuilding City Room offices      behind glass partitions.)

     An agitated Perry White paces back and forth, watching Jimmy Olsen and Lois - the latter 
even more fearful than she lets on.

PERRY
                    I can't understand it! Where is he? I mean, he shows 
up every time a cat gets stuck in a tree, and  now he 
decides to pull a disappearing act?

     JIMMY
Maybe we just don' t know his game plan.

     PERRY
Game plan! It's fourth down and long yardage, the 
two-minute warning sounded and the ball's deep
in our territory! How brilliant do you have to be?!

     JIMMY
                                                 (the hero worshipper)
                    Superman's got something up his sleeve, that's for 
sure. We just haven't figured it out. Isn't that right, 
Miss Lane?

     ON LOIS-her eyes betray that spunky assurance she tries to portray, for her last look at     Superman was a beaten, bloody Clark Kent. Furthermore, she has no knowledge of what has 
happened to him since he left her to return to the Fortress and no real expectation that he 
will ever return in his Superman role.

                     (pause)
               If there's any way at all . . .

                    JIMMY
               See? And she knows him better than anybody .

C.U. LOIS -- a small ironic smile touched with sadness.

                         LOIS
                    Yes...better than anybody.

     (AT THIS POINT THE VILLAINS ENTER THE OFFICES)

288     ANGLE THROUGH PERRY'S INSIDE WINDOW

The wall of the city room collapses in the center as the VILLAINS break straight through it. The terrified REPORTERS scatter, rushing through the exit doors in panic as ZOD, URSA, and NON head for PERRY'S office.

     ANGLE ON DOOR

NON is the first through, knocking down the door. PERRY hurls a huge electric typewriter at him, which bounces harmlessly off his head. NON slams him back against the wall. PERRY crumples in a heap. JIMMY flashes a picture as LOIS picks up a sharp letter opener, swings it viciously into URSA'S stomach. It folds up like tissue paper. URSA sends LOIS flying backward into PERRY'S rolling desk chair. JIMMY flashes another picture - 

                         ZOD
                           (from doorway)
                                 Enough!

ZOD stands in the doorway, looks questioningly at the group. He glances back at the hole in the City Room wall as CAMERA PANS: LUTHOR steps through the hole delicately, flicking the occasional debris off his shoulder.

289     EXT STREET CORNER, METROPOLIS - NIGHT
     
     CLOSE ON a stack of Daily Planet. newspapers, piled in front of a street-corner newsstand.
 A headline in enormous banner type reads: WHITE HOUSE SURRENDERS.

     Suddenly, the top paper in the      stack begins to flutter, as if from a sudden breeze. Then
     the pages beneath begin to ripple and flap, as the gust of wind grows stronger 

     Now, as the sound of a great rush of wind heard, the entire stack of newspapers begin to fly
     in the wind.

     The NEWSDEALER runs Out to grab his papers.

                         NEWSDEALER
                    What the hell ---- !

     He looks up.

290     We SEE a blue flash zooming through the night sky.

     MUSIC:  the theme confirms our suspicions.

291     It's Superman flying again. He dives for the Daily Planet building and lands on a flagpole that extends horizontally just outside Perry White's office.





292     INT. PERRY WHITE'S OFFICE  -  NIGHT

(NOTE: At this point, we go to shot No. 470 as written and previously shot, in which Superman challenges the three villains to a fight. They fly out the window in pursuit of him.

     Suddenly: a clear, stentorian VOICE is heard, O.S.

                         SUPERMAN'S VOICE
                    Haven't you ever heard of Freedom of the                                    Press, General?

CAMERA WHIP PANS - SUPERMAN stands on the tip of flagpole right outside PERRY'S window. He stares in, arms folded, the American flag billowing underneath.

     BACK TO SCENE

     The VILLAINS are thunderstruck, rooted to the spot. LOIS rises unbelievingly.

                         LOIS
                               Superman . . .

                            LUTHOR
                           Thank God . . .
                             (to Villains)
                             I mean . . . get him!

     SUPERMAN disappears, flying up and out of frame.

                         ZOD
                               (insane)
                    Come to me, Son of Jor-El! Kneel 
                    before Zod!

293     The VILLAINS move as one, smashing through both the wall and windows after him, 
completely demolishing the street side of the room.

294     ON SUPERMAN -- He stands on a high ledge of building, waiting for them.


295     WIDE ANGLE -- As Non and Ursa hover in the sky like evil angels.









296     Zod lands on an exposed steel girder of a partially constructed skyscraper across the street. 
Hanging a few feet above him, from a crane, is a massive concrete block, tied to a thick steel 
chain which hangs from an iron hook.

Zod is about thirty feet higher than Superman.  He strikes an appropriately authoritarian pose 
and points down at him.

                    ZOD 
                (stentorian tones) 
Son of Jor-El! Kneel before Zod!

     At the sound of the hated name, Non roars.

                         ZOD
                    When you did not come, we took you for 
a coward!

297     MED C.U. SUPERMAN - looking up at him.

                         SUPERMAN
                    I'm no coward, General Zod.

298     ON ZOD

                         ZOD
                    Perhaps not. Perhaps you are only .. fool.
                         (with a malicious smile)
Like your father.

299     C. U. SUPERMAN - his jaw tightens. The insult to his father has its effect.

ZOD
                    Kneel, Son of Jor-El! Bow to me and atone for the 
sin of your father!

SUPERMAN 
                                    (looking up at him)
                    I can't bow to someone so far beneath me.

300     ON ZOD -- made furious by the insult. His eyes glowing fiercely, he looks up at the concrete 
beam dangling  a few feet above him.

301     EFFECTS: He beams a ray of  Heat-Vision at the metal chain. It burns through swiftly and 
the block drops in Zod's waiting hands. He catches it easily,     as if it were light as a feather.

                    ZOD
               Then die as you deserve to!

     H raises the block high and flings it down at Superman.

302     NEW ANGLE - EFFECTS:  Superman aims Lazer-vision at on-coming concrete 
slab, and it pulverizes in mid-air, turning to harmless powder.

303     FOLLOW THE POWDERY STUFF as it drops to the street .

304     ON THE STREET -- A CROWD is beginning to form, looking up. As the dust falls, a 
yellow cab comes around the corner and receives most of the harmless debris on its 
windshield. The cab brakes to a screeching halt.

The CABBIE looks up with the expectant grin of a fight fan at a championship match.

                    CABBIE
               Man, this is gonna be good!

He switches on his on OFF-DUTY sign for the duration.

305     ON URSA - Upset by the humiliation on her leader . She hisses angrily at Superman.

                         URSA
                    How dare you defy the General?

                         SUPERMAN
                    It's easy.

306     FAVORING ZOD --  reacting to the arrogance, he snaps his  fingers at the faithful Non.

ZOD
Take him. He is yours.

307     Let off his leash, so to speak, Non leaps into action and flies toward Superman .

308     WIDE ANGLE --  Superman leaves his perch as well. The two begin to circle each other 
warily in the air, like two fighter planes getting into position for a dog-fight, or two     knife fighters jockeying for the first advantage.

309     ON ZOD - growing impatient with the delay.

ZOD
Kill him!  Kill him!

310     Thee command triggers Non into action. He zooms forward and punches Superman with all     his murderous might.

311     The blow sends Superman reeling backward at great speed.




312     C.U. as he comes to rest on a ledge of a building. He is rather shaken, and rather surprised to 
be.

                         SUPERMAN
                          (wonderingly as he gets 
        himself together)
This is going to be harder than I thought . . . 

313     ON THE WINDOWS OF PERRY WHITE'S OFFICE --where the employees, especially 
Lois, are watching anxiously.

                    JIMMY
               Man! That big guy is just as strong as Superman!

Lois looks worriedly at Jimmy. Perry leans out the window, calling like a coach from the 
sidelines:

PERRY
Come on, Superman - straighten up and fly 
right!

314     WIDE ANGLE --  Superman comes charging through the air directly at Non. He whips his foot up like a champion Karate fighter and deals Non a powerful kick in the jaw. As Non, with a grunt, goes tumbling OUT OF FRAME:

315     ON THE STREET BELOW -- The crowd cheers their hero.

                         A GUY IN CROWD
Way to go Superman!

316     ON SUPERMAN - looking in the direction of Non's flight off.

317     Suddenly, Ursa flies up behind him, twists his hair in her hands and pulls it, viciously, with 
all her might.

                    SUPERMAN
                     (in much pain, doesn't see who 
                         it is behind him pulling his hair)
               Why don't you fight like a man?

                    URSA
Why ever should I?

     He breaks free of her, whirls around, fist cocked for a killer punch. But then he hesitates.

                                                  CONTINUED



317     CONTINUED

                         URSA
                           (mockingly)
                    Superman! You?? Hit a woman??

     She's got his number, that nice kid raised by Jonathan and Martha Kent. As he refrains from
belting her for one all-important second.

318     NON swoops back INTO FRAME behind Superman and grabs him around the waist in a 
bear hug.

NEW ANGLE -- As Non squeezes tighter and tighter while a greatly pained Superman 
struggles to free himself.

319     Ursa flies to the side of the nearest building and snaps off a flagpole that protrudes horizontally from the third floor ledge. It's one of those flagpoles with a golf ball on the end of it.

320     She flies toward them and raises the flagpole, about to swing it like a baseball bat.


321     

ZOD
                            (calling from his position 
                               of relative safety) 
smash him! Smash his head open!

322     Ursa winds up and starts to swing. As she does, Superman manages to extricate himself from 
Non's grip, squeezing out and slipping away. Too late to check her swing, though

323     The golden bowl connects with the thick chest of Non with a tremendous crack.

324     ON THE GROUND

                         THE CABBIE
          (ecstatic)
Home run !

325     ON THE BATTLERS -- The terrific impact of Ursa's blow sends Non reeling backward at 
an incredible speed. Tumbling end over end, he smashes into the top section of the Empire      State Building in b.g.

326     As he hits the television antenna it breaks off. Showers of electrical sparks go spiraling into 
the air as the antenna breaks off and falls toward the street.

     Sound:  off Screen, OUT OF FRAME, the screams of the people below. Then the sirens     of     approaching ambulances and police cars.
327     ON THE STREET -- We SEE an ambulance racing toward the area. 

328     ON SUPERMAN -- Suddenly horrified as he SEES the antenna falling.

329     ON THE STREET - where a WOMAN pushes a baby carriage looks up, frozen to the spot,     paralyzed with terror.

330     ON SUPERMAN -- as he catches the antenna just in time. As the woman with the carriage runs to safety, he flies up again, holding the cage-like object.

331     ON ZOD AND URSA -- watching this from their vantage point on a building roof across the street.

                         ZOD
This "super" man is nothing of the kind. I have 
discovered his weakness.

     URSA
Yes?

     ZOD
        (bemused)
He...
         (searching for the bon mot) 
cares. He actually cares about these . . . . . .these People. 
These earth People .

URSA
                    Sentimental idiot.

332     ON TOP OF EMPIRE STATE BUILDING -- The still groggy Non lies on the broken summit. Superman flies up still holding the cage-like antenna and puts it over him, penning 
him in.

333     ON ZOD AND URSA - standing before a large billboard. 
     
                         URSA 
       (distraught) 
He's captured Non!

     ZOD
Don't worry. I will draw his fire.
        (small smile) 
With a few of my own.

334     ANGLE DOWN -- EFFECTS: Zod, using his beams of Heat-Vision, aims one ray after 
another at the gas tanks of the line of parked cars on the street below.


335     FROM     THIS ANGLE, WE CAN SEE DOWN THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING

     As the rays strike the tanks they glow red hot and then explode in a pillar of flame.

     One, two, three, automobiles go up like this, and  now we SEE that at the end of the street is 
a big Exxon tanker truck. Inevitably Zod will set fire to this one and the conflagration would  be devastating (not to mention the effect on the energy crisis).

336     ON SUPER.MAN -- On top of the Empire State Building, he looks down and SEES what 
Zod is up to.

                         SUPERMAN
No!
337     LONG SHOT -- He zooms down to the street at super-speed.

338     Just as Zod has finished setting fire to the last car on the block and is about to move on to the tanker truck.

339     CLOSER -- Acting quickly, Superman rips off the large mirror positioned outside the cab on the driver's side (the rear-view mirror, in other words) and twists it around so that it reflects 
the beam of Heat-Vision.

340     ANGLE TO SEE that as the beam hits the mirror instead of the tank, it is reflected back at 
Zod with a rush of flame.

341     EFFECTS: ON ZOD -- Standing before an advertising billboard. The whoosh of rushing flame completely obliterates both the General and the billboard FROM OUR SIGHT. But a moment. later we see that the sign has burnt up except for a silhouette of Zod, for where he 
stood, his fireproof self, protected that portion of the billboard from the fire.

342     NEW ANGLE -- As Superman turns towards the truck, Non has revived and launched a new 
attack. He flies down at his enemy at full Speed.

343     They connect with a sickening crunch.

The two titans crash right through the pavement.

344     As they disappear into the crater they have created, the earth trembles with the force of it
Street lamps shake, parked cars rumble. Suddenly the glass display Windows of a clothing
store vibrate and then collapses with a great smashing of glass.

     The dress mannequins in the display window pitch forward like dead bodies.

     The people rush forward in a mob to peer down into the hole, to watch the fight.

345     But, BEHIND THEM, the great form of Non comes shooting out of the street (from a new 
hole), on the receiving end of a thunderous Superman punch.


346     NEW ANGLE -- The street cracks in places, debris dropping all around. A few manhole
covers in f.g. fly up a few feet, loosened from their moorings, and drop to the gutter. 

347     FOLLOW NON -- in his unstoppable trajectory he crashes through a great glass office 
building on the fourteenth floor. A moment later he comes flying out the other side on the 
thirteenth floor as huge hunks of plate glass rain down into the street.

348     Hysterical, panicked OFFICE WORKERS on the sidewalk.

OFFICE WORKER
     (slightly hurt, very frightened)
Help! Help us Superman!

349      ON THE STREET --  Superman comes flying up out of the hole beneath the street on his 
way to help them.

350     ON URSA -- Nearby, she picks up a manhole cover, holding it like a Frisbee.

URSA
     What's your hurry, Superman? Don't
     you want to play with me?
And with that she flings the manhole cover at him in his flight. It whizzes through the air with a shrill whistling sound.

     Great shot, Ursa. The manhole cover catches Superman right in the stomach  with an 
audible thump. It not only stops his flight, it knocks him down the street, seemingly
unconscious.

351     C. U. LOIS -- watching from the window, she puts a hand to her mouth, afraid he's really 
finished.

352     C. U. ZOD -- a great smile of victory.

353     NEW ANGLE -- Zod the leaps from his perch and drops beside the still form of Superman.
     Striding over to him, he puts one foot on the fallen hero's chest pose of The Great White      Hunter with his kill.

                         ZOD
                    Now, Son of Jor-El, admit defeat. Beg forgiveness
and swear allegiance to Zod.

     But it ain't that simple, General.

                         SUPERMAN
                           (suddenly)
                    That'll be the day.

     And with that, the suddenly "revived" Superman grabs Zod by the hand and foot and flings
him up into the air, OUT OF FRAME.

354     ANGLE ON COCA-COLA SIGN -- Zod is driven back into an enormous illuminated Coca-Cola sign. Hundreds of light bulbs pop like soda bubbles. Rainbows of sparks fall to the streets below.

355     ON THE STREET -- Among the fearful crowd, SPOT some who are excited, having almost
 a good time. A STREET GANG in satin club jackets, for example, are getting off on the 
spectacle, while other people run in fear.

356     INT . PERRY WHITE' S OFFICE  -  DAILY PLANET -  NIGHT
As previously shot as SCENE 485.

PERRY, JIMMY and LOIS stand near the edge of the floor, which used to connect to the missing wall, peer out into the night sky trying to get a glimpse of what's going on. Fire and police sirens wail loudly below. From the distance we can hear the sound of "thumps" and "whacks" echoing ominously across the city, signifying that the super-fight is still continuing. LUTHOR lies back calmly, propped up against the wall. He checks his watch, mumbles.

                         LUTHOR
                                   (to himself)
                    Who would have thought this thing 
                    would go the distance . . .

357     EXT. STREET  -  NIGHT

     Ursa, smarting from the reversal to her leader, gestures to Non.

                         URSA
                    come! Do as I do!

A passenger bus has come down the street only to be stuck in place by all the chaos and
destruction going on. Ursa grabs the back bumper of the bus, begins to lift.

                    URSA
               Take the front!

     Non lifts the front bumper. Together they hold the bus full of PEOPLE aloft.


358     INT. CITY BUS  -  NIGHT

Inside the bus, terrified PASSENGERS calling for help. Many of them rush to the windows     and begin to climb out.





359     EXT. STREET  - NIGHT

FULL SHOT, CAMERA POSITIONED BEHIND URSA SO THAT WE SEE THE ENTIRE BUS ALOFT, WITH URSA AND NON BENEQATH, AND HAPLESS PASSENGERS WHO TRIED TO CLIMB OUT NOW DANGLING  FROM THE WINDOWS, afraid to jump.

360     C.U. URSA --  looking at these people hanging on the sides. Their pleas have no effect 
on her.

361     ON SUPERMAN -- from above, horrified as he sees what they are about to do.

                         SUPERMAN
                    No! Don't do it! The people!

362     ON URSA, NEW ANGLE -- With a few breaths of Super-Breath she blows the dangling 
passengers off the bus.

363     They drop to the street, hurt or unconscious

364     FAVORING SUPERMAN -- AS he flies down to stop anymore of this. Behind him is a wall 
of bricks -- the side of a building.

365     L.S. ZOD zooms down canyon and shouts:

                         ZOD
                          (from above, commanding; )
Yes! Throw it!
366     Ursa and Non hurl the bus forward, directly at Superman.

367     NEW ANGL.E -- The bus flies right at him and hits     him squarely. Although he tries to absorb as much of the impact as possible, the force of this enormous object pushes him back 
against the wall, momentarily pinned there.

368     Inside the bus, the remaining passenger cry for help. 

369     As Superman struggles to get himself free and help the people --

370     WHIP PAN to the three villains as they group at the end of the street.

371     LONG SHOT, ANGLED TO SEE entire street, with villains in f. g.

                         ZOD
      (manic, wild)
Bow and proclaim Zod your master!




372     POV DOWN, SEEING SUPERMAN -- as he frees himself.

                         SUPERMAN
                    That's a lot of hot air.

373                         ZOD
                    Hot air!  I'll show you hot air!

The three villains together blow a tremendous gust of Super-Breath down the street.

374     EFFECTS -- It's  a hurricane force wind. wreaking incredible damage. Before the mighty, 
relentless gale nothing can hold. Cars, trucks, people are blown down the street, smashing,
tumbling. An amazing spectacle.

375      Superman flies in the face of the gale force - trying to reach the people.

SUPERMAN 
        (pleadingly)
Stop it! .Please,  stop it!

376     ON THE VILLAINS -- They continue to blow the hurricane wind.

377     ON SUPERMAN -- As he stops to right a car, only to have it blown past him again.

                         SUPERMAN 
Enough! It's enough!

378     ON THE VILLAINS -- Paying him no mind, they continue.

379     ON SUPERMAN -- Staring up at them as he stands immovable in the path of the great wind. 
All around him is devastation. A terrible struggle is going on inside him.

380     ON PEOPLE -- gathered in doorways, trying to protect themselves from the wind, they 
watch fearfully.

381     ON SUPERMAN -- Suddenly he flies up, as if to confront the Villains. But then, halfway 
there, he suddenly turns and zooms off through the building and into the night. He is gone. 

382                         ZOD
                         (triumphant)
                    So, he is a coward after all! 

     The three stop the Super-Breath.






383     ON THE STEER -- The people pick themselves up, struggling to their feet. They look up at 
the sky with expressions of disbelief  and disillusionment .

                    THE CABBIE
        (angry)
He chickened out! That phony!

     A WOMAN
Superman! Don't leave us!

     The awful laughter of Zod and Ursa rings out in the air.

384     ON TWO BLACK KIDS, 8 and 9, with "street smarts" beyond their years, look at the sky,
 their cynicism confirmed.

                    FIRST BLACK KID
       (scornfully)
Huh. Superman didn't even do nothin'.

SECOND BLACK KID
                                    (calling up to the sky) 
Jive turkey!

     The sound of the villainous laughter continues.

385     INT. PERRY WHITE'S OFFICE  -  NIGHT

PERRY, LOIS, and JIMMY step back quickly as the VILLAINS land in the office. LUTHOR, still propped up against the wall, looks over expectantly.

                         ZOD
               Our victory is complete! The son of                               
          Jor-El has fled.

                         JIMMY
                             (stunned)

                              (disappointed)
                    You said it. Three-to-one should get you                                         both ears and the tail.

                         ZOD
                                   (angry)
                    He ran in fear from us . . .

                         LOIS
                                (defiant)
                    He'll be back. As long as he's alive                                              he'll try again.

                         ZOD
                    The next time - we will kill him!

     NON roars. LUTHOR rises, dusts himself off, turns to ZOD.

                         LUTHOR
                    Next time, next time . . .
                        (shakes his head)
                    What am I going to do with you people? I                                         hold up my end. I deliver the Blue Boy -                                         and what do I hear from my triple threat?                                    "Bow, yield, kneel" - that kind of stuff                                         closes out of town.

     ZOD stares hard at LUTHOR, icy, but curious.

                         ZOD
                    Why do you say this to me when you know
                    I will kill you for it?

                         LUTHOR

greatest criminal flame of our age?                          
Eradicate the only man on earth . . .

                         URSA
                       Kill him!

                    . . . with Superman's address?

     LUTHOR grins, in control now. ZOD examines him carefully.

                         ZOD
                    There is something more you want. The                                         greed is written on your face.

                         LUTHOR
                         (pause)
                    Perhaps a small . . . incentive, your                                              Ultimate. A tiny bauble to help me jog

                    Come! The three of us will crush the 
                    son of our jailer.

     NEW ANGLE URSA, as she advance on Lois.

                         URSA
                    Why not increase his handicap? Since he 
                    cares so much for these earth creatures,
                    let us take his favorite.












387     EXT. SKY  -  NIGHT

     LONG SHOT -- The Villains soar through the dark, star-filled sky. Ursa carries Luthor. 
Lois, rides Non.

                    LUTHOR
                       (muttering)
               No drinks . No movie. This is the last time I take 
a charter flight.

     ZOD
Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way?

     LUTHOR 
        (pointing)
North. Keep going North!

CLOSE ON ZOD -- flying high; he can hardly wait.

388     INT. FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE, MOLECULAR RESTRUCTURING CHAMBER - NIGHT

WIDE SHOT -- Inside the Fortress. Superman SEEN inside the molecular restructuring chamber.

INSIDE THE CHAMBER - Superman passes his hand very deliberately across various 
crystals in a specific sequence, much as he did once before in this setting. This is seen
briefly, leaving us not time to guess what he might be doing.

389     INT. FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE -  NIGHT

As they fly in the wide, multi-tiered interior:

                    ZOD
       (to Ursa)
Put down Lex Luthor !

     LUTHOR
      (did he hear right?) 
Put down Lex Luthor?

390     Ursa follows orders. She drops Luthor unceremoniously on a remote ledge.

LUTHOR
                           (indignantly)
                    Hey! Hey, who day's have to know to get
a ringside seat here?


391     ANOTHER ANGLE - As they land, still holding Lois. They look about them for the owner
of the house.

                    LOIS 
       (calling out)
Superman, this wasn't my idea!

Zod takes in the décor sneeringly.

                         ZOD
                    Morbid. A sentimental replica of a planet
long since vanished.

392     PAN UP, SHARP ANGLE: Superman suddenly appears above them, standing on the
highest balcony, looking down commandingly.

                    SUPERMAN
               I expect better manners from my guests.

     QUICK C.U. LOIS -- Much relieved to see him.

     FAVORING THE VILLAINS --

                    ZOD
                  (as he sees Superman;
                    savagely)
               Accept your destiny, Kal-El. Even as
               your father once condemned us, so
               now do we condemn his misbegotten
               brat.

                    SUPERMAN
                   (deliberately goading them)
               As we say on Earth, Zod -- "all talk
               and no action."

Non, made furious by the taunt, leaps from his place and springs at Superman.

393     EFFECTS: Quickly, in a dazzling display, Superman puts his hand to his chest. Magically, 
the "S SHIELD" emblazoned there becomes a literal object in his hand while its "original" 
remains on the costume. It shimmers and shines with an energy force that clearly connotes 
immense power .

Superman flings it like a discus.

394     The effect on Non as the "S SHIELD" hits him and wraps around him.



395     ON ZOD -- He looks worried. He is beginning to realize that Superman, on his home turf, has powers and devices at his command beyond their comprehension.

URSA 
      (sensing his fear) 
General --- ?

     ZOD
      (quickly reasserting his 
       authority)
We must combine our strength.


As Non reappears from one side, the three stand at points of an invisible triangle, facing
Superman.

                    ZOD 
We are three. He is one.


     LUTHOR (o.s.)
Great odds! What's the point spread?

ZOD 
        (fiercely)
The combined power of three will destroy you!
        (gives the command)
Now!

     EFFECTS:  From their three points, the three Villains beam red-hot. rays of Heat-Vision at 
Superman.

397     But, incredibly, as the three rays strike their common target, Superman reaches out and
physically grabs the apex of the combined beams in his fist. It has the effect of shorting them 
out in a spectacular way. Bolts of Kryptonian energy zap and crackle into the air from 
Superman's fist, negating the force, causing the startled Villains to reel back from the 
negative electrical charge.

398     C.U. SUPERMAN - still on guard, attuned to their every move.

399     ON THE VILLAINS -- Zod doesn't give up that easily.

                         ZOD
                           (smarting)
                    One way or another you will bow to me!

400     C.U. SUPERMAN - His eyes dart quickly around  the vast. interior.


401     POV: The three villains have suddenly disappeared; a little magic of their own.

ZOD (o.s.)
                    Now it is you who are confounded.

402     C.U. SUPERMAN -- Hi5 eyes dilate indicating  X-Ray Vision at work.

403     POV: EFFECTS - His X-Ray Vision REVEALS Ursa, Non and Zod behind opaque crystal 
blocks. Suddenly they disappear. There are three flashes of light, denoting  super-speed. Now they appear again, but behind different places.

404     C.U. SUPERMAN -- He blinks, confused.

405     EFFECTS: Again they shift position with lightening speed. The effect is to totally disorient 
Superman, as if he were in a Hall of Mirrors.

                    ZOD 
     (mocking him)
Now you see us, now you don't.

     Ursa's evil laughter rings out.

                         LUTHOR  (o.s.) 
                 (calling out from his corner)
     The old shell game, Super-sucker!

406     C.U. SUPERMAN -- A look of intense concentration.

407     WIDE ANGLE (EFFECTS:) Suddenly, one after another three images of Superman are 
projected from the "original  -- "real" Superman. As they spread out and face the villains in
the different areas of the Fortress , it is impossible to tell which of these four is the real 
Superman.

LUTHOR (o.s.)
                    Hey, what happened to the Marquis of 
Queensbury rules?

408     ON NON -- Disoriented at first, he dumbly turns on the "Superman" closest to him. With a
ferocious howl, he dives at it . . . . and sails right on through it. Coming out the other side; the 
expression on his face is priceless as he crashes head-on into a crystal wall. He slumps 
against it bruised and bewildered (and bewitched).

     Now this particular Superman image smiles, fades and vanishes.

409     ON URSA AND SUPERMAN IMAGE 2: She takes a flying leap at her "Superman," her 
boot up, aiming for a super-kick at his groin. But she ends up on the ground in a furious heap, as the "Superman" image breaks as if a shattered crystal and pieces fall to the ground.


410     NEW ANGLE -- A third Superman takes a step and speaks:

                         SUPERMAN 3
                          (calling to Zod, taunting)
                    How do you like these odds, General ? Or
are they too odd for you ?

     As he speaks Lois naturally assumes that this must be the "real" Superman and runs to him 
for protection.

411     ON ZOD -- certain now that the fourth remaining Superman is a phony, the final fake, he 
steps over to it, lifts his hand to flick it away.


412     ON LOIS WITH HER SUPERMAN

LOIS
                    Oh, Superman, I was ---

     As she speaks she throws her arms around him -- (EFFECTS) only to find that they pass 
right through his seemingly solid body. She reacts with dumbfounded surprise.

4l3     ON ZOD -- A split second later as Zod gives the brush-off to the fourth Superman he 
discovers that this "illusion" is reality.

SUPERMAN
                    One more mistake like that and you'll be busted
to Corporal, Zod.

     And with that he seizes him in a powerful grip. As Zod struggles to get free --

414     Ursa and Non swoop towards Lois and grab her -- each getting an arm. Now they begin to
pull like two people having a tug-of-war.

                    URSA
               Release the General or we tear her apart.

415     C.U. SUPERMAN -- what to do?

416     ON LOIS -- Suffering but brave.

                         LOIS
                    No, Superman! Don't!

     Non and Ursa pull harder. As Lois cries out in pain---




417     Superman reluctantly releases Zod.

     As Zod  steps away, dusting off his uniform.

                         ZOD
                            (contemptuously)
                    Did you really believe we would give up our 
advantage?

     URSA
         (laughing)
"Super-sucker . " For once, Lex Luthor was right.

     LUTHOR
          (offended)
Hey, let's be fair. Actually, there've been two or 
three times --

     ZOD
          (triumphant.)
Now I shall have the Son of Jor-El as my slave! Forever. 
If not, the millions of earthlings you protect will pay for 
your defiance. 
        (he snaps his fingers
          towards Lois)
Beginning with this one.

     LOIS
Don't do it, Superman! Not for me --

     Ursa and Non tighten their hold and pull her still harder. Pain stops her from speaking.

419     ON SUPERMAN -- thoroughly defeated.

                         SUPERMAN
                    Stop! Let her go!
                           (pause to Zod)
                    All right, Zod. you win. It's over.

420     Zod smiles, full of himself, looks around the Fortress at the Memory Bank , crystal rows, 
bench,  etc.

                    ZOD
                        (to Non)
               I sense the presence of Jor-El here. Destroy 
all this . . . .
          (at Luthor)
And we have no more need of this one. Kill him.

     (AT THIS POINT, GO TO FOOTAGE ALREADY SHOT FROM SCRIPT OF 26th 
SEPTEMBER 1977, PAGE 441, SHOT NUMBER 504, BEGINNING WITH LUTHOR' S      FIRST SPEECH ON THAT PAGE, BEGINNING: 

421                         LUTHOR
                    Me? General, it's me, Lex Luthor! Remember? 
                    Who got you through the tough times? You filled 
                    your inside straight? You came to me with nothing - 
                    except the world. I gave you Superman!

ZOD turns his back on him, walks away. NON begins to smash the crystal rows with enthusiastic relish.

     CLOSER ON LUTHOR AND SUPERMAN

     LUTHOR edges in closer to SUPERMAN, desperate, sweating.
          
                         LUTHOR     
                    You think you know people, right? Promises 
                    are made, gifts exchanged . . . what does it all 
mean anymore?  Not like the old days when 
it was just you and me. And I've got to hand it 
to you, Superman. You always told the truth. A 
fellow knew where he stood with you. You wanted 
to destroy me, pure and simple -- and I respected 
you for it.

NON raises SUPERMAN'S bench high over his head in B.G., smashes it to the floor. ZOD turns, looks at chamber, examining it cautiously from the outside. SUPERMAN looks at LUTHOR carefully. 

                         SUPERMAN
                                    (low voice)
                    Perhaps there is some good in you after 
all, Lex Luthor.

                         LUTHOR
                    Me? I'm loaded with good! I mean I've never 
even used it.

                         SUPERMAN
                    I'll have to take the chance. Try to get them all 
into that molecule chamber. It takes away their 
powers, reduces them to human beings. Now 
                    if you could . . .

                                                       CONTINUED


421     CONTINUED

     LUTHOR looks over. ZOD is about to enter the chamber.

                         LUTHOR
                    Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!

                         SUPERMAN
                    Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .

     ZOD turns, looks over, concerned.

                         LUTHOR
                    It's a molecule chamber, your Grace! It turns 
                    people like you into . . .
                                      (feels funny saying this)
                    people like me.

     ZOD looks up at the chamber, realizing the mistake he almost made. He turns.

                         ZOD
                    You have done well, Lex Luthor. We will 
award you this Cuba place.
                              (to URSA and NON)
                    Seize him!

URSA and NON spring at SUPERMAN, grab him, one on each leg and arm. SUPERMAN kicks and struggles vainly.
                    
                         SUPERMAN
                    No! Please! Don't! . . .

LOIS rushes to try and help, is caught by a grinning ZOD, unceremoniously flung backward to the floor. SUPERMAN is hurled into the chamber. LUTHOR rushes to the side, presses a control. The door irises shut. SUPERMAN lies on the floor, helpless.

                         ZOD
                    Lex Luthor! Ruler of Australia and the Cuba
                    place! Activate the machine!

     LUTHOR grins, pushes the starting mechanism.

      WIDE ANGLE

The chamber is activated. The lights in the Fortress begin to change - but this time they happen in the entire interior of the Fortress, and not in the chamber.



 422     ANGLE ON SUPERMAN IN CHAMBER

SUPERMAN writhes in agony on the chamber floor as the outside lights play on the surface of the chamber.

423     ANGLE ON VILLAINS, LUTHOR AND LOIS

The VILLAINS and LUTHOR watch with glee as the lights dance. LOIS hides her face in anguish.

424     BACK TO SUPERMAN

The de-molecular process ends. The door to the chamber irises open again. Slowly, painfully, SUPERMAN gets to his feet, his face crestfallen, his shoulders stooped, resigned to his defeat.

425     WIDER ANGLE

     LOIS looks at him in horror. ZOD smiles cruelly, steps forward, salivating in triumph.

                         ZOD
                    And now - finally - kneel!

SUPERMAN steps out of the chamber, shuts his eyes, the final humiliation sinking in. The hushed silence is deafening. He has no choice. He kneels. ZOD extends his hand in contempt.
               
                         ZOD
                    Take my hand and swear eternal loyalty 
to Zod.          

     SUPERMAN lifts his hand in disgrace.

     EXTREME CLOSE ON HANDS

SUPERMAN takes ZOD'S hand, then slowly starts to squeeze it. The sound of bones cracking is heard.

     BACK TO SCENE

ZOD'S eyes bulge with pain. SUPERMAN suddenly pulls back and jerks ZOD up and over his shoulder.

                                                       CONTINUED





425     CONTINUED

     ANGLE ON ZOD

ZOD is hurled helplessly through the air the entire length of the Fortress, crashes against the far wall, drops to the floor.

     BACK TO SCENE

     LUTHOR horrified, suddenly realizes what's happened.

                         LUTHOR
                    He switched it! He did it to them! The lights 
                    were on our here! He was the only one safe in 
                    there!

426     NON rushes at SUPERMAN with a roar, is tossed into the wall in a heap like a rag doll. 
LOIS turns to URSA, the new information sinking in.

                         LOIS
                    You're a real pain in the neck, you know that?

427     LOIS uncorks a tremendous haymaker, knocks URSA out cold on the floor. SUPERMAN advances on LUTHOR.

                         SUPERMAN
                    I knew you'd double-cross me, Luthor. A lying 
                    weasel like you couldn't resist the chance . . .

                         LUTHOR
                                  (backing up)
                    Are you kidding? I knew it all the time. Did you 
see how they fell into our trap? Beautiful . . .

                         SUPERMAN
                    Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .

                         LUTHOR
                    Listen. Have I got a proposition for you, Superman. I 
mean I owe you one, you know? Now don't say yes 
or no till you hear me out . . .








428     EXT. FORTRESS  -  DAY

     LONG SHOT as we hear from within:

                         SUPERMAN
                        (from inside)
                    Which one would you like to join, Luthor?
                    Pick a hole.

                         LUTHOR
                         (from inside)
                    Wait a minute, wait a minute, let's talk
                    a deal, Superman. We can take a lunch 
                    on this --

     SOUND: a crash from inside.

     After a pause:

                         LOIS
                        (from inside)
                    Gee, who'd have thought he'd sink
                    the lowest?

     DISSOLVE SLOWLY TO:

429     INT. DAILY PLANET  -  DAY

ON CLARK -- looking a bit nervous and unsure of himself, as he comes to work and walks toward Lois' desk.

HIS POV: Lois at her desk, looking tense, edgy, a bit hyper.

COME IN TO TWO SHOT as he reaches her desk. The following is quietly spoken, though not whispered. But there's nobody in the immediate vicinity to overhear. (Though, at one point, we SEE Jimmy in b.g.)

There is a tentative feeling about everything as Clark says:

                         CLARK
                    Hi.

                         LOIS 
                 (trying to be cool: failing at it)
     Oh, hi.

429     CONTINUED

          CLARK 
Sleep well?

     LOIS
Never closed my eyes.

His love and compassion show as he comes closer to her, looking at her with understanding
     of her dilemma. MOVE IN TO TIGHTER SHOT  -  he pulls up a chair.

                         CLARK
                    Lois . . .

      BEGIN SLOW MOVE IN TO C.U. LOIS AS SHE SPEAKS  -  All the conflicting emotions
     and thoughts coming out after a long and troubled night.

                         LOIS
                    I know, I know all the arguments, you don't have 
to tell me. That's what I did all night -- I "listened 
to the voices of  reason" till the dawn came up. Do
you have any idea what a vile sound it to hear the 
first bird singing when you've been up night crying?

          CLARK
                                        (concerned)
                    I'm sorry.

     C.U. LOIS

                         LOIS
                    Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me,
"It's like being married to a doctor," I said. Doctors 
are practically never at home. The get emergency 
calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage 
to live with it. Then a voice said, " could you be a 
doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . "

                         CLARK
                    You're not selfish at all.

                         LOIS
                    Oh, when it comes to you I am. Not that I don't 
                    understand why they all need you. but they can't
                    need you more than I do.

                    Everybody. Everybody else. I'd be buying my
                    little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones 
                    who say "Help. Come quick. Now" I know
                    who you'd have to pick.

                    What else could I do?

                         LOIS
                         (being fair)
                    Oh, I'm not blaming you.
                         (being honest)
                    I just know me. I'd be jealous. Jealous 
                    of . . . of all humanity.
                          (an ironic smile)

      MOVE IN TO VERY TIGHT TWO SHOT:  They look into each other's eyes. He takes
     off his glasses.

                    Say you love me.
     
     He takes her face in his hand and pulls her toward him. Though they have made love
when he was briefly a mortal, this is the first and only time we have seen Superman kiss
her. IN C.U., it is a profound, lyrical, passionate kiss -- it is indeed magical.

     When at last he releases her, she moves back, opening her eyes, blinking as if she had just      awakened from a dream.

     PULL BACK AND WIDEN:  as she shakes her head, like somebody who has had a dizzy
     spell. CLARK puts his glasses back on.

                    The human body is only a workable, fairly
                    fragile machine when you treat it with the
                    same respect you'd show to ----

                              puts her fingers to her eyes
                               and again shakes her head)
                    . . . gee . . . 

                         CLARK
                    Take it easy. Take a deep breath.

LOIS
                     I'm fine. . . . . .
       (focusing)
What  was I talking about?  Before?

JIMMY
                    If I know you. Miss Lane, it was probably 
about Superman.

     QUICK C.U. CLARK -- just watching her; no expression.

LOIS
                (trying to remember) 
      . . . Superman?. . . . .
                    
                         CLARK
                    Lois, I really don't see why --

LOIS
Clark, stop feeling so threatened every time you 
hear his name. Nobody expects you to be what
you're not.

MED. C.U. CLARK -- a wry smile; and  in his eyes . . . memories.

                    CLARK
               I'll try to remember that . . .

                    LOIS
Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too,
you know.

CLARK
                                 (playing "Clark") 
You do?

LOIS
                    Sure. Especially if you'd be a really terrific guy
and bring me a cheeseburger to go --

     ON CLARK -- He smiles. Whatever his own pain, he is happy to see her feeling none .

CLARK 
Everything on it?

     LOIS 
Everything on it.

     As he grabs his hat and starts to leave:

LOIS
Oh, and --

                         CLARK
                    I know, I know, only if it's fresh-squeezed.

With one last little fond look back, he turns and leaves. STAY ON LOIS AND JIMMY.

LOIS
         (blithely)
There goes a nice guy.
        (she roll a fresh
          sheet of paper into
          her typewriter)
Now then, what trouble can I get
into today . . . 
         (to Jimmy)
What's going on in the world,
Jimmy?

430     INT. DINER - DAY 

The same Alaskan Diner visited earlier by CLARK and LOIS. CAMERA CI.OSE on the same burlv TRUCKER seen earlier as he eats a noisy lunch, sitting on a stool directly at the corner of the "L"-shaped counter. He munches down on his food as a FIGURE appears behind him.

TRUCKER
        (to Counterman)
Gimme another order of that bacon, Will
ya?

     CLARK'S VOICE 
That's funny.  I didn't know swine were cannibals .

     The TRUCKER blinks, swirls slowly in his seat as CAMARA PULLS BACK: Clark 
stands 
behind him, looks down.
                              CLARK
                    You're sitting in my seat, Pig-face.

                              TRUCKER
                    Come and get it four-eyes. . .

430     CONTINUED

The TRUCKER spins in his seat, uncorks a tremendous right hand to the midsection; he screams as his fist cracks into what seems like solid granite, breaking a bone. CLARK leans down, spins the stool in the opposite direction at dizzying speed. The TRUCKER becomes a whirling blur, his seat spiraling upward until it reaches counter level. CLARK reaches out, taps him at exactly the right moment; the TRUCKER flies down the length of the counter through napkin holders, salt shakers, and other people's meals, crashes against the wall, lands in a heap. The COUNTERMAN gapes at CLARK unbelievingly.

                         CLARK
                             (nice smile)
                    I've been working out.

431     EXT. SKY  -  DAY

Against a clear blue sky we see SUPERMAN in C.U. flying at speed holding a flag-pole so that a huge American Flag streams out from behind him.

432     EXT. WHITE HOUSE  -  DAY

The camera CUTS WIDE to reveal SUPERMAN approaching the roof of the White House. He swoops in behind the trees carrying the flag and flag-pole, which is attached to a new translucent roof-dome (to replace the dome fractured by the entrance of the villains).

433     INT. WHITE HOUSE CORRIDOR  -  DAY

We CUT as the PRESIDENT opens the door from his Oval Office and looks out and upwards to the broken corridor ceiling. We see SUPERMAN land on the roof and as he begins to place the new dome in position, he talks to the PRESIDENT. The LAST SHOT
is SUPERMAN C.U., the flag still streaming behind him, as the roof is positioned.

WE THEN CUT TO SC. 437.

437     EXT. SKY  -  DUSK

SUPERMAN is flying home, the sun setting gloriously behind him. Against this awesome spectacle, HOLD CAMERA as he soars AWAY FROM F.G. heading for the horizon, magnificent in his power. Faster than a speeding bullet. More powerful than a locomotive. Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound. look! Up in the sky! Is it a bird! Is it a plane! No! It's Superman.
