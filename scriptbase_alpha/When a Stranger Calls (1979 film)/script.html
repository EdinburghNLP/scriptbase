FADE IN:

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT

A quiet upper-middle class neighborhood. The CAMERA is at 
the curb, looking down the street. There are no sidewalks. 
Trees arch overhead. CICADAS drone on the soundtrack.

The OPENING TITLES briefly FADE IN and OUT, framed by the 
trees on either side of the street. Footsteps are heard 
approaching.

As the picture TITLE FADES, out of the dark emerges a GIRL 
17 years old, carrying schoolbooks. This is JILL. CAMERA 
PANS with her ninety degrees as she comes to the front of a 
house and stops.

Lights are on in the bottom half of the house, and the 
curtains across the windows are open. A single light burns 
in the upper right side of the house, presumable in a bedroom, 
but the curtains in the room are drawn.

A scene TITLE appears on the lower half of the screen:

				8 pm Tuesday, March 23, 1971

The TITLE FADES, and Jill heads up the walk to the front 
door of the house.

The light in the upper floor of the house is turned off.

INT. HOUSE - FRONT HALL

A middle-aged DOCTOR is standing at the foot of the stairs. 
His WIFE is descending the stairs, putting on her earrings. 
She is in an obvious hurry.

		WIFE
	Where's the girl?

		DOCTOR
	I only called her ten minutes ago --

		WIFE
		(passing into living 
		room)
	I made our reservation for 8:15. 
	We're going to be late.

The doorbell rings.

		DOCTOR
	Here she is now.

He crosses to the front door and opens it. The girl smiles 
at him uncomfortably from outside.

		JILL
	Dr. Minakis?

		DOCTOR
	Mandrakis. It's okay. Everyone gets 
	it wrong the first time. You're Jill? 
	Come on in.

		JILL
		(entering)
	Thank you.

The wife comes back into the front hall.

		WIFE
	I've written the number of the 
	restaurant on the notepad by the 
	phone.
		(to Doctor)
	Zip me up, will you please?
		(to Jill)
	If we aren't home in two hours, it 
	means we've decided to go on to a 
	movie and won't be back until after 
	midnight. Is that all right?

		JILL
	Sure.

		DOCTOR
		(helping wife on with 
		her coat)
	I've told my service to pick up any 
	calls coming in to my office phone.

		WIFE
	The children are asleep upstairs -- 
	first door on your left at the top 
	of the landing. They're both just 
	getting over a cold -- so try not to 
	wake them.

		JILL
	Okay.

		WIFE
	Do you have any questions?

Jill shakes her head.

		WIFE
	We have to go now. We're late.

They cross to the front door and begin to exit.

		DOCTOR
	Make yourself at home. The 
	refrigerator's loaded.

		WIFE
		(pulling doctor through 
		the door)
	Goodbye.

The doctor pokes his head back through the door.

		DOCTOR
	We even have some low-fat yogurt.

		WIFE (O.S.)
	Will you please come on!

		DOCTOR
	Bye.

The doctor pulls the door shut behind him. Jill turns toward 
the living room. Pause. She walks into the living room and 
sets her books down on a table with the telephone on it.

O.S. we hear the car doors close, the engine start up, then 
the car backing out the driveway and heading down the street.

											CUT TO:

INT. DINING ROOM - LATER

It is dark. O.S. we hear the phone in the living room being 
lifted off its receiver, a dial tone, then a number is dialed. 
Pause, then ringing. CAMERA SLOWLY DOLLIES from the dining 
room, across the front hall and into the living room where 
we see Jill talking over the phone to a girlfriend, NANCY.

		NANCY (O.S.)
	Hello?

		JILL
	Nancy?

		NANCY (O.S.)
	Hello, Jill? How's it going?
		(out of phone)
	I got it, Dad!
		(beat)
	Father!
		(into phone again)
	Jesus Christ! My father's in one of 
	his moods again. Male menopause, you 
	know. So how are you?

		JILL
	All right.

		NANCY (O.S.)
	Are you over at Dr. Mandrakis'?

		JILL
	Yeah, I've been here for about an 
	hour already.

		NANCY (O.S.)
	Isn't it a neat house?

		JILL
	I guess... I haven't looked around 
	very much.

		NANCY (O.S.)
	Did you see his kids?

		JILL
	No, they were asleep when I got here.

		NANCY (O.S.)
	They're really cute. So what can I 
	do for you?

		JILL
	You didn't happen to talk to Billy 
	today, did you?

		NANCY (O.S.)
	Yeah, I talked to him.

		JILL
	Did he say anything about me?

Pause.

		NANCY (O.S.)
	I don't know what you did to him, or 
	said to him, or what... but he's 
	really pissed off at you! What did 
	you do?

		JILL
	It's what I didn't do.

		NANCY (O.S.)
		(sarcastic)
	Yeah, I can imagine.

		JILL
	Do me a favor, Nance.

		NANCY (O.S.)
	What.

		JILL
	Do you think you'll be talking with 
	Billy some time tonight?

		NANCY (O.S.)
	Prabably. I'm going to the library 
	in a few minutes. I just have to get 
	out of this house!
		(beat)
	Hey! Why don't Billy and I come over 
	there? He'll come along if I tell 
	him to.

		JILL
	That isn't what I had in mind.

		NANCY (O.S.)
	You'll be safe with Billy. I'll be 
	there. Come on.

		JILL
	Nancy, all you want to do is come 
	over here and get drunk.

		NANCY (O.S.)
	Who? Me?

		JILL
		(mimicking)
	Who? Me?

		NANCY (O.S.)
	You want to see Billy, don't you?!

		JILL
	I've got a lot of work to do. I don't 
	want you coming over!

Long pause.

		NANCY (O.S.)
	You know what your problem is, Jill, 
	is you're so straight. I really mean 
	that. You go to a private school, 
	you wear a bra. No one can have a 
	good time with you!
		(beat)
	You know, Billy asked me to go out 
	with him this weekend, and I was 
	really really tempted because I like 
	Billy... a lot... as much as you do. 
	But I told him I couldn't, that I 
	didn't think it was right because 
	you were my friend --

		JILL
	You are my friend.

Pause.

		NANCY (O.S.)
	Yeah. I guess so.

		JILL
	Listen, just give Billy the number 
	here, but don't tell him I told you 
	to. Okay?

Pause.

		NANCY (O.S.)
	Okay. I've got to go now.

		JILL
	Okay, Nancy. Bye. And thank you.

		NANCY (O.S.)
	Yeah. Bye.

Jill makes a face at the phone and hangs up. She tries to go 
back to her homework, but she cannot.

											CUT TO:

INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

Jill is working now, diligently. The phone rings. She picks 
it up.

		JILL
	Hello?

There is a brief pause; then the line goes dead and a dial 
tone cuts in. Jill hangs up and goes back to work.

Pause.

The phone rings again. Jill picks it up.

		JILL
	Billy?...

A VOICE speaks on the other end of the phone.

		DUNCAN (O.S.)
	Have you checked the children?

		JILL
	What?

The line goes dead. Dial tone. Jill hangs up and goes right 
back to work.

											CUT TO:

INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

Jill sits at the table as before, doing her homework, smoking 
a cigarette. The phone rings. Jill picks it up.

		JILL
	Hello?

		DUNCAN (O.S.)
	Have you checked the children?

		JILL
	Mrs. Mandrakis?

The line goes dead. Dial tone. Jill hangs up and looks off 
into space, thinking.

O.S. we hear a faint rattling noise from somewhere in the 
house. Jill hears it too. She stubs out her cigarette, gets 
up from the table and walks out of the living room.

INT. HALLWAY

Jill enters the hallway and pauses. Then she starts walking 
slowly down the hall to the kitchen door.

Again the rattling noise O.S., only louder this time. Jill 
stops dead, listens, then continues forward even more 
cautiously.

INT. KITCHEN

As Jill enters. She cannot find the lightswitch, so she stands 
in the darkness listening. Again the rattle, very close now. 
Jill turns her head sharply, then walks to the refrigerator 
and opens it. It is only the automatic icemaker creating the 
rattle.

Jill takes a piece of cake from the refrigerator and leaves 
the kitchen.

INT. LIVING ROOM

Jill is sitting at the table, polishing off the cake. Then, 
the phone rings. Jill stands up quickly and picks up the 
phone.

		JILL
	Hello!

Pause.

		DUNCAN (O.S.)
	Have you checked the children?

		JILL
	Billy! I don't think this is very 
	funny!

Pause. "Billy" doesn't answer.

		JILL
	...Who is this?

The line goes dead. Jill stands frozen beside the table with 
the phone in her hand as the dial tone gets louder and louder.

											CUT TO:

INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Jill is standing at the wet bar in the corner, pouring herself 
a drink. She samples the alcohol, doesn't cough, and starts 
to pour a little more into the glass.

The phone rings. Jill turns, then slowly walks to the table, 
kneels down and quietly picks up the phone and brings it to 
her ear. She waits and listens, a full three seconds. No 
sound comes to her.

She quickly hangs up the phone before the silence can be 
broken by the voice she knows is waiting on the other end. 
Then, she shuffles through her books and papers on the table-
top until she finds the notepad the doctor's wife has left 
for her with the name and phone number of the restaurant.

Jill picks up the phone and dials. After several rings...

		MAITRE D' (O.S.)
	Golden Bull...

		JILL
	Hello, I'd like to speak to Dr. 
	Mandrakis. This is his babysitter.

		MAITRE D' (O.S.)
	Hold on a minute.

Jill waits for several seconds until the Maitre D' comes 
back on the line.

		MAITRE D' (O.S.)
	Hello?

		JILL
	Yes?

		MAITRE D' (O.S.)
	Dr. Mandrakis left the restaurant 
	about forty minutes ago.

		JILL
	Forty minutes?

		MAITRE D' (O.S.)
	That's right.

		JILL
		(after a beat)
	Okay. Thank you.

She hangs up, thinks for a moment, then picks up the phone 
again and dials "O"...

		OPERATOR (O.S.)
	Operator...

		JILL
	Hello, Operator? Can you get me the 
	police?

		OPERATOR (O.S.)
	Is this an emergency?

		JILL
	Yes!
		(beat)
	No, not really.

		OPERATOR (O.S.)
	The number is 555-9431. Would you 
	like me to connect you?

		JILL
	Please.

Pause.

		MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
	Seventh Precinct, Sergeant Sacker.

		JILL
	Hello, I've been getting phone calls, 
	every fifteen minutes or so. I think 
	it's a man. He's trying to scare me.

		SACKER (O.S.)
	An anonymous caller?

		JILL
	That's right.

		SACKER (O.S.)
	Has he threatened you?

		JILL
	No.

		SACKER (O.S.)
	Has he been using obscene language?

		JILL
	No. He just keeps calling me. 
	Sometimes he doesn't say anything.

		SACKER (O.S.)
	There's really nothing we can do 
	about it down here. Is the phone 
	listed in your name?

		JILL
	No, I'm just the babysitter.

		SACKER (O.S.)
	It's probably just some weirdo. The 
	city's full of them. Believe it or 
	not, we get reports like this every 
	night. It's nothing to worry about.

		JILL
	Oh...

		SACKER (O.S.)
	Have you tried whistling?

		JILL
	What?

		SACKER (O.S.)
	If you can find a good loud whistle 
	somewhere in the house, blow it into 
	the phone hard, next time he calls. 
	Probably break his eardrum. He won't 
	bother you after that.

		JILL
	No, I... You're probably right. It's 
	nothing to worry about.

		SACKER (O.S.)
	Or you could just take your phone 
	off the hook.

		JILL
	No, the people I'm babysitting for 
	might try to reach me.

		SACKER (O.S.)
	Well, as I say, there's nothing we 
	can really do to help you down here.

		JILL
	Okay. Thank you.

		SACKER (O.S.)
	You bet. Goodnight.

		JILL
	Goodnight.

Jill hangs up. After thinking for a moment, she tries a couple 
of ways of whistling as loud as she can, but frustrated and 
feeling foolish, she soon gives up.

											CUT TO:

INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

Jill is sitting in an armchair facing the TV set. The TV is 
on, but she is bored. She runs through several channels, 
then gets up and turns the TV off.

She looks around and moves aimlessly back to the table, but 
O.S. a dog is barking and she is drawn to the window. A car 
passes outside, its lights reflecting off the window and 
Jill's face.

Then the phone rings. Jill moves quickly from the window to 
the table and answers the phone.

		JILL
	Hello?

Pause.

		DUNCAN (O.S.)
	Why haven't you checked the children?

Stunned, Jill hangs up the phone. She turns and goes slowly 
back to the window. She pulls the shutters closed in front 
of the window. Then she walks out of the living room.

INT. FRONT HALL

Jill goes to the front door, turns the bolt and draws the 
chain across the door. Then she starts to go upstairs.

The phone rings. She stops halfway up the stairs. She turns 
and comes back down the stairs to answer the phone, but then 
thinks better of it. She sits on the bottom step and lets 
the phone ring and ring...

Finally, it stops. Jill gets up and heads into the living 
room.

INT. LIVING ROOM

Jill goes to the table, picks up the phone and dials...

		SACKER (O.S.)
	Seventh Precinct, Sergeant Sacker.

		JILL
	I called you before... about the man 
	who keeps calling me?

		SACKER (O.S.)
	Oh, yeah.

		JILL
	He called me again.

		SACKER (O.S.)
	Did you try whistling?

		JILL
	No, he's out there somewhere.

		SACKER (O.S.)
	Out where?

		JILL
	In the neighborhood. He's been 
	watching me... through the windows.

		SACKER (O.S.)
	Did you see him?

		JILL
	No. I know he's there.

		SACKER (O.S.)
	Is the house locked up?

		JILL
	Yes.

		SACKER (O.S.)
	And the windows?

		JILL
	Yes. Everything.

		SACKER (O.S.)
	Then you're safe. If he wanted to 
	break in, he wouldn't be calling 
	you.

Pause.

		JILL
	Please, can't you help me? I'm all 
	alone.

		SACKER (O.S.)
	Tell you what. If this guy calls you 
	again --

		JILL
	He will call again! I know he will!

		SACKER (O.S.)
	Okay, calm down now. I can alert the 
	phone company so that if he calls 
	again we can try to trace the call. 
	What's your number there?

		JILL
	555-0672.

		SACKER (O.S.)
	And the address?

		JILL
	3317 Oakridge Drive.

		SACKER (O.S.)
	Oh, yeah, I know where that is. All 
	right. If the guy calls again, try 
	to keep him on the line for at least 
	a minute so we can trace the call.

		JILL
	But he never stays on that long! 
	Sometimes he hangs up after just a 
	couple of seconds.

		SACKER (O.S.)
	It's the only way we can help you.
		(beat)
	By the way, what's your name?

		JILL
	Jill Johnson.

		SACKER (O.S.)
	Jill, the important thing is to relax. 
	You're safe where you are. We've got 
	patrolmen cruising the area all night 
	long. Just stay calm. Will you do 
	that for me?

		JILL
	Yes.

		SACKER (O.S.)
	In the meantime, we'll be watching 
	your line. Okay, Jill?

		JILL
	Okay.

		SACKER (O.S.)
	Call again if there's any problem.

		JILL
	Thank you.

		SACKER (O.S.)
	Goodnight.

Jill hangs up the phone and looks forlornly off into space.

											CUT TO:

INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

Jill is sitting on the sofa, a drink in one hand, a cigarette 
in the other. She is waiting. She sets her glass down, stubs 
out the cigarette, leans back and sighs. She is very tense.

Then the phone rings. She rises from the sofa and slowly 
crosses to the table. She sits down and picks up the phone. 
During this conversation it becomes apparent that the VOICE 
has a slight English accent.

		JILL
	Hello?

Pause.

		DUNCAN (O.S.)
	It's me.

		JILL
	I know. Who are you?

Pause. No answer.

		JILL
	I won't be here much longer. The 
	doctor and his wife are coming home 
	soon.

		DUNCAN (O.S.)
	I know.

		JILL
	Can you see me?

		DUNCAN (O.S.)
	Yes.

		JILL
		(turning toward the 
		window)
	I'm sorry I turned the lights down. 
	It didn't work anyway. I can turn 
	them back up if you like --

		DUNCAN (O.S.)
	Don't.

		JILL
	Don't?
		(beat)
	You've really scared me. Is that 
	what you wanted?
		(beat)
	Is that what you wanted?

		DUNCAN (O.S.)
	No.

		JILL
	What do you want?

		DUNCAN (O.S.)
	Your blood... all over me.

Pause. Jill is terrified.

		JILL
	You don't know me. You don't know 
	who I am or where I live. I'll get 
	Dr. Mandrakis to drive me home. Him 
	or the police.

		DUNCAN (O.S.)
	You've called the police?

Pause. Jill searches for some way of answering him.

		JILL
	I want to talk to you.

The line goes dead. Jill hangs up. She stands. She starts to 
shake.

The phone rings and Jill snatches it up.

		JILL
	Leave me alone!

		SACKER (O.S.)
	Jill, this is Sergeant Sacker! Listen 
	to me!
		(beat)
	We've traced the call. It's coming 
	from within the house. A squad car's 
	on its way over there now... just 
	get out of that house!

Jill hangs up. She stands frozen in shock. Several seconds 
go by. She doesn't move.

Then the phone rings. She turns and tiptoes toward the front 
door. Halfway there, the phone stops ringing. She pauses for 
a second, then continues.

INT. FRONT HALL

Jill reaches the front door. Carefully, quietly, she turns 
the bolt. Then O.S. she hears a creak. She turns and looks 
up the staircase. At the top, a door is opening. Someone is 
coming out! A mumbling sound is heard on the sound track.

Jill whirls around back to the door and yanks at it. It opens, 
but only an inch. The chain is still across it! She 
frantically works to get the chain free. After agonizing 
seconds, the chain falls clear and the door swings open.

Standing there on the other side of the door, is a police 
Detective, JOHN CLIFFORD. (We have cut ahead in time some 
twenty or thirty minutes.) Behind him on the street, several 
patrol cars and an ambulance are pulled up at the curb, their 
domelights silently flashing.

		CLIFFORD
	Are the parents here yet?

		COP'S VOICE (O.S.)
	Yeah, they arrived about ten minutes 
	ago.

		CLIFFORD
	Christ!
		(beat)
	What a homecoming!

		COP'S VOICE (O.S.)
	They wanted to talk to someone. I 
	asked them to wait until you got 
	here. Come on in.

Clifford sighs and steps into the front hall. The door is 
closed by the uniformed COP with whom Clifford has been 
speaking. The cop is a man in his thirties. His name is 
CHARLES GARBER. Garber and Clifford stand in the front hall 
and talk as POLICEMEN and AMBULANCE ATTENDANTS move around 
them. In the living room beyond can be seen several other 
POLICEMEN, Dr. Mandrakis and his wife.

		GARBER
	We were only a block away when the 
	call went out. When we got here, the 
	guy was still waiting upstairs in 
	the children's bedroom. He was covered 
	with blood.

		CLIFFORD
	Blood?

		GARBER
	Not his own. The children had been 
	dead for several hours.

		CLIFFORD
	Jesus...

		GARBER
	He'd been using an old phone in their 
	bedroom that the parents had never 
	had disconnected.

		CLIFFORD
	Who is he?

		GARBER
	We found a Merchant Seaman's card on 
	him. He's English. Entered the country 
	less than a week ago.

		CLIFFORD
	How about the babysitter?

		GARBER
	She's going to be all right.

As Garber delivers his final line, we see ambulance attendants 
dressed in white, taking a sheet-covered stretcher out the 
front door.

										FADE OUT:

FADE IN:

EXT. STREET - LATER AFTERNOON

An upper-class neighborhood. The CAMERA is facing down the 
street. A car approaches the intersection at the end of the 
block, turns and comes slowly up the street.

Because it is not a new car or an expensive car, and because 
it is moving at a rate which suggests that its sole male 
occupant is looking for house numbers, we can assume that 
the DRIVER is a visitor to this neighborhood.

The CAMERA PANS with the car ninety degrees as it turns into 
the semi-circular driveway of a mansion and rolls up to the 
front door.

A TITLE appears across the bottom of the screen:

			4:30 pm Thursday, April 20, 1978

As the TITLE FADES, the driver shuts off the car engine and 
opens the door to get out.

											CUT TO:

INT. MANSION - DAY

The doorbell rings. A HOUSEBOY comes into the front hall, 
goes to the door and opens it for the visitor. It is John 
Clifford, the detective from six years ago.

He has aged noticeably over the years. His hair is grayer, 
his stance not so aggressive, but his eyes still smoulder 
with the accumulated frustration of having spent years in an 
uncertain, sometimes unsatisfying, and frequently unsafe 
occupation.

No words are exchanged as the houseboy leads Clifford across 
the entrance hall and up an imposing flight of stairs. Still 
keen in his observation of things, Clifford quickly takes in 
this new atmosphere.

The house is richly decorated but with an underlying theme 
of melancholy. There are no bright or cheerful furnishings, 
and the houseboy advances with guarded tread, his face steady 
and reverent.

The houseboy stops before a door at the top of the staircase 
and raps lightly on it with his knuckles. Without waiting 
for an answer, he opens the door and steps aside for Clifford 
to enter.

Clifford pauses briefly, then walks into what appears to be 
an upstairs study.

INT. STUDY - DAY

A MAN is sitting behind a desk which faces the door. 
Presumably he is the master of the house. Although his face 
is hidden in shadows, we can see from his hands that he is 
engaged in writing something down.

Clifford quietly approaches the desk and takes a seat in 
front of it. Then, vaguely in keeping with the spirit of the 
house, he waits to be spoken to rather than interrupt the 
pervasive stillness.

After a moment, the master of the house lays down his pen 
and leans back in his chair. Pause.

		MASTER
	So you're in business for yourself 
	now.

		CLIFFORD
		(quietly)
	Yes, sir, for the past three and a 
	half years.

		MASTER
	That's good.
		(beat)
	And you'd heard about Curt Duncan's 
	escape?

		CLIFFORD
	Oh, yes.

		MASTER
	Do you think the police will... find 
	him?

Pause.

		CLIFFORD
	I know they haven't assigned anyone 
	to it specifically. It's an old case.

		MASTER
		(a tinge of bitterness)
	An old case.
		(beat)
	Can you find him?

		CLIFFORD
	Yes. Maybe not tomorrow, maybe not 
	this week, but I'll find him.

		MASTER
	He could be anywhere by now.

		CLIFFORD
	I don't think so... because he's a 
	foreigner. He'll come back to the 
	city. After six years in confinement, 
	it's the only place that's familiar 
	to him. That's important.

Pause.

		MASTER
	A man murders two children in cold 
	blood. A jury declares him insane. 
	How could such a person not be?

Clifford lowers his eyes, doesn't answer.

		MASTER
	He is sent to a state mental 
	institution where the security is... 
	less than perfect. And he escapes. 
	It... it isn't fair.

The master of the house leans way forward over his desk, and 
his face comes out of the shadows and into the light. It is 
Dr. Mandrakis.

He seems much older. His complexion is pallid. His eyes stare 
out from beneath his brow like a wounded animal hiding in a 
dark cave.

		MANDRAKIS
	A thing like that should never be 
	allowed to happen again.

		CLIFFORD
	I couldn't agree with you more.

They look at each other for a long moment of acknowledgment. 
Then Mandrakis stands up with a sigh.

		MANDRAKIS
	Go ahead then. My accountant will 
	contact you.

Clifford stands and they shake hands.

		CLIFFORD
	Thank you.
		(beat)
	How is Mrs. Mandrakis?

		MANDRAKIS
	She is... unable to have any more 
	children.

		CLIFFORD
	I'm sorry. Please give her my best.

		MANDRAKIS
	Of course.

Clifford turns to go.

INT. MANSION - STAIRCASE &amp; ENTRANCE HALL

As Clifford finds his own way down the stairs and out the 
front door.

A WOMAN watches Clifford leave from the back of the staircase. 
It is Mrs. Mandrakis. As with her husband, the change in her 
is remarkable. She is now a brooding, barren woman.

O.S. the front door closes. Clifford is gone. Mrs. Mandrakis 
walks around the front of the stairs and begins slowly 
ascending them.

The houseboy silently steps into the entrance hall from a 
side door and watches her.

											CUT TO:

INT. A HALLWAY - MENTAL INSTITUTION - DAY

A male PATIENT wearing green, institutional pajamas and 
slippers shuffles slowly up the hall. His movement is 
catatonic, unfocused.

Canned Musak faintly underscores the scene.

		MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
	Curt Duncan isn't going to run right 
	out and kill more children. I'm not 
	worried about that.

ANGLE ON CLIFFORD

Standing in the doorway of an office, facing into the hall, 
watching the patient.

		MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
	We had him for six years... under 
	continuous therapy, some of it rather 
	forceful...

ANGLE ON PATIENT

Moving past CAMERA. He is really out of it. It is a 
depressing, vaguely unnerving sight.

		MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
	...and drugs... tranquilizers 
	depressants, lithium...

ANGLE ON CLIFFORD

He turns and goes back into the office.

INT. OFFICE - DAY

We see now the MAN who's been talking -- the director of the 
State Hospital, DR. MONK. He is sitting comfortably behind 
his desk; his jacket off, his tie loosened, his feet up on 
the desk. He is very matter-of-fact.

		DR. MONK
	Eventually, anyone will respond to 
	the treatment here.

Clifford sits down in front of the desk, picks up a folder 
and leafs through it.

		CLIFFORD
	You gave him electric shock?

		DR. MONK
	Yeah, we zapped him a few times. 
	It's fairly standard.

		CLIFFORD
	It says here thirty-eight... thirty-
	eight times.

Monk shrugs, then yawns expansively. He needn't justify 
himself to the layman.

		CLIFFORD
	What will happen to him now, without 
	the drugs he was on?

DR. MONK'S SECRETARY enters the office and hands him a folder. 
Without interrupting the delivery of his lines, Monk takes 
the folder, opens it, initials something on the inside, closes 
the folder and hands it back to the secretary who turns and 
leaves the office without uttering a word.

		DR. MONK
	There'll be some deterioration. That's 
	inevitable, but we can't say how 
	much.

Pause. Clifford looks at the doctor as if questioning his 
casual assessment of "some deterioration."

		CLIFFORD
	During the time that you had him 
	here, did you discover any particular 
	habits of his, peculiarities, quirks, 
	anything that might help me find 
	him?

		DR. MONK
		(shrugging again)
	It's all in the folder.

		CLIFFORD
	Any letters from people back in 
	England? Family?

		DR. MONK
	That, too, is in the folder.

Clifford directs a bleak look back down at the open folder, 
then looks up again, his eyes narrowing.

		CLIFFORD
	Let's get something straight here, 
	Doctor. I've been 33 years in the 
	business of tracking people down and 
	putting them away. I spent almost a 
	year on Curt Duncan alone, with the 
	trial, the testimonies, the background 
	investigations. I didn't come here 
	today to look in your goddamn folders. 
	In fact, I wouldn't have come here 
	at all if you'd done your job right.

Pause.

		DR. MONK
	Mr. Clifford, this is a hospital, 
	not a penitentiary. Everything that 
	pertains to one of our patients is 
	meticulously recorded in that 
	patient's folder... whether you can 
	make sense of it or not.

They glare at each other for several seconds. Monk is the 
first one to look away.

		DR. MONK
	Curt Duncan is a classic paranoid-
	schizophrenic. They see themselves 
	as victims, and they always blame 
	other people for the way they are. 
	When Duncan killed the Mandrakis 
	kids, it wasn't an act of hostility 
	against the children but against 
	their parents. He was getting back 
	at his own parents for traumas he 
	suffered in early childhood. The 
	criminal side of Curt Duncan is one 
	of terrible, symbolic vengeance.

		CLIFFORD
		(looking up)
	Assuming he isn't found right away... 
	what will happen to him?

Monk rises and walks to a window.

		DR. MONK
	I think you'll find him. Somebody 
	will find him. He can't function out 
	there. He'll make a mistake.
		(turning to face 
		Clifford)
	This is where he belongs. After six 
	years in here, he's suddenly gone 
	out to confront the world again. I 
	think he's in for a bit of a shock.

Monk looks back out the window.

											CUT TO:

EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON

Not a terribly good section of town. We are looking at the 
nondescript exterior of a bar across the street.

INT. BAR

This is not a slum bar, but it's close. There are a few tables 
and chairs and a pool table in the back. The atmosphere is 
quiet, almost depressed, and the handful of REGULARS here 
are exercising their privacy without having to be alone.

They include: HANK, the bartender, also the owner, who 
absently polishes things with his cloth; TRACY, an unemployed 
woman in her mid-forties who sits at the bar with a drink 
and a cigarette and silently rummages through her current 
feelings -- none of them new or particularly hopeful; a 
COUPLE, probably retired, sitting at the same table they 
come to every afternoon at this time -- him for his beer, 
her for a glass of sweet white wine; and BILL, at the pool 
table, a young man lithe and powerful, minding his own 
business and playing his game of pool with a steady, 
aggressive concentration.

		RETIRED MAN
	Rackin' 'em up today, Bill?

Pause.

		BILL
		(over his shoulder)
	Doin' all right.

The old man smiles stupidly around the room. He racked 'em 
up a little in his day, too. His smile fades as he looks at 
his wife. He takes a sip of beer and lapses into memories.

Then the door opens to the outside and the yellow-orange 
light of late afternoon floods into the bar. The regulars 
turn to glimpse who's coming in. They see the figure of a 
MAN silhouetted in the doorway. He stands there for a long 
moment, not coming in. Finally even Bill interrupts his game 
to turn and look.

		HANK
	C'mon in and shut the door.

The intruder enters, indecisively. The door swings shut behind 
him, plunging the room back into darkness. This man is "a 
little weird", and the regulars continue to stare at him 
until he makes his way to a table near the wall and sits 
down. Then everyone returns to his own thoughts.

		HANK
		(after a moment)
	What'll it be?
		(pause, no answer)
	Hey! What'll it be?

CLOSEUP - INTRUDER

A bit startled, a bit defensive toward the directness of 
this question. It is Curt Duncan. He looks understandably 
harried. He hasn't slept or shaved in at least a couple of 
days, and is wearing regular clothing.

He clears his throat to answer...

		CLIFFORD (O.S.)
	What kind of clothes was he wearing... 
	when he escaped?

											CUT TO:

INT. DR. MONK'S OFFICE -DAY

Clifford is looking through the folder again.

		DR. MONK
	Ordinary street clothes. Not all of 
	our patients have to wear the green 
	Gucci gowns.

		CLIFFORD
	Did he have any money with him?

		DR. MONK
	Probably. But not more than, say, 
	fifty dollars. Some of the patients 
	are given little jobs around the 
	ward, for which they are paid. It's 
	part of the rehabilitation.

Looking down, Clifford pauses over a page in the folder.

CLOSEUP - FACT SHEET IN FOLDER

A page of legibly organized facts and statistics about Curt 
Duncan. One of the entries reads: Guy du Marraux.

		CLIFFORD (O.S.)
		(reading)
	What's Guy du Mar--

		DR. MONK (O.S.)
		(pronouncing it 
		correctly)
	Guy du Marraux syndrom.

BACK TO SCENE

		DR. MONK
	It's a psycho-motor dysfunction.

		CLIFFORD
	Duncan had it?

		DR. MONK
	Only from time to time, which is 
	unusual.

		CLIFFORD
	What is it?

		DR. MONK
	It attacks the nervous system. People 
	suffering from it are irresistibly 
	compelled to utter obscenities, 
	sometimes one, sometimes a whole 
	string of them. They can't control 
	it.

		CLIFFORD
		(somewhat taken aback)
	Are you being serious?

		DR. MONK
	Yeah. Here, I'll give you an example.

He opens a file cabinet drawer, finds a reel of quarter-inch 
magnetic tape and starts to thread it through a recorder on 
his desk.

		DR. MONK
	Duncan never had the twitch that 
	sometimes goes with it. And with 
	Duncan, as I said, the disease would 
	only manifest itself in periods of 
	extreme anxiety. When he was really 
	flipping out, in other words.

There is a pause as Monk fiddles with the tape recorder and 
Clifford looks back down at the folder.

		CLIFFORD
	Duncan was Catholic?

		DR. MONK
	Yeah.
		(beat)
	So am I.

		CLIFFORD
		(mildly surprised)
	That makes three of us.

		DR. MONK
	Is that right? So we all share the 
	same guilt.

Clifford smiles. Monk keeps fiddling.

		DR. MONK
	Here. This is Curt Duncan shortly 
	after he was admitted here in 1972.

Monk turns on the tape recorder as Clifford sits forward in 
his chair to listen.

At first, nothing can be heard. Then there is a click as if 
the machine was turned on in the middle of a conversation:

		DR. MONK (O.S.)
	-- to put the situation right. The 
	hypodermic needles are only used to 
	give you medication that will calm 
	you down. They make you feel good, 
	relaxed. All right?
		(no answer)
	We're not putting anything in your 
	food either. The food is just food.

		DUNCAN (O.S.)
		(extremely agitated)
	No. I don't eat the food. It doesn't 
	taste right.

		DR. MONK
		(to Clifford)
	That's Duncan.

Clifford nods and keeps listening:

		DR. MONK (O.S.)
	Curt, why are you fidgeting? Can't 
	you get comfortable?

		DUNCAN (O.S.)
	No, I'm not comfortable!

		DR. MONK (O.S.)
	Wait a -- Hey!
		(to someone else)
	Hold him down there. Grab him! Never 
	mind the chair!

There are scuffling noises underneath which can be heard, 
heavy breathing and then, getting louder and more furious, 
Duncan falling into the throes of Guy du Marraux.

		DR. MONK (O.S.)
		(periodically 
		interjecting)
	Pull him down... That's right... 
	Just lay him out... Lay him right 
	out... Steady... Pull out his knees...

Finally Monk is heard no more and Duncan continues with the 
frightening verbal torrent of Guy du Marraux.

										DISSOLVE TO:

INT. BAR - LATE AFTERNOON - CLOSEUP - DUNCAN

Sitting at his table inside the bar. He takes a long, noisy 
drink from what looks like a bourbon on the rocks. It tastes 
good, being the first real drink he's had in over six years. 
But Duncan cannot relax enough to enjoy it fully. His eyes 
are ever restlessly, suspiciously moving about.

ANGLE ON BAR

As Bill walks up and stands next to Tracy. Hank moves off to 
get Bill another beer.

Tracy looks up at Bill and smiles. As regulars at the same 
bar, they are loose and comfortable with each other.

		TRACY
		(sotto voce)
	A little action for your game?

		BILL
		(sotto voce)
	What, him?

They both turn and look across the room at Duncan.

POV - DUNCAN

As Bill and Tracy look straight at him over their shoulders 
and then turn back.

ANGLE ON BAR

As they both smile at her joke.

		TRACY
	I wouldn't bet against you.

		BILL
	What's the matter? You don't like me 
	playing with myself?

Tracy grimaces as Hank comes back with Bill's beer. Bill 
picks up the bottle, nods his thanks to Hank and heads back 
to the pool table.

CLOSEUP - DUNCAN

As his eyes follow Bill to the pool table, then come back to 
Tracy at the bar.

POV - DUNCAN

Looking at the back of Tracy. She reaches into her purse.

ON TRACY

She takes her pack of cigarettes from the purse. She pulls 
out a cigarette, taps it lightly on the bar, puts it to her 
lips.

O.S. we hear the sound of a match being struck.

WIDER ANGLE

Duncan is standing beside her holding a lit match. He shoves 
it forward at her. It goes out.

Duncan fumbles for another match as Tracy regards him with 
undisguised repulsion. Duncan gets the second match lit and 
holds it out for her. She accepts the favor and lights her 
cigarette.

Duncan smiles. Tracy nods and turns away. Duncan is still 
holding the burning match for her to blow out. As it doesn't 
look like she's going to, he lets it drop, still lit, to the 
floor.

REACTION SHOT - BARTENDER

He gives a look as if to say, "Jesus, what a fuckin' weirdo".

TWO SHOT - DUNCAN AND TRACY

Pause. Duncan is still smiling at her.

		DUNCAN
	Hi.

No response.

		DUNCAN
	What you been up to?

		TRACY
		(looking at him)
	My own business.
		(beat)
	Thanks for the light. Okay?

The Englishman sits down beside her, but doesn't look at 
her.

Tracy looks away too, determined to ignore him, not to let 
him get into her space.

Duncan coughs. After a long moment, he turns back to her.

		DUNCAN
	Next round's on me.

Tracy keeps her eyes straight ahead, acknowledging nothing.

Pause.

Duncan takes some money from his pocket and lays it on the 
bar, staring at her. Tracy turns to him:

		TRACY
		(annoyed)
	Listen, mister, I've got my own money. 
	So, if you don't mind...

She looks away again. Pause.

		DUNCAN
	After what I been through, I don't 
	mind anything.

Longer pause.

		DUNCAN
	See, that's the whole point. My 
	mind... Your mind... Where do they 
	fit in? You know what I mean?

Tracy abruptly picks up her purse and moves down the bar 
away from him one seat, then another seat.

ANGLE ON ELDERLY COUPLE

They are watching this little spectacle with growing 
curiosity.

ANGLE ON DUNCAN

Still looking at her. By pointing at what she has, he orders 
two more drinks from the Bartender. When they arrive, he 
takes a big swallow from one, picks up the other, stands, 
moves down the bar and sits beside Tracy again.

		DUNCAN
		(setting her drink 
		before her)
	Do you live around here?

		TRACY
	Get offa me!!

REACTION SHOTS

Even Bill now looks up from the pool table. His expression 
darkens.

ANGLE ON BAR

Tracy has clammed up -- her elbows on the bar, head between 
her elbows, arms covering her ears, hands clasped behind her 
neck. Duncan looks at her nervously and starts to talk again:

		DUNCAN
		(rapidly)
	Listen, I didn't mean nothin'. I 
	don't live around here. See -- ?

		BILL (O.S.)
	I think the lady wants to be left 
	alone.

Duncan looks up. Bill enters the frame and stands in front 
of Tracy, confronting Duncan.

CLOSEUP - DUNCAN

Looking up at Bill, his eyes red, his gaze unsteady.

WIDER ANGLE

The air is charged with tension.

		BILL
	I think an apology is in order.

Duncan doesn't know how to handle this. He looks at Bill, 
half shrugs, half smiles.

		BILL
	That the best you can do?

Duncan looks away. A long moment passes.

		BILL
	I think you'd better just move along, 
	pal.

Duncan doesn't move, says nothing. He swallows hard.

		HANK
	He'll be okay now, Bill. He just --

		BILL
	No! I want him out of here!

The bartender steps back, deciding to mind his own business. 
Tracy gets up from her seat and cautiously moves even further 
down the bar.

		BILL
		(to Duncan)
	Go on, beat it.

They glare at each other. The longer Duncan sits there without 
moving, without saying anything, the angrier Bill gets.

REACTION SHOTS

As the tension builds.

ANGLE ON BAR

Duncan looks away.

		BILL
	I'm not going to say it again, mister.

Duncan reaches for his drink, but Bill reacts quicker. With 
a swipe of his hand, he knocks the glass off the bar, and it 
shatters on the floor behind the bar.

Duncan sits there, stunned, not looking up. After a long 
moment, Duncan coughs. Then he turns and looks at Bill. He 
purses his lips. It looks like a nervous facial movement. 
Then suddenly, Duncan spits at Bill, hitting him square in 
the face.

Before anyone can register what's happened, Bill lunges at 
Duncan, knocking him clean off the barstool and onto the 
floor.

The fight is fast, vicious and one-sided from the very start. 
Pinned to the floor on his back, Duncan flails his arms 
ineffectually like a panicked insect as Bill holds him in 
place with a left-handed grip on the collar while his powerful 
right arm, pumping up and down like a piston, pounds into 
Duncan's face time and time again.

Duncan's screams diminish into pathetic, sickening groans 
and the others in the bar are compelled to avert their eyes 
from this brutal spectacle.

Hank has picked up a phone from beneath the bar and is dialing 
a number. He turns away from the fight to talk.

Then, as suddenly as Bill first sprang at Duncan, he leaps 
to his feet and turns to the bar. He reaches over and grabs 
the phone from Hank, slamming it down into the cradle.

		BILL
	Who're you calling?

Bill takes the cloth from the bar and vigorously wipes his 
face off. He snaps his fingers and points to a row of bottles 
on a shelf behind the bar. Hank quickly hands him a bottle. 
Bill pours himself a shot and downs it, fast. He is still 
charged with adrenaline and he takes two more shots in rapid 
succession, spilling the alcohol on the bar and on himself.

As Bill picks up the cloth to wipe himself off again, Tracy 
stands up and quickly walks out of the bar, slamming the 
door behind her.

		BILL
		(calling after her)
	You're welcome, baby!

Then he throws down the cloth, picks up the bottle, turns 
and, standing over Duncan's inert form, empties half the 
bottle onto him. He sets the bottle back on the bar. He grabs 
Duncan and, half dragging, hurries him out the back door and 
throws him into the alley where Duncan falls in a heap.

Bill storms back up to the bar and pours himself another 
drink.

		BILL
		(to Hank)
	Okay?

Hank just looks at him, doesn't answer. At the wife's silent 
insistence, the elderly couple stand up to go.

		OLD MAN
	Good riddance to bad rubbish, eh, 
	Bill?

Bill doesn't answer and the couple quietly leave.

		HANK
		(apologetic)
	A fight breaks out, there's gonna be 
	damages. Insurance company doesn't 
	pay without a police report...

		BILL
	You see any damages?

Hank lowers his gaze to the floor. Bill finishes his drink. 
He is still very hopped up. He pulls a few dollars from his 
wallet and drops them on the counter.

		BILL
	See ya 'round.

He turns and strides out of the bar.

CAMERA HOLDS for a beat on Hank alone now in his empty 
establishment. The phone starts to ring, presumably the police 
calling back.

After several rings, Hank picks up the phone and listens.

		HANK
		(into phone)
	No, it's over now...

										DISSOLVE TO:

INT. LT. GARBER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

All the lights are out inside the house, but we should just 
be able to see that we are in the hall, looking at the front 
door. Footsteps approach on the walk outside. A key slips 
into the lock...

Inside the house we can hear faint whispering. Someone is 
moving about in the darkness. Then the door swings open and 
the shadowy figure of a MAN crosses the threshold. He stops 
just inside.

		MAN
		(calling out)
	Donna. Donna! Hey!
		(under his breath)
	What the hell -- !

Suddenly the lights come on and a chorus of voices cry out, 
"SURPRISE!"

A broad smile breaks across the man's face. We may recognize 
him as the cop from six years ago -- Charles Garber. Today 
he is a lieutenant on the force and dresses casually for 
work, usually in slacks, turtleneck and jacket.

		GARBER
		(genuinely surprised)
	What is all this?!

		SCATTERED VOICES
	Happy birthday, Charlie!

Garber looks sheepishly at his hand holding the pistol he'd 
drawn just before the lights came up.

		WOMAN'S VOICE
	Look at him!

		MAN'S VOICE
	Don't shoot us, Charlie!

		GARBER
		(chagrined)
	How was I supposed to know?

Everybody starts to laugh, including Garber as he returns 
the pistol to his shoulder holster.

ANGLE ON DONNA

Garber's wife. She comes out of the kitchen carrying a 
birthday cake with lit candles and makes her way through the 
crowd of GUESTS singing "Happy Birthday".

Everyone joins in as Donna moves forward and stands beside 
her husband. Clifford is one of the guests. He has his arm 
around a young BLOND who is sort of pretty despite her 
tacky/plastic appearance.

When the song is over, Garber blows out the candles and hugs 
and kisses his wife. Everybody cheers.

INT. GARBER'S HOUSE - STAIRWAY - SEVERAL HOURS LATER

The party is still in full swing. Garber is following Clifford 
up the stairs. They are both fairly loaded by now.

Garber, in particular, has reached that stage of inebriation 
where standing still is pretty hard to do.

		GARBER
	Will you tell me what this is about, 
	Cliff?

		CLIFFORD
	Yeah, in a minute.

		GARBER
	I don't think I can take any more of 
	these surprises.

INT. A BEDROOM

As Clifford and Garber enter. Garber turns on a light as 
Clifford closes the door, shutting out the sounds of the 
party below.

		GARBER
	Okay now, what's the big deal?

		CLIFFORD
	Stand still. I want you to remember 
	this in the morning.

		GARBER
	If you want me to remember something 
	in the morning, then tell it to me 
	in the morning.

Garber half comically turns to go. Clifford stops him.

		CLIFFORD
	Charlie, come on.

ANGLE ON CORNER OF BEDROOM

A BABY between a year and two years old is lying in a crib. 
It opens its eyes and starts looking around.

		GARBER (O.S.)
	All right, all right. What is it? 
	You're getting married.

		CLIFFORD
	No. I got a job today, tracking 
	someone.

TWO SHOT - CLIFFORD &amp; GARBER

Garber, still moving restlessly, pats his friend on the 
shoulder.

		GARBER
	That's great, Cliff; I'm sure you'll 
	find your man.

		CLIFFORD
	It's Curt Duncan.

Garber stops suddenly, stunned. In an instant, he has become 
stone sober.

		GARBER
	What?

ANGLE ON BABY

Kicking and wiggling about.

		CLIFFORD (O.S.)
	You didn't know he got out?

The baby opens its mouth and starts to cry.

TWO SHOT - CLIFFORD &amp; GARBER

Garber glances over his shoulder at the baby, then turns 
back to Clifford.

		CLIFFORD
	I need your cooperation on this one.

		GARBER
	Sure. Anything.

											CUT TO:

EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

It is late. The block is virtually deserted. Across the street 
is the exterior of a bar -- the same bar Duncan was in 
earlier. Some PEOPLE are coming out of the bar. It must be 
near closing time. The people turn left and walk away down 
the sidewalk. Their voices diminish. Pause.

A car passes. Then the door to the bar opens again and a 
woman comes out onto the sidewalk. It is Tracy. She turns to 
the right and starts to walk away.

CLOSEUP - DUNCAN

He is standing in shadows across the street, watching her.

EXT. TRACY ON STREET - NIGHT

A series of shots of Tracy walking home. The CAMERA remains 
consistently behind her or off to one side, sometimes DOLLYING 
with her behind a row of parked cars, sometimes picking up 
her passing reflection in a darkened store window.

The impression this gives is unmistakable. Curt Duncan is 
following her. We do not see him, we do not hear him, yet we 
know he is there. Often we can sense that the very angle 
from which we see Tracy is his POV.

But Tracy is aware of nothing. We know this when the CAMERA 
begins to move in front of her, once more becoming an 
impersonal observer of her walk homeward, to safety.

Tension mounts as we start to expect that Duncan will jump 
out at her from every alley and recessed doorway she passes. 
But he doesn't.

Finally, Tracy walks up to the CAMERA at the end of a block 
and turns a corner; but the CAMERA HOLDS on the dark street 
she has just come up. We hear a cough which confirms that 
Duncan is lurking somewhere in the shadows.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Tracy walks up the steps and enters the apartment.

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING

Tracy steps into the elevator. The doors close. CAMERA HOLDS 
on the elevator and watches the lights above it travel from 
one to six.

O.S. we hear the door to the apartment building open and 
close.

INT. SIXTH FLOOR

Tracy steps out of the elevator and walks down the hall to 
her door. She fumbles through her purse for keys, then bends 
over the lock to let herself in.

Behind her down the hall, Duncan appears. He watches her, 
starts to move silently forward. Tracy gets the door open, 
then turns and sees him. Duncan stops.

		TRACY
	Oh, it's you!
		(beat)
	What do you want?

		DUNCAN
		(moving forward)
	...Came to apologize. I...

		TRACY
	Look, I'm the one who should be sorry. 
	I didn't want that to happen.
		(she sees his face; 
		shudders)
	Oh, God! Look at you. Are you all 
	right.

Duncan half shrugs, half smiles. Tracy edges into her door-
way. Duncan stands opposite her.

		DUNCAN
	I'm new in town. Don't know anybody...

		TRACY
		(uncomfortable)
	Where're you from?

		DUNCAN
		(coughs)
	New York. Ever been there?

		TRACY
	Sure. Sure I've been there.

They look at each other. Duncan coughs again.

		DUNCAN
	Kind of a mean place to be. Everyone 
	cold, unfriendly...

Inside Tracy's apartment, the telephone rings. Tracy turns 
vaguely, indecisively, and goes to answer it.

		TRACY
		(over her shoulder)
	Excuse me.

She disappears into the apartment. O.S. she picks up the 
ringing phone.

		TRACY (O.S.)
	Hello?...

INT. TRACY'S APARTMENT

As she sits with the telephone.

		TRACY
		(nervous)
	...No, I just got in... I don't know 
	if I can... Listen, I can't talk 
	now. Can I call you back?... Okay... 
	Goodbye.

She hangs up the phone, stands and turns back toward the 
door. Duncan is standing right behind her.

		DUNCAN
	I'm not from New York, actually. But 
	I'm very, very far from home.

He sits down.

		TRACY
	Look, you can't come in here.

Duncan looks at her for a moment, then looks about the 
apartment.

		DUNCAN
		(mumbling)
	I thought we might get some coffee. 
	Can I buy you -- ?

		TRACY
	I don't think so.

		DUNCAN
	Someplace nearby?

		TRACY
	Not tonight. You'd better go.

		DUNCAN
	I got no place to go.

		TRACY
		(anxious)
	You can't --

		DUNCAN
	Just, just a little coffee?

		TRACY
	Maybe tomorrow.

		DUNCAN
	Okay, tomorrow. When?

		TRACY
	I said maybe. I don't know.
		(beat)
	Listen, I'm sorry about this 
	afternoon. I really am. All right? 
	That was my boyfriend on the phone. 
	He's coming over. So please leave. 
	Now.

Duncan doesn't move. He smiles at her.

		DUNCAN
	I like you.

		TRACY
		(her voice rising)
	Look, do you want me to call the 
	cops?

		DUNCAN
		(standing)
	It's okay. It's okay.

He backs to the doorway and pauses.

		DUNCAN
	I'll see you later... sometime. I 
	still want to buy you that drink.

He steps into the hall. Tracy closes the front door and bolts 
it. She turns, leans against it and sighs.

Outside the door, Duncan's footsteps move down the hall, 
pause, then come back to the door. A moment passes. Then 
there is a faint knocking on the door. Tracy doesn't move. 
The knocking comes again, a little louder this time. Tracy 
stands and waits, scarcely breathing. After another long 
moment, the footsteps finally move away.

											CUT TO:

EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

A car pulls into the parking lot behind the station. Clifford 
and Garber get out and walk into the building.

INT. POLICE STATION

Clifford and Garber walk down a hallway. Uniformed POLICEMEN 
walk to and fro around them.

		CLIFFORD
	Jesus, I don't recognize anybody.

		GARBER
	Three years is a long time in a place 
	like this.

		CLIFFORD
	Three and a half.

Garber stops at the WATCH COMMANDER'S desk and picks up some 
paperwork. The WC looks up briefly and sees Clifford.

		WC
	Hiya, Cliff. Howya doin'?

The WC looks down again. Three and a half years mean nothing 
to him.

		CLIFFORD
		(taken aback)
	Hi...

He can't remember the man's name. Garber smiles at him and 
they continue walking.

		GARBER
	How long will you be here?

		CLIFFORD
	Depends on how lucky I get.
		(beat)
	I'll only be coming around once, 
	maybe twice a week.

		GARBER
	You want to use your old desk? 
	Someplace to sit down?

		CLIFFORD
		(surprised)
	Is it vacant?

INT. OFFICE - POLICE STATION

A. Clifford and Garber appear in the doorway. Clifford enters, 
walks up to his old desk, opens some of the drawers -- they 
are empty -- sits down in his old chair, smiles at Garber.

B. We see Clifford opening a file cabinet and taking out a 
folder stuffed with notices and reports --

C. Clifford standing beside a Xerox machine running off a 
copy of something --

D. Clifford standing in a hallway talking to a PATROLMAN. 
Clifford has a legal pad with him and is jotting something 
down on it as the patrolman speaks --

E. Clifford at his desk, making notes on the legal pad --

F. Garber is at his desk, on the phone, Clifford appears in 
the doorway carrying his legal pad. He waves goodbye to Garber 
who nods in response.

											CUT TO:

INT. LOBBY OF A FLOPHOUSE HOTEL

Clifford questions the DESK CLERK. He shows the clerk a photo 
of Duncan taken some years ago in the mental institution. 
The clerk shakes his head and starts to hand the picture 
back when Clifford motions for him to keep it. As Clifford 
leaves, the clerk turns the picture over...

CLOSEUP - BACK OF PICTURE

Revealing Clifford's name and phone numbers, and a twenty 
dollar bill paperclipped to the back of the picture --

EXT. STREET

As Clifford pulls his car up to the curb, then consults his 
legal pad --

CLOSEUP - LEGAL PAD

The top three addresses are crossed out. Clifford underlines 
the fourth --

BACK TO SCENE

Clifford looks up from the pad to a bar he has pulled up in 
front of -- the bar Duncan was in. It bears the address 
Clifford has just underlined. Clifford gets out of his car 
and walks up to the bar. A "Closed" sign is displayed in the 
window. Clifford knocks on the door. After a moment, Hank 
opens the door.

											CUT TO:

INT. LAUNDROMAT - DAY

There are only a few CUSTOMERS sitting around, waiting for 
their wash. A BUM is stretched out on his back across one of 
the tables like a corpse awaiting autopsy. This is CHEATER.

A MAINTENANCE MAN in grey work clothes enters from the back. 
He opens a broom closet, takes out a bucket and mop and rolls 
them toward the front of the laundromat. He stops at Cheater's 
table and shakes him hard.

		MAINTENANCE MAN
	Okay, man, move it out. Let's go.

		CHEATER
	Wha -- ?

Cheater sits up and starts to pull himself together. An OLD 
WOMAN sitting against the wall points down one of the aisles 
of washing machines and says to the maintenance man:

		OLD WOMAN
	There's another one down there.

The maintenance man goes to the end of the aisle and looks 
down into the nook created by the absence of one of the 
washing machines.

		MAINTENANCE MAN
	Hey!

He nudges at whatever's inside the nook with his foot.

		MAINTENANCE MAN
		(nudging again)
	Come on, bright eyes. Wake up. Wake -- 
	Jesus Christ! What happened to you?

ANGLE ON NOOK

As Curt Duncan raises his head into the light and looks up 
at the maintenance man. Overnight, his face has swollen 
considerably and a bright yellow and purple discoloring around 
his bruises has emerged.

		MAINTENANCE MAN (O.S.)
	You get hit by a truck or what?

He bends over and helps pull Duncan to his feet.

WIDER ANGLE

As the maintenance man guides Duncan to the door.

		MAINTENANCE MAN
	I'm sorry, man, but you can't stay 
	in here. Go out to the park, lay in 
	the sunshine. You'll feel better. 
	Okay?

Duncan goes out the door. The maintenance man turns and sees 
Cheater stretched out again on the table.

		MAINTENANCE MAN
	God bless it! Hey!

He pulls Cheater off the table and pushes him to the door.

		MAINTENANCE MAN
	Out. Out. Out. Out. Out.

EXT. LAUNDROMAT

As Cheater is pushed out onto the sidewalk.

		CHEATER
		(angry)
	All right! All right!

He straightens his rags indignantly, then looks at Duncan 
and grins.

		CHEATER
	Whaddya say, pardner. I'm dry as a 
	bone. You got any money?

Duncan looks at Cheater distrustfully and shakes his head.

		CHEATER
	You neither, huh?
		(with a laugh)
	My name is Morgan, but it ain't J.P. 
	Guess I better go to work. Take 'er 
	easy now, pardner.

Cheater shuffles off in one direction. Duncan turns and goes 
in the other.

											CUT TO:

INT. TRACY'S APARTMENT - DAY

A knock at the front door. After a moment, Tracy comes into 
the front hallway and, crossing to the door, stubs her toe 
on the open closet door. She swears under her breath and 
angrily slams the closet door shut. Then, grabbing her injured 
toe, she hops to the front door.

		TRACY
	Who is it?

		CLIFFORD (O.S.)
	My name's John Clifford. I'm a private 
	investigator.

		TRACY
	A what?

		CLIFFORD (O.S.)
	A private detective.

Pause.

		TRACY
	What do you want with me?

		CLIFFORD (O.S.)
	I'd just like to talk, ask a few 
	questions.

		TRACY
	I've got nothing to say about anything 
	or anybody.

Pause.

		CLIFFORD (O.S.)
	Listen, lady, I can be back in thirty 
	minutes with a search warrant and a 
	handful of cops, and I can probably 
	have you arrested, whether or not 
	the charges would stick. Now do you 
	want to let me in and talk?

		TRACY
	Have you got a badge?

		CLIFFORD (O.S.)
	I'll show you a badge when you open 
	the goddamn door!

Tracy unbolts the door and opens it. Clifford walks right in 
and closes the door behind him.

		CLIFFORD
	I don't carry a badge. I'm issued a 
	license, a piece of paper, and I 
	left it at home. You're Tracy Fuller?

Tracy nods.

		CLIFFORD
	Can we sit down?

Tracy leads him into the living room. They sit. Clifford 
gives her a picture.

		CLIFFORD
	Do you recognize this man?

		TRACY
	Why?

Clifford lets out a sigh of frustration, realizing that this 
woman will continue to be difficult.

		CLIFFORD
	He's escaped from the insane asylum. 
	In 1972, he murdered two children... 
	broke into a house and found them 
	asleep in bed. It was a little boy, 
	five an a half, and a little three-
	year-old girl. After the coroner's 
	investigation, their bodies were 
	taken to the mortuary, where the 
	undertaker took one look at them and 
	said he couldn't have their bodies 
	reconstructed for the funeral without 
	six days of steady work. Then he 
	asked what had been the murder weapon, 
	because looking at the mess in front 
	of him, he couldn't imagine what had 
	been used. The coroner told him there 
	had been no murder weapon. The killer 
	had used only his hands.
		(beat)
	The undertaker went to work and had 
	them done in four.

The picture falls out of Tracy's hands. She is stunned to 
the point of nausea.

		CLIFFORD
	What's the matter?

		TRACY
		(barely able to say 
		it)
	He's been here.

EXT. STREET

Duncan is standing on the sidewalk huddled close to a wall. 
He is looking up at Tracy's apartment building across the 
street.

POV - DUNCAN

Traveling up the wall of the building to the open window of 
Tracy's apartment on the sixth floor. SLOW ZOOM IN:

		CLIFFORD (O.S.)
	Do you think he'll try to see you 
	again?

		TRACY (O.S.)
	I don't know. He said he had no place 
	else to go.

INT. TRACY'S APARTMENT

		CLIFFORD
	Let's play it safe. Let's assume 
	that he will.

CLOSEUP - TRACY

Reacting to this possibility.

		CLIFFORD (O.S.)
	Will you work with me?

She nods, hesitantly.

EXT. STREET

Duncan turns up an alley across the street from Tracy's 
apartment building and disappears.

Sound over: knocking on a door.

											CUT TO:

EXT. BAR - DAY

Clifford is standing at the door. The "Closed" sign still 
hangs in the window. The door opens, and Hank sticks his 
head out.

		HANK
	You again?

		CLIFFORD
	What are your hours tonight?

		HANK
	No hours. Bar's closed on Mondays.

		CLIFFORD
	I want you to be open if that's 
	possible.

		HANK
		(closing the door)
	No way. Monday's my night off. Come 
	back tomorr...

Clifford violently pushes the door open. The bartender backs 
off, surprised.

		CLIFFORD
		(through clenched 
		teeth)
	This is tomorrow! Now what are your 
	hours?

											CUT TO:

INT. LT. GARBER'S OFFICE - DAY

Garber is sitting behind his desk as Clifford walks in.

		GARBER
		(looking up)
	Any luck?

		CLIFFORD
	I've come to say goodbye, and thank 
	you.

		GARBER
	You found him?

		CLIFFORD
	I think so.

		GARBER
	Where?

Pause.

		CLIFFORD
	From here on, I go it alone.

		GARBER
	What's the point of chancing it, 
	Cliff? We'll let you take the credit.

		CLIFFORD
	No.

Pause. Clifford sits down.

		CLIFFORD
	I'm going to kill him, Charlie.

Garber leans forward in his chair and stares at Clifford. A 
long moment passes. A button on the lieutenant's phone lights 
up and the intercom buzzes. Garber doesn't even look down at 
it. The button flashes on and off, on and off. Finally it 
stops.

		CLIFFORD
	The closer I get to this guy, the 
	more I... It gets to me. I don't 
	know...

		GARBER
	I think you'd better go on home, 
	Cliff. You've fallen in.

		CLIFFORD
	No. Not this time. This is the case 
	that makes up for a whole career. If 
	you can't understand it now, you 
	will in a few years.

Pause. Garber considers another tack and follows it.

		GARBER
	What part does money play in all 
	this? Play straight with me.

Clifford is stunned by the question, but he tries to be 
casual.

		CLIFFORD
		(shrugging)
	For what I'm being paid, it's not 
	out of line.

		GARBER
	Who's hired you for this?

Clifford glares at his friend and doesn't answer.

		GARBER
		(cynically)
	So you're a hitman now.

		CLIFFORD
		(passionately)
	He murdered two kids in cold blood. 
	You were there, too.

Garber doesn't have to be reminded of his own feelings. He 
doesn't pursue the argument.

		GARBER
	You could get busted.

		CLIFFORD
	I understand that.

		GARBER
	What are you going to use?

		CLIFFORD
	Jimmy needles.

Garber nods slowly, considering it a good choice of weapons 
at least.

		GARBER
	You're stretching our friendship, 
	Cliff. If you blow this at all --

		CLIFFORD
	You'll never hear from me again.

Garber looks away for a moment. When he looks back, he just 
shrugs his shoulders, "washes his hands".

		GARBER
	Take your time. Do it right.

		CLIFFORD
	Don't worry.

		GARBER
	Do you need any help preparing for 
	this thing?

		CLIFFORD
		(standing up)
	I'm ready. I'm just trying to think 
	where he could be in the meantime.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A few customers sit quietly minding their own business. A 
WAITRESS leans near the cash register at one end of the 
counter. A transistor radio plays country music blues. The 
waitress looks up as somebody enters.

		WAITRESS
	What happened to you?

		DUNCAN (O.S.)
	Coffee.

It is Duncan. He moves to the counter and sits.

		WAITRESS
	You get mugged?

		DUNCAN
	Black.

Snubbed, the waitress comes back and sets the cup in front 
of him. She looks down at the change on the counter. There 
isn't enough.

		WAITRESS
	Coffee's twenty-seven.

Duncan looks up at her resentfully.

		WAITRESS
		(pulling away the cup)
	Coffee's twenty-seven cents. Ya got 
	it or don't ya?

Duncan glares at her. He doesn't have it.

		WAITRESS
	Okay, buster, one cup. On the house.

She pushes the cup back to him. Some of the coffee spills 
onto the counter.

		WAITRESS
	Drink it and be on your way.

Duncan slowly reaches for the cup, raises it to his lips.

		WAITRESS
	You're welcome.

Duncan stops, sets the cup down, pushes it away from him and 
slowly rises from his seat.

		DUNCAN
	No, thank you.

Duncan and the waitress stand face to face, shooting darts 
at each other. Then a MAN sitting two seats away reaches 
over and places a quarter on the counter between them.

The waitress looks at the man irritatedly, then picks up the 
money and moves away.

Duncan slowly sits down again. He pulls the cup back to 
himself, then turns and looks at the man for a long moment, 
unable to express his gratitude.

EXT. CITY STREETS - DUSK

A series of shots of BUMS, "homeless persons", hanging out, 
in alleys, in the doorways of old buildings, sitting on the 
sidewalk in front of liquor stores.

Then we see Duncan, alone but looking no different from the 
others. He is panhandling PASSERSBY, without much success. 
We see him fall into a fit of coughing that incapacitates 
him for several seconds. He's obviously getting sicker.

We lose sight of Duncan as our MONTAGE continues. We see 
Clifford talking to a BUM, then another. He is passing the 
time combing the streets in the neighborhood of the bar.

PARK - DUSK

A handful of BUMS are sitting together on the grass passing 
a bottle in a brown paper bag. Duncan is not among them, but 
Cheater is there, sitting at the end of the line.

CAMERA PANS from one bum to the next as the bottle is passed. 
By the time it gets to Cheater, it is empty. Cheater looks 
as if he's about to cry like a baby when a hand enters the 
frame from the other side -- the hand holding out to Cheater 
a full bottle of wine. Cheater takes the bottle and looks up 
gratefully... to see John Clifford standing beside him.

		CHEATER
	Well! I can't say much for your 
	protocol, but your timing's dead on. 
	Here's to you, pardner.

Cheater takes a long drink, then passes the bottle back down 
the line.

		CLIFFORD
		(to all the bums)
	I'm looking for an old buddy of mine, 
	English fella. Name's Crazy Curt. 
	Any of you guys seen him?

Nobody responds.

		CLIFFORD
	I owe him some money.

		CHEATER
	Aaahh. Show me an honest man...

		CLIFFORD
		(gesturing)
	Stands about so. Brown hair. Face 
	kind of banged up. Was in an accident.

		CHEATER
	Oh, yeah? I was just with that guy, 
	not more'n an hour ago. Looked bad. 
	Crazy Curt, huh?

		CLIFFORD
	Where?

Cheater scratches his head, and glances anxiously down the 
line.

		CHEATER
	Hell, I can't remember. Prob'bly see 
	him again though. Tell you what. You 
	leave the money with me, I'll see he 
	gets it... as a favor to you.

Clifford shakes his head.

		CLIFFORD
	I have to talk to him.

		CHEATER
	Whatsa matter? You don't trust me? 
	I'll have you know I used to be a 
	college professor. We can work 
	together.

Clifford stands to go. The bottle comes back to Cheater, 
three-quarters down.

		CLIFFORD
	Sure. Keep the bottle. I'll be back.

		CHEATER
	"Long life to the grape! For when 
	summer is flown, The age of our nectar 
	Shall gladden our own." That's 
	Shelley, you know.

Clifford is gone. Cheater takes a long drink and almost 
forgets that Clifford was ever there.

INT. CLIFFORD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Clifford is "suiting up" for his night's work. He is dressed 
casually -- blue jeans, shirt open at the neck, sports jacket, 
Adidas running shoes. He looks at himself in the mirror, is 
satisfied. Then he picks up from the dresser two awl-like 
instruments with short handles and long, glistening tapered 
needlepoints -- his weapons. He slides them into a leather 
sheath inside his jacket and turns to go.

											CUT TO:

EXT. BAR - NIGHT

It is lit up inside. The bar is open for business. Across 
the street in a dark space between two buildings, Duncan is 
waiting, watching the front door of the bar to see who comes 
out.

INT. BAR

The place is empty but for Hank who half watches the 
television over the bar, and Tracy who sits alone in a corner. 
Several moments pass as both of them sit and wait.

Then, the front door starts to swing open. Someone is coming 
in. Tracy and Hank both glance nervously toward the door.

A MAN'S head peeks in. He is somewhere in his forties, a 
regular customer.

		CUSTOMER
	Hey, Hank, what're you doing open 
	tonight?

		HANK
		(relaxing)
	Trying to make a buck.

The customer walks up to the bar, sits down and talks quietly 
with Hank.

Tracy looks nervously at her wristwatch. She stubs out her 
cigarette, takes one last gulp of her drink and stands up to 
go.

She walks to the bar, opens her purse and reaches inside.

		HANK
	Keep it, honey. My treat.

They exchange a meaningful look. Then she heads for the door.

		CUSTOMER
		(under his breath)
	That how you make a buck?

EXT. BAR

Tracy looks up and down the street, hoping to see Clifford 
somewhere, afraid of glimpsing Duncan instead. Then she starts 
walking quickly homeward.

EXT. STREETS

Following Tracy to her apartment. We pick up Clifford now, 
and we cut back and forth between the two of them -- her 
walking quickly, never looking back, and him sneaking along 
several hundred feet behind her, looking everywhere for 
Duncan, whom we never see.

EXT. TRACY'S APARTMENT

She walks up the steps and enters.

INT. SIXTH FLOOR

Tracy steps off the elevator and goes to her door. She fumbles 
through her purse for the key. Then she hears footsteps on 
the stairs. She turns. It's Clifford.

		CLIFFORD
		(coming forward: half-
		whispering)
	No luck. You see him?

Tracy shakes her head.

		CLIFFORD
	He still could be out there, though.

		TRACY
		(softly)
	Oh, God...

She is starting to come apart, and she suddenly leans on 
Clifford for support.

		CLIFFORD
	Are you all right?

Tracy stands there for several seconds to regain control of 
herself. Then she steps away and turns back to the door.

		TRACY
	I'm okay.

		CLIFFORD
	I'm going to hang around outside for 
	awhile. I'll be back on and off again 
	all night.

Tracy gets the door unlocked. She pushes it open.

INT. TRACY'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL

Tracy steps in. Clifford stays in the doorway. They are still 
whispering.

		CLIFFORD
	Are you sure you're okay?

		TRACY
	I'm fine.

		CLIFFORD
	All right. Bolt your door. Don't let 
	anybody in, no matter what.

		TRACY
	Okay.

		CLIFFORD
	I'll be seeing you.
		(starts to move off; 
		comes back)
	Listen. Thanks.

		TRACY
	Sure.

Tracy closes the door and throws the bolt. Then she walks 
into the apartment and out of frame. CAMERA STAYS in the 
hallway. We can hear Tracy moving about O.S.

Then, as if on its own, the door to the hall closet slowly 
swings open...

...until we can see Duncan standing inside the closet.

INT. KITCHEN

Tracy is putting some coffee on. Then she removes her coat 
and walks out of the kitchen.

INT. FRONT HALL

Tracy goes up to the closet with her coat. The door is closed. 
She opens it. She hangs up her coat and closes the door again. 
Then she turns and starts walking out of the hallway to the 
living room.

As she is rounding the corner into the living room, she walks 
right into Duncan. She barely has time to gasp before he 
clamps his hand over her mouth and pushes her against the 
wall.

		DUNCAN
		(urgent whisper)
	I just have to talk to you.
		(pathetically)
	I want you to be my friend.

As she isn't struggling, he starts to loosen up on her.

		DUNCAN
	Please...

He takes his hand away from her mouth, lets go of her, and 
slowly, cautiously steps back. Tracy looks at him for a 
breathless moment, her eyes wild with fear. Then she screams.

Duncan jumps back, stunned, frightened and confused. Tracy 
doesn't move. She just keeps screaming hysterically.

EXT. STREET

Tracy's screams carry out into the night as Clifford races 
across the street and into the apartment building.

INT. TRACY'S APARTMENT

Duncan runs to a window, throws it open and climbs out onto 
the fire escape.

INTERCUT - APARTMENT STAIRS AND FIRE ESCAPE

As Clifford bounds up the stairs, flight after flight, and 
Duncan tears down the fire escape.

INT. SIXTH FLOOR

The screaming has stopped when Clifford reaches Tracy's door. 
He grabs the doorknob and heaves himself against the door. 
It's bolted shut.

Clifford pulls one of the needles from his jacket and hammers 
it into the lock. The bolt springs and Clifford runs into 
the apartment.

INT. TRACY'S APARTMENT

As Clifford bursts in. Tracy gestures toward the window. 
Clifford runs to it and sticks his head out.

POV - CLIFFORD

Duncan is gone.

BACK TO SCENE

Clifford runs to a window on another wall and looks out onto 
the street.

POV - CLIFFORD

No sign of the Englishman.

BACK TO SCENE

Clifford runs out of the apartment, yanking his needle from 
the lock as he passes the door, and charges back down the 
stairs.

Tracy moves to the door and closes it. She is breathing 
heavily.

O.S. we hear the angry sizzle of coffee spilling onto the 
hot stove, as Tracy goes to get it.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING

Clifford comes out, looks around and moves rapidly up the 
street.

EXT. A STREET

Duncan is hurrying along, dodging in and out of people, trying 
to move quickly but not draw attention to himself...

EXT. ANOTHER STREET

Clifford is travelling along the sidewalk, crossing the 
street, looking everywhere...

EXT. ALLEYWAY

Duncan is running up the alley. He comes to a stop beside 
some piled up trash cans. He leans against the brick wall of 
the building, huffing and puffing. He is frightened, but he 
feels safe for now. He slowly slides down the wall to the 
ground...

									FLASH BACK TO:

INT. MENTAL HOSPITAL - DAY

Duncan is curled up in the corner of a bare cell with padded 
walls. He is in a strait-jacket. His head is shaved. We can't 
tell what he is thinking, except that he's obviously deeply 
frightened and cannot understand what's happening to him.

											CUT TO:

INT. A ROOM - NIGHT

This is the children's bedroom in Dr. Mandrakis' house of 
six years ago. It is dark. Two small beds occupy one corner 
of the room. We can see two small lumps on the beds, but no 
more.

Duncan sits in the foreground with a telephone on his lap. 
He is dialing a number. The phone rings three times before 
it is answered -- or rather, picked up, because there is no 
voice on the other end. After several seconds the phone is 
hung up.

Duncan hangs up and thinks for a moment. He picks up the 
phone and dials again. This time he gets a busy signal. He 
hangs up, stands and goes to the door. He opens it slowly, 
peers out. Jill's voice can be heard faintly talking to the 
operator, asking for the police.

Duncan closes the door and comes back into the room, mumbling. 
He goes to the window, looks out. Then he goes to the 
children's beds.

CLOSEUP - DUNCAN

As he raises the covers and stares down into the CAMERA.

											CUT TO:

EXT. DECK OF A SHIP - MORNING

A freighter, broad and low, arduously cuts through the water. 
Early morning mist hangs over the deck which is empty but 
for a lone FIGURE standing on the prow.

MIDDLE SHOT - LONE FIGURE

It is Curt Duncan. He is looking out over the front of the 
ship. Another SEAMAN comes up behind him and claps him on 
the shoulder.

		SEAMAN
	So this will be your first time?
		(laughs)
	An old salt like you?

Duncan moves away, wanting to be left alone.

		SEAMAN
		(still laughing; 
		slightly punchy)
	You'll love it here. It's where they 
	make the bombs. It's where they make 
	the planes that carry the bombs; the 
	planes we saw over Singapore and 
	Manila.

He walks away laughing.

		SEAMAN
	There she is. That's America.

DUNCAN'S POV

The coast of Southern California emerges through the mist. A 
foghorn blows somewhere in the distance.

CLOSE-UP - DUNCAN

As he peers ahead with inscrutable interest.

											CUT TO:

INT. ANOTHER ROOM - NIGHT

Dark. A little BOY is lying in bed, apparently asleep. This 
is Curt Duncan as a child.

Some voices approach in the hallway outside the bedroom. 
They are gruff, with heavy English accents, but subdued; a 
MAN and a WOMAN, well into middle-age.

The boy's eyes open as he listens:

		MAN (O.S.)
	What's the matter?

		WOMAN (O.S.)
	Save it for later. Let's go out and 
	get some food.

		MAN (O.S.)
	What about the lad? You can't leave 
	him.

		WOMAN (O.S.)
	Curt's asleep. He'll never know we're 
	gone.

From outside, a key enters the lock of the bedroom door and 
turns. The bolt slips and the door is securely shut.

The boy sits up in bed, apprehensive. In TIGHT SHOTS of the 
floor we see a rat come out from under the bed, then another. 
They make "chit-chit" noises as they begin to explore. One 
of them maybe goes up on its hind legs and nibbles on the 
bedpost. Then we see two more rats appear.

We go for a TIGHT SHOT of the boy on top of the bed. The 
"chit-chit" noises grow steadily louder as the boy's 
apprehension turns to fear, then to terror. The boy starts 
to whimper.

Suddenly, we cut back to a WIDE SHOT of the room. The floor 
is crawling with rats, hundreds of them. The "chit-chit" 
rises to practically a roar as the boy, alone on top of the 
bed, begins to wail.

The room seems to darken, and the boy becomes just a little 
white speck in it. The focus is turned. The picture becomes 
a black and white blur.

										DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT - THE PRESENT

At first all that can be seen is a white blur against a black 
screen. The previous sound of a boy crying increases. Then 
the blur grows larger, coming more into focus as the entire 
screen image moves toward normal definition. Finally, we 
know we are back in the alleyway, that it is night, and that 
the white blur is actually a little BOY lost, sobbing 
uncontrollably.

CLOSEUP - DUNCAN

Awakening to the scene, coming back to reality. He is 
confused.

WIDER ANGLE ON DUNCAN AND BOY

The boy continues sobbing, moving about in little circles. 
Duncan, amazed at what he sees, slowly crawls out from the 
wall on his hands and knees, crawls toward the weeping child, 
staring at it with a strange look on his face.

Suddenly the boy stops crying and looks at Duncan quizzically, 
hesitantly. They are less than a foot apart, almost face to 
face. Together they form a kind of frozen tableau. Something 
close to sympathy crosses the killer's expression, and the 
boy, likewise, achieves a faint sense of recognition.

Then, just as suddenly, the boy starts wailing again and he 
runs off down the alleyway. Duncan watches him disappear. 
Then he slowly pulls himself to his feet.

EXT. STREET

Clifford is coming up the sidewalk. As Clifford crosses the 
entrance to an alleyway, the boy comes running out and almost 
collides with him. Clifford grabs the boy and looks down at 
him. Then he passes the wailing child off on a nearby 
PEDESTRIAN and runs up into the alley.

EXT. ANOTHER STREET

Duncan is hurrying along the sidewalk. Something makes him 
look up.

POV - DUNCAN

He is looking at a neon "Jesus Saves" sign above the doorway 
to an inner city mission.

BACK ON DUNCAN

As he stares at the sign.

		DUNCAN (O.S.)
	Hey, Crazy Curt!

Duncan turns to see Cheater elatedly hobbling up to him.

		CHEATER
	Hail fellow well met, and all that 
	jazz. It's our lucky day!
		(taking Duncan by the 
		arm)
	A friend of your's got money for 
	you. We got to get back to the park 
	and meet him.

Duncan pulls his arm free.

		CHEATER
	C'mon. He'll be comin' for you, Crazy 
	Curt. S'got some money.
		(reaching for Duncan's 
		arm)
	We'll get us a little joy juice.

Duncan pulls free again and heads toward the mission.

		CHEATER
	C'mon! Hey!! You really are crazy! 
	C'mon!

Duncan enters the mission and Cheater stands out on the 
sidewalk for a moment, bitterly frustrated.

		CHEATER
	"Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! 
	Rage! Blow, you cataracts and 
	hurricanoes, spout till you have 
	drench'd our steeples and drown'd 
	the cocks!"

Several PEDESTRIANS stop and gape at this sudden outburst.

EXT. ANOTHER STREET

Clifford comes out of a derelict hotel, looks up and down 
the street and hurries off, not giving up the chase.

INT. MISSION - MOMENTS LATER

A MAN is leading Duncan to the bathroom. Duncan enters slowly 
and goes to one of the wash basins where there is an old 
razor blade and a can of shaving cream. Duncan picks up the 
razor for a moment and looks at it. He is lost in thought. 
Then he sets it down and turns on the tap water.

He glances at himself in the mirror and is suddenly transfixed 
by his own image. He looks deeply into the mirror for several 
seconds. Then he starts to cry, and having begun, a flood of 
emotions comes pouring out of him. He drops to his knees.

The man comes running back into the bathroom. He holds Duncan 
and helps pull him back to his feet.

											CUT TO:

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Cheater is trudging along the sidewalk, hands in pockets, 
head lowered. He looks up and sees something that brings him 
back to life.

POV - CHEATER

Clifford is standing on the corner up ahead, looking around.

WIDE ANGLE ON STREET

Cheater calls out and starts to run toward Clifford.

Clifford turns, sees Cheater.

											CUT TO:

INT. MISSION - NIGHT

The "sleeping dorm". It is a large empty room. Thirty or so 
OUTCASTS are stretched out on the bare floor in the darkness. 
Their combined snoring/wheezing creates a steady, ghastly 
din.

The door at the far end of the hall opens. A figure steps in 
and quietly closes the door behind him. He stands for a moment 
taking in the scene, letting his eyes adjust to the darkness. 
Then he slowly creeps forward to the prone body of the nearest 
sleeper.

CLOSEUP - FIGURE

It is Clifford. He moves stealthily from one body to the 
next. In one hand he carries a small flashlight. He turns 
the bodies over just long enough to shine the light in their 
faces and identify who they are, or rather who they are not. 
Then he moves on. In his other hand he holds a small, gleaming 
Jimmy needle.

CLOSEUP - DUNCAN

He's sleeping, but his eyes suddenly open, sensing danger. 
He turns over and sees the dark figure of Clifford slowly 
advancing toward him.

WIDER ANGLE

Clifford keeps coming, closer and closer to where Duncan 
lies. He is but six or seven bodies away when Duncan jumps 
up suddenly and bolts for the door.

Clifford looks up, sees the fleeing figure and charges after 
it.

INT. CORRIDORS

Racing through a maze of narrow hallways, Duncan can't stop 
to think where he's going. Clifford is barreling after him 
some forty yards behind.

Duncan rounds a corner and ten yards up ahead, the hallway 
deadends in a set of double doors. Duncan has no choice but 
to hurl himself against the doors. They yield and he goes 
through them.

Four seconds later, Clifford comes to the same doors and 
pushes through to the other side.

INT. CHURCH

As Clifford comes through the doors which are a side entrance 
into the chancel of this large, gothic-style church. Behind 
him now, is the altar. Before him stretches the nave of the 
edifice with its rows of pews, its dimly glowing stained 
glass windows, and way in the back, its choir loft. At regular 
intervals, tiny shafts of light pierce the darkness from on 
high.

There is no sign of Duncan, but Clifford knows he must be in 
here, hiding somewhere. He slowly walks forward to the front 
of the chancel.

		CLIFFORD
	Duncan. Duncan. It's over now. Come 
	on out.

Pause. Duncan doesn't come out. Clifford holds very still. 
He hears nothing. He speaks again and his voice echoes through 
the large empty church.

		CLIFFORD
	My name's John Clifford. I'm a private 
	detective. I've been hired by 
	Alexander Mandrakis to take you back. 
	I'm not going to hurt you.

CLOSEUP - DUNCAN

Hiding beneath a pew. He hears the name "Mandrakis" and it 
registers like a thunderbolt. He silently mouths the name 
"Mandrakis".

Then he hears Clifford's footsteps approaching.

ANGLE ON CLIFFORD

Slowly moving up the center aisle, looking from side to side 
into the pews.

		CLIFFORD
		(gently; coaxing)
	I'm not going to hurt you... I'm not 
	going to hurt you... There'll be no 
	more pain... You're safe now...

Clifford moves closer and closer to Duncan's row until 
finally, Duncan can bear it no longer. He jumps up from 
beneath the pew and runs.

		DUNCAN
		(hysterical)
	No! Mandrakis! No!

Clifford chases him through the pews and up the aisles to 
the front of the church. He is clutching a needle in both 
hands, ready to strike.

Duncan flees through a narrow door off to the side of the 
church.

INT. BELL TOWER

Duncan faces a spiraling stone staircase. He has no choice 
but to climb them, higher and higher, the sound of Clifford's 
angry footsteps always coming up behind him.

Finally, Duncan can climb no higher. He is at the top of the 
bell tower. A lanceted opening in the stone wall ahead of 
him looks out over the narrow shaft of the tower. Above him 
are the huge iron bells. A rope hangs down from the bells, 
dangling all the way down the shaft, forty or fifty feet to 
the floor of the church.

Clifford is bounding up the last flight of steps to get him. 
Duncan has little choice. He is trapped. Just before Clifford 
reaches him, Duncan leaps out into the shaft and catches the 
bell rope.

The bell starts to clang as Duncan, hanging in mid air, swings 
back and forth within the narrow shaft. Clifford leans way 
out through the lancet window and takes a swipe at Duncan, 
but the madman is just beyond his reach and hurriedly climbing 
down the rope.

Clifford reaches out and tries to grab at the rope. At last, 
he gets it, and he shakes it violently to get Duncan to lose 
his grip and be dashed against the stone floor below.

But Duncan holds firm, climbing ever downward. The bell 
continues to clang, sending its alarm out into the night. 
Then Clifford braces himself and slowly, laboriously begins 
to haul up on the rope.

Clifford gains momentum until Duncan is being pulled up faster 
than he is climbing down. Still twenty feet off the ground, 
Duncan lets go of the rope and plummets to the hard stone 
floor.

Then PEOPLE come rushing into the church, awakened by the 
commotion of the bells. Duncan rolls into the shadows and 
drags himself out a side door, while Clifford plans his own 
escape from the bell tower.

											CUT TO:

EXT. ALLEYWAY NEAR CHURCH - NIGHT

Clifford runs up the alleyway, looks around and finally 
realizes he's lost his prey.

											CUT TO:

EXT. ANOTHER ALLEYWAY

Duncan is hidden deep in the shadows of a nook between two 
buildings, catching his breath. CAMERA MOVES IN on him, and 
we see him looking the craziest he's ever been. He shakes 
uncontrollably and begins to mumble, softly at first, then 
getting louder. He's falling back into the grips of Guy du 
Marraux.

										DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. CITY - MORNING

A. All is still and quiet as soft, warm sunlight pours into 
the dirty streets and alleyways. In the background, the bell 
tower of the church rises above the skyline.

B. We see a SHOT of the park -- all the bums are asleep.

C. Then a SHOT of the mission -- its front door open, the 
sidewalk empty.

D. Then the bar, where the same peaceful mood prevails.

E. Then the alleyway where we last saw Curt Duncan. Now he 
is gone.

F. Then the exterior of Tracy's apartment building. Clifford's 
car is parked out front.

		TRACY (O.S.)
	I used to see my two kids every 
	weekend. They lived in a nice house 
	with their father, outside the city.

											CUT TO:

INT. TRACY'S APARTMENT

Tracy and Clifford are sitting at a small table in the 
kitchen, looking haggard, drinking coffee.

		TRACY
	Now... it's been years. They're grown 
	up.

They look at each other. Clifford is a sympathetic listener.

		TRACY
	I look at where I am now. I know I 
	could've done better, but... it's 
	too late for that.

		CLIFFORD
		(quietly)
	I know.

Pause.

		TRACY
	Well, you've got to keep looking, I 
	suppose.

Taking his cue, Clifford slowly rises.

		CLIFFORD
	I don't think he'll come back here.

Tracy looks up at him questioningly, wishing she could feel 
as sure about it as he does.

		CLIFFORD
		(extending his hand)
	Thanks... for all your help.

Tracy takes his hand. They shake warmly.

		CLIFFORD
	I know it wasn't easy.
		(turning to go)
	Maybe, someday, I'll be able to...

		TRACY
	I wish you wouldn't leave me 
	altogether...

Clifford turns back to her.

		TRACY
		(with a laugh)
	I'm not a young woman anymore. I've 
	given up all my dreams of the future. 
	Now, I just want to make it to the 
	end. You know what I mean.

Clifford smiles at her gently. He knows exactly what she 
means.

		CLIFFORD
	I'll be around.

		TRACY
	Sure.

Clifford takes a few steps, turns back, looks at her.

		CLIFFORD
	You like ice cream?

		TRACY
	Yes.

		CLIFFORD
	What flavor?

		TRACY
	Chocolate chip.

Clifford nods his head slightly, as if registering this in 
his memory.

		CLIFFORD
		(quietly)
	Okay.

They smile at each other for a second then Clifford leaves 
and Tracy sits alone in her kitchen, listening to him go, 
hearing the door close behind him.

											CUT TO:

EXT. STREET - DAY

CLOSE UP on a section of a newspaper lying in the gutter. A 
pair of feet enters the frame and stands beside the newspaper. 
We hear a familiar cough. Then a trembling hand reaches down 
and picks up the newspaper.

Pause. Something in the newspaper has caught his eye. Then 
the feet shuffle out of frame.

										FADE OUT:

FADE IN:

EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON

A modest middle-income neighborhood where young married 
couples buy their first home and start their family.

CAMERA is facing down the quiet street. In the foreground, 
on the street, two small CHILDREN, a little boy and a little 
girl, are playing. They are adorable kids.

CAMERA PANS ninety degrees with the children as they run out 
of the street and up the sidewalk to their house.

A TITLE APPEARS across the bottom of the screen:

				5 pm Friday, April 28, 1978

TITLE FADES as the children push open the front door and 
enter the house.

											CUT TO:

INT. HOUSE - FOLLOWING CHILDREN

They noisily and excitedly make their way to the kitchen.

The children are four and two and a half years old, STEVIE 
and JUNE respectively.

											CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN

As the kids enter, their MOTHER is working at the stove, her 
back to CAMERA.

		JUNE &amp; STEVIE
		(together)
	Hi, Mommy!

The mother turns around. It is Jill Johnson!

		JILL
		(smiling)
	Well, look what the wind blew in!

CAMERA MOVES IN on her as she comes forward, bends down, 
kisses Stevie, and picks up June. Jill looks older, more 
mature, but still very pretty. She is Mrs. John Lockhart 
now, and has left her memories of the past behind her.

		STEVIE
	Mommy, what's for dinner? Could we 
	have hamburgers?

		JILL
		(teasing)
	Is that all you ever want?

A wall phone in the kitchen starts to ring. Stevie goes to 
answer it.

		STEVIE
	Hello?

		JOHN (O.S.)
		(surprised)
	Hey, how's my little tiger?

It is JOHN LOCKHART on the phone.

		STEVIE
	Daddy, Junie threw my baseball down 
	the street; and I can't find it!

		JOHN (O.S.)
	Well, we'll look for it real hard 
	later. Let me talk to mommy.

Jill, by this time, has come to the phone. She is still 
holding June.

		STEVIE
	Okay. Bye, daddy.

Stevie hands the phone to Jill.

		JILL
	Hi.

		JOHN
	Hi, babe -- whaddya say you put on a 
	sexy dress, and I take you out to 
	dinner tonight?

Jill is very happy about this.

		JILL
	Great... what's the occasion?

		JOHN
		(teasing)
	Just a little surprise.

		JILL
	What?

		JOHN
	I'm leaving here now; be home in 
	half an hour.

		JILL
	Okay, see ya.

		JOHN
	Bye, babe.

As Jill hangs up the phone, Stevie pipes up O.S.

		STEVIE (O.S.)
	Mommy, is Daddy gonna get me a new 
	baseball?

											CUT TO:

EXT. DR. MANDRAKIS' HOUSE - NIGHT

Clifford's car is parked in the driveway, and we see him 
getting out. He goes to the front door -- the porch light is 
on and perhaps one other lamp somewhere inside the otherwise 
dark house. He rings the bell, waits, rings again...

Finally the door is opened by the Houseboy.

		HOUSEBOY
	Dr. and Mrs. Mandrakis are out of 
	town.

		CLIFFORD
	For how long?

		HOUSEBOY
	Three more weeks.

Pause.

		CLIFFORD
	It's just as well. Will you be here?

		HOUSEBOY
	Yes.

Clifford takes a business card from his pocket and gives it 
to the Houseboy.

		CLIFFORD
	Here. Call if you need me.

The Houseboy reads the card as Clifford walks back to his 
car. Then the Houseboy closes the front door.

Clifford pauses beside his car for a moment, looking back at 
the rich, dark home.

											CUT TO:

INT. JILL'S HOUSE - CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The children are in bed. Jill is sitting next to Stevie. 
Only a nightlight is on.

		STEVIE
	...I pray the Lord my soul to keep. 
	If I die before I wake, I pray the 
	Lord my soul to take. God bless Mommy 
	and Daddy and...

		JUNE
	And me.

		STEVIE
	...and Granmom and Aunt Lucy and 
	Uncle George...

		JUNE
	And me!

		STEVIE
		(pausing)
	...and her. Now will you tell us a 
	story?

		JILL
	No, I will not tell you a story. You 
	go to sleep now. And be good. Carol 
	will be here while we're gone.

		STEVIE
	Goodnight.

Jill kisses him.

		JUNE
	Mommy, will you come here a minute? 
	I want to tell you something.

Jill stands up and goes over to June's bed.

		JILL
	What is it?

		JUNE
	Come closer.

Jill bends closer to her daughter. O.S. the doorbell rings.

		JUNE
	I love you.

		JILL
	I love you, too, Junebug.
		(kissing her)
	Goodnight. Sleep tight.

Jill stands up and leaves.

INT. FRONT HALL

As Jill comes down the stairs. CAROL, the sitter, is at the 
foot of the stairs with John. Carol has an armful of 
schoolbooks.

		JILL
	Hi, Carol.

		CAROL
	Hello, Mrs. Lockhart. I saw your 
	picture in the paper the other day. 
	Congratulations.

		JILL
	Ugggh... wasn't it a dreadful picture?

		JOHN
	I thought it was nice.

Jill crosses to a hall table, picks up a phone book, flips 
through it, then writes on a notepad beside the phone. Over 
this action...

		JOHN
	Are the kids asleep?

		JILL
	They will be soon.
		(to Carol)
	Give them about twenty minutes and 
	then take a peek -- but if Stevie 
	sees you, you'll have to tell him a 
	story.
		(beat)
	Here's the number of the restaurant. 
	Call us if you need us. For police, 
	ambulance, any emergency like that, 
	just dial 911. You know that, right?

		CAROL
	Nine-one-one? Oh, sure.

		JILL
	And just in case, I've written the 
	number of the children's Uncle George 
	and Aunt Lucy here, too.

		JOHN
	Honey, in ten seconds I eat the 
	staircase.

		JILL
	Okay. Okay.

She puts down the pad and crosses to a closet where she takes 
out a lightweight coat.

		JILL
		(handing the coat to 
		John)
	Here.

		JOHN
		(not taking the coat)
	I'm not wearing that thing!

Jill shoves the coat into his stomach. Smiling, he takes the 
coat and dutifully helps her on with it.

		CAROL
	Have a good time.

		JILL
	Thanks, Carol.

		JOHN
		(pulling her out the 
		door)
	Bye, Carol.

		CAROL
	Goodbye.

		JILL
	Goodbye.

											CUT TO:

EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

John and Jill walk to the station wagon in the driveway as 
Carol shuts the front door in the background. Just before 
Jill gets into the car, she takes a look back at the house -- 
there is a moment's hesitance, and then she gets in the car.

INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

Carol picks up the phone and carries it into the living room 
with her. As she does it, we see lying on the phone table, 
the newspaper clipping with Jill's picture, and headline: 
"Jill Lockhart Chairs Community UNICEF Drive."

She puts the phone down, then her books, then herself. She 
dials a number. Her BOYFRIEND answers.

		BOYFRIEND (O.S.)
	Hello?

		CAROL
	Hi. It's me.

		BOYFRIEND (O.S.)
	Oh, hi.

		CAROL
	Can you come over?

		BOYFRIEND (O.S.)
	I can't. I really have a lot of work 
	to do.

		CAROL
		(disappointed)
	Ohhh...

											CUT TO:

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

An Italian Restaurant. Quiet music, soft lights, red and 
white checkered tablecloths, candles, a smokey and seductive 
atmosphere.

DOLLY with a LATIN WAITER carrying a huge tray of food over- 
head. He passes right by the table where Jill and John are 
sitting. John watches him take the food to someone else.

		JOHN
		(reaching for a 
		breadstick)
	I've eaten enough breadsticks to 
	turn into a pretzel.

		JILL
	John, tell me about the surprise.

		JOHN
	Oh, yeah. Brace yourself.

		JILL
	I'm braced.

		JOHN
	Good. I got the sack today.

		JILL
	What sack?

		JOHN
	The can... I was fired!

		JILL
	Oh, sure.

		JOHN
	You don't believe me?

		JILL
	No, I don't believe you.

		JOHN
	Well, Wally did call me into his 
	office today. And he did tell me I 
	didn't have my old job anymore.

		JILL
		(getting excited)
	John, what did you get?

		JOHN
	Are you ready for this?

		JILL
		(guessing)
	District Sales Manager!

		JOHN
	Regional!

		JILL
	Regional?!

		JOHN
	Nah, District.

		JILL
		(beside herself)
	John, I don't believe it! District 
	Sales Manager!

The WAITER arrives with their food.

		JILL
	Well, it's about time!

The waiter looks up, offended.

		JILL
		(to waiter)
	Not you.
		(back to John)
	It's about time they recognized you 
	for what you are.

		WAITER
	Enjoy your dinner, folks.

They ignore him. He moves away. John digs right in.

		JOHN
		(mouth full)
	I'll be the youngest District Manager 
	in the company's history. God, am I 
	hungry!

		JILL
		(not eating yet)
	Does this mean a raise?

		JOHN
	It sure does.

John flags down a passing WAITER and signals that their wine 
glasses need filling.

		JILL
	How much?

		JOHN
	A lot.

		JILL
	How much?

John leans forward and whispers in her ear.

		JILL
	You're kidding! And a car?

		JOHN
	And a car.

		JILL
	John, I'm so proud of you.

John pauses, looks at her.

		JOHN
	What's the matter? You don't like 
	your food?

The MAITRE D' has come up to the table. John stops suddenly. 
They are both very chagrined.

		MAITRE D'
	Mr. and Mrs. Lockhart?

		JILL
	That's right.

		MAITRE D'
	There's a telephone call for you.

John starts to get up. Jill grabs his arm.

		JILL
	Eat your dinner. It's probably Carol. 
	I'll talk to her.

Jill stands up and follows the Maitre D' through the other 
tables to the telephone. She picks up the receiver. CAMERA 
MOVES in on her.

		JILL
	Hello?

Pause.

		DUNCAN (O.S.)
	Have you checked the children?

Jill screams and falls to the floor.

ANGLE ON JOHN

Around him, other DINERS fall instantly silent and wonder 
what is going on. WAITERS stop dead in their tracks.

John leaps up from his seat and dashes through the tables 
like a madman. Suddenly the restaurant comes alive with 
excitement and alarm.

ANGLE ON JILL

As John runs up and drops to his knees beside her. She is 
shaking and sobbing uncontrollably.

		JOHN
	Jill, what's happening? What's wrong?

		JILL
	It was him! Somebody call the police! 
	Help me!

Other PEOPLE have crowded around and are making urgent noises 
now about calling the police, an ambulance, etc. John tries 
to cut through the confusion and anxiety.

		JOHN
	Wait a minute! Just hold on! 
	Sweetheart, what was him? What are 
	you talking about?

		JILL
	That man... Curt Duncan... He's home 
	again! He's got our children!

		JOHN
	He was on the phone?

Jill nods.

John grabs the telephone and quickly dials a number. The 
crowd tries to quiet down, as much to hear for themselves as 
to let John talk. The phone rings and rings. Finally...

		CAROL
	Hello?

		JOHN
	Hello, Carol, it's Mr. Lockhart. 
	What's going on over there?

		CAROL
	Nothing's going on.

		JOHN
	Is everything all right?

		CAROL
	Yes, there's nothing --

		JOHN
	Are you sure?

Pause.

		CAROL
	Everything's fine. Why? What's --?

		JOHN
	Carol, listen to me very carefully. 
	If there's a man in the house, if 
	there's any reason why you can't 
	talk to me right now, just answer 
	yes to me over the phone. That's 
	all. If there's any danger of any 
	kind, just say yes.

Long pause. They wait for her answer. Jill is listening into 
the receiver now, too.

		CAROL
	I don't understand what's happening. 
	What man in the house?

Jill is confused. John breathes a guarded sigh of relief. 
Jill takes the phone.

		JILL
	Carol, it's Mrs. Lockhart. Answer me 
	truthfully. When was the last time 
	you looked in on the children?

		CAROL
	About forty-five minutes ago. 
	Everything's fine. They were fast 
	asleep.

Jill gives her husband a look. John takes the phone again.

		JOHN
	Carol, I'm sorry about all the 
	hysterics. We're leaving the 
	restaurant now. We'll explain 
	everything when we get home. Before 
	we hang up, could you do just one 
	more thing for me, please?

		CAROL
	What?

		JOHN
	Would you go upstairs and, and check 
	on the children for me?

Jill is violently shaking her head. John silences her with a 
gesture.

		CAROL
	Sure. Hold on.

Carol O.S. puts the phone down. Then there is silence on the 
other end. The crowd of people around Jill and John begin to 
shuffle and murmur. John tries to keep them quiet while 
listening into the phone.

Then TWO POLICEMEN come forward through the crowd. One of 
them kneels down to John and Jill who are still on the floor.

		POLICEMAN #1
	What seems to be the problem here, 
	sir?

		JOHN
		(whispering)
	Officer, I'm John Lockhart. Just a 
	second please, and I'll explain 
	everything.

		JILL
		(whispering to 
		Policeman)
	I'm Jill Johnson, the babysitter 
	seven years ago with the child killer.

This means nothing to Policeman #1.

		JOHN
	The babysitter. The guy got into the 
	house and killed the two children 
	upstairs.

Policeman #2 kneels down now.

		POLICEMAN #2
		(whispering)
	Oh, yeah, I remember something about 
	that. A Greek doctor...

		JOHN
	That's right. That's the one.

		POLICEMAN #2
		(to Policeman #1)
	It was in the seventh precinct...

As the two policemen and John mumble between themselves, 
Jill takes the telephone.

		JILL
		(listening)
	Hello?

She presses the receiver tighter to her ear.

		JILL
	Carol?

John quiets down the policeman. Jill can now hear what she 
couldn't a second ago.

		JILL
		(growing hysterical)
	Carol? Carol?!

ZOOM into the telephone until we can also hear what Jill is 
reacting to. It grows louder and louder... A dial tone.

											CUT TO:

EXT. LOCKHART HOUSE - NIGHT

John and Jill pull up in the station wagon followed by a 
squad car -- no sirens or lights. They all get out and rush 
for the front door.

John pulls out his key to open the door... and discovers 
that it's unlocked. Cautiously, they step inside.

INT. FRONT HALL

They look into the living room. Carol isn't there.

		JOHN
	Carol? Carol?

No answer. The policemen tentatively draw their guns. Jill 
bolts up the stairway.

		JOHN
	Jill!

Policeman #2 runs up after her.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALL

As Jill runs down to the children's bedroom followed by 
Policeman #2. She opens the door and rushes inside.

INT. CHILDREN'S BEDROOM

The children are in bed, asleep. Policeman #2 stands in the 
doorway as Jill goes up to June and bends over her.

		JUNE
		(opening her eyes)
	Mommy?

Jill kisses her gently on the forehead.

		JILL
	Sshhh...

June closes her eyes and immediately falls back to sleep. 
Jill walks over to Stevie's bed and looks down at him. He 
turns slightly in his sleep.

Satisfied that her children are safe, Jill pulls up the covers 
on Stevie and then walks slowly out of the bedroom.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALL

Jill quietly pulls the door shut, and Policeman #2 walks 
back up the hallway. Jill leans against the wall and buries 
her face in her hands. She is drained. She starts to cry.

		JOHN (O.S.)
	Nothing was wrong?

		CAROL (O.S.)
	When I got back to the phone, the 
	line was dead. I figured we got cut 
	off somehow. What's been going on?

											CUT TO:

INT. BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Jill is sitting on a corner of the bed, looking at the floor. 
John sits on the other corner, facing away from her, slowly 
unbuttoning his shirt. After a long silence...

		JILL
	What are you thinking about?

		JOHN
	If I ever get my hands on the guy 
	that made that call...

		JILL
	John, it wasn't a prank. I know that 
	voice.

		JOHN
	He disguised it though, didn't he? 
	Same as before?

		JILL
	I know that voice.

Pause.

		JILL
	How can we just sit here?

John turns and moves over beside her.

		JOHN
	Look, we promised never to talk about 
	this.

REACTION SHOT of Jill. She is shocked.

		JOHN
	What are we supposed to do? Leave 
	town? Take the kids and lock ourselves 
	up somewhere? Come on... Let's get a 
	good night's sleep, and in the morning 
	we can rethink this whole thing.

		JILL
	Nothing has to be rethought. And I'm 
	not about to fall asleep.

		JOHN
	Try to relax, honey. I'm here. We're 
	both here. The house is locked up. 
	The cops'll be just outside all night 
	long. We're safe now.

		JILL
	That's what they told me before.

John stands up and goes to his dresser.

		JOHN
	Okay. Look. If it'll make you feel 
	any better...

He takes a revolver from the dresser drawer and emphatically 
checks the action. Then he walks to his side of the bed and 
sets the pistol on his bedside table.

		JOHN
	I'll keep it right here beside me 
	all night. You know I'm a light 
	sleeper and a damn good shot. Are 
	you satisfied?

Pause. Jill tries to smile.

		JILL
	John, I'm sorry to be putting you 
	through all this.

		JOHN
	Hey, you're not putting me through 
	anything that you don't have to go 
	through yourself. I'm with you all 
	the way. Trust me. Okay?

Jill nods. John leans forward and kisses her.

		JOHN
	That's my girl.

He gets up and walks out of the room talking.

		JOHN (O.S.)
	Now try to relax. We'll get some 
	sleep. You'll be surprised how 
	differently things will look in the 
	morning.

		JILL
		(complaining)
	Honey...

		JOHN (O.S.)
	What?

		JILL
	Not so loud. You're going to wake 
	the children.

John comes back into the bedroom with a glass of water and a 
couple of pills in his hand.

		JOHN
		(smiling)
	Naw. Those kids'd sleep through an 
	earthquake. They're good kids.
		(handing her the pills 
		and water)
	Here, take a couple of these. They're 
	just what the doctor ordered.

CLOSEUP - JILL

As she takes the pills and swallows them, one at a time.

		JOHN (O.S.)
	You know, I read somewhere about 
	this psychological thing called 
	hysterical delusion or hysterical 
	recall or something. It had to do 
	with how an event from your past can 
	sneak up on you sometimes and fool 
	you when it's only just a memory. I 
	don't know. We'll talk about it in 
	the morning. Maybe there's someone 
	we can see about that...

											CUT TO:

INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

The lounge area in the back of the station. At one table, 
three OFFICERS are playing bridge. Garber with his back to 
CAMERA rounds out their game.

At a nearby table closer to CAMERA, Policeman #1 is working 
on a crossword puzzle. POLICEMAN #3, sitting next to him, is 
reading a paperback novel.

		POLICEMAN #1
	What's a word for "an outsider, of 
	sorts"?

		POLICEMAN #3
	Trespasser.

		POLICEMAN #1
	Uh-uh. Eight letters.

		POLICEMAN #3
	Stranger.

		POLICEMAN #1
	Uh-uh. Starts with an "I".

Policeman #3 thinks briefly, then goes back to his novel. 
Policeman #2 enters the room carrying a printout of some 
sort.

		POLICEMAN #2
	Hey, Bert. A report just came in on 
	that guy, Curt Duncan.

ANGLE ON GARBER

At the bridge table, perking up his ears, looking around.

		POLICEMAN #2 (O.S.)
	Broke outta the nuthouse two months 
	ago.

Garber is keeping only half an eye on the card game. He pulls 
a card from his hand and throws it down.

		POLICEMAN #1 (O.S.)
	Oh, yeah? You going to put that in 
	our report?

		OFFICER #1 (O.S.)
	Diamonds, Charlie. Diamonds was led.

Garber hastily picks up his card and throws down another.

		POLICEMAN #2 (O.S.)
	Course I'm going to put it in the 
	report. Maybe this gal tonight really 
	did get a call from him. Who knows?

		OFFICER #1 (O.S.)
	Your lead, Charlie.

Garber throws down another card.

		OFFICER #1 (O.S.)
	What the hell are you doing? That's 
	a trump.

		OFFICER #2 (O.S.)
	A card laid is a card played.

		POLICEMAN #1 (O.S.)
	Yeah, you're right. We'd better leave 
	that on Ruznik's desk in the morning.

		OFFICER #2 (O.S.)
	Toss 'em in. I got the rest.

		OFFICER #1 (O.S.)
	Jesus Kay-Reist!

Garber throws down his cards. He stands up and approaches 
Policeman #2.

		GARBER
	Hey, Tucker, lemme see that a minute.

Policeman #2 hands the sheet of paper to Garber. Garber 
quickly scans the information.

		GARBER
	You guys have a stake on the house?

		POLICEMAN #2
	Bernstein and Waller are checkin' it 
	every twenty minutes or so.

		GARBER
		(handing back the 
		sheet)
	Thanks.

Garber exits to his office. Policeman #2 walks over to where 
Policeman #1 is still sitting, working the crossword.

		POLICEMAN #1
	Hey, what's an eight letter word for 
	"an outsider, of sorts"? Starts with 
	an "I".

		POLICEMAN #2
	Intruder!

		POLICEMAN #1
	Right! Intruder!

											CUT TO:

INT. GARBER'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Garber sits thinking for a moment. He is trying to come to a 
decision. He reaches for the phone and dials. It rings and 
then is picked up.

		CLIFFORD (O.S.)
	Hello?

		GARBER
	Cliff?... I think I got something 
	for you...

											CUT TO:

INT. LOCKHART HOUSE - NIGHT

A shot of the downstairs hall. All is dark and still, very 
still.

INT. BEDROOM

Jill is tossing in her sleep. John is fast asleep next to 
her, on his side facing away from her. Then, Jill wakes up. 
She is heavily sedated, groggy. She hardly knows where she 
is at first.

She pulls herself up to a sitting position on the side of 
the bed. She tries to gather her wits. Then she gets up and 
walks slowly out of the room.

FOLLOWING JILL

Through the upstairs hallway, down the staircase and toward 
the kitchen. The darkness around her is ominous, threatening.

She stops at the dining room window and looks out. On the 
street a patrol car slowly passes and disappears down the 
block.

INT. KITCHEN

Jill enters, turns on the light, opens a cupboard and takes 
out a glass. She goes to the refrigerator and opens it. 
Suddenly, the lights go out.

Jill closes the refrigerator door and goes and turns on 
another light. Apparently, only a lightbulb has blown. Jill 
unscrews the burned-out bulb from its socket and throws it 
in the trash.

She leaves the kitchen.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALL

Jill walks to a hall closet and opens it. A light comes on 
inside as she does so. A puzzled, half-startled expression 
comes onto her face.

JILL'S POV

Inside the closet, half the hangers with coats, etc., are on 
the floor.

Sound over: A telephone being dialed.

											CUT TO:

INT. CLIFFORD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Clifford has just finished dialing the phone. He waits, 
nothing happens. Then a strange, siren-like noise comes out 
of the telephone. Clifford listens, then hangs up.

He picks up the .38 he has lying on the desk and idly starts 
flipping the cartridge chamber with one of his jimmy needles. 
After a moment, he lays the gun down and picks up the phone 
again, this time calling the OPERATOR.

		OPERATOR (O.S.)
	Operator.

		CLIFFORD
	Can you dial a local number for me?

		OPERATOR (O.S.)
	What is the number, please?

		CLIFFORD
	555-2183.

The operator dials. There is a pause. Then the same strange 
noise cuts in.

		CLIFFORD
	Operator, what does that mean?

		OPERATOR (O.S.)
	I'm sorry, sir, that line seems to 
	be disconnected.

		CLIFFORD
	Why don't I get a recording?

		OPERATOR (O.S.)
	I don't know, sir. Maybe the number 
	was just recently disconnected. Maybe 
	there's a temporary malfunction in 
	the wiring. Why don't you try it 
	again in the morning?

		CLIFFORD
	Yeah, okay. Thanks.

											CUT TO:

INT. LOCKHART HOME - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

Jill is walking down the hall to the children's bedroom. She 
opens the door.

INT. CHILDREN'S BEDROOM

As Jill quietly enters. The children are asleep. Jill goes 
to June and tucks her in. Then she walks over to Stevie's 
bed. He is sleeping, but with a Sugar Daddy in his hand. 
Jill looks down at him, again puzzled. She leans over, takes 
the Sugar Daddy and gently wakes him.

		JILL
	Stevie... Stevie...

		STEVIE
		(stirring, but not 
		fully awake)
	Yes?

		JILL
	Stevie, listen to me. Where did you 
	get this candy?

		STEVIE
	What?

		JILL
	Where did you get this?

		STEVIE
		(very groggy)
	The man gave it to me...

		JILL
	What man?

		STEVIE
		(drifting off)
	I don't know... He was... Wings on a 
	horse...

He closes his eyes and is asleep.

Jill stands up, turns and starts to walk out of the room. 
Halfway across the floor, Jill stops. She stands rigid as a 
thought penetrates her own drowsiness. She turns very slowly 
and moves to the closet in the children's bedroom.

She stands before it a moment. Then she reaches her hand 
forward for the knob on the closet door. She very slowly 
pulls the door open. She looks inside. There is nothing.

Jill quietly closes the closet door and leaves the room.

INT. BEDROOM

Jill enters. John is still asleep facing the wall. Jill gets 
into bed, sitting up. She is wide awake now. She sits for a 
moment in the darkness, thinking.

Then she reaches for the princess phone on the bedside table. 
She doesn't get a dial tone. She quietly pushes the phone's 
disconnect button up and down several times. Still no dial 
tone.

Jill hangs up and thinks for another moment, apprehension 
creeping over her face.

Then, in the darkness of the bedroom, she begins to hear the 
muttering of a man's voice, low and deep. It is Duncan in 
the throes of Guy du Marraux.

Jill freezes. As the voice gets steadily louder and more 
menacing, her attention focuses on the door to the bedroom 
closet which is a couple of inches ajar.

		JILL
		(urgently whispering)
	John?... John?...

She reaches for the bedside lamp and turns it on, never taking 
her eyes away from the closet door. As soon as the light 
comes on, the voice stops.

Her eyes still riveted to the door, Jill grabs her husband's 
shoulder and shakes him, her voice cracking with fear.

		JILL
	John!... John!...

The body beside her stirs, rolls over, looks at her hideously. 
It is Duncan!!

Jill shrieks, and makes a move to leap out of the bed.

Duncan, the hideous and terrifying sound of his madness 
grumbling out of his throat, manages to grab the back of her 
nightgown.

As Jill struggles to get off the bed, the gown rips slightly 
while she fights to get away.

Duncan rolls to her side of the bed and manages to grab Jill's 
ankle while letting go of the gown. It causes Jill to lose 
her balance and tumble onto the floor just short of the 
doorway leading out of the room.

Duncan is on her in a flash, clutching at her and moving his 
hands for her throat. Jill screams again. It is the desperate 
sound of a woman facing certain death.

Suddenly, two quick shots ring out, overwhelming all other 
sound. Duncan falls back with a groan and a thud.

Out of the darkness of the hallway steps Clifford, pistol in 
hand. He crosses to Duncan. He is dead. Then Clifford walks 
around the room to the far side of the bed and looks down.

On the narrow strip of floor between the bed and the wall 
lies John. Clifford nudges the body with his foot. John stirs, 
as if he has been knocked unconscious, but it will be some 
time yet before he comes to.

Clifford starts to walk out of the room, stepping over 
Duncan's body, edging past Jill who is propped up in the 
doorway, sobbing hysterically.

		CLIFFORD
	Your husband's okay.

Then he is gone.

As Jill sits there unable to rein in her emotions, June and 
Stevie toddle up to her groggily from the hallway.

		JUNE
	Mommy?

Jill clutches her children to her heaving breast and buries 
her face between them.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALL

Looking through the open front doorway into the quiet night 
beyond.
