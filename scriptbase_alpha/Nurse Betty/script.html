						FADE IN:


1     INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY				  1

A tense surgery in progress.  Meters flicker, instruments
flash in the bright overhead light.  In the midst of it all
stands DR. DAVID RAVELL, 35.  The master of his domain.
Ravell leans forward so a NURSE can mop the sweat from his
brow as he completes a last, delicate procedure.  His co
workers sigh collectively with relief.

		DAVID
		(to Asst. Surgeon)
	Close her up, will you?



2     INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY			   2

Dr. Ravell comes out of surgery, clearly exhausted.  Without
his surgical mask he is ruggedly handsome.  TWO NURSES
follow, attending him like a fighter fresh from the ring:
CHLOE, 25, Raven-haired and striking, and JASMINE, 24, an
exotic mix of African-American and Asian.

BLAKE DANIELS, 58, the silver-haired Chief Surgeon, rushes up
the corridor.  On his heels is DR. LONNIE WALSH, 33. Lonnie
is also conspicuously handsome, but he'll always be second to
David.  In everything.
The look on Blake's face stops David in his tracks.

		BLAKE
	There's been a train crash near Santa
	Barbara. They're flying an aortal trauma
	here now.  How can I ask you this,
	David...

David rubs his eyes.  Thinks about it.

		DAVID
	I can do it, Blake.

His bravery isn't lost on the two nurses, although Chloe
exchanges a quick, covert glance with Lonnie.

		CHLOE
	Is he crazy, Jasmine?   He's been on his
	feet for fourteen hours.

		JASMINE
	Chloe, it's been this way since Leslie
	died.  Losing himself in his work, poor
	thing...

						    2.


		YOUNGER MAN'S
		VOICE
		(O.S.)
	... I'll give you something to lose
	yourself in...

		OLDER MAN'S VOICE
		(O.S.)
	Excuse me, miss?

PULL BACK TO REVEAL: WE ARE LOOKING AT A TELEVISION SCREEN
BEHIND THE COUNTER OF A SMALL-TOWN DINER.

INSERT:		FAIR OAKS, KANSAS



3     INT. TIP TOP DINER - DAY				   3

Quaint, Midwestern eatery.  Knick-knacks and photos abound.
The booths and counter are packed with LOCALS.  A family
dining section off in one corner.

TWO GUYS sitting at the counter in team jackets.  The older
of the two holds up his empty coffee cup.  But his WAITRESS,
standing a couple seats down from him, doesn't move. She's
completely absorbed in watching the soap opera that plays on
two battered, fuzzy TV sets.
BETTY SIZEMORE, 30, has a wholesome attractiveness that
competes with a bit too much makeup and a cheesy white
waitress uniform. TWO OTHER WAITRESSES attend to customers
behind her.
The younger of the two guys is involved in the soap opera.
But the older one, still wants coffee.  He gestures toward
Betty.

		OLDER MAN
	Miss?

Betty leans forward, grabs the coffee pot and moves in front
of him.  Without taking her eyes from the TV, she pours the
java, which somehow lands in his cup without spilling a drop.

		OLDER MAN
		(cont'd)
	Very impressive.  That is very...
		(turning to others)
	Did anybody see that?

The LOCAL GUYS around him don't even bother to look up. Of
course, they've seen it before.  Betty smiles.

						    3.


		OLDER MAN
		(cont'd)
	Thank you.  Could I bother you for a
	little more...?

Before he can even finish, Betty is topping him off with
milk.

		BETTY
	Skim, right?
		(tears open an Equal)
	And half a pack, if I remember correct...

The older gentleman's mouth works a bit but nothing comes
out.  He is flabbergasted by her attention to detail.  She
looks at the younger man, who is still following the show and
gobbling down a huge bacon burger.

		BETTY (cont'd)
	You know, you're never too young to start
	on a lean meat substitute...
		(BEAT)
	You wanna try some turkey bacon on that?

		YOUNGER MAN
	You want a tip when I'm through?

		BETTY
	It's your body...

Betty turns back to change pots.  The older man watches her
intently as the younger of the two mumbles to himself.

		YOUNGER MAN
		(to himself)
	That's right, so why don't you get up off
	it...

		OLDER MAN
	Wesley...
		(to Betty)
	I've told him the same thing.  Thanks for
	the suggestion.

		BETTY
	No problem.

Betty flashes the men a winning smile and moves off, one eye
always on the TV as she approaches two local types.

SHERIFF ELDEN BALLARD, 32, a short, tightly wound little man,
sitting at his own booth.  Ballard is spit and polish all the
way:  creases in his shirt, a glossy shine on his shoes.
Badge proudly displayed.  He sits with

						    4.


ROY OSTREY, 31, a gangly, bookish local reporter.  Betty
drops five ketchup packets and four mayonnaise packets on the
table for him.  Another smile.

		ROY
	Hi, Betty.  You're looking good...

		BETTY
	Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar,
	but sweet.  I liked your editorial this
	morning...

		ROY
	Oh, appreciate it.  I was trying to, ahh,
	give a sense of history to...

		BALLARD
		(interrupting)
	Yeah, it was great.  Really put the whole
	idea of "church bake sales" in
	perspective...

		ROY
	You know, Elden, some people actually
	read more than just the Classifieds...

		BALLARD
	Why don't you go back to doing something
	you're good at... like that Lonelyhearts
	column?
		(chuckles to himself)
	I'll take a refill there, Betty...

His cup is full before he can even finish the sentence.

		BETTY
	Hey, Sheriff.  How's everything?

		BALLARD
	Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the
	world safe.

		BETTY
	... I meant your food.

		BALLARD
	Oh, right... 's fine.  Thanks.

		ROY
	I thought you said the eggs weren't...

		BALLARD
	It's fine.  Mind your own meal...

						    5.


		ROY
	You should get the order you want.

		BALLARD
	And you should keep your nose out of
	another man's omelette...
		(to Betty)
	It's no big deal, Betty.

		BETTY
	There's yolks in there, huh?  It's no
	prob'... gotta keep you on track.

Betty grabs Ballard's plate without another word, gives him a
reassuring rub on the shoulders and moves off.  He smiles
appreciatively after her, then turns on Roy.

		BALLARD
	Why you always gotta embarrass me?  I
	been eating lunch with you since grade
	school and you always gotta embarrass me!

		ROY
	They're just eggs, Elden, how
	embarrassing can eggs be?

		BALLARD
	... plenty

		ROY
	Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?

		BALLARD
	Mind your own business.  You just said
	that shit so you could look at her a
	little longer, anyway...

Still carrying Ballard's plate, she returns to the counter.

		BETTY
	Come on, guys, I told you it's egg whites
	only for the Sheriff...
		(quietly)
	... I put him in that 'zone' thing.

		COOK #1
	Well, it better be a pretty good size
	zone if he's in it...

Betty and the cooks share a quick laugh.  They move to change
his order while Betty glances up at the TV.

						    6.




4     INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - RETURN TO TV SCREEN		 4

Lonnie catches up to Blake in the corridor.

		LONNIE
	Blake, I can handle that transplant!

		BLAKE
	We need someone with the right kind of
	experience, Lonnie.

		LONNIE
	Even if he's falling asleep on his feet?

		BLAKE
	Lonnie, it's a complex procedure.  Why
	don't you observe?

		LONNIE
	I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh
	out of medical school, Blake.

		BLAKE
	No, you're not.  You're a good doctor,
	Lonnie, but you're not David Ravell.
	I've made my decision.  Now, if you'll
	excuse me ...

Blake exits.  The camera moves in to hold on a CLOSEUP of
Lonnie's face as he simmers in anger.  Music soars.



5     INT. TIP TOP DINER - DAY				   5

Plates of food are piling up on the shelf in front of the
COOKS.  One of them turns the TV off by remote.

		BETTY
	Hey!  We were watching that!

		COOK #1
	The other girls've got orders up... we're
	not one 'a them goddamn Nelson families,
	y'know.

Betty snatches up several plates to help out.  Ballard's food
appears with A CLATTER of porcelain.

		BETTY
	It's "Nielson"...

		COOK #1
	Yeah, well, we ain't one 'a them,
	neither.

						    7.

		(BEAT)
	Go on now...

		DARLENE
	When you gonna get those things fixed,
	anyhow?

		COOK #1
	When you all quit watching 'em for a
	living...

Frustrated, Betty delivers several plates and drops them at
tables where the people know her by name.  She moves off
toward FOUR LOCAL GUYS in a booth jangling their empty cups.
Betty weaves her way over to them and pours refills.  When a
hand strays around to touch her ass, she pushes it away with
her foot and keeps right on pouring. Absently, Betty takes a
look around the restaurant.  The other waitresses are gone
and no one is behind the grill.  Alarmed, she pushes through
the double doors into the kitchen.



6     INT. TIP TOP DINER - KITCHEN - SAME TIME		     6

THREE WAITRESSES, along with the DISHWASHER and TWO COOKS are
standing in a row waiting for her.

		BETTY
	... alright, I get it, no more TV.
	Sorry.

No one moves, then DARLENE leads them in a huge SURPRISE!
They produce a life-size cardboard cut-out of Dr. David
Ravell, who looks dashing in his green hospital scrubs.
Betty backs up in disbelief.

		BETTY (cont'd)
	Oh my gosh, this is so embarrassing!
	Where did you ever find this?

		DARLENE
	On the goddamn internet, where else?

		BETTY
	You're joking...

		WAITRESS #1
	... nope, got him at "T.V. Hunks with
	Sweet Little Asses.Com."

		WAITRESS #2
	Seventy-five dollars...

		COOK #1
	... Seventy-eight fifty.
		(everyone looks at him)

						    8.

	Well, I paid for the damn thing, I oughta
	know.

		WAITRESS #2
	C'mon, Betty!  Pose with him!

Betty laughs and puts her arm around the cardboard man.  A
flash photo is taken.  A cupcake with a single candle is
placed in her hands.

		DARLENE
	One candle... uh-oh, you're getting up
	there!  Doesn't David like 'em young?

		BETTY
	I'm over the hill, what can I say?

Darlene gives Betty an envelope with cash showing.

		WAITRESS #1
	A little something for those nursing
	classes you've been wanting to take...

		DARLENE
	... but keep putting off thanks to a
	certain husband we won't mention...

		BETTY
	Oh, guys, you didn't have to do that!

		DARLENE
	So how you gonna celebrate?  Del takin'
	you into Wichita for a big fancy dinner?

The others laugh; they know better.  So does Betty.

		BETTY
	Yeah, Dairy Queen, maybe...  Oh, I should
	probably call him.  Thanks, you guys...

		COOK #1
	Alright, alright, come on... I'm not
	running no bed &amp; breakfast, we got
	customers.  Let's go...

Smiling, Betty grabs a wall phone as the others mingle about.



7     INT. SIZEMORE MOTORS - DEL'S OFFICE - DAY		    7

The trailer/office of a small-time car dealership. As the
PHONE RINGS, the CAMERA PANS across pictures of DEL SIZEMORE,
35, dressed as Napoleon, Caesar and Abe Lincoln, arms raised
in a high-energy sales pitch.

						    9.


The PHONE RINGS again.  We see a framed certificate of
achievement from General Motors, dated 1986.

After the THIRD RING an ANSWERING MACHINE clicks on. It's
loud.

		ANSWERING MACHINE
		(Del's voice)
	Hello there!  You've reached Sizemore
	Motors, home of the best selection of
	used General Motors cars in the Big
	Springs - Fair Oaks area.  We can't come
	to the phone right now 'cause we're out
	making a sale, so leave us a message;
	better yet, come on down and steal one 'a
	these beauties right out from under us!
	Coffee's always on!

		BETTY  (V.O.)
	Hi Del, it's me.  I guess you're busy.



8     INT. SIZEMORE MOTORS - TRAILER/OFFICE - DAY		  8

Del's very busy.  He's on the rented sofa in the trailer's
lounge, screwing his secretary, JOYCE.  But as he rocks the
couch, he's listening to Betty's message.

		BETTY  (V.O.)
	I know you want the Oldsmobile back
	tonight, so... I was wondering if I could
	take one of the new Buicks.

Del pulls out and lurches across the room.  He reaches for
the desk phone but misses, spilling down onto the carpet.  He
gathers himself and his pants up in disgust, pawing around
the desktop until he finds the phone.

		BETTY  (V.O.)
		(CONT'D)
	So, call me when you--

		DEL
	Whoa, whoa, whoa!  Hang on a second
	there, baby.  Why do you need one of the
	new Buicks?

		BETTY  (V.O.)
	Oh, you're there.  You sound out of
	breath.

		DEL
	I ran back in to get the phone.

						   10.


The answering machine is on, so their VOICES are BOOMING. The
phone cord is stretched across the trailer as he tries to get
back to Joyce.  He motions for her to join him but she
remains where she is, fuming.

		BETTY  (V.O.)
	I don't need one, but it's kind of a
	special night, and--

		DEL
	What's so special about it?

LONG PAUSE. Joyce looks at Del, incredulous. Then pissed off.
He signals to hold on.

		BETTY  (V.O.)
	Sue Ann's taking me out and I thought it
	might be fun to go in a nice car...

Joyce wriggles to a sitting position and begins to pull up
her panties.  Del shoots her a look that says 'I'm not
finished yet!'  They pantomime frantically back and forth
until Joyce throws him the finger and SLAMS out the door.

		BETTY (V.O)
		(CONT'D)
	What was that?

		DEL
	Nothing... it's, ahh, busy here.  Look,
	you don't need a LeSabre to go out with
	Sue Ann.  Take the blue Corsica.  I'll
	see you when I get home.

He throws the phone onto the cradle, then bangs on a window
to get Joyce's attention as she fires up a smoke.

		DEL (CONT'D)
		(through the pane)
	Shit!  Joyce, open the damn gate, will
	you?!

As Del zips up his pants Joyce trudges across the lot to
bring in the "Closed For Lunch" sign and open the gate.  Del
silently studies the much nicer car lot next door for a
moment.  He takes in the banners, the signs, etc.

		DEL (cont'd)
	... that's what we need, some goddamn
	flags.

						   11.




9     INT. OFFICE/TRAILER - LATER				9

Betty enters the office.  Joyce is on the phone.  She looks
up, irritated, and says something under her breath to the
caller.

		JOYCE
	Uhh, no, we haven't picked a date yet...
	well, once he dumps her we will.
		(to Betty)
	He's out pricing banners... I don't
	expect him back.

		BETTY
	"Banners?"

		JOYCE
	You know, flags and shit... he said "for
	a livelier look" or something.

Betty nods and swaps her car keys for a set Joyce gives her.

		JOYCE (cont'd)
	'S too bad about the LeSabres... they're
	a really sweet ride.

As Joyce prattles on, Betty notices the Buick LeSabre keys on
a rack behind her.  She sidles around Joyce, deftly removes a
set from the hook and drops them in her purse.  She smiles
and starts to wave goodbye as Joyce puts her call on hold.

		JOYCE (cont'd)
	Need something else?

		BETTY
	No, I was just... How you doing?

		JOYCE
	Great.  Good.  Content...

		BETTY
	Oh.  How come?

		JOYCE
	I dunno.  Job satisfaction, I guess...
		(BEAT)
	How's things at the Tip Top?

		BETTY
	They're fine... you miss it?

		JOYCE
	You must be joking.

						   12.


		BETTY
	Hmm.
		(BEAT)
	So, Del get that car he sold you up and
	running yet?

		JOYCE
	Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running,
	alright...

		BETTY
	'Kay, good.  Bye, then...

		JOYCE
	Uh-huh.
		(back to phone)
	Anyway, I'm thinking Easter, 'cause I
	just fucking love pastels.

She whispers, then laughs loudly as Betty leaves.



10     EXT. SIZEMORE MOTORS - DAY				10

The cardboard doctor is standing next to Betty's Olds.  She
thinks about leaving him, but picks him up and tosses him
into a blue Corsica.  He lands with his face against the
passenger window.

She stands for a moment by the Corsica, dangling the LeSabre
keys before her eyes.  Suddenly, she jumps inside the
Chevrolet and slams the door.



11     EXT. SIZEMORE MOTORS/TRAILER PARK - DAY		     11

The blue Corsica leaves the parking lot and pulls onto the
street.  The car makes an abrupt turn into a trailer park
directly behind the car lot and glides to a halt behind a row
of battered airstreams.

Betty gets outs of the Chevy and looks back:  the handsome
face of Doctor David Ravell is staring at her from the car.

		BETTY
	Oh, Christ, what am I gonna do with you?

She goes back to pick him up, then starts off.



12     EXT. TRAILER PARK - SAME TIME			 12

A row of cheap trailers on both sides of a crumbling
driveway.  Betty appears with her cardboard man tucked under
one arm and then disappears behind a pickup truck.

						   13.




13     EXT. SIZEMORE MOTORS - SAME TIME		      13

She tosses the cardboard "David" over a concrete slab wall,
climbs over herself and walks straight to the LeSabres.  Her
key opens the last one - maroon. She puts the doctor on the
passenger seat, gets in the car and inhales the new car
smell.

Joyce can be seen inside the trailer, still talking on the
phone.  She misses the whole scene as she works on her nails.

		BETTY
	We deserve this.



14     INT. LESABRE - DRIVING - DAY			  14

Betty has the car at 75 m.p.h., on the rural Kansas roads,
wheat fields for miles on both sides of her.  The RADIO is
blasting Bonnie Raitt and she's singing along.

She sees her speed and punches the accelerator ... 80 m.p.h.
... 85 ... 90 m.p.h.  She turns the radio up louder.

When she approaches a sign saying "You are leaving Kansas"
Betty suddenly becomes self-conscious.  She eases up on the
gas ... slows down ... does a U-turn and heads back toward
Fair Oaks.  She glances wistfully in her rear view mirror at
the billboard that quickly fades into the distance.



15     EXT. BETTY'S NEIGHBORHOOD - LATER		     15

Betty enters a modest residential neighborhood and pulls into
a driveway.  She parks in a detached garage and looks over at
the cardboard David.  There's no way he's going in the house.
She puts him in the trunk and closes the garage door.



16     EXT. SUE ANN'S HOUSE - SAME TIME		      16

She walks several houses down.  On her way to the door we
hear a DOG BARKING, CHILDREN and GENERAL COMMOTION from
inside.  SUE ANN ROGERS answers Betty's knock.  Her hair is
matted with sweat as she struggles with CHILDREN, ages 4, 3
and 6 months.  Suddenly, Sue Ann is hit by an errant rubber
ball.

		SUE ANN
	Hey, darling... oww!  Sorry, got my own
	little Gulf War going on here.

Betty takes the baby as Sue Ann pulls a videotape from a
shelf.  It's all one move; they do this every day.

						   14.


		BETTY
	Did you watch it yet?

		SUE ANN
	Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was
	any better looking it'd be a crime 'a
	some sort...

		BETTY
	Yep.  Hey, I got a surprise for tonight.
	We're going to the Starlite in style!

		SUE ANN
	Oh, Betty--

		BETTY
	I'll give you a hint.  If you scrunch up
	your eyes a bit it looks just like a
	Jaguar...

		SUE ANN
	Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call
	you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge
	meeting. There's no way I can get a
	sitter this fast.

		BETTY
		(disappointed)
	No... what about your sister?

		SUE ANN
	I can't ask her again-- Nathan, stop it!
	Jesse, don't take that, hit back!-- I
	feel terrible, hon.

After a beat ...

		BETTY
	It's all right.

		SUE ANN
	You sure?  Maybe next week we could...

		BETTY
	Uh-huh.  No, we'll do it later.  'S only
	a birthday, right?  I'll have another one
	next year...

Betty forces a smile, kisses the baby and hands it back to
Sue Ann, who hands her the videotape.

		SUE ANN
	Aahhh...
		(BEAT)
	So what color is it?

						   15.


		BETTY
	What?

		SUE ANN
	The LeSabre!

		BETTY
	Maroon.
		(BEAT)
	I stole it.

		SUE ANN
	What?

		BETTY
	He wasn't going to let us use it, so I
	just took it.

		SUE ANN
	Oh, I wish we could just get in it and
	drive, and drive, and drive!

		BETTY
	Yeah, me too.

		SUE ANN
	Sorry, hon.  Happy Birthday...

		BETTY
	I gotta go make dinner.

Betty throws her a look as Sue Ann closes the door.  Betty
turns around, frustrated.  She starts yanking her apron off
as she crosses the street.



17     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DAY				  17

A low-end ranch.  A worn-out sofa and loveseat form an 'L'
that dominates the living room.  Romance novels line a small
bookcase.  SIX CANARIES in cages chatter away in the kitchen.

Del sits at the dining room table, agitated.  He is presently
attacking a pork chop, baked beans and a loaf of Wonderbread.
All we hear is A FORK CLICKING and BIRDS CHIRPING.  Betty
stands at the breakfast counter, barefoot, still in her
uniform and quietly eating a salad.

		BETTY
	Sure you don't want any salad?

		DEL
	No, I do not want any goddamn... what was
	all that shit on the phone about the new
	Buicks?

						   16.


		BETTY
	I told you.  Sue Ann was gonna take me
	out tonight, but...

		DEL
	She's not comfortable in a Corsica?  'S
	got air and leather...

		BETTY
	I took the blue Corsica, Del.  Relax.

		DEL
	All right, then.  Actually, I'm glad
	you're going out.  I got something going
	on tonight.  Some serious clients, with
	real potential.

Del BELCHES, smiles, then CLUCKS at the birds nearby.

		BETTY
	... like the water purifiers?

		DEL
	What?

		BETTY
	Or the vitamins?  Or the...?

Del almost comes out of his chair, pointing his finger at
her.

		DEL
	Hey, the FDA screwed me on that when they
	changed the law, and you know it!
		(BEAT)
	Anyway, 'least I try shit, still got some
	dreams left... you're a goddamn waitress,
	what do you got?

		BETTY
	I got you, Del...

		DEL
	... well, then you ain't got much.

		BETTY
	Oh, I know.
		(BEAT)
	So, who're these clients?

		DEL
	Couple 'a guys in from outta town.  They
	want to see the new LeSabres.

Betty hides her reaction.

						   17.


		DEL (cont'd)
	And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around
	to fuck it up...

		BETTY
	Just knock it off, 'kay?  Anyhow, they're
	97's, they're not even new.

		DEL
	They're new to us...

Truce for a moment.  Del plucks a copy of Soap Opera Guide
from Betty's purse while absently taking a bite from Betty's
cupcake.  He narrowly misses the candle.

		DEL (cont'd)
	Jesus... you know these actors are mainly
	models, which are mainly fags.  They've
	done studies.  The rest're assholes.  But
	you know what bugs me most about these
	soaps?

She silently mimics him as he says...

		DEL (cont'd)
	It's people with no lives watching other
	people's fake lives.

		BETTY
	Yeah, I guess there's nothing like
	watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?

		DEL
	That is a skill!

Del lurches to his feet and crosses to the bird cages as the
canaries CHIRP and SING EXCITEDLY at his approach.

		DEL (cont'd)
	Daddy's here, babies... daddy's here.
		(to Betty)
	Be back later... clean up.

He exits.  She collects his dirty dishes, puts them in the
sink and starts to wash them.  Then she stops.

		BETTY
	What the hell am I doing?

She drops the dishes with a clatter, pours herself a glass of
wine, lights the candle on her deflowered cupcake and opens
the one card on the table.

CLOSE ON

						   18.


a traditional greeting from her grandparents.  Red hearts and
lace.  A color photo of them enclosed.

Betty smiles at this.  After moment, she quietly sings a
quick refrain of "Happy Birthday" to herself.



18     INT. LONNIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (ON TV SCREEN)	  18

Standing wrapped only in a towel, Lonnie speaks into the
phone.

		LONNIE
	Tell me something good, Sugar.



19     INT. CHLOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (ON TV SCREEN)	   19

The beautiful nurse Chloe is curled up seductively on her
sofa with her phone in one hand and a cigarette in the other.

		CHLOE
	We're all set.  I told him my car's in
	the shop.  He said he'd be happy to give
	me a ride home.

		LONNIE
		(V.O.)
	You're beautiful.

		CHLOE
	Tell me something I don't know...

Betty hits FAST FORWARD.  Characters flit on and off the
screen at top speed until David Ravell appears.



20     INT. WOODED ROADSIDE - NIGHT (ON TV SCREEN)		 20

Chloe's magnificent legs are folded into the seat of David's
560 SL.  She struggles with her seatbelt, so he helps her.
She makes sure their hands touch.

		CHLOE
	Thanks for pulling over, David... I can't
	go that fast without taking a breather.

		DAVID
	Sorry... it's nice to see what this
	little beauty can do, though.  I guess,
	somehow, all that speed helps me forget
	the past...

						   19.


		CHLOE
	I'm sure it does...
		(touching the seats)
	Mmm, leather.  How far do they recline?

David smiles, a little uncomfortable.

		CHLOE (cont'd)
	Listen, David, I know I've said it
	before, but I want to tell you again how
	sorry I am about your wife.
		(BEAT)
	It must make you scared to get close to
	someone again.

She puts her hand over his on the gear shift.  A moment.
Finally, he has to move her fingers to start the car.

		CHLOE (cont'd)
	Let's not go... not yet.

BETTY sits on an old couch in the den and watches, eyes glued
to the screen.  Suddenly, she hears the sound of TIRES ON
GRAVEL.  HEADLIGHTS sweep across the window.

		BETTY
	Damn!

She hits PAUSE and crosses to look out.



21     EXT. BETTY'S HOUSE - NIGHT				21

Del gets out of a black Lincoln Town Car, followed by CHARLIE
and WESLEY - the guys in the team jackets from the diner.
Charlie is 63 years old.  He wears a dress shirt, slacks and
docksiders.  The suburban father look.

Wesley is 28. He's in jeans, T-shirt and white Reeboks. Clean
cut; the kid who used to mow your parents' lawn.

Betty quickly snaps out the light and closes the door until
it is open only a crack.



22     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - NIGHT				22

Del swaggers into the house.  The two men follow politely.

		DEL
	... you can have the best damn running
	backs in the world, somebody's still
	gotta block for 'em.

						   20.


		CHARLIE
	You're a hundred percent right.  They
	rely on what's-his-name's arm too much...

Del stops and looks around, deflated by the mess.

The den is only a short flight of steps from the living room
and the kitchen.  Betty has a clean view of both from where
she sits on the couch.



23     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DEN - NIGHT		      23

She hears Del come in, but doesn't take her eyes off the TV
screen.

		DEL  (O.S.)
	My apologies, gentlemen.  I asked my wife
	to straighten this shit up before she
	went out.



23A     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT		   23A

Del crosses to an old stereo and puts on an LP.  He smiles as
the music overtakes the room.  Charlie and Wesley stand
nearby, appreciating the quaintness of the surroundings.

		DEL
	Now, what can I get you gentlemen to
	drink?

Del crosses to the cupboard.  Charlie and Wesley stand
leisurely in the living room.

		CHARLIE
	Bourbon, little water, thank you.

		WESLEY
	Beer, please.

		DEL
	You got it.

Wesley looks at a wedding portrait of Del and Betty.

		WESLEY
	Hey... you got a fine one right here!

		CHARLIE
	Wesley...
		(to Del)
	Your wife's a very lovely woman.  Have I
	seen her before?

						   21.


		DEL
	If you ate at the Tip Top you did.

		CHARLIE
	Oh, yes, with the coffee...

		DEL
	Yep, Betty pours a pretty mean cup.

Del reaches into the fridge and produces a Miller for Wesley,
then mixes two drinks and walks into the dining room and
Charlie and Wesley follow to the table and sit down.

		CHARLIE
	I like this.  I like doing business in
	the home. It's cozy...
		(noticing the card and cupcake)
	Who's birthday?

		DEL
	Ahh... my wife's.

		WESLEY
	What'd you get her?

		DEL
	Huh?  Oh, umm, a car.
		(BEAT)
	So, to a successful transaction...

They raise their glasses and drink.  Del tosses back his
drink in one gulp.



24     INT. DAVID'S CAR - WOODED ROADSIDE - (ON TV SCREEN)     24

Chloe is on top of David, kissing him on the mouth as he
resists.  He finally has to push her away forcibly, and we
hear a TEARING SOUND.  Chloe's blouse has been ripped.

		DAVID
	I'm sorry, Chloe.

She starts to cry.  David reaches out to comfort her.

		DAVID (cont'd)
	It's not that I don't find you
	attractive.  I'm just not ready...

David looks up to find her lips on his.  In spite of himself,
he gives in to the warmth of her kiss and responds hungrily.

Betty is mesmerized.

						   22.




25     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT		    25

The men have retired into the dining room, sitting or
standing around a worn wooded table.  Charlie and Wesley are
just finishing their drinks.

		DEL
	All right gentlemen, let's get down to
	it.  I need to know if you're for real.

		CHARLIE
	If we're for real?

		DEL
	You don't exactly look like drug dealers.

		WESLEY
	Isn't that the point?

		DEL
	Yeah, well,  I don't have time to screw
	around.  I got buyers in Dallas, Houston
	and Vegas who are ready to snap this
	stuff up.

		CHARLIE
	We appreciate that.  But you just poured
	me a drink, I'd like to enjoy your
	hospitality for a few minutes.

		DEL
	Fine.  You got five...

		CHARLIE
	It's a nice place you got here.  Real
	comfortable.  Sweet little town, Fair
	Oaks.  You like it here?

		DEL
		(laughs)
	Are you kidding me?  What's to like?

		WESLEY
	Seems like a nice place.

		DEL
	It is, if you like idiots...

		CHARLIE
	What do you mean?

		DEL
	It's a small town, man.  I never should
	have left Omaha.  People here think

						   23.

	small.  They act small.  They're a bunch
	of dumb fucks.

		WESLEY
	Really?

		DEL
	You better believe it.

		CHARLIE
	Could you give us an example?

		DEL
	Of what?

		CHARLIE
	I'm asking you for an example of one of
	these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.

		DEL
	I don't follow...

		CHARLIE
	You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?

		DEL
		(warily)
	No...

		CHARLIE
	I didn't think so.  So, give me an
	example of a stupid person doing a stupid
	thing.  Not being stupid, you're equipped
	to recognize it.

		DEL
	Are we gonna do business here, or not?

		WESLEY
	Relax, we brought the cash.

		CHARLIE
	I'm just curious.  Can't you give me an
	example?

		DEL
		(annoyed)
	All right ... lemme see ... okay, new
	Burger King opens up.  These assholes get
	excited and start lining up.  Like it's
	some five star restaurant.  The place is
	mobbed.  Right?

						   24.


		CHARLIE
	Hmmmm.  "Five Stars," huh?
		(BEAT)
	Is that stupid, Wesley?

		WESLEY
	No, that's ignorant.  They just don't
	know any better.

		CHARLIE
	That's what I thought.
		(to Del)
	You better give me another example.

		DEL
	This is bullshit, can we get down to
	business here, please?

Off a look from Charlie, Wesley produces a pistol and gently
nudges the barrel into Del's ear.

		DEL (CONT'D)
	Jesus Christ!

		WESLEY
	He's waiting...

		DEL
	Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.

		WESLEY
	"Injuns?"

		CHARLIE
	You did not just say "Injuns," Del.

		DEL
	The Indians, Injuns, whatever.  They're
	always drunk and doing stupid things.

		CHARLIE
	Like what?

		DEL
	Driving their cars into trees... puking
	on the sidewalk... stupid shit!

		CHARLIE
	Let's see... around here that would be
	Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not
	mistaken.

		DEL
	I... I don't know...

						   25.


		CHARLIE
	Well, my idea of stupid is very different
	from yours.
		(BEAT)
	So here's how this is gonna work.  Would
	you take your socks off, please?

		DEL
	My socks?

		WESLEY
	You heard the man.

Del slowly takes his shoes and socks off.  He's sweating,
trembling.

		CHARLIE
	I'm gonna talk to you and when I'm
	finished, you can answer.  But I don't
	like being interrupted.  Now roll them
	into a ball...

Del does it.

		DEL
	Oh, Jesus, please...  Please, God.

		CHARLIE
	... and put them in your mouth.

At a sharp look from Charlie, Del obediently stuffs the socks
into his mouth and starts to cry.  Wesley produces a roll of
duct tape and fastens Del's hands to the back of his chair.



26     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DEN - NIGHT		      26

Betty is glued to the TV, oblivious to the men.  Chloe and
David are still talking in his car.  She continues to cry.

		DAVID
		(V.O.)
	You're wonderful, Chloe, you are... But I
	just know there's something special out
	there for me.



27     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT		    27

		CHARLIE
	Now I'm gonna tell you what stupid is.
	Stupid is taking something that doesn't
	belong to you.  Right Wesley?

						   26.


		WESLEY
	That's right.

		CHARLIE
	Stupid is trying to sell it to other
	people who are, by their very nature,
	untrustworthy.

		WESLEY
	That is so right.

		CHARLIE
	Stupid is calling people in Kansas City
	who are affiliated with the rightful
	owners of the thing you stole, and trying
	to sell it to them.  Right Wesley?

		WESLEY
	Now, that's really stupid.

		CHARLIE
	So you see, we have totally different
	ideas of what's stupid and what's not.
	Don't we?

Del nods; crying, sweating.

		CHARLIE (cont'd)
	Good.  Now we're getting somewhere.  You
	agree that you were stupid?

Del nods again.  Wesley collects Charlie's glass and mixes
him another drink.  He gets a beer for himself and stands
behind Del.  Charlie sips his drink slowly, savoring it.

		CHARLIE (cont'd)
	You know, a hundred and fifty years ago
	you'd have been scalped for that remark
	about Native Americans.  Right here where
	your house is - you'd have been scalped.

		WESLEY
	Hell of a way to die.

		CHARLIE
	It wasn't always fatal, Wesley.  We could
	scalp Del right now, and he'd be plenty
	alive to tell us how it feels.

Del's eyes get huge.

		CHARLIE  (CONT'D)
	It's pretty simple, too.
		(BEAT)

						   27.

	First you take a knife and just draw a
	mark right across the hairline.

Wesley produces a long knife and traces a line across the
very top of Del's forehead.  Trickles of blood wind their way
down his brow.  Del is MOANING and PANTING through his socks.

		CHARLIE (cont'd)
	Hold still, Del, we're just talking
	here...
		(pointing to a spot)
	Then you grab a big handful of hair and
	pull as you cut.  It's amazing how easily
	the scalp comes off.

		WESLEY
	A mark, huh?

Wesley takes a jab at Del's forehead with his knife, leaving
a small cut.

Del starts twitching, rocking back and forth as Wesley grabs
a fistful of his hair.

		WESLEY (cont'd)
	Shut the fuck up!  I bleed more than that
	when I shave...

Del stops moving. He breathes furiously through his nostrils.

		CHARLIE
	Now.  I want to know the particulars of
	your stupid act:  how you got what
	doesn't belong to you, who helped you get
	it, and of course, where it is now.

Charlie pulls the socks out of Del's mouth.  Del splutters,
gasping for air.

		DEL
	It's in the Buick!  I swear to God it's
	all there!



28     INT. BLAKE DANIELS' OFFICE - DAY  (ON TV SCREEN)	28

David enters.  Blake nods to him grimly.

		DAVID
	You wanted to see me, Blake?

		BLAKE
	I wish I could say I had good news.
		(off David's look)
	David, I'll get right to the point.
	Chloe Jensen has filed charges of sexual

						   28.

	assault against you.
		(BEAT)
	You can continue to practice at L.A.
	County, but I'm afraid I have to revoke
	your privileges here at Loma Vista until
	this is resolved.

HOLD on David's shocked expression ...  MUSIC UP AS

		DEL  (O.S.)
	PLEASE DON'T KILL ME!!!

Betty's not sure what Del said, but the panic in his voice
got through.  She hits PAUSE and takes a look.



29     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT		    29

Del is facing her, tiny rivulets of blood running into his
terrified eyes.  Wesley stands at his shoulder, still holding
a handful of his hair, still poised with the knife.

		DEL
	I got it from a truck driver named Duane
	Cooley, out of Amarillo.  He brings my
	cars down from Detroit.  But I haven't
	touched it, I swear to you... Please!
	Please!  Please!

Annoyed, Charlie stuffs the socks back in Del's mouth.

Betty stares.  Her gaze shifts from Del to Wesley, drawn by
Wesley's demonic expression.

		CHARLIE
	Consider yourself lucky.  Luckier than
	those 'Injuns' you have such contempt
	for.

Wesley stares at the top of Del's head.  Betty stares at
Wesley.  Charlie walks into the kitchen for another drink.

		CHARLIE (cont'd)
	I'll tell you, if anyone got a raw deal
	it's the American Indian.  This country
	has a black mark on its soul for what was
	done to them.

Wesley's nostrils flare.  Betty leans forward.

		CHARLIE (cont'd)
	I'm all for them owning casinos, getting
	rich off the white man's greed.  It's a
	beautiful piece of irony, isn't it,
	Wesley?

						   29.


		WESLEY
	IT SURE IS!!

And with a long SCREAM, Wesley rips Del's scalp from his
head. It makes a sickening sound like fabric tearing.  For a
long moment, there is only silence.  An eerie silence.

Suddenly, Del SCREAMS into his socks and thrashes in his
seat, blood pouring down his head on all sides.

Somehow, he manages to get to his feet, the chair still taped
to him, and begins smashing into whatever is near.  Blood
flies and curios shatter as Del thunders through the room.  A
dying bull, only messier.  It's quite a show.

		CHARLIE
	JESUS CHRIST!!!

Wesley steps back, staring at the dripping scalp in his hand,
as if wondering how it got there.  Betty is transfixed,
horrified.

Charlie re-enters.  The two men look at each other over Del's
MUFFLED SCREAMS as he plows headlong into wooden paneling, a
china cabinet, and finally, back toward them near the
breakfast counter.  Del bashes blindly into it.

		CHARLIE (cont'd)
		(to Wesley)
	What the fuck is the matter with you?!

Wesley is practically foaming at the mouth, still rushing on
what he did.  Charlie draws a silenced pistol and mercifully
SHOOTS Del through the head.  The big man stops suddenly,
blinks once or twice, topples over.



30     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DEN - NIGHT		      30

Betty points her remote at the dining room and clicks it, as
if trying to make the image disappear.  Finally, she gives
up, slowly turning away from the carnage and aims at the TV.
"A Reason to Love" pauses on the face of David Ravell and
Betty sits in absolute silence.



31     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT		    31

Charlie quickly begins to hide their tracks, producing a
plastic baggie and collecting the beer cans and his own
glass.  He also wipes down the fridge as Wesley watches.

		CHARLIE
	Are you out of your mind?  You scalped
	him!

						   30.


		WESLEY
	You told me how to do it!

		CHARLIE
	That was to get him to talk!
		(BEAT)
	Get rid of that thing, will you?

Wesley crosses to the garbage can, steps on the lever.  He
looks at the scalp one more time before dropping it in.

		CHARLIE  (CONT'D)
	This is great - just great!  Now we don't
	know where the goddamn stuff is.

		WESLEY
	He told us it's in the Buick.

		CHARLIE
	We don't know which Buick, do we?

		WESLEY
	Well, why'd you shoot him?

		CHARLIE
	I had to shoot him!  It was the only
	decent thing to do.

They exit the house.

		CHARLIE  (O.S.) (cont'd)
	This is very unprofessional, Wesley.



32     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DEN - NIGHT		      32

Betty is still in the family room, staring at the TV.  She
pushes 'play' again and David Ravell begins to speak.



33     EXT. SUE ANN'S HOUSE - STREET - LATER		 33

Sue Ann comes out of her house, balancing a homemade cake in
front of her.  The candles give off an unearthly glow as she
picks her way up the Sizemore's gravel drive.



34     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DEN - SAME TIME		  34

Betty is catatonic, staring at the frozen image of David
Ravell on her TV.  Downstairs, Sue Ann comes in.

						   31.


		SUE ANN
		(O.S.)
	Happy Birthday to you!  Happy Birthday to
	you!  Happy Birthday, dear--

A terrified SCREAM as the cake lands unceremoniously on the
entryway.

ON BETTY

As she hits 'Play':

		DAVID
	... you're wonderful, Chloe, you are...
	But I just know there's something special
	out there for me.



35     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - FOYER - LATER THAT NIGHT	   35

Roy enters the foyer and looks around, carrying a pad and pen
in hand.  He hears VOICES from the kitchen, sees FLASHBULBS
going off.  He sneaks down the hall when A VOICE stops him.

		DEPUTY
	Hang on there, Roy.  Nobody comes in.

		ROY
	Elden called me.  He wants to, ahh, make
	a statement for the paper...

The deputy nods him through and Roy moves off toward the
sewing room where he has spotted Betty.



36     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - SEWING ROOM - SAME TIME		36

Betty is packing an overnight bag on her bed when Roy enters
and quietly closes the door behind him.  She is working with
a purpose, almost like a different person from the woman we
first met.  Still bright and cheerful, but with a willful
glint in her eye.  Determined.

		ROY
	Hey, Betty.  Are you okay?

		BETTY
	I'm great, good, content.
		(stopping)
	What happened to your arm, Roy?

		ROY
	Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to
	keep it wrapped for a few...

						   32.


		BETTY
	Make sure it's elevated...

		ROY
	Uh-huh.

		BETTY
	You want me to make you a sling? It's no
	problem...

Betty starts whipping a T-shirt into place but stops
abruptly. She turns curiously to Roy.

		BETTY (cont'd)
	What're you doing here, Roy?

		ROY
	Well, I was worried about you and I
	wanted to make sure you were alright...
	and I guess I was sort of hoping I could
	ask you about what happened...

		BETTY
	Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing.
	It was disgusting!

		ROY
	My God... did you get a look at who did
	it?

		BETTY
	Yes.

		ROY
	You did?  Was it anyone that you...?

		BETTY
	It was Chloe...

Sheriff Ballard enters the house, surveys the scene of the
crime where one deputy wipes blood off his boot with a paper
towel, and erupts when he sees Roy.

		BALLARD
	Hey, you guys wanna try not stepping
	directly in the evidence, please?
		(to Roy)
	Ostrey, you and your goddamn police
	scanner! I leave for ten minutes and...
	Betty, I'm sorry about this.

He motions to a female officer.

						   33.


		BALLARD (cont'd)
	Why don't you take her down to the
	station? We'll be along in a bit...

She leads Betty out the kitchen door.

		BETTY
	'Night, guys...



37     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT		    37

As Ballard leads Roy into the next room...

		BALLARD
	Okay, let's go... I got nothing for the
	record yet.

		ROY
	Oww! My arm, careful!

		BALLARD
	Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your
	bike again?

		ROY
	No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just
	mauled me a little when I layed their
	food out.

		BALLARD
	Good God...they're meat eaters, Roy, just
	drop the shit in there!

		ROY
	I can't...they prefer a more formal
	presentation. I don't usually go so close
	to the surface, but I was...

		BALLARD
	...you are so goddamn weird.
		(BEAT)
	Oh, and by the way, get the hell outta
	here!

		ROY
	No, Elden, I need to...

		BALLARD
	You need to get yourself gone from my
	crime scene. And leave Betty alone,
	she's...

						   34.


		ROY
	She knows who killed Del.  Elden, she
	said it was a woman.

		BALLARD
	It wasn't a woman.

		ROY
	Yes it was.  Betty saw the whole thing!
	Your killer's name is Chloe...

		BALLARD
	I'm tellin' you it wasn't no woman, Roy!



38     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT		    38

Ballard drags Roy into the living room, where he sees Del.
He has been turned upright and is being carefully examined.

		ROY
	Jesus...

		BALLARD
	You think a woman did that?!

Roy runs into the kitchen, covering his mouth.



39     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT		  39

Ballard and his cronies delight in watching Roy struggle with
the dry heaves. Roy runs to the kitchen sink, almost loses
it, then wipes his mouth with a paper towel.

		BALLARD
	Kinda' looks like a burnt out roman
	candle, don't he?
		(BEAT)
	Del must've sold a lemon to the wrong
	Indian, and got paid back the old
	fashioned way.  Them Kickapoos get pretty
	mean when they drink...

Roy sees Del's scalp in the garbage can as he goes to drop
his crumpled towel inside.

		ROY
	So, you think you're gonna find his scalp
	hanging in some tepee?

		BALLARD
	They no longer live in tepees, Mr.
	College Graduate.

						   35.


		ROY
	Did you send anyone out there?

		BALLARD
	You bet I did.  I got a squad car on the
	way to the reservation right now.

		ROY
	Bad idea ...

		BALLARD
	You just go write your little story, Roy.
	I'll handle the police work...

		ROY
	You better handle what's in this garbage
	can first.



40     EXT. SIZEMORE MOTORS - NIGHT			  40

Every car on the lot has its trunk open and spare tire on the
ground behind it.  Charlie and Wesley are at the last car.

		WESLEY
	I still don't understand how you knew Del
	was telling the truth.

		CHARLIE
	I saw his soul Wesley.  He was face to
	face with his God, and no one lies in
	that situation.  But your Geronimo act
	rattled me, and I abandoned my instincts.
		(BEAT)
	Never abandon you instincts.

		WESLEY
	I didn't.  You gave me a look!

		CHARLIE
	What 'look'?

		WESLEY
	That one look you got!  I thought you
	were done, so I took him out...

		CHARLIE
	I wasn't done, I was just sick of hearing
	him whine.  And you didn't take him out,
	you scalped him.  Christ, I almost puked,
	did I tell you that?

		WESLEY
	Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian
	story?

						   36.


		CHARLIE
	What the hell does that mean?  If I'd
	told a Ty Cobb story would you have
	clubbed him to death with a bat?

Wesley is stung.  Charlie slams the last trunk in disgust.
The rest remain where they are; open.

		CHARLIE (cont'd)
	It's not here.  Let's go.

		WESLEY
	You just gonna leave these cars sitting
	here like this?

		CHARLIE
	Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do
	something, now that you fucked it up.

		WESLEY
	I wanted to make a statement.

		CHARLIE
	Let me tell you something.  In our
	business you can't put food on the table
	if your phone doesn't ring.  The guys who
	get the calls are good - not flashy, just
	good.  They get in, they get out.  Nobody
	knows a goddamn thing.  Understand?
	Boom, boom, boom.  Three in the head and
	you know they're dead.

		WESLEY
	... that's a good motto.

		CHARLIE
	Fine, I'll get you a bumpersticker, but
	you better start believing it!  It's the
	only statement you need to make.



41     INT. POLICE STATION / OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT	  41

Betty is questioned in a holding room by a POLICE OFFICER and
a DOCTOR.  Ballard and Roy watch through a window.

		DOCTOR
	And did your husband know these people?

		BETTY
	Sort of...but he ignored them.

		DOCTOR
	And how did that make you feel, Betty?

						   37.


		BETTY
	I felt all cold inside.  And angry.

Ballard looks both ways to make sure he won't be overheard.

		BALLARD
	I questioned Joyce about all this...

		ROY
	Yeah?

		BALLARD
	Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol
	Del. On a regular basis, if you get my
	drift...

		ROY
	... and half the other guys in this town.
	Including you, I believe...

		BALLARD
	Junior year!

		ROY
	Anyway, so what?

		BALLARD
	So? ... Suppose Betty found out about
	them?

		ROY
	You said a woman couldn't have done it.

		BALLARD
	A woman can write a check.

		ROY
	So you're saying Betty Sizemore - our
	Betty Sizemore--who you were in swing
	choir with--has now hired somebody to
	scalp her husband in her own kitchen
	while she watched?  You're amazing.

		BALLARD
	'S just a theory...just 'cause I'm
	thinking it don't mean I like it.

The doctor comes out of the holding room.

		BALLARD (cont'd)
	How is she?

						   38.


		DOCTOR
	She's in a kind of shock. I see all the
	signs of a post-traumatic reaction with
	possible dissociative symptoms.

		BALLARD
	Could I have that in American?

		DOCTOR
	It's a type of altered state...it allows
	a traumatized person to continue
	functioning.

		BALLARD
	So she did witness it?

		ROY
	Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden.

		BALLARD
	That's it!  YOU'RE GONE!

He spins Roy around and marches him toward the door, one arm
bent behind his back.

		ROY
	Oww, the arm, the arm!

		BALLARD
	You just don't know when to quit, Roy!
	You were jealous of me when I got hall
	monitor in seventh grade, and you're
	still jealous now!!!

		ROY
	One question, Doctor, please! (outside
	the door) You can't do this! I'm the
	press, I have rights!!

		BALLARD
	That's right, you have the right to
	remain silent.

Ballard pushes Roy out the door. As he returns, Roy reappears
behind him, leaning in to listen. Ballard doesn't see him.

		BALLARD (cont'd)
	Sorry you had to see that. You were
	saying?

		DOCTOR
	I was saying that it seems probable that
	she witnessed the murder, but her memory
	of it is gone, at least for the time
	being. I also think you ought to have her

						   39.

	stay with someone tonight.
		(BEAT)
	Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are?

		BALLARD
	No... Friends from the diner maybe?

		DOCTOR
	Well, you should find out.  She keeps
	talking about them...

Ballard nods, sure he's got a clue here. He looks in at Betty
again, just as she begins repacking her travel bag.  He
frowns at this, his suspicions fueled all the more.



42     EXT. SUE ANN'S HOUSE - NIGHT			  42

A police car pulls up to Sue Ann's house.  Betty gets out,
carrying her overnight bag.  Sue Ann appears, embraces her
and leads her inside.



43     INT. SUE ANN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER		43

Betty lies down in a bright red race car bed.  Sue Ann tucks
her in and turns out the light.

		SUE ANN
	Let me know if you need anything, okay?

		BETTY
	Are you and Larry happy?

		SUE ANN
	Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.

		BETTY
	Then you should treasure that... you
	gotta hold on to whatever you got that's
	any good, even if it's only a little bit.

		SUE ANN
	All you been through... I ever tell you
	what a good friend you are?

		BETTY
	All the time...

		SUE ANN
	Well, you are.

After a beat...

						   40.


		BETTY
	Something bad happened to Del and me,
	didn't it?

		SUE ANN
	Yeah, hon.  Real bad.  You just get some
	sleep, everything's gonna be fine.

		BETTY
	Sue Ann, I'm sorry about all this, but I
	just know there's something special out
	there for me...

Sue Ann looks down at her friend, troubled.  She strokes
Betty's hair gently and kisses her.  After she leaves, Betty
lies awake, staring at the ceiling.  A mobile dangles
overhead.

LATER

The Mickey Mouse clock on the wall reads 3:30.  Beneath it,
Betty is sitting up in bed, wide awake.



44     INT. SUE ANN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT		  44

Betty comes down the stairs without a sound. She finds a pen
and paper near the phone and writes a note.

INSERT:		Dear Del:
			   This is the hardest thing I've ever done and I can't
			   even face you.  But I need to be honest.  We haven't
			   been happy for a long time. You always say people
			   need their space, and now you'll have some.  I'm
			   sorry.

			   Betty

She takes off her wedding band and puts it on the table.



45     EXT. BETTY'S HOUSE/GARAGE - NIGHT		     45

Betty raises the garage door, tosses her overnight bag and
birthday money envelope into the LeSabre, and gets in.
She drives through Fair Oaks, past the town limits.  She
keeps on driving until her car recedes into the moonlit
prairie horizon.

						   41.




46     EXT./INT. LESABRE - DRIVING - NIGHT		   46

She comes to a sudden halt in front of the "You are Leaving
Kansas" billboard.  She stares hard at it through the
windshield.  Suddenly, she hits the gas and bolts off along
the Oklahoma blacktop.  She never looks back.



47     INT. BETTY'S LESABRE - THE NEXT DAY		   47

Betty yawns, looks at her watch and increases her speed.
When she sees a sign for a MOTEL ahead, she pulls off the
highway.



48     EXT. TRUCK STOP/MOTEL - DAY			   48

She parks at a truck stop/restaurant/motel complex, hops out
and runs to the motel office window.



49     INT. TRUCK STOP - MOTEL ROOM - DAY		    49

Betty enters her room, immediately turns on the TV, and plops
down on the bed.

		VOICE (V.O.)
	And now we return to "A Reason to Love."



50     EXT. TRUCK STOP/MOTEL PARKING LOT - SAME TIME	   50

A crowded truck stop in the Texas flatlands.  THREE TRUCK
DRIVERS in jeans, flannel shirts and denim jackets walk
across the parking lot.

One is an old, grizzled veteran with a salt-and-pepper
stubble and a greasy CAT cap on his head.  It's CHARLIE.
Next to him is DUANE, a burly young driver in fancy cowboy
boots.  Flanking Duane is WESLEY.

		WESLEY
	So you got Asian women?

		DUANE
		(Southern accent)
	Sure, I got Asian.  Got black, white, any
	color you like, video and magazine.  Got
	fat chicks and animals too, if you want
	'em.  They're extra...

		CHARLIE
	Mmmm.  Well, it was a piece of luck
	running into you, Duane. I thought I was

						   42.

	gonna have to take Wesley out and hose
	him down.  All he talks about is those
	Japanese gals.

		WESLEY
	I like 'em small.  When you're inside a
	little Asian chick, it's like your dick
	is the axle that holds her body together.

		DUANE
	That's nicely put.  You outta get
	yourself to Thailand...

They reach Duane's truck, an empty car-carrier with Michigan
plates, and climb up into the cab.



51     INT. DUANE'S TRUCK - DAY				  51

Two Confederate flags criss-cross over Duane's CB unit.  On
the dashboard is a Rebel flag pin, a bumper sticker that says
"The South Will Rise Again" and a dozen country music tapes.

Duane gets in the sleeper cab, where stacks of porno tapes
and magazines reach the ceiling.  Wesley takes the driver's
seat, Charlie, the passenger seat.

		CHARLIE
	What part of Dixie are you from, Duane?

		DUANE
	Georgia.  In case I didn't tell you, it's
	cash only, gentlemen.

		WESLEY
	We can live with that.

		CHARLIE
	I'm a Yankee, myself.  Massachusetts.

Duane passes two videos to Wesley.

		DUANE
	Here's Ghengis Kunt and The Demilitarized
	Zone. Get it?
		(laughs)
	They're Korean, so they're pretty hot.

		CHARLIE
	You know, it's interesting.  The South
	lost the Civil War, but they still seem
	to get all the glory.

		DUANE
	Huh?

						   43.


		CHARLIE
	Jeb Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson
	Davis - they're all losers in my book.

Charlie smiles.  Duane stops digging through the videotapes.

		DUANE
	The fuck you talking about?

		CHARLIE
	Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.

		DUANE
		(to Wesley)
	He goin' crazy on us, or what?

		CHARLIE
	Did you know the most brutal, inhumane
	prison of the entire war was in Georgia?

		DUANE
	Really.  And where was that, old man?

		CHARLIE
	Andersonville.
		(BEAT)
	They did horrible things to men there...



52     INT. CHLOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - (ON TV SCREEN)	 52

Chloe is curled up on her white leather sofa, cowering as
Lonnie hovers over her accusingly.

		LONNIE
	I think you better tell me what's going
	on here, Chloe.

		CHLOE
	I just feel... funny about what we did.

		LONNIE
		(laughs)
	You feel guilty?  Let me remind you of
	something, sweetheart.  You're in this up
	to those fabulous eyes of yours.
	Understand?

The camera holds on her face for a melodramatic beat ...
Chloe's trapped, and she knows it.

PULL BACK to reveal Betty lying on the bed in her motel room,
out cold.

						   44.




53     INT. DUANE'S TRUCK - LATER				53

The flag poles over the CB unit are bare. Duane is in the
sleeper cab, his forearms bound to his thighs with duct tape.
A telltale piece of Confederate red fabric hangs out of his
mouth.  There is a purplish bruise on his forehead.  He's
quiet, but glowering at his captors.

		CHARLIE
	... So, at a rest stop outside Logansport
	you noticed that two guys were slipping
	something extra in one of your cars, and
	you decided to see what it was.  Then you
	figured you'd take this valuable
	commodity and go into business yourself,
	even though it didn't belong to you.  But
	you needed a crackerjack salesman to move
	it, so you made the biggest mistake of
	your short life and chose Del.  Sound
	right so far?

Duane nods.

		CHARLIE (cont'd)
	Del's dead, by the way.  I sent him to
	the Great Beyond.

		WESLEY
	Actually, I scalped him, and then you
	killed him.

Duane narrows his eyes in disbelief.

		CHARLIE
	Exactly.
		(BEAT)
	Now, the one thing I don't get is that we
	checked all the Buicks on that lot.  Four
	'97 LeSabres and nothing in 'em.

Duane smiles mockingly.

		CHARLIE (CONT'D)
	Ohhh ... There weren't four, were there?

Charlie reaches up above the visor and pulls down a rumpled
manifest.  He leafs through it.

		CHARLIE (cont'd)
	There were five, damn it!  I should have
	known!!  Goddamn...
		(BEAT)
	So, what happened to the fifth car?

						   45.


Duane shrugs his shoulders.

		CHARLIE (CONT'D)
	You know you're going to die, don't you,
	Duane?
		(Duane nods)
	And you really don't know where that
	other LeSabre is, do you?

Duane shakes his head.  Charlie sighs, resigned.

		CHARLIE (cont'd)
	He's telling the truth.  He doesn't know.

		WESLEY
	Should I kill him now?

		CHARLIE
	Wait.  Any last words, General Lee?

Duane nods emphatically.  Wesley pulls the Confederate flags
out of his mouth.

		DUANE
	Suck my dick, you Yankee piece of shit.

He spits in Wesley's face.  Charlie has to restrain Wesley.

		CHARLIE
	God, I admire that.  Ya see that, Wesley?
	That's why they get all the glory.

Charlie climbs down from the big rig and heads across the
parking lot. The Town Car is parked near the adjacent motel,
just a few spaces away from Betty's LeSabre.

With a furious calm Wesley wipes his face, then takes out a
can of lighter fluid, sets it on the dash and looks at Duane.

		WESLEY
	...why'd you spit on me?



54     EXT. TRUCK STOP/MOTEL PARKING LOT - DUSK		    54

Charlie pulls the Town Car alongside Duane's rig and drums
the steering wheel impatiently.  It begins to rain.  There
are flashes of LIGHTNING in the distance.

		CHARLIE
	Come on, Wesley, three shots.

A FLASH OF ORANGE FLAME ignites inside Duane's cab.  Charlie
sighs.  Finally, THREE DULL THUDS reverberate from inside.
Wesley climbs down clutching a videotape and gets in the car.

						   46.


		CHARLIE (cont'd)
	What the hell was that, another
	statement?

		WESLEY
	Well, no one ever spit in my face before.
	Especially some cracker fuck.

		CHARLIE
	You have to rise above it.  The
	professionals rise above that kind of
	thing...

As they drive away FLAMES are beginning to dance inside the
cab.



55     INT. TRUCK STOP/MOTEL ROOM - EVENING		  55

The FLICKERING LIGHT of the TV screen is the only light.
Betty lies asleep on the bed.  The NEWS comes on and she
starts to stir as ...

		NEWSCASTER
	... small town of Fair Oaks ... has left
	people shaken ... owner-manager of
	Sizemore Motors ...

Betty sits up.  On the TV screen is a shot of Del as Julius
Caesar from one of his commercials.

		NEWSCASTER
		(cont'd)
	... police are still investigating.

She blinks at the screen, confused, as the next story comes
on. Betty reaches for the phone.



56     INT. POLICE STATION - EVENING			 56

Ballard is doing paperwork. Roy is asleep on a nearby bench.
A DEPUTY picks up a ringing phone and hands it to Ballard.

		DEPUTY
	Sheriff, it's Betty Sizemore, on two!

		BALLARD
	SHHH!... (Whispering) BETTY?   WHERE ARE
	YOU?

						   47.




57     INT. TRUCK STOP/MOTEL ROOM - ON BETTY		 57

		BETTY
	I'm in a motel.  Has something happened
	to Del?  Did he do something stupid?

		BALLARD (V.O.)
	BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU...IN PERSON!
	WHERE'RE YOU AT?

		BETTY
	IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT!  I'M NOT
	COMING BACK!

		BALLARD (V.O.)
	GODAMMIT, BETTY! ... WHO'S CHLOE?

		BETTY
	I'M THROUGH TALKING NOW!  GOODBYE!

She hangs up. HEADLIGHTS sweep across the curtains, startling
her.



58     INT. BETTY'S LESABRE - MOVING - DAY		   58

Betty crosses the border from Texas into New Mexico.  She
grips the wheel intently, driving for all she's worth.



59     OMIT						  59



60     EXT. FAIR OAKS TRAILER PARK - LATE AFTERNOON		60

Betty's blue Corsica sits surrounded by yellow police tape.
Half a dozen COPS mill around.  To one side are several
REPORTERS and PHOTOGRAPHERS, Roy included.  A FEW RESIDENTS
mill around in the background.

A stack of pictures of Betty sit on a makeshift table.

		REPORTER #1
	Who witnessed Ms. Sizemore driving here?

		BALLARD
	The Assistant Manager, Mr. Wylie.

		REPORTER #2
	But he couldn't identify the male
	passenger?

						   48.


		BALLARD
	Only to say he was wearing green.

		ROY
	What if the killers didn't see her?  You
	published her picture - you're gonna get
	her killed!

		BALLARD
	No, we're bringing the community into the
	effort to find her.

		ROY
	You're lying!

		BALLARD
	I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.
		(the reporters hush)
	That's right.  There's no doubt in my
	mind, folks... she's on the run.  Whether
	or not she's mixed up in all this remains
	to be seen...

		ROY
	That's bullshit, Sheriff!  You think
	she's a suspect!

		BALLARD
	I'd like to apologize for our local boy.
	He's been in love with Betty since the
	fifth grade, y'see.  He means well, but
	he's in over his head on this.



61     INT. TIP TOP DINER - NEXT MORNING		     61

CLOSE SHOT of a headline in the Wichita Eagle:  "EYE WITNESS
TO BRUTAL MURDER MISSING" over a picture of Betty. Charlie is
one of MANY CUSTOMERS reading a copy. Wesley is plowing
through a stack of pancakes.

		WESLEY
	So how do we know that car's still in
	Fair Oaks?

		CHARLIE
	We don't.  But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy
	to find if it's here, town this size...
		(BEAT)
	He said he gave his wife some car as a
	gift, remember?

Charlie turns the page for emphasis and studies Betty's
features.

						   49.


		CHARLIE (cont'd)
	This is bad, Wesley.  Very, very bad.

Wesley happily adds three strips of bacon brought by A
WAITRESS, who wears a button with the word "Missing" over
Betty's face.

		CHARLIE (cont'd)
	... extremely bad.

Wesley finally looks up, directly at the picture of Betty.

		CHARLIE (cont'd)
	Did you hear what I said?

Wesley nods, his mouth stuffed with food.

		CHARLIE (cont'd)
	Maybe you don't appreciate the gravity of
	this situation.  It's bad enough that we
	don't have what we came here for.  It's
	worse that we don't know where it is. And
	now this.
		(points at the headline)
	This was supposed to be my last job.  I
	already put the deposit down on my boat.
		(BEAT)
	How can you eat at a time like this?  I
	get nauseous just watching you...

		WESLEY
	I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap
	that woman.  I can eat because they
	aren't looking for us.  And I can eat
	'cause I'm fucking hungry...
		(off Charlie's look)
	... relax.  She's gonna end up on a milk
	carton and that's about it.

		CHARLIE
	I hope you're right...

		WESLEY
	... I know I am.  Let's just do what we
	gotta do here, and get the fuck gone.

They sit for a moment in silence.  Wesley swallowing without
chewing and Charlie studying Betty's photo.

		CHARLIE
	She got out of town awfully fast. And
	wasn't she quiet in that house?  I think
	most women would have screamed, don't
	you?  I know they would've...
		(BEAT)

						   50.

	We could be dealing with a cunning,
	ruthless woman...



62     INT./EXT. SUE ANN'S HOUSE - DAY		       62

Sue Ann opens her front door to find Wesley standing before
her.  It's a new Wesley:  glasses, conservative suit, and a
convincingly humble manner.

		WESLEY
	Mrs. Rogers?  I'm Dwight Campbell, with
	Neighborly Life Insurance.  I'm looking
	for Betty Sizemore.

		SUE ANN
	I wish I could help you, but I can't.

Wesley is hit by a flying action figure.  He doesn't flinch.
Kids run by.

		WESLEY
	Aren't they precious?
		(BEAT)
	Ma'am, she has a substantial death
	benefit coming to her from the tragic
	loss of her husband.  Does she have any
	relatives in the area?

		SUE ANN
	No.
		(BEAT)
	Well, her grandparents are down in
	Oklahoma, but that's it...

		WESLEY
	I see.  And are you in touch with Mrs.
	Sizemore?

		SUE ANN
	No.  But I'm taping her show every day so
	she can watch it when she comes back.

		WESLEY
	Her show?

		SUE ANN
	"A Reason to Love."

Wesley's eyes light up.  He can't help himself.

		WESLEY
	I see.
		(BEAT)
	Did Chloe testify?

						   51.


		SUE ANN
		(reassuring)
	I don't think she will. She's a slut, but
	I just don't think she's that mean.
	Jasmine'll bring her around...

		WESLEY
	Jasmine... Do you have yesterday's show
	on tape, by any chance?

Sue Ann holds the door open, smiling, and Wesley enters.



63     INT. TIP TOP DINER - KANSAS - DAY		     63

Charlie nurses a cup of coffee at the counter while talking
to Darlene.  His Federal Marshall's badge rests on the
counter.  Shehands him two photos of Betty taken at her
birthday celebration. In one she's holding the cardboard
David Ravell.  The other, a closeup shot.

		CHARLIE
	... and how long did she work here?

		DARLENE
	Oh, five years, give or take.

		CHARLIE
	Hmm... you two in high school together?

		DARLENE
	Aren't you a sweetheart... no, not quite.
	Anyway, she's been with us awhile.

		CHARLIE
	But she wanted more out of life, right?

		DARLENE
	No... she just wanted something outta
	life.  Anything.  And with Del, she
	wasn't getting nothing.  That's her
	husband, Del.  I'm sorry about what
	happened and all, but that's the way I
	feel about all of this...

		CHARLIE
	I see.
		(holding up photos)
	May I?

		DARLENE
	If it helps bring her back, be my
	guest...

						   52.


		CHARLIE
	Thank you for your cooperation.
		(BEAT)
	Just one more thing... did she ever talk
	about getting rich?

		DARLENE
	... who doesn't?

Darlene tries to smile and returns to the kitchen.  Charlie
studies the snapshots, comparing them.



64     INT. APARTMENT/BEDROOM - DAY			  64

Wesley is in bed on top of Joyce, humping her slowly.

		WESLEY
	... and what kind of car does she drive?

		JOYCE
	Well, she wanted a LeSabre, but Del made
	her use that blue Corsica...
		(BEAT)
	So, is this what you boys'd call 'pumping
	me for information?'

Joyce GIGGLES as Wesley stops moving.

		WESLEY
	Did you say LeSabre?

		JOYCE
	Look, she didn't kill Del over no car if
	that's what you're thinking.

		WESLEY
	But she could have taken one, right?

With her knees, Joyce prods him into humping her again.

		JOYCE
	Maybe, but I don't think she had the
	nerve. I know her.  And I'm a pretty good
	judge of character...

Joyce reaches for a cigarette on the nightstand and takes a
deep drag. Wesley closes his eyes and turns away, offended.

		WESLEY
	... yeah, I can see that.

						   53.




65     EXT. DESERT ROAD - WILLIAMS, ARIZONA - DAY		  65

Betty drives along a lonely stretch of highway that slowly
reveals a desert town in the distance.



66     INT. CANYON RANCH BAR - DAY			   66

Big ol' place.  Lots of wood and red leather.  Betty rushes
in as the clock on the wall reads 2:58.  The Town Drunk,
MERLE, is alone at the bar watching "Bass Masters" on a huge
TV screen.  In front of him is a remote control.  A FEW
OTHERS at tables.

Betty sidles up to the bar and sits down.  She looks at
Merle, at the clock, at the remote.

		BETTY
	Would you mind very much if I changed the
	channel at three o'clock?

		MERLE
	Yes.

He BURPS, then finally looks at her with bleary eyes.

		BETTY
	Please?  It's very important to me.  "A
	Reason to Love" comes on at three around
	here.

He ignores her.  Betty puts her wallet on the bar.

		BETTY (cont'd)
	I'll give you money.

Merle SLAMS his hand down on the bar, scaring her.

		MERLE
	 ARE YOU DEAF?!!

It's 3:01. ELLEN DRABER, 40's, appears behind the bar, looks
at the clock and takes the remote from Merle.  She changes
the channel to "A Reason to Love" as the opening titles end.

Betty can't believe it. Merle smiles at her wickedly.

		MERLE (cont'd)
	Please keep it down, it's time for "A
	Reason to Love..."

						   54.


		BETTY
	That's real funny.  Why don't you have
	another drink?

		ELLEN
	What's the matter here?

		BETTY
	I begged him to let me put that on!

		ELLEN
	He's a prick.  Merle?... You're a prick.

MERLE grunts in reply.  Ellen turns back to Betty.

		ELLEN (CONT'D)
	So you're into "Reason," too?  Finally,
	someone civilized!  I'm Ellen, what can I
	get you?

		BETTY
	Hi, I'm Betty.  I'll take a Miller, if
	you got it...



67     INT. CHLOE'S APARTMENT - DAY  (ON TV SCREEN)		67

Chloe paces in front of her white sofa, a matching white
telephone in her hand.  She looks worried.

		ELLEN (O.S.)
	What's that bitch up to now?

We hear the BEEP TONE of an answering machine.

		CHLOE
	Lonnie?  It's Chloe.  We need to talk ...
	I don't think I can go through with this.

She hangs up.  The camera stays on her for a melodramatic
beat of introspection as we GO TO COMMERCIAL.



68     INT. CANYON RANCH BAR - RETURN TO BAR		 68

		BETTY
	Do you have a phone?

Ellen swings a phone up onto the bar.

		ELLEN
	If it's long distance you can leave me a
	buck when you're done.

Betty dials ...

						   55.


		BETTY
	Sue Ann?  It's Betty. I just wanted to
	let you know I'm okay ... Huh?  I'm at
	the Canyon Ranch Bar in ...
		(looks at Ellen)

		MERLE
	Phoenix...

		ELLEN
	Shut up, Merle... Williams.

		BETTY
	Williams, Arizona.  About halfway there,
	I guess.



69     INT. SUE ANN'S HOUSE - DAY				69

Sue Ann is in her kitchen, ignoring the pleas of all three
children.

		SUE ANN
	Halfway where? You've gotta come home.
	We've been worried sick about you.  Are
	you alright?

		BETTY (V.O.)
	Sue Ann, I thought you of all people
	would back me up on this, you know what
	Del's like.  How did he take my note?

		SUE ANN
	Betty, honey, listen to me.  A man came
	by from Mutual Life Insurance.  He says
	you've got money comin' to you from Del's
	policy.
		(BEAT)
	Del's life insurance policy-- Are you
	with me?

		BETTY (V.O.)
	What are you talking about?



70     INT. CANYON RANCH BAR - DAY			   70

"A REASON TO LOVE" comes back on the TV.

		BETTY
	Tell Del I'm sorry.  I left so quick, but
	I need to do this.

		SUE ANN (V.O.)
	Do what?

						   56.


		BETTY
	I gotta go.

		SUE ANN (V.O.)
	Betty!  Listen to me!  Del is ...

Betty hangs up.



71     INT. COCKTAIL LOUNGE - NIGHT (ON TV SCREEN)		 71

David is at a bar staring into his drink. Lonnie is with him.

		LONNIE
	How you holding up, amigo?

		DAVID
	I just wish I knew why she's doing it.

		LONNIE
	Yeah. Women are an unsolved mystery.

		ELLEN (O.S.)
	If that little weasel ever walked in here
	I wouldn't serve him.

		BETTY (O.S.)
	I'd slap his face.

		ELLEN (O.S.)
	I'd kick him in the nuts, if I thought he
	had any.

					  DISSOLVE TO:



72     INT. CANYON RANCH BAR - LATER			 72

There are two empty beer bottles in front of Betty. The THEME
MUSIC and CLOSING CREDITS of "A Reason to Love" are playing.
Betty pushes the phone back across the bar.

		ELLEN
	Where you headed, Betty?

		BETTY
	Los Angeles, California.

		ELLEN
	And you called your friend, and she's
	telling you not to go?
		(Betty nods)
	When I went to Europe my friends told me
	I was crazy.

						   57.


		BETTY
	Europe?  The Europe?
		(laughs)
	This is my first time out of Kansas.

		ELLEN
	I should call you Dorothy.
		(BEAT)
	When I left here I went straight to
	Italy.  Everybody told me not to go.  But
	I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw
	Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and
	goddamnit, I went.

		BETTY
	Did you love it?

		ELLEN
	Sure I loved it!  It was great.

Ellen rinses a few glasses as she talks to Betty.

		ELLEN (CONT'D)
	Let me tell you something.  I got groped
	by these Tunisian guys who thought I was
	a slut for wearing shorts, it was hotter
	than stink the whole time, and I got some
	kind of weird gum disease from the water.
	Plus, it ended my marriage--

		BETTY
	That's horrible!

		ELLEN
	No, he was a toad. Even more of a toad
	than Merle... I just wear the ring to
	keep the flies away.  Rome was the best
	thing I ever did, because I DID IT!  And
	I swear to you, it changed me.  I've been
	to Rome, Italy!  I sat every morning at
	the Cafe Sistina and had my cappuccino,
	and watched the pilgrims walk to mass,
	and no one can ever take that away from
	me.

Betty leans across the bar conspiratorially.  She looks at
Merle to make sure he won't hear her.

		BETTY
	I left my husband two days ago.

		ELLEN
	Really?

						   58.


		BETTY
	I'm getting back with my ex-fianc.  He
	proposed to me right around here, so I
	guess this is just sort of a sentimental
	stop...

		ELLEN
	Wait, I thought you said you'd never been
	outta Kansas...

		BETTY
	Oh.  I mean, except for that.
		(BEAT)
	Yep.  I'm trading in a car dealer for a
	heart specialist, so that's pretty
	good...

		ELLEN
	Nice move.  Cedars Sinai?

		BETTY
	No.  Loma Vista.

		ELLEN
		(laughs)
	I s'pose his name's David Ravell.

		BETTY
		(truly shocked)
	How did you know?

		ELLEN
	What's his real name?

		BETTY
	Dr. David Ravell.

		ELLEN
	You mean... George McCord, the actor?

		BETTY
	No, I mean David Ravell. He's a surgeon.

Ellen looks at Betty.

		ELLEN
	Yeah, I know, we just watched him
	together, remember?  Up there on the TV.
		(off Betty's earnest look)
	Good God Almighty ... You're serious.
	I've heard about people like you.

Ellen whistles, wipes the bar down to buy a few seconds.
Merle looks over at Betty, then catches Ellen's eye.

						   59.


		ELLEN (CONT'D)
	Piss off, Merle.
		(to Betty)
	So how you gonna find him, Betty?

		BETTY
	I'll go to the Hospital.

		ELLEN
	What if you can't find him?  What if you
	get out there, and nothing's the way you
	thought it was gonna be?

		BETTY
	Like Rome?

		ELLEN
	Worse.

		BETTY
	You made out alright.

		ELLEN
	Yeah, but at least I knew Rome was gonna
	be there when I arrived...

Ellen walks to the end of the bar and starts rinsing glasses.
After a beat, Betty gets up and moves down close to her.

		BETTY
	Ellen, this is the biggest thing I've
	ever done, but I've gotta do it.

		ELLEN
	You take care of yourself then, Betty,
	and don't let anybody stop you...

		BETTY
	To tell you the truth, I can't believe
	I've made it this far.  It may not be
	Europe, but I just know there's something
	special out there for me...

Ellen looks into Betty's eyes - sees the innocence, the hope
and enthusiasm - and has to look away. Betty takes it as her
cue to leave. She smiles, puts two dollars on the bar near
the phone and leaves.  Ellen stands perfectly still, watching
the door.

		MERLE
	What planet is she from?

						   60.




73     INT. BETTY'S LESABRE - GRAND CANYON - MOVING - DAY      73

Betty approaches the GRAND CANYON, driving slowly along the
South Rim, searching for a specific spot.  Finally, she pulls
over abruptly. This is it. We can tell by the joy in her
expression.



74     EXT. GRAND CANYON - DAY				   74

Betty walks to the rail and gazes out at the canyon. Turning
her head slowly, as if expecting it, she sees DAVID RAVELL
leaning on the rail about twenty feet away, clutching a
bouquet of roses.

Betty starts toward him... he starts toward her... A magic
moment... Shattered when a black sedan appears, inching its
way along. She freezes. David vanishes, and ...
An ELDERLY MAN helps his wife out of the car and snaps her
picture in front of the canyon.  Betty moves away.



75     INT. LINCOLN TOWN CAR - KANSAS - MOVING - NIGHT	 75

Charlie and Wesley drive across Kansas farm country.

		CHARLIE
	So she gets rid of the asshole and is set
	for life in the same day.

		WESLEY
	You think so?  Joyce says she's timid.

		CHARLIE
	Joyce was screwing Del.

		WESLEY
	... among others.

		CHARLIE
	I'd say that about torches her
	credibility, wouldn't you?

		WESLEY
	Yeah, well, if the wife's trying to sell
	it she'll fuck up.  She's an amateur,
	just like Del was.

The CAR PHONE RINGS.  Charlie answers.

						   61.


		CHARLIE
	Maybe...
		(into phone)
	Yes?

		SUE ANN (V.O.)
	Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?

		CHARLIE
	Sorry, you've got the wrong number.

He hangs up.

		CHARLIE	  (CONT'D)
	No, I see Betty as a Midwestern Stoic
	type.  Ice water in her veins.  A clear
	thinker.  Probably a Swede or a Finn.

		WESLEY
	A 'Finn?'  What is a Finn?

		CHARLIE
	You should read more.  Listen to me.  I
	think this woman was waiting for a chance
	to do this, and we gave it to her.  She
	kept to herself for years, living with a
	pompous asshole.  Then she sees her
	opportunity, and BOOM! - she leaves that
	little mudpatch in the dust.  These
	heartlanders can't figure it out, 'cause
	that's not their sweet little Betty.
	Hah!  We've been tracking her for, what,
	three days and I already understand her
	better'n most the people in that shitty
	little burg.

Charlie pulls out the close-up photo and studies it.

		CHARLIE (cont'd)
	Betty, Betty, Betty...

		WESLEY
	So what the fuck's a Finn?

		CHARLIE
	Oh, for Chrissakes.  It just means the
	kind of person who can eat shit for a
	long time without complaining, then cut
	their momma's throat and go dancing the
	same night.

		WESLEY
	Like... us?

						   62.


		CHARLIE
	No,... like a worthy adversary, Wesley.
	Like a very worthy adversary.

76A     INT. ROY'S APARTMENT - DAY			   76A

Roy approaches his fish tank cautiously.  He leans down and
looks at the piranha as a TV commercial ends and "A Reason to
Love" comes on.

He then returns to his computer, struggling to find the right
words and to type them with only one hand.  He types a
little, stares at the screen, then deletes an entire sentence
one character at a time, hammering on the 'Delete' key.  He
glances up at the television as the words 'Chloe' and
'Lonnie' are repeated.



77     INT. POLICE STATION - BALLARD'S OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY   77

Roy and Sue Ann go straight to Ballard's office, where they
find him at his desk eating lunch out of tupperware
containers.  He wears a napkin tucked into his shirt-top.

		BALLARD
	What the hell do you want?...  Hey, Sue
	Ann, what's up?

		ROY
	We think we know where Betty is.

		BALLARD
	Ah, shit... Do I have to hear this now?

		SUE ANN
	What's with the tupperware, Elden, did
	Meredith run outta baggies?

		BALLARD
	No reason to get a plate dirty.

		ROY
	I see you're sticking to the diet Betty
	put you on...

		BALLARD
	Worry about your own goddamn lunch!

		ROY
		(excited; to Sue Ann)
	Tell him what you told me.

						   63.


		SUE ANN
	Betty is a big, big fan of the soap
	opera, "A Reason to Love." Look...

She tosses a copy of "Soap Opera Digest" on the desk. Ballard
ignores it and keeps eating.

		BALLARD
	Why do I need to see this?  Did he ask
	you to...?

		ROY
	Listen!  I saw 'Chloe' and 'Lonnie' on
	T.V.  They're television characters.

		SUE ANN
	Betty's in love with Dr. David Ravell,
	from the show.  What if she's out in Los
	Angeles looking for him?  The actor, I
	mean...

		BALLARD
	That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

		ROY
	Yeah?  Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday
	from Arizona.

		BALLARD
	She said she was in Arizona, did she?

		ROY &amp; SUE ANN
	Yes!!

		BALLARD
	You people are even more stupid than I
	thought.  The woman's on the run and
	she's gonna just phone in her location?

		SUE ANN
	Come on, Elden, she's not on the run.
	Couldn't you at least call the Los
	Angeles Police Department?

		ROY
	You gotta do that much.

		BALLARD
	Hey, I'm the law.  I don't gotta do
	nothing...

78     EXT. FARMHOUSE - OKLAHOMA - DAY		       78

The Lincoln pulls into the dusty, overgrown driveway and
front yard of a derelict farm.



79     INT. FARMHOUSE / KITCHEN - DAY			79

The remains of pie and coffee on the table, Charlie and
Wesley kick back with JERROLD BLAINE and his wife ELIZABETH,
both in their 80's.  Photos of Betty at various ages lie
scattered in front of them.

Charlie holds up a picture of a young Betty in ballerina
costume posing at the barre.  He studies it intently.

		ELIZABETH
	This is Betty at twelve.

		CHARLIE
	Very graceful.  Perfect form.

		ELIZABETH
	Betty was a lovely child.

		JERROLD
	And she always had such spirit!  But,
	after her mother died...

		WESLEY
	Would you say she was ambitious?

		JERROLD
	Oh, there's no tellin' what that girl
	could've accomplished, and she never had
	it easy.  Never really had a childhood...
	caring for her father, going to school.

Charlie admires a photo of Betty, around 18 years old.  He
continues to rummage through a box of collectibles, pocketing
a small child's diary when it is convenient.

		CHARLIE
	Wise beyond her years, I'm sure, and such
	poise, too.
		(quietly)
	Very, very impressive...

		WESLEY
	Well, then, did you ever get any
	indication that she wanted to leave her
	husband?

						   65.


		ELIZABETH
	I don't like talking bad about the dead,
	but now that he's gone I can tell you she
	put up with things in that marriage I
	wouldn't have.  And yes, she, of all
	people, was the one who defended him.
	And that's why what that sheriff said
	makes me so angry.

		CHARLIE
	What do you mean?

		ELIZABETH
	If anyone had paid to have that husband
	of hers killed, it would have been me.

		CHARLIE
		(taking her hand)
	Mrs. Blaine?  I can tell you right now,
	without a doubt, that your granddaughter
	is alive, and did not kill Del Sizemore.

		JERROLD
	You've got to be missing a piece of your
	soul to kill someone. That's not our
	Betty...

		WESLEY
		(defensive)
	... why do you think you have to be
	missing a piece of your soul to kill
	somebody?

		JERROLD
	Because it ain't natural, young man.

		WESLEY
	What are you talking about?  Killing's
	totally natural.  It's dying that isn't
	natural...

		CHARLIE
		(covering)
	My partner's still young, Mr. Blaine, and
	he loves his job.
		(laughs)
	He'd like to kill all the criminals
	himself!

83     INT. BETTY'S LESABRE/ EXT. COUNTY USC HOSPITAL - MOVING -83
AFTERNOON

Betty drives through Boyle Heights - East L.A., holding a map
and checking street signs.  She is wearing a brand new
Nurse's uniform.  Up ahead, she sees the hillside complex of
L.A. County/USC Hospital.  Hurriedly, she pulls over and
checks herself in the visor mirror.  She is underwhelmed.

		BETTY
	God... I still look like a waitress.



84     INT. HOSPITAL - CHIEF NURSE'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON	84

The CHIEF NURSE, a large, dynamic woman in her 50's, faces
Betty across her desk.

		CHIEF NURSE
	Of course, I don't know every doctor who
	works here...

		BETTY
	Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the
	staff.  You must know him.  He's
	incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate.
	He's being sued for sexual assault right
	now, but--
		(Off Chief Nurse's look)
	It's not true.  He was set up.

		CHIEF NURSE
	Well, I certainly would have heard about
	that.

		BETTY
	Of course, he's only here two days a
	week.  He's also on staff over at Loma
	Vista.

		CHIEF NURSE
	... I don't think I know that hospital.

		BETTY
	It's in a very pretty area that gets a
	lot of sun, has palm trees out front,
	mountains in the background...

		CHIEF NURSE
	Really?  You've just described all of
	Southern California.

The Chief Nurse looks at Betty for a moment, then stands
abruptly, signaling the end of the interview.

						   67.


		CHIEF NURSE
		(cont'd)
	Well, I'm sorry, but I can't even
	consider you without references or a
	resume.  And frankly, I don't know how
	you could have forgotten them.



85     INT. HOSPITAL / HALLWAY - LATER		       85

On her way down the hall Betty passes a patient's room when
the sound of A PERSON MOANING stops her.  She can't help but
go inside.  A TV plays commercials.

AN OLDER WOMAN lies in bed, alone and staring at the ceiling.
Betty looks around and notices several arrangements of
flowers on a deserted nightstand.  She brings them over to
the older woman's bedside, positions them, then gently
strokes her head.

		BETTY
	There... you rest now.

The woman's eyes flutter.  She is disoriented at first, then
calms as she adjusts to the comforting sight of Betty.  Betty
takes her hand.

		OLDER WOMAN
	Who... who're you?

		BETTY
	I'm... I'm Nurse Betty.

The woman smiles serenely at this and begins to drift off.
Betty checks her monitors as the opening credits of "A Reason
to Love" begin to play.

She glances up at the doorway at the same moment and sees Dr.
David Ravell standing at the entrance.  He checks the chart
on the door, smiles warmly at Betty and then moves off.  In a
flash, Betty is up and after him.

The THEME MUSIC is her private soundtrack as she checks out
every man in surgical scrubs, looking for David Ravell.
Then... She sees him.  In all his glory at the end of a
corridor walking away from her.  Betty gives chase.  She
gains steadily on him, her heart racing.  As they near
Emergency the NOISE LEVEL picks up.
He stops at the nurses' station.  Betty closes the gap.  She
starts to run.

		BETTY (CONT'D)
	DAVID!!!

						   68.


He turns to face her ... It's not David Ravell.

		BETTY (cont'd)
	Sorry, I thought you were someone else.
		(BEAT)
	Do you know Dr. David Ravell?

The man shakes his head.  Betty keeps going, looking around:
it's incredible - the size, the activity, the intensity.



86     INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY AREA - SAME TIME		  86

DOZENS OF PATIENTS lie on gurneys awaiting treatment in a
holding area.  It's still more intense at the entrance:
VOICES talking back and forth urgently, POLICE OFFICERS,
CIVILIANS, DOCTORS AND NURSES converging.



87     EXT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY AREA - LATE AFTERNOON	 87

FIVE AMBULANCES unload patients at the same time.  At that
moment a group of TWENTY JAPANESE HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATORS
reaches the E.R. portion of their tour.

A WHITE MERCEDES tears up the ramp and SCREECHES to a stop.
A YOUNG MAN in gang colors is pushed out, bleeding heavily.
A DOCTOR runs at the Mercedes to head it off, yelling
indignantly.  The car plows right into him and takes off.
Another ambulance crests the ramp, lights flashing.  The
Mercedes SLAMS into it head-on.  NURSES AND DOCTORS run into
the parking lot. A GANGBANGER gets out of the Mercedes, dazed
and wobbly.  He pulls a pistol.  Everyone dives for cover.

The Mercedes driver is unconscious. The driver of the smashed
up ambulance is slumped over the wheel.  The rear doors fly
open, and a young Hispanic woman, ROSA HERRERA, leaps out.

		ROSA
	SOMEBODY HELP US!  PLEASE, SOMEBODY!

Doctors and nurses work on patients and try to get to the
injured doctor, but the kid with the gun keeps them away.
SECURITY GUARDS draw their guns and scream at him to drop it.

		ROSA (cont'd)
	WHY ISN'T ANYBODY HELPING US?!!
		(to gunman in Spanish)
	Hey, you little shit!  If I had a gun I'd
	shoot you right now!

The loading area is jammed with panicked people.  Doctors and
nurses creep out of the hospital on all fours, trying to stay

Betty.  They look right at each other.

		ROSA (cont'd)
	What are you standing there for?!

Betty walks toward her calmly, indifferent to the danger as
Rosa pulls the gurney out of the ambulance herself.  A
PARAMEDIC lies unconscious inside.

		ROSA (cont'd)
	You gotta help him, he's hurt bad!!

On the gurney is a YOUNG MAN with a chest wound, nearly dead
from blood loss.  A DOCTOR appears and quickly examines him
while keeping one eye on the gunman.  He looks up at Betty.

		DOCTOR #1
	Forget it!  He doesn't have a chance.
	Help us over here.

The doctor takes off.  Rosa looks at Betty, crying.

		ROSA
	Please!

Betty hesitates, then checks his pulse - he has none.  She
peels back the bandages over a huge chest wound.

		ROSA (CONT'D)
	Danny, it's gonna be all right!

Betty looks at Rosa again; looks around for help - there's no
one.  She plunges her fingers into the wound.

		ROSA (cont'd)
		(panic)
	What are you doing?

		BETTY
	He has no heartbeat!

		ROSA
	You're hurting him!!

		BETTY
	I'm massaging his heart.  I saw it done
	once.

		ROSA
	ARE YOU CRAZY?!!  STOP IT!!!

		BETTY
	LISTEN TO ME!  IF I DON'T DO THIS, HE'S
	DEAD!

						   70.


She keeps working on him.  We hear a GUNSHOT, and the kid
with the pistol falls to the pavement.  The loading area
immediately fills with DOCTORS, NURSES and COPS.

		BETTY (CONT'D)
	All right, we're moving him inside!  Give
	me a hand!

Rosa is shocked into motion. Together they wheel Danny toward
the entrance.  A DOCTOR and TWO NURSES come out to take over.
Betty, her white uniform now covered in blood, steps aside.



88     INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - LATER		88

The DOCTOR tries to calm Rosa and keep her from entering the
treatment area.

		ROSA
	Is he gonna live?

		DOCTOR
	He's got a chance.  Thanks to what that
	nurse did.

They exit together as AN ADMINISTRATOR and several Japanese
officials approach.  The Chief Nurse hovers nearby.

		ADMINISTRATOR
		(to Chief Nurse)
	Harriet?  Who is that remarkable nurse?

		CHIEF NURSE
	That's Betty Sagamore.  I hired her
	today.



89     INT. CHEAP HOTEL - NIGHT				  89

SEVERAL LOW LIFES are hanging out in the lobby.  When Betty
comes in with a bag of groceries they look up, ready to
hassle her as she approaches the DESK CLERK.

		BETTY
	May I have my key, please?

She puts the bag on the counter, revealing that the front of
her white uniform is covered with blood.  She smiles at the
low lifes, stopping them in their tracks.



90     INT./EXT. MOTEL ROOM - HOUSTON, TEXAS - DAY		 90

The Town Car's looking a little muddy around the rims.
Charlie and Wesley look tired as they wait in a seedy motel

						   71.

room.  Charlie sits near a window, reading diary entries
aloud.  Wesley kicks back on the bed, fast-forwarding through
"Genghis Kunt" and talking back to the screen.

		WESLEY
	Thas' it, thas' it... conquer that bitch.
		(BEAT)
	What time're they coming?

		CHARLIE
	It's not an exact science, Wesley.  He
	said they'll be here... My Houston
	contact has always been very reliable.

		WESLEY
	And then we're gonna do her right here.
	Right?

		CHARLIE
	You're always so coarse... "Do her right
	here."  Let's just see what happens,
	okay?
		(reading)
	"I wish that I could find a way; To speak
	my thoughts on Mother's Day.  There are
	no words that quite express; My gratitude
	or happiness.  A pleasant smile perhaps a
	kiss; I would not fail to give her this.
	I'd make her glad the whole day through;
	By sayin' 'Mother', I love you!'  P.S. I
	wish I could say this to my mother's
	face, but I can't anymore."

Wesley rolls his eyes and turns up the volume.  Finally a car
pulls up outside and Charlie snaps the book closed.  He makes
a quick attempt to arrange himself and motions to Wesley, who
turns off the tape.

A WOMAN with greasy blonde hair and skinny legs shown off by
a short skirt comes in with another MAN.  Charlie looks her
over disgustedly as his face falls.

		CHARLIE (cont'd)
	Who are you?!
		(to the man)
	What the... Who the hell is this?

		MAN #1
	Easy, Charlie!  She's exactly who you
	said you were looking for.

		CHARLIE
	Wait, wait a minute.  We have a major
	miscommunication here.  This not Betty.
	This is not even close to Betty...

						   72.


		WOMAN
	What the fuck're you talking about?  My
	name's Betty...

		CHARLIE
	Then I'm sorry... Wrong Betty.

		WESLEY
	Let's get out of here.  We got another
	long drive ahead of us.
		(BEAT)
	... the fuck where I do not know, but I
	know it's gonna be long.

		CHARLIE
		(gathering his things)
	Betty would never dress like that.  She's
	not some trailer park slut!

		WOMAN
	Fuck you!

		CHARLIE
	And she doesn't have a sewer for a
	mouth...

		WESLEY
	Okay, thank you, goodbye... Keep in
	touch...

		CHARLIE
	... She's got class, and poise.  Lots of
	poise...

The man looks at Charlie, then at Wesley, who shrugs in reply
as he steers them out the door.

		WESLEY
	Will you ease off on the 'poise' shit,
	you're spooking me here...



91     INT. HOSPITAL - CHIEF NURSE'S OFFICE - DAY		  91

The Chief Nurse sits behind her desk.  Betty faces her like a
student in the principal's office, now dressed in her white
waitress uniform.  She hopes no one notices.

		CHIEF NURSE
	What you did yesterday was reckless at
	best.  You are not an employee of this
	hospital!  If that boy dies I don't even
	want to think of the lawsuit that'll
	follow.  Are we communicating here?

						   73.


		BETTY
	Yes, ma'am.

		CHIEF NURSE
	Good.  I'm prepared to offer you a job.
	You can help out in the pharmacy until
	your California certification and
	references arrive, but you are not to
	touch anyone.  Is that totally clear?
		(Betty nods)
	Fine...

The Chief Nurse gets up, and Betty follows suit.

		CHIEF NURSE
		(cont'd)
	You can start tomorrow.  And don't say a
	word about this to anyone.
		(studying Betty's uniform)
	Is that issue?

		BETTY
	Umm... yes.  Back home.

		CHIEF NURSE
	Alright.  Oh, and one more thing about
	what you did yesterday... Well done.



92     INT. HOSPITAL - INTENSIVE CARE UNIT - DAY		   92

Danny Herrera is in bed unconscious.  Rosa and her MOTHER are
keeping vigil when Betty enters. Rosa jumps to her feet.

		ROSA
	Hey, it's Supernurse!  Betty, right?

Rosa hugs her and tells her mother in Spanish who Betty is.

		ROSA (cont'd)
	My mother doesn't speak English.

Sra. Herrera smiles at Betty and starts to cry.  As she steps
forward, Rosa stands aside. The short, stocky woman envelops
Betty in a bearhug.

		MOTHER
	No podremos olvidar lo que hizo ayer.

		ROSA
		(translating)
	We can't forget what you did yesterday
	... How can my family ever repay you?

						   74.


		BETTY
	Tell her I was just--

		MOTHER
	Yo s que es su empleo, pero...

		ROSA
	She doesn't care if it was just your
	job...  Danny would be dead now but for
	you.

Sra. Herrera kisses Betty's hands and smiles through her
tears.  Then she motions to Rosa to take her place as she
goes to Danny's bedside. Betty picks up Danny's chart and
reads it.

		ROSA (cont'd)
	You don't sound like you're from here.

		BETTY
	I'm not.  I just drove in from Kansas.

		ROSA
	So why'd you come to L.A.?

		BETTY
	I came for love.  My fianc  is here.

		MOTHER
	Bravo! Mi hija no hace nada para amor...

		ROSA
	You're making me look bad... My mother
	says I wouldn't move across the street
	for love.

		BETTY
	It's something I had to do.  For David.

		ROSA
	'David.'  That's your guy.  So, you
	staying with him?

THE ICU NURSE enters and adjusts the bank of machines
feeding, medicating and monitoring Danny. Betty watches with
interest.

		BETTY
	No... I don't really know where he is
	yet.  I'm at a hotel around the corner.

		ROSA
	Man, that is love.

						   75.


		MOTHER
	Ella debe quedar contigo.

		ROSA
	What?  Ahh, Mom says you should stay with
	me... Okay, yeah, why not?

Betty looks at Sra. Herrera curiously.

		ROSA (CONT'D)
	You can go get your stuff right now. I'll
	walk you down.

		BETTY
	No, that's not, I couldn't...

		ROSA
	Listen, when someone does the kind of
	thing you did, you gotta do something in
	return.  So, you stay with me until you
	find your David and live happily ever
	after.  Okay?

Rosa follows Betty out the door.



93     EXT. ROSA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT			 93

Betty and Rosa make their way up the stairs of a Silverlake
apartment house.

At the sound of SCREECHING TIRES they both look down as a
black Lincoln Town Car drives by.  Betty shudders.

		ROSA
	You okay?  This neighborhood, you get
	used to it...

She nods. Rosa continues to talk as they climb the many
stairs that lead to her door.

		ROSA (cont'd)
	I got this apartment with a guy.

		BETTY
	The one you were telling me about?

		ROSA
	No, this one was worse...I had to have
	the place sprayed when he left.  Twice...
	He was two guys before the last one--not
	counting a little office thing in there,
	which I'm trusting you with, 'cause if it
	gets out, I'm on the street...

						   76.




94     INT. ROSA'S APARTMENT - SAME TIME		     94

The place is neat.  As well furnished as a legal assistant's
salary will allow.  The living room is dominated by a large
glass tank filled with tropical fish.  Betty checks out the
space.

		BETTY
	It's lovely...I really like your
	aquarium.

		ROSA
	Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your
	razor or pee on the seat...

		BETTY
	Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty
	tough go of it with men...

		ROSA
	Oh, I dunno...but just once I wish I'd
	run into a guy who noticed the Koi before
	my tits.

Betty smiles, a little embarrassed.

		ROSA (cont'd)
	...come on, I'll show you your room.



95     EXT. TEXAS HIGHWAY - THE NEXT DAY		     95

The black Lincoln Town Car is parked on a lonely stretch of
prairie highway.  Wesley sits in the passenger seat with the
door open. The RADIO is on. Charlie is on his cell phone
nearby.

		CHARLIE
		(into phone)
	No, we don't know where she is... I
	understand... No, we'll find her...
		(BEAT)
	I understand.

He hangs up and looks out at the horizon, where huge black
storm clouds are gathering.  Then he walks slowly to the hood
of the car, staring at the ground in front of his feet.

		WESLEY
	What'd they say?  Can we go back to
	Detroit?

Charlie rests his hands gently on the hood, as if considering
buying the car.  Wesley's MUSIC BANGS from the radio.

						   77.


		CHARLIE
	They said find it.  Find her, find it.
	Finish the job you were paid to do.

		WESLEY
	Half.

		CHARLIE
	What?

		WESLEY
	They paid us half.  They still owe us
	half...

		CHARLIE
		(disappointed)
	There it is again.  That lousy attitude
	that got us here in the first place.
	That "make a statement," do an end zone
	dance, shake your ass and sue everybody
	in sight attitude that's dragging this
	whole country down the drain.
		(BEAT)
	They don't owe us shit, Wesley!  WHEN YOU
	FINISH THE JOB, YOU GET PAID!!  WE
	HAVEN'T FINISHED THE GODDAMN JOB!!

Charlie POUNDS on the hood of the car, scaring Wesley.

		CHARLIE (cont'd)
	That woman could be in any one of four
	states.  Four big states where the deer
	and the antelope play, Wesley!  We're not
	in Rhode Island!

		WESLEY
	I know that.

		CHARLIE
	AND TURN THAT FUCKING MUSIC OFF!

Wesley switches it off.  Charlie turns his back to the car
and addresses the angry clouds on the horizon.

		CHARLIE (cont'd)
	Do I deserve this?  In the twilight of my
	career, do I deserve this?  I don't think
	so!  I've always tried to do what's
	right.  I never took out anybody who
	didn't have it coming.  I'm a
	professional!
		(BEAT)
	AND WHERE THE FUCK AM I?  I'M IN
	PURGATORY!

						   78.


		WESLEY
	Worse... you're in Texas.

		CHARLIE
	Well, I should be in FLORIDA now!  If
	Carl hadn't gone in to get those stones
	removed, you wouldn't be here and I'd be
	on my way to the Keys.  On my boat,
	RELAXING WITH A GLASS OF PORT!!  Re-ti
	red!

The first raindrops begin to fall.

		CHARLIE (cont'd)
	I'm very tired, Wesley!  I've worked
	hard, and the work should be over, but
	IT'S NOT!  This job is just beginning.
		(he turns around)
	GET IN THE CAR!

Wesley is in the car, but he's too scared to tell Charlie,
whose eyes are blazing.  Charlie silently walks around to the
driver's side and gets in.  He and Wesley stare at each other
over a photo of Betty, which is between them on the dash.
Charlie starts the engine and snatches up the picture.

		CHARLIE (cont'd)
	What're you thinking, girl?  What's going
	on in that pretty little mind of yours?
	Huh?  You can tell me...

He paws at the picture, imploringly.  He mutters to himself.
Wesley shakes his head and stares out.



96     INT. HOSPITAL - PHARMACY - DAY			96

Betty sits in an office along with a CLERK who taps away at a
computer keyboard while she studies a printed list of names.

		BETTY
	I can't find Loma Vista Hospital...

		CLERK
	I never heard of Loma Vista Hospital.

		BETTY
	I don't believe this!  You're the second
	person here who's told me that.  That's
	like Ford saying they never heard of GM!

		CLERK
	Try another county...

						   79.


He exits.



97     INT. LAW FIRM - LATER				     97

Rosa is on the phone at her desk in a law office.

		BETTY (V.O.)
	Hey, Rosa...it's Betty. How do you get to
	this town called 'Tustin?' It's in Orange
	County...

		ROSA
	Tustin?  Take the Hollywood Freeway to
	the Five...

		BETTY (V.O.)
	The Five?

		ROSA
	Just look for the really crowded road and
	follow that.

		BETTY (V.O.)
	Okay...oh, umm, would you mind if I
	borrowed some clothes?

		ROSA
	Huh?  Sure, look in my closet, take any
	dress you want!
		(BEAT)
	We're still on for tonight, right?



98     INT. EXAMINING ROOM - LATER			   98

Betty stands in a sexy pink dress, trying to decide if she
should put on a hospital gown and waits, tensing each time
she hears a voice from the hallway.  Finally, the DOORKNOB
BEGINS TO TURN.

A man's hand and the bottom of a white sleeve appear.  The
door swings open and a silver-haired, bespectacled DOCTOR in
his mid-60's enters.  The nametag on his white coat reads
"DAVID RAVELL, M.D."



99     INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT				    99

Tasteful jazz, plenty of red leather booths.  Betty winds her
way through a PACKED CROWD, passing out small white cards.
Rosa spots her and goes over to meet her.

						   80.


		ROSA
	You made it! Hey, that looks great on
	you.  'S classy... (BEAT) So, how'd it go
	today? You find him?

		BETTY
	Ummm...no, no. Different 'Ravell.'

Rosa starts to lead her to the bar.

		BETTY (cont'd)
	You know, the more I think about it, this
	really isn't David's kind of place.

		ROSA
	What are you talking about?  This bar is
	packed with professional people!
		(BEAT)
	Everybody says if you're going to get
	married, this is the spot to meet
	someone...  Luckily, I'm currently off
	men, so I've got the luxury of not giving
	a shit.

		BETTY
	I know what you mean, I recently had some
	trouble with a man, a different man...and
	David's still getting over Leslie.
		(off Rosa's look)
	His wife.

		ROSA
	He has a wife?!

		BETTY
	Had. She died in a car accident last
	year.  She was decapitated.

		ROSA
	God, that's awful!

		BETTY
	It may not have been an accident.  They
	never did find her head...

		ROSA
	Her 'head'?! You're making this up...

		BETTY
	No, no! Well, see, she was having an
	affair with a Russian diplomat who I
	believe was mixed up with the Mafia...

						   81.


		ROSA
	Jesus, I thought my love life was
	crazy...

LATER

Rosa and Betty are sitting in a booth, talking over drinks.
The place is a little quieter now.

		ROSA (cont'd)
	... so, we'll hit the library first and
	fan out from there.  They've got all the
	L.A. phone books, plus medical
	directories...
		(BEAT)
	We're not gonna let him hide from you any
	more, okay? I'm making this my personal
	mission.

		BETTY
	David isn't hiding from me, I left him
	standing at the altar six years ago and
	now I'm...

		ROSA
	Fuck the details, they're always to
	blame...  Look, too many of these guys
	duck out on us, especially after they
	become doctors or lawyers.  I see it at
	my company all day long!  So I'm just
	gonna make sure you get your, you know,
	fairy tale ending or whatever...
		(BEAT)
	One of us should.

		BETTY
	Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all
	this for me...thank you.

Rosa glances over to see Betty pass a business card to A
WAITER who checks on them.  When he is safely gone, Rosa
touches Betty on the sleeve.

		ROSA
	Hey, how 'bout a card for me?  What is
	that?
		(takes one, reads)
	"Please call if you have any information
	on David Ravell."  This is my phone
	number!  How many of these have you given
	out?

		BETTY
	How many men have I talked to?

						   82.


		ROSA
	Jesus!  They're all gonna be calling me!

		BETTY
	You said in L.A., anything goes.

		ROSA
	I was talking about what you could wear!



100     EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - THE NEXT DAY		   100

The Town Car's parked on a barren stretch of desert highway,
white smoke billowing from the hood.  Half a mile ahead
Charlie and Wesley are walking in the sweltering heat.

They're in their shirtsleeves, drenched in sweat as the sun
beats down on them.

		CHARLIE
	See, in a LeSabre Betty's probably
	getting twenty-two, maybe twenty-five
	miles to the gallon, where we're topping
	out at fifteen.
		(BEAT)
	She's probably all cool and fresh, and
	comfortable in that nice air-conditioned
	car right now.

Wesley wipes the sweat from his eyes and trudges on in
silence. Charlie takes out a photo of Betty and speaks to it.

		CHARLIE (cont'd)
	You don't look comfortable here.  That's
	'cause you don't like being the center of
	attention, do you?  Nah. You're like me.

		WESLEY
	What the hell's the matter with you?

Wesley grabs the photo, tears it in half and tosses it. Then
he starts walking. Charlie is stunned for a moment, but
recovers quickly. He finds the pieces and stuffs them in his
pocket, then catches up to Wesley.

		CHARLIE
	That was a really shitty thing to do.

		WESLEY
	I'm sick of looking at her mother-fucking
	face.

A beat... they walk for a moment.

						   83.


		CHARLIE
	Don't talk like that.  She's my last one,
	Wesley, my final target.
		(to photo)
	Don't you realize your special, that you
	represent something?

This is too much.  Wesley explodes.

		WESLEY
	What?  What does she represent?!  What
	could some cornbread white bitch from
	Kansas who's dragging our sorry asses up
	and down the Louisiana Purchase possibly
	mean to you?!!  I'd just love to know...

		CHARLIE
	I dunno... something.
		(BEAT)
	Why is she doing this to me?  Why?...

		WESLEY
	I don't know, but when we find her she's
	gonna die for it.



101-102	 MOVED				      101-102



102A     INT. ROADSIDE GARAGE - LATE AFTERNOON		     102A

The Lincoln Town Car is raised up high on the hydraulic jack.
Wesley is at a pay phone out front.

		WESLEY
	Can you describe her to me?... Okay...
	Yeah, that sounds like her... Thanks.

He hangs up and goes into the garage, where he addresses the
Town Car above him.

		WESLEY (cont'd)
	They found her in Vegas.

No answer.

		WESLEY (cont'd)
	Perfect match on the description.

ON CHARLIE

Lying across the front seat taping the reassembled photo of
Betty to the dash.  Charlie's beginning to come apart.  His
hair is uncombed and his clothes are wrinkled.  His eyes have
a thousand-yard stare.

						   84.


		WESLEY (O.S.)
		(CONT'D)
	Sounds like she's with the buyer Del
	lined up.

Charlie pulls himself up on the door and looks down.

		CHARLIE
	How'd they describe her?

		WESLEY
	You know, blonde, thin, whatever...

		CHARLIE
	Not so fast!  Slower... 'blonde, thin',
	yes... Did they say she had style?  A
	kind of grace or anything?

Wesley rolls his eyes, then goes straight to the levers
controlling the hydraulic jack.

		WESLEY
		(to mechanic)
	How do I get this fucking thing down?

		MECHANIC
	I wouldn't if I were you.  He got pretty
	upset when I tried it...



103     INT. LAW OFFICE - A DIFFERENT DAY		    103

MERCEDES LOPEZ, early 40's, impeccably dressed, enters her
office loaded down with a bulging briefcase and a stack of
files under her arms.
(The entire scene is in Spanish.)

		MERCEDES
	What do you think my father would do if I
	told him I didn't want to be a lawyer
	anymore?

		ROSA
	Probably the same thing my mom would do
	if I got engaged... have a heart attack.

		MERCEDES
	So how's it going with your new roomie?
	What's her name?

		ROSA
	Betty.  It's O.K. except I'm worn out.
	We spent all weekend looking for her

						   85.

	doctor-boy.  How can a big time heart guy
	leave no trace of himself?

		MERCEDES
	So tell her to settle for the old one in
	Orange County.

		ROSA
	She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of
	ideas.

		MERCEDES
	Maybe we're suing him for malpractice.
	What's his name again?

		ROSA
	David Ravell.

		MERCEDES
	God, that sounds so familiar.  Ravell,
	Ravell... where's he out of?

		ROSA
	I'm not sure now.  She said he used to be
	over at Loma Vista.  I never heard of it.

		MERCEDES
	Loma Vista?
		(laughs)
	You mean like the guy on "A Reason to
	Love?"



104     INT. ROSA'S APARTMENT - LATER			104

Rosa enters, tosses her purse on the table and goes straight
to the VCR.  Written in magic marker on a video is "A Reason
to Love, Apr. 23."  The tape Sue Ann gave to Betty.
She pops it in and turns it on. The OPENING TITLES start ...
The characters appear ... one is an impossibly handsome man
over the title "DOCTOR DAVID RAVELL."



105     INT. HOSPITAL PHARMACY - LATER STILL		 105

Betty working at a desk in the pharmacy.  The same clerk as
before busies himself at another counter.  Rosa appears at
the glass partition and raps urgently on it.

		ROSA
	Guess who I saw today.

		BETTY
	Who?

						   86.


		ROSA
	Doctor David Ravell.

		BETTY
	What?  Where was he?!

		ROSA
	ON TELEVISION!!
		(off Betty's puzzled look)
	Cut the shit, will you!

A BEAT.  Rosa SLAMS the videotape down on the counter.

		ROSA (CONT'D)
	Either you're making a fool out of me
	because you get off on it, or you got
	serious problems.  Which one is it?!

		BETTY
	I have no idea what you're talking about.

		ROSA
	I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!

		BETTY
	Shhh!  I heard you the first time.

		ROSA
		(suddenly calm)
	I spent my weekend looking for someone
	who does - not - exist.  I should have
	been here at the hospital with my
	brother, but I was with you.

		BETTY
	If you didn't want to do it, you should
	have said so!  Is this about gas money?

		ROSA
	IT'S NOT ABOUT GAS MONEY!!
		(BEAT)
	You have a thing for an actor on a stupid
	white soap opera, and we searched all
	over town for his character!  Not the
	actor - whose name is George, by the way.
	His character!

Rosa stands over Betty, fuming.

		BETTY
	Are you having a nervous breakdown?

Rosa SCREAMS and smacks her hand on the glass as Betty
watches.  SEVERAL PEOPLE in a nearby lounge look up.  Rosa
stares at them until they look away.

						   87.


		BETTY (cont'd)
	Why'd you help me in the first place?

		ROSA
	I helped you because I'm an idiot!  Ask
	my mother, I love it when people take
	advantage of me!  I TRUSTED YOU!! I
	THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!

		BETTY
	HE IS REAL!!

Betty tries to return to her work but Rosa confronts her
loudly.  The nearby VISITORS and STAFF pretend to be busy.

		ROSA
	You need help, Betty! Even if this is
	your idea of a joke, you need SERIOUS
	HELP!!
		(walking away - to herself)
	Necesitas un mdico! Pront simo!

ON BETTY

fuming in her humiliation.  After a moment, Rosa reappears at
the window.

		ROSA (cont'd)
	I'm not going back on our arrangement. My
	word is good, and my family owes you. But
	I think it's best for both of us if you
	get your own place as soon as you can.

		BETTY
	Fine.



106     OMIT (NOW 102A)				    106



106A     EXT. SIZEMORE MOTORS - KANSAS - NIGHT		     106A

Roy and Joyce approach the door to the trailer/office.  She
takes out her key, then stops. It's been padlocked and barred
with yellow police tape, as is the whole lot.  Roy pulls hard
on the lock, then starts looking around.

		JOYCE
	You're wastin' your time, Roy.

		ROY
	Look Joyce, I need your key to the files,
	not advice, okay?  This is a complex
	case.

						   88.


Roy works on opening a side window.

		JOYCE
	Nothin' complex about it. Del's dead,
	Betty's gone.  She's probably dead, too.

		ROY
	You'd like that wouldn't you?  You've
	hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad
	together...

		JOYCE
	No... before that.

		ROY
	Ahh, I hate this town!  Places like this
	just make you small...
		(BEAT)
	I should have never come back here after
	college.

		JOYCE
	Blah - blah - blah...  Hurry up, will ya,
	I got a date tonight...

Roy forces the glass open and starts to squirm through the
window as Joyce watches.

		JOYCE (cont'd)
	I don't know what you think you'll find,
	anyway.

		ROY (O.S.)
	Names, a phone number, something...
		(BEAT)
	Listen, Ballard told me that the guy who
	brought the missing car down from Detroit
	was murdered, but do you see him doing
	anything about it?  If Ballard wasn't
	such a stubborn ass, I wouldn't have to
	be breaking in here...

The color drains from Joyce's face.

		JOYCE
	What did you say?

		ROY (O.S.)
	The driver was killed. I think there's a
	connection--

		JOYCE
		(starting to cry)
	No, about... Are you talking about Duane
	Cooley?

						   89.


		ROY (O.S.)
	Yeah.  Why, you know him?

		JOYCE
		(crying)
	Know him?  We were gonna get married! He
	was gonna leave his wife for me!
	Fuck!!...

Joyce begins to sob at the side of the trailer as Roy
shimmies through the window frame.

Suddenly, Ballard is there, weapon cocked and placed roughly
into Roy's privates.  Joyce backs away.

		BALLARD
	I know you don't use them, but if you
	wanna keep 'em you'll back out of there
	slowly...



106B     INT. SQUADCAR - MOVING - NIGHT		      106B

Roy is in the rear of the car, handcuffed to the screen
dividing the front seat from the back. Ballard is driving.

		ROY
	Come on, Elden, think about it.  The
	driver, all them trunks standing open
	like that... something's going on here!

		BALLARD
	I know that...

		ROY
	Well, do something, then, damnit!

		BALLARD
	You watch your mouth when you're in a
	goddamn county vehicle... You don't think
	I see what's going on?  Del, now this
	Cooley fella, both of 'em mixed up with
	Joyce... 'S not no conspiracy, not some
	episode off the X-Files... 's just a
	crime of passion, plain and simple.
	Betty's on some kind'a pre-minstral
	rampage, that's what is going on here.

A moment of silence as they drive.

		ROY
	Oww... Did you have to make these things
	so tight?

						   90.


		BALLARD
	No, I didn't have to.

He grins at Roy in the rearview mirror.



107     INT. LAW FIRM - ANOTHER DAY			  107

Mercedes Lopez arrives at the office and stops at Rosa's
desk.

(The entire scene is in Spanish)

		MERCEDES
	Hey... Is Betty still trying to find that
	soap opera guy?

		ROSA
	Oh, yeah... Man, I'd love to find that
	actor just to see the look on her face,
	watch her bubble burst in mid-air.

Mercedes hands her two tickets to a benefit.

		MERCEDES
	Here's your needle... He's supposed to
	make an appearance here tonight.



108     INT. BETTY'S BEDROOM - LATER			 108

Betty's lying on her bed reading "Modern Nurse".  The L.A.
Times Classifieds are open on the bed.  Rosa looks in.

		BETTY
	Don't worry, I'm looking... just taking a
	tiny break.

		ROSA
	This is crazy.  I come home, you go to
	your room.  You go in the kitchen, I go
	to my room.  It's stupid.

Betty nods in agreement.

		ROSA (cont'd)
	So what do you say?  Can we be friends?

		BETTY
	...okay.

Rosa smiles and starts looking at the tickets in her hand.

		BETTY (cont'd)
	What are those for?

						   91.


		ROSA
	Oh, it's a charity dinner.  The money
	goes to a good cause, but I don't have
	anybody to go with...

		BETTY
	Umm...

Rosa exits for a moment, then reappears in the doorway.

		ROSA
	...you hungry at all?



109     INT. LINCOLN TOWN CAR - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON	109

The car is covered in dust and mud from the road. It's worse
inside: food wrappers, empty bottles, pieces of clothing,
filthy windows.  They've been living in it.

Wesley's driving now. Charlie's almost unrecognizable: a six
day beard, uncombed greasy hair, bloodshot eyes, rumpled
clothes and an exhausted, faraway look.  The photo of Betty
faces him, taped to the glove box.  He is reading from the
diary, which he clutches like the Bible.
They roar along a desert highway, passing a sign that says
"Grand Canyon, This Exit.  74 Miles."  Charlie looks up,
marking his place.

		CHARLIE
	We should go.

		WESLEY
	We don't have time to look at a hole in
	the ground.  We can make Vegas in four
	hours.  This one's got to be her.

		CHARLIE
	It's a very moving experience, trust me.

		WESLEY
	No.

		CHARLIE
	One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the
	World.

		WESLEY
	No... be dark before we get there.  You
	wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?

		CHARLIE
	What difference does it make?  She wasn't
	in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We

						   92.

	went to every goddamn place Del mentioned
	and no Betty.  So what the hell makes you
	think she's in Vegas?  You think she's
	waiting for us with tassles on her
	titties?  Vegas is too crass for Betty.

		WESLEY
	I said, 'No.'  N-O.

Charlie turns to a passage and reads aloud.

		CHARLIE
	"When I grow up I'm going to become a
	nurse or a veterinarian.  I always want
	to help people and value all life, be it
	animal, plant or mineral..."
		(to Wesley)
	Does that sound like a goddamn showgirl
	to you?

		WESLEY
	Do you hear yourself right now...?  Like
	a fucking madman...

Wesley drives on stoically.  The Exit comes and goes.

		CHARLIE
	Every American should see the Grand
	Canyon.  Are you an American?

		WESLEY
	Yes, I am and we're not going.  Act
	professional.

Charlie stares at him, hate rising from just below the
surface.  He draws a nickel-plated pistol and points it at
Wesley's head.  Wesley looks at it and keeps on driving.

Charlie knows this isn't the way to handle it.  He lowers the
pistol.

		CHARLIE
	If you don't take the next turn for the
	canyon, I'm blowing my goddamn brains all
	over this car.

He puts the pistol in his mouth and cocks it.  Wesley looks
over, not so sure this time.

LONG SHOT of the black Town Car as the turn signal comes on,
and it eases onto a lonely dirt road.  Their headlights pick
out a sign that says: "Grand Canyon Fire Trail.  Forestry
Personnel Only."

						   93.




110     EXT. BEVERLY HILTON - EVENING			110

Rosa and Betty approach the hotel entrance.  Ahead of them a
black Lincoln Town Car pulls up. Headlights glint on the
chrome, hitting Betty in the eye. She freezes, and Rosa bumps
into her.

		ROSA
	Sorry.

Betty stares at the car, unable to remember what it should
mean.  Then a MAN in a tuxedo gets out.  Betty moves on.



111     INT. BEVERLY HILTON - LOBBY - EVENING		111

A sign on an easel reads "Save the Children."  Betty and Rosa
present their tickets at the door to a ballroom.

Several times there is a stir near the entrance and a
scattering of flashbulbs.  Rosa scans the crowd.

		BETTY
	Looking for someone?

		ROSA
	You never know who you'll see.

Rosa keeps looking.  Finally, GEORGE McCORD - the actor who
plays DAVID RAVELL - enters.

He comes in with LYLA BRANCH, late 40's, and TWO OTHER MEN.
Several women approach George, some starry-eyed, for quick,
polite greetings.  He's doing his job of being a soap star.

Rosa waits for an opening, then puts her hands on Betty's
shoulders and points her at George.

		ROSA (cont'd)
	Look who's here!

Betty's jaw drops.  She freezes.

		ROSA (cont'd)
	What are you waiting for?   Talk to him!
	You came fifteen hundred miles for this.

Rosa prods her, then Betty makes her way unsteadily toward
George.  When she's a few feet away he looks up.

He can't help but notice her - she's beautiful.  She's also
looking right into his eyes.  The conversation stops as he
does a double take in Betty's direction.

						   94.


		GEORGE
	Do I know you from...?

His friends watch as George studies her face.

		 BETTY
	...of course you do.
		(hurt)
	You don't remember me?

		GEORGE
	I take it I should.  I'm sorry.

		BETTY
	We were engaged.

		LYLA
	Oh good, another one...

George's friends look at each other.  A few heads turn.

		GEORGE
	I beg your pardon?

		BETTY
	But I'm the one who's sorry.  Letting you
	go was the biggest mistake of my life.
		(to his friends)
	We were thirteen days away from getting
	married and ... I just got scared. It's a
	mistake I've had to live with for six
	years.  But it's behind me now...
		(to George)
	And I hope you can put it behind you.
	I've missed you... David.

George sighs with relief.  His friends smile.  The tension
evaporates.  They can handle a fanatical fan.

		GEORGE
	That's very kind of you.

		BETTY
	The day I left you I just drove and
	drove.  I drove all day and all that
	night, and I didn't go anywhere.  I just
	kept driving.  I stopped at a little
	country church, and the pastor let me in,
	and I sat--

		LYLA
	... in the very first pew, where we would
	have sat on our wedding day.

						   95.


Betty looks at her.  So does George.

		LYLA (cont'd)
	I can't believe I remembered that,
	although I suppose I should.  I wrote
	it...
		(to Betty)
	But that was seven years ago, and you're
	quoting it verbatim.  I'm flattered... I
	think.  Or frightened.   What's your
	name?

		BETTY
	Betty Sizemore.  What do you mean you
	wrote it?

		LYLA
	I'm Lyla Branch.  I'm the Producer.

They shake hands.  ACROSS THE ROOM Rosa watches expectantly.

		LYLA (cont'd)
	Alright, I admit it, you had me there.
	You're better than most of them,
	anyway...do you have a headshot?

		GEORGE
	No, wait...what happened next, Betty?

		LYLA
	Are you sure you want to encourage this?
		(BEAT)
	No, you're right, let's have some fun.
	So, what did happened next, "Betty"?

		BETTY
	Well, David moved out here and started
	his residency.  Then he met Leslie--

		LYLA
	No, no, no.  We know all that.  What
	happened with you?

		BETTY
	I married a car salesman.

The friends laugh.  Rosa watches, confused.  So is Betty.

		FRIEND #1
	You were dumped for a car salesman,
	George!

		BETTY
	Why are you calling him George?

						   96.


		FRIEND #2
	Yeah - David - tell us about this car
	salesman.

George likes the challenge. This party isn't so boring after
all.

		GEORGE
	Oh, you mean Fred.

		BETTY
	No, Del.

		GEORGE
	Right, Del.  Del was one hot salesman.
	Of cars.  He could talk anyone into
	anything.

		BETTY
	You knew Del?!

		GEORGE
	Honey, I didn't want to tell you at the
	time, but Del and I go way back.  We went
	to school together.  In fact, he saved my
	life.  Two more minutes in that icy water
	and I would have drowned.  But Del jumped
	in and grabbed me.  We fell out of touch
	eventually, but I still owe him one.

		BETTY
	He never told me anything about...that's
	unbelievable!

		LYLA
	Funny, that's just what I was thinking...

		GEORGE
	I can't tell you how much it hurts me to
	hear that you married him.

His friends snicker.  Rosa stares.  Betty is oblivious to
everything but George.

		BETTY
	I'm so sorry.  Life makes us do awful
	things sometimes.

She's ready to cry.  Which only inspires him all the more.

		GEORGE
	I tried to tell myself it was for the
	best, that there was a reason behind it.
	But... Del?

						   97.


		BETTY
	There was no plan!  I was just young and
	stupid and scared!

		GEORGE
	You never gave us a chance...

		BETTY
	I know that.  I can't tell you how many
	times I've said that to myself in those
	exact words.

Betty wipes her tears away as they flow freely now.  George
doesn't like seeing her cry; he tries to say something but
his friends interrupt.

		GEORGE
	Hey, don't... come on, I was just...
	you're not really crying, are you?...  I
	was just playing along...

		FRIEND #1
	Now, look what you've done, George.

		BETTY
	Why do they keep calling you George?

		GEORGE
	I don't know.  Why do you keep calling me
	George?

		LYLA
	Listen - David - It's getting late.

George hesitates; Lyla sees it.

		GEORGE
		(to Betty)
	Right, uhh...I feel terrible about this,
	we have a prior engagement at another
	party.
		(BEAT)
	But... I'd be honored if you'd come.

		LYLA
	Yeah, bring your friend along. I'm sure
	you got a lot of catching up to do...


Rosa watches, stunned, as Betty waves to her as she leaves
arm-in-arm with the man of her dreams.

						   98.




112     EXT. GRAND CANYON - NIGHT				112

The Town Car is parked near one of the viewing stops at the
rim.  Charlie stands in the darkness, but Wesley stays in the
car.

		CHARLIE
	You don't know what you're missing,
	asshole.

Charlie walks toward the canyon rim.  Suddenly, Betty appears
in the headlights standing at the rail - her back to Charlie -
with a bouquet of flowers.

ON WESLEY

Just as he closes his eyes to rest, the CAR PHONE RINGS.

		WESLEY
	Yeah?

		SUE ANN (V.O.)
	Mr. Campbell?

		WESLEY
	Huh?

		SUE ANN (V.O.)
	Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?

		WESLEY
		(recovering)
	Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.

		SUE ANN (V.O.)
	It's Sue Ann Rogers, Betty Sizemore's
	friend?  I heard from her.

ON CHARLIE

walking toward the rail.  As he nears her, they kiss.

Suddenly, REPEATED BLASTS from the car horn.

The image of Betty shudders, then blurs, then fades away
entirely.  Charlie rubs at his eyes tiredly, then slowly
trudges back toward the car.

Charlie returns and gets into the car.  Silence.  Wesley
stares at him.

		WESLEY
	... you have a good time?  You make a
	little wish?

						   99.


Silence from Charlie.

		WESLEY (cont'd)
	Well, guess what?  I found Betty... where
	she's been, anyway.

		CHARLIE
	Where?  Where is she?

		WESLEY
	I'm not telling.

		CHARLIE
	What?

		WESLEY
	I'm not telling 'til you straighten up.
	You been acting like fucking Jerry Lewis
	on me and this shit's gotta stop or you
	can forget about your Betty... I mean it.

A slow transformation comes over Charlie.

		CHARLIE
	Wesley, I'm fine... just tell me where
	she is.



113     EXT. BEVERLY HILTON - NIGHT			  113

George, Betty, Lyla and the two friends are waiting outside
the hotel for their cars.

		FRIEND #2
	I bought a car from Del, too. He sold me
	a lemon.

		LYLA
	Really?  I put a hundred and thirty
	thousand miles on mine.

		BETTY
	Huh. I had no idea our little lot was so
	popular...

		FRIEND #1
	I never bought a car from Del.  But I
	loved him.  In my own way.

		GEORGE
	I guess we all did. (to Betty) You know,
	I didn't marry Leslie because I loved
	her.  I married her to forget you...

						  100.


		BETTY
	Oh, David...I'm sorry I caused you that
	much pain.

A black jeep 4x4 pulls up and ERIC AUGUSTINO, the actor who
plays LONNIE, gets out.

		BETTY (cont'd)
	Oh my God!  What's Lonnie doing here?

		GEORGE
	You're late, Eric.

		ERIC
	I know.  Why are you guys leaving?

		LYLA
	We did our twenty minutes.

Before Eric can take another step Betty SLAPS him across the
face.  FLASHBULBS go off as PHOTOGRAPHERS capture the moment.

		BETTY
	You bastard!  How can you even show your
	face around here?  Do you think we're not
	onto you?

		ERIC
	Who the hell is this?

		GEORGE
	Sorry.  She thinks you're someone else.

George hustles Betty to his car as photographers continue to
shoot.

		BETTY
	I know exactly who you are!



114     EXT. CANYON RANCH BAR - NIGHT			114

The Lincoln Town Car rumbles into the dusty parking lot and
parks.

		CHARLIE
	This doesn't look like the kind of place
	Betty would go to.

		WESLEY
	Maybe she had to use the bathroom.  She
	pees, doesn't she?!...

Wesley tears the photo of Betty from the glove box.

						  101.


		CHARLIE
	Be careful with that!

Charlie takes it back and gingerly secures the tape.



115     INT. CANYON RANCH BAR - NIGHT			115

Merle is at the bar, drunk, the only customer on a slow
night.  Ellen drops two coasters in front of Charlie and
Wesley as they sit down.

		ELLEN
	What can I get you?

		WESLEY
	We're Federal Marshals, ma'am.

Ellen looks dubiously at their unshaven faces and rumpled
clothes.

		CHARLIE
	We're looking for this young lady.

He slides the photo of Betty across the bar. Ellen's gaze
drops to the picture for a second, and Charlie sees what he
was looking for - a flicker of recognition.  He allows
himself a satisfied grin.

Wesley shows Ellen his badge as Merle checks out the photo.

		ELLEN
	I haven't seen her.

		MERLE
	Sure you have!  That's ...

		ELLEN
	Shut up, Merle.

Charlie continues to grin at Ellen ...

		WESLEY
	Ma'am, if you've seen this woman--

		MERLE
	Betty!  That's her name - Betty.

Charlie takes the photo and puts it back in his pocket.

		ELLEN
	I never saw that woman before, and
	neither has Merle.  He drinks too much.
	And don't try to tell me you're cops.  I

						  102.

	was married to a cop for nine years, and
	you're not cops.  Now get out of here.

Wesley steps behind Merle, takes a handful of his hair and
SLAMS his head into the popcorn machine on the bar.  Merle
staggers away, stunned. Wesley removes the tin popcorn scoop
from a nearby hook.

Ellen reaches for something under the bar, but Charlie's
faster.  He pins her arm with one hand.

		CHARLIE
	You haven't been very forthcoming with
	us.

They watch Wesley follow Merle at a slow walk around the pool
table, CLOBBERING him over the head about every five steps
with the popcorn scoop.

Merle wobbles with every shot, but won't go down.  They begin
a torturous second lap around the table, punctuated by the
CLANG of the scoop against Merle's head.

		CHARLIE
	What's your name, dear?

		ELLEN
	Ellen.

		CHARLIE
	That's a nice name.

After one more CLANGING shot Merle staggers, then falls.
Wesley walks over to Charlie and Ellen, drawing his knife.

		WESLEY
	That's a really nice name...



116     INT. GEORGE'S RANGE ROVER - MOVING - LATER - NIGHT     116

George and Betty are alone.

		BETTY
	Lyla's very nice.

		GEORGE
	Yes, she is.

		BETTY
	She told me I was charming and
	relentless, and would go far in this
	town.  And she said that unlike the other
	charming, relentless people she knew, she
	liked me.

						  103.


		GEORGE
	She's a good person to know.
		(BEAT)
	So where did you study again?

		BETTY
	Carleton School of Nursing.  Two
	semesters, but Del made me give it up...

		GEORGE
	Alright, okay... I think you broke the
	record for staying in character about
	three hours ago.

		BETTY
	You told me that two hours ago.

He pulls up in front of Rosa's apartment and parks.

		BETTY (cont'd)
	I haven't been this happy since I was
	twelve years old.

		GEORGE
	What happened when you were twelve?

		BETTY
	For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance
	that I'd been saving to take my mother to
	Kansas City.  We got our nails done and
	had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the
	top of a building from where you can see
	the whole city.  It was the last outing
	we took together.  She died the following
	year.

		GEORGE
	Wow ... You just gave me goosebumps, you
	know that?  You make it all sound so
	real.  Great improv...

		BETTY
	I just want everything to be perfect
	between us.

		GEORGE
	I know. Listen, we need to take a time
	out here.  Can we talk seriously for a
	minute?

		BETTY
	Of course.

						  104.


		GEORGE
	At last!  I know how much you want this.
	You're gifted and extremely determined,
	but ... it's not up to me.

		BETTY
	I know. It's up to us.

Betty leans over and kisses George - so deeply that he's too
surprised to react. She pulls away abruptly and gets out.

		BETTY (cont'd)
	I love you, David.  And I want to see you
	tomorrow, and the next day, and the next
	day.

Still surprised, and now a little intrigued, he watches her
go inside.



117     INT. ROSA'S KITCHEN - NIGHT			  117

Betty comes in and pours a drink from the fridge. Rosa
appears in a nightshirt behind her, framed in the doorway.

		ROSA
	Were you with him this whole time?

		BETTY
	Oh, God!  You scared me!  Yes...

		ROSA
	You still in love?

Betty nods.

		ROSA
	Does he know you think he's real?

		BETTY
	He is real.

		ROSA
	Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about?

		BETTY
	Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out
	here, what we've both been doing, you
	know...

		ROSA
	No, I'm not sure I could begin to
	imagine... So, where'd you go?

						  105.


		BETTY
	To a party in the Hollywood Hills.

		ROSA
	Was it a huge place?  With a view of the
	whole world?

		BETTY
	Yes.  I'd never been in a place like that
	before.

		ROSA
	I have, lots of times.  My mother used to
	clean them.  I used to piss in their
	pools.

Rosa gets up and starts for her bedroom.  She stops.

		ROSA (cont'd)
	This isn't fair, you know.  Do you always
	get what you want?

		BETTY
	No, almost never.

		ROSA
	But, you're in love with someone who
	doesn't exist.  You come here, you meet
	this guy, who should laugh in your face,
	and instead you leave with him!
		(BEAT)
	Betty, you are one-of-a-kind...

Rosa goes into her bedroom and closes the door. Betty smiles
and nods, sipping at her drink as she retires to her room.



118     OMIT (NOW 120A)				    118



119     INT. POLICE STATION - JAIL CELL - THE NEXT DAY	 119

From his cell Roy Ostrey hears a door open, then the sound of
approaching footsteps.  It's Ballard.

		ROY
	Elden, let me out of here. Now! This is
	ridiculous, I need medical attention!

		BALLARD
	That's a nice name for what you need...

						  106.


		ROY
	Come on, I have to get this dressing
	off...it itches!  And what about my fish?
	Who is taking care of them?

Ballard doesn't say anything. He's very grim, subdued.  Roy
has never seen him like this.

		BALLARD
	Just shut up a second and listen... That,
	uh... that bar in Arizona?  Where you
	said Betty was?

		ROY
	What about it?

		BALLARD
	Any idea where it is?

		ROY
	Little place called "Williams," why?

		BALLARD
	I just got something off the wire. The
	woman who owns it was murdered last
	night.
		(BEAT)
	Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or
	nothing, but... what else do you know?

		ROY
	I know plenty.



120     EXT. LYLA'S HOUSE - DAY				  120

Palatial, spartan.  Lyla is sitting in the inner court of her
Lloyd Wright home with George at one knee.

		GEORGE
	She makes me stretch!  I got inside my
	character last night like I haven't done
	in six years on "Reason".  It was a
	totally rejuvenating experience.

		LYLA
	I know, George, I was there.  I'm not
	denying that she's good.

		GEORGE
	She's even taken a job as a nurse!
		(BEAT)
	David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.

						  107.


		LYLA
	We know that...

		GEORGE
	Can I have an evil twin?

		LYLA
	No, George, we've already done that with
	Lonnie.  The blind one last year,
	remember?

		GEORGE
	Oh, of course.  Who can forget the Emmy?
		(BEAT)
	Then let me bring Betty to the set and
	see what happens.

		LYLA
	I don't know, George...

		GEORGE
	I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do
	you say?

		LYLA
	I'll think about it.

		GEORGE
	It'll be like live television!  Let's
	live on the edge a little.  You and I can
	break the mold here!

		LYLA
	I said I'll think about it.

		GEORGE
	Fine, but promise me one thing.  If we
	use her, I want to direct those episodes.
	She's my discovery.

		LYLA
	Actually, she was my discovery... just
	like you.

		GEORGE
	Hmm?

		LYLA
	"Would you like ground pepper on that
	salad, Ms. Branch?"  Remember?

		GEORGE
	... yeah.

						  108.




120A     EXT. L.A. FREEWAY - NIGHT			   120A

The black Lincoln Town car hurdles along the 10 Freeway, a
revitalized Charlie back at the wheel.  Surrounded by
traffic, the lights of the city in the distance, the two men
push on toward their new destination.



121     EXT. HOLLYWOOD MOTEL - THE NEXT DAY		  121

The black Lincoln Town Car - now washed and gleaming - is
parked in front of a modest motel.



122     INT. HOLLYWOOD MOTEL / BATHROOM - DAY		122

Charlie looks like a new man - showered, clear-eyed and
energized - he's at the sink shaving as Wesley watches from
his seat on the edge of the bathtub.

		CHARLIE
	So you believed the bartender.  Why?

		WESLEY
	Well... I think I saw her soul.

		CHARLIE
	That's good.  You're learning.  But let
	me tell you why I know she was lying.
		(BEAT)
	First off, Betty would never fall for a
	soap star.  It's beneath her.

		WESLEY
	I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...

		CHARLIE
	No, no, Betty came here strictly for
	business, 'cause it's the biggest market
	for what she's selling.  I should have
	known it all along.  I'm kicking myself
	as I shave here.  So, first thing we...

		WESLEY
	Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't
	make sense.

		CHARLIE
	What doesn't?

		WESLEY
	You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends
	theory, you believe that dumbshit
	trucker, you believe this woman...

						  109.


		CHARLIE
	I never said that I believed...

		WESLEY
	No, you believed her, we drove all the
	way to L.A. so that means you trusted her
	that much... so why's the rest of her
	story suddenly so kooky?  Huh?

		CHARLIE
	'Cause I just don't buy it.  Call it
	instinct.  Call it 35 years of
	professional know-how...

		WESLEY
	I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat
	Almond Roca...

		CHARLIE
	You need to remember who you're talking
	to...

		WESLEY
	I need to get my goddamn head examined.
		(BEAT)
	You can't rule something out on a whim.
	Or because she's cute.  I've been
	following your whims all across the U.S.
	of A. and now I'm tired!  Me!

		CHARLIE
	Wesley...

		WESLEY
	"It's beneath her..."  She's a mother
	fucking housewife... nothing's beneath
	her!

Wesley stands up for emphasis, pointing a finger in Charlie's
personal space.  Charlie reacts at this, throwing his razor
into the sink and turning on Wesley.

		CHARLIE
	Boy, you need to get outta my face...
	now! You got a feeling, then you do what
	you gotta do, but don't you ever try to
	tell me my job.  Not ever.

It's a standoff.  Wesley blinks first.  He stalks off and out
of sight.  In a moment, he returns.

		WESLEY
	Fine.  Just fine... I'll go check some
	shit on my own then.  And don't call me
	'boy...'

						  110.


He turns and slams into the door frame.  He glares at
Charlie, then exits.  When the front door BANGS SHUT allows
himself to go back to his shaving.



123     EXT. STUDIO BUILDINGS - DAY			  123

Map in hand, Wesley stand near A GUARD and discreetly asks
questions.

		WESLEY
	... what kinda car's Jasmine drive?

		GUARD
	Ahh, Mercedes, I think.  Black.

		WESLEY
	Yeah?  The sport utility?

		GUARD
	Uh-huh.

		WESLEY
	Damn, that's sweet...
		(BEAT)
	She really that good-looking in person?

		GUARD
	Better.

		WESLEY
	Oh fuck...

Wesley looks around covertly, then produces a fifty.

		WESLEY (cont'd)
	Hey, can you sneak me on the lot?

		GUARD
	Sure.

Wesley smiles and wanders off, headed toward a series of
studio buildings in the distance.  The guard watches him go.

		GUARD (cont'd)
	... it's Sunday, I can sneak anybody on
	the lot.



124     INT. HOLLYWOOD MOTEL ROOM - DAY		      124

Charlie toys with matches from the Canyon Ranch Bar. Working
off a list of names and phone numbers from his Zaurus, he
makes calls from his room.

						  111.


		CHARLIE
	Betty Sizemore, she's got ten kilos...
	Blonde hair, a great figure... sort of a
	whole Doris Day thing going on.  That's
	what I said-- Doris Day.  You could see
	her working at the U.N., or something.
	'The U.N.'  "United Nations."  Forget
	it...
		(BEAT)
	Nobody like that?  You're sure?  Yeah,
	Detroit by way of Kansas... Alright, let
	me know if you hear anything, okay?

He hangs up.  Deletes another one off the list and looks out
the window.  Checks the now well-worn photo of Betty.  He's
starting to doubt himself.



125     INT. ROSA'S APARTMENT / BATHROOM - EVENING		 125

Rosa stands in the doorway as Betty, wearing one of Rosa's
hotter outfits, puts on her makeup.

		BETTY
	Are you sure I can borrow this?

		ROSA
	No, please.  Go ahead, it's your
	funeral...

		BETTY
	Rosa...

		ROSA
	Well, what if this guy's just playing
	with you?  What if he's lying about who
	he is?

		BETTY
	You should have a little faith in people.

		ROSA
	Does he ever talk about medicine?  His
	patients, the hospital?

		BETTY
	All the time.  It's always "Loma Vista"
	this, "Loma Vista" that.

The DOORBELL RINGS.  Rosa goes to the front door and looks
through the peephole, then opens the door. George McCord,
flowers in hand, gives his best leading man smile.

						  112.


		GEORGE
	You must be Rosa.  I've heard so much
	about you...  I'm George McCord.

		ROSA
	Not as much as I've heard about you.
	She's a very nice girl and you better not
	hurt her.

		GEORGE
	What?

Betty appears.

		BETTY
	Rosa, so you've met David?

		ROSA
	Sure did!  And a funny thing, Betty, he
	introduced himself to me as George!

		BETTY
	Oh, he does that.
		(hugging him)
	It's this silly game he plays.  Half the
	people who know him call him George.



126     EXT. ROSA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT			126

		GEORGE
	I don't think your friend likes me.

		BETTY
	She's a little jealous, I think.  And
	confused when it comes to men...
		(BEAT)
	So where are we going?

		GEORGE
	Well, first I thought Patina, and then
	the Ivy, but then I thought of somewhere
	a little more romantic.  Like my place.



127     INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - NIGHT			  127

Modern glass and steel structure in the hills.  Austere.
Betty and George sit on the sofa with the lights low and SOFT
MUSIC playing.

		GEORGE
	God, I haven't felt like this since I was
	with Stella Adler in New York.  You're
	so...real.

						  113.


He leans forward slowly to kiss her, but Betty pulls back.

		BETTY
	You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me.

		GEORGE
	Didn't I?

		BETTY
	No, I would have remembered that name.
	The only Stella I ever knew was a parrot.
		(BEAT)
	Was this before Leslie?  Before us?...

George takes her face in his hands and looks at her.

		GEORGE
	I've never met anyone like you, Betty.

		BETTY
	I know, that's why we were meant to be
	together...

		GEORGE
	No, I mean your dedication scares me...

		BETTY
	It's easy to be dedicated, when you care
	about something...

		GEORGE
	Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first
	started, but now... the hours, the
	repetition... it's not all glamour and
	mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've
	listened to my people and tried to make
	the crossover to nights earlier, I don't
	know...
		(BEAT)
	...I just hope it's not too late for me.
	God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so
	easy to get caught up in the whole ego
	cycle of this business and make it all
	about yourself. Stop, right? That's it,
	no more about me tonight, I promise...
	Let's talk about you...what do you think
	about me? I'm kidding... Seriously,
	Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...

		BETTY
	...but I love listening to you, so that's
	okay...

						  114.


		GEORGE
	Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're
	feeling...

		BETTY
	Well, I just feel that life'll be much
	sweeter for you now with me around.  I
	promise...

		GEORGE
	You know, I almost believe that... you're
	like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown
	into my life...
		(laughs)
	I said that to Leslie, once, at her
	funeral, remember?...

		BETTY
	I remember.  You said it to her, but it
	was meant for me, wasn't it?

		GEORGE
	Yes... maybe it was.

She kisses him deeply, then allows herself to fall back on
the sofa, pulling George down on top of her and kissing him
passionately.



128     INT. HOLLYWOOD MOTEL - THE NEXT DAY		  128

Wesley hands Charlie a newspaper folded open to the
Entertainment section, where there is a picture of Betty
slapping the actor Eric Augustino. George is in b.g.

		WESLEY
	...so I'm standing there, minding my own
	business on Hollywood Blvd., checking out
	Gladys Knight's star-thing there, I look
	up at this little souvenir shop dude,
	Chinese dude, reading a paper... and who
	do I see?
		(holding up paper)
	That's Lonnie.  He's the show's Main
	Prick.  And that is definitely Betty.
	Now, that ain't no coincidence...
		(BEAT)
	I found out where they shoot it, and
	where the dressing rooms are.

Charlie studies the photo, troubled by something.

		CHARLIE
	Who's this?

						  115.


		WESLEY
	A doctor on the show... why?

Charlie thinks about it, then reaches into his pocket and
takes out the photo of Betty with the cardboard David.  As he
compares the photos, Wesley peeks over his shoulder.

		WESLEY (cont'd)
	What in the...
		(simmering)
	What the hell is this?  You've been
	holding out on me.  All this fucking
	time!

		CHARLIE
	It just didn't fit her profile...

		WESLEY
	Fuck the profile!  That's the same guy!!

		CHARLIE
	She can't be here because of a... a soap
	opera.  Not a soap opera.  That'd make
	her...

		WESLEY
	... crazy!  No shit, Shaft!!  And you
	ain't far behind...

		CHARLIE
	... but she's, no, Betty's smarter than
	that.  She wouldn't be here for a...

		WESLEY
	I do not know how the fuck you lasted an
	hour in this job!  Dragging our asses
	around with the answer to our prayers in
	your motherfucking jacket... a picture of
	that cunt right next to the...

Charlie cuts Wesley short by grabbing his shirt and pulling
him close.

		CHARLIE
	Don't  Don't you talk about Betty like
	that.  I don't care who she ends up
	being, you never use that word again.
	Got it?

		WESLEY
	Man, you have got to get some therapy.

		CHARLIE
	I said 'got it?'

						  116.


		WESLEY
	... yeah, I got it.
		(struggling)
	Come on, you're stretching out my vest...

		CHARLIE
	You made your point...
		(drops him)
	I was wrong.

He carefully folds the paper, pockets the photo and
straightens his clothing.  He straps on his holster and
checks his weapon for emphasis.

		CHARLIE (cont'd)
	Now, get yourself ready.



129     INT. MOTEL BATHROOM - DAY				129

Wesley gathering his gear through the open door.  Charlie
stands looking at himself in the mirror.  Touches at the gray
in his hair.  As an afterthought, he tosses on a splash of
cologne.



130     OMIT						 130



131     INT. SOUNDSTAGE - DAY				    131

George leads Betty past several standing sets and into the
'operating room' as CREW MEMBERS buzz around. Betty walks
with her eyes closed and holding George's hand.

		GEORGE
	Just a little further... come on...

George stops and puts both hands over Betty's eyes. He looks
about expectantly and then uncovers them with a flourish.

		GEORGE (cont'd)
	Surprise!

Betty stares, slowly trying to take in her new surroundings.
It looks like Loma Vista, but something is different.  Odd.
Cameras, lights, etc. - all the apparatus of a TV show - are
in plain sight... And very disorienting.

		BETTY
	Oh my gosh...I didn't know I was going to
	meet your friends today...I dressed a
	little casual.

						  117.


He leads her to a taped mark on the floor as CAST MEMBERS
appear, including JASMINE and BLAKE DANIELS.

		GEORGE
	That's cute...listen, you got the part,
	and I'm directing.  You've only got four
	lines today, so I thought I'd just spring
	it on you.  No blocking or anything, just
	stand near the nurse's station... we're
	gonna do a quick walk-through.  Alright?

He kisses her cheek and walks off toward the waiting Lyla
before she can respond.

		VOICE (O.S.)
	Quiet on the set!

		GEORGE
	Traffic was terrible...

		LYLA
	No, that's fine, we've only got seventy
	pages to shoot...take your time.

A STAGE MANAGER hands Betty a set of sides and an on-set
COSTUMER tries to fit her.

		BETTY
	Excuse me.  What are you doing?

		STAGE MANAGER
	We'll get you into hair and make-up after
	this, just put this on...

The other actors take their positions.  Lyla watches from
behind the cameras as David readies himself. Chloe enters the
set with Kleenex tucked into the neck of her costume.

		CHLOE
		(to Betty)
	Hi.  I hear you're great.  Good luck...

		BETTY
	What are you doing here?  David...

		GEORGE
	Your lines'll are in the script, but you
	can ad lib.

		BETTY
	Ad lib?

						  118.


		GEORGE
	In fact, I want you to ad lib, that's the
	magic I'm after.  I wanna give a whole
	new feel to the show.

She's sliding toward a complete meltdown.

		VOICE
	Slate it!

George steps back behind the cameras.  Betty's still frozen
to her spot, overwhelmed.

		GEORGE
	Just do what you've been doing.  Watch
	the scene and on your cue take off from
	there.

		VOICE
	5-4-3-2...

Chloe and Blake run through their lines lifelessly, then stop
when they get to Betty's cue. Their faces loom around her
menacingly.  Staring.  The lights are impossibly bright.
People begin to shuffle and stare at one another. Lyla clears
her throat as George bounds on stage, still smiling.

		GEORGE
	Betty?

		CHLOE
	Are you all right?

		BLAKE
		(to Chloe)
	I think you stepped on my first line...

		CHLOE
	... I was talking to her.
		(to Betty)
	Do you need anything...?

She's freezing up.  George approaches her.

		GEORGE
	Betty, I thought this would be the best
	way.  You know, throw you into it...

		LYLA
	What the hell's going on?

		GEORGE
	If you need a minute, that's okay. But I
	thought you'd want to--

						  119.


		BETTY
	David, I don't...  Can we talk privately
	for a second?

		GEORGE
	Stop calling me David.  We're on set, for
	Christ's sake, you don't have to call me
	David here.

As he pulls away Betty grabs his arm.

		BETTY
	Why are you doing this to me?

		GEORGE
	Why am I doing this to you?  Isn't this
	what you wanted?

Lyla approaches.

		LYLA
	Is there a problem, George?

		GEORGE
	No!  No problem, there is no...
		(to Betty, sotto)
	What is the problem?  Just do that...
	thing... you do!  Come on!  You drove me
	nuts with this for three days, now do it!

George steps back behind the cameras as if nothing's wrong.
Betty still hasn't moved.  She's shaking with fear.  The cast
and crew members find it hard to look at her.

		LYLA
	All right, everybody!  That's ten
	minutes!

		GEORGE
	No!  Let me try this!

		JASMINE
		(storming off)
	This is bullshit!

		LYLA
	Forget it, George.  It was a gamble, it
	didn't work.  Nice try.

		GEORGE
	Let me try this, goddamnit!  SHE'S BEEN
	DOING IT ALL WEEK, SHE CAN DO IT NOW!

		LYLA
	I SAID FORGET IT!

						  120.


George throws down his script and rushes up to Betty, who
reaches out to him.  He brushes her hands away.

		GEORGE
	Well, I don't know what you had in mind,
	but I hope you're happy.  I put myself on
	the line for you, my reputation, and
	you're making me look like an idiot.

		BETTY
	What do you mean?  What did I do to
	you...

		GEORGE
	Who put you up to this?  Did my ex-wife
	ask you to...?

		BETTY
	David, please--

		GEORGE
	STOP CALLING ME THAT!  MY NAME IS NOT
	DAVID, AND IF YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW THE
	DIFFERENCE, YOU'RE MORE FUCKED UP THAN I
	THOUGHT YOU WERE!

Betty begins to cry.

		STAGEHAND
	Leave her alone, George!

		GEORGE
	SHUT THE FUCK UP!! You're a fucking grip,
	go grip something!!!
		(to Betty)
	And you're not an actress, you're nothing
	but a soap opera groupie, aren't you?
	YOU HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO DO!  DO YOU??
	Well, why don't you get a fucking life,
	and stop ruining mine!

Betty stands dead still as George continues to berate her.
ALL SOUND slowly starts to drop out, then comes back abruptly
with a RUSH.  Suddenly a light snaps on for her and she
stares at him.

		BETTY
	I'm sorry...Oh my gosh, are you George
	McCord?!

		GEORGE
	...What?  What did you call me?

						  121.


		BETTY
	George...McCord. You're my favorite actor
	on...

		LYLA
	She called you 'George,' George.

		BETTY
	...did I win some contest?

		GEORGE
	But I'm David... I mean, I'm not David,
	but she thinks I am!  You heard her...
		(looking around the group)
	Stop staring at me... I'm not crazy, she
	is!

		BETTY
	Why are you screaming at me?  I mean,
	what am I... why am I here?  I don't...

		GEORGE
	You're doing this now?  After all the..
	are you sick?  Are you going to kill me
	now?

		BETTY
	No, I... I'll leave.  Forgive me if I
	caused you all any trouble... I just, I
	don't know how I...
		(to George)
	... I'm sorry.

George watches Betty walk off the set.  The cast and crew try
to pretend this scene didn't happen, except for Lyla, who
burns a hole into George's back.  Their eyes meet.

		GEORGE
	What?!



132     OMIT						 132



133     INT. TV STUDIOS / RECEPTION AREA - DAY		     133

George McCord, wearing sunglasses and still angry, strides
into the lobby.  Charlie and Wesley stand quickly and take
out their badges as he approaches.

		GEORGE
	What can I do for you, gentlemen?

						  122.


		CHARLIE
	How do you do, Mr. McCord.  We're trying
	to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a
	Ms. Betty...

		GEORGE
	Deranged.  That would be the right word.

Wesley takes out the photo of Betty.

		GEORGE (cont'd)
	That won't be necessary.  She's staying
	with a Rosa something... Hernandez,
	Herrera.  I know it's an 'H' sound... in
	Silverlake.

		CHARLIE
	Thanks so much.  You must get bothered by
	this kind of thing a lot.

		GEORGE
	More than you know.  Is there anything
	else?

		CHARLIE
	No, that should be more than--

		GEORGE
	Good.

George turns to leave.

		WESLEY
	Actually, there is one more thing.

George stops.  Wesley is suddenly shy, hesitant.

		WESLEY (cont'd)
	It's just... well... I watch the show
	too, and you being Dr. Ravell and all, I
	thought you could maybe get Jasmine to
	come out here.

		GEORGE
	You thought wrong.

George pulls away.  Wesley grabs his sleeve.

		WESLEY
	It's just for an autograph.  It's not for
	me...

		GEORGE
	It never is.

						  123.


George wrenches free of Wesley's grip and takes off.

Wesley is furious.  He catches George in two strides, spins
him around and SLAPS him across the face.  George's glasses
go skittering across the floor.  PEOPLE stare.

		WESLEY
	You need to learn some manners, friend...
	reach out to your goddamn fan base a
	little more.

Charlie pulls Wesley away.  George is frozen to the spot,
humiliated, a pink handprint emerging on his cheek.

		WESLEY (cont'd)
	... and I saw your movie-of-the-week.  It
	sucked dick!



134     EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - DAY			   134

Betty walks aimlessly along a busy street.  She moves without
direction, in a daze until a glint of bright light hits her,
causing her to turn.  She is staring at a black Lincoln
sitting in a car lot, sunlight dancing off its chrome.  She
shudders involuntarily at it.  Suddenly, she hears a familiar
voice.

		DEL (O.S.)
	What the hell are you doing here?

It's Del.  He's in a pastel version of his usual shirt,
slacks, and tie.

		DEL (cont'd)
	Well, are you gonna answer me?  What'd
	you come here for?

		BETTY
	I came for love...

		DEL
	You're not on that soap opera thing
	again, are you?  'Cause you know what
	that is?

		BETTY
	It's people with no lives watching other
	people's fake lives.

		DEL
	That's right.  So, if you know it, why
	are you in trouble?

						  124.


		BETTY
	I don't know.

		DEL
	You sure don't.  Who do you think you are
	coming to Hollywood, anyway?  You should
	remember where you came from. And who you
	really are.

Del looks up at the sun for a moment, shading his eye from
it.

		DEL (cont'd)
	I gotta run.  Got some serious clients to
	meet, with real potential.
		(BEAT)
	Goddamn, it's hot!

He wipes the sweat from his brow.  Betty looks at his
handkerchief and sees that it's soaked in blood.  Then back
at his face, now obscured by blood pouring down from his
head.
She stares, horrified, and in that moment Del becomes... a
MAN, staring back at her as he wipes the sweat from his brow.

		MAN
	Who are you talking to?  Are you crazy?

Betty backs away and melts into the flow of PEDESTRIANS.



135     INT. ROSA'S APARTMENT - LATER			135

Rosa comes home from work and tosses her purse and jacket on
the chair.  No Betty in her room.

		ROSA
	Bet-ty!?  Did the pizza guy show up yet?

She emerges from Rosa's bedroom with toiletries and moves to
an open suitcase in her room.  She barely acknowledges Rosa.

		ROSA (cont'd)
	Are you all right?
		(no answer)
	What happened?
		(BEAT)
	He dumped you, didn't he?  I KNEW IT WHEN
	I MET HIM!!  He's a loser, like the rest
	of them.  Mother-fucker!

Rosa now notices Betty packing.

						  125.


		ROSA (cont'd)
	What are you doing?

		BETTY
	I'm going back to... I need to... I don't
	know.

Rosa tries to stop Betty for a moment to talk.  Betty grabs a
pile of Rosa's clothes and heads for her room.

		BETTY (cont'd)
	... this is your sweater, right?

		ROSA
	Where are you going?

		BETTY
	I have to leave now.

She tries to put Betty's suitcase away.

		ROSA
	What?  No, I'm not gonna let you just run
	out of here... You need to talk about
	what's going on...

		BETTY
	You think I'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't
	know the half of it.  My husband was,
	ahh...

		ROSA
	Your husband?!

		BETTY
	Yes, I had a husband and he was killed
	two weeks ago in my kitchen.  I was right
	there...

Rosa stops.

		ROSA
	Jesus!... What are you saying?

They stare at each other for a beat.

		ROSA (cont'd)
	What?!  That you had something to do with
	it?

		BETTY
	I don't know.  I'm just starting to
	remember it now.  I don't...

						  126.


		ROSA
	Yeah, but your running away isn't going
	to help you with all this...

		BETTY
	There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw
	it, I think I watched the whole thing
	happen... Oh my God...

		ROSA
	Okay, okay, look, ummm... Let's just talk
	a little first and you'll feel better, I
	promise.

The doorbell rings.

		ROSA (cont'd)
	That's our pizza...  You can't go yet.



136     EXT. ROSA'S APARTMENT - DAY			  136

Charlie watches Betty undress from a nearby fire escape.  He
stares at the object of his desperate search with relief and
some fascination.

Betty's movements are unhurried, mindless.  Charlie stares,
mesmerized, until she steps into the shower.



137     EXT. ROSA'S APARTMENT - STREET - SAME TIME		 137

Wesley gently nudges open the trunk to Betty's LeSabre. The
cardboard cut-out of David Ravell pops out at him.

		WESLEY
	Whoa!  What the fuck're you doing here?

He breaks it over his knee and throws it in the gutter, then
quickly removes the wing nut holding the spare tire.  He
removes the tire, then raises the panel on the floor of the
trunk as Charlie joins him.

		WESLEY (cont'd)
	It's all here.  It hasn't been touched.

The bottom of the trunk is lined with brown paper-wrapped
bricks of cocaine.  Charlie stares at it, shaking his head.

		WESLEY (cont'd)
	You were right.  Del wasn't lying.

		CHARLIE
	Well, you were right about what that
	bartender said.

						  127.


Wesley looks at him.  He appreciates the compliment.

		WESLEY
	But you were right first.  You gotta
	follow your instincts.

Charlie takes a long look at Wesley and smiles proudly.

		CHARLIE
	What do your instincts tell you to do
	now, kid?

		WESLEY
	Leave.  Take this shit back to Detroit
	and get the rest of our money.

		CHARLIE
	We could do that.  I could be on my way
	to Florida, and you could go to Thailand
	and fuck your brains out.

		WESLEY
	...but that's not what we're gonna do, is
	it?

		CHARLIE
	No... if we don't finish this job, how
	are we gonna look at ourselves in the
	mirror?  This is it for me, Wesley, she's
	the last one.  My instinct says I gotta
	see this through with her, and if there's
	one thing I've tried to teach you here--

		WESLEY
	It's to follow my instincts.  And my
	instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge.

		CHARLIE
	No, I said to follow 'my' instincts.
	Now, we go up there and conclude our
	business.  Case closed.

Charlie walks off.  Wesley closes the trunk up and prepares
to follow him.

		WESLEY
	... oh, that's fucking democratic.



138     INT. ROSA'S APARTMENT / HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER	138

At the sound of the BUZZER Rosa goes to the door.  She looks
through the peephole and sees Charlie holding up a badge.

						  128.


		CHARLIE
	I'm Detective Jefferson--

		ROSA
	Oh... Did Betty call you?

Charlie nods.  Rosa opens the door, and he enters with
Wesley.

		ROSA
	She's got problems, but she's no killer.
	I hope you guys can straighten this
	out...

Charlie and Wesley exchange a puzzled look.

		CHARLIE
	We'll do what we can.  Where is she?

		ROSA
	Bet-ty!
		(to the men)
	Please, go easy on her.  She's had a
	really rough day.

Betty appears. She recognizes the men instantly and freezes.
Charlie's eyes wander over her... slowly.   Wesley notices.

		ROSA (cont'd)
	These guys are here to help you, Betty.

		BETTY
	I don't think so.
		(BEAT)
	Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did.

Wesley produces a pistol, sitting Rosa forcibly on the sofa
and tapes her mouth and hands.  Charlie walks over to Betty.

		CHARLIE
	We meet again.

He moves closer to her... almost whispers.  Wesley steps in
and quickly tapes her hands.  Charlie stops him.

		CHARLIE (cont'd)
	Not her mouth...
		(to Betty)
	I've spent many long hours in a car with
	your face staring back at me.  I've seen
	it painted on the horizon.

		WESLEY
		(to Charlie)
	What's wrong with you?

						  129.


A KNOCK at the door ruins Charlie's moment.

		ROSA
	That's our pizza.

Wesley hustles Rosa out of the room.

		CHARLIE
	Get rid of them.  You understand?

Betty nods, scared, and looks through the peephole.  She
stares with disbelief at ROY OSTREY.  He KNOCKS again. She
opens the door a crack.

		ROY
	Betty!  Boy, am I glad to see you!

		BETTY
	Roy!  What are you doing here?

		ROY
	You're in serious danger!

		BETTY
	Ahh, look, right now's not very...

		ROY
	I woulda' been here sooner, but Ballard
	put me in jail.  He still thinks you had
	Del scalped.

		BALLARD
	I never said that!  Open the door, Betty.

BALLARD shoves Roy aside; Charlie's getting edgy ...

		BETTY
	Sheriff, I don't...

		BALLARD
	C'mon, Betty, open up! I got some
	questions for you about...

		ROY
	Have you checked the trunk of that car
	you're driving, Betty?  I think there
	might be...

		BETTY
	It's not really a good time, guys...

		BALLARD
	Don't give me that.  I've come two
	thousand miles for this!

						  130.


Charlie has been listening quietly on the other side of the
door and finally snaps.

		CHARLIE
	Two thousand miles?  That's nothing!

He flings the door open, sticks a pistol in Ballard's face
and yanks them both inside.

		CHARLIE (cont'd)
	Hah!  You probably flew!  I've crossed
	the river Styx looking for her, pal!  I
	travelled the fucking country to be here!

Charlie slams the door and frisks them, taking a gun and
handcuffs from Ballard.  Wesley returns with Rosa.

		CHARLIE (cont'd)
		(to Betty)
	Who are these idiots?

		BETTY
	This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter.  And
	this is Sheriff Ballard.  We all went to
	Fair Oaks High together...

		CHARLIE
	Oh, this is wonderful...

Wesley takes over.  He sits Rosa down on the sofa, then
pushes Betty down next to her and beckons to Roy.

		WESLEY
	Come here.

He breaks Roy's nose with his pistol. Roy crumples to the
floor, holding his face. Betty starts to scream, but Charlie
puts his hand over her mouth.

Wesley tapes Roy's hands together, then beckons to Ballard.

		WESLEY (cont'd)
	Your turn.

Ballard drops to his knees in a prayer-like position near the
aquarium.

		BALLARD
	I got two kids and a dog...

Wesley grabs his shirtfront and slams him to the floor, then
with a foot on his neck, he loops Ballard's arms around one
leg of the steel aquarium stand and handcuffs him.

						  131.


Charlie does nothing but stare at Betty, his eyes locked with
hers.  Wesley sees it.

		WESLEY
	Act professional, remember?

Charlie pulls her to her feet.

		WESLEY (cont'd)
	What are you doing?

Charlie leads Betty out of the room.

		WESLEY (cont'd)
	No way!  This is not professional!



139     INT. BEDROOM - SAME TIME				 139

Silence.  Then Charlie takes out a knife and cuts the tape
from Betty's wrists, touching her hair.  Gently.  He leaves
her standing in the corner while he sits on the edge of the
bed.

		BETTY
	... I s'pose you did that so I could take
	my sweater off or something.

		CHARLIE
	No, just stand there... lemme look at you
	a minute.

She does.  Charlie stares intently at her.

		CHARLIE (cont'd)
	Do you know who I am?

		BETTY
	... I... I know what you are.

		CHARLIE
	Do you know why I'm here?

		BETTY
	I've got a pretty good idea. You're here
	to kill me, so kill me.  You want me to
	be afraid, but I'm not.  I don't care who
	you are, or why you two killed my
	husband...

Charlie studies her, then sets his gun down on the bed.

		CHARLIE
	You really... didn't have anything to do
	with what Del was doing, did you?

						  132.


		BETTY
	I have no idea what he was mixed up in...
	it was always something.

		CHARLIE
	So you weren't involved with him in his
	pathetic attempt to diversify?
		(off her blank look)
	Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?

		BETTY
	Drugs?  God, no!  I'm totally against
	drugs.

		CHARLIE
	Damn, life is strange.  I had you figured
	for this cold-blooded, calculating bitch--
	Not that I didn't admire you for it.

Charlie slowly folds his knife and pockets it.

		BETTY
	... well, if you're not going to slit my
	throat, why'd you come up here?

		CHARLIE
	... to see you.



140     INT. ROSA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME	140

Wesley stands over Ballard, about to tape his mouth. Rosa and
Roy are sitting in chairs opposite them, their mouths and
wrists already taped.

		BALLARD
	You killed that bartender in Arizona and
	the trucker in Texas, didn't you?

		WESLEY
	How did you find Betty?

		BALLARD
	I just put it all together. I knew David,
	Lonnie and Chloe were from that show.

Roy starts freaking out, trying to talk through the tape.

		BALLARD (cont'd)
	Betty thinks they're real people.  It
	sounded crazy, but it was worth a shot.

Roy is apoplectic...

						  133.


		WESLEY
	What do you want?!

Wesley tears his tape off.

		ROY
	That's a lie!  I figured it out!  I've
	been trying to tell this dumbass--

		BALLARD
	Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!

		ROY
	--small-time, pissant, Barney Fife--

		WESLEY
	SHUT UP!  Shut the fuck up, both of you,
	before I kill you!

		ROY
	I'm the one who watched the show...I
	was...

		WESLEY
	Did Chloe crack?

		ROY
	Totally.  She came apart like a house of
	cards.  They dropped the charges...

		WESLEY
	Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?

		ROY
	She's a lesbian.

Wesley immediately pulls his gun and points it at Roy's head.

		WESLEY
	You lie, motherfucker...

		ROY
	I swear to God!

Rosa STAMPS her feet, drawing Wesley's attention.  She tries
to talk through the duct tape; gestures for him to come to
her.

		WESLEY
	 What?!  You scream, you die.

He yanks the tape off.  Rosa winces.

		ROSA
	I have a tape of today's show.

						  134.




141     INT. ROSA'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - SAME TIME		141

Betty is sitting on the bed.  Charlie leans against the wall,
facing her.  He has trouble starting this.

		CHARLIE
	... I never meet people like you.  I'm a
	garbageman of the human conditon. I deal
	with trash, mostly, people willing to
	trade any part of themselves for a few
	more minutes of their rotten lives.  But
	you... you're different.

		BETTY
	I am?

		CHARLIE
	Sure. You could probably have any thing
	you wanted... somebody as beautiful and
	stylish as yourself, and you don't even
	realize it.

Betty looks curiously over at Charlie.

		CHARLIE (cont'd)
	I'm appreciably older than you, but my
	health is good.  I take care of myself,
	and I got some money socked away.  You'd
	never have to work agin, that's for sure.
	I'd treat you like a queen.

		BETTY
	Umm, I don't think that...

		CHARLIE
	Wait.  Let me get this out.
		(clears his throat)
	I like the symphony, walks in the rain,
	sunsets, animals and children.  I read
	passionately, and I like to discuss
	things.  I'm basically conservative, but
	flexible.  I've been involved in the
	death of thirty-two people, but I can
	live with that because the world is
	lighter by thirty-two pieces of shit,
	excuse my language.

		BETTY
	"Thirty-two?"

		CHARLIE
	Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting
	Del, on account of you... so, what do you
	think?

						  135.

		(BEAT)
	You probably feel I'm flattering myself
	to see us together.

		BETTY
	I don't feel that, no. I just....I'm not
	really who you think I am.

		CHARLIE
	No one is, honey.  Here, listen to
	this...  "If who I am and who I hope to
	be should meet one day, I know they will
	be friends."  Now that's beautiful.

Betty is stunned.

		BETTY
	I wrote that when I was twelve... where'd
	you get that?!

		CHARLIE
		(he pulls out the diary)
	I know.  I borrowed it from your
	grandparents because I... I... it doesn't
	matter.  Don't worry, they're fine...
		(he gives the diary back)
	Look, I used to feel that same way, said
	practically those same words, sitting at
	night in a foxhole in Korea...
		(BEAT)
	I've chased you across the country,
	Betty, and I come to find out we're a lot
	more alike than you'd think.

		BETTY
	I thought you were a garbageman of
	humanity, or something.

		CHARLIE
	Yes, but I'd sort of like to put that
	behind me now...



142     INT. ROSA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME	142

Wesley is engrossed in watching "A Reason to Love."  Behind
him, Ballard quietly walks his feet up the wall until he's
completely upside down.  He rubs one foot against the other
until one pantleg is above his cowboy boot. Rosa and Roy
watch.
He finally lifts the boot off.  It falls soundlessly onto his
chest. A small pistol is revealed, holstered above his ankle.
He works the holster open using the edge of the fishtank.

						  136.

Roy and Rosa COUGH LOUDLY at the same time to cover the
noise. Wesley glares at them.

Ballard gets the pistol free. But it falls into the fishtank.
The air goes out of Roy's sails. Ballard has fucked up again.

On screen, Chloe and Jasmine kiss and embrace.  Wesley reacts
as if he was slapped.

		WESLEY
	... goddamn!

Wesley immediately runs the sequence back to view it again.

Ballard KICKS the wall of the fishtank with his cowboy boot.
Roy and Rosa cover the sound again with COUGHING. Wesley
pauses the T.V. and looks around.

		WESLEY (cont'd)
	What's your problem?

Ballard KICKS at the tank again.  But he can't break the
glass. Roy can't take it any more. He launches himself at the
tank, grabs it by the rim and pulls it down on top of
himself.  A torrent of water, fish, plants and gravel pours
down upon him.

		WESLEY (cont'd)
	You stupid piece of fuck!

He leaps at Roy and starts kicking him savagely.  Rosa throws
herself onto Wesley's back, knocking him to the floor.
Ballard paws through the muck, scattering fish and gravel
everywhere.  He spots a glint of metal in the sand.

Wesley struggles out from under Rosa. Just as he gets free,
Ballard FIRES, hitting him TWICE into his chest. Wesley
stares in disbelief at the blood rushing out of him.  Then at
Ballard, as if trying to link the two.

He slumps to the floor and opens his mouth to scream ...

		WESLEY (cont'd)
	D-A-A-A-D-D-D-Y-Y-!!!!

Charlie opens the bedroom door.

		CHARLIE
	Wesley??!

Charlie sees Wesley turn to him as Ballard FIRES again.
Wesley's face explodes.  The flying lead drives Charlie back
to the bedroom.

Crawling through the muck, Roy notices a fish flopping
helplessly on the carpet inches from his face.

						  137.


		ROY
	Those're Japanese koi!

		ROSA
	Yes!  How'd you know that?

		ROY
	You gotta get 'em in water right away!

		BALLARD
	We're in a shootout, Roy!  Shut up about
	the damn fish!

		ROY
	YOU shut up!
		(to Rosa)
	They're beautiful, but get them some
	water.

He gently hands her the fish, then picks up Wesley's nearby
gun.  Rosa nods; she's amazed that he knew what it was.  She
looks at Roy in a slightly different way before crawling away
toward the kitchen.



143-144	OMIT (NOW IN 141, 142)			143-144



145     INT. ROSA'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - SAME TIME		145

Charlie FIRES back from the doorway.

		CHARLIE
	Oh, Christ, they shot my boy!

Enraged, he empties his pistol at the living room.  Ballard
and Roy return fire, and Charlie ducks back in.

		CHARLIE (cont'd)
		(reloading)
	How the hell did this happen?  I'm in a
	goddamn shoot-out!  Wesley?   What the
	fuck happened out there?!

He opens the door, and a bullet slams into the doorjamb near
his head. He ducks back in.

Charlie sags against the wall, looking toward Betty.

		CHARLIE (cont'd)
	That's my son!  My son is dead!

		BETTY
	I'm sorry.

						  138.


		CHARLIE
	You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE
	HERE!

		BETTY
	WAIT A SECOND!  I AM NOT THE REASON
	YOU'RE HERE!  I WAS MINDING MY OWN
	BUSINESS, LIVING A PERFECTLY BORING LIFE
	UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG!

Charlie fights back his grief.

		BETTY (cont'd)
	What do you want from me?

Charlie can't handle the moment.  He breaks for the door,
and BLASTS away. This time he's nicked in the shoulder.  He
stumbles back, losing his balance.  His gun falls and slides
right into Betty's hand.  Equally surprised they stare at one
another.

Charlie slumps over in his defeat as Betty holds a shaky
pistol on him.

		CHARLIE
	Oh shit...



146     INT. ROSA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME	146

Rosa crawls to a flower vase and dumps a second koi into the
water inside.  Roy and Ballard crouch behind the open
archway, using the hanging beads as protection.

		BALLARD
		(checks his gun)
	We need ammo... Go check his jacket, I'll
	cover you.

		ROY
	I'm not going out there!  Let's wait for
	the real police...

		BALLARD
	You gotta go, we're pinned down!

		ROSA
	So why can't we just sneak outside?  Huh?

		BALLARD
	Lady, you don't just run away from
	crime... besides, Betty's in there.

						  139.


		ROY
		(checking)
	You wanna see if he has more shells, go
	ahead.  I say we wait...

		BALLARD
	No, no, no... you don't know shit about
	procedure!  You don't send your best...

		ROY
	I've got the working gun, Elden, me!  You
	wasted all your bullets so you crawl out
	there.

Ballard stares at him in disbelief, then back at the closed
bedroom door. Ballard starts off on his belly.

		BALLARD
	Goddammit...



146A     OMIT						146A



147     INT. ROSA'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - SAME TIME		147

A LONG BEAT passes.  POLICE SIRENS wail in the distance.
Betty moves close to Charlie to look at his shoulder.  He
watches her intently.

		CHARLIE
	If we went out that window right now we'd
	have a chance...

		BETTY
	I better go check on them.

		CHARLIE
	Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered
	me.

		BETTY
	This is really awkward...

The SIRENS are coming closer.  He waves her off.

		CHARLIE
	Ahh, it's too late, anyway.  It's too
	late.
		(BEAT)
	Listen, I could shoot my way out, maybe
	take one of them with me... If you'd
	gimme my gun back.

						  140.


		BETTY
	I'd rather not...

		CHARLIE
	Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in
	some stinking prison.  No way.  I've got
	some professional pride.  And I don't
	want anybody else to get the credit for
	taking me out.

		BETTY
	...what're you saying?

		CHARLIE
	When a Roman general knew a battle was
	lost, he'd throw himself on his sword.

Charlie fumbles in his pocket, then pulls out the photo of
Betty with the cardboard David Ravell.

		CHARLIE (cont'd)
	Did... did you really come here because
	you love this guy?

		BETTY
	Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor.
	I think.

Charlie's sinks slowly to the floor.

		CHARLIE
	So all this...really was because of that
	soap opera?  My son is dead because you
	came out here to be with that doctor?  A
	fake doctor?

		BETTY
	I wouldn't have put it quite that way,
	but...

		CHARLIE
	Wesley didn't even want to come up here.
	He warned me, but I insisted...
		(BEAT)
	I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?

		BETTY
	I don't think I am.

Charlie remains sitting pensively for a long beat.

		CHARLIE
	I want you to listen to me, Betty.
	People don't lie when they're about to
	die.

						  141.

		(BEAT)
	You don't need that doctor.  You don't
	need that actor.  You don't need any man.
	It's not the forties, honey.  You don't
	need anybody. You've got yourself...  and
	that's more than most people can say.

Charlie reaches out slowly and takes the gun from Betty. She
doesn't fight him. He kisses her hand and steps into the
bathroom and closes the door.  A single GUNBLAST sends a
shiver through Betty.



148     INT. LYLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT				148

TV Newscast

CLOSE SHOT of an ANCHORMAN.

		ANCHORMAN
	In a story that police say is bizarre,
	even for Hollywood, a father-son team of
	killers tracked a Kansas soap opera fan
	halfway across the country, only to find
	themselves the victims in a final, bloody
	confrontation...

The Anchorman continues as the CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal
Lyla and George watching television in a plush living room.

		LYLA
	This story is beyond belief, which is
	perfect for us.  It's free advertising
	and it's gonna run for months.

		GEORGE
	I don't think she can do it.  You saw
	what happened.

		LYLA
	You fucked it up.  Who wouldn't freeze in
	those circumstances?  And I don't care
	what her problems are.  She wouldn't be
	the first one in that cast with problems.
	We have nothing to lose by making her an
	offer.

		GEORGE
	What about me?  Don't you wanna know how
	I feel about it?  I'm the one who...

		LYLA
	Why would I give a shit how you feel. And
	I got news for you. I loved your 'icy
	water' idea the other day... I'm toying

						  142.

	with the idea of killing David Ravell off
	in a boating accident.

		GEORGE
	That's not a bad idea.  How many episodes
	before he comes back?

Lyla shakes her head "no."

		GEORGE (cont'd)
	Jesus, don't do that!  If it gets around
	that you fired me, I'll never land a
	pilot.

		LYLA
	Then do as you're told. Get her back.



149     INT. TIP TOP DINER - DAY				 149

George and Betty sit across from one another in a booth.
Betty listens patiently.  Her former co-workers try to remain
busy but can't help gawking.

		GEORGE
	I'm sorry for what I did.  It was
	inexcusable.  I'm sorry for the things I
	said, and for not respecting you, and for
	all the stupid things that...

Darlene approaches, puts a piece of paper on the table.

		DARLENE
	When you have a minute...

		GEORGE
	Look, I don't really like the whole idea
	of autographs, and I'm kind of in the
	middle of...

		DARLENE
	Don't flatter yourself.  It's the check.

She walks off.

		GEORGE
	Oh.  Of course... sorry.

		BETTY
		(grabbing it up)
	My treat.  You were saying... something
	about how stupid you've been?

						  143.


		GEORGE
	Right... I was.  I was an idiot, plain
	and simple, and I hope you can find it in
	your heart to forgive me.  How's that?

		BETTY
	Kinda like you'd been saying it since you
	got on the plane...

		GEORGE
	I have... did it sound that bad?

		BETTY
	Mmm-hmm.  Listen, I forgive you, Mr.
	McCord...

		GEORGE
	George...

		BETTY
	... George.  I do.
		(BEAT)
	My best friend once said if you were any
	handsomer it would be a crime...

		GEORGE
	Thanks...

		BETTY
	... it's too bad you're such an asshole.
	'S the only thing that Del was ever right
	about.

George winces... accepts it.

		GEORGE
	No, that's... okay.  Fair enough.
		(BEAT)
	So, now that we've sort of settled the
	'asshole' thing, is there any chance
	you'll come back to the show?  At all?



150     INT. TV DINER - DAY				150

Dr. David Ravell sits with Nurse Betty in a diner, catching a
bite to eat before going back on shift.  They smile at one
another over their meals.

		BETTY
	... there's always a chance, David.

		DAVID
	Right.  But will there be a tomorrow, and
	the next day, and the next?

						  144.


		BETTY
		(whispering to him)
	Doctor, if you were any handsomer it'd be
	a crime...

		DAVID
	I guess that means you're free tonight.
	Of course, it's up to you...

		BETTY
	No, it's up to us.  I love you, David.
	And I want to see you tomorrow, and the
	next day, and the next day...
		(they kiss)

153     INT. ROSA'S APARTMENT - DAY			  153

sips a cup of coffee.  HER WAITER stands nearby with one eye
on a TV set that broadcasts "A Reason to Love" in Italian.

						  145.


		BETTY
	Could I get some service here, please?

Without looking, the waiter approaches, tops off her cup and
moves back to watching the show.  Betty smiles knowingly at
this, takes a sip and settles back in her seat.  Slowly, the
world passes by.
