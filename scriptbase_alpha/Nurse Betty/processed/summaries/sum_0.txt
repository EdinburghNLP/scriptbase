A Kansas City waitress with dreams of becoming a nurse becomes delusional after seeing her no-good car salesman husband murdered.
Becoming delusional from shock, she becomes convinced that she is the former fiancée of her soap opera idol.
What she also believes is that the soap opera is real and goes to LA to find the hospital where he works as a cardiologist.
Meanwhile, her husband's murderers are searching for the drugs stolen by her husband and, as luck would have it, they are stored in the trunk of the car she drove off in.
Freeman, an aging hit man planning his retirement after this job, also becomes delusional about the woman he is tracking.
