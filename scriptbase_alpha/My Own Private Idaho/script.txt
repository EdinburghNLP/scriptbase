VIEWS OF THE CITY OF Portland Oregon digressing into the seedy
areas of the small city.

ARCADES, and yellow storefronts, of PORNOGRAPHIC BOOKSHOPS.

A FEW YOUNG MEN LOITER IN FRONT OF ONE OF THE BOOKSHOPS
SOLICITOUSLY AND EYE A CUSTOMER.

WHO ENTERS THE BOOXSHOP.

INSIDE, WE SEE:

Counters displaying COLORFUL COMIC-LIKE plastic covered MAGAZINE
and BOOK COVERS with names like HONCHO - BUTCH - JOYBOY.
INDICATING A Homoerotic section of the bookshop.

GROUPS OF MEN loiter about the magazine shop flipping through the
books and disappearing in and out of curtained doors.

THE COUNTERMAN is on the phone.

Next to him is a particularly interesting YOUNG MAN on the cover
of one of the magazines - a bright yellow background, jeans open
two buttons on the top, shirtless wearing a black cowboy hat.
This character is named SCOTT.

FULL VIEW of the MAGAZINE cover as Scott comes to life - and
talks to us.

          SCOTT
     I never thought I could be a real
     model, you know fashion-shit,
     cause I'm better at full body
     stuff It.8 okay so long as the
     photographer doesn't come on to
     you and expect something for no
     pay I'm trying to make a living,
     you know, and I like to be
     professional 'Course if the guy
     wants to pay me, then shit/yeah.
     Here I am for him. I'll sell my
     ass, I do it on the street all the
     time for cash. And I'll be on the
     cover of a book. It's when you
     start doing it for free that you
     start to grow wings, Right, Mike?

ACROSS THE AISLE ON ANOTHER SHELF IS ANOTHER COVER OF A MAGAZINE,
AND ANOTHER YOUNG MAN ON THE COVER STARTS TO MOVE AND SPEAK,
ADDRESSING SCOTT.

This character is named MIKE. (MIKE SHOULD BE DIFFERENT FROM
SCOTT, MIKE SHOULD BE BLOND AND SCOTT SHOULD BE BROWN HAIRED,
ALTHOUGH BOTH POSSESS A CERTAIN PAINFUL DOWN AND OUT HANDSOMENESS
OF A STREET HUSTLER.)

          MIKE
     What are you talking about? What
     wings?

          SCOTT
     Wings, man, you grow Wings and
     become a FAIRY

          MIKE
     I ain't no fairy.

ANOTHER COVERBOY INTERRUPS MIKE AND SCOTT'S DISCUSSION, BUTTING
IN.

          COVERBOY
     He ain't saying you is a fairy;
     faggot, he's saying that if you go
     working for free then you has no
     choice, you turn into a fairy,
     with wings and all. That's all he
     mean, dunk.

          MIKE (to Scott)
     Well, nevertheless, what do you
     care about doing stuff for free or
     for money, shit You're going to
     inherit a hunch of money, you
     might as well do it for free.

          COVERBOY
     Is that right, sweetie?

OTHER COVERBOYS PERK UP AND START FLIRTING WITH SCOTT

          COVERBOY 2
     How much is a bunch of money;
     honey?

          COVERBOY 3
     What are you doing on the cover of
     that magazine, slumming?

Scott listens to all of them then looks back at Mike. Mike
smiles.

          SCOTT
     (to us)
     Actually, I'm on the street to
     settle a bet with my goddamned
     stone-faced old man. I've decided to
     live away from home for three years.
     To prove a point. That I can live on
     my own. And to appreciate the value
     of a dollar. And Mike is right,
     there, I am going to inherit money.
     A lot of money

IdAho

The desert in the daytime.

MIKE enters the frame in front of a blue sky filled with white
clouds. He has a Texaco gas station attendant's shirt on with a
name tag that reads: BILL (not Mike, his name).

The clouds are puffy against a deep blue sky. The road is red.
Purple mountains surround Mike on all sides far in the distance,
ten miles away. Mike looks in front of him at a long stretch of
road that disappears into the horizon.

Mike looks at his wristwatch on his arm. He times how long it
takes to walk ten steps down the road.

Ten seconds. He glances back at a duffel bag. The duffel bag
falls over.

Mike looks at the picturesque sights surrounding him. A wind
sends a tumbleweed into the air. He takes ten steps back to his
duffle bag and checks watch again.

The sun is now setting.

          MIKE
     (to himself)
     You can always tell where you are by
     the way the road looks. Like I Just
     know that I been to this place
     before. I Just know that I been
     stuck here like this one fuckin'
     time before, you know that?

ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD A JACKRABBIT IS LISTENING TO HIM.

          MIKE
     There ain't no other road on earth
     that looks like this road. I mean,
     exactly like this road.  (sniffs)
     One of a kind. (Sniffs) Like
     someone's face.  Like a fucked up
     face...

THE ROAD HAS A DEFINITE FACE. TWO DISTANT CACTUS FOR EYES - A
CLOUD SHADOW FOR A MOUTH, MOUNTAINS FOR HAIR.

          MIKE
     Once you see it, even for a
     second, you remember it, and you
     better not forget it, you gotta
     remember people and who they are,
     right? Friends and enemies. You
     gotta remember the road and where
     it is too...

MIKE SUDDENLY LUNGES AT THE LITTLE RABBIT LISTENING TO HIS CHAT
ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, AND THE RABBIT RUNS FOR HIS LIFE.

          MIKE
     I Just love to scare things... I
     don't know. It gives me a sense
     of.... Power.

Mike thinks about the loneliness of the road.

          MIKE
     This is nowhere. I'll bet that
     nobody is ever going to drive down
     this road. I'll be stuck here
     forever.

Mike looks at the road stressfully. The road looks back. He looks
at the road   his eyes growing heavy. The road looks back...

Mikes yawns.

          MIKE'S VOICE OVER
     I don't know when it was I
     recognized I had this disease.

Mike looks like a backwoods character who fits into the terrain.
Mike makes strange movements, like he is having a sort of
epileptic fit, then yawns like he is very tired, again.

          MIKE'S VOICE OVER
     Sometimes I'll be in one place,
     and I'll close my eyes...

MIKE CLOSES HIS EYES. THEN A WHOLE RITUAL OF EVENTS HAPPENS, HIS
EYES TURN BACK IN HIS HEAD AND HE BEGINS TO SHAKE ALL OVER. THEN
ALL GOES BLACK.

          MIKE'S VOICE OVER
     When I open them again, I'll be in
     a completely different
     surrounding.

When Mike opens his eyes, he is in downtown PORTLAND, OREGON.

A LOUD BUS drives by Mike's view in the city. He is asleep, then
wakes enough to see other UNKNOWN KIDS rifling his pockets in a
doorway, as Mike sleepily looks
on.

          SUBTITLES
     It's kind of like time travel.
     It's kind of good.

MIKE CLOSES HIS EYES AGAIN, AND WHEN HE OPENS THEM HE IS BACK IN
THE COUNTRY. BUT THIS TIME A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TERRAIN. LIKE A
LONG TIME HAS PASSED. HE IS ALSO WEARING DIFFERENT CLOTHES.

MIKE CHECKS HIS WATCH AGAIN. He looks happy at the passage of
time.

          MIKE
     Yeah. It's kind of good. Passes
     the time. Unwanted as it is.

MIKE LEANS AGAINST THE DUFFLE BAG WITH HIM. HE LOOKS INTO THE
FIELD next to him. The wind blows a paper cup into the air.

Mike watches the cup tumble in the air, and with a few notes, a
GUITAR follows. Then an uprooted cactus.

The paper cup, cactus and guitar lyrically trade places in the
air, and are followed by a large barn, which twists and turns,
then crashes directly into the middle of the road.

On the, road. Riding in the back of a pickup truck. Mike's shirt
ruffles wildly in the wind, traveling at 60 mph.

And the truck disappears into the sun, toward a steep mountain
range.

LAS VeGAs

Mike is walking down a LONELY ALLEYWAY in the city. ALL OF A
SUDDEN he is surrounded by three BLACK BOYS, who are smiling and
joking.

          BLACK 1
     SAY, WHITE BOY, where you goin'?

Black 1 pulls out a knife and waves it at Mike.

          BLACK 1
     What's in the sack. Let's see.

Mike fights with the guy for his sack. The Black cuts Mike's
hands with his knife but Mike won't let go.

In terror he watches his hands get cut, but he won't let go. Mike
starts to yawns and does the jitters to the Black's amazement and
drops to the ground. Scottie, the older boy on the magazine
cover, comes to Mike's aid. He pushes the Black boy over, throws
some trash cans in their direction.

          BLACK 1
     This gonna be fun. Come on...

Scottie keeps fighting them off.

          SCOTT
     Man, what do you want from us, we
     haven't got anything.

The Blacks chuckle. Then they stop and slowly walk away from
Scott who hovers protectively around Mike's body on the ground.

          BLACK (o.s.)
      Faggot!

We are in the city of Las Vegas in the daytime. (We are aware of
this because one character, RAY, is reading the Las Vegas
Chronicle.) Mike sleeps, as a shopkeeper washes his windows and
three other street kids, Gary, Ray and Scottie, are hanging
around on the corner with him.

Gary is hitting a public wastebasket with the end of a stick as a
MAN in a MERCEDES BENZ drives by them very slowly, and looks at
each one of the boys individually. Gary pauses for a moment and
poses.

          RAY
     (to the man in the car) What's up?

          MAN (in German)
     [Entschuldiging, Junge...]

The man in the car speeds off.

INT. CAR DAY.

THE MAN has the look of Rainer Fassbinder and Geraldo Rivera as
the same man; is of average build and has a wash of hair gracing
his forehead that looks quite foreign. He turns to the right
three times, as he is circling his car.

OUT THE WINDOW OF THE CAR, we see the boys again.

EXT. STREET

          GARY
     What's this guy want, think he
     wants to party?

          SCOTT
     He said "Entschuldiging, Junge."

          GARY
     What's that mean? "Suck my dick?"
     Does he want to suck my dick?

          SCOTT
     It means, "Excuse me, boys."

          GARY
     How the fuck do you know.

          SCOTT
     I've studied German, in prep
     school.

          GARY
     You know, Scottie, I don't know
     when to believe you.

          SCOTT
     Here he comes again.

THE MAN leans out the window of his car.

          MAN
     HELLO?

Gary leans into the man's car.

          GARY
     Hey, dude.

          MAN
     (speaks with a thick German
     accent)
     Excuse me. Can I speak to the young
     man over there, with the blond hair,
     ya?

          GARY
     Who, that kid there? You can't
     talk with him now, he's asleep.

          MAN
     Can you wake him up?

          GARY
     No, you can't wake him... he......
     but, what about me? Don't you want
     to talk with me?

The man is not interested in talking to Gary. He shakes his head
no, bothered by Gary.

          SCOTT
     (speaking fluent German)
     Was willist du in Gottesname mit uns
     Juenge?  Mach' es flar oder fanre
     ab!
     (What in the hell do you want with
     us young kids, be specific or get
     out.)

          MAN
     (surprised)
     Du bisst sehr intelligent mit deinem
     Aksent..  Fuer elnen Puppejunge.
     (You are very clever with an accent
     like that.. for a street boy.)

THE MAN IN THE CAR SPEEDS OFF.

          GARY
     Alright then, asshole!

VIEW of Mike's sleeping face.

INSIDE OF MIKE'S thoughts. He is flying over the city streets,
above the Mercedes Benz, effortlessly hovering and gilding above
it, between the buildings.  Like a bird.

Mike wakes and looks at Scottie, who is talking to
Gary.

          MIKE'S THOUGHTS
     The first time I met Scott, I had
     a feeling he was a sort of comic
     book hero. He was always saying
     the right thing at the right
     moment, and standing up for me
     when there was no reason to. Look
     at his face now, when the sunlight
     shines off his lower lip, like it
     is the face of some sort of
     statue. Strong and soft at the
     same time. I never could figure
     out what Scott was doing here with
     us on the street in the first
     place, like he was on some sort of
     crusade, to help the poor. Because
     he really did come from a rich
     Portland family. I know because he
     brought me to his house one day
     and showed me around. I mean, wow,
     they were rich I They even had a
     swimming pool. Scott's the only
     kid that I had ever met that had a
     swimming pool. I'd make a bet with
     anybody right now, that Scott is a
     saint or a hero, or some such
     higher placed person.

Meanwhile...
Gary and Ray are talking. Ray, who is a Chicano street kid, is
looking poetically off into the distance.

          RAY
     My father was a gaucho. But nobody
     gonna find him. He killed a guy
     and split. Nobody gonna find that
     fuck. I never gonna find him.

Ray spits into the gutter and the spit drifts in a small stream
made by the shop-owner who was washing his windows, down the
street and into drainage grating.

View of MIKE as he closes his eyes, oblivious to what is going on
around him.

The music in a DISCO blares, at night, and all we can see is
Mike's face, sleeping. The disco MUSIC STOPS, and the lights go
up.

A broom passes by Mike's head.

Finally, THE MANAGER'S SHOES appear at his head.

          MANAGER (o. s.)
     What's wrong with him?  Passed
     out?

The shoes prod Mike.

          MANAGER (o. s.)
     Hey, wake up.

Mike wakes up in a WARD ROOM BED in the daytime.

He looks around him. The room has a lot of light, windows
practically on all sides of the room. There are other DETOX men
and women in other beds. Mike gets up and starts to walk out, but
he is wearing a gown.

A nurse stops him.

          NURSE
     Excuse me. Are you all right?

          MIKE
     Yeah. I'm fine.

(Mike looks around the room.)

          NURSE

     If you're going to leave us, it's
     okay, but we need you to sign out,
     and you'll need to get your
     clothes from downstairs.

          MIKE
     Oh. Yeah. (he pauses and looks
     around the place.) Do you live
     here?

          NURSE
     Why... no. But sometimes I feel
     like I do.

The nurse walks him over to a clipboard on a desk. Mike signs the
board, and she gives him a receipt.

          MIKE
     What's this?

          NURSE

     That's Just a receipt. if you
     don't want it. You can throw it
     away. That's what most people do
     with it.

Then we cut to Mike's face at night. As his eyes open he takes a
look around him, a little dazed, trying to figure where he is. We
see he is under a store awning. A lot of fog is rolling across
the street.

A twenty-eight-year-old woman stops in a Mercedes Benz sedan,
similar to the one that the German man was driving. She motions
Mike to get inside the car.

Dazed, Mike looks at the car, then responds.

          MIKE
     This chick is living in a new car
     ad.

Inside a hallway entrance to the woman's home. Mike and the woman
take off their Jackets.

          MIKE
     This is like a dream. A pretty
     woman never picks me up.

Mike begins to caress her arm.

          LADY
     They Don't? Well. I Don't see why
     not...

          MIKE
     Is this your house?


          LADY (caressing his head)
     Yes...

Mike follows the woman into her...

Living room where sit Scottie and Gary on a plush sofa. Mike sees
them.

          MIKE

     Oh...

Mike sits down in an easy chair next to the sofa.

          MIKE
     What's up, Gary? Scottie?

          GARY
     HEY, DUDE.

          LADY
     You men make yourselves
     comfortable, and I'll be right
     back. There're cokes in the
     refrigerator - help yourself.

They watch her go.

          SCOTTIE
     She's cool. She Just likes to have
     three guys, 'cause - it takes her
     a little while to get warmed up.
     It's normal. Nothing kinky.

          MIKE
     Oh.

Mike looks around the room. Gary leans closer to Mike.

          GARY
     Hey, did you get into that Van
     Halen concert last night?

          MIKE
     I've never been to a concert,
     dude.

Interior of the Woman's bedroom. Mike undresses. He waits by the
side of the bed and takes a last drag on a
cigarette and puts it out. Then the woman arrives. lets down her
negligee and approaches Mike like an EARTH MOTHER, slowly, big
breasted, warm, comforting.

As she approaches, Mike begins to see a familiar face. He is
upset when he looks into her eyes.  And he begins to
spasmodically shake then he grows sleepy, and finally, as she is
upon him, he passes out.

Outside, Gary and Scottie struggle with Mike's body.

They plop Mike down on the corner, under a streetlight, fold his
arms under his stomach and bend him over so he is sitting up
against the light pole.

          SCOTT
     (putting money into his pocket) He
     always does this! I'm surprised he
     makes money at all.

          GARY
     How do we tell if he's okay?

          SCOTT
     Well, he's not dead.

Scott listens to his heart.

          SCOTT
     Listen.

Gary listens.

          SCOTT
     He's not dead. He's Just passed
     out. It's a condition. It's called
     narcolepsy.

          GARY
     Scared the shit out of her. What
     causes it. Sex?

          SCOTT
     Stress. Some hustler, huh?

Silence for a second.

          GARY
     Where are we going to take him?

Scott lifts Mike's body up and carries him to a soft carpet of
grass on the edge of a lawn. Scott looks around to see if it is
okay. Then he speaks to Mike even though he is asleep.

          SCOTT
     Hey, little brother. You stay
     here, and when you wake up, Just
     come back into town. I'll be there
     waiting for you. I figure you're
     going to be safer here in this
     comfy neighborhood than in the
     city. I grew up in a neighborhood
     like this. It'll be safe here.

Scottie hides a tear. Then he takes his Jacket off and puts it
over Mike, then leaves him there.

Mike's face is lying down with his nose pressed against a leafy
ground in the daytime.

He wakes up, stands, makes his way up a slope and out to the
street. He brushes himself off as the Mercedes Benz shows up
again. Mike recognizes it, and walks up to the window of the car.
It is the MAN, though, not the lady. The Man speaks with a German
accent - and he is about 35 years old. HIS NAME IS HANS.

          MIKE
     Hi.

          HANS
     Say....

Hans reads Mike's shirt.

          HANS
     Say, Bill. What's happening?

Mike brushes himself off and walks down the road, thinking that
the guy is weird.

          MIKE
     Nothing much.

Hans drives alongside Mike in his car.

          HANS
     Do you want a lift? Bill?

          MIKE
     Hey, isn't this the lady's car?

          HANS
     Is Alena a friend of yours?  She's
     a friend of mine. Any friend of
     Alena's is a friend of mine. Do
     you want to be my friend?

          MIKE
     Not really.

          HANS
     Get in and I'll take you
     someplace. Yes? Where do you want
     to go?

Mike doesn't respond, and walks on.

He pauses a moment, and looks at the houses in the neighborhood.
He looks down the street and can see Hans stopped in his car. The
guy gets out, and leans against the car.

          MIKE
     This guy is a pervert. I can tell.

To Hans:

          MIKE
     Go home!

THE HOUSES LINE THE STREET, EACH WITH A LITTLE CALIFORNIA STYLE
GARDEN. MIKE CAN SEE ALL THE ROOFS OF THE HOUSES LIFT OFF, AND
THE FURNITURE INSIDE EACH HOUSE  FLY OUT AND CIRCLE IN THE AIR.
MIKE GETS THE JITTERS AND PASSES OUT.

THE MERCEDES BENZ PULLS UP NEXT TO HIS HEAD, WHICH IS NOW ON THE
GROUND.

PORtLAnd

When Mike wakes up he is in Scottie's arms. They sit under a
statue in a park. The statue is of two Indians pointing out
across the horizon, and on the base of the statue is written: The
Coming of the White Man.

Mike looks at Scott and then at the new surroundings.
At the Broadway Cafe Mike bites into a hamburger.

          MIKE
     How'd we get home?

          SCOTT
     That German guy. Hans. He brought
     you downtown, you were passed out.
     He said he was heading to
     Portland, so I asked him for a
     ride.

          MIKE
     I don't remember any German guy.

          SCOTT
     Well. You were sleeping.

          MIKE
     How much do you make off me while
     I'm sleeping?

          SCOTT
     Just a ride, Mike. I don't make
     anything. What, you think that I
     sell your body while you are
     asleep.

          MIKE
     Yeah.

Scott sips from a coffee cup.

          SCOTT
     No, Mike. I'm on your side.

He puts down the cup. Mike knows Scottie always tells the truth.
Mike is a little embarrassed, that he has maybe offended Scott's
honor.

          MIKE
     I was Just kidding, dude.

          SCOTT
     Gary's up here somewhere. He left
     three days ago, he flew up with
     some John.

          MIKE
     Exotic. Have you seen your dad?

          SCOTT
     Are you kidding?

          MIKE
     I'd visit my dad, if he was here.

          SCOTT
     I have to take care of you.

          MIKE
     How about your mom?

          SCOTT
     No.

          MIKE
     That lady. She looked like. My
     mother.

          SCOTT
     Is that why you passed out?

          MIKE
     Yeah. I mean. I don't know. She
     really looked like my mother. I
     must have been imagining things.

A pause.

The Broadway Cafe is beginning to pick up in business.  The table
where Scott and Mike sit is in front of a large window, and it is
semi-circular in shape. Scottie spies Gary across the street.

He bounds up out of his chair and Mike watches him as he goes to
the door, kicks it open and yells to Gary.

          SCOTT
     HEY' You dick!

Gary sees Scott and runs across the street.

Later in the BROADWAY CAFE, there are other street kids hanging
around the table.

Scott has his arm around a girl named DENISE, who has a lot of
make up on and long stringy hair and who carries a teddy bear.
Denise is crying and Scott is consoling her.

          MIKE'S THOUGHTS:
     It was almost as if Scott was on
     some sort of crusade or mission,
     when you checked him out.  He
     could make you feel good right at
     the very time that you felt so
     bad. I remember there were many
     times that I had been sobbing in
     Scott's arms and he was helping me
     out too. He was the great
     protector of us all, and the great
     planner. He gave us hope in the
     future. Even though there was no
     future. There must have been real
     trouble at home, though, for Scott
     not to want to visit his father.

Scott strokes Denise's hair adoringly and gives her a kiss every
now and then.

Mike looks across the table at CARL, a skinny kid with black hair
and a large floppy sports cap, and GARY, who is talking with him.

          MIKE'S THOUGHTS
     That's Carl. He's always around
     the Broadway, he didn't run away
     from home like a lot of these kids
     did. He had a mom, and no dad, at
     least they didn't know where he
     was. And one day, he came home to
     the apartment where they lived,
     and there was no mom anymore
     either. He didn't know where she
     went. That was sir months ago.

MARY, an older, wiser street prostitute who is chain smoking Kool
cigarettes.

          MIKE'S THOUGHTS
     That's Mary over there. She was a
     mean old chick. She was maybe
     thirty now. Old, old. Somebody
     once told me that in the past,
     Mary had this enemy, a chick that
     had turned her in. And Mary had
     gone off and kicked this chick to
     death right in the street in front
     of everybody. I don't know if it's
     true, but I watched out, Just in
     case. I was afraid of Mary. And
     everyone else was too.

Mary takes a drag from her cigarette and blows smoke in Mike's
face.

Scott notices this. But he attends to Denise's problems.

MIKE'S THOUGHTS
(as he coughs)
This was our little round table, a
point around which everything else
revolved. It was our "center." It was
like our home. Our living room. Not
everyone was the best of friends, but
everyone knew everyone else, and we
kind of stuck together.

Mike on the street. He watches as a man carrying a large bag of
tin cans, crosses at a crosswalk. Mike steps up to him and begins
walking. His name is MARTY.

          MIKE
     Hey Marty. What's goin' on?

          MARTY
     Is that you Mike? Hey, what's new
     with you? You look pretty good.

          MIKE
     How many you got so far today?

          MARTY
     I reckon that I picked up about
     twenty-three bucks so far with
     these cans, and some I got stashed
     back in the bushes. You know the
     old hiding place?

          MIKE
     Wow!

          MARTY
     Don't tell anybody, though. Just
     between you and me. You need a
     place to stay?

          MIKE
     I always need a place to stay,
     dude.

          MARTY
     Yeah, well, I'm under the bridge.
     You can Join me if you like.

          MIKE
     Yeah, I think I'll rooftop it
     tonight. I'm hanging with a
     friend.

          MARTY
     Am I walking too fast for you?

          MIKE

     No, but I'll see you around. See
you under the bridge.

          MARTY

     Okay, Mike.

Mike stops walking with the guy and he splits down the street at
a fast clip.

Inside the BROADWAY CAFE, Mike smokes a cigarette at the round
table and watches Gary and Carl playing keepaway with Denise's
teddy bear. Denise is swearing, using profanities that are
unusual for a girl.

Night. Mike walks through a dark wet troubled inner-city alley
and on the other side, there is a parked car. In the car sits a
man in his 40's, bestial, good looking but overweight. He beeps
his car horn at Mike.

Mike pauses, lights a cigarette coolly and walks to the car and
leans in the window.

          MIKE
     Hey - what's up?

Int. MOTEL, nighttime.

The man is naked in the background standing In front of a mirror
in a motel bathroom, as Mike sits naked on a bed in front of a
t.v. set laughing at the show that is on.

We see various still compositions of the two making love.

Afield. Day. Two figures cross the field. One is Bob Pigeon, a
man in his fifties, and the other, his manservant, Budd. Because
of his girth, Bob has problems crossing the field.

          BUDD
     Jesus. ..the things we've seen...
     do you remember a thing since we
     moved from graffiti bridge?

          BOB
     No more of that, Budd.

          BUDD
     Ha-ha, what a crazy night.

Above the two walking figures, Gary wakes near a heating duct
atop a ten story building. He yawns, looks down at the street and
spies Bob and Budd.

GARY'S VIEW: a tiny Bob and Budd are making their way across a
field.

          GARY
     Hey, Scottie, here comes that fat
     pig himself!!! He owes me money!

Scottie, atop an adjacent building peeks his head over the edge.
The two guys are relatively close to one another but far from the
street.

          SCOTT
     Who?

          GARY

     You know, the fat one... Pigeon!


          SCOTT

     He stole my shoes, the dick!

          GARY

     Hey, everybody, here comes Bob the
     chiseler!

He yells to the other buildings and other street kids to wake up.
Scottie pours an old paper cup of Coca-Cola over Bob and Budd
below.

          GARY
     Look out, it's raining Coke!

Bob hears the show atop the buildings.

          BOB
     Ah, I think my friends can see I
     am back from Boise.

Bob looks worried and happy at the same time, not knowing if they
are friend or foe. He shields himself from the Coke sprinkles.

          BOB
     Do you see any clouds in the sky,
     Budd?

          BUDD
     No, Bob.

The Derelict Hotel.

Budd and Bob enter the threshold of a busted up but operating
hotel. There is a fire in a trashcan turned upside down, with
holes poked in it.

Budd looks around the hotel.

          BUDD
     Is Jane Lightwork alive, Bob?

          BOB
     She's alive, Budd.

          BUDD
     Is she holding on?

          BOB
     Old... old, Budd.

          BUDD
     She must be old, she has no
     choice...

THE TWO sit at a larger fire deeper into the derelict hotel.

          BUDD
     I remember her daughter, she died
     years ago... of old age. She must
     be old, all right. That was before
     I came to Clements Inn.

          BOB
     (warming by the fire)
     Ahh...

          BUDD

     Jesus... the things that we've
     seen. Aren't I right, Bob? Aren't
     I right?

          BOB

     We have seen the light at the end
     of the tunnel...

          BUDD
     That we have, that we have... in
     fact Bob, we have. Jesus... the
     things that we've seen.

Scott drinks from a beer can inside the derelict hotel, tosses it
to a young boy, laughs, wipes his mouth and puts his lit
cigarette into the mouth of Gary, making his way to some steps,
through a circle of girls, kisses Denise, who we remember from
the Broadway Cafe, and charges up the steps.

Inside the hotel on a staircase landing, Scottie passes a couple
of figures, one is asleep and one is awake.

          SCOTTIE
     Where's Bob?

          A BOY
     Fast asleep.

          BUDD
     And he's snoring like a horse.

SCOTTIE OPENS A DOOR AT THE TOP OF THE STEPS AND WALKS INTO A
ROOM, INTERRUPTING MIKE, WHO STANDS OVER BOB'S SNORING BODY.

Mike coolly holds up a wad of bills and a folded envelope of
cocaine.

          MIKE
     I picked his pocket.

          SCOTTIE
     (whispering)

     What did you get, dude?

          MIKE

     Just this.

Scottie takes the cocaine from him, sits down at the foot of the
bed and begins to unfold the packet. Bob turns in the bed and the
rush of air from the sheets blows the white powder out of the
packet.

          BOB

     What the hell?

Mike laughs.

          BOB

     What time is it, son?

          SCOTTIE
     (climbing in bed with Bob)
     What do you care?

Bob, dazed, is looking around himself, like he is being had.

          SCOTTIE
     (amusing Mike)
     Why, you wouldn't even look at a
     clock, unless hours were lines of
     coke, dials looked like the signs of
     gay bars, or time itself was a fair
     hustler in black leather... isn't
     that right, dude?

Bob staggers out of bed retching and spitting. Then back into his
waking stupor, feeling something is being put over on him.

          SCOTT
     There's no reason to know the
     time. We are timeless.

Bob checks his wallet.

          BOB
     Aren't you forgetting, Scottie my
     boy, [A GOVERNOR'S SON], that we
     who steal, do so at midnight?

Bob's money and cocaine are gone. Bob turns angry and bellows.

          BOB
     What the...who ripped me off?
     Budd!!! Budd!!!

Stairs again

          BUDD
     Yes, Bob!!!

Budd stands at the stoop and comes through the door, Just as Bob
is running out.

          BOB
     I fell asleep and have been
     robbed!

Jane!!!

The room below.

Jane Lightwork, the owner of the established hotel, comes to
arms. She is very old.

          JANE
     You'd think that I could keep the
     peace in my house...

Scott and Mike laugh. Mike gets down on his hands and knees and
tries to scoop up a little cocaine from the floor.

Bedroom.

Hall

          JANE
     Bob, Bob we'll find your drugs.
     We'll find them.

Another hall.

Bob is storming down it in a rage, people opening doors of the
rooms.

          BOB
     Jane, I know you well enough...

Yet another hall.

Hotel dwellers are watching Jane move down the hall answering
Bob.

          JANE
     I know you, ~ you owe me money,
     Bob, and now you pick a fight with
     me, and are disturbing the peace
     of my hotel.

MAIN derelict hall of the hotel.

Bob parades, in his night clothes, in front of a gathering of
outcasts in the hotel.

          BOB
     This hotel is full of thieves...
     Junkies!

          JANE
     You are the thief!

          BOB
     They picked my pocket!

LAUGHTER from the throngs of outcasts. Jane enters a balcony
overlook of the main hall. Mike and Scott enter, arms around each
other, laughing.

          JANE
     It's impossible to board a dozen
     or so men and women who live
     honestly and have the others live
     like Junkies.

One of the dwellers listening to the argument is shooting up as
they speak. We see a close view of the needle and Bob running
around in the background.

Bob makes his way next to Scott.

          BOB
     You have corrupted me, Scottie, I
     was an innocent before I met you.
     ..and now look at me.. just a
     little better than wicked. I used
     to be a virtuous man...

Scottie is laughing at him.

          BOB
     '''well, virtuous enough. I swore
     a little. I never gambled more
     than seven times a week. Poker. I
     never picked up a street boy more
     than once a quarter...

Scottie laughs.
          BOB
     ... of an hour. Bad company has
     corrupted me. I'll be darned if I
     haven't forgotten what the inside
     of a church looks like.

          MIKE
     Where do you find your strike
     tonight, Bob?

          SCOTTIE
     I see a good change for Bob to
     make. From Stealing to Preaching.

          BOB
     Stealing is my vocation, Scott.
     It's not a sin for a man to labor
     at his vocation.

          GARY
     Hey... .......

The three gather around Gary.

          GARY
     Very early tomorrow morning, there
     will be small time rock and roll
     promoters coming back from their
     show. Every night, they walk home
     with the loot and they stop by the
     Grotto Bar, one mile away from
     here, and more often than not
     they've been drinking already. If
     we can't steal from them on their
     way to the bar, we can get them
     when they come out. See, dude?

          MIKE
     I'm not gonna rob anybody.  I'd
     rather sell my ass. Straight and
     simple. It's less risky.

          BOB
     So long as I don't know these guys
     personally. ..it's okay with me.

          GARY
     They're from Beaverton. New to the
     business...

          MIKE
     Not me. I'm not going along on
     this crackpot scheme. Especially
     since Gary thought it up.

          BOB
     Come oft it, Mikey. Find a better
     way to make a buck. Something to
     fall back on, other than your ass.

          MIKE
     Scott's inheritance.

Bob walks away from the two others.

          SCOTT
     (whispering)
     Come along, Mikey. I have a joke I
     wanna play... a joke I can't pull
     off alone...

Mike laughs and joins Bob, hugging him around his fat belly.

          BOB
     Oh, my sweetheart, come and rob
     with us tomorrow.

          MIKE
     I was going to come anyway.

SCOTT hugs the others too.

          MIKE
     We'll be rich!!!

Scottie dances away.

          SCOTT
     Provide for us, oh great
     psychedelic Papa!

Scottie grabs Denise and kisses her then begins to leave through
the door. He throws her to Mike who catches her and runs off with
her.

          SCOTT
     Good catch dude. ..and meet me on
     three street!

Scott leaves, Bob follows him:
0utside the derelict hotel.

          BOB
     Scott. When you inherit your
     fortune, on your twenty-first
     birthday, let's see. ..how far
     away is this?

          SCOTT
     One week away, Bob, just one more
     week.

          BOB
     Let's not call ourselves robbers,
     but Diannah's foresters. Gentlemen
     of the shade. Minions of the Moon.
     Men of good government.

          SCOTT
     (under his breath)
     When I turn twenty-one, I don't want
     any more of this life. My mother and
     father will be surprised at the
     incredible change. It will impress
     them more when such a fuck up like
     me turns good than if I had been a
     good son all along. All the past
     years I will think of as one big
     vacation. At least it wasn't as
     boring as schoolwork. All my bad
     behavior I'm going to throw away to
     pay my debt. I will change when
     everybody expects it the least.

Scott turns and leaves.

          BOB
     And you will become a hard roller,
     a hatchet man for your old man.

Scott laughs to himself, because he knows Bob is misunderstanding
him. Bob is part of the past life that he says he is going to
throw away.

          SCOTT
     No! You will be the hatchet man,
     Bob, that will be your job, and so
     there will rarely be a job
     hatcheted. It will be one big
     endless party, won't it?

Bob laughs. Scott walks across a field.

          BOB
     Well, at least my little friend
     has offered me a job. They are so
     good to me.

Inside the Broadway Cafe. Day.

Denise and Mike hang out together. Both are smoking cigarettes
which have made a billow of smoke that hangs over the table that
is in the front window.

          DENISE
     Moms are great, because, you know,
     I could always go to my mom and
     say, hey I need a new lipstick,
     and she would always give me money
     for that. That was great.

          MIKE
     I only saw my mom once, but I
     remember what she looked like. She
     was very beautiful.

          DENISE
     What do you mean, once?

          MIKE
     When I was born.

          DENISE
     How could you remember when that
     god-awful thing happened?

          MIKE
     Dunno. But I remember it. how
     beautiful and kind she good. Yeah,
     I remember was. She was good

          DENISE
     And she split from you, huh?

          MIKE
     Maybe she didn't mean to.

          DENISE
     Did you see what was going on,
     Mike? Between Pinky and Dale? Did
     you see that? That's the third
     fight I've seen today. Things
     always happen in threes.

          MIKE
     I don't know. They have a sort of,
     ah, relationship. Between them.

Across the street there are three people, a TALL MAN, who has his
hat stuck on his boot and a lady and another man with a dog on a
leash.

          MIKE
     I don't know about that, but, ah,
     listen, what you and me talk
     about, it's just between us, you
     understand? Hey, what's over
     there, see those assholes? Who are
     they, you know any of them?

          DENISE
     I can't see that far

DENISE STANDS AND OPENS THE FRONT DOOR AND YELLS ACROSS THE
STREET.

          DENISE
     HEY!

The group across the street look up and begin yelling back, but
we cannot hear them.

Under the Burnside Bridge, day.

Mike and Denise kiss, and their arms are entangled in a loving,
but awkward embrace. Twigs and leaves are caught in Denise's hair
as they are lying on the ground.

Different STILL COMPOSITIONS OF SEX while they are lying in the
wilds under the bridge.

Then...

Denise lights a cigarette.

          DENISE
     That reminds me, I gotta send my
     Ma a Christmas card, I still
     haven't done it yet.

          MIKE
     Yeah, I haven't done it either.

          DENISE
     Your mom lives in Idaho right now?

          MIKE
     Yeah.

          DENISE
     I used to live in Montana.

          MIKE
     My own cousin. He's dead. that's
     one...two... And my grandma, it
     usually comes in threes.

          DENISE
     Does come in threes.

          MIKE
     My cousin died, my grandmother
     died, and right after she died,
     her daughter died. My aunt. Within
     a year. And they wuz all women,
     not even a year, six...well....
     six months-eight months, three
     women in the family died.

A pause.

          MIKE
     That's funny, huh? I WONDER WHY
     YOU THOUGHT THAT, cuz, my FATHER
     says stuff like that.

          DENISE
     Well, my grandma was
     superstitious.

          MIKE
     My father told me that, said
     things usually come in threes...
     and I said, .... you're crazy.

A Long pause. A motorcycle passes, someone yells, and a horn
honks.

          MIKE
     It sounds crazy. That's my lucky
     number too.

          DENISE
     Huh?

          MIKE
     Three.

          DENISE
     Mine's eight.

          MIKE
     I like three.

          DENISE
     You know why I like eight?

          MIKE
     Why?

          DENISE
     Cause of the eight ball. You know.
When you're stuck behind the eight
ball? I fuckin' feel stuck behind
the eight ball today, I'll tell

you. The business is so slow in the
middle of the week, you know that
Mike?

Public bathroom. Night.

Mike empties the contents of his pockets at a bathroom sink. He
has in his possession: One condom. One comb with blond hair stuck
in it. One nickel. Half a stick of gum. One knife with the letter
W stamped on it.

He arranges these things in a neat order on the surface of the
sink while a man flushes a toilet in the background and uses
another sink. Mike is quite at home here. He takes his time
arranging the articles, and washing his hands. He looks over at
the man washing his hands and gives him a friendly smile.

The man leaves. Mike puts all the things on the sink into his
pockets. Then he walks over to a urinal, unzips his fly and
starts to take a leak. A shadow opens the door in back of him,
and without turning around, Mike senses the presence of a man.

Alleyway. Night.

Scottie is helping Bob with a disguise, putting on pants over a
large belly, with medallions around the neck.

          SCOTT
     How long has it been, Bob, since
     you could see your own feet?

          BOB
     About four years, Scottie. Four
     years of grief. It blows a man up
     like a balloon.

Mike and Budd appear, running, with costumes on. There are two
others behind them.

          MIKE
     There's rock and roll money
     walking this way!

          BUDD
     And they're drunk as skunks.

          MIKE
     This is going to be easy. We can
     do it lying down.

          SCOTT
     But don't fall asleep, now, Mike.

          BUDD
     Shh! Here they come!

          SCOTT
     You four should head them off
     there!

          BOB
     We four? How many are walking with
     them?

          MIKE
     About six.

          BOB
     Huh, shouldn't they be robbing us?

Scottie laughs. Bob waddles along the side of the alleyway,
stepping on a curb, then in a pothole losing his balance. Another
accomplice whistles from atop a building. We SEE the group of
ROCK AND ROLL promoters.

Bob walks further from Mike and Scottie.

          SCOTTIE
     If they escape from you, we'll get
     them here.

Bob struggles as he walks.

          BOB
     Eight feet of cobblestones is like
     30 yards of flat road with me.

Mike and Scott run off, laughing at him.

          BOB
     I can't see a damned thing in
     here.

          BUDD
     Jesus, will you shut up! And keep
     on your toes!

Budd sees the promoters coming and waves to Bob as he lies down
on the ground.

          BUDD
     Lie down!!

          BOB
     Lie down!?

          BUDD
     Lie down and stay quiet, until
     they round the corner and we'll
     ambush them.

          BOB
     Have you got a crane to lift me up
     again?

Budd laughs.

          MIKE
     They're coming!!

Down the way, the rock and roll promoters are approaching, having
no knowledge of the buffoonery at the other end of the tunneling
alleyway. They are drunk.

          VICTIM 1
     Come along neighbor, Tommy will
     lead the way. I've lost track of
     time... (burp)

At the other end of the alley:

Bob and three others are marching in procession, chanting, a
facsimile of Rashneesh, but a bad act.

The rock promoters approach, smashing a bottle.

          VICTIM 1
     Who are these jokers?

          VICTIM 2
     Rashneesh, listen!

          VICTIM 1
     They're chanting....

Scottie and Mike hide behind garbage cans, laughing.

The rock promoters circle the group of chanting Rashneesh.

          VICTIM 3
     I thought that all you Rashneesh
     had up and left...

Victim 1 pours a beer on one of their heads. Just as he does this
Bob pulls out two long pistols, almost heavy enough that he
cannot hold them straight, barrels parallel.

          BOB
     Aha! One move and I'll blow you
     away, you sully scumbags, up
     against that wall!

One of the victims falls down and begins to run away. One of
Bob's men starts after him. A lockbox that he was carrying falls
to the ground. Bob spies it.

          BOB
     No! Let him go!

Bob aims one pistol at the running figure as he keeps the others
against the wall with the other pistol. He fires three times. One
of Bob's boys grabs the lockbox.

A VIEW of the running figure, bullets cutting around him.

          BOB
     Look at him go!

          VICTIM 2
     Don't shoot us!

Bob winks at the lockbox and shoots the gun in the air.

All the rock promoters go running. Bob charges after them, firing
the gun twice more in the air, then once at the lockbox, breaking
it open.

          BOB
     The valise is open. Let's see what
     we got.

Mike and Scottie hiding behind trashcans.

          SCOTTIE
     Where are our disguises?

Mike runs to his stash and finds two large capes and large hats.
They put these on.

Bob finds wads of money and receipts.

          BOB
     Ticket anyone? To next week's
     show?

He throws these on the ground and the boys fall over themselves
for the tickets. Bob wads the money and puts it back in the box,
laughing to himself.

Mike and Scottie sneak closer to the group still hiding, long
flowing capes concealing their identity.

          BOB
     Scott and Mike have disappeared,
     did the shots scare them away?

They sneak closer. Mike lights a big firecracker and waits.

          BOB
     ...maybe we should get the hell
     out of here. But, are they such
     chickens?

A LOUD EXPLOSION!

Mike and Scottie, disguised, jump out with large silver baseball
bats, swinging them and making as much noise as they can,
knocking over a set of garbage cans, flashing flashlights into
Bob and the others' eyes.

Frightened, Bob drops the lockbox and runs, the others follow,
Mike and Scottie hitting them with the bats as they go.

          BOB
     Get the box! Oh, Fuck!

Mike swings the bat at Bob, it grazes the side of a building and
sparks fly from it. Bob wheezes from the run.

Scottie chases the others in the same direction.

They stand, kicking garbage cans and watching them run,
convulsing with laughter.

          SCOTTIE
     The thieves scatter!

          MIKE
     Bob Pigeon will sweat to death!

Jack Favor enters the Governor's CHAMBERS day.

          JACK
     Can anyone tell me about my son?

He walks across the room.

          JACK
     It's been a full three months
     since I last saw him. Where is my
     son Scott?

          AID
     We don't know, sir.

          JACK
     Ask around in Old Town, in some of
     the taverns there. Some say he
     frequently is seen down there
     drinking with street denizens.
     Some who they say even rob our
     citizens and store owners. I can't
     believe that such an effeminate
     boy supports such 'friends.'

A high overhead (helicopter?) view of the country landscape in
the early morning. Far below us on a lonely road is a small dot,
a motorcycle, traveling east.

Further along on its travels, the motorcycle crosses a steel
BRIDGE.

Old Town day.
Scottie and Mike, riding on a stolen motorcycle, sweep through
the early morning streets without being noticed.

Stopping at a stop light in the city.

Scott pauses to think.

          SCOTT
     Mikey, do you realize how long I
     have been here out on the streets,
     on this crusade?

          MIKE
     About as long as the rest of us. I
     mean. I can't even remember that
     far back, Scott, I mean

          SCOTT
     It's been three years, Mike.

          MIKE
     Wow... that's a really long time,
     Scott. Have I been here three
     years, too?

          SCOTT
     What I'm getting at, Mike, is that
     we are survivors.

          MIKE
     Yeah, well, so, isn't that
     obvious?

          SCOTT
     Yes. It is incredibly obvious.
     They could drop a bomb on this
     city and you know what we would
     do?

          MIKE
     (thinking)
     DIE?

          SCOTT
     No. We would survive. Because we
     are...

          MIKE
     Survivors!

          SCOTT
     Right, Mike.

          MIKE
     Say, Scott. Whaddya say we go
     survive over at the Broadway Cafe
     a little bit, at least it's warm
     over there.

Int. Broadway Cafe. Day.

Mike and Scott sit around the table with Carl and Mary. Mike
blows a smoke ring.

Denise runs in the door of the cafe, excited about something.

          DENISE
     MIKE! Scottie! There's a man from
     City Hall down the street. He
     wants to speak with you, Scottie.

          SCOTT
     What's that?

          DENISE
     He says that he's sent by your
     father.

          SCOTT
     Say hello and send him to my
     mother.

          MIKE
     What kind of a man is it?

          DENISE
     A young man. And he's got cops
     with him.

          SCOTT
     Cops....

Street exterior day.

Two POLICEMEN and one OFFICIAL are walking down the street toward
the Broadway cafe.

Broadway Cafe interior day.

The cops enter, passing The PROPRIETOR of the cafe, an aging
heavyset woman named NANCY.

          NANCY
     Good morning, officers...

          COP 2
     How are you this morning, NANCY?
     Don't mind if we take a look
     around your place, do you?

One officer is already inspecting the stolen motorcycle outside.

Mike sees this, and looks the other way from the cop who is
peering in the Broadway cafe window.

          COP 1
     Have you seen the young Scott
     Favor?

          NANCY
     I do believe he was here just a
     second ago. Nancy looks in the
     front window.

          NANCY
     Oh, yeah, there he is.

Nancy points Scott out.

Scott is giving Denise a long kiss, hiding from the cops.  The
OFFICIAL walks to the front window of the Cafe.  Scott pretends
he is being rudely interrupted.

          SCOTT
     Ah-ha... what have we here?

          OFFICIAL
     Excuse me... Mr. Favor... we have
     been sent in search of a fat
     man... a large bearded....

          COP 1
     FAT MAN...

          COP 2
     Goes by Bob Pigeon.

          SCOTT
     Bob Pigeon?

          COP 1
     That's right.

          SCOTT
     What do you want with him?

          COP 2
     Ahem. There's been a report, sir,
     he has been involved in a
     holdup...

          COP 1
     Last night. Have you seen him?

          SCOTT
     I saw him around last night, when
     was the holdup?

          COP 1
     Late. Two in the morning.

          SCOTT
     I saw him about four, but he
     wasn't very loose with his wallet.
     Did he get away with any of the
     money?

          COP 2
     Yes, indeed, sir... two thousand
     dollars of a rock promoter's
     money.

          SCOTT
     Well, anyway, I haven't seen him
     recently. Why do you look here?

          COP 1

     They say he has friends here.

          SCOTTIE

     I beg your pardon.

          COP 2
     Sorry...

          OFFICIAL
     Sorry for the interruption. We
     have a message for you from your
     father. He says that he would like
     to see you as soon as possible.

THE OFFICIAL HANDS SCOTT AN ENVELOPE.

          SCOTT

     Thank you for your message.

Scott takes the envelope and puts it on the table.

street, day.

The police close the door.

          COP 1

     Hmmm.

          COP 2
     What about the dead body.

          COP 1
     Let's not get Favor's kid involved
     in this report if we can help it.
     But if he were my son, I'd....

Cop 1 makes a fist and slams It In the palm of his other hand.

INT. Broadway Cafe.

          MIKE
     Bob is a wanted man now.

          SCOTTIE
     And as dangerous to be around as
     cops themselves.

          MIKE
     We need a hiding place.

          SCOTTIE
     Where should we go?

          MIKE
     To visit my brother.

          SCOTT
     You have a brother?

          MIKE
     Yes, I have one.

          SCOTT
     Where is he?

          MIKE
     He's in     he's in

Mike suddenly begins to shake, and, falls asleep.

Scottie picks up the envelope from his father and puts it in his
pocket.

Mike and Scott are stuck on a long straight road in the desert.
Mike is angry at Scott because he doesn't think he knows how the
motorcycle works.

Scott is trying again and again to start the engine.

          MIKE
     Come on...

          SCOTT
     Shut up, Mike.

He tries to turn it over again.

          SCOTT
     If I had known that it was going
     to be this hard to start, then I
     wouldn't have stopped it at all.

Mike looks at the road and the surrounding area. It is the same
road that he was stuck on in the beginning.

          MIKE
     Scott? I just know that I have
     been on this road before.

Mike stares at the face in the road. Two cactus for eyes,
mountains for hair, a cloud shadow forms the mouth over a red
nose road with a dotted line running down it.

At night, Scott and Mike sit next to a fire they have made on the
side of the road.  We can hear Indians in the distance dancing
and chanting a song.

          MIKE
     It sure is lonely out in the
     desert.

          SCOTT
     Yeah, I guess.

          MIKE
     If I had had a normal family, and
     a good upbringing, then I would
     have been a well adjusted person.
     But somehow that just didn't work
     out.

          SCOTT
     Depends on what you'd call
     "normal. -

          MIKE
     Well, normal, you know, with a mom
     and a dad and a dog and shit like
     that... normal.

          SCOTT
     So you didn't have a dog?  Or you
     didn't have a dad...

          MIKE
     I didn't have a dog and I didn't
     have a dad. Well, not a normal
     dad...

The music is getting louder. It sounds like a war chant.

          MIKE
     Hey Scott?

          SCOTT
     What?

Mike is hesitating.  He is about to say something personal.  He
looks at Scott and back to the fire, a few times too many.

          SCOTT
     What, Mike?

          MIKE
     Oh.  Have you ever.  Uh...

Scott is getting Mike's drift. Mike rubs his crotch.

          MIKE
     I mean, don't you ever get horny?

          SCOTT
     Yeah.  But...

          MIKE
     Oh, yeah... not for a guy.

          SCOTT
     Mike.  Two guys can't love each
     other.  They can only be friends.

An awkward moment passes where Mike is looking away from Scott
and Scott can't help but look at Mike.  Then Scott catches Mike's
eye and motions for him to come closer to him.

Mike walks over to Scott and Scott holds him in his arms.

Overhead VIEW of the two in front of the campfire.

          SCOTT
     I only have sex for money.

Mike starts to get out some money.

          SCOTT
     I can't take your money.

A pause.

          SCOTT
     But we can be close friends.

The next morning. Mike is sleeping. As he opens his eyes, he can
see Scott still trying to start the motorcycle.

Mike stands and looks down the road at an approaching State
Police Car. Mike, afraid of the police, starts to move into the
bushes.

Scott is out of breath trying to start the bike.

          MIKE
     Scott, look...

Scott looks in the direction of the police car.

          SCOTT
     Looks like this is it.

          MIKE
     Yeah.

Scott hits the side of the gas tank of the bike with the palm of
his hand.

          SCOTT
     Can't get the bike started. Cops
     are coming. Stuck in the middle of
     nowhere with a stolen bike. Yeah,
     Mike. Looks like this is the end.

The policeman pulls up to them and parks.

The policeman sits in his car for a second and reports into the
radio, then he gets out and walks over to the boys.

Mike gets scared and runs into the desert.

The cop stands and watches. Mike has nowhere to go, he is running
into an open desert.

The policeman, a full blooded American Indian, seems amused at
his power. He looks at Scott then back at Mike, who trips in the
desert and falls in a cloud of dust.

          COP
     What's the matter with him?

          SCOTT
     I don't know. I guess he doesn't
     like cops.

          COP
     Yeah.

          SCOTT
     That's how it looks.

          COP
     What are you kids doing out here?

          SCOTT
     This cycle is one bitch to turn
     over. But you probably don't know
     about motorcycles. You aren't a
     motorcycle cop.

          COP
     I turned a few.

Scott walks through the desert looking for Mike where he dropped.
He picks him up out of the dirt, spit dripping from his sleeping
lips, and smacks him in the face.

          SCOTT
     Wake up, Mikey, the heat's off.

Mike will not wake up.

When Mike wakes up. He is inside a TRAILER at night.

Scott is eating sandwiches to his right that are on a little TV.
tray.

There is MIKE'S BROTHER leaning into him on his left. He looks at
Mike offensively. His brother is very good looking, but looks
like he has lost his mind somewhere down the line. Which is why
he lives in the desert in a trailer, away from people.

          SCOTT
     Look, Mike. Sandwiches.

          BROTHER
     Your mother... now she was a right
     woman. She used to be so proud of
     you... you know... she would just
     beam. And not Jim Beam either. If
     you know what I mean. We used to
     drive for hours to get a look at
     you. I remember, what was it...
     eighteen years ago?

          MIKE
     Twenty-one.

          BROTHER
     Is that how old you are now? I
     thought you wuz younger than
     that... what? Well anyway, we
     would start off in the morning to
     see you, and it would take an hour
     to get to the institution. You
     were maybe one year old. What?  I
     wasn't proud that you had to live
     in an institution, mind you... but
     all the same, when I would look at
     you, all the institutional walls
     would come down and we were a
     family. Your mom, me, and you. God
     knows where dad was.

Mike is getting visibly upset. Scott gets up to go to the
bathroom.

Inside the bathroom night.

Scott enters and notices a velvet portrait of a woman hanging on
the wall. Off screen Scott can hear Mike and his Brother.

          MIKE (o.s.)
     I don't belong to you, DUDE... I'm
     not yours...

          BROTHER (o.s.)
     (his voice booms out so
     unexpectedly deep and loud that
     Scott is startled) Shut your
     mouth! Don't you talk back...

His brother hits the table with a crash.

Living room night.

          BROTHER
     Well... (takes a breath )
     Anyway. You were maybe not in the
     biological sense, my brother, but in
     our business, ~..... (holds his
     hands up in the air) And If I'm not
     Your brother, how's come you turned
     out exactly like me then?

Mike has gotten the jitters and fallen asleep in front of him.

Scott enters from the bathroom.

          BROTHER
     Oh, he'll come out or it. It's
     like this whenever we get together
     It's always like this when we get
     together  It's the way that we say
     hello to each other.

He holds his head down.

          BROTHER
     I'm all that he's got. But he
     doesn't want me. He doesn't care.
     He'd rather live out on the
     streets. I love him, though.

Scott looks around the trailer at all the velvet portraits
hanging on the walls.

          BROTHER
     Oh. I paint these for a living.
     But sometimes the people don't
     send the check when they get
     finished. So I keep them. I like
     them.

Ext. Trailer. Night.

Mike and his brother sip iced tea. Colored lights decorate the
trailer.

          BROTHER
     Want me to tell you what happened
     to your Mom? Have you ever heard
     it? Did you ever hear what the
     hell happened to her?

          MIKE
     No. But I don't care.

          BROTHER
     You loved her, and don't tell know
     you did. me you didn't. I

          MIKE
     I didn't even know her.

          BROTHER
     Yeah, you loved her, though.

          MIKE
     I already heard what happened to
her.

          BROTHER
     But you don't know the whole
     story. One thing about the truth.
     It's interesting.

          MIKE
     I don't care.

          BROTHER
     If you had known her, you would
     care. She would see guys on the
     side. At night. When I wouldn't be
     around... maybe I'd be in San
     Francisco or some darned place,
     doing my own business. God knows
     where. She would see guys...
     yeah.... anyway   along comes this
     guy. A guy we both knew. A guy who
     was into cards. A gamblin' man.
     And he said that he used to herd
     cattle in Argentina. I dunno,
     maybe he did, and he had a bit of
     money. More'n I had at that point
     in time. But it was funny, the way
     he gambled. He was not safe in the
     friends that he made. So his money
     would come and go real fast....

          MIKE
     I never heard this one before.

          BROTHER
     So this guy, your Mom fell for.
     What? She went cuckoo over this
     guy. Well, their affair went on
     for a year or so and your mom
     wanted to marry this guy. She was
     already married to our real dad.
     So he said no. He didn't love her
     anyways. But she wanted him to
     marry her. And to have a little
     family. That's when you were born.
     As a matter of fact, you were
     really the cause of this whole
     mess. She wanted to make a little
     family and take you and this guy
     someplace and set something up.

(slaps his leg with his hand)

A family thing! Ridiculous, right. A
card man. Had a bunch of money, but
could have just as well lost it on
his next hand. Probably did too. Well
you'll see what I'm getting at.

          MIKE
     That's not how I heard it.

          BROTHER
     Yeah, I know. You heard it from me
     and I'm telling it different this
     time, see? So this Mom of yours
     found herself a fuckin' gun. I
     thought she was going to blow me
     away with it one night. She got so
     into this gun. She would flash it
     to anybody that gave her trouble.
     She would sleep with it. Yeah...
     strange, huh? She would stir fry
     vegetables with the loaded gun.
     What? I mean    What? I used to
     say, politely, "Mom, don't go
     stirring up dinner with the gun,
     now, you'll blow a hole in the
     frying pan." What?

Mike begins to cry.

          BROTHER
     And she used to do other things
     with this gun. Sexy things with
     it. Oh, boy, she was into this
     thing. I just thought it was some
     sort of weird phase that she was
     going through. And so anyway, this
     guy, who she was cuckoo over,
     brought her to the movies one
     night. A drive-in movie in a
     stolen car, don't-chaknow, what?
     And the movie was.... ah.... RIO
     BRAVO or some shit like that. And
     well, she went and shot this
     guy.... don't-cha-know.

          MIKE
     You're making this up as you go
     along, bro.

          BROTHER
     And they didn't find him until the
     next show, RIO BRAVO playing on
     the big screen. Spilled popcorn
     soaking up the blood.

Mike begins to really cry now, bawling and coughing.

          SCOTT
     (who has been listening)
     Oh, come on, how corny, man....

          BROTHER
     No. Your mom had to split, and
     split she did. And that guy. That
     guy was your real father.

          MIKE (sniffs)
     I knew that was coming. You sure
     do like to make me cry, bro.

          BROTHER
     And I got this card from her, not
     too awful long ago. Maybe a year.

Mike's Brother hands him a postcard with a Holiday Inn motel on
the front of it. Written on the card, Mike's mom says she is
working as a waitress there, in the "Blue Room" of the Holiday
Inn off Interstate 85 outside Boise, Idaho. He also hands him a
picture of his mom.

Mike and Scott wore sunglasses as they journeyed onward to the
Blue Room, Scott driving the motorcycle and Mike riding on the
back.

Night time exterior of the Holiday Inn.

Mike and Scott pull up on the motorcycle and park it.

Inside the Holiday Inn.

A hostess is standing in front of a sign that bills "Shecky
Crude" as the featured entertainer of the evening in the "Blue
Room."

Mike is speaking to the hostess. He shows her his picture of mom.

          MIKE
     My mother works here. Her name is
     Dorothy.

          HOSTESS
     (thinks for a second)
     No. I can't think of anyone by that
     name. Let me get the manager.

The hostess picks up the phone.

Manager's office night.

A MANAGER is sitting behind his desk wearing a shiny blue suit,
he shifts in his swiveling chair, and looks at the Holiday Inn
Postcard that Mike's mother sent to his father.

          MANAGER
     Dorothy, Dorothy   There was a
     Dorothy Biondi used to work here a
     year ago, but she split. Saved up
     all her money and headed to Italy.

          MIKE
     To Italy?

          MANAGER
     Yeah. It took her forever to save
     any cash, but she did, and flew
     away. She was looking for her
     family. I guess she came from
     Italy. But she didn't look
     Italian.

          SCOTT
     Was your mom Italian?

          MIKE
     I don't know.   I guess that she
     was.

In the lobby of the Holiday Inn at night.

Mike and Scott witness the arrival of the German Mercedes Benz
parts salesman.

          SCOTT
     There's that guy.

          MIKE
     Who?

          SCOTT
     The guy who gave us a ride from
     Portland. What's he doing here?

Scott and Mike walk up to him. HANS turns and a broad smile
crosses his face.

          HANS
     Mike! Scottie! How good to run
     into you! My dear boys! How have
     you been?

Inside Hans' hotel bathroom. Night.

Mike lies in a bathtub in sudsy water. There is a pounding on the
bathroom door.

          MIKE
     I just got in the tub! Wait your
     turn.

          HANS
     But Mike! Don't you want anything
     to eat? We are ordering room
     service. Ya?

          MIKE
     Ahhh.  Room service?  Ya!  Let me
     see. Two hamburgers, with cheese,
     onions, lettuce, tomato, no
     pickles. A Coke and french fries.

          HANS
     O.K. That's hamburger wiz
     everything, no pickles, Coke,
     french fries.

          MIKE
     That is correct.

          HANS
     Thank you.

          MIKE
     You're welcome.

As Mike and Scott eat their hamburgers, Hans sits across from
them next to a small desk light on a double bed in his Holiday
Inn room.

          HANS
     How are the hamburgers, boys?

          MIKE
     They're okay, Hans.

          SCOTT
     Good, Hans. I don't think that
     I've tasted a hamburger as fine as
     this Holiday Inn hamburger.

          HANS
     I'm glad that you like it.

The boys eat approvingly.

          HANS
     How did you boys get so far? I
     only left you in Portland a few
     days ago.

          SCOTT
     We rode on our trusty motorcycle.

          HANS
     And what brings you to the Holiday
     Inn?

          SCOTT
     Business.

          HANS
     What kind of business?

          SCOTT
     We're selling motorcycles.

Still images of Mike, Scott and Hans having sex in the motel.

Hans rides his newly purchased motorcycle across the plains from
Boise to Picabu, Idaho. A local policeman pulls him over doing 95
mph in a 45 mph zone.

At the Boise Airport Scott and Mike stand in a ticket line. The
ticket taker stamps their tickets.

          TICKET TAKER
     Do you have any baggage?

Mike and Scott shake their heads no.

ItaliA

Mike wakes up and finds himself sitting beside the Trevi fountain
in Rome. There are other street kids surrounding him fishing for
coins that tourists have thrown in the fountain. He doesn't see
Scott.
He looks around a bit.

          SCOTT (o.s.)
     Mikey! Over here!

Mike's VIEW of Scott in a taxi cab.

The TAXI pulls up to a small farmhouse on a hill outside of Rome.
Mike and Scott get out and walk around the house. A farmer is
cutting his crop on the next hillside.

A DOG walks up to them.

The taxi driver gets out of the car and asks for his money in
Italian. Scott holds out the money that he has and the driver
takes it, counting it out for himself.

Mike walks around a corner of the house and notices the doors are
open as the cab drives off down the drive.

Scott sits down on the stoop in front of a shack and Mike steps
into the house.

          MIKE
     Mom?............Hello?

An extremely Beautiful Italian girl walks around the corner where
Scott is sitting. He can't see her. And she leans against the
shack and stares at him, then looks up at Mike, who is walking
through the house trying to find someone.

          GIRL
     Hello.

          SCOTT
     Hi. Is this your house?

The girl is a little shy and leans on the shack.

          GIRL
     No. This isn't my house, but. It
     is my uncle's house.

          SCOTT
     I'm Scott.

          GIRL
     I'm Carmella.

          SCOTT
     And he is Mike. We came from
     America to find his mother.

          CARMELLA
     Oh. An American woman?

          SCOTT
     Yeah, do you know her?

          CARMELLA
     Yes, but. It is not true that she
     lives here..

          SCOTT
     It isn't true?

          CARMELLA
     No. She left a long time ago. Back
     to America.

          SCOTT
     Oh, shit.  Was she your friend?

          CARMELLA
     I wanted to speak English, and she
     taught it to me.

Scott looks up at her, a little surprised.

Mike walks from the house to Scott and Carmella.

          CARMELLA
     Hello. My name is Carmella.

          MIKE
     I'm Mike.

          CARMELLA
     Hello Mike.

          SCOTT
     She knows your mom.

Later in the afternoon, Mike is inside of a room in the house,
and he is crying. He is talking to Scottie, who is holding him.

          MIKE
     I mean, Christ, we come all this
     fuckin' way and she ain't here
     either. Where'd she go from here?

Mike walks through the rooms of the Italian country

MIKE'S VIEW of a room, and Scott is just closing the door. He
winks at Mike as he shuts it.

Inside the room, Carmella and Scott lay down on the bed and kiss.

Scott takes off his clothes and ravishes Carmella, tearing at her
dress.

Carmella is naked and the two grab and twist with each other on
the white bed.

Still views of the lovemaking.

Mike in the country, watching the farmer in the field.

Mike approaches the house and there is a taxi cab waiting.
Carmella is putting a suitcase in the trunk.

Scott helps Carmella in the front seat of the taxi.

          SCOTT
     Hey, Mike. Let me talk with you
     for a second.

Scott follows Mike inside the house and into a room.

          SCOTT
     I'm gonna take some time off.

Scott gives Mike an American Express card.

          SCOTT
     Don't leave home without it. Ha-
     ha. (Mike doesn't think it's
     funny)
     I mean, maybe I'll run into you
down      the road.

Mike is shocked but sees what Scott needs to do as he looks out
the window and can see Carmella in the taxi.

          MIKE
     Yeah, sure. Okay.

          SCOTT
     Sorry about this, dude.

          MIKE
     I'll be okay. Don't worry about
     me.

          SCOTT
     Sorry, but....

          MIKE
     No, man, forget it. Hurry up,
     she's waiting, you're gonna lose
     her.

Mike hides a tear.

          SCOTT
     All right. You sure you'll be
     okay?

          MIKE
     Go on, get out of here.

Outside, a dog watches the taxi leave down a rutted dirt drive.

          MIKE'S THOUGHTS:
     Well. So much for the great
     protector-of-us-all. Protector of
     himself, more like. I couldn't
     believe Scott would leave me here
     in the middle of a foreign
     country.

Inside, Mike goes into one of his fits, snorting, a little like a
pig, and falls asleep.

PoRtland

Mike wakes up in an airline's passenger seat. A STEWARDESS is
leaning over him.

          STEWARDESS
     Wake up. Wake up, we're here.

          MIKE
     Where? Where am I?

          STEWARDESS
     You're in Portland.

INT. BROADWAY CAFE in the day.

Mike sits at the round table in front of the window.

Denise is with a new boy, STUART, and they are making out.  Mary
sits and chain smokes cigarettes, there are three other UNKNOWNS
around the table.

          MIKE
     And so, I was back in Portland,
     enjoying the life I used to lead.
     It was like I was back from a
     vacation. Denise had a boyfriend
     now....

Ext. street night.

Cars cruise by. Mike is on a street corner. He hops into a
stranger's car.

Int. MOTEL night.

Still views of Mike having sex with a date.

          MIKE
     ... and I enjoyed the fruits of my
     labor.

CLOSE VIEW of money exchanging hands.

BROADWAY CAFE day.

Mike is at the table again, smoking a cigarette.

There are three new kids who look very MEAN, and are hassling
another kid, pulling his collar and throwing him around.

          MIKE'S THOUGHTS
     And there were new kids who were
     coming around who wanted to take
     your money. It was a dark period
     for the streets. Normally, Scott
     would keep order In the Broadway
     Cafe.

A Hot dog stand. Gary cheerfully prepares Mike a hot dog.

          MIKE'S THOUGHTS
     Gary and Ray both got work at
     stands. It was funny...

Int. Deli day.

Ray serves Mike a hot dog.

          MIKE'S THOUGHTS
     ( they both sold hot dogs. Which
     is what they were used to selling
     on the streets in the old days.
     These guys had really changed, I
     thought.

Mike's FACE, outdoors in the daytime.

He looks out on the cityscape.

The buildings of the city uproot and tumble in the air.

Jakes restaurant night.

Mike wakes up.  He is sitting next to Bob and Budd. A new friend,
a colorfully dressed man named BAD GEORGE, who looks like a
street minstrel, talks on the street in front of a fancy
restaurant.  Bad George is obnoxiously yelling in Bob's face.

          BAD GEORGE
     Bob! What tidings I bring you. And
     such joy. Some of that old rot gut
     that you and I used to drink. I
     have three bottles stashed in the
     bushes out on eighty-second.

          BOB
     What blew you in?

          BAD GEORGE
     Think of the fun we can have, if
     we could only rind a ride for a
     journey to the bushes where the
     hooch is hid.

          BOB
     If I shared your wine, I might
     catch this awful disease you
     appear to have. My clothes would
     turn striped, and I would suddenly
     have bells on my toes, like this
     here...

Bob points to George's bells on his shoes.

          BAD GEORGE
     Bob, you're one of the greatest
     living men on Three-street.

          BOB
     That is correct.

          BAD GEORGE
     Surely you can find us a ride
     somewhere.

          MIKE'S THOUGHTS:
     As I listened to Bad George and
     Bob talk, I watched across the
     street as a long black car pulled
     up alongside one of the fancier
     restaurant/bar establishments of
     Portland. And who got out of that
     car? It was the old protector-of-
     us-all, himself Scottie Favor.

Bob notices the group of men getting out of a car in front of the
restaurant. One of them is Scottie , in a three pieced suit. He
is with his Italian girlfriend.

          BOB
     If it isn't Scottie Favor himself.
     Blessed are they who have been my
     close friends. Now dressed in a
     three pieced suit and looking
     every bit a gentleman! He has run
     into his inheritance.

          BAD GEORGE
     Who?

          BOB
     George, Budd, Mike. We have waited
     for this day to come.

Bob charges in the direction of Scottie and his friends.

I nt. Jakes. Night.

Scottie and his associates, who are men much older than he,
perhaps in their thirties, make their way through the yuppie
crowd standing in the bar drinking. Hellos and how-do-you-do's
are directed at Scottie. A man stops Scott on his way through the
crowd.

          MAN
     Scottie! I haven't seen you in a
     dog's age. You're looking well. So
     grown up. Scottie, I'd like you to
     meet Ed Warren, he's in marketing
     at Nike. Ed, this is Scottie
     Favor.

          ED
     Oh, Jack Favor's son, hello,
     pleased to meet you.

          SCOTTIE
     How do you do?

Bob is following Scottie through the crowd. Scottie walks past
Hans, who is having a drink with another man. They recognize each
other but neither speak.

Bob, with Bad George in tow, straightens himself up as the yuppie
crowd looks on disapprovingly. Their smelly clothing betrays
them.

          BOB
     Come, George, watch this. You will
     see the attention that I get.

Bob looks at his clothes. A bouncer spots them.

          BOB
     It's true we're drawing attention
     to ourselves. But Scottie will see
     that I am dying to see him, and it
     won't matter how we're dressed.

Scotty and his friends are sitting around a crowded table. As
they take their seats, Scottie hears Bob bellowing.

VIEW of Bob being detained by the bouncer.

          BOB
     God save you! God save you, my
     sweet boy.

Scotty turns away from Bob, so his back is to him.

          BOB
     Sonny! My true friend!

Silence for a second, the crowd grows quieter.

          BOB
     I mean you, Sonny! It's me, Bob!

Without turning toward Bob, Scottie speaks.

          SCOTT
     I don't know you, old man.

          GIRL IN CROWD
     Who is that bum?

Scottie turns and meets Bob, who kneels next to him.

          SCOTTIE
     Please leave me alone.

Bob is thinking that Scottie's attitude is a joke.

          SCOTTIE
     Don't think that I'm the same
     Scottie that I was before.
     Everyone has noticed that I have
     turned away from that life, and
     the people who kept me company.

Bob is shocked.

Outside, Mike can see through the windows of the restaurant, Bob
and Scottie talking.

Int. Jakes. night.

          SCOTTIE
     When I was young, and you were my
     street tutor. An instigator for my
     bad behavior, I was trying to
     change. Now that I have, and until
     I change back   don't come near
     me.

Bob feels the rejection like a shock. Stares at Scott for a
second, then he's pulled away by the bouncer.

Ext. Jakes. night.

Mike watches Bob and Budd sit down with him.

          BUDD
     Don't take all this seriously.
     It's one of his jokes.

Nighttime overhead view of Bob in his greasy derelict hotel bed.
He is having nightmares, and suddenly he CRIES OUT'

          BOB
     God, God.... God!

Dawn views of the city

Mike awakes atop a downtown building.

Inside the Derelict Hotel Day.

Mike enters, and walks through a very quiet, although crowded
MAIN ENTRANCE. There is a body on a slab in the middle of the
room that is covered with a sheet.

          MIKE
     Pigeon?

          A BOY
     Scottie Favor broke his heart.

          GARY
     He's gone now, either to Heaven or
to Hell.

          JANE LIGHTWORK
     Be sure it isn't to Hell. He tried
     to be an honest sort. I'm the one
     who heard him cry out last night.
     He said God, God, God... three or
     four times. And when I got there I
     put my hand into the bed and felt
     his feet. And they were cold as
     stone. And I checked the rest of
     his body. And it too was as cold
     as stone.

          BUDD
     (crying)
     It sure is quiet.

Mike approaches Budd.

          MIKE
     I guess you're gonna miss him the
     most, Budd.

Mike gives him Scottie's American Express card, as others carry
his body out of the hotel.
Dawn views of the city.

          MIKE
     Here. Maybe you can give him a
     good burial.

Budd cries.

Mike exits.

In the country, Mike looks at the road.

He has visions of sagebrush and rock flying into the air as if
picked up by a big wind.

Then he lies asleep by the side of the road.

          MIKE'S VOICE
     I suppose that a lot of kids like
     me think that they have no home,
     that home is a place where you
     have a mom and a dad.

Pause.

          MIKE'S THOUGHTS
     But home can be any place that you
     want. Or wherever you can find
     My home is right here on the side
     of this road, that I been to
     before. I just know I been on this
     fucking road one time before, you
     know that?

Later, a car drives by Mike's sleeping body by the side of the
road. It turns around and stops next to Mike. A figure puts Mike
in his car and drives off down the road.

          MIKE'S THOUGHTS
     Sometimes I had thought that God
     had not smiled on me, and had
     given me a bum deal. And other
     times, I had thought that God had
     smiled on me. Like now. He was
     smiling on me... for the time
     being....

Int. Car. Day.

Scott is driving the car. He looks over at Mike sleeping.

Ext. Desert. Day.

The car disappears down the road.
