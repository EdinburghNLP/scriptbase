After the death of his wife Irena (Simone Simon), Oliver Reed (Kent Smith) has married former co-worker Alice Moore (Jane Randolph), and they now have a six-year-old introverted daughter, Amy (Ann Carter).
Amy has trouble at school because she spends too much time daydreaming, no matter how much Oliver tries to encourage her to make friends and cope with reality.
After Amy finds a photo of the deceased Irena, whose name is never mentioned in the house, Irena appears to her and the two strike up a friendship.
At the same time, Amy befriends Julia Farren, an aging actress who is alienated from her own daughter Barbara (Elizabeth Russell), whom she suspects to be a "spy" only pretending to be her relative.
Oliver, angry at Amy for repeatedly speaking of her new imaginary friend, punishes her.
When Irena announces to Amy that she must leave her, Amy runs out of the house.
A snow storm comes up, and Amy seeks shelter in the Farrens' house.
Barbara, mad and jealous at her mother's preference for Amy over her, intends to strangle the girl.
At this moment, Amy sees Irena's features in Barbara and embraces her.
Barbara, perplexed by this gesture of affection, spares her life.
Oliver arrives at the house and takes Amy home, promising to accept her fantasies.
