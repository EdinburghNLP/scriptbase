                                Trainspotting

                                Screenplay by

                                 John Hodge

                            Based on the Novel by

                                Irvine Welsh

                                 Directed by

                                 Danny Boyle

<b>----------------------------------------------------------------------------
</b>
<b>EXT. STREET. DAY
</b>
Legs run along the pavement. They are Mark Renton's.

Just ahead of him is Spud. They are both belting along.

As they travel, various objects (pens, tapes, CDs, toiletries, ties,
sunglasses, etc.) either fall or are discarded from inside their jackets.

They are pursued by two hard-looking Store Detectives in identical uniforms.
The men are fast, but Renton and Spud maintain their lead.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>                                (voice-over)

     Choose life. Choose a job. Choose a career. Choose a family,
     Choose a fucking big television, Choose washing machines, cars,
     compact disc players, and electrical tin openers.

Suddenly, as Renton crosses a road, a car skids to a halt, inches from him.

In a moment of detachment he stops and looks at the shocked driver, then at
Spud, who has continued running, then at the Two Men, who are now closing in
on him.

He smiles.

<b>INT. SWANNEY'S FLAT ROOM. DAY
</b>
In a bare, dingy room, Renton lies on the floor, alone, motionless and
drugged.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>                                    (v.o)

     Choose good health, low cholesterol and dental insurance. Choose
     fixed-interest mortgage repayments. Choose a starter home. Choose
     your friends.

<b>EXT. FOOTBALL PITCH. NIGHT
</b>
On a flood lit five-a-side pitch, Renton and his friends are taking on
another team at football.

The opposition all wear an identical strip (Arsenal), whereas Renton and his
friends wear an odd assortment of gear.

Three girls -- Lizzy, Gail, and Allison and Baby -- stand by the side,
watching.

The boys are outclassed by the team with the strip but play much dirtier.

As each performs a characteristic bit of play, the play freezes and their
name is visible, printed or written on some item of clothing. (T-Shirt,
baseball cap, shorts, trainers). In Begbie's case, his name appears as a
tatoo on his arm.

Sick Boy commits a sneaky foul and indignantly denies it.

Begbie commits an obvious foul and make no effort to deny it.

Spud, in goal, lets the ball in between his legs.

Tommy kicks the ball as hard as he can.

Renton's litany continues over the action:

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>                                    (v.o)

     Choose leisure wear and matching luggage. Choose a three piece
     suite on hire purchase in a range of fucking fabrics. Choose DIY
     and wondering who you are on a Sunday morning. Choose sitting on
     that couch watching mind-numbing sprit-crushing game shows,
     stuffing fucking junk food into your mouth. Choose rotting away at
     the end of it all, pishing you last in a miserable home, nothing
     more than an embarrassment to the selfish, fucked-up brats you
     have spawned to replace yourself. Choose your future. Choose life.

Renton is hit straight in the face by the ball. He lies back on the
astroturf. Voice-over continues.

     But who would I want to do a thing like that?

<b>INT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. DAY
</b>
Renton lies on the floor.

Swanney, Allison and Baby, Sick Boy and Spud are shooting up or preparing to
shoot up. Sick Boy is talking to Allison as he taps up a vein on her arm.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>                                    (v.o)

     I chose not to choose life: I chose something else. And the
     reasons? There are no reasons. Who need reasons when you've got
     heroin?

<b>                                  SICK BOY
</b>
     Goldfinger's better than Dr. No. Both of them are a lot better
     than Diamonds are Forever a judgement reflected in its relative
     poor showing at the box office, in which field, of course,
     Thunderball was a notable success.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>                                    (v.o)

     People think it's all about misery and desperation and death and
     all that shite, which is not to be ignored, but what they forget -

Spud is shooting up

     is the pleasure of it. Otherwise we wouldn't do it. After all,
     we're not fucking stupid. At least, we're not that fucking stupid.
     Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and
     you're still nowhere near it. When you're on junk you have only
     one worry: scoring. When you're off it you are suddenly obliged to
     worry about all sorts of other shite. Got no money: can't get
     pished. Got money: drinking too much. Can't get a bird: no chance
     of a ride. Got a bird: too much hassle. You have to worry about
     bills, about food, about some football team that never fucking
     winds, about human relationships and all the things that really
     don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit.

<b>                                  SICK BOY

     I would say, in those days, he was a muscular actor, in every
     sense, with all the presence of someone like Cooper or Lancaster,
     but combined with a sly wit to make him a formidable romantic
     lead, closer in that respect to Cary Grant.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>                                    (v.o)

     The only drawback, or at least the principal drawback, is that you
     have to endure all manner of cunts telling you that -

<b>INT. PUB I. NIGHT
</b>
Begbie, smoking and drinking, speaks to camera.

<b>                                   BEGBIE
</b>
     No way would I poison my body with that shite, all they fucking
     chemicals, no fucking way.

<b>INT. PUB I. NIGHT
</b>
Tommy sits beside Lizzy. He speaks to camera.

<b>                                    TOMMY
</b>
     It's a waste of your life, Rents, poisoning your body with that
     shite.

<b>INT. RENTON FAMILY HOME, LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
</b>
Renton's father and mother sit at the table eating.

Renton is seated but not eating.

<b>                                   FATHER
</b>
     Every chance you've ever had, you've blown it, stuffing your veins
     with that filth.

<b>INT. ELECTRICAL RETAILERS. DAY
</b>
Gav wears the corporate jacket.

<b>                                     GAV

     Get off that stuff, Rents and get a job. It's not as bad as it
     looks. While you're here, you don't fancy buying a cooker, do you?

<b>--------
</b>
<b>INT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. DAY
</b>
Sick Boy and Spud lie drugged up. Allison and Baby wait while Swanney cooks
up.

Renton is standing up.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>                                    (v.o)

     From time to time, even I have uttered the magic words.

<b>                                   SWANNEY
</b>
     Are you serious?

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.

<b>                                   SWANNEY
</b>
     Well, it's up to you.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     I'm going to get it right this time. Going to get it set up and
     get off it for good.

<b>                                   SWANNEY
</b>
     Sure, sure. I've heard it before.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     The Sick Boy method.

They both look at Sick Boy

<b>                                   SWANNEY
</b>
     Yeah, well, it surely worked for him.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     He's always been lacking in moral fibre.

<b>                                   SWANNEY
</b>
     He knows a lot about Sean Connery.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     That's hardly a substitute.

<b>                                   SWANNEY
</b>
     you'll need one more hit.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     No, I don't think so.

<b>                                   SWANNEY
</b>
     To see you through the night that lies ahead.

Freeze Frame on Swanney.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>                                    (v.o)

     We called him the mother superior on account of the length of his
     habit. He knew all about it. On it, off it, he knew it all. Of
     course I'd have another shot: after all, I had work to do.

<b>INT. RENTON'S FLAT ROOM. DAY
</b>
The door opens and Renton enters carrying shopping bags. He empties them on
to a mattress beside three buckets and a television.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>                                    (v.o)

     Relinquishing junk. Stage One: preparation. For this you will
     need: one room which you will not leave; one mattress; tomato
     soup, ten tins of; mushroom soup, eight tins of, for consumption
     cold; ice cream, vanilla, one large tub of; Magnesia, Milk of, one
     bottle; paracetamol; mouth wash; vitamins; mineral water;
     Lucozade; pornography; one bucket for urine, one for feces, and
     one for vomitus; one television; and one bottle of Valium, which I
     have already procured, from my mother, who is, in her own domestic
     and socially acceptable way, also a drug addict.

Renton swallows several Valium tablets. Voice-over continues.

     And now I'm ready. All I need is a final hit to soothe the pain
     while the Valium takes effect.

<b>INT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. DAY
</b>
Swanney, Sick Boy, Spud and Allison and Baby all lie inert while the
telephone rings.

<b>--------
</b>
<b>INT. CALL BOX. DAY
</b>
Renton curses as he slams down the receiver. He dials again.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     Mikey. It's Mark Renton. Can you help me out?

<b>INT. MIKEY'S FLAT. DAY

Renton holds two opium suppositories in the palm of his hand.

     This was typical of Mikey Forrester.

     What the fuck are these?

                                    (v.o)

     Under the normal run of things I would have had nothing to do with
     the cunt, but this was not the normal run of things.

     Opium suppositories. Ideal for your purpose. Slow release, like.
     Bring you down gradually. Custom fucking designed for your needs.

     I want a fucking hit.

<b>                                    MIKEY
</b>
     That's all I've got: take it or leave it.

Renton sticks his hand down the back of his trousers and sticks the
suppositories into his rectum.

     Feel better now?

<b>                                   RENTON

     For all the good they've done me I might as well have stuck them
     up my arse.

He smiles.

     Heroin makes you constipated. The heroin from my last hit is
     fading away and the suppositories have yet to melt. I am no longer
     constipated.

He looks around the local amenities. He is in discomfort, clutching his
abdomen and falling to his knees.

He notices a betting shop.

<b>INT. BETTING SHOP. DAY
</b>
Renton walks through the crowded, smoky betting shop towards a door marked
'toilet' with a bit of card.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>                                    (v.o)

     I fantasize about massive pristine convenience.

He stumbles through.

                                    (v.o)

     Brilliant gold taps, virginal white marble, a seat carved from
     ebony, a cistern full of Chanel No. 5, and a flunky handing me
     pieces of raw silk toilet roll. But under the circumstances I'll
     settle for anywhere.

<b>INT. HORRIBLE TOILET. DAY
</b>
This is the most horrible toilet in Britain.

Alone, Renton makes his way through the horrors to a cubicle.

<b>INT. HORRIBLE TOILET CUBICLE. DAY
</b>
Renton locks the door.

He looks into the bowl and winces with disgust, even in his state.

He pulls the chain. The chain comes off.

He drops his trousers, sits on the bowl and closes his eyes.

<b>MONTAGE

A lorry on a building site dumps a load of bricks, B52's shed their load on
Vietnam, the Blue Peter elephant, etc.

</b>
<b>INT. CUBICLE. DAY
</b>
Renton has his eyes closed. They snap open.

He looks down between his legs.

He drops to his knees in front of the bowl and rolls his sleeve up.

With no more hesitation he plunges his arm into the bowl and trawls for the
suppositories.

It seems to take ages. He cannot find them. He sticks his arm further and
further into the toilet, moving his whole body close. He strains to find it.

His head is over the bowl now. Gradually he reaches still further until his
head is lowered into the bowl, followed by his neck, torso, other arm, and
finally his legs, all disappearing.

The cubicle is empty.

<b>INT. UNDER WATER. DAY
</b>
Renton, dressed as before, swims through murky depths until he reaches the
bottom, where he picks up the suppositories, which glow like luminous
pearls, before heading up towards the surface again.

<b>INT. HORRIBLE TOILET CUBICLE. DAY
</b>
The toilet is empty.

Suddenly Renton appears through the bowl, then his arms as he lifts himself
out. Still clasping his two suppositories, he walks out of the toilet.

<b>INT. RENTON'S ROOM. DAY
</b>
The mattress, buckets and supplies are laid out as before.

The door opens and Renton enters, still soaking and dripping.

The suppositories are in his hand. He holds them up, and they twinkle in the
light.

</b>
     Now. Now I'm ready.

The cans of soup, the bottle of water, and the carton of ice cream are
empty, the bottle of pills spilt, the magazines well thumbed.

Renton cannot be bothered to pick it up.

<b>EXT. PARK. DAY
</b>
Typical weather, neither good nor bad. The park is nondescript arid green
with a few bushes. This is not Kew Gardens. Renton and Sick Boy appear,
dressed as before but for the addition of cheap sunglasses.

Renton is carrying a battered old cassette player and a carry-out in a
plastic bag.

Sick Boy is carrying a small, tatty suitcase from Oxfam.

They scan the horizon and give each other the nod. They walk towards the
bushes.

     The down side of coming off junk was that I knew I would need to
     mix with my friends again in a state of full consciousness. It was
     awful: they reminded me so much of myself I could hardly bear to
     look at them. Take Sick Boy, for instance, he came off junk at the
     same time as me, not because he wanted too, you understand, but
     just to annoy me, just to show me how easily he could do it,
     thereby downgrading my own struggle. Sneaky fucker, don't you
     think? And when all I wanted to do was lie along and feel sorry
     for myself, he insisted on telling me once again about his
     unifying theory of life.

     sniff it, smoke it, swallow it, stick it up my arse and inject it
     into my veins. I've been trying to combat this addiction, but
     unless you count social security scams and shoplifting, I haven't

     this together, and I wanted to put across the general idea rather
     than the details, yeah? People get all hung up on details, but
     what's the point? Like which school? Does it matter? Why? When?
     Where? Or how many O grades did I get? Could be six, could be one,

<b>INT. PUB 2. NIGHT
</b>
It is Saturday night in a busy, city-centre pub on two levels. On a large
upper balcony, overlooking the bar and floor downstairs, sit Spud, Gail,
Renton, Sick Boy, Tommy, Lizzy and Begbie.

Begbie's story overlaps with the subsequent depiction of the incident.

<b>                                   BEGBIE

     Picture the scene. Wednesday morning in the Volley. Me and Tommy
     are playing pool. No problems, and I'm playing like Paul fucking
     Newman by the way. I'm giving the boy here the tanning of a
     lifetime. So anyway, it comes to the final ball, the deciding shot
     of the tournament: I'm on the black and he's sitting in the
     corner, looking all biscuit-arsed. Then this hard cunt comes in.
     Obviously fancied himself. Starts looking at me. Right fucking at
     me. Trying to put off, like, just for kicks. Looking at me as if
     to say, 'Come ahead, square go.' Well, you know me, I'm no looking
     for trouble but at the end of the day I'm the cunt with the pool
     cue and I'm game for a swedge. So I squared up, casual like. So
     what does the hard cunt do, or so-called hard cunt? Shites it.
     Puts down his drink, turns around and gets the fuck out of there.
     And after that, the game was mine.

<b>INT. POOL HALL. DAY
</b>
The events in the pool hall, as described by Begbie.

Begbie and Tommy are playing pool.

Begbie is playing like a wizard.

Tommy looks defeated.

Lining up for the final ball, Begbie is distracted by a large Hard Man
standing at the bar staring at him.

Begbie stands up and walks slowly towards the Hard Man.

They stand, eye to eye, for a moment.

Begbie swings the pool cue slowly into his palm.

The Hard Man turns and leaves.

Begbie drinks the Hard Man's pint, then pots the black with a brilliant
shot.

<b>INT. PUB 2. DAY
</b>
Begbie, his story complete, finishes his pint. The others continue to stare
at him, frozen as though expecting something more. Begbie smiles and throws
the pint over his head.

Freeze-frame: the glass in mid-air and Begbie's smiling face.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>                                    (v.o)

     And that was it. That was Begbie's story. Or at least that was
     Begbie's version of the story. But a couple of days later I got
     the truth from Tommy. It was one of his major weaknesses: he never
     told lies, never took drugs, and never cheated on anyone.

<b>INT. TOMMY'S FLAT. DAY
</b>
Renton's hand flicks through a long row of videos on the floor while the
sound of weights being lifted (by Tommy) emanates from nearby.

Most of the videos are feature films or comedy shows, some with titles
written in Tommy's hand, but two catch Renton's attention.

They are 100 Great Goals and Tommy and Lizzy Vol. 1, the latter a
handwritten title.

Renton looks from the video round to Tommy, who is engrossed in lifting
weights.

<b>                                    TOMMY
</b>
     Well, sure it was Wednesday morning, we were in the Volley playing
     pool, that much is true.

Tommy's account over a depiction of his version.

     But Begbie is playing absolutely fucking gash. He's got a hangover
     so bad he can hardly hold the fucking cue, never mind pot the
     ball. I'm doing my best to lose, trying to humour him, like, but
     it's not doing any good: every time I touch the ball I pot
     something, every time Begbie goes near the table he fucks it up.
     So he's got the hump, right, but finally I manage to set it up so
     all he's go to do is pot the black to win one game and salvage a
     little pride and maybe not kick my head in, right. So he's on the
     black, pressure shot, and it all goes wrong, big time. What does
     he do? Picks on this specky wee gadge at the bar and accuses him
     of putting him off by looking at him. Can you believe it? I mean,
     the poor cunt hasn't even glanced in our direction. He's sitting
     there quiet as a mouse when Beggars gubs him with the cue. He was
     going to chib him, I tell you, then I thought he was going to do
     me. The Beggar is fucking psycho, but he's a mate, you know, so
     what can you do?

The events are as follows:

Begbie and Tommy are playing pool.

Begbie, furious, miscues, goes in off, etc.

Tommy deliberately misses sitters and tries to look annoyed.

Begbie lines up to play the black. It is unmissable.

At the bar beyond sits a harmless young Man, wearing the same clothes as the
Hard Man in Begbie's account except that they are now baggy rather than
taut. He is clearly not staring at Begbie but drinks a half-pint and eats
some crisps.

As Begbie plays, the Man bites a crisp.

Begbie miscues, rips the cloth and the ball flies off the table.

Tommy catches it and looks up to see Begbie assaulting the young Man.

Tommy cautiously restrains Begbie and he reaches into his jacket for a
knife.

Begbie turns and for a moment looks as though he might attack Tommy.

<b>INT. TOMMY'S FLAT. DAY

Tommy puts down his weights.

Renton holds up 100 Great Goals.

<b>                                   RENTON

     Can I borrow this one?

The freeze-frame of the glass in mid-air and Begbie's smiling face.

</b>                                    (v.o)

     Yeah, the guy's a psycho, but it's true, he's a mate as well, so
     what can you do? Just stand back and watch and try not to get
     involved. Begbie didn't do drugs either, he just did people. That
     what he got off on: his own sensory addiction.

The glass falls into the crowd.

Screaming starts. A Woman is bleeding from a wound in her head. The Men
beside her turn furiously around to look for the source of the glass.

Up on the balcony, Begbie stands up. The screams and shouting continue
below.

Begbie appears at the bottom of the staircase down from the balcony.

He strides towards the bleeding Woman and begins shouting.

<b>                                   BEGBIE
</b>
     All right. Nobody move. The girl got glassed and no cunt leaves
     here until we find out which cunt did it.

A man stands up from one of the tables.

<b>                                     MAN
</b>
     And who the fuck do you think you are?

Begbie kick the Man in the groin. Another moves towards him but is blocked
by the Men surrounding the girl. Soon the whole mass dissolves into a brutal
scrum, in which Begbie plays a prominent part.

Up on the balcony, the rest of the gang watch in silence.

<b>INT. RENTON'S FLAT. DAY
</b>
The empty cover for 100 Great Goals lies on the floor.

Sick Boy and Renton sit dispassionately watching Tommy and Lizzy in their
home-made soft-porn video.

<b>                                   RENTON

     And as I sat watching the intimate and highly personal video,
     stolen only hours earlier from one of my best friends, I realized
     that something important was missing from my life.

<b>INT. CLUB. NIGHT
</b>
A mass of dancing bodies fills the floor. The music is very loud.

At the side of the dance floor sit Tommy and Spud. The look rather gloomy.
There is an empty seat beside each of them. Spud is drinking heavily.

Tommy turns and speaks to Spud. His lips move but nothing is audible. Spud
is not ever aware that Tommy has spoken.

Tommy bellows in Spud's ear.

Tommy's words and all subsequent conversation in the dance area of the club
appear as subtitles, the character's communications somewhere between speech
and mime.

<b>                                    TOMMY

Standing nearby but apart from them is Renton.

Renton notes Spud and Tommy with their partners, and across the other side
Sick Boy and Begbie are engaged in flirtatious conversation with Two Women.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>                                    (v.o)

     The situation was becoming serious. Young Renton noticed the haste
     with which the successful, in the sexual sphere as in all others,
     egregated themselves from the failures.

Begbie and Sick Boy with the Two Women.

Renton standing among a group of lone nerds.

Renton wades on to the dance floor, looking at countless women, all whom
either turn away or are spoken for.

</b>                                    (v.o)

     Heroin had robbed Renton of his sex drive, but now it returned
     with a vengeance. And as the impotence of those days faded into
     memory, grim desperation took hold in his sex-crazed mind. His
     post-junk libido, fuelled by alcohol and amphetamine, taunted him
     remorselessly with his own unsatisfied desire dot.

Renton notices one girl (Diane) walking on her own towards the door.

A Man carrying two drinks catches up with her and walks backwards, talking
to her.

She says nothing. He blocks her way.

She takes one drink and downs it, then the other, handing him back the empty
glasses. She steps past him and walks on towards the door.

                                    (v.o)

     And with that, Mark Renton had fallen in love.

     Do you find that this approach usually works, or, let me guess,

     type but if I'm prepared to take a chance I might just get to know

     Our relationship is not being redefined; it is developing in an

<b>INT. DIANE'S HOME, LIVING-ROOM. MORNING
</b>
Renton lies submerged under a blanket.

The sounds of a normal morning travel from a room nearby: whistles, radio,
voices.

Renton peeps over the edge of the blanket, then covers his head again.

<b>INT. GAIL'S BEDROOM. MORNING
</b>
Spud opens his eyes. With his fingers, he feels crusted liquid around his
mouth.

Abruptly he turns around: the bed is soaked in vomit.

He looks under the cover and drops it again in revulsion.

<b>INT. DIANE'S HOME, LIVING-ROOM. DAY
</b>
Renton pulls himself up off the sofa and dresses as quickly as possible.

<b>INT. GAIL'S BEDROOM. DAY
</b>
Spud wipes the vomit from his chest with a pillowcase, which he dumps in the
middle of the sheets before gathering the whole lot up as a bundle.

<b>INT. DIANE'S HOME, HALL/KITCHEN. DAY
</b>
The door swings open. A Man and a Woman, about Renton's age, sit at the
kitchen table. They look up to see Renton in the doorway.
<b>                                     MAN
</b>
     Good Morning.

<b>                                    WOMAN
</b>
     Come in and sit down. You must be Mark.

Renton walks to the table and sits down.
<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     Yes, that's me.

<b>                                    WOMAN
</b>
     You're a friend of Diane's?

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     More of a friend of a friend, really.

<b>                                     MAN
</b>
     Right.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     Are you her flatmates?

The couple exchange a look and laugh.
<b>                                    WOMAN
</b>
     Flatmates. I must remember that one.

The Man and Woman look beyond Renton. He too turns and follows their gaze.

Diane stands in the doorway.

She is wearing school uniform.

<b>INT. GAIL'S HOME, HALL/KITCHEN. DAY
</b>
The door swings open to reveal the kitchen. Gail, her Father, and Mother are
seated around the table, eating breakfast. They look towards Spud, who
carries the knotted bundle of sheets as he approaches the table.
<b>                                    GAIL
</b>
     Good morning, Spud.

<b>                                    SPUD

</b>
     Sorry about last night -

<b>                                    GAIL
</b>
     It's all right. I slept fine on the sofa.

<b>                                    SPUD
</b>
     I had a little too much to drink. I'm afraid I had a slight
     accident.

<b>                                   FATHER
</b>
     Oh, don't worry, these things happen. It does everyone good to cut
     loose once in a while.

<b>                                    GAIL
</b>
     This one could do with being tied up once in a while.

<b>                                   MOTHER
</b>
     I'll put the sheets in the washing machine just now.

<b>                                    SPUD
</b>
     No, I'll wash them. I'll take them home and bring them back.

<b>                                   MOTHER
</b>
     There's no need.

<b>                                    SPUD
</b>
     It's no problem.

<b>                                   MOTHER
</b>
     No problem for me either.

<b>                                   MOTHER
</b>
     Honestly, it's no problem.

<b>                                    SPUD
</b>
     I'd really rather take care of it myself.

<b>                                   MOTHER
</b>
     Spud, they're my sheets.

She takes hold of the bundle.

Spud does not yield.

She pulls harder. Spud holds on. She tugs powerfully.

The bundle bursts open with an explosion of vomit and excrement that covers
everything in the kitchen.

Only Spud remains untouched.

Renton paces briskly down the street, followed by Diane.
<b>                                    DIANE
</b>I don't see why not.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     Because it's illegal.

<b>                                    DIANE
</b>
     Holding hands?

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     No, not holding hands.

<b>                                    DIANE
</b>
     In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more
     last night.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     And that's what's illegal. Do you know what they do to people like
     me inside? They'd cut my balls off and flush them down the fucking
     toilet.

They stop at the school gates.
<b>                                    DIANE
</b>
     Calm down. You're not going to jail.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     Easy for you to say.

<b>                                    DIANE
</b>
     Can I see you again?

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     Certainly not.

Renton walks away.
<b>                                    DIANE
</b>
     If you don't see me again I'll tell the police.

Renton turns and walks back to her. They stand for a moment, then Renton
walks away again. Diane smiles.
                                (to herself)

     I'll see you around then.

<b>EXT. RAIL BRIDGE. DAY
</b>
A train speeds across.

<b>INT. TRAIN. DAY
</b>
Sick Boy, Tommy, Spud and Renton sit drinking from an extensive carry-out.
<b>                                  SICK BOY
</b>
     This had better be good.

<b>                                    TOMMY
</b>
     It will be. It'll make a change for three miserable junkies who
     don't know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped
     doing smack.

<b>                                  SICK BOY
</b>
     If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just
     saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I
     could be doing.

<b>                                    TOMMY
</b>
     Such as?

<b>                                  SICK BOY
</b>
     Such as sitting in a darkened room, watching videos, drinking,
     smoking dope and wanking. Does that answer your question?

They sit in silence.

<b>---------
</b>
<b>EXT. STATION. DAY
</b>
The station is in the middle of a moor. There appears to be no habitation
around. In the distance are some hills.

The train stands at the station.

As it pulls away, Renton, Spud, Tommy and Sick Boy are left standing on the
platform, looking around.
<b>                                  SICK BOY
</b>
     Now what?

<b>                                    TOMMY

     We go for a walk.

<b>                                    SPUD
</b>
     What?

<b>                                    TOMMY
</b>
     A walk.

<b>                                    SPUD
</b>
     But where?

Tommy points vaguely across the moor.
<b>                                    TOMMY
</b>
     There.

<b>                                  SICK BOY
</b>
     Are you serious?

They step across the tracks toward the vast moorland. They stop.
All but Tommy sit down on rocks or clumps of heather.
<b>                                    TOMMY
</b>
     Well, what are you waiting for?

<b>                                    SPUD
</b>
     I don't know, Tommy. I don't know if it's... normal.

A group of three serious Walkers trudge past from the other end of the
platform, decked out in regulation Berghaus from head to foot. They tramp
off towards the wilderness. The boys watch them go.
Spud opens a can.
<b>                                    TOMMY
</b>
     It's the great outdoors.

<b>                                  SICK BOY

     It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?

<b>                                    TOMMY
</b>
     It's fresh air.

<b>                                  SICK BOY
</b>
     Look, Tommy, we know you're getting a hard time off Lizzy, but
     there's no need to take it out on us.

<b>                                    TOMMY
</b>
     Doesn't it make you proud to be Scottish?

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     I hate being Scottish. We're the lowest of the fucking low, the
     scum of the earth, the most wretched, servile, miserable, pathetic
     trash that was ever shat into civilization. Some people hate the
     English, but I don't. They're just wankers. We, on the other hand,
     are colonized by wankers. We can't even pick a decent culture to
     be colonized by. We are ruled by effete arseholes. It's a shite
     state of affairs and all the fresh air in the world will not make
     any fucking difference.

The three serious Walkers are receding into the distance.
The boys troop back towards the platform.
                                    (v.o)
At or around this time, we made a healthy, informed, democratic decision to
get

     back on drugs as soon as possible. It took about twelve hours.

Renton then begins cooking up.

Renton lies back, staring vacantly ahead.
Tommy flops down beside him. Renton shows barely a flicker of awareness.

     Lizzy's gone, Mark, she's gone and fucking dumped me. It was the

<b>INT. HOSPITAL WARD SITTING-ROOM. DAY

     look at, like, but personality, that's what counts, that's what
     keeps a relationship going through the years. Like heroin. I mean,

     Swanney taught us to adore and respect the National Health
     Service, for it was the source of much of our gear. We stole
     drugs, we stole prescriptions, or bought them, sold them, swapped
     them, forged them, photocopied them or traded them with cancer
     victims, alcoholics, old age pensioners, AIDS patients, epileptics
     and bored housewives. We took morphine, diamorphine, cyclozine,
     codeine, temazepam, nitrezepam, phenobarbitone, sodium amytal
     dextropropoxyphene, methadone, nalbuphine, pethidine, pentazocine,
     buprenorphine, dextromoramide chlormethiazole. The streets are
     awash with drugs that you can have for unhappiness and pain, and
     we took them all. Fuck it, we would have injected Vitamin C if
     only they'd made it illegal.

The GP examines Renton's chest and smiles.
The GP turns to wash his hands. Renton pulls on his shirt and steals a
prescription pad off the desk.

     But the good times couldn't last for ever.

<b>INT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. DAY
</b>
Renton lies as before. Around the room are Swanney, Allison, Tommy, Spud and
Sick Boy.
Allison begins screaming and wailing.
Slowly, the others rouse themselves to varying degrees.

</b>                                    (v.o)

     I think Allison had been screaming all day, but it hadn't really
     registered before. She might have been screaming for a week for
     all I knew. It's been days since I've heard anyone speak, though
     surely someone must have said something in all that time, surely
     to fuck someone must have.

<b>                                  SICK BOY

     What's wrong, Allison?

Allison points toward the bundle of dirty blankets in which her baby is
wrapped. Sick Boy follows her directions.
<b>                                    SPUD
</b>Calm down, calm down. It's going to be all right, everything's going to be

</b>                                    (v.o)

     Nothing could have been further from the truth. In point of fact,
     nothing at all was going to be just fine. On the contrary,
     everything was going to be bad. Bad? I mean worse than it already
     was.

Sick Boy stands over the bundle. The baby is dead.
<b>                                  SICK BOY
</b>Oh, fuck. Sick Boy reaches out to Allison.
<b>                                   RENTON
</b>                                    (v.o)

     It wasn't my baby. She wasn't my baby. Baby Dawn. She wasn't mine.
     Spud's? Swanney's? Sick Boy's? I don't know. Maybe Allison knew.
     Maybe not. I wished I could think of something to say, something
     sympathetic, something human.

<b>                                  SICK BOY
</b>Say something, Mark, say something --
<b>                                   RENTON
</b>I'm cooking' up. There is a silence.
Renton begins scrambling around through the works.
<b>                                   ALLISON
</b>
     Cook one for me, Renton. I need a hit.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>                                    (v.o)

     And so she did, I could understand that. To take the pain away. So
     I cooked up and she got a hit, but only after me. That went
     without saying.

<b>EXT. STREET. DAY
</b>
Renton, Spud and Sick Boy cross the road to approach the shop.
<b>                                   RENTON
</b>                                    (v.o)

     Well, at least we knew who the father was now. It wasn't just the
     baby that died that day. Something inside Sick Boy was lost and
     never returned. It seemed he had no theory with which to explain a
     moment like this.

<b>---------
</b>
<b>INT. SHOP. DAY
</b>
Renton, Spud and Sick Boy are stuffing their pockets, as seen before.
Renton's theft is interrupted by Diane's voice.
<b>                                    DIANE
</b>
     Hello there, Mark.

Diane is standing just beside him.

     What are you doing?

Renton is speechless, but a few stolen items fall from inside his jacket
down to the floor.
Diane looks down.
Spud and Sick Boy start to snigger.
One of the Store Detectives become aware of the group. He starts walking
towards them.

     You didn't tell me you were a thief.

<b>                                    SPUD
</b>
     Hey, go easy, lady. The boy's got a habit to support.

<b>                                  SICK BOY
</b>
     Opium doesn't just grow on trees, you know.

A few more items fall from Renton's jacket as the store Detective closes in.
Renton looks at Diane.

<b>---------
</b>
<b>EXT. STREET. DAY
</b>
Renton and Spud are running, pursued by the Two Store Detectives.
<b>                                   RENTON
</b>                                    (v.o)
Nor did I. Our only response was to keep on going and fuck everything. Pile
misery upon misery, heap it up on a spoon and dissolve it with a drop of
bile, then squirt it into a stinking purulent vein and do it all over again.
Keep on going: getting up, going out, robbing, stealing, fucking people
over, propelling ourselves with longing towards the day it would all go
wrong. As seen in the opening scene, Renton is nearly hit by a car that
screeches to a halt as he crosses a road.
He looks at the driver, at Spud running away and the Store Detectives
approaching.
                                    (v.o)
Because no matter how much you stash or how much you steal, you never have
enough. No matter how often you go out and rob and fuck people over you
always need to get up and do it all again. Renton smiles and waits.
                                    (v.o)
Sooner or later, this sort of thing was bound to happen. One of the
Detectives runs straight past him, after Spud.
The other Detective crashes into Renton with a mighty punch in the stomach.

<b>INT. COURT. DAY
</b>
Spud and Renton stand in the dock. Renton's Mother and Father, Sick Boy,
Begbie, and Spud's Mother (Mrs. Murphy) are among those in the gallery.
The Sheriff delivers his sentence.
<b>                                   SHERIFF
</b>
     ...because shoplifting is theft, which is a crime, and, despite
     what you may believe, there is no such entity as victimless crime.
     Heroin addiction may explain your actions, but it does not excuse
     them. Mr Murphy, you are a habitual thief, devoid of regret or
     remorse. In sentencing you to six months' imprisonment my only
     worry is that it will not be long before we meet again. Mr Renton,
     I understand that you have entered into a programme of
     rehabilation in an attempt to wean yourself away from heroin. The
     suspension of your sentence is conditional upon your continued
     cooperation with this programme. Should you stand guilty before me
     again, I shall not hesitate to impose a custodial sentence.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     Thank you, your honour. With God's help, I'll conquer this
     affliction.

The Sheriff and Renton stare at one another for a moment. Renton turns to
look at Spud, then back towards the Sheriff, who is now leaving the court.
                                    (v.o)

     What can you say? Well, Begbie had a phrase for it.

<b>INT. PUB I. DAY
</b>
The pub is crowded. Around Renton are his mother, Father, Begbie, Sick Boy
and Gav.
<b>                                   BEGBIE
</b>
     It was fucking obvious that that cunt was going to fuck some cunt.

There is a round to nodding and 'poor Spud'ing. Everyone begins to talk at
once.
<b>                                   FATHER
</b>
     I hope you've learned your lesson, son.

<b>                                   MOTHER
</b>
     Oh, my son, I thought I was going to lose you there. You're
     nothing but trouble to me, but I still love you.

<b>                                   BEGBIE
</b>
     Clean up your act, sunshine. Cut that shite out for ever.

<b>                                   MOTHER
</b>
     You listen to Francis, Mark, he's talking sense.

<b>                                   BEGBIE
</b>
Fucking right I am. See, inside, you wouldn't last two fucking days.

<b>                                  SICK BOY
</b>
There's better things that the needle, Rents. Choose life.

He winks.
<b>                                   MOTHER
</b>
I remember when you were a baby, even when you would never do what you were
told.

<b>                                   BEGBIE
</b>
     But he pulled it off, clever bastard, and he got a result.

They laugh, then fall silent.
Renton turns around. Behind him stands Spud's mother.
<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
Mrs Murphy, I'm sorry about Spud. It's wasn't fair, him going down and not
me --

Tears in her eyes, Mrs Murphy turns and walks away.
Renton watches her go. Behind him Begbie shouts.
<b>                                   BEGBIE
</b>
     It's no our fault. Your boy went down because he was fucking
     smack-head and if that's not your fault, I don't know what is.

Begbie turns back to Renton.

     Right. I'll get the drinks in.

He moves towards the bar.
Renton slips away.
Renton walks through the bar towards the toilets, then out of a back door.

<b>EXT. YARD. DAY
</b>
Renton emerges into a narrow yard surrounded by a high wall. He looks
around. The steel back gate is locked.
<b>                                   RENTON
</b>                                    (v.o)

     I wished I had gone down instead of Spud. Here I was surrounded by
     my family and my so-called mates and I've never felt so alone,
     never in all my puff. Since I was on remand they've had me on this
     programme, the state-sponsored addiction, three sickly sweet doses
     of methadone a day instead of smack. But it's never enough, and at
     the moment it's nowhere near enough. I took all three this morning
     and now I've got eighteen hours to go till my next shot and a
     sweat on my back like a layer of frost. I need to visit the mother
     superior for one hit, one fucking hit to get us over this long,
     hard day.

Renton climbs the wall. He stands on top, then dives off the other side,
executing a somersault in mid-air.

<b>INT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. NIGHT
</b>
Swanney is cooking up. Renton lands on the floor behind him like a gymnast.
<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     What's on the menu this evening?

<b>                                   SWANNEY
</b>
     Your favourite dish.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     Excellent.

<b>                                   SWANNEY
</b>
     Your usual table, sir?

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     Why, thank you.

Renton sits on his usual cushion on the floor.
<b>                                   SWANNEY
</b>
     And would sir care to settle his bill in advance?

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     Stick it on my tab.

<b>                                   SWANNEY
</b>
     Regret to inform, sir, that your credit limit was reached and
     breached a long time ago.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     In that case --

He produces twenty pounds.
<b>                                   SWANNEY
</b>
     Oh, hard currency, why, sir, that'll do nicely.

He swipes the notes underneath a UV forgery checker.

     Can't be too careful when we're dealing with your type, can we?

Renton begins his search for a vein.

     Would sir care for a starter? Some garlic bread perhaps?

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     No, thank you. I'll proceed directly to the intravenous injection
     of hard drugs, please.

<b>                                   SWANNEY
</b>
     As you wish.

He hands Renton the syringe. Renton inject, then lies back on the dirty,
red, carpeted floor. He lies completely still. His pupils shrink. His
breathing becomes slow, shallow and intermittent. He sinks into the floor
until he is lying in a coffin-shaped and coffin-sized pit, lined by the red
carpet. Swanney stands over him.
<b>                                   SWANNEY
</b>
     Perhaps sir would like me to call for a taxi?

An ambulance siren becomes faintly audible.

<b>INT. SWANNEY'S STAIRWELL. NIGHT
</b>
The siren is a little louder. Swanney holds Renton under his arms and drags
him backwards down the steps.

<b>EXT. STREET. NIGHT
</b>
As Swanney emerges, still dragging Renton, the siren grows louder and then
an ambulance speeds by without stopping. Swanney drags Renton across the
pavement and into the open door of a waiting taxi. Swanney then steps out of
the taxi's other door, pausing only to tuck a ten-pound note into Renton's
pocket before closing the door.

<b>INT. TAXI. NIGHT
</b>
Renton lies on the floor of the taxi, as Swanney left him, rolling slightly
as the taxi takes a corner.

<b>EXT. HOSPITAL/TAXI. NIGHT
</b>
The taxi is stationary. We do not see the driver's face but his hand opens
the door and then drags Renton out on to the pavement by his ankles before
taking the ten pound note, getting back in the cab and driving away. Renton
lies on the pavement. Two Porters life him by arms and ankles on to a
trolley. We do not see the Porters's faces as they wheel Renton into the
hospital.

<b>INT. HOSPITAL ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. NIGHT
</b>
Renton is wheeled through the department, then into a bay surrounded by a
white nylon curtain.

<b>INT. TROLLEY BAY. NIGHT
</b>
The Porters lift Renton from one trolley on to another, then leave him alone
in the bay surrounded by the curtain. Renton lies alone. His breathing is
still shallow and erratic. Around him is the usual accident and emergency
paraphernalia: blood pressure machine, oxygen tap, bandages, etc. A Doctor
comes in and gives Renton an injection, then leaves.
<b>                                   DOCTOR
</b>
     Wake up. Wake up.

Renton breathes more easily.

<b>---------
</b>
The Two Porters return with another trolley. They lift Renton roughly on to
it and wheel him away.

<b>INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR. NIGHT
</b>
The Porters wheel Renton along.

<b>INT. WARD. NIGHT
</b>
The Porters lift Renton off the trolley and dump him on the bed. A nurse
sticks a thermometer in his mouth.

<b>INT. WARD. DAY
</b>
Renton's Father and Mother lift Renton, now fully conscious, off the bed and
dump him in a wheelchair.

<b>INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR. DAY
</b>
Mother walks ahead. Behind her, Father pushes Renton in the wheelchair.

<b>---------
</b>
<b>INT. TAXI. DAY
</b>
Mother and Father sit on either side of Renton.

<b>INT. RENTON'S BEDROOM. DAY
</b>
Father shoves Renton on to the bed, then walks out past Mother, who looks at
Renton for a moment before closing the door.

<b>INT. OTHER SIDE OF RENTON'S BEDROOM DOOR. DAY
</b>
Renton's Father's hand slides three bolts across to lock the door.

<b>INT. RENTON'S BEDROOM. DAY
</b>
Renton lies on the bed.
<b>                                   RENTON
</b>                                    (v.o)

     I don't feel the sickness yet, but it's in the post, that's for
     sure. I'm in the junky limbo at the moment, too ill to sleep, too
     tired to stay awake, but the sickness is on its way. Sweat,
     chills, nausea, pain and craving. Need like nothing else I have
     ever known will soon take hold of me. It's on the way.

The door opens. Renton's Mother walks in with a bowl of soup and a piece of
bread. Father watches from the doorway.
<b>                                   MOTHER
</b>
     We'll help you, son. You'll stay with us until you get better.
     We'll beat this together.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     Maybe I could go back to the clinic.

<b>                                   MOTHER
</b>
     No. No clinics, no methadone. That made you worse, you said so
     yourself. You lied to us, son, your own mother and father.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     At least get us some Tempazepam.

<b>                                   MOTHER
</b>
     No, you're worse coming off that than you are with heroin. Nothing
     at all.

<b>                                   FATHER
</b>
     It's a clean break this time.

<b>                                   MOTHER
</b>
     You're staying where we can keep an eye on you.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     I do appreciate what you're trying to do, I really do, but I need
     just one score, to ease myself off it. Just one. Just one.

Mother retreats past Father, who closes the door. The bolts go home again.
Renton lies back and closes his eyes. His forehead is damp with sweat. He
begins to shake. He tosses and turns, becoming wrapped up in a swathe of
blankets. As he unravels them, he is astonished to find a fully clothed
Begbie in the bed with him.
<b>                                   BEGBIE
</b>
     Well, this is a good laugh, you fucking useless bastard. Go on,
     sweat that shite out of your system, because if I come back and
     it's still there, I'll fucking kick it out.

Begbie laughs and covers himself up. Renton rips away the blankets, but
Begbie has gone. Renton looks up. Baby Dawn is crawling across the ceiling.
Renton looks down to see Diane sitting on the end of the bed. Diane sings
'Temptation' by New Order.
<b>                                    DIANE
</b>
     'Oh, you've got green eyes, oh, you've got red eyes, and I've
     never met anyone quite like you before.'

Renton looks back up. Dawn continues her slow crawl, leaving behind a thick
rail of unidentifiable slime. Renton looks down. Sick Boy sits on the end of
the bed, holding a cup of tea and a chocolate biscuit. Mother stands behind
him.
<b>                                  SICK BOY
</b>
     It's a mug's game, Mrs Renton. I'm not saying I was blameless
     myself, far from it, but there comes a time when you have to turn
     your back on that nonsense and just say no.

Sick Boy takes a bit of his biscuit. Dawn crawls on. She has fangs now. Spud
sits on the end of the bed, in a caricature prison uniform with arrows on
it, plus a ball and chain. Dawn has claws as well. Tommy sits on the end of
the bed. He looks terrible.
<b>                                    TOMMY
</b>
     Better than sex, Rents, better than sex. The ultimate hit. I'm a
     fucking adult. I'll find out for myself. Well, I've found out all
     right.

Renton looks up again just as the baby drops on to his face. He tears her
off and throws her into a corner. Renton's Mother and Father are washing
him. Mother bends down and picks up the large, damp sponge from the corner,
where it landed. She wipes her son's face with it.
<b>                                   FATHER
</b>
     Mark, there's something you need to do.

<b>---------
</b>
<b>INT. CONSULTING ROOM. DAY
</b>
A Doctor stands up as Renton enters.
<b>                                   DOCTOR
</b>
     Come in. Sit down, please.

They both sit down.

     Well, you've already spoken to one of our counsellors, but before
     we go on there're just a few questions I'd like to ask you.

<b>---------
</b>
<b>INT. RENTON FAMILY HOME, LIVING-ROOM. DAY
</b>
Renton, his mother and Father sit watching television.

<b>INT. STUDIO. DAY
</b>
Renton is sitting inside a plastic booth shaped like a giant syringe. The
Doctor, now dressed as a game-show host, stands in front, with Renton's
Mother and Father beside him.
<b>                                   DOCTOR
</b>
     Question number one: the human immunodeficiency virus is a - what?

<b>                                   FATHER
</b>
     Retrovirus?

<b>                                   DOCTOR
</b>
     Retrovirus is the correct answer.

Fanfare.

     Question number two: HIV binds to which receptor on the host
     lymphocyte? Which Receptor?

Mother and Father confer.
<b>                                   FATHER
</b>
<b>     CD4.
</b>
<b>                                   DOCTOR
</b>
     CD4 receptor is the correct answer.

Fanfare.

     And now, question number three: is he guilty or not guilty?

<b>                                   MOTHER
</b>
     He's our son.

<b>                                   DOCTOR
</b>
     Is the correct answer.

Fanfare.

     And now it's time to 'Take the Test'.

Lights flash. Music. A garish Hostess walks on with two envelopes. She holds
them out for Mother to choose one.

<b>INT. CONSULTING ROOM. DAY
</b>
The Doctor watches in silence as the Hostess, now dressed as a medical
technician, draws blood from Renton's arm and puts it into a tube. She marks
the tube with a pre-printed, numbered label.

<b>INT. STUDIO. DAY
</b>
Mother opens one of the envelopes. She is speechless with joy. The plastic
booth opens up. Lights flash again, etc. Renton steps out.

<b>INT. SOCIAL CLUB. NIGHT
</b>
Renton, his Mother and Father sit at a table in the local social club. It is
a Saturday night and the club is busy. Everyone sits in rapt silence. It is
not initially clear what is going on. Near the bar a Caller with a
microphone calls over the PA - Two and four,
twenty-four...seven...fifteen...clickety-click, sixty-six - And so on, as he
draws the numbers from the drum. Everyone studies their cards, except
Renton, who studies the people instead, his drink untouched. The
number-calling continues until suddenly interrupted by Mother's voice.
<b>                                   MOTHER
</b>Mark...Mark, you've got a house. House! House! For goodness's sake, Mark.
They bustle around him and pass his card to the front.
<b>                                   RENTON
</b>                                    (v.o)

     It seems, however, that I really am the luckiest guy in the world.
     Several years of addiction right in the middle of an epidemic,
     surrounded by the living dead, but not me -- I'm negative. It's
     official. And once the pain goes away, that's when the real battle
     starts. Depression. Boredom. You feel so fucking low, you'll want
     to fucking top yourself.

His mother counts a wad of money in front of him.

<b>EXT. HOUSING ESTATE. DAY
</b>
On the door of a flat 'plaguer', 'HIV', and 'junky AIDS scum' are daubed on
the walls. The sound of a ball being regularly bounced against a wall can be
heard.

<b>INT. TOMMY'S FLAT. NIGHT
</b>
It is poorly furnished. Tommy is seated. Renton has the football, which he
kicks against the wall and catches, then drops and kicks again, and so on.
The ball is slightly flat.
<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     Are you getting out much?

<b>                                    TOMMY
</b>
     No.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     Following the game at all?

<b>                                    TOMMY
</b>
     No.

<b>                                   RENTON

     No. Me Neither.

Renton drops the ball. It rolls to a halt in the corner. He sits down.

Renton produces some of his bingo win. As he hands the notes over, their
eyes and hands meet for a moment. Tommy puts the money away.

<b>INT. HOSPITAL. NIGHT
</b>
Renton walks along a corridor and into a ward.

<b>INT. WARD. DAY
</b>
Sheets cover the lower half of Swanney in bed. They are thrown back to
reveal the stump of an above-knee amputation.
<b>                                   SWANNEY
</b>
     Surprise! Pa-pah!

Renton sits down and takes it in silence.

     Hit the artery by mistake. Common enough error, or so the quack
     tells us, as though that's going to make my leg grown back. Still,
     it could have been worse, it could have been my fucking dick. And
     I tell you what, in this place you get looked after: clean sheets,
     regular meals and all the morphine you can eat.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     Great.

<b>                                   SWANNEY
</b>
     And see when I get out of here. I've got plans. Going to get
     myself straightened out and head off to Thailand, where women
     really know how to treat a guy. See, out there you can live like a
     king if you've got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your
     pocket. No fucking problem.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     Sure.

<b>                                   SWANNEY
</b>
     The strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and
     this time next year I'll be watching the rising sun with a posse
     of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     Sounds great, Swanney.

<b>                                   SWANNEY

<b>EXT. PARK. DAY
</b>
Renton and Sick Boy are seated in their firing patch, sitting on plastic
bags with beer, vodka, hash and the cassette player. The airgun is present
as before, but they are not making any use of it.

</b>
     And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and
     the whole fucking stump fell off.

<b>                                  SICK BOY
</b>
     Cut it out.

     When are you going to visit him?

<b>                                  SICK BOY

</b>
     You're a real mate. And what about Tommy? Have you been to see him
     yet?

Sick Boy is silent. He stiffens as he avoids Renton's gaze. They shift
fractionally apart. RENTON tuts.
<b>                                  SICK BOY

</b>
     I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what
     they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the
     punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me. Not
     exactly a fortune, but I'm thinking, 'I should be coining it
     here.' Less whores, more skag. Swanney's right. Get clean, get
     into dealing, that's where the future lies. Set up some contacts,
     get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. What do you think?

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     Fuck you.

<b>                                  SICK BOY
</b>
     And I'll tell you why. Because I'm fed up to my back teeth with
     losers, no-hopers, draftpacks, schemies, junkies and the like. I'm
     getting on with life. What are you doing?

<b>INT. RENTON'S BEDSIT. NIGHT

Renton sits alone on the bed, making a joint and reading a book. There is a
knock at the door. Renton answers the door.

     Well, it isn't.

     Too young for what?

Renton looks in each direction along the empty passageway.

<b>INT. RENTON'S BEDSIT. NIGHT
</b>
Renton and Diane are lying in the bed. Diane, wearing one of Renton's
T-shirts, is rolling a mega-joint, quite unaware of the scrutiny of Renton.

     You're not getting any younger, Mark. The world is changing, music

     day dreaming about heroin and Ziggy Pop.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     It's Iggy Pop.

     Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.

</b>                                    (v.o)

     She was right. I had to find something new. There was only one
     thing for it.

<b>EXT. LONDON. DAY
</b>
As contemporary retake of all those 'Swinging London' montages: Red
Routemaster/Trafalgar Square/Big Ben/Royalty/City gents in suits/Chelsea
ladies/fashion victims/Piccadilly Circus at night. Incut with close-ups of
classic street names on a street map (all the ones made famous by Monopoly.

<b>INT. ESTATE AGENT'S OFFICE. DAY
</b>
The montage ends on one street, then draws back to reveal the whole map of
London pinned to a wall. A Man holding a telephone walks in front of the
mape and belches loudly. Revealing more, he is in a scruffy, cramped office
with half a dozen occupied desks and twice as many telephones. Seated at the
one nearest to the belching Man is Renton. He is wearing a shirt and tie
now. He turns in response to the belch.
<b>                                     MAN
</b>
     Can you take this call?

Renton takes the telephone and reaches for a piece of paper from which he
reads.
<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     Hello, yes, certainly. It's a beautifully converted Victorian town
     house. Ideally located in a quiet road near to local shops and
     transport.

Renton checks his watch.

<b>EXT. THE AI IN NORTH LONDON. DAY
</b>
Renton stands waiting beside this busy London road, outside some very
unfortunate housing, as the traffic streams past.
<b>                                   RENTON
</b>                                    (v.o)

     Two bedrooms and a kitchen/diner. Fully fitted in excellent
     decorative order. Lots of storage space. All mod cons. Three
     hundred and twenty pounds per week.

A couple approach. Renton unlocks the door of a flat and holds the door open
while he ushers them in.

<b>INT. LONDON FLAT. DAY
</b>
Renton shows the Couple round a typical London flat nightmare. A poor
conversion, poor decor, everything small and ill-fitting. The windows rattle
as the traffic roars by.
<b>                                   RENTON
</b>                                    (v.o)

     I settled in not too badly and I kept myself to myself. Sometimes,
     of course, I thought about the guys, but mainly I didn't miss them
     at all. After all, this was boom town where any fool could make
     cash from chaos and plenty did. I quite enjoyed the sound of it
     all. Profit, loss, margins, takeovers, lending, letting,
     subletting, subdividing, cheating, scamming, fragmenting, breaking
     away. There was no such thing as society and even if there was, I
     most certainly had nothing to do with it. For the first time in my
     adult life I was almost content.

<b>INT. LONDON BEDSIT. NIGHT
</b>
Renton finishes eating a pot noodle. He puts it down and picks up a letter.
He lies back and reads. Intercut with:

<b>INT. SCHOOLROOM. DAY
</b>
A class is in progress. A teacher lectures to a mixed class, but Diane is
not listening as she is writing.

<b>EXT. SCHOOL. DAY
</b>
Diane is leaving the school when Sick Boy catches up with her. They stop and
then she walks away.

<b>EXT. PARK. DAY
</b>
Diane walks along a concrete path. As she does so she has to step over Spud,
who lies asleep/unconscious beside the remains of a carry out.

     Dear Mark, I'm glad you've found a job and somewhere to live.
     School is fine at the moment. I'm not pregnant but thanks for
     asking. Your friend Sick Boy asked me last week if I would like to
     work for him but I told him where to go. I met Spud, who sends his
     regards, or at least I think that's what he said. No one has seen
     Tommy for ages. And finally, Fracis Begbie has been on television
     a lot this week. --

Renton turns the page.

     in a jeweller's in Corstorphine. Take care. Yours with love,

There is a buzz at the door. Renton re-examines the letter. There is another
buzz.
<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     Oh no.

<b>INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE BEDSIT. NIGHT
</b>
Renton opens the door to an unseen figure. It is Begbie.

<b>INT. BEDSIT. NIGHT
</b>
Renton sits on the bed. Begbie stands over him, pointing a gun at his head.
He pulls the trigger. It clicks harmlessly.
<b>                                   BEGBIE
</b>
     Armed robbery? With a replica? How can it be armed robbery? It's a
     fucking scandal.

He 'fires' the gun a few more times at his own head, then chucks it to the
floor.

     And the haul. Look.

He digs a few rings out of his pocket and throws them to Renton.

     Solid silver, my arse. I took it to a fence -- it's trash, pure
     trash. There's young couples investing all their hopes in that
     stuff, and what are they getting?

<b>                                   RENTON

     It's a scandal, Franco.

     fucking Lee Marvin, by the way.

<b>INT. BEDSIT. DAY

Begbie is sitting on the bed in his underwear, eating cereal while watching
television. A small carry-out is nearby. Renton finishes dressing for work.
He pauses at the open door, looking back towards his guest.

     Begbie settled in in no time at all.

Begbie opens a can of beer. Renton closes the door.

<b>INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE BEDSIT. DAY

Renton closes his door. He is about to walk away when he heard Begbie
shouting.

     Rents, Rents, come fucking back here.

Renton opens the door. Begbie is holding out an empty packet of cigarettes.

     Look.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     What?

<b>                                   BEGBIE

Begbie throws the packet down to the floor. It lands near the door. He has
turned back to the television and takes a swig of beer.
<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     Right.

Renton closes the door again.

<b>INT. BEDSIT. NIGHT

Renton and Begbie lie in the single bed with their heads at opposite ends.
Begbie snores. Renton is wide awake, with a pair of smelly- socked feet only
inches from his nose.

     what can you do?

<b>INT. LONDON BEDSIT. DAY

Where the first empty packet of cigarettes fell to the floor there is now a
large heap of empty packets: the product of weeks at sixty a day. Another
one lands on the pile. Begbie, still in his underwear, still can in hand,
sits watchig the racing as before. Behind his, cigarettes and alcohol are
stacked up like a miniature duty-free warehouse. Renton sits behind him,
reading a book.

     streets. Now watch my lips. Kempton Park. Two-thirty. Five pounds
     to win. Bad Boy.

<b>INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE BEDSIT. DAY
</b>
The door opens, Renton walks out, the door closes and Renton walks away. A
wild, frightening scream erupts from beyond the door.

<b>INT. LONDON BEDSIT. DAY
</b>
Begbie, alone in the bedsit, is screaming a cry of primal joy.

     Bad Bot came in at 16 to 1. And with the winnings, we went out to
     celebrate.

<b>INT. LONDON PARTY. NIGHT
</b>
To loud music and strobing, fractured lights, surrounded by dry ice, Begbie
dances near a tall woman. Other people dance nearby. Begbie gives the thumbs
up to Renton, who sits on a stool at one side drinking from a bottle of
beer. Begbie and the Woman walk away. Renton looks around the club at the
various men and women.

     Diane was right. The world is changing, music is changin, drugs
     are changing, even men and women are changing. One thousand years
     from now there'll be no guys and no girls, just wankers. Sounds
     great to me. It's just a pity that no one told Begbie.

<b>EXT. STREET. NIGHT
</b>
A car sits in a street near the club, windows steamed up.

<b>INT. CAR. NIGHT

Begbie and the Woman embrace passionately. The Woman undoes Begbie's
trousers.

Renton's gaze continues to wander around.

     It's all about aesthetics and it's fuck all to do with morality.

Suddenly Bedbie freezes. He is holding the 'Woman's' groin. There is
something there that shouldn't be. Begbie goes crazy, simultaneously trying
to put his clothes back on, hit the Woman and get out of the car.

<b>EXT. STREET. NIGHT

Begbie stumbles away from the car, pulling up his trousers as he goes.

     But you try telling Begbie that.

<b>INT. BEDSIT. NIGHT
</b>
Begbie sits on the bed. Renton is sitting on the floor watching.
<b>                                   BEGBIE
</b>
     I'm no a fucking buftie and that's the end of it.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     Let's face it, it could have been wonderful.

Begbie leaps off the bed, grabs Renton and head-butts him, then holds him by
the lapel.
<b>                                   BEGBIE
</b>
     Now, listen to me, you little piece of junky shit. A joke's a
     fucking joke, but you mention that again and I'll cut you up.
     Understand?

Begbie produces his knife. There is a knock on the door. They do not move.
There is another knock.

<b>INT. BEDSIT. NIGHT
</b>
Begbie lies sleeping on the bed. There are now two sets of feet by his head,
one on each side. At the other end lie Renton (awake) and Sick Boy (asleep).

</b>                                    (v.o)

     Since I last saw him, Sick Boy had reinvented himself as a pimp
     and a pusher and was here to mix business and pleasure, setting up
     'contacts', as he constantly informed me, for the great skag deal
     that was one day going to make him rich.

<b>INT. ESTATE AGENT'S OFFICE. DAY

Renton sits at his desk, haggard and tired. Other people bustle around him.
Telephones ring, etc... In the background the Man (who belched) is trying to
promote a flat down the telephone.

Renton (still dressed for work), Begbie and Sick Boy sit in a line on the
bed with fish suppers laid out on their laps, but Renton's is untouched.

</b>
     Good chips.

</b>
     I can't believe you did that.

<b>                                  SICK BOY

     I got a good price for it. Rents, I need the money.

     It was my fucking television.

</b>
     Well, Christ, if I'd known you were going to get so humpty about
     it, I wouldn't have bothered. Are you going to eat that?

He takes Renton's fish supper and adds it to his own.

     Have you got a passport?

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     Why?

<b>                                  SICK BOY
</b>
     Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts.
     Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to
     foreigners. Get you a good price.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     Why would I want to sell my passport?

<b>                                  SICK BOY
</b>
     It was just an idea.

<b>INT. LEFT LUGGAGE ROOM. DAY
</b>
Renton drops his passport into an envelope and throws the envelope into a
locker. He turns the key and pockets it. RENTON (v.o)

     I had to get rid of them. Sick Boy didn't do his drug deal and he
     didn't get rich. Instead, he and Begbie just hung around my bedsit
     looking for things to steal. I decided to put them in the worst
     place in the world.

<b>EXT. BUSY LONDON ROAD. DAY
</b>
Traffic floods past as before.

<b>INT. LONDON FLAT. DAY
</b>
Inside the flat that Renton showed the couple around. Sick Boy and Begbie
are standing in the hallway. Renton is in the open doorway. He throws them
the keys and leaves.

<b>INT. LONDON BEDSIT. NIGHT
</b>
The cramped bedsit is a mess, filled with litter and unwashed clothes.
Renton lies on his bed, content to be alone.

<b>INT. LONDON FLAT. NIGHT

The flat is in darkness. The door opens a figure enters. It is the man from
Renton's office.

</b>                                    (v.o)

     But, of course, they weren't paying any rent, so when my boss
     found two desperate suckers who would, Sick Boy and Begbie were
     bound to feel threatened.

Man is followed by another couple. He switches on a light.

     As you can see, it's a beautiful conversion. Two bedrooms,

Renton looks around the stripped, empty bedsit one last time before closing

</b>                                    (v.o)

     No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke.

     Eh? How's that?

<b>INT. CREMATORIUM CHAPEL. DAY
</b>
A service is in progress. Those present include Renton and Gav, who are
engaged in hushed conversation, Begbie, Spud, Sick Boy, and Lizzy.
<b>                                     GAV
</b>
     He wanted to see Lizzy again.

He indicated Lizzy. Lizzy wouldn't let him near the house. So he brought a
present for her, brought her a kitten.
<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     I bet Lizzy told him where to put it.

<b>                                     GAV
</b>
     Exactly. I'm not wanting a cat, she says. Get to fuck, right. So
     there's Tommy stuck with this kitten. You can imagine what
     happened. The thing was neglected, pissing and shitting all over
     the place. Tommy was lying around fucked out of his eyeballs on
     smack or downers. He didn't know you could get toxoplasmosis from
     cat shit.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     I didn't either. What the fuck is it?

<b>INT. TOMMY'S FLAT. DAY

The kitten as before. Slow track back to reveal more.

</b>                                    (v.o)

     He starts getting headaches, so he just uses more smack, for the
     pain, like. There he has a stroke. A fucking stroke. Just like
     that. God home from hospital and died about three weeks later.
     Been dead for ages before the neighbours complained about the
     smell and the police broke the door down. Tommy was lying face
     down in a pool of vomit.

The lower half of Tommy's clothed body is visible.

The coffin travels away. Gav and Renton watch it go.

     The kitten was fine.

<b>INT. PUB I. NIGHT

Gav, Renton, Spud, Sick Boy, Begbie and a few others are gathered in the
pub, still dressed in their funeral garb.

</b>
<b>                                    SPUD
</b>
     Every time I think of Tommy I think of Australian, because every
     time I went round he was just lying there, junked out of his mind,
     watching Aussie soaps. Until he sold the telly, of course, then he
     was just lying there. Buy every time I think of him, I still think
     of Australia.

There is a short silence before Spud begins softly singing 'Two Little
Boys'. He finishes unaccompanied.

<b>INT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. NIGHT

Spud, Begbie, and Renton are seated. Sick Boy is handing around bottles of
beer before he too sits down. They are all wearing their funeral garb.
Renton raises his bottle.

</b>
     How much?

<b>                                  SICK BOY
</b>
     About four kilos. So he tells me. Got drunk in a pub down by the
     docks last week, where he met two Russian sailors. They're fucking
     carrying the stuff. For sale there and then, like. So he wakes up
     the next morning, realizes what he's done and get very fucking
     nervous. Wants rid of this. {---------- He's looking for Swanney
     to punt it, but Swanney's nowhere to be seen since he lost his
     leg. ----------}

     So?

<b>                                  SICK BOY
</b>
     So he met me and I offered to take it off his hands at a very
     reasonable price, with the intention of punting it on myself to a
     guy I know in London.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     So we've just come from Tommy's funeral and you're telling me
     about a skag deal?

     Two thousand, one hundred and thirty-three pounds.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     Four kilos. That's what -- Ten years' worth? Russian sailors?
     Mikey Forrester? What the fuck are you on these days? You've been
     to jail, Spud, so what's the deal -- like it so much you want to
     go back again?

<b>                                    SPUD
</b>
     I want the money, Mark, that's all.

<b>                                   BEGBIE

     It's so simple. We buy it at four grand, we punt it at twenty to

Heroin is in the process of being prepared for injection: heated, drawn up,

veins tapped, etc. Mikey forrester, Sick Boy, Spud, and Begbie look on.

</b>                                    (v.o)

     I hadn't told anyone everything that was running through my mind
     about what might happen in London. There were a lot of
     possibilities I didn't want to talk to anyone about. Ideas best
     kept to myself. What no one told me was that when we bought the
     skag, some lucky punter would have to try it out. Begbie didn't
     trust Spud and Sick Boy was too careful these days, so I rolled up
     my sleeve and did what had to be done.

Renton injects the heroin into a vein in his arm.

     This was his nightmare. The dodgiest scam in a lifetime of dodgie
     scams being perpetrated with three of the most useless and
     unreliable fuck-ups in town. I knew what was going on in his mind:
     any trouble in London and he would dump us immediately, one way or
     another. He had to. If he got caught with a bagful of skag, on top
     of that armed robbery shit, he was going down for fifteen to
     twenty. Begbie was hard, but not so hard that he didn't shite it
     off twenty years in Saughton.

<b>                                   ANDREAS
</b>
     These are your friends?

<b>                                  SICK BOY
</b>
     These are the guys I told you about.

<b>                                   ANDREAS
</b>
<b>     OK.
</b>
<b>                                  SICK BOY
</b>
     Is he here?

<b>                                   ANDREAS
</b>
     Yes, he's here. I hope you didn't get followed or nothing.

<b>                                   BEGBIE
</b>
     We didn't get followed.

Andreas leads them along a corridor and into a room.

<b>INT. HOTEL ROOM. DAY
</b>
An exceptional Man is waiting. Andreas leaves the room and closes the door.
The Man opens both and tastes the heroin. He produces a set of kitchen
scales from his bag and weighs the two bags.
<b>                                   RENTON
</b>                                    (v.o)

     Straight away he clocked us from what we were: small-time wasters
     with an accidental big deal.

<b>                                     MAN
</b>
     So what do you want for it?

<b>                                   BEGBIE
</b>
     Twenty thousand.

<b>                                     MAN
</b>
     But it's not worth more than fifteen.

<b>                                   BEGBIE
</b>
     Ninteen.

The man shakes his head and lights a cigarette.
<b>                                     MAN
</b>
     Nineteen I can't offer you, I'm sorry.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>                                    (v.o)

     This was a real drag to him. He didn't need to negotiate. I mean,
     what the fuck were we going to do if he didn't buy it? Sell it on
     the streets. Fuck that.

The deal is done. The Man hands over the money and waits as it is counted,
then leaves with the drugs.
                                    (v.o)

     We settled on sixteen thousand pounds. He had a lot more in the
     suitcase, but it was better than nothing. And just for a moment it
     felt really great, like we were all in it together, like friends,
     like it meant something. A moment like that, it can touch you deep
     inside, but it doesn't last long, not like sixteen thousand
     pounds.

<b>INT. LONDON PUB. DAY
</b>
The pub is crowded with afternoon drinkers. Renton, Spud, Sick Boy and
Begbie sit drinking. Begbie is still keeping a firm hand on the sports bag,
which now holds the money.
<b>                                  SICK BOY
</b>
     So what are you planning with your share, Spud?

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     Buy yourself that island in the sun?

<b>                                   BEGBIE
</b>
     For four fucking grand? One plam tree, a couple of rocks, and a
     sewage outflow.

<b>                                    SPUD
</b>
     I don't know, maybe I'll buy something for my ma, and then buy
     some good speed, no bicarb like, then get a girl, take her out
     like, and treat her -- properly.

<b>                                   BEGBIE
</b>
     Shag her senseless.

<b>                                    SPUD
</b>
     No, I don't mean like that -- I mean something nice, like, that's
     all --

<b>                                   BEGBIE
</b>
     You daft cunt. If you're going to waste it like that, you might as
     well leave it all to me. Now get the drinks in.

<b>                                  SICK BOY
</b>
     I got a round already.

<b>                                    SPUD
</b>
     I got the last one.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     It's your round Franco.

Begbie stands up.
<b>                                   BEGBIE
</b>
     OK. Same again?

<b>                                  SICK BOY
</b>
     I'm off for a pish. When I come back, that money's still here, OK?

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     The moment you turn your back, we're out that door.

Sick Boy walks away towards the toilet.
<b>                                  SICK BOY
</b>
     I'll be right after you.

<b>                                   BEGBIE
</b>
     You'll never catch us, you flabby bastard. Right, see, when I come
     back --

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     We'll be half-way down the road with the money.

<b>                                   BEGBIE
</b>
     I'd fucking kill you.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     I guess you would, Franco.

Begbie walks away to the bar. Spud and Renton look at each other and the bag
of money.

     Are you game for it?

Spud looks at the bag and around the pub towards the toilet door and Begbie.
Begbie stands at the bar, awaiting the pints.

     Well?

<b>                                    SPUD
</b>
     Are you serious?

Renton looks around.
<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     I don't know. What do you think?

Spud says nothing. Suddenly they are interrupted.
<b>                                  SICK BOY
</b>
     Still here, I see.

Sick Boy sits down.
<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     Why not? I know I would. Where's Franco?

Renton turns to see Begbie making his way through the crowd with the pints
helf precariously. As he reaches the table a Man standing with a group of
friends accidentally nudges Begbie, causing a pint to spill over him.
<b>                                   BEGBIE
</b>
     For fuck's sake.

<b>                                     MAN
</b>
     Sorry, mate, I'll get you another.

<b>                                   BEGBIE
</b>
     All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.

<b>                                     MAN
</b>
     Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

<b>                                   BEGBIE
</b>
     Sorry's no going to dry me off, you cunt.

<b>                                   RENTON
</b>
     Cool down, Franco. The guy's sorry.

<b>                                   BEGBIE
</b>
     Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.

<b>                                     MAN
</b>
     Fuck you. If you can't hold a pint, you shouldn't be in the pub,
     mate. Now fuck off.

Begie drops the remaining three pints. As the Man looks down to the falling
glasses, Begbie punches him in the face and knees him in the groin. A fight
breaks out between the Man and Begbie. Sick Boy rushes forward to restrain
Begbie. Renton sits still, not even looking at the fight or what follows.
His eyes are fixed on the bag while his hands fiddle. Begbie stabs Spud in
the hand.
<b>                                    SPUD
</b>
     Jesus Christ.

<b>                                  SICK BOY
</b>
     Good one, Franco.

<b>                                   BEGBIE
</b>
     Shut you mouth or you'll be next.

<b>                                    SPUD
</b>
     You've stabbed me, man.

<b>                                   BEGBIE
</b>
     You were in my way.

Begbie, blade still in hand, addresses the entire pub.

     And anyone in my way gets it, fucking gets it. Everybody hear
     that? Everybody happy?

Nobody says anything. Renton is seated as before, avoiding Begbie's gaze.
Begbie addresses him.

     Hey, Rent-boy, bring us down a smoke.

Renton does not move.
<b>                                  SICK BOY
</b>
     We'd better go, Franco.

<b>                                    SPUD
</b>
     I've got to get to the hospital, man.

<b>                                   BEGBIE
</b>(to Spud)

     You're not going to and fucking hospital.

(to Sick Boy)

     You're staying there.

(to Renton)

     And you bring me a fucking cigarette.

Renton swivels and stands up.

     And the bag.

Renton lifts the bag and slowly approaches Begbie. Renton, nervous, hand
shaking, pulls a packet of cigarettes from a pocket and holds it towards
Begbie. Begbie does not move. Renton holds out the bag. Begbie takes it. Now
Renton selects a cigarette and hands it over to Begbie. Begbie inhales
deeply and then blows the smoke towards Renton

<b>INT. HOTEL ROOM. DAY
</b>
Renton lies awake, sharing a bed with Sick Boy, who is asleep. Spud and
Begbie lie on the other, both asleep. Begbie has an arm draped over the bag,
holding it close. Renton gets up and goes to the small bathroom. He puts the
light on above the mirror and looks at himself. He washes his face and
drinks a glass of water, then walks back to the bedroom. Renton pulls on his
jacket and shoes. He stands over Begbie, then reaches carefully down to life
Begbie's arm up. As he does so he realizes that Spud is watching him. They
say nothing. Renton takes the bag. Begbie stirs but does not wake.

<b>----------
</b>
Renton looks down at Spud for a moment before unzipping the bag. He pulls
out a small wad of cash, which he hands to Spud. Spud tucks the wad away.

<b>----------
</b>
Renton walks to the door and opens it. He nods to Spud, then disappears.

<b>INT. LOCKER. DAY
</b>
Envelope being removed.

<b>INT. LEFT LUGGAGE. DAY
</b>
Renton takes the passport from the envelope.

<b>EXT. STREET. DAY
</b>
Renton walks away.
<b>                                   RENTON
</b>                                    (v.o)

     Now, I've justified this to myself in all sorts of ways: it wasn't
     a big deal, just a minor betrayal, or we'd outgrown each other,
     you know, that sort of thing, but let's face it, I ripped them
     off. My so-called mayes. But Begbie, I couldn't give a shit about
     him, and Sick Boy, well, he'd have done the same to me if only
     he'd thought of it first, and Spud, well, OK, I felt sorry for
     Spud -- he never hurt anybody.

<b>INT. HOTEL. DAY
</b>
Prostitutes, punters, Sick Boy and Spud line the corridor as two Policement
walk past towards:

<b>INT. HOTEL ROOM. DAY
</b>
Begbie goes radge.

<b>EXT. STREET. DAY
</b>
<b>                                   RENTON
</b>                                    (v.o)

     So why did I do it? I could offer a million answers, all false.
     The truth is that I'm a bad person, but that's going to change,
     I'm going to change. This is the last of this sort of thing. I'm
     cleaning up and I'm moving on, going straight and choosing life.
     I'm looking forward to it already. I'm going to be just like you:
     the job, the family, the fucking big television, the washing
     machine, the car, the compact disc and electrical tin opener, good
     health, low cholesterol, dental insurance, mortgage, starter home,
     leisurewear, luggage, three-piece suite, DIY, game shows, junk
     food, children, walks in the park, nine to five, good at golf,
     washing the car, choice of sweaters, family Christmas, indexed
     pension, tax exemption, clearing the gutters, getting by, looking
     ahead, to the day you die.
