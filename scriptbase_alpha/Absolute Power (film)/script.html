</b><b>
</b><b>    FADE IN:
</b>
<b>1   INT. WASHINGTON MUSEUM - DAY                                   1
</b>
    The saddest eyes you ever saw.

    We are looking at an El Greco drawing.       It is a study for
    one of his paintings.

<b>    PULL BACK TO REVEAL --
</b>
    A bunch of art students are doing sketches of the eyes,
    the elongated fingers, the slender hands El Greco drew so
    brilliantly.

    Most of the students are around 20.        A couple of suburban
    housewives are there too.

    And one older man.

    This is LUTHER WHITNEY. Mid 60s, very fit, neatly
    dressed. At quick glance, he seems as if he might be a
    successful company executive.

    As we watch him draw we can tell he is capable of great
    concentration. And patient. With eyes that miss
    nothing: He has pilot's eyes.

    We'll find out more about him as time goes on, but this
    is all you really have to know: Luther Whitney is the
    hero of this piece. As we watch him draw --

    Luther's sketchbook. He is finishing his work on the
    eyes, and he's caught the sadness: It's good stuff.

    Luther. It's not good enough for him.        He looks at his
    work a moment, shakes his head.

<b>                                GIRL STUDENT
</b>               Don't give up.

<b>                                LUTHER
</b>               I never do.

<b>                                GIRL STUDENT
</b>               May I?

    She's indicated his sketchbook.      He nods.   She starts
    thumbing through.

    The sketchbook as the pages turn.

    Detail work. Eyes and hands. The eyes are good.         The
    hands are better. Very skillful.

<b>                                                     (CONTINUED)

      The GIRL hands it back.    Impressed.

<b>                                 GIRL STUDENT
</b>                   You work with your hands, don't
                   you?


<b>      CLOSEUP - LUTHER                                                  *
</b>
      An enigmatic smile.    Now, from that --


<b>2     EXT. RED'S BAR - DAY                                          2
</b>
      A nice working class part of town. Nothing fancy here
      but there's a pleasant feel. The streets are clean, the
      houses neat and well tended.

      Luther, carrying his sketchbook, walks along. It's
      afternoon now. Up ahead is a local bar: RED'S.


<b>3     INT. RED'S BAR - DAY                                       3
</b>
      Luther walks in. Nothing fancy here. Strictly working
      class. And relatively empty. An overweight bald man
      Luther's age works behind the bar. This is RED. They
      are good enough friends not to ask each other questions.

<b>                               LUTHER
</b>                       (as they nod to
                         each other)
                Redhead.

<b>                                RED
</b>                Luther.
                       (as Luther hands
                        him a videotape)
                Your life would be a whole lot
                simpler if you could learn to
                operate a V.C.R.

<b>                              LUTHER
</b>                My only failing.

      As he turns --


<b>4     EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - LUTHER'S HOUSE - DAY                   4
</b>
      A street of   small row houses. Clean, well tended.
      Luther walks   toward one. Later in the afternoon. He
      carries half   a dozen small shopping bags, from the
      market, the   hardware store, the drug store, the cleaners.
<b>
</b><b>                                                            3.
</b>
<b>5   EXT. LUTHER'S HOUSE - DAY                                    5
</b>
    A terra cotta planter to the right of the front door.
    Luther shifts his packages, tilts the planter slightly,
    bends down, pulls out a key, inserts it in the front
    door.


<b>6   INT. LUTHER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                          6
</b>
    as he enters. Neat, tidy. A Cuisinart, a cheese slicer,
    lots of other nice equipment. As he begins putting food
    away --


<b>7   INT. LUTHER'S HOUSE - DINING AREA - NIGHT                    7
</b>
    Evening now. Table set for one. A single candle.
    Beside the candle is Luther's sketch pad. Now Luther
    himself moves INTO VIEW, carrying a tray. He puts it
    down.

    A gorgeous omelet is on a fine china plate, parsley
    sprinkled neatly on top. An elegant green salad is on
    another plate, covered with thinly sliced parmesan
    cheese. An expensive water pitcher, a lovely glass.
    Clearly, a great deal of thought has gone into dinner.

    Luther lights the single candle. We are now aware of a
    photograph nearby. The picture is old. A pretty little
    girl stands in the center, smiling. Her mother stands
    alongside, smiling too. A man is with them, looking at
    them happily. It's Luther. When he was young.

    Luther studies the photo a moment.    Then he turns, looks
    out the window.


<b>8   POV SHOT - SLIVER OF MOON                                    8
</b>
    is visible.     Lovely.   Peaceful.


<b>9   LUTHER                                                       9
</b>
    Now Luther opens the sketch pad, quickly flips past the
    hands and eyes and faces --

    -- we are looking at something totally different:   a
    mansion.

    HOLD ON Luther's drawing of the mansion.

<b>    KEEP HOLDING.
</b>
    PULL BACK to reveal --
<b>
</b><b>                                                               4.
</b>
<b>10   EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - NIGHT                                  10
</b>
     In the moonlight -- it looks exactly like his drawing.

     But no drawing could convey the size of the place -- we
     are looking at ten thousand square feet. Wealth and
     power.

     We're in rolling hill country.     The mansion is dark.
     Totally deserted. Silence.

     Now a sound - TIRES ON GRAVEL. A car comes rolling INTO
     VIEW. The motor of the car has been turned off. The
     lights of the car have been turned off. The car slides
     to a stop. Again, silence...

     HOLD ON mansion, a couple of hundred yards away.     There
     is a small field between the car and the estate.     Now --


<b>11   EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION/INT. LUTHER'S CAR - NIGHT                11
</b>
     A man holds binoculars, studying the place. He wears
     dark clothes, tennis shoes. He puts down the binoculars,
     begins to smear his face with black camouflage cream --

     -- it's Luther, and he's been a  professional thief his
     entire life. He's a three-time   loser, but his last
     sentence was so long ago and his  skills are now so vast,
     so refined, that it is unlikely  he will ever get caught
     again.


<b>12   EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - GROUNDS - NIGHT                        12
</b>
     The grounds as Luther glides through it.     He wears a
     backpack.

     The night is cool.

     He stops. All that separates him from the mansion now is
     a stretch of gorgeous lawn. Except for Luther, it isn't
     gorgeous -- it's no-man's land.

     One final check of his surroundings -- then he sets off,
     in graceful motion, long strides eating up the ground.
     He makes no sound at all.


<b>13   EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT                     13
</b>
     Thick wood with reinforced steel.

     Luther stops by the door, takes off his backpack, opens
     it. He puts on plastic gloves that have a special layer
     of padding at the fingertips and palms. Now he takes a
     key, inserts it in the front door, turns it, and the
     instant he pushes the door open -- ZOOM TO:
<b>
</b><b>                                                             5.
</b>
<b>14   INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - FOYER - NIGHT                        14
</b>
     The infrared SECURITY DETECTOR -- it immediately starts
     to BEEP and you can see the seconds being counted down:
     forty, thirty-nine, thirty --

<b>                                                CUT TO:

</b>
     -- in his hands now is an automatic screwdriver, no more
     than six inches long --

     -- he sets to work on the security panel that is inside
     in the foyer next to the front door.

     The screwdriver undoes the first screw, the second --

<b>                                                CUT TO:

</b>
     Now the third and fourth screws are in hands and he lifts
     the security panel away.

     The BEEPING sound is constant --

     -- and getting louder.

     A tiny device, no bigger than a pocket calculator. It
     has two wires protruding from it. It is, we are about to
     find out, a tiny computer. Luther holds it like a baby.

      The foyer as Luther, once again carrying his backpack,
      moves across it. Behind him, the front door is again
      shut, the security panel back on, screws all in place.

      It's as if he hadn't been there at all...

      Luther walks quickly up -- and here we get a sense of the
      vast size of the place -- it feels bigger inside than it
      looked in the moonlight.

      A Van Gogh at the head of the stairs. Luther moves past
      it, then stops, goes back, studies the painting. It's a
      late one, when the madness had him and things were
      sliding away. Very sad.

      Luther looks at it admiringly for another moment --

      -- then surprisingly he raises his hand,  and for just an
      instant traces the lines of the painting  in the air, as
      if trying to figure out how the magic was  done, as if
      getting ready for his next museum session  --

      -- then almost grudgingly, he moves on, up toward the
      third floor.

      Here's a Hopper. One of the great ones, filled with an
      overpowering sense of being alone --

      -- Luther stares at it almost in awe, whispers "wow,"
      moves on.

      Luther, walking down the third-floor corridor.

      The corridor walls. No paintings here -- instead we see
      a series of framed photographs. The first is of a baby
      girl, the next one of the same child at three.

      We watch the child grow up in these photos.    At ten she
      is already pretty. At fifteen a stunner.

      Not a classic beauty by any means, she is turning into,
      if you will a latter-day Ann-Margret. The kind of girl
      you ached for in high school. The perfect cheerleader.

      These are pictures, we will come to know, of Christy
      Sullivan. A high school graduation shot at eighteen, a
      shot in front of a Burger King at twenty.

      Christy, looking just fabulous, is 24 and smiling
      happily. We can only see her face and the wedding veil
      here. Now --

      PULL BACK to reveal --

      A glorious and expensive white wedding dress.    Christy
      holds a bouquet of flowers. Breathtaking.

      And now we can see the groom. Walter Sullivan. Walter
      is smiling too, one arm proudly around his lovely bride.

      Walter, it might be noted, is eighty years old.

      Luther, staring at the photo, shakes his head.    Now he
      moves on.

      Luther opens the DOOR. It SQUEAKS. He goes inside,
      closes the door firmly. Next, he puts his backpack down,
      takes out a low-power non-glare work light, sets it up.
      Now he looks around. A huge room, a gigantic canopied
      bed.

      A nightstand alongside, which contains a small silver
      clock, three Danielle Steel novels piled neatly one atop
      the other, several more photos of the happy couple --

      -- and an antique silver-plated letter opener with a
      thick leather handle.

      Luther. He studies himself in front of a very large
      full-length mirror across from the canopied bed.

      Now we realize something -- he isn't studying himself,
      he's studying the mirror itself.

      He turns, goes to the sitting area where there are chairs
      and a sofa and a large TV and VCR.

     Three remotes on a side table. Luther carefully picks up
     the middle one, crosses the room with it, points it at
     the large mirror, clicks once --

     -- and the mirror swings silently open.

     A room is revealed. All we can see of it so far is this:
     There is an armchair in the middle facing where the
     mirror had been.

     Luther turns back toward the sitting area, the remote
     held in his hand.

     The side table. Luther puts the remote down -- very
     carefully. In the exact position it had been. Now he
     takes a moment, blows on his hands, rubs them together.

     Then -- Luther takes a collapsible duffel bag out of his
     backpack, moves with the work light into the revealed
     room --


<b>30   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - VAULT - NIGHT                 30
</b>
     It's a vault! And it's FULL! There's cash, naturally,
     piles of the stuff. Plus all kinds of other valuables
     we'll get around to.

     Luther's a little stunned -- it's more than he hoped for.

     He glances at the armchair -- there is a remote on it
     that is identical to the one he replaced at the side
     table.

     Now he opens his duffel all the way and sets to work.
     First the cash goes in -- all neatly bundled. Large
     denominations. Lots of bundles. Next are a series of
     slender boxes --

     The first box as Luther opens it.

     Jewelry.

     Into the duffel it goes.

     Luther, emptying more jewelry boxes into the duffel.    And
     still more. As he continues to do this --

     All is quiet. High on a wall, the security light beams a
     friendly green.

     Now, from somewhere, a distant sound.   LAUGHTER?   Was it
     laughter? Doesn't matter, it's gone.

      Luther has moved deeper into it -- he's finished with the
      jewelry. Now he's examining piles of bonds.

      Into the duffel they go.

      He takes a breath, glances around.    Perfect.

      Coins.   Antique ones.   They disappear into the duffel.

      Stamp books.   Gone into the swelling duffel.

      Luther as he hears now the DISTANT LAUGHTER.     Not so
      perfect.

      He moves quickly out of the vault, takes a step toward
      the door -- the GIGGLING is getting LOUDER, closer. Two
      people. A man and a woman.

      Luther stops, mutters "shit!" -- glances around -- No
      place to hide. Luther, grabbing his backpack, moves into
      the vault, turns off his work light, and shuts the door
      with the remote. The DOOR CLICKS --

      -- Luther is alone in the darkness.

      A burst of LAUGHTER now.    Growing nearer still.

      Luther moves into the back of the vault, crouches down,
      doing his best to hide behind the armchair. Trapped,
      Luther waits in silence, trying not to breathe...

      Now he can hear a SQUEAK -- the BEDROOM DOOR has opened.

      the open bedroom door.

      Two people are briefly visible as they enter, a MAN and a

      The Woman closes the bedroom door.

      Darkness again.

     Luther as the burst of light hits him like a fist -- and
     it's over.

     Luther blinks, confused, looks around --

     -- because it isn't over, he hasn't been caught.

     The door to the vault is suddenly gone. Luther is
     staring straight into the goddamn bedroom.

     Because the door is a two way mirror. Now it's as if he
     was watching the bedroom on a giant TV screen.

     Just a few feet away, just outside the door.

     Where things are clearly starting to heat up.

     Luther moves to the armchair, sits.    There is nothing to
     do now but wait. He settles in.

     They are staring at each other.

     We have seen the woman already -- she's CHRISTY SULLIVAN.
     But the pictures in the corridor did not do her justice.

     This is a fabulous-looking twenty-five-year-old woman.
     Long, golden hair, a round face that sets off her deep
     blue eyes, a tanned, curving body. A bare-shouldered
     black dress. An expensive necklace.

     One more thing:   she is staggering drunk.

     The man is ALAN RICHMOND, wealthy, successful, handsome
     and fit. Mid-forties. He wears an elegantly-cut suit.

     Two additional points: (1) Richmond is clearly not the
     husband in the wedding photo. (2) He is drunker than she
     is.

     Richmond carries a vodka bottle and two tumblers.     He
     fills them, gives one to her.

     They touch glasses.    Down the hatch.   Tight laughter.

     He looks at her.

     She looks at him.    There's a lot of sexual tension in the
     air.

     But now he begins looking around, checking things out.
     She spots this.

     He nods then, more at ease.    And he blows her a kiss.

      as Richmond's hands move across her wondrous body and she
      is hot and drifting into drunken fantasy and her eyes
      close and --

      -- the look on his drunken face is scary.

      looking at him and he is smiling happily and looking at
      her, and whatever was on his face just before has gone.

      bed.

      The bed as they stop alongside it and kiss -- it's their
      first. And her arms go around his neck and she holds him
      like that, her eyes shut tight --


<b>62    INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                 62

      Luther -- watching because Richmond's eyes are not shut,
      they are wide open and they stare at the mirror and the
      awful look from before is back, only worse, and then
      without warning, he grips her buttocks roughly --

      -- and slaps her hard on the ass, over and over and
      Christy is shocked, surprised, pulls away. Richmond
      smiles at her sweetly.

      Christy.   Shaking her head.

      Richmond. He continues to smile, makes a courtly
      gesture, kissing her fingertips in apology.

     Christy. She smiles in acknowledgement and they move
     onto the bed. She pushes him down and straddles him.

     Richmond, from her POINT OF VIEW -- a wonderfully-
     handsome man.

     Christy, from his POINT OF VIEW. A glorious, vibrant
     young woman. She smiles, touches her lips to a finger,
     reaches out, touches the finger to his mouth.

     It's a sweet moment.

     They smile.

     Then he reaches up, and without a word, grabs her breasts
     and squeezes and twists them brutally and Christy is
     shocked and she tries to make him stop but he won't, and
     she cries out in pain but he still won't stop so she
     slaps him in the face. He slaps her back, viciously,
     right in the mouth and now there is blood mixing with her
     lipstick and she rolls off the bed onto the floor.

     Christy sits there stunned.

               You fucking bastard.

     And on that --

     Richmond, standing now, reaches down to help her up.
     Christy hesitates, finally takes his hand and as soon as
     she is on her feet --

     Christy, kicking him with all she has, in the stomach.

     Richmond, the air momentarily out of him,  falling
     drunkenly to the floor, stunned for just  a moment and
     clearly in pain, but he is a big man and  he is strong and
     he grabs her ankle, yanks, and then both  are laboring on
     the floor and Christy kicks him again and  again --

     -- but he will not release her ankle.   Each kick only
     inflames his drunken rage.

                  You little whore --

     And now they both try and stand.

     Neither one does it gracefully, neither one does it
     quickly, but Richmond gets there first and as soon as he
     is on his feet he begins to strangle her.

     Christy, gasping, terrified, she claws at his arms, her
     fingers scratching deeply --

     -- but he will not let go.

     She twists and jerks her body --

     -- no good -- he continues to tighten his grip on her
     throat --

     -- and spreads his legs for better balance.

     The bed table, as Christy, beyond desperation reaches
     around for something, anything -- her fingers finally
     close on the letter opener and in one wild stroke, she
     slashes his right arm.

     Now he lets go.    And stares, stunned, at his bleeding
     arm.

     Then he crunches her flush in the   mouth, a brutal blow,
     and blood pours from her nose and   mouth and if she
     weren't so scared, maybe it would   have stopped her, but
     it doesn't -- because somehow she   manages to maintain
     balance --

     -- and knees him all she has, in the nuts.

     It's over -- Richmond falls to the floor, helpless.       He
     lies on his back, holding his crotch.

     But it isn't over. Christy, blood pouring down her face,
     stands over him, the letter opener still tight in her
     hand.

     And in her eyes you can see it, the homicidal rage --

     -- and she drops to her knees beside him --

     -- and Richmond can only lie there, watching her --

     -- and she gets a better grip on the letter opener --

     -- and Richmond still only lies there, watching her --

     -- and she raises the letter opener slowly very high
     above her head, the point aimed at his heart --

     -- and Richmond screams one time --

     -- and as Christy starts to kill him, two well-dressed
     men in business suits burst through the bedroom doorway,
     GUNS in their hands, and they BLOW HER BRAINS OUT before
     the opener reaches Richmond's heart...

     -- he reels back in the chair, eyes wide, jaw slack,
     mouth open --

     -- this is a man who has seen everything but nothing has
     prepared him for this --

     Christy, fighting for another instant of life --

     -- no chance --

     -- the two bullets have shattered her brain, her eyes
     roll up into her head, the letter opener drops to the
     rug, she collapses like a rag doll --

     The two well-dressed men in business suits.

     BILL BURTON is the more formidable. Mid-40s, he looks
     like a retired tight end. No body fat. Intimidating.
     But right now he is shaking and he can't stop it. He
     puts his gun away, goes to Richmond.

     TIM COLLIN is closing in on 30. Handsome. In wonderful
     shape. Burton is more physical, Collin more lethal. He
     puts his gun away, goes to Christy.

     Richmond is trying to sit. He is as drunk as before but
     now he is also close to shock. He reaches over, manages
     to pick up the bloody letter opener.

</b>                  No choice in the matter.

     His words are efficient but clearly, he has been rocked.

     Richmond, staring stupidly at the letter opener. He
     drops it back to the floor, tries to stand, can't.
     Burton helps him back to the bed. Which is when he
     passes out cold.

     Burton and Collin look at each other now.

     GLORIA RUSSELL moving through the bedroom door.
     Russell's 40, well-dressed, attractive and very smart.
     Now she sees what's happened, stops dead.

     Now she moves forward, looks at Burton and Collin.    It's
     very clear from the outset: these three are not

     There is the sound of a VACUUM -- it's later now.

     The place is incredibly changed. Christy is lying as

     been made with clean sheets. There is a large black
     garbage bag that Collin shoves the sheets in, dumps in
     Christy's jewelry. Burton is VACUUMING the rug.

     Richmond is visible, still in terrible shape, finishing
     putting his clothes on in the open master bedroom.

     Russell's purse, snaps it shut, tucks it under one arm

     outside. Two dark Towncars are parked in the driveway.

     Burton is behind them, turning off all lights. Collin is
     last, with Russell's purse, the garbage bag. As he
     follows them outside, he closes the front door firmly --

      It's the next morning and Luther is back at the same old
      stand, looking at El Greco. The other art students are
      there too. So are the suburban housewives.

      Everything is as it was -- calm and peaceful --

      -- now a museum guard moves into the doorway, scanning
      the room.

      Luther -- a quick glance over, then back to his
      sketchbook -- and from that glance it's clear all is not
      calm and peaceful.

      The guard checks the room again.

      This is WALTER SULLIVAN, one of the giants of the era.    A

      enemies.

      At 80, his body may be betraying him -- he was once
      handsome -- but his mind is that of a young man.

      We've seen him before -- in the wedding picture on the
      wall of his mansion. With his young bride Christy.

      He is with her again now, at the morgue. A sheet covers
      her body. The toe tag is visible. Walter, shattered and
      desolate, stares at her once joyous face.

      term, a shoo-in for re-election when that ritual comes.

      He picks up speed.   Glances around -- no cars are

      Burton reaches into his pocket, takes out a MICRO-

      A stove with one burner on high.   A tea kettle is over
      the flame.

      It is morning and Kate is clearly not fully awake. She
      is finishing making instant coffee with lowfat milk and
      Sweet 'n Low; next she goes to the front door of her
      apartment, opens it, picks up the morning Washington
      Post.

      She unfolds the paper as she starts back to the
      kitchen --

      Kate looks at it only a moment, shakes her head, then
      starts to turn her attention to another section of the
      paper --

      -- she doesn't get that far.

      Kate:   she has seen something she didn't catch before --

      The front page again.    And the headline is still there --

      -- but there is a smaller headline beneath it:

                               Jewel Thief Sought

      Kate sits down hard. Trying for control.      Entering a
      nightmare. She stares at the paper.

      The front page. Pictures of the mansion, of Walter
      smiling on his wedding day, of Christy.

      But Kate's eyes keep coming back to the smaller headline:

                               Jewel Thief Sought

      She tries to sip coffee, spills. She closes her eyes --
      in the kitchen, the pot of WATER starts to SHRIEK. Kate
      does not move.

      Two people are present: Luther and VALERIE.      Valerie is
      very small, and doesn't miss much.

      She has been photographing him, and as the last photo

      Luther is deeply engrossed in his labors.

      Seth enters the room, casually taking it all in. He

      on getting the hands right.

      They walk in, go to  the food line. There is, throughout,
      a bantering tone.   Not that it matters, but these two, in

      in their own ways,  deeply moral men.

                          (as Seth nods)
                   There had to be an architect,
                   right? You'd be able to tell
                   which one from public records in
                   the library. And once you know
                   the office, you could break in and
                   find the plans and Xerox them, get
                   them back before morning.

      Luther by the bed now, he flashes his light around --

      -- what the light illuminates: a bed table full of law
      books. Expected. A phone/answering machine. The
      mandatory lamp.

      And photographs. A proud mother and daughter picture.
      The daughter is Kate. The mother is a fine-looking woman
      with a kind face.

      Half a dozen more shots as Kate grew up, the mother grew
      older. Mother and daughter, mother and daughter.

      heartsick and beaten. Luther is simply transfixed --

      -- Richmond on CNN and now he has turned and is beckoning
      for Walter Sullivan to join him.

      Sullivan for a moment is uncertain. He points to himself
      -- "do you mean me?" Richmond nods, opens his arms out
      wide. Sullivan gets up, comes forward.

      Luther, as he gets up too, also comes forward, leaving
      the stool, walking close to the television.

      Richmond and Sullivan, grainy on CNN as Richmond embraces
      Sullivan, holds him in a loving embrace.

      will, we are looking at dozens of photographs --

      -- all of them featuring Kate.

      Many of them we saw in her apartment -- only here, as in

      We've never seen Russell quite      like this -- relaxed,
