WILD AT HEART


                        W I L D  A T  H E A R T
                         a love story

                         written by
                         David Lynch

                     based on the book by
                         Barry Gifford



And now the story of Sailor and Lula.....




1. EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

A MAN rides a screaming massive Japanese motorcycle - wound out to 
maximum R.P.M. up the street.

                                        CUT TO:


2. SIGN BY ROADSIDE

The sign reads “KIDS PLAYING - SPEED BUMPS”.

                                        CUT TO:


3. EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

With a whine from hell, the front tire of the motorcycle hits a speed 
bump.

The motorcycle becomes airborne and on the way up slices itself in half 
as it scrapes along the full length of a Datsun Kingcab.

In the air, the rider and motorcycle twist violently as they fly by.

The motorcycle bounces off a black ’66 Chevrolet and makes a sound like 
the end of the world.

The rider hits the same Chevy a moment later.  Like a broken ragdoll 
shot from a canon, the man punches through the back window blowing glass 
for a block.  He stops somewhere under the front seat and a bubble of 
blood forms out his nose.

The motorcycle continues on sliding and spinning with an ear-piercing 
howl for one entire city block.

                                        CUT TO:


4. EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - VACANT LOT - DAY

Two rabid dogs fight ferociously in a vacant lot - ripping each other’s 
flesh.  An OLD COUPLE, both with walkers, inch painfully along nearby.

                    OLD WOMAN
          Oh my God! ... Why they doin’ that?

                    OLD MAN
          Who the hell knows.  What you have
          in your mouth?

The old woman begins to turn away, covering her mouth with her hand.

                    OLD MAN 
          Spit it out!!! ... Pull your teeth
          out ... doctor said.  What you 
          tryin’ to do?  SPIT IT OUT!!!

The Old Man grabs the Old Woman by the neck and squeezes.  Out comes a 
tangled and sticky ball of hard fruit candies.

                                        CUT TO:


5. WASP NEST

A thousand wasps hover threateningly in the air around the nest.  A 
SMALL GROUP OF HARDENED CRIMINAL NINE-YEAR OLDS sporting hideous grins, 
bat the nest violently to and fro with sticks.  One kid busies himself 
shooting a large can of Black Flag garden spray into a crack in the 
nest.  Another stomps half-dead wasps up and down the sidewalk.  All the 
kids are making animal noises of one sort or the other.

                                        CUT TO:


6. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

The telephone rings.  MARIETTA PACE FORTUNE, a rich Southern woman 
around fifty, carries her Martini and Rossi sweet vermouth drink across 
the livingroom and answers the phone.

                    MARIETTA
          Hello...  Who is this?...

                                        CUT TO:


7. INT. PEE DEE COUNTY WORK FARM - DAY

A GUARD stands by as SAILOR RIPLEY, twenty-three years old - lost 
somewhere between the cool long-gone generation and a used-car salesman 
- speaks on a prisoner phone in a green cement cubicle with one bench.

                    SAILOR
               (into phone)
          ...Sailor Ripley...  Can I talk 
          to Lula?

                                        CUT TO:


6A. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

                    MARIETTA
          There’s no way in hell you can speak
          to her and...

                                        CUT TO:


7A. INT. PEE DEE COUNTY WORK FARM - DAY

                    SAILOR
               (feeling a smile coming on)
          What?...

                                        CUT TO:


6B. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

                    MARIETTA
          ...Yes you heard me...  Don’t ever 
          call back here again.

Marietta hangs up the phone as LULA PACE FORTUNE, Marietta’s twenty-year 
old daughter, comes quickly down the stairs.

                    LULA
          Mama???

                    MARIETTA
          You know who it was and you know 
          you aren’t, and I mean ARE NOT 
          gonna see him EVER...  End of story.

                    LULA
               (quietly)
          Like hell.

Marietta, her hand still on the telephone, grips the receiver so hard 
her knuckles turn white.

                                        CUT TO:


8. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - LULA’S ROOM UPSTAIRS - DAY

Lula enters her room and cranks up her stereo.  Speed metal music jumps 
up to around one hundred twenty decibels.

                                        CUT TO:


9. INT. PEE DEE COUNTY WORK FARM - DAY

The guard escorts Sailor away from the telephone and back to his cell.  
The iron bars of the door slide across Sailor’s face and close with a 
bang.

                                        CUT TO:


10. EXT. THE MUSIC BAR - NIGHT

A beat-up, red ’64 Ford Falcon station wagon filled with insane 
TEENAGERS on speed and PCP race out of control down the street past the 
club - leaning out the car in every direction.  They scream out to the 
desolate-looking passerby.

                    TEENAGERS
          EAT SHIT MOTHERFUCKERS!!!!!!

The camera cranes up to the neon club sign and gets lost among the hot 
pink neon, the frantic moths and the intense electric buzz.

                                        CUT TO:


11. INT. THE MUSIC BAR - NIGHT

Lula and her friend, BEANY THORN, sit at a table drinking rum Coca-Colas 
while watching and listening to a white blues band called THE BLEACH 
BOYS.  The group segues smoothly from Elmore James’s “Dust my Broom” 
into Robert Johnson’s “Me and the Devil” and Beany lets out a snort.

                    BEANY
          I can dig this music...  But not 
          that singer.

                    LULA
          Why?...  He’s right in the groove.

                    BEANY
          He’s so ugly.  Guys with beards and
          beer guts ain’t quite my type.

                    LULA
                    (giggles)
          Seein’s how you’re about as thick as
          a used string of unwaxed dental floss,
          don’t know how you can criticize.

                    BEANY
          Yeah, well, if he says that all that
          flab turns into dick at midnight, 
          he’s a liar.

Lula and Beany laugh and swallow some of their drinks.

                    BEANY
          So, Sailor’s gettin’ out soon, and
          you’re gonna see him?

Lula nods and crushes an ice cube with her back teeth and chews it.

                    LULA
          Meetin’ him at the gate.  That phone
          call this afternoon was the signal.
          My deranged mama’s hid the keys to
          my car.  But of course, I know 
          exactly where they are.

                    BEANY
          I didn’t hate me so much, I’d feel
          better wishin’ you luck.

                    LULA
          Can’t all husbands be perfect, and
          your Elmo prob’ly wouldn’ta ever 
          got that second one pregnant, you
          hadn’t kicked his ass out.

                    BEANY
          So you’re gonna be needin’ the 
          “blue-bird” pretty soon?

                    LULA
          Real soon ... I’ll be makin’ the swap 
          tomorrow, and thanks again, Beany.

The Bleach Boys kick into some kind of Professor Longhair swamp mambo.

                                        CUT TO:


12. EXT. BAY ST. CLEMENT - DAY

Plumes of smoke from fires rise in the distance.

DISSOLVE TO:

An empty livingroom.  The smoke from the city fire appears during the

An empty hallway.

An empty stairway.


13A. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - MARIETTA’S BEDROOM - DAY

Feet (Lula’s) was across carpet.

15. EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

16. INT. BEANY THORN’S GARAGE - DAY

Lula throws her car keys under the front seat and goes around to Beany’s 
’67 dark blue Thunderbird convertible - fishes around under the T-Bird’s 
front seat for the keys - finds them - jumps in and takes off.

DISSOLVE TO:


17. EXT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

Marietta leaves her Cadillac Seville in her driveway and enters the 
house.  We can hear her calling out for Lula in the distance.  The 
calling changes - it becomes angry.  The garage door opens and Marietta 
comes storming out.  She leaps in her Caddy and peels out.

                                        CUT TO:


18. INT. “SOUTHERN TIME” BAR - DAY

Marietta enters the bar on the run.  She calls out to the BARTENDER...

                    MARIETTA
          Where’s Johnnie?  He’s not in his office.

                    BARTENDER
          Haven’t seen ’im yet today, Marietta.

                    MARIETTA
               (slightly hysterical)
          Well I gotta find him - right this
          minute!

                                        CUT TO:


19. EXT. PEE DEE COUNTY WORK FARM - DAY

Sailor is waiting out front as Lula pulls up in her T-Bird - throwing 
out a cloud of dust.  They’re both smiling.

                    LULA
          Hey baby...

                    SAILOR
          Peanut...

They kiss tenderly and then Sailor walks around the car to get in while 
Lula opens up a suitcase and gets out his snakeskin jacket.

                    SAILOR
          Hey, my snakeskin jacket...  Thanks,    
          baby...  Did I ever tell you that
          this here jacket for me is a symbol
          of my individuality and my belief
          in personal freedom?

                    LULA
          ’Bout fifty thousand times.  I got 
          us a room at the Cape Fear, and 
          guess what?...  I hear Powermad’s 
          at “The Hurricane.”

                    SAILOR
               (smiling)
          Stab it and steer.

Lula tromps it and throws out an even larger cloud of dust.

                                        CUT TO:


20. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY

Sailor and Lula lay on the bed in the Cape Fear Hotel listening to the 
fan creak.

                    LULA
          Did you ever think somethin’ like
          about the wicked witch of the east
          comin’ flyin’ in?...  Did you ever
          think somethin’ and then later think
          you’ve said it out loud to someone?

                    SAILOR
          I really did miss your mind while I
          was out at Pee Dee, honey.  The
          rest of you, too, of course.  But 
          the way your head works is God’s own
          private mystery.  What was it you
          was thinkin’?

                    LULA
          Well, I was thinkin’ about smokin’ 
          actually...  My mama smokes Marlboros
          now, used to be she smoked Kools?
          I stole ’em from her beginnin’ in
          about sixth grade.  When I got old
          enough to buy my own, I bought those.
          Now I’ve just about settled on Mores,
          as you probably noticed?  They’re longer.


                    SAILOR
          I guess I started smokin’ when I was
          about six...  My mama was already
          dead from lung cancer...

                    LULA
          What brand’d she smoke?

                    SAILOR
          Camels, same as me...  Guess both
          my mama and my daddy died of smoke
          or alcohol related illness.

                    LULA
          Gee, Sailor.  I’m sorry, honey.  I 
          never would have guessed it.

                    SAILOR
          It’s okay.  I hardly used to see 
          them anyway.  I didn’t have much 
          parental guiding.  The public defender
          kept sayin’ that at my parole hearin’.
          He was a good ol’ boy, stood by me...
          Even brought me some cartons of 
          cigarettes from time to time.

                    LULA
          I’d stand by you, Sailor ... through
          anything.

                    SAILOR
          Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after
          I planted Bob Ray Lemon.  A man can’t
          ask for more than that.

Lula pulls Sailor over to her and kisses him soft on the mouth.

                    LULA
          You move me, Sailor, you really do.
          You mark me the deepest.

Sailor pulls down the sheet, exposing Lula’s breasts.

                    SAILOR
          You’re perfect for me, too.

                    LULA
          You remind me of my daddy, you know?
          Mama told me he liked skinny women
          whose breasts were just a bit too
          big for their bodies.  He had a long
          nose, too, like theirs.  Did I ever
          tell you how he died?

                    SAILOR
          In a fire, as I recall.

                    LULA
          Started he couldn’t remember things?
          Got real violent?  Mama kept tellin’
          me it was on account of lead poisoning
          from cleanin’ the old paint off our
          house without usin’ a mask...  But
          I don’t know.  Seems like his brain
          just fell apart in pieces.

21. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

CLYDE FORTUNE tears a door off the kitchen cabinets and strews the 
cabinet contents all across the counter and floor.  He puts his fist 
through the kitchen window.  He leaps on the counter and bats the 
kitchen ceiling light - smashing it.  He kicks over the refrigerator.

                    CLYDE
          FUCKIN’ BITCH!!!!

                                        CUT TO:


22. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY

Lula’s eyes look off, remembering.

                    LULA
          Finally in the middle of the one 
          night, with me and mama asleep 
          upstairs ... he poured kerosene over
          himself and lit a match.

                                        CUT TO:


23. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - LIVINGROOM - NIGHT

Clyde Fortune, completely engulfed in fire, races across and back the 
livingroom until he collapses in a fifties modern armchair.  The drapes 
behind him burst in flames.

                    LULA
               (voice-over)
          Near burned down the house.  We 
          got out just in time.

The whole livingroom goes up in flames.

                                        CUT TO:


24. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY

CU the red hot ash of Lula’s cigarette as she inhales deeply.  As she 
exhales a cloud of smoke she turns to Sailor.

                    LULA
          It was a year before I met you.

Sailor takes the cigarette out of Lula’s hand and puts it into the 
ashtray by her bed.  He pulls her to him and kisses her throat.

                    SAILOR
          You have such a pretty, long neck, 
          like a swan.

                    LULA
          Grandmama Pace had a long, smooth
          white neck.  It was like on a 
          statue it was so white?

Sailor drifts his thumb over Lula’s left nipple then cups her breast in 
his hand.  They kiss.

                                        CUT TO:


25. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

Marietta pours JOHNNIE FARRAGUT another shot of scotch.

                    MARIETTA
          I knew this would happen.  Soon as
          that piece of filth got out of 
          Pee Dee, I knew there’d be trouble.
          He’s just got some kind of influence
          over her I can’t decipher.  There’s 
          somethin’ wild in Lula I don’t know
          where it comes from.  You gotta find
          ’em, Johnnie.

                    JOHNNIE
          He served his time for what he did.
          Another thing...  If Lula went with
          him of her own volition - willingly,
          that is - there ain’t much can be
          done about it.

                    MARIETTA
          Don’t talk down to me, Johnnie 
          Farragut.  I know what volition means,
          and that’s why I want Sailor Ripley
          off the planet!  He’s pure slime and 
          it’s leakin’ all over my baby.  
          Maybe you could push him into makin’
          some kinda move and then kill him
          dead.  You’d only be defendin’ 
          yourself, and with his record, 
          nobody’d fuss.

Johnnie pours himself another tumblerful of Walker Black Label.

                    JOHNNIE
          I’ll locate Lula, Marietta, and if
          she’s with the Ripley boy, I’ll
          give him a talkin’ to and try to
          convince her to come back with me.
          That’s about all I can do.

He takes a long swallow from the tumbler.  Marietta begins to cry.  She 
blubbers for a few seconds, and then stops as abruptly as she’d started.  
Her grey eyes glaze over.

                    MARIETTA
          I’ll hire a hit man if you don’t want
          to help me stop this thing.  I’ll
          call Marcello Santos.

                    JOHNNIE
          Now, Marietta, I am goin’ to help you.
          And don’t be gettin’ carried away.
          You don’t want to be bringin’ Santos
          and his people into it.

                    MARIETTA
          You’re just jealous of Santos cause
          he’s sweet on me.

          Well stop worryin’ about me and 
          start worryin’ about how you’re 
          gonna get that Lula back here and 
          away from that murderer.

                    JOHNNIE
          Sailor ain’t a murderer.  You got to
          get off that kick.  And far’s I can 
          tell, Sailor was entire clean prior
          to that involvin’ Lula.  Even there
          he was protectin’ her.  You oughta
          be thankin’ him for that.  That Bob
          Ray Lemon they say was comin’ after
          the both of ’em.  Why am I tellin’
          you this, you was around that night.
          You ought to know just exactly what
          happened.  Sailor just got a little
          too forceful is all...  You remember
          that night...

28. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY

Lula is standing in the bathroom of their room at the Hotel fooling with 
her hair in front of the mirror.  Sailor can see her through the doorway 
from where he lays on the bed.

                    LULA
          Sailor, you are somethin’ else, 
          honey...  When I was fifteen, Mama
          told me that pretty soon I’d be
          startin’ to think about sex, and
          I should talk to her before I did
          anything about it.

                    SAILOR
          But honey, I thought you told me
          your Uncle Pooch raped you when
          you was thirteen.

                    LULA
          That’s true.  Uncle Pooch wasn’t
          really an uncle.  He was a business
          partner of my daddy’s?  And my mama
          never knew nothin’ about me and 
          him - that’s for damn sure.  His real
          name was somethin’ kind of European,
          like Pucinski.  But everyone just
          called him Pooch.  He came around the
          house sometimes when Daddy was away.
          I always figured he was sweet on 
          mama, so when he cornered me one 
          afternoon, I was surprised more’n
          a little.

                    SAILOR
          How’d it happen, peanut?  He just
          pull out the old toad and let it
          croak?

Lula brushes away her bangs and frowns.  She takes a cigarette from the 
pack on the sink and lights it, then lets it dangle from her lips while 
she teases her hair.

                    LULA
          You’re terrible crude sometimes, 
          Sailor, you know?

                    SAILOR
          I can’t hardly understand you when
          you talk with one of them Mores in
          your mouth.

Lula takes a long, slow drag on her More and sets it down on the edge of 
the sink.

                    LULA
          I said you can be too crude sometimes?
          I don’t think I care for it.

                    SAILOR
          Sorry, sugar.  Go on and tell me how
          old Pooch done the deed.

                    LULA
          Well, mama was at the Busy Bee havin’
          her hair dyed?  And I was alone in 
          the house.

          Uncle Pooch came in the side door
          through the porch, you know?  Where
          I was makin’ a jelly and banana
          sandwich?  I remember I had my hair
          in curlers cause I was goin’ that
          night with Vicki and Cherry Ann, the
          DeSoto sisters.  Uncle Pooch must have
          known nobody but me was home, cause 
          he came right in and put both his
          hands on my butt and sorta shoved me
          up against the counter.

throws it into the toilet.

                    LULA

Lula flushes the toilet and watches the More come apart as it swirls 
down the hole.

          He was short but powerful.  With 
          hairy arms?  Anyway, he carried me 
          into the maid’s dayroom which nobody
          used.  We did it there on an old bed.

                    LULA
          Well, sure.  But he was super-gentle,
          you know?  I mean, he raped me and
          all, but I guess there’s all 
          different kinds of rapes.  I didn’t
          exactly want him to do it but I 
          suppose once it started, it didn’t
          seem all that terrible.  It was over 
          pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch
          just stood there and pulled up his
          trousers and left me there.  I 
          stayed in bed till I heard him drive
          off.  Then I just went back into
          the kitchen and finished makin’ my
          sandwich.

                    SAILOR
          And you never told nobody about it?

                    LULA
          Just you.  Uncle Pooch never acted
          strange or different after.  And he
          never did anything else to me.  I
          always got a nice present from him
          at Christmas, like a coat or jewelry?

          Uncle Pooch died in a car crash three

          too much traffic there for my taste...
          And another thing, baby...  That
          government of ours should be keepin’

          it.  One of these mornings the

Somewhere in the hotel a woman laughs.  It is a kind of wild, crazy 
laugh, and for the few seconds it lasts, Lula’s face goes pale.

36. INT. “THE HURRICANE” - A SPEED METAL CLUB - NIGHT

We see the sign which has all the letters tipped way over to the right - 
as if in a hurricane.  Two leaning palm trees border the sign.

One hundred decibels of speed metal.  We see the name “Powermad” on the 
bass drum.

The BAND segues into “Slaughter House” and it’s a hot one.  Sailor grabs 
Lula and they start dancing like two jacked-up spastics in an electrical 
storm.  a few PUNKS actually stop dancing to watch Sailor and Lula.  
They thought they’d seen everything.

CU of Lula and Sailor - they’re in love and dancing hot.  An IDIOT PUNK 
moves close to Lula and rubs up against her as he dances by.  Sailor 
turns to the lead guitar player and signals him to stop the music 
immediately.  Suddenly everything is deathly quiet.  Sailor gives the 
man a fully extended “Reno point”...

                    SAILOR
          Are you going to provide me with an 
          opportunity to prove my love to my
          girl?  Or are you gonna save 
          youself some trouble and step up 
          like a gentleman and apologize to her?

                    IDIOT PUNK
          Don’t fuck with me, man.  You look 
          like a clown in that stupid jacket.

                    SAILOR
          This is a snakeskin jacket, and for
          me it’s a symbol of my individuality
          and my belief in personal freedom.

                    IDIOT PUNK
          ...Asshole.

                    SAILOR

          Come here.

                    LULA
          Sailor, honey...

The Idiot Punk tries to hit Sailor, but Sailor slaps him so hard his 
knees almost bend backwards.  The Idiot Punk goes down - fighting back 
tears and holding his cheek.

                    SAILOR
               (helping him up)
          I’m sorry to do this to ya here 
          in front of a crowd, but I want ya
          to stand up and make a nice apology
          to my girl.

                    IDIOT PUNK
               (to Lula)
          I’m sorry.

                    LULA
          Hell, you just rubbed up against

          You fellas have alotta the same power
          Elvis had...  Y’all know this one?...

Sailor starts to sing an Elvis Presley song, “Love Me.”  As the band 
joins in with a perfect back-up - Sailor sings to Lula.  The Speed Metal 
crowd is mesmerized.

          Why didn’t ya sing “Love Me Tender”?

Sailor turns around from his sprawled on the bed position watching The

Lula slides her head up and kisses Sailor on the cheek.

Sailor and Lula are in bed.  Lula lays in Sailor’s arms.

          At Pee Dee, all you think about is 
          the future, you know?  Gettin’ out?
          And what you’ll do and what you’ll

          It ain’t altogether terrible just to
          let things go along sometimes.
          Lula, I done a few things in my life
          I ain’t too proud of, but I’ll tell
          ya from now on I ain’t gonna do

She starts trying to French kiss Sailor when an OLD MAN comes in to 
urinate and Sailor and Marietta freeze - in a kiss.  Sailor is going 
crazy in one way (wishing this wasn’t happening.)  Marietta is going 
crazy in another.  The man finishes and as he leaves...

          So?

          So maybe one night you got a little
          too close to the fire...  And you’re
          gonna get burned, baby...  And 
          besides that, you’re shit...  D’you
          think I’d let my little girl go with
          shit like you?...  Why, you belong
          right here in one of these toilets.

                    SAILOR
          You’re gonna have to kill me to keep
          me away from Lula.

          that drugstore by the restaurant in
          Biloxi?  I saw ’em by the register
          and the girl throw ’em in.  I’m
          not big on resistin’.  So what about
          a leech?

                    SAILOR
          Heard on the radio how doctors is
          usin’ leeches again, just in old
          times.  You know, when even barbers
          used ’em?

                    LULA
               (shuddering)
          I got one on me at Lake Lanier.  
          Lifeguard poured salt on it and it
          dropped off.  Felt awful.  He was a
          cute boy, though, so it was almost
          worth it.

Sailor laughs.

                    SAILOR
          Yeah, well listen to this...  Radio
          said back in the 1920s a I-talian 
          doctor figured out that if, say, a
          fella got his nose cut off or bit
          off in, say, a barfight or somethin’,
          they’d sew one of his forearms to his
          nose for a few weeks...  Then put
          leeches on it.

          How they used to do it.  Course they

          Radio said the Chinese, I think it
          is, figured a better idea is by
          insertin’ a balloon in the forehead
          and lettin’ it hand down on the nose.

Lula shrieks.

Sailor and Lula pass a sign that reads “NEW ORLEANS - 26 MILES”.  Sailor 
pulls off the road into a Gulf gas station mini-mart and stops the car 
next to a self-serve pump.  A sign on the top of it says “PLEASE PAY 
INSIDE BEFORE FUELING.”

74. INT. MINI-MART - DAY

A tall OLD BLACK MAN about seventy years old, wearing a torn green 
Tulane tee-shirt and a dirty orange Saints baseball cap, is filing items 
on the counter by the cash register.  In the pile are four ready-made, 
plastic-wrapped sandwiches, two tuna salad and two cotto salami; six 
Twinkies; a package of Chips Ahoy chocolate chip cookies; four Slice 
colas; two Barq’s root beers; and a large package of fried pork rinds, 
extra salted.

                    BLACK MAN
              (to Sailor and another guy 
              also waiting to pay for gas)
          Sorry, gentlemen.  I’m ’most finished
          on my shoppin’ here.

                    ERV
          This be it?

                    BLACK MAN
          Y’all take American Express?

                    ERV
          Yessir.

                    BLACK MAN
          Then lemme throw in a couple more
          things.

Sailor and the man in line behind him watch as the black man gathers up 
several more packages of Twinkies along with a few cupcakes and half a 
dozen cans of Pretty Kitty cat food, three liver and three chicken 
dinner portions, and tosses them on his pile.

                    BLACK MAN
             (to Sailor, smiling - showing 
              no visible upper teeth)
          Pussycats gotta eat, too.

He hands an American Express card to the clerk, ERV, who runs it through 
the verifier.  The card checks out okay and the old guy prepares a 
charge slip, has the man sign it, and bags the purchases.

                    BLACK MAN
               (to Erv)
          I’d just soon have a paper bag 
          rather than a plastic one, if it’s
          same to you.

                    ERV
            (shoving the plastic bag he
             filled towards the black man)
          We don’t have no paper bags.

A telephone begins to ring and everyone looks around.  The Black Man 
reaches in his jacket pocket and pulls out a portable phone and punches 
“send.”

                    BLACK MAN
               (into phone)
          Hello...  Yeah, mama, I’m on my 
          way...
               (to Sailor and other guy
             as he picks up his bag
               and heads out)
          Thanks for waitin’, gentlemen.

Everyone is silent as they watch the old Black Man hobble out.

                    SAILOR
               (to Erv)
          All I want’s ten bucks regular.
          Oh yeah, and a Mounds bar.

Erv takes one off the candy and gum rack next to the register and lays 
it on the counter.  Sailor gives him a twenty dollar bill.

                    SAILOR
          I ain’t got my American Express card
          with me, so I gotta use cash.  Hope
          that’s okay.

Sailor smiles, but the clerk keeps a poker face and just gives him his 
change.  The guy in line behind Sailor shakes his head and grins.

Sailor goes back to the car.

                    LULA

Sailor tosses her the candy bar.

                    SAILOR
          I really do think the country done
          changed just a little while I was

Lula sinks her small white teeth into the chocolate-covered coconut.

At a table near the window, Johnnie takes a man-sized pull off his Dixie 
beer in between bites of an oyster sandwich.  A large, chocolate-colored 
man in his early thirties, REGINALD SAN PEDRO SULA, and a smaller white 
man, DROP SHADOW approach with their trays of food.

                    REGGIE
          Do you mind if we share this table?
          ...  The others, they are occupied.

Johnnie looks around - sees that there are quite a few empty tables - he 
looks the men over quickly.

                    JOHNNIE
               (cautiously)
          Alright...  By all means.  Make 
          yourselves at home.

          But please do call me Reggie.  This
          is my friend, who we call Drop
          Shadow.  He is always with me.

Johnnie wipes off his right hand on his napkin and shakes.

                    JOHNNIE
          Johnnie Farragut.  Pleased to meet ya.

Reggie and Drop Shadow begin eating ferociously, finishing half of their 
meal before saying anything more.

                    REGGIE
          You are from New Orleans, Senor 
          Farragut?

                    JOHNNIE
          Johnnie, please.  Nope.  Charlotte,
          North Carolina.  Here on business.

Reggie smiles broadly, revealing numerous tall, gold teeth.

                    DROP SHADOW
          Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras.

                    REGGIE
          Do you know Honduras, Johnny?

                    JOHNNIE
          Only that it’s supposed to be a 
          pretty poor sight since the hurricane
          came through last year.

                    REGGIE
          Yes, that’s so.  But there is not 
          much to destroy.

                    DROP SHADOW
          No big buildings like in New Orleans.

                    JOHNNIE

                    REGGIE

          Oh, many things...

                    DROP SHADOW
          Mr. San Pedro Sula’s got an appliance
          shop.

                    REGGIE
          But I am also with the government.

Johnnie takes a bite of his oyster sandwich.

                    JOHNNIE
          In what capacity?

                    REGGIE
          In many capacities.

                    DROP SHADOW
          Mr. San Pedro Sula is with the 
          Secret Service.

Reggie reaches into his back pocket and takes out his wallet.  He hands 
a card to Johnnie.

                    JOHNNIE
               (reading aloud)
          General Osvaldo Tamarindo y Ramirez.
          Telefono 666.

                    REGGIE
          He is my sponsor.  The General is
          the head of the secret police of
          Honduras.

                    DROP SHADOW
          Mr. San Pedro Sula is one of his
          operatives.

Johnnie hands the card back to Reggie and Reggie gives him a small piece 
of paper, folded once.  Johnnie unfolds it.  The printing is in Spanish.

                    REGGIE
          That is my permiso.

                    DROP SHADOW
          Mr. San Pedro Sula’s permit to kill.

                    REGGIE
          Only if necessary, of course, and
          only in my own country.
               (laughs)

                    JOHNNIE
          Of course.

Johnnie refolds the piece of paper and hands it over to Reggie.

                    DROP SHADOW
          Mr. San Pedro Sula’s authorized to
          carry a .45.

          United States Marine issue, before
          they made the unfortunate switch to
          the less dependable nine millimeters.
          I have it here, in my briefcase.

Reggie holds up his stainless steel briefcase and then replaces it on 
the floor beneath his chair.

                    JOHNNIE
          Why are you in New Orleans?  If you 
          don’t mind my askin’.

                    REGGIE
          Certainly not.  We are here only
          briefly, in fact, until this evening,
          when we fly to Austin, Texas to visit
          a friend of mine who is an agent for
          the CIA.

                    DROP SHADOW
          He wants to take Mr. San Pedro Sula
          and me bass fishing.

                    REGGIE
          We are in the same businesses and
          also we are fishermen.

Johnnie swallows the last of his beer and stands up to leave.

                    JOHNNIE
               (extending his hand)
          It’s been a real pleasure.  I wish
          you both buena suerte wherever you go.

Reggie and Drop Shadow stand up.  They shake Johnnie’s hand.

                    REGGIE
          The same to you.  If you are in 
          Honduras, come to the Bay Islands and
          visit us.  The Hondurans are great
          friends of the American people.  But
          I have a joke for you before I go.
          If a liberal, a socialist, and a 
          communist all jumped off the roof of
          the Empire State Building at the 
          same time, which one of them would
          hit the ground first?

                    JOHNNIE
          I couldn’t say, which one?

Reggie turns to Drop Shadow and lets him have the punch line.

                    SAILOR
          If your neighbors didn’t mind, 
          how’d you get put out of business?

                    GEORGE
          Woman drivin’ down the street spotted
          me with on a roof with my rifle.  She
          called the police and they came over
          and arrested me.  Thought I was a
          sniper!  Boys at the VFW loved that
          one.  Cops didn’t understand about
          the pigeons, the damage they do to
          personal property.  I used to complain
          to the city but they never lifted
          a finger.  I was gonna put out poison,
          but I was afraid somebody’s cat 
          would eat it.  Hell, I had six cats
          myself.  So I used the .22 because
          it didn’t make much noise and the
          ammo was cheap.

                    SAILOR
          What happened on the charges?

                    GEORGE
          Guilty on a reduced charge.  Hundred
          dollar fine and ordered to desist.
          Pigeons carry diseases and muss up
          the place.  You seen it.  Plain filth.

Kovich stands up and puts some money on the counter.

                    GEORGE
          It’s a serious situation.  Not like
          the Turks and the Armenians, maybe,
          or the Arabs and the Jews, but I
          want people to remember me and what
          I’ve done and pick up where I left
          off.  Somebody had to make a move.
          It was nice meetin’ you folks.

George Kovich nods and leaves.

                    SAILOR
          What lesson do get outta that story,
          Lula?

                    LULA
          It’s just another case, Sailor.

                    SAILOR
          What’s that, peanut?

                    LULA
          One person thinks he’s doin’ somethin’
          good and ever’body else gets upset
          about it.

Sailor looks up at Lula.

                    SAILOR

85. INT. HOTEL BRAZIL - NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT

It’s very quiet in the hotel room and the clock says four a.m.  Lula and 
Sailor are lying in bed arm in arm.  Sailor is fast asleep - snoring.  
Lula is wide awake.

                    LULA
          Sailor?...  Sailor, honey?

Sailor snaps awake with a snort.

                    SAILOR
          Huh?

                    LULA
          Ever imagine what it’d be like to
          get eaten alive by a wild beast?...
          Sometimes I think it would be the
          biggest thrill?

                    SAILOR
          My God,
               (looks around)
          it better be, darlin’, cause it’d be
          the last...  What time is it?

          Shhhhh...  It’s four o’clock... 
          That woman’s laugh the other day had
          somethin’ to do with this feelin’?
          ...  Like bein’ ripped apart by a
          gorilla, maybe...  Grabbed sudden 
          and pulled apart real quick by a 
          real powerful one.

Lula’s left hand opens and spreads wide.

                    SAILOR
          Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you
          come up with some weird thoughts...

                    LULA
          Anythin’ interestin’ in the world
          come out of somebody’s weird thoughts,
          Sailor.  You tell me Sailor, who
          could come up with shit like we’re
          seein’ these days?

                    SAILOR
          You got me, peanut.

                    LULA
               (smiles - turns to him)
          You certain?

                    SAILOR
          I ain’t never met anyone come close
          to you, sugar.


                    LULA
          Recall the time we was sittin’ one
          night behind the Confederate soldier?
          Leanin’ against it.  And you took
          your hand and put it on your heart
          and you said, ‘You feel it beatin’ 
          in there, Lula?...  Get used to it,
          cause it belongs to you now.’  D’you
          recall that?

                    SAILOR
          I do.

                    LULA
          I was hopin’ you would.  I know that
          night by heart.  Sometimes, honey?
          I think it’s the best night of 
          my life.

          night of my life.

                    SAILOR
          We didn’t do nothin’ special I can
          remember.  Just talked, is all.

                    LULA
          Talkin’s good.  Long as you got the
          other?  I’m a big believer in talkin’,
          case you ain’t noticed.

                    SAILOR
          Too bad they don’t give an award for
          talkin’...  You’d win first prize.
          Especially with those tits.

                    LULA
          You think so, baby?  Does my talkin’

                    SAILOR
          No, I like gettin’ up around four
          a.m. and talkin’ bout wild animals
          ...  Though you woke me up this time
          in the middle of a dream.  I kinda
          wish I didn’t remember it.  Up at 
          Pee Dee, I couldn’t remember any of
          my dreams.

          What was this one?

                    SAILOR
          It wasn’t no fun, Lula.  The wind
          was blowin’ super-hard and I wasn’t
          dressed warm.  Only instead of
          freezin’, I was sweatin’ strong.

          He’s just a regular guy’t needs help,
          honey.  Look at him.

The HITCHHIKER is a man about thirty with a pack on his back, and he is 
carrying a large, covered cardboard box.  He is filthy, with an uneven 
smile that exposes his jagged yellow teeth.  Lula opens the door for 
him, and after he loads his stuff, Sailor takes off down the highway.

Roach slides the top off and tilts the box slightly toward the front.  
Inside are six small husky pups that are not more than two weeks old.

          Why you goin’ to Alaska?  And where’d
          you get them puppies?  They look sick.

Roach stares down into the box at the baby huskies and strokes each of 
them twice with a religiously unwashed hand.  The dogs whimper and lick 
his dirty fingers.

          at the pound.  Nobody wanted ’em, 
          ha-ha!  Ever’body here got theirself
          pit bulls or some kinda hounds.  I’m
          gonna feed these boys good so they’ll
          be big and powerful and they can pull
          me real fast through the snow, ha-ha!

Roach pulls a piece of raw cow’s liver out of one of his pockets of his 
field jacket and begins ripping little bits off it and feeding them to 
the dogs.

                    LULA
            (screeches as she sees this)
          Sailor!  Stop!  Stop the car now!

Sailor pulls off the road onto the shoulder of the highway and stops.  
Lula opens her door and jumps out.

                    LULA
          I’m sorry, but I can’t take this.  
          Roach, or whatever your name is, you
          come out of there with them dogs
          this instant!

Roach sticks the liver back in his pocket and pulls his pack and the box 
of tiny canines after him.  Once he and his belongings are deposited on 
the roadside, Lula hops back in the car and slams the door.

                    LULA
          I’m truly sorry?  I’m truly sorry, 
          Roach.  But ain’t gonna make it to
          Alaska?  Least not any part of the 
          way with us.  You’d best find a 
          party to take care of those dogs 
          proper, before they all die?  And, 
          if you don’t mind my sayin’ so?  You
          could most certainly use some serious
          lookin’ after yourself, startin’ with
          a bath!

Lula takes a pair of sunglasses off the dashboard and puts them on.

                    LULA
          Drive.

Sailor takes off.

                    SAILOR
          You don’t feel you was a little hard
          on the guy, honey?

                    LULA
          I know you’re thinkin’ that I got
          more’n some of my mama in me?  Well,
          I couldn’t help it.  Sailor, I really
          couldn’t.  I’m sorry for that guy,
          but when he pulled that drippin’ hunk
          of awful-smellin’ meat out of his
          pocket?  I near barfed.  And them 
          poor diseased puppies!

                    SAILOR
               (laughs)
          Just part of life on the road, peanut.

                    LULA
          Do me a favor, Sailor?  Don’t pick up
          no more hitchers, okay?

95. INT. INEZ’S FAIS-DODO BAR - NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT/
95A. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - MARIETTA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Johnnie is seated in a telephone booth at the back of the bar.

                    JOHNNIE
          No, Marietta, I haven’t found ’em.

                    MARIETTA
          This is the kinda mistake can take
          a Hindu’s lifetime to unfix...  
          You better get a move on, Johnnie, 
          before that boy got her holdin’ down
          a Memphis streetcorner and shootin’
          dope up her arms.

We see Reggie and Drop Shadow enter the bar.  Reggie’s unsmiling eyes 
drift across the room until they see Johnnie in the booth.  He stares 
coldly and waits.  Drop Shadow adjusts his socks.

                    JOHNNIE
          Really, Marietta, you got more 
          scenarios swimmin’ around in your
          brain than Carter got pills.  Try
          to take it easy.  Go over to Myrtle
          Beach for a few days.

                    MARIETTA
          I’m stayin’ right here by the phone
          until you find Lula, then I’m comin’
          to get her.  You call soon’s you got
          somethin’, even if it’s three in the
          a.m.

                    JOHNNIE
          I will, Marietta.  Goodbye now.

Johnnie hangs up the phone and exits the booth.  As he crosses the 
bar...

                    REGGIE
               (shouting)
          Hola!  Senor Farragut!  We meet again.  

Johnnie goes over to Reggie and Drop Shadow and shakes hands.

                    JOHNNIE
          I thought you two were in Austin, 
          Texas.  Or Takes-us, as they say in
          these parts.

                    DROP SHADOW
          We were.  Now Mr. San Pedro Sula and
          I are on our way back to Utila, in
          the morning.

                    REGGIE
          Would you like to enjoy a martini 
          with us?

                    JOHNNIE
          Why not?  How was the fishin’?

                    REGGIE
          I think they are too serious, these
          American fishermen.  In Honduras, we
          are not so concerned with the method.

Reggie orders martinis for the three of them.

                    JOHNNIE
          So, it’s back to the islands.

                    DROP SHADOW
          Yes.  Mr. San Pedro Sula spoke 
          yesterday to his son, Archibald Leach
          San Pedro Sula, who is named after
          Cary Grant, and he told them there
          was a shooting.

                    REGGIE
          Teddy Roosevelt, one of the local
          shrimp boat captains is in jail now.
          These people are friends of mine, so
          I must return and find out what 
          happened.

                    JOHNNIE
          This island of yours sounds like a 
          kind of unpredictable place.  

                    REGGIE
               (laughs)
          It has its moments of uncertainty.

                    DROP SHADOW
          But how are you finding New Orleans,
          Senor Farragut?

                    JOHNNIE
          Call me Johnnie...  N.O. has always
          been a good town to sit around in.


                    REGGIE
          I can tell you are an intelligent
          man, Johnnie.  One difference between
          your country and mine is that in the
          islands, it does not pay to reveal
          one’s intelligence...  Others may use
          what they perceive against us...

Reggie raises his glass to Johnnie’s.

                    REGGIE
          Hasta siempre.

                    JOHNNIE
          Hasta siempre.

                    REGGIE
          Do you know how it came about that
          copper wire was invented in Scotland?

                    JOHNNIE
          How’s that?

                    DROP SHADOW
          Two Scotsmen were fighting over a 
          penny.

Johnnie finishes off his martini.

                    JOHNNIE
          I gotta admit, you guys are
               (sliding off the stool)
          two in four dozen.

                    REGGIE
          The real joke is we never went fishing,
          but we’re still fishing.

Johnnie squints his eyes thinking about this one.  Reggie and Drop 
Shadow smile and stand to leave.

96. INT. THUNDERBIRD - STREETS OF NUNEZ - NIGHT

Lula and Sailor cruise the dark streets.

                    LULA
          I wouldn’t mind a little night life.
          How about you?

                    SAILOR
          Hard to tell what’s shakin’ in a 
          place like this, honey.  You don’t
          want to be walkin’ in the wrong door.

                    LULA
          Maybe there’s a place we could hear
          some music.  I feel like dancin’.
          We could ask someone.


97. EXT. RED DEVIL GAS STATION - NIGHT

Sailor spots a Red Devil gas station that still has its lights on and 
pulls the car over.

                    SAILOR
          Someone up here might know somethin’.

Two skinny, pimply-faced guys, BUCK and BILLY, wearing dirty coveralls 
walk over to them.

                    BUCK
          Gas?

                    SAILOR
          Got enough, thanks.  We’re lookin’
          for a place has some music, where we
          can maybe do some dancin’ - get 
          somethin’ to eat, too.  Anything like
          that around here?

                    BILLY
          Cornbread’s.  They got western.

                    BUCK
          No food, though, ’cept bar nibbles.

Lula slides over in the front seat and leans across to Sailor.

                    LULA
          How about speed metal?

The kids look worried and take a step back.

                    LULA
          Any kinda rock’n’roll, honey.

                    BILLY
          There’s a boogie joint just about a
          mile straight out Lafitte here.  But
          that’s a black place mostly.

                    BUCK
          Mostly black though in that boogie
          place.

                    SAILOR
          What’s the name of it?

                    BUCK
          Club Zanzibar.

                    SAILOR
          You say it’s straight ahead a mile?

                    BUCK
          About.  Where Lafitte crosses over
          Galvez Highway.  State Road 86.

                    SAILOR
          Thanks.

Sailor and Lula drive off.  Buck and Billy go back inside the Red Devil 
station.  Guess who is over the corner cleaning nuts and bolts with a 
toothbrush and gasoline ... It’s DELL!

98. EXT. CLUB ZANZIBAR - NIGHT

The Club Zanzibar sits in the darkness on the left hand side of the 
road.  A string of multi-colored lights is hung over the front.  Sailor 
parks the Thunderbird across from the club and cuts the engine.

                    SAILOR
          You ready for this?

                    LULA
          We’ll find out in a hurry.

99. INT. CLUB ZANZIBAR - NIGHT

When they walk in, the BAND is playing a slow blues and THREE OR FOUR 
COUPLES are swaying on the dance floor.  There are a dozen tables and a 
long bar in the room which is done up in a strange dark azquatic motif.  
Eight of the tables are occupied and SIX OR SEVEN MEN stand at the bar.  
Everyone in the place is black except for one WHITE WOMAN who is sitting 
alone at a table smoking a cigarette and drinking Pearl straight from 
the bottle.  The atmosphere is not friendly, but Lula takes Sailor by 
the arm.

                    LULA
          Come on.

They step up to the bar and order two Lone Star beers.  The BARTENDER, a 
tall, heavyset man slowly forms his hand into “the bird.”  He holds his 
hand that way while he speaks...

BARTENDER ZANZIBAR
          This is a friendly place, son.  You 
          folks just relax and have a nice time.

                    LULA
             (bound and determined not 
              to be intimidated)
          You got yourself a deal.

                    BARTENDER
               (to Sailor)
          That’s a real jacket...  By that,
          I mean a real stupid jacket.

                    SAILOR
          This is a snakeskin jacket, and for
          me it represents a symbol of my 
          individuality and my belief in
          personal freedom.

                    BARTENDER
          Fuckin’ honky cracker mumbo jumbo.


The bartender moves on down the bar.  Lula and Sailor take a small table 
near the door.

                    LULA
          I’ll be damned if I’m leavin’.  That
          band is too good?

                    SAILOR
          Uh huh.

                    LULA
          You notice that woman when we come
          in?  The white woman sittin’ by 
          herself?

                    SAILOR
          Yeah.

                    LULA
          Well, she ain’t talked to nobody 
          and ain’t nobody spoke to her that
          I could tell.  What you make of that?

                    SAILOR
          Honey, we bein’ strangers here and 
          all, this is the kinda place we don’t
          want to make nothin’ of nothin’.

                    LULA
          You think she’s pretty?

Sailor looks at the woman.  She lights a new cigarette off a butt, then 
squashes the butt in the ashtray.  She is thirty years old, maybe more.  
Shoulder-length, bleached blonde hair, black at the roots.  Clear skin, 
green eyes.  Long, straight nose with a small bump on it.  She is 
wearing a low-cut lavender dress that would have emphasized her breasts 
had she not been so flat-chested.  Slender.

                    SAILOR
          I tend to like ’em with a little 
          more meat on the bones.  Face ain’t
          bad, though.

Lula gets quiet and sucks on her beer bottle.

                    SAILOR
          What’s wrong, sweetheart?  Somethin’
          botherin’ you?

                    LULA
          Mama.  I been thinkin’ about her.
          She’s prob’ly worried to death by now.

                    SAILOR
          More’n likely.

                    LULA
          I want to call her and tell her
          I’m okay.  That we’re okay.

                    SAILOR
          I ain’t so sure it’s a great idea,
          but that’s up to you.  Just don’t tell
          her where we are.

                    LULA
               (to Bartender)
          Pardon me?  Y’all got a phone here 
          I can use?

BARTENDER ZANZIBAR
          Can’t you read?

                    LULA
               (sees the sign -
                 then to Sailor)
          Back in a bit.

She kisses him on the nose and walks back through a dark little door to 
the payphone.

dance floor.  Lula sees them, goes over to the bar, picks up a beer 
bottle and throws it at Sailor.  The bottle bounces hard off his back 
and clangs to the floor, bouncing but not breaking.  Sailor turns around 
fast and looks at Lula.  Everybody else in the place is still.


103. EXT. CLUB ZANZIBAR - NIGHT

Lula runs out.  Sailor follows.

Sailor finds her sitting on the ground, leaning against the passenger 
side of the Thunderbird.  Lula’s eyes are red and wet but she isn’t 
crying.  Sailor kneels down next to her.

                    SAILOR
          I was just wastin’ time, peanut, 
          till you come back.

                    LULA
          It’s me who’s wastin’ time, Sailor,
          bein’ with you.

                    SAILOR
          Honey, I’m sorry.  It wasn’t nothin’.
          Come on and get up and we’ll take
          off.

                    LULA
          Leave me be for a minute?  Mama gets
          all insane and then I see you 
          practicin’ your individuality and
          personal freedom with some oil-town
          tramp.  How you figure I’m gonna feel?

                    SAILOR
          Told you not to call your mama.

Sailor stands and leans against the hood of the car until Lula gets up 
and climbs inside.  He wraps his snakeskin jacket around her and starts 
the car.  Lula kisses Sailor on the cheek, puts her head down sideways 
on his lap and goes to sleep.  Sailor drives.

          I got some news, Marietta.  Lula
          and Sailor been here.  They checked
          out of the Hotel Brazil on Frechman
          Street yesterday.

                    MARIETTA
          Listen, Johnnie, Lula just called
          me.  She knew you were in N.O., so
          they left the city.

                    JOHNNIE
          Did she tell you where she was
          callin’ from?

                    MARIETTA
          No, but my guess is they’re headed
          west, so prob’ly Texas.  Their money
          must be runnin’ low.  I don’t think
          Sailor had much to begin with, if
          any, and Lula took the six hundred
          she had saved in the Cherokee Thrift.

          How’d she sound?  Was she doin’ okay?

                    MARIETTA
          Could she be doin’ okay, Johnnie?
          She’s tryin’ to prove somethin’ to

          Marietta, I was just gonna leave and
          see if I could pick up their trail.

          No, you wait right there for me...
          I’ll be on the Piedmont flight
          tomorrow at seven.  Meet me at

107. EXT. SHELL STATION - HOUSTON - DAY

Sailor and Lula are in a Shell station just outside of Houston.  Sailor 
is filling the Thunderbird with regular.  An OLD MAN sits near the pumps 
listening to the radio playing a sad big band tune.  Lula starts to 
slowly snap her fingers to the beat and the old man gives her a 
beautiful smile.

                    LULA
            (smiling and snapping her
             fingers)
          How much we got left, honey?

                    SAILOR
          Under a hundred.

                    LULA
          You want to stick around here, Sailor?
          See if we can get some work?

                    SAILOR
          Not in Houston.  We’d be better off
          in some place more out of the way.

                    LULA
          You want me to drive for a stretch?
          Give you a chance to rest.

                    SAILOR
          That’d be good, Lula.

Sailor kisses her and climbs into the back seat and lays down.  Lula 
slides behind the wheel and lights up a More.  She winks goodbye to the 
old man and wheels the car out towards the big beyond.

his pocket and takes out a silver dollar - flips it in the air - catches 
it - and puts it back in his pocket.  Mr. Reindeer smiles and waves him

dark figure follows out the window.

117. INT. MAISON VIOLETTE - LOBBY - NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT

Marietta is sitting in the lobby trying to hold herself together - half-
sobbing.  The MANAGER approaches and sits next to her.

                    MANAGER
          I’m afraid his car is gone, Mrs.
          Fortune.

                    MARIETTA
          I don’t understand this...  I don’t
          understand this one bit.  He was 
          supposed to meet me right her in 
          this lobby.  Somethin’ bad has 
          happened - I jus know it.

                    MANAGER
          Perhaps we should call a local law
          enforcement officer.

                    MARIETTA
          HELL NO!!!  That’s the last thing 
          we need...  A buncha cops runnin’
          around.

The front desk clerk steps from behind his desk and hurries into the 
lobby.

                    DESK CLERK
          I’m sorry...  But I have overlooked
          this.  I’m truly sorry, ma’am.

He hands Marietta a note inside an envelope which she opens and reads 
immediately.  We see the note.  

NOTE
Gone fishing with a friend - maybe
buffalo hunting.  Johnnie.


                    MARIETTA
          Oh God!  What does that mean?

                    MANAGER
          I’m sure I wouldn’t know, ma’am ...
          and buffalo hunting too ... hmmmmm?

                    MARIETTA
          And jus when my baby’s out on some
          Texas road with a killer.

The front door of the hotel opens and in walks Santos.  He seems to know 
exactly where Marietta is and steps to the door of the sitting room off 
the lobby.  He stands in the doorway and smiles at Marietta.

                    MARIETTA
               (horrified whisper)
          Santos...  Where’s J-J-Johnnie?

                    SANTOS
          Shhhhhh...
               (to the manager and desk clerk)
          Thank you, gentlemen...  I’ll look
          after her now...

The Manager and Desk Clerk bow to Marietta and Santos and go back 
through the lobby.  Santos walks over to Marietta.  Marietta stands.

                    MARIETTA
          Santos...  What’s happenin’ here?

                    SANTOS
          Hey...  Stop the nervous cry-baby
          routine...  You’re my girl now...
          Santos is gonna wipe away those tears
          and make you happy...  Come on, let’s
          get outta here.

                    MARIETTA
          Where we goin’?

                    SANTOS
          Got word the kids are moving through
          Texas...  I think an ending is being
          arranged there...  Come on, lemme
          see a smile.

                    MARIETTA
          Please Santos...  Where’s Johnnie?

118. EXT. SMALL HUT - DESERTED BAYOU - NIGHT

Light comes from one small dirty window.

                                        CUT TO:

119. INT. SMALL HUT - DESERTED BAYOU - NIGHT

Johnnie is tied to a small wooden straight-backed chair.  His mouth is 
gagged and taped shut.  His hair is caked with dry blood and one fresh 
tickle curls down his forehead to his eyes which are just now beginning 
to open and focus.  Juana is finishing tying his left ankle to the chair 
leg.  Johnnie moans and Juana brings her big, smiling face up in front 
of his.

                    JUANA
          Johnnie, you take a good look at me,
          baby, cause you gonna haf’ta watch
          close to know when we do it to ya...
          Y’all count when I touch the bottle -
          HO!!...
               (she slaps Johnnie hard
               across the face)
          There I slap that mutha fucka face -
          pay attention fucka - otherwise we 
          haf’ta work it all night...  Too 
          much fun for us - you see what I 
          mean?  Now watch me how I touch a
          bottle and you count how many times.

Juana steps two paces across the hut where two dirty old soda bottles 
sit - one in one corner perched on a dried tree trunk - the other in the 
opposite corner perched on an old fence post.  Juana touches the left 
bottle (#1) once, and crosses and touches the right bottle (#2) once and 
comes back and touches Johnnie’s face.

                    JUANA
          You see, Johnnie.  I toucha number
          one bottle once, I toucha number two
          bottle once, and I touch your face.
          This is a game we love to play.  I
          get hot already...  Now you meet 
          second Mr. Killer...  Does he fish
          or don’t he?

Reggie and Drop Shadow step out of the darkness behind Johnnie and come 
around to face him.

                    REGGIE
          Hey, Johnnie...  Reggie - you remember
          Reggie, don’t ya?  Look what I caught.
               (to Juana)
          I’m gettin’ hot too, mama.

Reggie and Juana kiss hot in front of Johnnie.  Juana puts her face down 
in front of Johnnie’s again.

                    JUANA
          Now Johnnie...  We want to feel the
          feelin’...  Feel the feelin’...  We

          head will go every part’a this room...
          I talk ’bout NO MO JOHNNIE...  I 
          think you understand now - we play game.

                    REGGIE
               (from behind Johnnie)
          I can’t stop her, Johnnie...  She
          get’s me too hot doin’ this...  I’m
          gonna be right here, but I’m gonna
          stand right behind ya with this big
          ol’ gun here...

Reggie reaches his hand around in front of Johnnie - showing him a .45 
Automatic.

                    DROP SHADOW
          That’s a Marine issue.  It goes off
          somethin’ terrible - you wanna see?

Drop Shadow pulls the hammer back which makes a loud “click.”

                    JUANA
          You hear click?

Johnnie jumps as Drop Shadow blows a big hole in the far wall in front 
of Johnnie.

                    REGGIE
               (laughs)
          Hell, it’s even worse than I 
          remember...  Wait a minute...

Reggie comes out in front of Johnnie - Juana grabs him.  They kiss hot 
again.

                    JUANA
          Okay, gimmee ’nother kiss, Reggie
          b’fore I fuck ya right now...
          FUCKIN’ HOT NOW, REGGIE.
              (she opens her mouth with 
               her tongue sticking out)
          FUCKIN’ HOT!

Juana screams like a monster from hell coming up close to Johnnie’s 
face.

                    JUANA
          You think you gonna live through
          this night?...  YOU WRONG...  I
          SMELL YO SHIT NOW, JOHNNIE.  GIVE
          US ONE MO KISS, REGGIE.  OH FUCK 
          ME!!!  WE TOUCH BOTTLES NOW - FO
          WE CAN’T WAIT NO MO.

Reggie goes back behind Johnnie quick.

                    JUANA
          I go out now...  I toucha one bottle...
          Reggie...  I toucha two bottle...
          I come back, I touch Johnnie...  AHHHHH
          ...  I touch myself...
               (she puts her hand 
            between her legs)
          HA!...  Now I go out - I toucha one
          bottle...  Do I touch second bottle?...
          I go now and touch...  OH OH...  Okay...

          WITH TONGUE - TOUCH MYSE’F IN HOT

          ROUND AND ROUND YOU AHHHH - GO OUT AND
          TOUCH A NUMBER ONE BOTTLE - WAIT NOW!!!
          ...  REGGIE...  YOU SHOW NOW-

Reggie reaches his hand around Johnnie’s face - tears off tape and gag - 
then opens his hand and shows Johnnie a cufflink with a particular 
design in turquoise, orange, and silver.

                    REGGIE
          I forgot to show you this.  The
          gentlemen that gave this to me said
          you’d recognize it.  Said he wanted 
          it’d be ’bout the last thing you ever
          saw in this life.

                    JOHNNIE
               (recognizing cufflink)
  Oh God...  OH GOD...  Santos...  
          Oh God Marietta ... are you in on
          this?...  OH GOD!!!

                    JUANA
          I GO ROUND AND ROUND - DO I TOUCH A
          SECOND BOTTLE B’FORE I TOUCH JOHNNIE
          - DO I?  DO I???.........
              (very quietly and breathy)
          No...  I touch Johnnie.

As her finger touches Johnnie’s face there is a loud “CLICK.”  Johnnie 
moans and closes his eyes.

                    JUANA
               (counting fast)
          One ... two ... three ... four ...
          five ... GETTIN’ TOO FUCKIN’ HOT, 
          REGGIE...  FEELIN’ MYSE’F ... six
          ... seven ... eight...

Johnnie starts to scream and violently try to move out of his chair.

                    JUANA
          Nine...
             (she moves out of the way)
          FUCK ME NOW, REGGIE...  TEN!!!

We see a hole in the front of the barrel - BOOM!!!

The opposite wall and bottles get covered with blood.  Juana and Reggie 
race into each other’s arms and kiss right above Johnnie’s dead, 
bloodied head.

                    JUANA
          FUCK ME!!!!

Lula and Sailor are driving through the dark desert.

                    LULA
          Sure is a big deal round here...
          Alamo Road, Alamo Street, Alamo Square,
          Alamo Buildin’, Alamo Alamo.  They ain’t
          forgettin’ about it in a hurry.  That’s
          the thing ’bout memory?  Some things
          you wish you could forget...  What’s
          troublin’ you, sugar?

                    SAILOR
          You know, Lula, I never told you 
          what all I was doin’ before I met you.

                    LULA
          I just figured you was out bein’
           Mr. Cool...

                    SAILOR
          Not exactly, sugar...  One reason
          we’re in all the trouble we’re in
          right now is cause of what I was
          doin’...  I tried to tell you this
          before...  

                    LULA
          You’re scarin’ me, baby.

                    SAILOR
          Well, there’s a good side as well as
          a bad side to it...  The good side
          is I knew your daddy, and I thought
          Clyde was a good ol’ guy...

                    LULA
          You knew my daddy?

                    SAILOR
          Yes I did...  I sure did...  The bad
          side of it is I did some drivin’
          for a man named Marcello Santos...

                    LULA
          Oh shit...

                    SAILOR
          I quit workin’ for ’im, but just
          before I did, I ended up one night at 
          a house...  I don’t know what it is
          they all think I saw that night, but
          I was just sittin’ out in the car
          till the whole place went up in flames.

                    LULA
          God, Sailor...  That’s the night my
          daddy died.

                    SAILOR
          I know, sugar...  But while the place
          was burnin’...  Before Santos came
          out - I pitched some rocks at the 
          second floor windows case anyone was
          upstairs sleepin’...  Afterwards...
          When I met you, I always liked to 
          think I mighta saved your life.

                    LULA
          That’s some big secret you been 
          carryin’, Sailor.

                    SAILOR
          We all got a secret side, baby.  Hope
          you don’t think I been lyin’ to you
          ’bout other things, sugar.

                    LULA
          How’d you know my daddy?

                    SAIL0R
          Met him through Santos...  Clyde -
          your daddy - had some sorta business
          deal with Santos.

Lula stays quiet for a moment - listening to the heavy hum of the V-8.

                    SAILOR
          Lula, you there?

                    LULA
          Yeah, I’m here.

                    SAILOR
          You upset with me?

                    LULA
          No, Sailor darlin’.  Just shockin’
          sometimes when things aren’t the 
          way you thought they were...  I been
          carryin’ a secret too...

The livingroom is on fire.

The livingroom is on fire and we move upstairs - Lula races through the 
smoke-filled hallway to her mother’s bedroom.

The livingroom is on fire and Lula throws open the door to her mother’s 
bedroom just in time to see Marcello Santos leaving through a window.  
Her mother laughs a wild, crazy laugh - exactly the same laugh Lula 
heard on the porch of the Cape Fear Hotel.

                    LULA
               (voice-over)
          That night in the fire while my

            (after a pause - she smiles)
          So Sailor, our histories have been
          somewhat intertwined.

                    SAILOR
          They have, sugar.

                    LULA
          I take that as a sign that we were
          destined by fate to be together.

                    SAILOR
          It’s a comfortin’ idea.

                    LULA
          Well, we’re really out in the middle
          of it now, ain’t we?

                    SAILOR
          There’s worse places, honey.

                    LULA
          If you say so.

                    SAILOR
          Trust me on it.

                    LULA
               (turns to him)
          I do trust you, Sailor.  Like I 
          ain’t never trusted nobody before.

                    SAILOR
               (after a moment)
          We’ll be al’right, peanut, long as 
          we’ve got room to move.

                    LULA
             (looking into the highway)
          What’s that?

                    SAILOR
          I don’t know...  Looks like clothes.

Sailor starts to slow down.  The highway is suddenly littered with 
clothes strewn everywhere and two open suitcases smashed near the side 
of the road.  Sailor slows down to a crawl.  He and Lula turn to each 
other - they’ve just seen TWO DEAD BODIES.  One close to the side of the 
highway - and other just off in the desert brush.  Off behind is an 
overturned car.

                    LULA
          Oh God, Sailor.


                    SAILOR
          One bad car accident...

                    LULA
          SAILOR!!!

Coming out of the darkness is a YOUNG GIRL, her clothes half torn off - 
blood draining out of several deep wounds.

                    LULA
          Sailor, what are we gonna do?

                    SAILOR
          I don’t know, honey, but we gotta 
          help that girl - get her to a town and
          hope no one catches on I broke parole.

They get out of the car and the girl comes toward them screaming.

                    GIRL
               (completely gone in shock)
          I’ve got about five hundred dollars 
          in my wallet and I can’t find it...
          My mother’s going to kill me.  It’s 
          got all my cards in it...  It was 
          in my pocket...  Now my pockets gone.
          MY PURSE IS GONE!!!  NOW SHE TELLS ME.

The girl starts walking back toward the car.

                    SAILOR
          Let’s get ahold a’ her quick.

                    LULA
          You think she’s gonna make it?

                    SAILOR
          Don’t know, but she’s gonna bleed
          all over our car, I’ll tell ya that...
                     (to Girl)
          Hey...  Hello...  Girl...  You gotta
          come with us, honey.

Sailor reaches out cautiously and takes hold of the girl’s arm.

                    GIRL
          OWWW GOD!!!  LEAVE ME ALONE...
          ROBERT!!!...  Shit, I got this damn
          sticky stuff in my hair...

She keeps digging her fingers into a bloody wound in her head.

                    GIRL
          Gotta find my wallet.
               (to Sailor)
          Don’t you say one word of this to
          my mother.  God, she’s gonna kill me.

The girls falls to one knee and struggles to get back up.  Sailor and 
Lula each take an arm and try to help her.

                    GIRL
          WHERE’S MY HAIRBRUSH?...

Sailor and Lula help the girl stand, but her eyes start rolling back and 
a bunch of fresh blood comes gushing up out of her mouth.

                    LULA
          I can’t take this, Sailor.  She’s
          dyin’ right in front of our eyes...

                    SAILOR
          I’m afraid she is, baby.

Sailor kneels down next to the girl and runs his hand gently across her 
forehead.

                    GIRL
               (wide-eyed now)
          Get my lipstick...
               (whisper)
          It’s in my purse.

The girl dies.  Sailor and Lula hold real still for a moment.  Lula 
starts to cry.

                    LULA
          She died right in front of me.  Why’d
          she have to go and do that, Sailor?

                    SAILOR
          Let’s get outta here, honey.

Before getting up, Sailor lets his hand come off the girl’s forehead 
down over her eyes - closing them.  He puts his hand on her cheek then 
gets up.  He puts his arm around Lula and they go back to her car.  
Sailor helps Lula in on her side and closes the door for her.  He goes 
around, gets in and looks over at Lula, who breaks down crying harder.  
Sailor starts the car and takes off.

123. INT. THUNDERBIRD - BIG TUNA - MORNING

The Thunderbird drives past a large stucco fish on a rock stand which 
has a sign on it that says “BIG TUNA, TEXAS.”  Sailor cruises the T-Bird 
along the main street of Big Tuna, eye-balling the place.

                    SAILOR
          Well, it ain’t exactly Emerald City...

                    LULA
          Not quite as bad as the weather though...
          It must be a hundred and ten and it 
          ain’t even noon yet.


123A. EXT. IGUANA MOTEL - MORNING

Sailor pulls the car up in front of the Iguana Motel.

                    SAILOR
          This’ll do.

124. INT. IGUANA MOTEL - DAY

The room is simple: double bed, dresser, mirror, chair, sink, toilet, 
bathtub (no shower), electric fan, window overlooking the street.

                    SAILOR
          Not bad for eleven dollars a day.

                    LULA
          No radio or TV...

She strips off the spread, tosses it in a corner and sits down on the 
bed.

                    LULA
          And no AC.

                    SAILOR
          Fan works.

                    LULA
          Now what?

                    SAILOR
          Let’s get a sandwich and find out
          about some work.

                    LULA
          Sailor?

                    SAILOR
          Yeah?

                    LULA
          This ain’t exactly my most thrillin’
          notion of startin’ a new life.

They stare at each other.  Lula suddenly feels sick to her stomach and 
slumps down on the edge of the bed.

                    LULA
          I’m gonna stay here in this room, 
          Sailor.  I don’t feel so good?  This
          heat makes me tired.

                    SAILOR
          Okay, honey, I’ll see you later.

125. EXT. RED’S GARAGE - DAY

A tall, skinny man, RED, in his early thirties with wild, uncombed hair 
the color of pomegranate, walks out of the garage.

                    SAILOR
          You Red?

                    RED
               (with a smile)
          Well, I ain’t Blackie.

Sailor holds out his right hand to shake.

                    SAILOR
          Name’s Sailor Ripley.  Katy over at
          the drugstore thought you might have
          some work I could do.

Red extends his oil-blackened right hand and shakes.

                    RED
          Things ain’t real hot right now.
          Rex, there though,
               (nodding toward a half-naked
               man burrowed under an ’83 Buick)
          is about to relocate in about a week
          to San Angelo.  I might could use a
          man when he does...  You good with
          engines?

                    SAILOR
          I ain’t no Enzo Ferrari, but they 
          used to call me Wrench when I was a
          kid.

                    RED
          We’ll see how she goes then when
          Rex takes off.  Check back.

Two men, SPARKY and BUDDY, both about forty, walk up to Red.  One of 
them wears a grey baseball cap with a Confederate flag on it and the 
other has an LBJ straw Stetson.

                    SPARKY
          How’s it look?

                    RED
          Reckon the head’s cracked, like I
          thought.

                    SPARKY
          Shit, that’s what I was afraid of.

                    RED
          I’ll get you foreigners a beer.



                    BUDDY
               (to Sailor)
          I’m Buddy, and this here’s Sparky.

Sailor introduces himself to Sparky and Buddy and Rex.  They all shake 
hands or nod and move out of the sun to drink their beers.

                    SAILOR
          My girl and I are lookin’ for a 
          place to settle.  We’re bunked down
          at the Iguana Motel.

                    SPARKY
          So are we.  It’s the only motel in 
          Big Tuna.  Have you met Bobby ‘Just
          Like The Country’ Peru yet?

                    SAILOR
          No, we just got in a hour and a 
          half ago.

                    BUDDY
          You will.  He’s the Mr. Fix-It at 
          the Iguana.  His truck broke down 
          here a couple of months ago.

                    REX
          Escaped con.  Man got some serious
          prison tattoos.

                    RED
          Ever’body got a past.

                    BUDDY
          Just some got more future in ’em
          than others.

                    REX
          That ain’t no lie.

Sailor finishes his beer, stands it on the ground and steps on it, 
crushing it flat.

                    SAILOR
          Been nice meetin’ y’all.  ’Preciate
          the beer.  I’ll be seein’ y’all
          soon.

                    BUDDY
          Very soon.

                    SPARKY
          One thing about bein’ in Big Tuna:
          you don’t have much choice about who 
          you see and who you don’t.

127. INT. IGUANA MOTEL - DAY

In front of the door there is a large, damp spot on the rug where about 
a hundred and fifty flies are buzzing and landing.  Sailor sees this 
when he opens the door.  He steps across the large spot and finds Lula 
just waking up on the bed.

                    LULA
          That you, Sail, honey?

                    SAILOR
          The only one.

Lula opens her eyes and looks at him.

                    LULA
          You find any work?

                    SAILOR
          Maybe.  Met a guy named Red, owns a
          garage, could have some work in
          about a week.  Met a few hard luck
          boys who’s stayin’ here.  What’s
          that smell?

                    LULA
          I barfed.  Tried to make it to the
          bathroom...  Turned out it was the
          wrong door anyways...  I sorta got
          it cleaned up.

                    SAILOR
          You sick?

                    LULA
          A little, I think...  Darlin’?

                    SAILOR
          Yeah?

                    LULA
          Come sit by me.

Sailor goes over and sits on the bed.

                    LULA
          I don’t know that this is the right
          place for us.

Sailor strokes Lula’s head.

                    SAILOR
          It ain’t gonna be forever, peanut.

Lula closes her eyes.

                    LULA

129. INT. IGUANA MOTEL - COURTYARD - NIGHT

Sailor, Lula, Sparky, and Buddy are sitting in the courtyard of the 
motel sharing Sparky’s fifth of Ezra Brooks.  An electric bug killer is 
working overtime.  Buddy is reading from a newspaper.

                    BUDDY
               (reading from paper)
          “Robert Brenton, twenty-five, was 
          killed when his car went off the road
          on State Highway 118, according to the
          Department of Public Safety.  Brenton
          and two passengers, William Reese and
          Susan Day, were thrown from the 
          automobile, reports said.”

Sailor looks at Lula.

                    SAILOR
          Susan Day...

The assistant manager, TOMMY THOMPSON, speaks from the shadows behind 
the group.

          Robert Brenton, that dumb fuck.  That
          stupid shit...  That fuckin’ Bob was

          there in number four where al them

          Tell ’em it floats.

                    BUDDY
          Sparky’s big on Florida jokes.

                    SPARKY
          You need a active sense of humor to
          survive in the Big Tuna.

BOBBY PERU walks in and comes over.

                    BOBBY
          Hey, everybody.

                    BUDDY
          Sailor, Lula, this here’s the man 
          himself.  Bobby, this is Sailor
          and Lula, the most recent strandees,
          economic variety.

Bobby nods to Lula and offers a hand to Sailor.

                    BOBBY
          Bobby Peru, just like the country.

Sparky and Buddy laugh.

                    BUDDY
          Accordin’ to Red and Rex, Bobby’s
          the most excitin’ item to hit Big
          Tuna since the ’86 cyclone sheared
          the roof off the high school.

          ain’t a young thing around don’t 
          know how that cobra tattoo works,

Bobby laughs.  He has a lopsided grin that exposes only three brownish 
front teeth and he has flat black eyes that seem to reflect no light.

                    LULA
          You from Texas, Mr. Peru?

Bobby pulls up a chair and pours himself a shotglass full of whiskey.

                    BOBBY

Bobby looks down at his hand, flexs it.

                    BUDDY
          Lotta women and kids and old people
          died at Cao Ben.

                    BOBBY
          March, 1968.  We torched a village
          and the government made a big deal
          out of it.

Bobby sips the whiskey and closes his eyes for several seconds before 
reopening them and looking at Buddy.  His eyes open slowly and they 
practically burn a hole in Buddy.

                    BOBBY
               (to Buddy)
          You was on a ship, pardner.  Hard to
          make contact with the people when
          you’re off floatin’ in the Gulf of
          Tonkin.

                    SPARKY
              (changing the subject)
          Hey Bobby, have yourself another 
          glass ’a Jack.

Sparky refills Bobby’s shotglass.  Bobby tosses it back in one gulp.

                    BOBBY
          Don’t mind if I fuckin’ do...  
          Speakin’ ’a Jack...  One-eyed Jacks
          yearnin’ to go a peepin’ in a
          seafood store...  Good meetin’ you.
          Adios, boys.

He walks out and after he’s gone...

                    LULA
          Somethin’ in that man scares me.

                    BUDDY

          well.  I’m goin’ to bed.

Lula goes right to the bed and flops down on it.

          Anything I can do for you?

                    LULA
          No, I don’t think so, Sail.  I
          just need to lie down.

Lula listens to Sailor brush his teeth, urinate into the toilet and 
flush it.  Sailor comes out of the bathroom and climbs into bed.

                    LULA
          Sailor?  You know what?

                    SAILOR

                    LULA
          Not that.  Look at what I wrote down
          cause I can’t say it.

Lula hands Sailor a note which reads “I’m pregnant.”  Sailor looks into 
her eyes.

          Well, nothin’ personal, but I ain’t
          sure it’s okay by me.

Sailor crumples the note and puts it in the ashtray.

          Really, Sailor, it ain’t nothin’ 
          against you.  I love you.

          the car.

                    BOBBY
          Man, I gotta take a piss bad...  Can
          I use your head there?

                    LULA
          Well...  Yeah - okay.

                    BOBBY
          I don’t mean your head head - I’m
          not gonna piss on your head - your
          hair an’ all...  Just piss in the
          toilet.  Y’all take a listen - 
          here a deep sound comin’ down from
          Bobby Peru.

Bobby enters the bathroom and starts to urinate.

132. EXT. PERDITA DURANGO’S HOUSE - DAY

Sailor pulls the T-Bird up front and hurries up to the screen door.  
Flies are buzzing all around.  PERDITA DURANGO comes forward out of the 
darkness inside.

                    PERDITA
               (recognizing him)
          Oh...  Look at this...  What do you
          want, snakeskin?

                    SAILOR
          Just passin’ through on my way to
          who knows where...

                    PERDITA
          Sure...  I figured I’d see you 
          sometime...

                    SAILOR
          Hopin’ you could tell me if there’s
          a contract out on me.  I really
          need to know.

                    PERDITA
          By who?

                    SAILOR
          I think Santos or Marietta Fortune.

                    PERDITA
          Heard you was goin’ out with that
          bitch’s daughter.

                    SAILOR
          You heard right.

                    PERDITA
          You really are one dumb asshole.

                    SAILOR
          Life is unpredictable.

                    PERDITA
          Does that girlfriend of yours know
          that her mama and Santos killed her
          daddy?
               (Sailor doesn’t answer -
               Perdita smiles)
          Does she know her own daddy was one 
          of the biggest drug dealers around -
          till he started snortin’ the shit 
          himself?...
               (Sailor doesn’t answer)
          Does she know you was around that 
          night her daddy was set fire to?

                    SAILOR
          I didn’t see nothin’...

                    PERDITA
          Yeah...  But I did...  And I told you
          all about it...

                    SAILOR
          Is there a contract?...  We made a
          deal once that we’d tip each
          other off if we ever heard.

                    PERDITA
          I know...  I remember.

                    SAILOR
          Well?...

                    PERDITA
          I ain’t heard of nothin’.

          of puke...  You been pukin’ in here,
          little girl?  Huh?...  You sick?...
          Pregnant?

                    LULA
               (flinches)
          You used the toilet, now you can go
          - what I do around here ain’t any
          of your business, that’s for sure.

                    BOBBY
          You know, I really do like a woman
          with tits like yours that talks
          tough and acts like she can fuck
          like a bunny...  Can you fuck like
          that?...  You like it like a bunny?...
          Huh?...  Cause baby, I’ll fuck you
          like a real good like a big ol’ jack-
          rabbit bunny...  Jump all around in
          that hole...  Bobby Peru doesn’t come
          up for air.

                    LULA
          Get out.

                    BOBBY
          Am I scarin’ ya?...  Your pussy wet?
          ...  Come on ... is it?...
             (moves his hand toward her)
          Hey, don’t jump back so slow...  I
          thought you was a bunny...  Bunny 
          jump fast - you jump back slow...
          Mean somethin’, don’t it?...  Means
          somethin’ to me...  Means you want
          Bobby Peru...  You want Bobby Peru
          to fuck you hard baby - open you
          up like a Christmas present.

Suddenly Bobby jumps back, shakes his head and straightens his hair.

                    BOBBY
          Hey...  I’m sorry...  I don’t think
          I’m bein’ too polite here ... and
          I apologize...  Hell...  A man sees
          a pretty woman and first thing he
          knows, he loses his manners...  Sure
          sign of modern times...  Next thing
          ya know, his old hand’ll start 
          crawlin’ around where it oughtn’t to
          go...  I’ll be real honest with ya...
          I’d like to fuck you and tear you
          open like a paycheck envelope...
          Will you be honest with me - would
          you like me to do it?...  Just a 
          simple yes or no...

He steps a little closer to her.

                    BOBBY
          Just feel me breathin’ on you...
          And you’ll know I mean business when
          it comes to fuckin’.

With all the strength she can muster, Lula slaps Bobby across the face.

                    LULA
          GET OUT!!!

Bobby grabs on to her hard.

                    BOBBY
          Bobby Peru grab you now...  Hold
          you tight...  Feel everythin’ in you
          now...  Stay quiet...  Say “fuck me”
          and then I’ll leave.

                    LULA
               (struggling)
          No way...  GET OUT!!!

                    BOBBY
          Say it!...  I’LL TEAR YOUR FUCKIN’ 
          HEART OUT, GIRL...  Say “fuck me”
          soft - then I’ll leave.  Say “fuck
          me”...  Whisper it...  Then I’ll
          leave...  Say it...  Say it -  Say
          it -  Say it...

Bobby moves in very close to her - Lula’s trembling.  Bobby puts his 
hand on her neck and moves it up and down behind her ear.

                    BOBBY
          Say it...  Then I’ll leave...  Whisper
          it...  Whisper it...  Whisper it...
          Whisper “fuck me”...

His hand moves down over her breasts - down across her stomach - and 
down.  Lula’s left hand opens and spreads wide.

                    BOBBY
          Whisper it...  Whisper “fuck me”...
          Whisper...  Whisper...  Whisper...
          Whisper...

                    LULA

          have to be goin’ now...  Conta i

Bobby leaves smiling and slams the door.  Lula stands trembling clicking 
her heels together.

          Need a hand?

                    SAILOR
          Thanks, Bobby, ’bout done.

Sailor throws some stuff in the trunk and closes the lid.

                    BOBBY
          How ’bout a beer?

                    SAILOR
          That’d be fine, Bobby.

                    BOBBY
          Let’s go by Rosarita’s.  You been

They get into the Cadillac and Bobby takes off down Big Tuna’s main

          Hell, no, belongs to my girl’s sister.
          The sister’s been over to New Orleans,

They claim two stools.

          Couple Stars, Jimmy.

The BARTENDER brings over two bottle and two mugs - then walks back to 
the other end of the bar.

                    SAILOR

Bobby returns from the jukebox and sits down next to Sailor.

          Q-7, three times.  Pee Wee King’s
          “Waltz of Regret,” my favorite tune.

Pee Wee’s steel guitar ripples through the cigarette haze and buzzes 
around Sailor’s head.  His reflection wobbles in the long mirror behind 
the bar.

                    BOBBY
          I been studyin’ a situation over in
          Lobo, take two men to handle it.

Sailor stares at Bobby and works hard to focus his eyes.

          No...  I don’t think so, man.

                    BOBBY

          I take one in the back to open the
          safe, you keep the other’n covered...

                    SAILOR
             (a tinge of jealousy/fear)
          Lula tell you she’s pregnant?

Bobby grins, showing those three brown teeth.

                    BOBBY
          Couple grand or more’d give you two
          a leg up.  Get you to the west
          coast, Mexico, most anyplace, with
          a few dollars in your jeans.  I 
          got it figured good, Sailor.

                    BOBBY
          Talked to her this afternoon...
          While you was out.

                    SAILOR
          She really say she was pregnant?

                    BOBBY
               (smiles - puts a hand on
               Sailor’s shoulder)
          Just took a guess is all...  You
          in or out on this deal?

               on his shoulder)
          I ain’t fuckin’ sure, Bobby.

                    BOBBY
          Don’t think about it too long.
            (nods toward Sailor’s mug)
          You had enough?

                    SAILOR

          to show ya.


136A. EXT. ROARITA’S - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Bobby looks around in the purple twilight before he opens the trunk of 
the Eldorado.  He peels back a brown army blanket.

                    BOBBY
          That’s a double-barreled, sawed-off,
          Ithaca shotgun with a carved pistol
          grip stock wrapped with adhesive tape.
          Next to it’s a cold Smith and Wesson
          .32 handgun with a six inch barrel.
          These’ll do ’er...  Loosen up that
          five grand...  Two and a half for you
          and the little lady...

Bobby closes the trunk.  Sailor stands - hesitating to commit.

                    BOBBY
          How much money you have between the
          two a’ya right now?...

                    SAILOR
          Forty bucks...

                    BOBBY
          This is easy money, pardner...  No
          ones gonna get hurt in this thing...
          And I don’t think you can afford not
          to take it...  I’ll be bringin’ the
          Eldo ’round the front of the motel
          at ten tomorrow mornin’...  If you
          ain’t a pussy - you’ll be there.

Sailor stares at him and his fist clenches.

                    SAILOR
          I don’t particularly care for that
          kind of talk, Bobby.

                    BOBBY
          Hey...  I never said you was a pussy...
          Always figured you had the big ol’
          round balls for this kind’a thing...
          Sure would set you and that pretty
          little girl up good.

                    SAILOR
          Yeah ... yeah...  I guess so...
          That kind’a money’d get us a long 
          way down that yellow brick road...

Bobby cocks his head and squints at him questioningly.

                    SAILOR
          ...But DAMN man...  This better go
          smooth.

                    BOBBY

                    LULA
          Some...  Sparky said Red’s promised 
          to have him and Buddy out of here
          by the weekend.

                    SAILOR
          Oughta make ’em happy.

                    LULA
          So where’d you say you was?

                    SAILOR
                (can’t look at her)
          Went with Bobby.

Sailor sits on the bed and starts undressing.

                    LULA
          Sail?

                    SAILOR
          Uh huh?

                    LULA
          Let’s leave here.

                    SAILOR
          We’re goin’ to, Lula, real soon.

                    LULA
          I mean tomorrow.

                    SAILOR
          We got about forty bucks, sweetheart.
          That’d get us to El Paso.

                    LULA
          Rather be in El Paso than Big Tuna.

Sailor gets into bed.

                    SAILOR
          You shouldn’t be smokin’ if you’re
          pregnant.  Ain’t smart.

Lula sticks a More between her lips and lights it.  She takes a deep 
drag, blows out the smoke, and stares at Sailor.

                    LULA
          Who says I’m smart?  You up to 
          somethin’ with Bobby Peru, Sailor?

                    SAILOR
          What could I be up to, Lula?

                    LULA
          He’s a stone fuckin’ criminal, honey,
          and you ain’t.

                    SAILOR
          I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn’t I?

                    LULA
          That was a accident.  I bet both our
          asses Bobby Peru done murdered all
          kinds of people, and meant it, too.

                    SAILOR
          That was in Vietnam.

                    LULA
          He’s the kind liked it.

                    SAILOR
          Lula, I got to get some sleep.

                    LULA
          Buddy told me about that thing at
          Cao Ben?

                    SAILOR
          What?

                    LULA
          Was a massacre.  Soldiers there 
          murdered old folks, women and babies,
          and dumped ’em in a trench.  Bobby
          Peru prob’ly killed the most.

                    SAILOR
          Lula, he mighta did, I don’t know.
          But it don’t matter now.  Lotta guys
          go outta control in a war and it 
          ain’t their fault.

Lula puffs hard on her cigarette.

                    LULA
          I sure enjoy smokin’, Sailor.  I 
          hate that it’s bad for you.

Sailor turns on his side, away from Lula, and pulls a pillow over his 
head.

                    LULA
          That man’s a black angel, Sailor.
          You hook up with him, you’ll regret
          it.  If you live to.

S                    AILOR
          Thanks, darlin’, I know you got my
          best interest in mind, and I
          ’preciate it sincerely.  I love 
          you, but I gotta sleep now.

Lula lights a second More off the first one and stubs out the butt on 
the dresser top.  

                    LULA
          This whole worlds wild at heart and
          weird on top.

Lula turns over, away from Sailor.

          I wish you really, truly loved me...
          I wish you’d sing me “Love Me Tender”
          ...  I wish I was somewhere over 
          that rainbow...  Shit.  Shit, shit,

138. INT. BAY ST. CLEMENT HOTEL - STAIRCASE - NIGHT

Sailor and Lula are walking down the carpeted stairs when Sailor is 
called by BOB RAY LEMON, who is coming down towards them fast.  Marietta 
stands at the top - watching.

                    BOB RAY
          Hey Sailor...  Wait a minute...  I
          got somethin’ for ya.

As Bob Ray passes Lula on the stairs - he puts his hand between her 
legs.  Sailor starts to see red.  Bob Ray smiles and steps down to 
Sailor.  He leans in and whispers in Sailor’s ear.

                    BOB RAY
          Shit, man...  Marietta says you been 
          tryin’ to fuck her in the toilets 
          for the past ten minutes...  You
          crazy fuckin’ bad boy tryin’ to 
          fuck your girl’s mama...  How do
          you think that cute little cunt Lula
          would feel about that?  Hey, take a
          look at this...
               (shows Sailor one thousand
               dollars in cash)
          Marietta just gave me this to kill
          you right now, and afterward she
          said Lula was mine to fuck all the
          way into next Sunday.

Bob Ray pulls a knife, but Sailor’s fist is already halfway through Bob 
Ray’s brain.  From there, Sailor steps firmly into the crazy zone.  
Amidst blood-curdling hysterical screams from a growing throng of 
SOUTHERN BELLES, Sailor starts taking Bob Ray apart limb by limb and 
doesn’t stop until Bob Ray lays completely destroyed and completely dead 
at the foot of the stairs.  The crowd of formally dressed onlookers 
stand aghast.  Sailor stares up at Marietta.  Both their eyes burning 
with hate.

Bobby lets the screen door bang shut behind him as he comes in and roams 
around the livingroom.

          Nice of you to drop by.

Bobby keeps circling.

          Ain’t never had no girl pull a blade
          on me.

                    PERDITA
          Wish I’d fuckin’ cut you up good.

                    BOBBY
          You heard from Reggie?

                    PERDITA
          Juana called.  They’re stayin’ 
          another week.

Bobby stops walking and stares at the photograph on the wall.

                    BOBBY
          Stayin’ a few extra days in the big
          N.O., huh?  This you?

Perdita turns her head and looks, then turns back.

                    PERDITA
          Yes.

We see the photo now.  In it are Perdita along with her sister, Juana, 
and her husband, Reggie, whom we recognize as the killers of Johnnie.

                    BOBBY
          Don’t look like you.

Bobby turns around and leans down and puts his face next to Perdita’s 
from behind.


                    BOBBY
          The cobra’s waitin’ to strike, chica.

                    PERDITA
          That guy Sailor came around this
          afternoon...  Asked me if there was
          a contract out on ’im.

                    BOBBY
               (laughs out loud)
          No shit?!?!  You know him?

                    PERDITA
          Used to.

                    BOBBY
          What’d you say?

                    PERDITA
          No, of course.

Bobby takes out a silver dollar and flips it into the air.  It lands 
tails up in his hand.  He pockets it.

                    BOBBY
          That’s right...  Could have a bad
          accident, though ... before ... 
          durin’ ... or after a hold-up...

                    PERDITA
          What’s gonna happen when he sees me 
          drivin’ the car tomorrow?

                    BOBBY
          Maybe he’ll get a little nervous,
          but who gives a shit?

Bobby lowers his hands into the front of Perdita’s blouse and cups her 
breasts.  She burns the back of his left wrist with her cigarette.  
Bobby jumps back, then grabs Perdita’s hair and pulls her over the couch 
onto the floor.  Neither of them speak.  She tries to stand, but Bobby 
keeps his right foot on her chest while he blows the back of his wounded 
wrist.  Perdita shoves his leg to one side and rolls away.  She stand up 
and spits at him.

141. INT. IGUANA MOTEL - DAY

Lula lays very still on the bed.  Her head is close to the small 
turquoise radio on the bedside table.  She is listening to a piece of 
sad, nostalgic music and as we move in closer to her and the radio - the 
volume increases.

Lula remembers some “moments” in her life with Sailor: (Music continues 
over)

When he kissed her outside the jail gate.

When he touched her breast the day after he got out of jail.

When they sat behind the Confederate Soldier.

When they danced to “Slaughter House.”

Suddenly, Lula sees an image in her mind that she does not recognize.  
She sees an abstract image of reflected light with two eyes looking 
through it at her.  The image puzzles her.

(The Music continues over)

Sailor crawls in the back seat and sees Perdita just as she floors it

The second old man is reaching under the counter.

Sailor fires his .32 at Bobby.  There are no live bullets in his pistol.  
It just makes a dry click.  Bobby smiles and is just about to kill 
Sailor when out of the corner of his eye he catches sight of the second 
old man bringing out a big shotgun of his own.  Bobby instinctively 
spins and empties the second barrel of his two-barrel shotgun into the 
old gentleman.  As Bobby is reloading fast, Sailor sprints through the 
front door.  Bobby is right behind him as he flys out the front door.

The deputy recovers and comes up on one knee with his revolver clasped 
in both hands.  He fires his first shot into Bobby’s thigh and his 
second into Bobby’s left hip.  The shock of the initial slug causes 
Bobby to drop the bag.  The impact of the second forces Bobby’s right 
hand to twist sideways to that both barrels of the shotgun wedge under 
his chin.  The Ithaca goes off, blowing Bobby backwards through the 
RAMOS on the plate glass window of the feed store.

Sailor hits the ground - losing the Smith as he falls.  He puts his hand 
over his hosieried head and keeps his face in the dirt until the deputy

Dearest Sailor Darling,

The first thing you’ll want to know is I’m keeping the baby.
Mama wasn’t for it in the beginning but I think she’s looking
forward to it.  I’m gonna name it Pace no matter if it’s a 
boy or a girl.  Pace Ripley sounds good, don’t it?  It’s
kind of hard to believe that Pace will be six years old 
when you get out.

I feel like I’m kind of in prison too, but I know in six
months, it’ll be over and I’ll have a son or daughter to
show for it.  Our child!!

I love you Sailor.  I don’t know how much or what it 
means though I miss you an awful bunch sometimes I know
you’re thinking about me cause I can feel it.  I miss
you not being around to call me peanut nobody else ever
called me that.

Mama married Santos.  It just about drove me crazy.  My
daddy left a lot of money somehow and they’re spending
it like there is no tomorrow.  I’m going to move out as
soon as I can.

Mama and Santos said because of the baby they’re lookin’
at the two of us in a different light - whatever that
means.

Johnnie Farragut has plumb disappeared.  No one knows
where.  I miss him, but not near as much as I miss you.

Time don’t really fly honey does it?

Love,
your Lula

P.S. I miss dancing...

Dear Lula,

It is fine with me about the baby as you already know. 
And Pace being your family name and all is just right.
What about a middle name if it is a boy after my 
granddaddy Roscoe?  He would be proud I know though
he is long passed.  Pace Roscoe Ripley does not sound
so bad do you think?

This place is not so pretty as Pee Dee.  Not pretty
at all.  There are boys inside these walls meaner
than Peru you can bet.  There is a Death House.  I
am getting along.  The only thing is not thinking
about the future.

I miss dancing with you, too.  I love you.  It is
hard to end this letter.  If I stop writing you’re
gone.  There is not a lot more to say though.
Vava con dios mi amor.

ice water while talking on the telephone to her mother.  Marietta is 
wearing a giant diamond ring on one hand and the other hand is holding a 
Martini and Rossi sweet vermouth.  Marietta is slumped over in an 
ottoman with wheels and is pushing her drunken self around the 
livingroom as she talks on the phone.

                    LULA
          I’m goin’, mama.  No way I can’t go.

                    MARIETTA
          You ain’t takin’ Pace, though.

                    LULA
          Course I am, mama.

                    MARIETTA
               (sighs)
          What time’s Sailor’s train get in?

                    LULA
          Six.

                    MARIETTA
          Got any plans?

                    LULA
          Figure we’ll go have supper someplace.
          Maybe get some barbecue out by 
          Stateline.  Sailor always liked that
          Havana Brown’s Pig Pickin’.

                    MARIETTA
          Well, you be careful with that boy,
          Lula.

                    LULA
          Sailor ain’t a boy no more, mama.

                    MARIETTA
          Don’t mean him.  It’s Pace concerns me.

                    LULA
          Really, mama, I gotta go.

                    MARIETTA
          What if I asked you not to?

                    LULA
          Wouldn’t make any difference.

                    MARIETTA
          What if I told you not to?

                    LULA
               (forcefully)
          Mama ... if you get in the way of
          me and Sailor’s happiness, I’ll
          fuckin’ pull your arms out by the
          roots.

Lula hangs up and throws her glass of water at a picture of her mother - 
draining it.

                                        CUT TO:

154. INT. LULA’S CAR - EVENING

PACE ROSCOE FORTUNE is a shy, polite, innocent six-year old who wears a 
long-billed fishing cap and pants with suspenders.

                    PACE
          How’ll we know what he looks like?

Lula makes a wide left turn onto Jeff Davis Highway without signaling, 
causing the driver of a white Bonneville headed across the intersection 
to jam on his brakes in order to avoid a collision.  The Bonneville 
driver sits on his horn and shouts at Lula.

                    PACE
          Mama, you almost crashed us.

Lula steadies the steering wheel of her Camaro with her left elbow while 
she strikes a match and lights up a More.  She throws the match out the 
window and takes possession of the wheel with both hands, the cigarette 
is clamped in her teeth.

                    LULA
          Don’t give me no trouble now, Pace,
          please.  This ain’t the easiest day
          in a long time.  And what do you
          mean how are we gonna know what your
          daddy looks like?  You seen his photo.


                    PACE
          How’ll he know what we look like?
          He seen our photo?

Lula puffs furiously several times on her More before she takes it out 
of her mouth and drops it.

                    LULA
          Damn it, child!  Now look what you
          made me do.

                    PACE
          What I made you do, mama?

Lula feels around on the floor with one hand until she finds the 
cigarette.  Sirens can be heard up ahead.

                    LULA
          Nothin’, honey. 
            (stubbing it out in the ashtray)
          Mama’s just actin’ strange.

                    PACE
          You ain’t actin’, mama.

                    LULA
          Why, Pace Roscoe Ripley, ain’t you
          got one cute mouth tonight?

They pass an automobile accident where a man has been thrown into the 
curb - his head broken open and bleeding.  The ambulance is just 
arriving.  Lula looks away.

                                        CUT TO:

155. ACCIDENT - EVENING

A CRAZY MAN in a wheelchair is wheel up to the accident victim, who is 
bleeding profusely and in a state of shock.  The man in the wheelchair 
stares at him for a moment.

                    WHEELCHAIR MAN
          Hey man...  HEY...  Same fuckin’
          thing happened to me last year...

                                        CUT TO:

156. INT. LULA’S CAR - EVENING

Pace looks up at his mother.

                    PACE
          I still ain’t sure what my daddy 
          looks like.

                    LULA
          Like you, sweetheart.  You and your
          daddy got the same mouth, eyes, ears,
          and nose.  Only difference is your
          color hair is like mine.

                    PACE
          My daddy ain’t never killed nobody,
          has he, mama?

                    LULA
          Course he ain’t never killed nobody.
          Why’d you say that, Pace?

                    PACE
          Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama
          talkin’.

                    LULA
          And?

                    PACE
          Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.

                    LULA
          Wrong, baby.  Your daddy never 
          committed no murder.  Musta been you 
          didn’t hear grandmama proper.  He made 
          some mistakes, is all.  Your daddy ain’t 
          always been so lucky...  We’re almost
          at the depot, honey.  Sit back a minute.

                                        CUT TO:

157. EXT. TRAIN STATION - EVENING

Lula pulls the Camaro into in the station parking lot and kills the 
engine.

                    PACE
          Why we sittin’ here, mama?

                    LULA
          Thinkin’ a second, baby.

Lula gets out and goes around for Pace.  They hold hands as they walk 
toward the station.  The big clock on the side of the building shows ten 
minutes past six.

                    PACE
          I’m scared, mama.

                    LULA
          Why, honey?

                    PACE
          Case daddy don’t like me.  What if
          he don’t like that I don’t got 
          his color hair.

                    LULA
          Pace, your daddy’d love you even
          if you didn’t have no hair at all.

CUT TO:                                        

158. INT. TRAIN STATION - EVENING

Lula sees Sailor as soon as she opens the door.  He is sitting in an 
orange plastic chair against the opposite wall, smoking a cigarette.

                    LULA
          Still partial to Camels, huh?

Sailor smiles.

                    SAILOR
          First pack of tailor-mades I had in
          a while.

He stands up and looks down at Pace, who is still holding hands with 
Lula.  Sailor puts out his right hand.

                    SAILOR
          You must be my son.

                    LULA
          Shake hands with your daddy.

Pace releases Lula’s hand and puts his own in Sailor’s.  Sailor grips it 
gently but firmly, pumps once, then lets go.

                    SAILOR
          Pleasure to meet you, Pace.  I read
          a lot about you.

Sailor looks at Lula.  Her eyes are full of tears and she lets them 
loose.  Sailor tries to smile.

                    LULA
          You hungry?  Pace and I ain’t had
          dinner yet.

                    SAILOR
          Lead the way.

Sailor picks up his black metal suitcase and follows them to the car.

CUT TO:                                        

159. INT. LULA’S CAR - NIGHT

Lula drives.

                    SAILOR
          No rag top, huh?

Lula starts to reply, then stops.  She stares straight ahead, gripping 
the wheel hard.  Suddenly, she pulls over to the side of the road, turns 
off the engine and gets out of the car.

                    PACE
          What’s wrong, mama?

                    SAILOR
               (turning to Pace and 
               patting his head)
          Don’t worry, son.  Just stay here.

Sailor gets out and goes over to Lula, who is leaning back against the 
hood.

                    LULA
          I’m sorry, Sailor.  I just can’t 
          help it.  Give me a minute and I’ll
          quit.

                    SAILOR
          Boys frightened, Lula.  This ain’t
          no good.

                    LULA
          Really, Sail, I’ll be okay.

                    SAILOR
          It’s a mistake, honey.  You two go on.
          I’ll walk back to the depot.

                    LULA
          What’re you talkin’ about?  That’s 
          your son in there.

                    SAILOR
          He ain’t never known me, Lula, so 
          there ain’t much for him to forget.
          Not seein’ each other for six years
          makes it next best to simple for us, too.

                    LULA
          How can you say that, Sailor?

                    SAILOR
          What makes sense, is all.

Sailor goes around to the driver’s side, reaches in and pulls the keys 
out of the ignition.  He unlocks the trunk, removes his suitcase, and 
closes the lid.

                    LULA
          Don’t do this, Sailor, please.

Sailor slips the keys in her shirt pocket and leans his head into the 
car.

                    SAILOR
               (to Pace)
          Oiga, amigo.  If ever somethin’ 
          don’t feel right to you, remember what
          Pancho said to The Cisco Kid...  
          ‘Let’s went, before we are dancing at
          the end of a rope, without music.’

Sailor stands up and looks at Lula.  Her eye makeup runs in dark streaks 
down her face.

ECU of Lula’s eyes.  Her eye makeup runs like black sweat over eyes and 
down her cheeks as in Sailor’s dream.

                    SAILOR
          You been doin’ fine without me, peanut. 
          There ain’t no need to make life 
          tougher’n it has to be.

He picks up his suitcase, kisses Lula lightly on the lips and walks 
away.  She lets him go.

160. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Sailor walks down the street pretending hard not to care.

                                        CUT TO:

161. INT. LULA’S CAR - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Lula climbs in behind the wheel - sobbing.  Pace sits sadly, staring out 
the window.

                                        CUT TO:

162. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Sailor continues walking down the street.  A GANG OF INSANE KILLER 
TEENAGERS on PCP appear and come towards Sailor.  They circle around 
him, coming in closer for the kill.

                    SAILOR
          What do you faggots want?

That’s all it takes.  The gang is on him.  Sailor tries to defend 
himself, but one big punch to his nose sends him down and out.  Blood 
begins to pour from his swelling nose.


162A. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

CU OF SAILOR’S FACE - a bright light illuminates it.

In the sky above Sailor, a large glowing bubble holding the beautiful 
Good Witch of the North comes floating down above him.

                    GOOD WITCH
          Sailor Ripley...

Sailor’s eyes suddenly see the Good Witch through his closed eyelids.  
His mouth speaks through closed lips.

                    SAILOR
          The Good Witch...

                    GOOD WITCH
          Sailor...  Lula loves you.

                    SAILOR
          But I’m a robber and a manslaughterer
          and I haven’t had any parental 
          guidance.

                    GOOD WITCH
          She’s forgiven you of all these things
          ...  You love her...  Don’t be
          afraid, Sailor.

                    SAILOR
          But I’m wild at heart.

                    GOOD WITCH
          If you are truly wild at heart, you’ll
          fight for your dreams...  Don’t turn
          away from love, Sailor...  Don’t turn
          away from love...  Don’t turn away
          from love.

The Good Witch disappears.


162. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Sailor opens his eyes and drags himself and his giant swollen nose up on 
his feet.  The gang still stands around him.

                    GANG MEMBER
          You had enough, asshole?

                    SAILOR
          Yes, I have...  And I wanna apologize
          to you gentlemen for referring to 
          you as homosexuals.  I also want to
          thank you fellas, you’ve taught me
          a valuable lesson in life.  
               (lifts his head high)
          LULA!!!!

Sailor turns around and starts running back.  The gang watches him go.

                                        CUT TO:

163. INT. LULA’S CAR - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Lula sits in the car in the middle of a giant traffic jam.  She is still 
crying and horns are honking all around them.

                                        CUT TO:

164. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Sailor runs up the street, holding his nose and SCREAMING LULA’S NAME.

He rounds a corner and spots her in the middle of a sea of cars.

He starts running towards her - leaping from one car to another until he 
jumps on the hood of Lula’s car.

She sees him.

                    SAILOR
          LULA!!!!

                    LULA
          SAILOR!!!!

Lula wriggles out of the car and flys into his arms.  Behind them is a 
giant golden sunset.  As they embrace - the sound of the horns goes 
away.  Lula’s gaze goes to a reflection of golden light on a windshield.  
It is the same abstract scene she saw before in her room in Big Tuna, 
but now she knows what it is.  It is Pace’s happy, smiling eyes looking 
up at the two of them in love.

Sailor, with a giant blue nose, looks into Lula’s eyes and sings “Love 
Me Tender.” 

The people in their cars, and the people on the street look on with a 
feeling of love and happiness in their hearts.





THE END
