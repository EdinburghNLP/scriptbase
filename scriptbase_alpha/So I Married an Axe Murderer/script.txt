OPEN ON:

MONTAGE OF VARIOUS SHOTS OF SAN FRANCISCO - DUSK

Over this we hear a recording of Jack Kerouac's poem, San 
Francisco which is accompanied by a BE-BOP trio. Kerouac's 
poetry coincides with the various shots of San Francisco. We 
come to a sign for Jack Kerouac Street. We PAN OVER to "THE 
CITY LIGHTS BOOKSTORE" and continue along to the ALLEYWAY 
where there is a large high-contrast black and white sign 
depicting Jack Kerouac in his famous "I'm looking into the 
distance, having a brilliant thought" pose...

CHARLIE MACKENZIE, in his late twenties, wearing a flannel 
shirt and torn jeans, walks INTO THE FRAME, right in front 
of the picture of Jack Kerouac and inadvertently strikes the 
exact same pose. We PULL BACK to reveal that Charlie has a 
bag of garbage in his right hand, which he deposits in the 
alleyway. We FOLLOW Charlie into...

INT. CITY LIGHTS BOOKSTORE

We FOLLOW him through the store. By day he is the Assistant 
Manager, by night he is a poet.

A MAN in his fifties, wearing a beret and a goatee is reading, 
Charles Bukowski's, Playing The Piano Like a Percussive 
Instrument, Until Your Fingers Begin To Bleed A Bit.

Charlie takes his place behind the cash register and resumes 
writing in his handsome leather-bound poetry journal.

          CHARLIE
          (sotto)
     O' SCOTLAND
     YOUR SUCKLED TEET OF SHAME

CUSTOMER approaches.

          CUSTOMER
     Do you have the book On The Road by 
     Jack Kerouac?

Every day there is a steady stream of tourists who come in 
to get copies of On The Road. Charlie is use to this and 
without looking up he points to a huge, well marked display 
of thousands of copies of On The Road. Another TOURIST COUPLE 
approach.

          TOURIST
     Do you have a copy of On The Road by 
     Jack Kerouac?

Again not looking up, Charlie just points.

          TOURIST
     Thanks.

EXT. CITY LIGHTS BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

Charlie puts the "CLOSED" sign on the door and proceeds to 
walk home.

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREETS

The sights and the sounds of the city are accentuated by the 
BEBOP as he sees life, warts and all. As the streets become 
less populated, he can now hear the sounds of his own 
FOOTSTEPS and, a COUPLE BICKERING. The streets become even 
more deserted. The night is closing in on him. A cat darts 
out from an alleyway and startles him. He quickens his pace. 
RUMBLINGS make him cross the street to avoid the danger. 
Headlights of a slow moving car approach from the distance. 
Charlie, frightened, turns another corner onto:

HIS STREET

He approaches a 3-story Victorian home, in which he has an 
apartment on the second floor, he notices a light on in his 
window. A CRASHING sound from within.

                                   CUT TO:

HANDS

taking papers out of a desk drawer.

                                   CUT TO:

CHARLIE

carefully opening the front door and then gingerly closing 
it. He reaches for a baseball bat in a nearby umbrella stand. 
Sound of BREAKING GLASS from his apartment upstairs.

                                   CUT BACK TO:

SHATTERED PICTURE FRAME

with a photo of Charlie and an angelic blonde.

                                   CUT BACK TO:

CHARLIE

finishing off the last two steps nearing the front door of 
his apartment, bat raised above his head ready to swing.

                                   CUT TO:

THE HANDS

clasp a jewelry box on the top of the dresser and stuff them 
into a dufflebag; the jewelry is followed by CD's.

                                   CUT TO:

CHARLIE

pushing open his apartment door in a mock SWAT maneuver, 
then stealthily stalking toward the sound of the intruder in 
the bedroom. He stubs his toe on a spring loaded doorstop 
making a loud metal VITTSWINGGGG's sound. He freezes, 
terrified.

                                   CUT TO:

THE BEDROOM

where the HANDS, freeze.

                                   CUT BACK TO:

CHARLIE

Like a coiled jungle cat ready to pounce, waits two beats... 
then springs Samurai style into...

THE BEDROOM

He freezes.

REVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL

that the HANDS belong to the angelic blonde in the broken 
picture. It's Charlie's girlfriend, SHERRI.

          CHARLIE
     Sherri! What are you doing?

          SHERRI
     I'm leaving you.

          CHARLIE
     Oh, thank God... I thought you were 
     robbing our own home, because frankly, 
     that's insane. I mean, what could 
     you possibly gain by robbing your 
     own home? I don't mean to meddle, 
     but isn't it better to rob other 
     peoples' homes? Start accumulating 
     their wealth as opposed to just 
     reaccumulating your own wealth.

          SHERRI
     That's not funny, Charlie. I'm really 
     leaving.

She continues to pack. Charlie tries to unpack her things.

          CHARLIE
     What?! Just because we had a fight 
     last night?

          SHERRI
     We've had a fight every night for 
     two months. Ever since I brought up 
     the subject of marriage, you've found 
     fault with everything I do. Why 
     couldn't we have gotten married, 
     Charlie?

          CHARLIE
          (beat)
     I'm too young to get married.
          (begins putting her 
          things back)
     I'm only twenty-nine and a half. We 
     love living together.

          SHERRI
     It's been two years now. I need 
     something more.

          CHARLIE
     See, Sherri, this is frustrating for 
     me, okay. When we first started going 
     out I thought we agreed that we 
     weren't the sort of people who got 
     married.

          SHERRI
     That's like saying we're not the 
     sort of people who are going to grow 
     old. We're not going to fall into 
     that "growing old" trap. Face it, 
     you've got a problem with commitment, 
     Charlie. Take a look at your other 
     girlfriends. Every time you get close 
     to a commitment there's something 
     wrong with them.

          CHARLIE
     Hey, I broke up with them for good 
     reasons.

          SHERRI
     What about Sandy?

          CHARLIE
     Sandy was an alcoholic.

          SHERRI
     No-no-no. You thought she was an 
     alcoholic. She just drank more than 
     you drank. What about Jill?

          CHARLIE
     She hated my family.

          SHERRI
     You thought she hated your family. 
     Nobody hates your family. Everybody 
     loves your family. What about Julie?

          CHARLIE
     She smelled like soup.

          SHERRI
     What does that mean?

          CHARLIE
     She smelled exactly like Campbell's 
     Beef Vegetable soup. She was dirty, 
     physically dirty.

          SHERRI
     Well, Charlie, I wonder what you're 
     gonna say were my problems? Are you 
     gonna tell your friends that I was a 
     junkie, that I wasn't supportive 
     enough or that I smelled like relish? 
     Charlie, I loved you. It could have 
     worked out.
          (she goes to the door)
     Think about it.

She leaves.

ANGLE ON - THE BROKEN PICTURE

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - CHARLIE'S CAR - DUSK

Charlie and his best friend, TONY SPILETTI, are out for a 
night on the town.

Tony is second generation Italian-American with very 
Mediterranean features. They're listening to Teenage Fan 
Club. They pass Ghierardeli Square.

          CHARLIE
     Tony, Teenage Fan Club, they're 
     Scottish you know?

          TONY
     Oh.

          CHARLIE
     I had that dream again.

          TONY
     Oh, is that the one where you suspect 
     that a fat man in a diaper, on a 
     lazy susan has interfered with your 
     plans for the evening?

          CHARLIE
     No, but I have had that one. No, in 
     this one I'm in love...

          TONY
     Yeah.

          CHARLIE
     And I say to myself, 'I've finally 
     found somebody that I'm truly 
     comfortable with.' You know when 
     you're so comfortable that you'll 
     let them put makeup on you to see 
     what you would look like if you were 
     a girl. Anyways you know what I do 
     in the dream next?

          TONY
     You propose?

          CHARLIE
          (after a pause)
     No. I die.

          TONY
     But Charlie, you're a normal suburban 
     guy at heart, from a normal suburban 
     family. Didn't you tell me you always 
     wanted to get married and have a 
     family.

          CHARLIE
     Yes, but, I'm afraid, okay? There 
     are seven main rites of passage in a 
     man's life. Birth, first day of 
     school, last day of school. Marriage. 
     Kids. Retirement. Death. I'm at 
     marriage. I'm two rites of passage 
     away from death.

          TONY
     I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.

Tony is doing three-sixties, scoping out beauties, when 
suddenly his roving eyes lock on a police car directly behind 
them. He slouches down into his seat.

          TONY
     Christ. It's the cops.

          CHARLIE
     Tony, you are a cop.

          TONY
     I know. Isn't it awful? I work with 
     those guys. They're assholes.

The police car passes.

INT. SPILETTI'S COFFEE HOUSE - NIGHT

Tony and Charlie enter. There is a poet on stage. The club 
is full of art tarts and college bohemians. They are greeted 
by the club's owner, GIUSEPPI, an Italian man in his fifties.

          TONY
     Salve zio mio.

          UNCLE
     Allora? Che catzo fai, Charlie?

          CHARLIE
     Hi, Uncle Giuseppi.

          UNCLE
     Tony, come' stai bello il tuo pappa 
     e' in galera per la terza volta.

Tony's uncle shows them to a table.

          UNCLE
     I'll have the waitress bring you 
     cappuccino.

          CHARLIE
     What did your uncle say?

          TONY
     He says my Dad's back in jail again.

          CHARLIE
     Ah, I'm sorry, man.

          TONY
     You know, it's funny I don't even 
     feel related to my parents anymore. 
     I feel like your mom and dad are 
     more like my parents. I feel more 
     Scottish than Italian.

          CHARLIE
     Tony Spiletti, I don't think you 
     could get more Italian than that. 
     Unless of course your name was Tony 
     Italian Guy.

Charlie checks out the girls in the coffee bar.

          CHARLIE
     I'm so bummed. Sherri was great, 
     wasn't she? I'm an asshole, aren't 
     I?

          TONY
     Yes.

          CHARLIE
     You've got to help me get through 
     this night.

          TONY
     You've just got to get back on the 
     horse.

The waitress arrives with two cappuccinos in extremely large 
cups like they have in France.

          CHARLIE
     Waitress, I'm sorry, there seems to 
     be a mistake. I ordered the large 
     cappuccino.

Two girls at a nearby table, laugh. Charlie and Tony exchange, 
"This could be promising." looks.

          CHARLIE
          (to the girls)
     Do you think these cups could be 
     larger? They're practically bowls.

The girls laugh again.

          CHARLIE
     I feel like I'm having Campbell's 
     Cuppuccino.

          TONY
     Join us in a cup of coffee? There's 
     enough room?

          GIRLS
     Sure!

The girls come over.

          SUSAN
     My name's Susan and this is June. We 
     think you're funny.

          TONY
     My name's Tony. This is my friend 
     Charlie.

          CHARLIE
     Look, Tony, I'm going home. See you 
     later, girls.

Tony grabs him and pulls him aside.

          TONY
     You really don't understand, do you? 
     When a girl comes over to your table 
     and says, 'I think you're funny.' It 
     means you've pretty much been given 
     the keys to the city. Charlie, this 
     is big.

          CHARLIE
     Perhaps you've confused me with 
     someone who gives a shit. Here's 
     what's gonna happen, Tony. We'll end 
     up going out with them tonight, maybe 
     even home with them. Well go out for 
     two months. Soon she'll move in, 
     we'll be happy, She'll want more of 
     a commitment. I'll be terrified and 
     I'll do something to ruin it. Just 
     like I did with Sherri.

He leaves. Tony is left with the two girls.

          JUNE
     Poor, guy... He seemed so nice.

          TONY
          (talking, choked up)
     I just broke up with somebody as 
     well. She left me high and dry.

The girls try to comfort him.

INT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT

Three quarters of the furnishings and items have disappeared 
with Sherri. Charlie sits dejectedly on the floor over his 
Poetry Journal. He is missing Sherri. We see...

CHARLIE'S FACE

He looks out and is struck by an idea and begins to write.

ANGLE ON THE JOURNAL

               I AM LONELY

CHARLIE'S FACE

Again he looks out, finds his inspiration and continues to 
write

IN THE JOURNAL

          IT'S REALLY HARD

CHARLIE'S FACE

A gentle tear rolls down his left cheek. He pauses, then 
finishes off the stanza.

IN THE JOURNAL

          THIS POEM SUCKS

After the last line he scratches out the entire poem. He 
closes the book and turns on the TV set to CNN to veg out. 
The show is "What's Cooking! With Burt Wolf."

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET

Charlie is driving in his car. He drives slowly looking for 
an address. Finds it, slips in to a parking spot in front.

EXT. BUTCHER'S SHOP - MEATS OF THE WORLD

Adorning the front are a "GRAND OPENING" sign and miniature 
flags of the world. Charlie goes inside.

INT. BUTCHER'S SHOP

It's a small, hip shop selling specialty meats from around 
the world. Charlie looks around. Suddenly, an attractive 
woman in her late twenties, wearing a blood-stained smock 
enters. It is HARRIET MICHAELS. She has a cleaver in one 
hand and something bloody in the other.

          HARRIET
          (angry)
     Goddamn shoplifter.
          (conscious of Charlie's 
          presence; holding up 
          bloody meat)
     But I got him!
          (smiles)
     You're next.

          CHARLIE
          (backing out the door; 
          terrified)
     I've come at a bad time.

          HARRIET
     No stay!

          CHARLIE
     No, no, really... Obviously you've 
     got things you have to do. You've 
     got to dismember the rest of his 
     bloody torso. Dig a makeshift shallow 
     grave. Cover the body with quick 
     lime. Really so much to do, so little 
     time and I'm only in the way here, 
     I'm just gonna go. Good luck.

          HARRIET
          (referring to meat in 
          hand)
     Oh, this! Oh, no, this is what he 
     stole. This isn't a piece of him or 
     anything. This is Icelandic Shank.

          CHARLIE
     I bet it goes well with a nice 
     Chianti. Fittfittfitt.

          HARRIET
          (laughs)
     Can I help you?

          CHARLIE
     Yes. Do you have haggis?

          HARRIET
     Yes, we do. It's over here in our 
     Scottish Cuts section. One?

This is a section under glass flying a Scottish flag, with 
haggis and various cuts of Scottish meat.

          CHARLIE
     Yes! I've never been able to find 
     haggis anywhere, except at my parents' 
     house. They're Scottish.

Harriet rounds the counter and wraps up the haggis. Behind 
her is the large "PRUSSIAN VENISON" sign.

          HARRIET
          (ringing up his order)
     That'll be fifteen, seventy-nine. 
     Will there be anything else?

          CHARLIE
     Yes. I know it's a long shot, but 
     you wouldn't by any chance happen to 
     have any Prussian Venison?

          HARRIET
     Now where in the world would I get 
     Prussian Venison?

Charlie's charmed.

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET

Charlie is driving along listening to Kerouac. We absorb the 
flavor of San Francisco as he drives down Lombard Street.

EXT. CHARLIE'S PARENTS' APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

An old crappie apartment building in San Francisco. Charlie's 
car pulls up. We hear "SATURDAY NIGHT" by the Bay City 
Rollers.

INT. OUTER HALLWAY OF CHARLIE'S PARENTS' APARTMENT - NIGHT

Charlie approaches a door.

          CHARLIE
          (calling up)
     Mom, Dad, I'm here.

          STUART (O.S.)
     We're in here, son.

The apartment is a shrine to Scotland. Scottish paraphernalia, 
miniature Scotty dogs, shortbread tins and, on wall, framed 
pictures depict famous Scotsmen, Sean Connery, Jackie Stewart, 
Alexander Graham Bell, James Doohan (Scottie from "Star 
Trek"), Sheena Easton, Billy Connolly.

CHARLIE'S POV - AS WE ENTER THE LIVING ROOM

We see STUART, MAY, TONY, and little WILLIAM, Charlie's 
fourteen year old little brother all singing:

          ALL
          (singing)
     S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y... NIGHT

          STUART
          (noticing Charlie)
     Come give your old man a kiss or 
     I'll kick your teeth in.

The group are eating dinner on TV trays. Charlie walks over 
and turns off the record.

          MAY
     Charlie, put on Charlie Pride, would 
     ya? Oh, I love Charlie Pride.
          (begins singing; in 
          thick Scottish accent)
     HEY, DID YOU HAPPEN TO SEE THE MOST 
     BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN THE WORLD...

          STUART
     May, shut it.

STUART MACKENZIE is in his late fifties, a butcher, with 
Coke bottle glasses and thick head of black hair. His red-
haired wife, MAY, is in her fifties, attractive with a soft, 
but tough appearance. Little WILLIAM, has a very large head 
and a skinny neck. Like Charlie, he was born in America.

Charlie gives his Mom a hug, his father a kiss.

          CHARLIE
     Hey, William.

          WILLIAM
          (on his stomach on 
          the floor; watching 
          TV)
     Hey, Charlie.

          STUART
     SCORES! MAGIC GOAL!

On the television, Stuart's team, Glasgow Celtic, has scored.

          TONY
     Aye -- magic.

          STUART
     Let's have a look at the re-play. 
     William, move your head. Look at the 
     size of that ooy's heed. I'm not 
     kidding. It's like an orange on a 
     tooth pick.

          MAY
     Stuart, you're going to give the boy 
     a complex.

          STUART
     I'm not kidding. That's a huge 
     noggin'. It has it's own weather 
     system. It's a virtual planetoid.
          (shouting to William)
     Heed! Move!

We see the re-play of the goal on TV. Tony sits down and May 
brings over a plate of stew and three types of potatoes, 
piled very high.

          MAY
     Is that enough potatoes, Charlie?

          CHARLIE
     Enough to recreate Devil's Tower in 
     "Close Encounters".

          STUART
          (sniffs the air)
     Do I smell haggis?

          CHARLIE
     Aye, you do.

          MAY
          (taking it)
     I'll put it in the frig.

Charlie notices Tony reading some papers. He realizes it's 
literature from the Lyndon H. LaRouche Society.

          CHARLIE
     Dad, what are you doing to Tony now? 
     Why do you abuse his mind like this?

          STUART
     That's the latest report from Lyndon 
     H. LaRouche, outlining how the Queen 
     and the Rothschilds masterminded the 
     Soviet overthrow, so that they could 
     reclaim lands they had annexed during 
     the Holy Roman Empire.

          TONY
          (goading Charlie)
     You know a lot of this makes sense.

          CHARLIE
     I think you're suffering from the 
     Stockholm Syndrome, where the hostages 
     start to relate to their captors.

          STUART
     Listen, Sonny Jim, it's a known fact 
     there's a society of the five 
     wealthiest people in the world, called 
     the Pentaverate, who run everything 
     and meet three times a year at a 
     secret country mansion in Colorado, 
     known as "The Meadows."

          CHARLIE
          (sarcastic)
     And that's obviously why we haven't 
     heard about it in the newspapers.

          STUART
          (inappropriately angry 
          & loud)
     That's right. They fuckin' own the 
     papers, smartass. And everything 
     else. Why do you think Scotland's 
     not been able to get independence? 
     Because the Queen the Pentavirate 
     and those English dome heads in West 
     Minster won't have it.

          CHARLIE
     Who are the other members of this 
     pentaverate?

          STUART
     The Queen, the Rothchilds, the Gettys, 
     the Vatican, and Colonel Sanders 
     before he went tits up. Oh, I hated 
     the Colonel with his wee beady eyes. 
     And that smug look on his face.

          CHARLIE
     Dad how can you hate "the Colonel?"

          STUART
     Because the Colonel puts an addictive 
     chemical in it that makes you crave 
     it fortnightly.

          CHARLIE
     Interesting... coo-coo

          MAY
     Would anyone like a juice? Charlie, 
     did I tell you, we bought a Juice 
     Tiger?

          CHARLIE
     A Juice Tiger?

          MAY
     Aye, it's a juicer. It's part of my 
     National Enquirer, Garth Brooks diet. 
     Would you like potato juice?

          CHARLIE
     Thank you, no.

          MAY
     Sherri's late.

          CHARLIE
     Yeah, uh, Sherri and I broke up.

          MAY
     Oh, you didn't. Sherri was the 
     daughter your father was never able 
     to give me.

          CHARLIE
     I'm just not ready for marriage. I'm 
     twenty-nine and my poems haven't 
     even been published yet.

          STUART
     But it's not just the poetry is it 
     son? You're afraid if you get married 
     you'll lose your muse. Look at me, I 
     was a strapping young butcher, at 
     the height of my creative powers. 
     When it came to de-boning a side of 
     beef, there was nobody that could 
     touch me. Then I married your mother. 
     And people would still stand in awe 
     as I filleted a shoulder of lamb.

          MAY
     Maybe it's just as well not to get 
     married, look at the news. Where did 
     I put it?

          STUART
     Heed. Move that melon of yours into 
     the bathroom and get the paper for 
     your mother.

William gets the National Enquirer and brings it back.

          CHARLIE
     That's not news, Dad. That's bullshit. 
     I wouldn't wipe my ass with that 
     paper.

          STUART
     What are you talking about? It's the 
     fifth highest circulating paper in 
     the United States, I'll have you 
     know.

          MAY
     Oh, here it is. Mrs. X. The Honeymoon 
     Murderer. She marries men under fake 
     identities, and then murders them. 
     She killed some German martial arts 
     expert, and some plumber named Ralph 
     Elliot. Her whereabouts are unknown.

There's another goal on the TV set.

          STUART
     Scores! Two nil. Magic!

          TONY
     Ah, beautiful goal. We HOLD on the 
     TV set.

Time passes. The TV set

                                   CROSS FADES:

TO THE END OF THE GAME

The two teams are shaking hands. And the final scores chyron 
shows Celtic beating Rangers three nothing. We see Charlie 
and Tony are leaving. Stuart is blind drunk.

          STUART
          (singing Rod Stewart's 
          song)
     YOU'RE IN MY EYES, YOU'RE IN MY 
     DREAMS...
     YOU'RE CELTIC, UNITED 
     AND BABY I'VE DECIDED...

          MAY
     Ah, you're steaming.

She meets Charlie and Tony at the door and kisses him good-
bye. She turns to kiss Tony, and holds on the kiss far too 
long.

          TONY
          (pulling away)
     See you later, Mrs. MacKenzie.

          MAY
     Oh, you've turned into a sexy Italian 
     bastard.

          CHARLIE
     See you later, mom.
          (calling out)
     See you later, Dad.

          STUART
     Fine. Go! You've stayed your hour.

Charlie and Tony leave and enter...

THE HALLWAY

where they find William sitting on the stairs waiting for 
them.

          WILLIAM
     Take me with you.

EXT. MEATS OF THE WORLD - LATE AFTERNOON

Charlie's drives by and notices Harriet, who's unwinding the 
store awning in Dutch national costume. The banner announces 
"DUTCH WEEK." "MEATS OF THE WORLD SALUTES DUTCH MEAT."

Charlie slows down to look at her. She looks great in her 
little Dutch costume.

INT. CITY LIGHTS BOOKSTORE - DAY

Charlie is again writing at the counter. Another PERSON 
enters.

          MAN
     Excuse me. You wouldn't happen to 
     have...

Charlie again points to the Kerouac section without looking 
up.

          MAN
     Thanks.

ON THE PAD

Charlie writes...

OH MEAT MAID, 
IF THE CATTLE HAD HAD A CHOICE, THEY WOULD HAVE SLAUGHTERED 
THEMSELVES 
WILLINGLY 
FOR A CHANCE 
TO BE TOUCHED 
BY YOUR FINGERS

                                   CUT TO:

CHARLIE'S FACE

She's on his mind.

EXT. MEATS OF THE WORLD

Charlie's car pulls up. The sign reads, "WELSH WEEK" "MEATS 
OF THE WORLD SALUTES WELSH MEATS"

INT. MEATS OF THE WORLD

The store is very busy. There is a line at the meat counter 
seven people deep. Charlie takes his place at the end of the 
line.

We see a montage of a persons hands chopping a rack of lamb 
into lamb chops, and carving meat with surgical efficiency.

          HARRIET
          (spotting Charlie in 
          the crowd)
     Oh, hi haggis, right?

          CHARLIE
     It was a big hit.

          HARRIET
          (finishing up with a 
          customer)
     I remember you told me you were 
     Scottish, but do you really like 
     haggis.

          CHARLIE
     No. I think it's repellent in every 
     way. In fact, I think most Scottish 
     cuisine is based on a dare.

Harriet laughs.

          HARRIET
          (to the next customer)
     Can I help you?
          (to Charlie)
     Sorry, I'm really busy.

          CHARLIE
     Look, um, my dad's a butcher, do you 
     need a hand?

          HARRIET
     Well, actually, Yes.

Charlie puts on a very stylish butcher smock and crosses 
behind the counter.

          HARRIET
     Can you get me four Belgian 
     porterhouses? Do you know what a 
     porterhouse looks like?

          CHARLIE
     I'm meat literate.

Time passes we see a montage of Harriet and Charlie serving 
customers. Ending on a customer's POV of Charlie.

          CUSTOMER (O.S.)
     Yes, do you have any fresh blubber?

          CHARLIE
     I'll check.
          (pause)
     You want blubber, right?

          CUSTOMER
     Yeah.

We see Charlie's POV of an Eskimo with a "lower forty-eighth" 
accent.

          CUSTOMER
     My parents are coming to town. You 
     know how parents are. They'll drive 
     you nuts.

The Eskimo exits, there are no customers left.

          HARRIET
     Look, I'm really grateful. Can I 
     offer you some meat as payment? 
     Please, help yourself to some meat.

          CHARLIE
     I'm trying to be a vegetarian.

          HARRIET
     Trying to be a vegetarian?

          CHARLIE
     Yeah, the problem is I really love 
     hot-dogs.

          HARRIET
     I think the meat industry invented 
     hot-dogs to stop people from becoming 
     vegetarians. There's got to be 
     something I can do to repay you.

          CHARLIE
     You could take me to a nice romantic 
     dinner.

EXT. PIER - NIGHT

Charlie and Harriet are eating hot-dogs. As Charlie puts the 
relish on, he smells the relish.

          CHARLIE
          (sniffing the relish)
     This reminds me of my ex-girlfriend.

          HARRIET
     I hate talking about old 
     relationships.

          CHARLIE
     Then let's not and say we did.

          HARRIET
          (she laughs)
     That was easy -- What a nice guy. 
     You've probably never done a mean 
     thing in your life.

          CHARLIE
     You'd be surprised.

          HARRIET
     I'd like to hear.
          (to his confused look)
     Name me something bad you've done in 
     your life.

          CHARLIE
     Are you kidding me?

          HARRIET
     No. Did you ever steal anything? You 
     ever hit someone?

          CHARLIE
     Well, I've been in fights. Let me 
     think.

          HARRIET
          (as Charlie thinks)
     Not one bad thing, Charlie?

          CHARLIE
     Tell me something bad you've done. 
     And it better be bad. I mean, evil.

          HARRIET
     How evil?

          CHARLIE
     Really evil.
          (thinks)
     Like how many people have you brutally 
     murdered?

          HARRIET
     "Brutal" is such a subjective word. 
     I mean, what's brutal to one person 
     might be totally reasonable to 
     another.

Next to them is a German couple, speaking German, looking 
through a coin-operated binocular. He says something which 
causes her to cry.

          CHARLIE
     This just reminded her of that scene 
     in "Brian's Song".

          HARRIET
     Actually, he just proposed to her. 
     Those are tears of joy.

She lifts her soda to toast them.

          HARRIET
     Prost.

The man and woman smile and nod.

          MAN
     Danke, Fraulein.

          CHARLIE
     You're very smart. It's a shame I'm 
     going to have to destroy you.

          HARRIET
     Do bright women intimidate you?

          CHARLIE
     No, not at all.

          HARRIET
     Really, what do you look for in women 
     you date?

          CHARLIE
          (thinks)
     Well, I know everyone always say 
     "sense of humor", but I'd have to go 
     with breast size.
          (she laughs)
     How about you? In a guy.

          HARRIET
     Income of course, and then...
          (thinks)
     ...savings.

He smiles at her.

          CHARLIE
     Me likey how you thinkey.

INT. HARRIET'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The lights turn on, and then they enter a very bohemian 
apartment. There is artists paraphernalia strewn around. A 
small bar separates the living area from the kitchen. She 
smiles and walks off into the kitchen.

          HARRIET
     I'll make us some tea.

He checks out her apartment. On the wall there is a huge 
poster of the BOARDWALK IN ATLANTIC CITY.

          CHARLIE
     Hey, you know what this apartment 
     needs? A really large oversized poster 
     of Atlantic City.

          HARRIET
     I used to live there. That's where I 
     had my first supermarket job.

On his way out, he peeks into the bedroom, where he finds a 
bed that is facing neither parallel nor perpendicular with 
the wall. It is just kind of "there".

          HARRIET (O.S.)
          (coming into room)
     I only have chamomile. I hope that's 
     all right.

He looks at her and then at the "Oddly-placed" bed.

          HARRIET
     It's North-South.
          (to his confused look)
     For health reasons. See... I had 
     this friend, he was a martial arts 
     expert. Anyways, he used to sleep 
     North-South. I don't know... It's a 
     martial arts thing and it just sort 
     of became a habit with me.

          CHARLIE
          (walking into living 
          room)
     You know Scotland has it's own martial 
     arts. It's called FUCKU. It's mostly 
     head butting and kicking people when 
     they're on the ground.

Harriet starts laughing. Then so does Charlie. They lean 
into each other. Pretty close. Too close even, and when it 
seems like they're going to kiss, Charlie suddenly gets 
uncomfortable and looks at his watch.

          HARRIET
     Late?

          CHARLIE
     No. No. Not for me.

          HARRIET
     Who for then?

          CHARLIE
     Who for then what?

          HARRIET
     Well, you looked at your watch and 
     said it wasn't late for you... I 
     wondered who it was late for.

          CHARLIE
     Not me. No, Sir. Not here.
          (after a pause; 
          checking watch)
     Maybe it is late.

She gets him his coat. He starts to leave.

          CHARLIE
     Look, the truth is, yes, I had a 
     great time, and I'd like to kiss 
     you, but if we do kiss, then we'll 
     kiss on the couch and if we kiss on 
     the couch, then we'll kiss in the 
     bedroom, and once you're in the 
     bedroom -- Well, the thing is, I 
     always rush it. And this time I feel 
     like maybe I should wait. Maybe we 
     should let it build naturally and 
     grow, instead of just immediately 
     spending the night together.

          HARRIET
     I want to spend the night together.

          CHARLIE
          (sold)
     I have no problem with that.

THE BEDROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

They are both fast asleep. She is curled up in his arms. 
Suddenly, she begins to speak.

          HARRIET
     Yes! Yes!

Charlie's eyes open. He smiles.

          HARRIET
     Yes Ralph. I will. Ralph.

Charlie's smile fades. He sits up and looks at her. She is 
lying completely still on the bed, her eyes closed, and still 
sleep-talking.

          HARRIET (O.S.)
     Now now Ralph!

          CHARLIE
          (waking her)
     Harriet...? Harriet...?
          (as her eyes open)
     You were having a dream, or...? You 
     kept saying the name Ralph.

          HARRIET
     Ralph?

          CHARLIE
     Ralph. I heard you say it.

          HARRIET
          (sleepily)
     That's odd. Just today I was thinking 
     about, her. She's a friend.

          CHARLIE
          (starting to leave)
     Is she nice --? Ralph...

          HARRIET
     Yeah. She's great.

                                             DISSOLVE INTO:

INT. HARRIET'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Charlie is sleeping alone in the bed, and the sound of RUNNING 
WATER is heard off in the distance. His eyes slowly open, he 
looks around, remembers where he is. He puts on his shorts 
and walks towards the bathroom.

INT. BATHROOM - MORNING

Through the steam we can just make out Harriet in the shower 
washing her hair. Charlie walks over.

          CHARLIE
     You know... with this drought in 
     California total strangers are urged 
     to shower together.

He opens the curtain. It's not Harriet. The woman, ROSE, 
calmly looks at him and closes the curtain.

          ROSE
     Go away.

          CHARLIE
     Oh God. I'm sorry. Jesus. Excuse me.

He backs out of the room.

INT. HALLWAY - HARRIET'S APARTMENT

The door opens and a hurriedly dressed Charlie emerges. Before 
he gets to the door he once again encounters Rose. She's 
completely dressed. Even her hair is dry.

          CHARLIE
     Hi. I'm really sorry. I must have 
     scared the... I'm Harriet's friend, 
     Charlie, and you must be...
          (hopefully)
     Ralph?

          ROSE
     I'm Harriet's sister, Rose. And this 
     is Harriet's note.

He reaches for it, but she reads it aloud to him.

          ROSE
          (reading)
     'Dear Charlie, I didn't want to wake 
     you, make yourself at home, thanks 
     for making me smile.' Harriet.

          CHARLIE
     That's a very nice note.

          ROSE
     I'll make you some breakfast.

          CHARLIE
     Gee, I'd love to but I'm running 
     late.

          ROSE
     What would you say to blueberry 
     pancakes, bacon, fresh squeezed grape 
     juice and Kona coffee?

INT. KITCHEN - LATER

Charlie and Rose sit at the table each eating a bowl of dry 
cereal.

          ROSE
     I'm sorry I didn't have any of those 
     other things.

          CHARLIE
     Hey, that stuff'll kill you while 
     Fruit Loops are light and probably 
     reasonably high in Fiber. I like 
     Apple Jacks too.

          ROSE
     Got 'em.

          CHARLIE
     So this is your apartment?

Rose starts sketching Charlie.

          ROSE
     Yes. She's been here the past three 
     months... ever since she came back 
     from Miami. I used to visit her 
     occasionally. She didn't speak of 
     me?

          CHARLIE
          (shakes his head, no)
     She told me about a martial arts guy 
     and there was some discussion about 
     Ralph...

          ROSE
     She spoke of them...?

          CHARLIE
     She spoke of the martial arts guy 
     and screamed about Ralph...

          ROSE
          (affectionately)
     Well, you know Harriet.

          CHARLIE
     Actually, I really don't.

          ROSE
          (puzzled)
     But you did have sex with her?

          CHARLIE
          (taken aback)
     Hello.

          ROSE
     Yet you still don't know her.
          (contemplates this)
     See, that's the problem with sex. 
     It's not very revealing.

          CHARLIE
     My, look at the time.

He stands up.

          ROSE
          (after a pause)
     You should be careful, Charlie.

          CHARLIE
     I am... usually. I just... You should 
     know, this is very unusual that I 
     would do this so soon, in this day 
     and age particularly, but... We just 
     really hit it off. We did. And...

          ROSE
     I'm gonna go now. I won't tell Harriet 
     that anything happened.

          CHARLIE
     But... nothing did happen.

          ROSE
     Exactly. Or she would be jealous. 
     And when she gets jealous, we both 
     know what she's capable of.

          CHARLIE
     No, we don't. You do, like I said, I 
     just met her.

          ROSE
     You'll be okay, Charlie. Just be 
     careful.

She leaves. Charlie is baffled.

INT. CITY LIGHTS BOOKSTORE - DAY

As Charlie walks by, FRED, a lanky customer in his late teens 
is buying a book.

          FRED
     Hey, Charlie. How you doin'?

          CHARLIE
     Good. Good. Look, Fred...
          (leaning in)
     You got a lot of girlfriends, right? 
     You know any girls named Ralph?

          FRED
     Ralph? Gee, Charlie. Isn't that a 
     guy's name?

          CHARLIE
     Well, not necessarily, but... Never 
     mind. Thanks, Fred.

Charlie catches the store manager, PENNY, on her way into 
her office.

          CHARLIE
     Hey Penny, I wanted to ask you -- 
     you know some girls named Ralph, 
     right? I mean, that's a girl's name 
     also, isn't it?

          PENNY
          (confused)
     I don't think so, Charlie... Uh...

          CHARLIE
          (walking away)
     Forget it. Thanks.

She walks into her office totally confused.

EXT. DOCKSIDE - ALCATRAZ TOUR KIOSK - MAINLAND - DAY

Tony and Charlie are waiting in line.

AERIAL VIEW OF BOAT

as they travel to the island.

          TONY (V.O.)
     You know I've lived in this city all 
     my life and I've never been to 
     Alcatraz.

ALCATRAZ

We open on the LOUD BANGING of a CELL DOOR. We find our tour 
group in the holding area. The PARK RANGER is a beefy man in 
his late fifties and talks with emotionless, military 
precision.

          PARK RANGER
     Hello, everyone I'm a park ranger 
     and I will be leading you on the 
     tour. All the park rangers here at 
     Alcatraz were at one time guards, 
     myself included. My name is John 
     Johnson, but everyone here calls me 
     Vicki. Will you please follow me?

They are led out. We see that Alcatraz is a sinister place. 
Cold and unforgiving. The Park Ranger leads them to the center 
of a cell block.

          TONY
     You're glowing, Charlie. The man's 
     in love.

          CHARLIE
     Sssh... Stop it. I'm trying to listen.

          PARK RANGER
     This is the main cell block area. 
     Home to such famous criminals as Al 
     Capone, Micky Cohen, Joseph "Dutch" 
     Critzer, and Robert Stroud, the famous 
     Bird Man of Alcatraz. Follow me, 
     please.

The Park Ranger leads them past the famous visiting rooms, 
the mess hall, all the way to the solitary confinement area.

A CELL

          PARK RANGER
     This is the cell for solitary 
     confinement, that over the years has 
     come to be known as Times Square.

Tony and Charlie are at the back of the tour group.

          TONY
     So did you and Harriet?... you know...

          CHARLIE
          (grinning)
     Sssh I don't want to talk about it.

          TONY
     With that look, you don't have to 
     talk about it. The grin alone could 
     get you five to seven years.

          CHARLIE
     Tony, get your mind out of the gutter. 
     All you need to know is that she's a 
     sweet, kind and loving person.

          PARK RANGER
     Now this is something none of the 
     other tour guides will tell you. In 
     this particular cell block Machine 
     Gunn Kelly had, what we call in the 
     prison system, a "bitch." And one 
     day, in a jealous rage, Kelly took a 
     makeshift knife, or "shiv," and cut 
     out his "bitch's" eyes.

          CHARLIE
     Look, what can I tell you. I'm 
     smitten. I'm in deep smit. I dunno. 
     I just don't wanna talk about it, 
     because then I start analyzing and 
     that's not good for me.

          TONY
     Good. I think that's good. Just let 
     it happen.

          CHARLIE
     Exactly. That's what's gonna be 
     different this time. Something strange 
     happens, let it go. It's not my 
     business... Like Ralph. She says 
     Ralph in her sleep.

          TONY
     Who's Ralph?

          CHARLIE
     I don't know who Ralph is. Moreover, 
     I don't want to know.

          TONY
     Good.

          PARK RANGER
     And as if blinding his "bitch" wasn't 
     enough retribution for Kelly, the 
     next day he and four other inmates 
     took turns pissing into the "bitch's" 
     ocular cavity.

Tony and Charlie look at each other. They're a little queasy.

          CHARLIE
     Exactly.
          (beat)
     Tony, I'm happy. Don't let me screw 
     this one up.

INT. EL TORO - IN THE MISSION - DAY

They are eating Bay burrites.

          ROSE
     Did you have a nice date last night?

          HARRIET
     Rose, I don't really --

          ROSE
     He disturbed me while I was naked in 
     the shower this morning.

          HARRIET
     Yeah, he stayed over?

          ROSE
     I didn't mind. Charlie and I laughed 
     about it over breakfast.

          HARRIET
     That's good.

          ROSE
     He said you had great sex last night.

          HARRIET
     He did?
          (a beat)
     Yeah.

          ROSE
     He seems really stuck on you. I hope 
     for you that it lasts.

          HARRIET
     Rose he's a sweet, kind and loving 
     person. We like each other, but I 
     don't want to think any further. 
     It's taken me a long time to get 
     back to dating, and I want to take 
     things real steady this time.

          ROSE
     Well, you can trust me not to tell 
     him anything.

          HARRIET
     He was quite happy not to talk about 
     the past.

          ROSE
     I did a sketch of him.

Rose shows the sketch to Harriet.

          HARRIET
          (looking at the picture)
     That's good.

          ROSE
     Think I've caught him?

          HARRIET
     The eyes are good.

          ROSE
     Charlie really liked it.

          HARRIET
     It's a good likeness.

          ROSE
     Boy, I really hope it works out.

          HARRIET
     Rose, I don't wanna screw this one 
     up.

EXT. HARRIET'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Charlie enters the building, holding a handful of poetry 
books. He passes a UNIFORMED DELIVERY GUY coming out. The 
guy nods and Charlie nods back.

INT. HARRIET'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

Charlie gets three feet down the hallway. Stops in his tracks 
and heads back to the front door. He opens it and yells to 
the delivery guy:

          CHARLIE
     Hey, uh... Ralph...?

          DELIVERY GUY
          (turning around)
     I'm Gilbert.

          CHARLIE
     Shit.

HARRIET'S DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

She opens the door enough to see that she is wearing only a 
blouse that goes below her hips. She looks fantastic. He 
hands her the poetry books.

          HARRIET
          (teasing him)
     Charlie, they're beautiful. I'll put 
     them right in water.

He follows her inside and puts the books on the bureau. He 
goes over and kisses her.

          CHARLIE
     You look great.

          HARRIET
     I was just getting dressed.
          (picking up skirt off 
          couch)
     What do you think of this skirt?

          CHARLIE
     Honestly?
          (pulls her close)
     I'd leave it off.

          HARRIET
     So then you think I could go to a 
     poetry concert like this?

She drops the skirt and stands there. She's fantastic.

          CHARLIE
     Let's forget the poetry concert. 
     It's already been nine hours since I 
     last made love to you.

          HARRIET
          (smiling; walking 
          away)
     Come on we're meeting your best 
     friend. I wanna look good. The second 
     I go to the ladies room he's gonna 
     tell you what he really thinks of 
     me.

He follows her to the bedroom door, constantly trying to 
kiss her.

          HARRIET
     Come on, Charlie. We have to be there 
     in fifteen minutes.

          CHARLIE
          (following her into 
          bedroom)
     Fifteen minutes. Perfect.

She closes the door on his face.

          CHARLIE
          (through door)
     Maybe later.

          ROSE (O.S.)
     I thought of calling you.

          CHARLIE
          (startled)
     Aaaahhh!

Charlie turns on his heel. Rose has appeared out of nowhere.

          ROSE
          (after a pause)
     To warn you, Charlie.
          (after a pause)
     There are just some things you should 
     know, about Harriet.

          CHARLIE
     About Harriet?

          ROSE
     About her past.

          CHARLIE
     I don't wanna know. I mean, look 
     everyone has some skeletons in their 
     past. I only care about the future. 
     Not the past.

          ROSE
     Here's the thing. I may have to tell 
     Harriet.

          CHARLIE
     Tell her what?

          ROSE
     That we're lovers.

          CHARLIE
     We're not lovers.

          ROSE
     I know, and it's a damn shame.

Harriet walks in the room, fully dressed, and fully dazzling.

          HARRIET
     I hope I'm not interrupting.

          CHARLIE
          (feeling weird)
     No, not at all. We were just talking 
     about... Rose and I met yesterday, 
     so...

          HARRIET
     So I heard.

Harriet hugs Rose and then stands right next to her.

          HARRIET
     So, don't you think we look alike?

          ROSE
     Oh, we do not. Harriet was always 
     prettier than me. And a heck of a 
     lot more popular. She always had 
     boyfriends. The only thing I ever 
     got was good grades.

          CHARLIE
          (slightly uncomfortable)
     Good grades are good.

          HARRIET
     She's just being kind. Show Charlie 
     one of your photographs, Rose. Rose 
     is a great artist.

          ROSE
     No, Harriet. I don't want to. They're 
     not good.

          HARRIET
     You're so modest. If I weren't here 
     to brag for you, I just don't know...
          (taking out a 
          posterboard from 
          cabinet)
     Show it to him, Rose. Do it.

He turns it over and there is a picture there. A collage of 
unrelated images put together. And it is beautiful.

But it's very abstract. Violent perhaps. Confused definitely. 
He likes it.

          CHARLIE
     It's beautiful...

          ROSE
     Thanks.

          CHARLIE
     What is it?

          ROSE
     I dunno.

          CHARLIE
     What do you call it?

          ROSE
     I dunno.

          CHARLIE
     A lot artists don't like to title 
     their work. They feel it biases the 
     viewer.

          ROSE
     It is titled. It's called "I dunno".

Charlie looks at it again, then at Rose, then at Harriet. 
It's all a little bizarre, but in a funny way he feels for 
Rose. A hidden talented overshadowed by her sister's beauty.

          HARRIET
     We should get going, Charlie. Thanks, 
     Rose... See you later.

          ROSE
     Bye, Charlie.

          CHARLIE
     Rose, great to see you. We should 
     all go out together some time. The 
     three of us. That would be great. 
     That would be... interesting.

Charlie and Harriet walk out.

EXT. POETRY FESTIVAL - NIGHT

Charlie and Harriet wait in line with bohemian types and 
poetry lovers from the suburbs, and all walks of life. 
Directly behind them are TWO OLD LADIES. The marquee reads: 
"POETRY FESTIVAL - TONIGHT ALLEN GINSBERG."

          CHARLIE
     I think you're going to love Alan 
     Ginsberg. He's great.

          HARRIET
     Oh, I know all about him.

          TONY (O.S.)
     Hey Charlie!

Tony is getting out of a cab accompanied by Susan, the girl 
from Spiletti's Coffee House. He approaches Charlie.

          TONY
     Sorry we're late.

Tony throws his arms wide open and hugs one of the Little 
Old Ladies on the other side of Charlie.

          TONY
     You must be Harriet. I've heard a 
     lot about you.

          CHARLIE
          (to Tony; re: Harriet)
     This is Harriet.

          TONY
     Oh. Sorry. Of course.
          (whispering to Harriet)
     I apologize. Charlie described you 
     as much older. And heavier.

          HARRIET
          (smiling)
     Oh, he did...?

          CHARLIE
     Thank you, Tony. This is my best 
     friend.

          TONY
     And this is Susan. Charlie, you 
     remember her from Uncle Giuseppi's.

          CHARLIE
     Yes, I do.

          SUSAN
     You're funny...

Then she GIGGLES. The girls start inside, Tony lags back 
with Charlie.

          TONY
          (whispers to Charlie)
     I give Susan one night.

INT. POETRY FESTIVAL - NIGHT

ALLEN GINSBERG is on stage. He is brilliant. Tony, Charlie, 
and Harriet are all amused. Susan is bored stiff. Charlie is 
looking at Tony. Tony glances over at Susan and gives Charlie 
an "Oh, well." look. Then he looks at Harriet and nods in 
approval of her.

EXT. FISHERMAN'S WHARF - NIGHT

The four of them walk along the wharf. Charlie is at one of 
those arcade games where you throw bean bags at the puppets 
and try and knock them down. Charlie knocks two down.

          ARCADE MAN
     One more and you get your pick.

          CHARLIE
          (to Harriet)
     You do it.

          HARRIET
     No, Charlie. I'm the worst.

          TONY
     Come on, you'll be great...

The arcade man turns around to watch. Harriet winds up and 
throws the bean bag directly into his neck.

          ARCADE MAN
     Hey!

          HARRIET
     Sorry... I told you Charlie.

          CHARLIE
     No, no, you're okay, you're just 
     having control problems.

They both start laughing. He puts his arm around her. In the 
b.g. the wounded arcade man is being led away by a co-worker.

They continued down the boardwalk stand in front of a House 
of Horrors.

It looks somewhat run down and Harriet looks questioningly 
at Charlie.

          CHARLIE
     I know this is really, really cheesy, 
     but in a way this is one of the places 
     in San Francisco I'm most proud of.

          HARRIET
     Yeah, let's go in.

Tony nods agreement. Susan looks bored. They go inside the

HOUSE OF HORRORS

it's as low rent as Charlie described. The "KEEPER OF THE 
THRESHOLD" so described in a poorly written sign, is an 
overweight man in his late twenties, wearing jeans and a 
denim jacket and a little bit of scary makeup. He looks like 
a roadie for the band, KISS. He stands at a podium, smoking 
and reading a paper. As Charlie, Tony, Harriet and Susan 
pass the Threshold Keeper, he takes a casual drag of his 
cigarette, lets out a little smoke and with zero commitment 
utters:

          THRESHOLD KEEPER
     Boo.

INT. WAX MUSEUM - DAY

Harriet and Charlie enter Bill's Wax Museum. The OWNER of 
the wax museum greets them.

          OWNER
     Hi. I'm Bill, welcome to my wax 
     museum.

They walk over to the exhibits. There are exhibits of Abraham 
Lincoln, Michael Jackson and Dolly Parton. As they look more 
closely they notice that the faces are exactly the same as 
Bill's. They laugh.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Pouring rain. THUNDER. Charlie and Harriet, wrapped in each 
others arms, walking through the rain.

          HARRIET
     I feel so safe with you right now. 
     You're never going to leave me, are 
     you? I feel like I could be here 
     forever.

                                   CUT TO:

TIGHT SHOT OF RAIN HITTING CHARLIE'S PANIC-STRICKEN FACE

                                   MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

THE REFLECTION OF RAIN ON CHARLIE'S PANIC-STRICKEN FACE

PULL BACK to see Charlie in bed. He lies awake on his side, 
his back up to Harriet's. She is sound asleep. Suddenly:

          HARRIET
          (sleeptalking)
     Ralph! No, Ralph!

Charlie sighs, then just shrugs and tries to fall asleep. 
What can he do.

FADE IN:

INT. CHARLIE'S PARENTS' APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Charlie and Harriet wait outside his parents' door.

          CHARLIE
     Well, this is it.

          HARRIET
     It'll be fine.

They enter the door.

INT. CHARLIE'S PARENT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

We again move along the hallway. We pass the Scottish wall, 
of fame, Scottie from "Star Trek", Sir Walter Scott, Sir 
Harry Lauder, Sheena Easton, Al Pacino, Billy Connolly, then 
the CAMERA BACKTRACKS to Pacino, where it HOLDS MOMENTARILY.

          CHARLIE
     Mom, Dad, we're here.

May comes up, wearing a fancy country and western outfit.

          MAY
     Ah, Charlie is this the wee Harriet. 
     Ah, she's beautiful.

          HARRIET
     Thank you.

          MAY
     She's so sweet. I hope you keep her.
          (calling)
     Stuart, come out here. You tube.

When he comes up, Stuart is wearing only a shirt with his 
boxer shorts.

          STUART
     Ah, it's the wee Harriet.

          MAY
     Stuart, put your pants on.

          STUART
     Hold your horses.
          (calling to William)
     Heed! Pants!

William comes around the corner with his pants.

          CHARLIE
     Dad, what's Al Pacino doing on the 
     Scottish wall of fame?

          STUART
     Oh, that's for Tony. So, Charlie 
     tells me you're a butcher. Let's 
     talk meat.

          CHARLIE
     Dad, no one wants to talk shop. 
     Especially butcher shop.

          STUART
     Come here.

Stuart gets him in a half-Nelson.

          CHARLIE
     Ah! Dad, dad I have a back zit, man 
     it kills.

Charlie struggles to free himself. Stuart turns to greet 
Harriet. As he reaches out his hand.

Totally instinctively, Harriet grabs Stuart's hand and twists 
it behind his back. Charlie is startled, as his date has 
just gotten Stuart into a Half-Nelson.

          HARRIET
          (releasing his hand)
     I'm sorry. I just... You just 
     surprised me. I'm sorry.

          STUART
     I like this one Charlie. She's quite 
     a filly.

          HARRIET
     I'm really embarrassed.

          STUART
     Don't be embarrassed about having a 
     good strong butcher's grip. Do you 
     link your own sausage?

          MAY
     Oh, ignore him. Come have a look at 
     some photos of Charlie when he was a 
     wee'n.

          CHARLIE
     Oh Mom, don't start with the pictures.

          MAY
     Ah, Charlie, lighten up. You've got 
     a pickle up your ass.

          CHARLIE
          (whispering to Harriet)
     I'm gonna use the bathroom. You be 
     okay alone with them?

          HARRIET
          (kissing)
     Fine. Don't worry about it. Hurry.

They smile as he leaves the room.

          STUART
     Make sure there's paper, Charlie.

Charlie picks up the pace, scared of what he might hear next.

          MAY
     Make sure you leave the seat down.

          CHARLIE
          (shutting her up)
     Ma, just show her the pictures.

          STUART
     And light a match.

          MAY
          (to Harriet)
     He always leaves the seat up. He's 
     gotta learn.

INT. BATHROOM AT PARENTS' - NIGHT

He closes the door, and shakes his head. What can he do? 
Those are his parents. On the wall opposite the toilet is a 
well-used dart board with pictures of the Queen Mother and 
Colonel Sanders. Hooked to the magazine caddie is a small 
container of darts.

INT. THE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

May excitedly shows Harriet family photo albums.

          MAY
     This is Charlie with his Uncle Ecky. 
     He's a policeman in Canada. And our 
     cousins Ruth and Jack. He's just got 
     a restraining order from his wife. 
     She's a lovely girl. This is Billy. 
     He's a member of parliament. He 
     drinks.

          HARRIET
     What a nice family you have.

CHARLIE IN THE BATHROOM

He doesn't seem in any hurry to leave either. He listens 
through the door to Harriet enthusiastically looking through 
old photos.

Charlie glances down at a stack of National Enquirers on the 
magazine rack. He flips through a few.

He sees one of the absurd headlines: "ALIEN UFO SEX DIET" 
Charlie shakes his head.

          HARRIET (O.S.)
          (through door)
     Charlie was the cutest baby.

          STUART (O.S.)
          (through door)
     You okay in there, Charlie? You didn't 
     fall in, did you?

          CHARLIE
          (through door)
     Jesus...

Charlie then looks down at another article in the Enquirer 
and reads:

"WHO'S NEXT FOR MRS. X - THE HONEYMOON KILLER?"

It is the article about Mrs. X -- the axe-murderer who kills 
her husbands on their honeymoons and then marries again under 
a different identity.

IN THE LIVING ROOM

May is quickly flipping through a photo album, pointing out 
pictures of relatives as she goes:

          HARRIET
     I can't believe the resemblance 
     between you and Charlie, Mrs. 
     MacKenzie.

INT. CHARLIE IN THE BATHROOM

With Harriet speaking in the b.g., Charlie continues reading, 
now absorbed in the article about the 3 victims:

          HARRIET (O.S.)
          (through door)
     You have the same smile. It's so 
     incredible.

"VICTIM #1 - THE GERMAN MARTIAL ARTS EXPERT FROM MIAMI"

"VICTIM #2 - THE LOUNGE SINGER FROM ATLANTIC CITY"

"VICTIM #3 - THE SAN FRANCISCO PLUMBER - RALPH ELLIOT"

INT. CHARLIE'S CAR - NIGHT - C.U. - HARRIET'S FACE

Sitting in the front seat of Charlie's car, smiling, content, 
a great meal, a great night out with Charlie and a nice 
evening with his parents.

Slowly PAN across the front seat to Charlie. A nervous anxious 
"what the hell am I getting myself into" look on his face.

          CHARLIE
     So, that was some move you put on my 
     Dad, there. Did you study Karate, 
     or...?

          HARRIET
     No. Not officially. I dated a guy 
     for a while who ran a studio.

          CHARLIE
     Oh, the martial arts expert. The 
     north-south guy. Here in San 
     Francisco?

          HARRIET
     Actually, Miami.

He looks straight ahead, trying to act unfazed. But, he's 
very phased -- his expression is covered in it.

          CHARLIE
     Was that before Atlantic City, or 
     after?

          HARRIET
     Oh, that was years ago. Atlantic 
     City was recent. I didn't care for 
     Atlantic City. A town full of gamblers 
     and lounge singers.

He keeps driving.

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Charlie walks through the precinct towards Tony's office, 
holding the National Enquirer in his hand.

          DESK SERGEANT
     Hey Charlie!

          CHARLIE
     Is Tony back there?

The Sergeant nods and Charlie heads back to the office.

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

          CAPTAIN
     O.K., Tony. Do you have the K673 
     form completed yet, that street vendor 
     incident on Powell Street?

          TONY
          (really bummed)
     Yes, Captain.

          CAPTAIN
     Tony, do you mind my saying that you 
     seem a little down?

          TONY
     Captain. It's about my work. About 
     being a policeman.

          CAPTAIN
     Tony, if there's anything wrong, I'm 
     here to listen.

          TONY
     I know. And that's what's irritating, 
     you're too nice.

          CAPTAIN
     Too nice!?

          TONY
     Yes, You're my captain for gods sakes. 
     You should be constantly on my case, 
     like the captain on Starsky and Hutch. 
     Once a week you should routinely 
     haul my ass into your office, accuse 
     me of being a maverick and complain 
     to me that you're sick and tired of 
     defending my screwball antics to the 
     commissioner.

          CAPTAIN
     Well, as you may know, Tony. I don't 
     report to a commissioner. I report 
     to a committee, some of whom are 
     appointed, some elected and the 
     remainder co-opted on a bi-annual 
     basis. A quorum --

          TONY
     Police work should be all about 
     running around, following up crazy 
     hunches that turn out to be right, 
     going out on a limb.

          CAPTAIN
     Well Tony, I've never seen it that 
     way. For me police work is all about 
     following procedure and remaining 
     accountable to the general public.

          TONY
          (exasperated)
     Captain! When I joined the police 
     force, I thought I was going to be 
     Serpico and unfortunately I ended up 
     being Toma. I would have settled for 
     Beretta.

          CAPTAIN
     That's interesting Tony. I'm perturbed 
     that you should be so disillusioned.

Charlie enters.

          CHARLIE
     Hey, Tony, I gotta talk to you.

          CAPTAIN
     Oh, hello, Charlie. Look, I'm in the 
     way here. You guys probably have 
     something you want to talk about, 
     and Tony, if you've still got stuff 
     you want to sort out, please, you 
     know where the suggestion box is.

The Captain exits.

          CHARLIE
     Nice guy. Hey, what's up?

          TONY
     I'm having doubts about being a cop 
     again. It's not like how it is on 
     cop shows. All I do is fill out papers 
     and reports.

          CHARLIE
     Let me get this straight, your Captain 
     hasn't threatened to have you up on 
     charges so fast you won't know what 
     hit you?

          TONY
     No! He's never once said to me that 
     he was going to "throw the book at 
     me so hard it'll knock my ass from 
     here till Tuesday." Anyways what's 
     up?

Charlie pulls out the National Enquirer (the one on MRS. X, 
the Honeymoon Killer).

          CHARLIE
     Have you heard of this case? Mrs. X? 
     She murders her husbands on their 
     honeymoons and then changes her 
     identity and marries again.

          TONY
     I never heard of it. So what?

          CHARLIE
     Curious, that's all. I read about 
     it, and...
          (after a pause)
     I think I'm dating Mrs. X.

          TONY
          (after a pause)
     Two words, Charlie. Get therapy. 
     They have doctors that deal 
     specifically with this illness.

          CHARLIE
     Everything's adding up, Tony. One of 
     the victims was a martial arts expert. 
     Last night at dinner, she put a 
     martial arts move on my dad.

          TONY
     There about twenty thousand people 
     in San Francisco who are martial 
     arts experts. Should I arrest all of 
     them too?

          CHARLIE
     If they also say Ralph in their sleep 
     I think it'd be a good start.
          (showing him paper)
     Ralph Elliot. A plumber from San 
     Francisco. Missing since his 
     honeymoon.

          TONY
     You're just getting scared. Like the 
     dream, you feel Harriet could be the 
     one, so you start to suspect her of 
     things, 'cause deep down you're scared 
     that if she is the one, you'll marry, 
     and marriage to you is death.

          CHARLIE
     Hey, don't analyze my dreams, okay? 
     They're my dreams. Analyze your own 
     dreams.
          (a beat)
     It's not a marrying thing, Tony. 
     It's a murdering thing.
          (showing him paper)
     Harriet lived in Atlantic City, right? 
     Well so did this guy, right around 
     the same time she left town.

          TONY
          (reading article)
     "Larry Leonard, a crooner who made a 
     name for himself for being able to 
     sing in six different languages the 
     song "Only You".
          (putting paper down)
     Does she know the song "Only You?"

          CHARLIE
     I don't know. It hasn't come up yet.

          TONY
     Charlie, move past it. You're running 
     your life by the National Enquirer.

          CHARLIE
          (defensively)
     What? It's the fifth highest 
     circulating newspaper in the United 
     States.
          (taking paper back)
     Mrs. X. Please. Look it up.

COMPUTER ROOM AT POLICE STATION - MINUTES LATER

Charlie and Tony are in the back with KATHY, a stocky black 
woman in uniform, who works in the files department.

          KATHY
     There's no record of any deaths. All 
     three of these guys were reported 
     missing around the time of their 
     honeymoon, but so were the wives. No 
     pictures of any of the brides. For 
     all we know they just picked up and 
     moved away.

          CHARLIE
     And Ralph Elliot, too?

          TONY
     Charlie, you're talking about three 
     guys over a seven year span. That's 
     hardly news. No deaths. Elopement in 
     this state, as of this day, is still 
     not illegal.

          CHARLIE
          (re: the article)
     Yeah well murder is. And this article 
     says that these men were murdered by 
     the same woman.

          KATHY
     Mr. MacKenzie, we've found that, 
     most National Enquirer articles are 
     actually based on our own police 
     reports. They take the facts and 
     fabricate a story around them.

          TONY
     It's true, Charlie. You gotta realize 
     that. I mean, personally, I would 
     lie to you, but Kathy... has this 
     crazy notion of always telling the 
     truth.
          (patting his back)
     You feel better now?

          CHARLIE
     It guess so. It's just... if I had a 
     photo of Harriet, I could show it to 
     the relatives or friends of Mrs. X's 
     victims to identify her.

          TONY
     Charlie, listen to me! There is no 
     Mrs. X! Drop it! Okay?

INT. HALLWAY - HARRIET'S APARTMENT - EVENING

Charlie knocks on the door. Rose answers.

          ROSE
          (thrilled)
     You're back. But Harriet's not here 
     yet.

          CHARLIE
     Maybe I could wait.

          ROSE
     Sure. That would be fine.

She then starts to slowly close the door. He props it open 
with his hand.

          CHARLIE
     Inside? I was hoping...

          ROSE
          (letting him in)
     I'm glad you asked. I didn't want to 
     be so forward. I mean, if you're 
     waiting inside, then you feel 
     obligated to entertain me and keep 
     up the conversation just to be polite, 
     and really your head might be totally 
     elsewhere and then there's the chance 
     that you would really want to talk 
     and it's me who'd be busy, but in an 
     attempt not to be rude, I sit there 
     and listen to some story that you 
     don't really want to tell and I don't 
     really have time to hear. You know?

          CHARLIE
     I couldn't agree with you more.

          ROSE
     I think about a lot of things.

          CHARLIE
     Look, if you have work to do, you go 
     right ahead.
          ("ah, here's an angle")
     I mean, to tell you the truth, I'd 
     love to see your work.

          ROSE
     Okay! What would you like me to do?

          CHARLIE
     No, I don't want to see you work. I 
     was talking about your work. Your 
     photographs. That one that I saw was 
     so, wonderful, and...

          ROSE
     Harriet's far more talented than I 
     am.

          CHARLIE
     Well, I'm sure it's so subjective 
     anyway and...
          (out of patience)
     Rose, show me your photos.

CLOSE ON PHOTOGRAPHS

There are two kinds. Beautiful travel pictures and very erotic 
black and white portraits of young men and women. All with a 
slight sadomasochistic quality. At the bottom of every photo 
is says: "Seasons Greetings".

          CHARLIE
     Hey, these are some interesting photos 
     here. Very impressive. Nice shots of 
     Sauselito and... some good bondage 
     shots. A lot of people wouldn't think 
     to mix the two subjects, but they're 
     really a natural together.
          (new thought)
     Hey, you wouldn't happen to have any 
     pictures of Harriet by chance, would 
     you?

          ROSE
          (re: her cards)
     Well, I don't think she'd wanna do 
     this sort of...

          CHARLIE
     No, no, not that. Just, in general 
     some photos. Any little snapshot 
     would do.

          ROSE
     I doubt I'd have any. Harriet hates 
     being photographed.

The sound of a key in the door as Harriet enters the 
apartment.

          HARRIET (O.S.)
     Rose -- did I see Charlie's car out 
     in front?

          ROSE
     We're in here, Harriet.

          HARRIET
          (walking in)
     What are you guys doing?

          CHARLIE
          (covering up)
     Oh, nothing. Just looking through 
     some of Rose's work.

          ROSE
     ...Charlie wanted a photo of you.

          CHARLIE
     And that. That too.

          HARRIET
     Why of me, Charlie?

          CHARLIE
     Well, sentimental reasons. Something 
     to remind me of you when we're not 
     together.

She takes him in her arms and gives him a knee buckling kiss.

          HARRIET
     There, can you remember that?

          CHARLIE
     Okay, it's just, I was gonna give 
     one to my parents, too, and...
          (getting nowhere)
     Another time would be fine. It's 
     hardly a matter of life and death.

TV SET - PLAYING THE EVENING NEWS

          (ON TV)
     In the news tonight, regarding a 
     Beverly Hills Jeweler, Morris Cohan, 
     who died last week, police are now 
     suspecting that Morris's partner, 
     Lawrence Sachs, may have murdered 
     him with an untraceable poison.

Reveal: we are in...

INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Charlie is on a Stair Master, as Harriet walks in wearing a 
robe. The TV is on in the b.g.

          CHARLIE
     Where you been?

          HARRIET
     Downstairs. I have a surprise for 
     you.

          CHARLIE
     Great. I just wanna do a quick twenty 
     minutes on the Stair Master before 
     bed.

Harriet drops her robe, and from over her shoulder we see 
that Charlie prefers what he sees to working out.

          CHARLIE
     I'll do forty tomorrow.

          HARRIET
          (getting into bed)
     I got something much healthier for 
     you than that.

She pulls out a milkshake from behind her back.

          CHARLIE
     What is it?

          HARRIET
     It's a health shake. Eggs, malt, 
     cinnamon, oranges. It's great. I 
     mixed it up downstairs.

THE TV SET

continues on about poisons and poisoners. Charlie glances at 
it.

          NEWS ANCHORMAN
          (ON TV)
     Poisoning has become the second 
     leading method of murder in recent 
     years, due to...

Charlie watches the TV, looking a bit disturbed. Harriet 
offers him the shake.

          CHARLIE
     Oh, look, I'm full. Dinner and... 
     No...

          HARRIET
     You'll like it Charlie.

          CHARLIE
     No, really, thanks.

          HARRIET
          (putting it up to his 
          lips)
     You won't try it. I spent twenty 
     minutes making it.

He takes it. Lifts it to his mouth... then puts it on the 
table.

          CHARLIE
          (sniffing it)
     Ummm. Smells good. Maybe I'll take 
     some to the office tomorrow.
          (running into bathroom)
     I'm gonna brush my teeth. Be right 
     back.

Charlie goes into the bathroom.

CHARLIE'S BATHROOM

Harriet comes into the bathroom and lays the empty glass 
down on the counter.

          HARRIET
     I'm gonna take a quick shower.

Charlie notices the empty glass on the counter.

          CHARLIE
     Harriet, where did the shake go?

          HARRIET
     What do you care? I drank it.
          (getting into shower)
     You could have at least tried it. 
     You make me feel bad sometimes, 
     Charlie. I don't know why.

With her in the shower, he sneaks back into the bedroom and 
checks the trash can. Nothing. Then he runs around the bed 
to the other trash can. Nothing.

He looks thoroughly confused as she enter the bedroom, wearing 
a towel. She takes the towel off as she slips underneath the 
covers. He gets into bed next to her. She gives him a kiss.

          HARRIET
     Sorry. I'm a little sensitive. You 
     didn't want to drink my milkshake. 
     So what -- right?

          NEWS ANCHORMAN
          (ON TV)
     Regarding the murder between the two 
     partners, we talked to Toxicologist 
     Dr. Show on the issue.

Charlie and Harriet are watching the news show. DOCTOR SHOW 
is patched in via the Anchorman's close circuit TV.

          NEWS ANCHORMAN
          (ON TV)
     Doctor, is it possible that one could 
     be poisoned with no trace at all?

          DOCTOR SHOW
          (ON TV)
     Certainly. There are plants that 
     grow very commonly in our own backyard 
     that could easily be fermented into 
     poison. Take for instance the...

          CHARLIE
          (getting nervous; 
          blocking out TV)
     Harriet, why don't we shut the light 
     off.

          NEWS ANCHORMAN
          (ON TV)
     Really? And how easy it that to do?

          DOCTOR
          (ON TV)
     Scarily enough, quite simple. You 
     merely take the...

          CHARLIE
          (blocking out the TV 
          again)
     Maybe we should turn the light back 
     on. Yeah that's better.

          HARRIET
     Charlie, what's the matter?

          CHARLIE
     Nothing.

          HARRIET
     Charlie...

          CHARLIE
     Well, it's just...
          (re: the TV)
     The TV. You can't even watch the 
     news these days without getting 
     depressed.

          HARRIET
     I know, Charlie. And it's not just 
     that. Look at the things people are 
     doing. Partners killing each other... 
     I mean, you hear a story like that, 
     and... who can you really trust these 
     days?

          CHARLIE
     What do you mean?

          HARRIET
     It's like, have you ever stood with 
     someone at the edge of a cliff, or 
     the edge of a subway platform, and 
     you think, just for a split second, 
     "What if I pushed him?"

          CHARLIE
     Well, I don't really take the subway 
     ever, so...

Charlie turns over on his side, she cuddles up behind him.

          HARRIET
     I'm just making a point of how many 
     times we trust people with our lives. 
     I mean, look at us. If you didn't 
     trust me, you would never be able to 
     fall asleep.

          CHARLIE
     Why do you say that?

          HARRIET
     Look at you, you're sleeping. Look 
     how vulnerable you are. I mean, I 
     could do anything at that point.

          CHARLIE
          (nervous)
     What could you do?

          HARRIET
          (sweet and innocent)
     Anything. You're lying on your side, 
     asleep, I could... stick a needle in 
     your ear.

          CHARLIE
          (grabbing his ear at 
          the thought)
     Aahhh!

          HARRIET
     I'm just making a point of what a 
     good relationship we have. Goodnight, 
     sweetheart.

He looks very uneasy. She kisses him and shuts off the light. 
The moon gives the room an eerie glow.

          HARRIET
     Well, good night.

          CHARLIE
     Good night.

She doesn't close her eyes. He's scared to close his. Pause.

          CHARLIE
     Well... good night.

          HARRIET
          (smiling)
     Good night.

They both look over at each other. She closes her eyes. He 
takes a deep breath and then closes his eyes.

And covers his ear with his hand.

INT. BART PLATFORM - DAY

Charlie is on the crowded platform. Next to him is an old 
lady with a lot of shopping bags. Three kids on skateboards 
whiz by and accidentally knock bags out of her hands. Cat 
toys and cans of cat food go everywhere. Charlie bends down 
and starts to help her gather her stuff.

          LADY
     Thank you very much, young man. I've 
     gotta get all this stuff back to my 
     children.

          CHARLIE
     Your children?

          LADY
     When I say my children I mean my 
     cats. You see my children moved out 
     years ago, so all I've got is my 
     cats. I have over one hundred of 
     them.

          CHARLIE
     That's a lot of cats.

          HARRIET (O.S.)
     Charlie.

Charlie looks up and sees Harriet waving to him from the 
subway stairs. He waves back and motions. "I'll be there in 
a second", and continues to help the old lady. She watches 
from the stairs.

          LADY
     You see this red toy? That's for the 
     Captain, he's finicky. and this blue 
     one? That's for Marco Polo.

Two train headlights are seen off in the distance.

          CHARLIE
     Do you have a name for all of your 
     cats?

          LADY
     Oh, yes.

Charlie glances over at Harriet, who slowly makes her way 
down the platform towards him.

          LADY
     Let me see! There's Winston Churchill, 
     Reda Sovine, Thomas Edison, Andrew 
     Carnegie...

The train is getting closer and closer, and so is Harriet.

          CHARLIE
     ...He was Scottish.

Harriet moves forward a step, Charlie moves back a step.

          LADY
     Wasn't he Irish?

As Harriet seems to get closer Charlie continues to back up, 
picking up cat toys. Charlie realizes he has no where else 
to turn. so he side steps down the platform, never stopping 
his conversation with the lady.

          CHARLIE
     Actually he was Scottish. Trust me, 
     I know these things.

Harriet is moving in on him. Charlie steadily makes his way 
down the platform, feigning accidentally kicking cat food 
down the platform. The old lady is unsure what is going on, 
she tries to keep up with him.

          LADY
     Now that you say it, he was Scotch.

Charlie runs out of platform. Harriet is very close to him. 
The train is closer, so is Harriet. Charlie lets out a scream.

          CHARLIE
     Noooooo!

Charlie is standing at the edge of the platform, Harriet is 
a good six or seven feet away as the train passes by. Charlie 
is safe. People are all staring at Charlie curiously, 
including Harriet and the old lady. Charlie is embarrassed.

          CHARLIE
          (embarrassed)
     Nooooooo, Scotch is a drink. Scots 
     are a people. Sorry, that just always 
     bugged me.

No one knows what is going on.

          LADY
     I'm sorry, I didn't know it meant so 
     much to you.

          CHARLIE
     Hi, Harriet.

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE BUILDING - DAY

INT. CHRONICLE ANNOUNCEMENTS DESK.

WE SEE A LONG DESK WITH DIFFERENT SIGNS THAT READ; BIRTHS, 
DEATHS, AND MARRIAGES.

We find Charlie at the marriage counter.

          ASSISTANT
     Yes, Sir, can I help you?

          CHARLIE
     I'd like to put in an announcement 
     of my parents forty-fifth wedding 
     anniversary.

          ASSISTANT
     Sure, it's $4.50 per word, and you've 
     got a choice of standard or bold.

          CHARLIE
     Bold, and here, I've written it out.

Charlie looks over to the deaths counter. He overhears two 
obituary assistants having a conversation.

          OBITUARY ASSISTANT #1
     Hi, Frank, busy week?

          OBITUARY ASSISTANT #2
     I've only got two. It's dead around 
     here.

Both assistants laugh. Charlie is mildly bemused.

          OBITUARY ASSISTANT #2
     Well, I've got this one guy, a 
     tourist. He had a heart attack on a 
     cable car.

          OBITUARY ASSISTANT #1
     Looks like he left his heart in San 
     Francisco.

          MARRIAGE ASSISTANT
     Hey, that's a real person you're 
     talking about.

          OBITUARY ASSISTANT #1
     You're right, I'm sorry.

          OBITUARY ASSISTANT #2
     Well, there's this other guy Elliot, 
     Ralph. Plumber, disappeared four 
     months ago. Body found in a sewer.
          (pause)

          OBITUARY ASSISTANT #1
          (despite himself)
     I guess he took his work too 
     seriously, and his life went down 
     the drain.

          CHARLIE
     Did they mention anything about his 
     wife?

          OBITUARY ASSISTANT #1
          (crest fallen)
     You're right, I feel bad. Point taken. 
     I'm mean, these are real people we're 
     talking about.

          CHARLIE
     No, I'm serious. Did he mention the 
     wife?

          OBITUARY ASSISTANT #1
     You made your point. I was wrong to 
     make a joke about a person's life.

          CHARLIE
     I really want to know about his wife.

          OBITUARY ASSISTANT #1
          (crying and shouting)
     O.K., you win. I'm a bad, bad person.

          OBITUARY ASSISTANT #2
     Frank take it easy.

          OBITUARY ASSISTANT #1
     No, he's right!
          (pounding his head 
          with his fists)
     I'm for shit, I'm one insensitive 
     asshole.

          CHARLIE
     Is there any mention of the wife? At 
     all?

          OBITUARY ASSISTANT #1
     NO! THERE'S NO MENTION OF THE WIFE! 
     YOU HAPPY!?

Charlie exits.

EXT. CHRONICLE ANNOUNCEMENT OFFICE - DAY

Charlie stands outside the announcement office, terrified.

INT. MEATS OF THE WORLD

Harriet is talking to a CUSTOMER.

          HARRIET
     Hi.

          CHARLIE
     I'm sorry.
          (beat)
     I think you're a terrific woman.
          (beat)
     I just don't think we should see 
     each other anymore.

She moves around to Charlie. She lifts his chin so that he 
is looking directly into her eyes.

          HARRIET
     Why not? And tell me the truth.

          CHARLIE
     The truth. Okay. The truth is...

She is so close to him, and so very beautiful, it's 
distracting.

          CHARLIE
     The truth is... I'm afraid that you 
     are...
          (he can't)
     You're going to laugh.

          HARRIET
     I don't think so.

          CHARLIE
     Okay... the truth is that I'm afraid 
     you're going to ki... leave me.

          HARRIET
     I'm going to "cleave you?" What does 
     that mean?

          CHARLIE
     Leave me. Not "cleave me." Reject 
     me. And so I decided to take matters 
     into my own hands and get it over 
     with by...

          HARRIET
     Rejecting me.

          CHARLIE
          (he feels awful)
     Purely preventive... It's not anything 
     you've done.

          HARRIET
     I know that... So why are you leaving 
     me?

          CHARLIE
          (heartbroken)
     Harriet, maybe I'm not meant to be 
     in a relationship.

A single tear runs down her cheek. She brushes it away 
quickly.

          CHARLIE
     I never wanted to hurt you.

          HARRIET
     You haven't. At least you left early 
     on.
          (she's crying)
     So, that's it, then. I've got a lot 
     of work to do.
          (to Customer)
     Now, where were we?

Charlie goes.

INT. SPILETTI'S COFFEE HOUSE - NIGHT

Charlie lies on the bar head down. Tony rushes in, looks 
around and sees Charlie.

          CHARLIE
          (without lifting head)
     Two hours and four minutes. Tony, I 
     need you, and two hours and four 
     minutes later you show up.

          TONY
     Sorry. I know it was irresponsible 
     to stay at the drug bust until it 
     was over, but... What happened?

          CHARLIE
          (slowly sitting up)
     I'm gonna tell you, but when I do, 
     just say nothing. Don't judge me. 
     Just be my friend. Okay?

          TONY
     Fine. Okay.

          CHARLIE
     I broke up with Harriet.

          TONY
     You're an asshole.

          CHARLIE
     What's your point?

          TONY
     I'm sorry, I just... why?

          CHARLIE
     Tony, she's a killer. The... 
     everything.

          TONY
     But nothing's proven. The only thing 
     you're actually sure she did so far 
     is she's treated you like a King.

          CHARLIE
     I dunno, Tony, I just...

          TONY
     Besides, everyone has something going 
     on with them. I mean, you can't find 
     everything in one person. I mean, 
     she's bright, she's funny, she's 
     independent. So maybe, and it's really 
     just a maybe, she kills her husbands. 
     Marriage is give and take, Man. You 
     take the good with the bad.

INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

Charlie lies in bed. He's writing in his journal. He stares 
out into space. Inspired, he writes...

ANGLE ON THE JOURNAL

DON'T BE DISILLUSIONED BY THE SCOTTISH SON AS HE FLIES, IN 
BAT-LIKE UNISON

CHARLIE

pauses a moment to reflect, then writes...

ANGLE ON THE JOURNAL

UNTRUST-ING 
UNKNOW-ING 
UNLOV-ING

CHARLIE

Thinks of something else and writes...

ANGLE ON THE JOURNAL

THIS POEM SUCKS

His hand reaches across and scratches it out.

EXT. HAIGHT-ASHBURY STREET - DAY

Charlie is exiting a vintage record store. Suddenly he finds 
himself face to face with Sherri. She's accompanied by a 
handsome young man.

          SHERRI
     Hey, Charlie.

          CHARLIE
     Hi. How're you doing.
          (he glances at her 
          friend)
     Good, huh?

          SHERRI
     I'm okay. This is Michael. Michael, 
     this is Charlie MacKenzie.

          YOUNG GUY
     I know. Why don't you two talk. I'm 
     going over there to buy some 
     magazines.

He walks over to a magazine stand.

          CHARLIE
     That good looking and he can read!

          SHERRI
     I'm teaching him. I heard you have a 
     new girlfriend.

          CHARLIE
     We broke up. There were problems.

          SHERRI
     Problems?

          CHARLIE
     Difficulties.

          SHERRI
     Let me guess...
          (smiles)
     She's a murderer.

For a moment, Charlie is too stunned to respond. Then...

          CHARLIE
     Why did you just say that?

          SHERRI
          (laughs)
     What else is left?

INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - EARLY EVENING

He's on the Stair Master, stepping very lethargically. The 
TELEPHONE RINGS: He goes to answer.

          CHARLIE
     Hello...

          TONY
          (through phone)
     Not that it matters anymore, but I 
     thought you should know -- someone 
     just turned themselves in for the 
     murder of Ralph Elliot.

          CHARLIE
     Really? Did she confess to the other 
     murders?

          TONY
     Just the plumber so far, but she'll 
     come along.
          (after a pause)
     A little old lady from Pacific 
     Heights. Said he overcharged her on 
     a leaking sink.

          CHARLIE
     Really. Leaky sink, huh?

          TONY
     Anyway, crime to stop. Gotta go. 
     I'll catch you later.

Tony hangs up. Charlie stops pedaling on the bike. Now he 
really feels like shit. Harriet's not a killer. Sherri's not 
a cheater.

He races out of the bedroom.

Moments later he appears, puts on a pair of pants over his 
exercise shorts, then races out the door again.

EXT./INT. CHARLIE'S CAR - EARLY EVENING

Charlie races along towards Harriet's house.

EXT. HARRIET'S APARTMENT DOOR - DAY

He races up to the door and starts to bang and knock and 
ring...

          CHARLIE
          (through door)
     Harriet, it's me, Charlie.

          HARRIET (O.S.)
     Go away, Charlie.

          CHARLIE
     I've gotta talk to you, cause I miss 
     you, and I made a mistake... and if 
     you give me another chance I'll 
     change. I will. I promise. I'll get 
     help, or therapy, or... Yeah, that'll 
     be great. Therapy. Even twice a week. 
     I'll check with my insurance to see 
     if I'm covered, but forget that. 
     Harriet...

The chain opens on the door.

          HARRIET
     You really hurt me.

          CHARLIE
     I'll make it up to you, can we at 
     least talk.

          HARRIET
     Sure, talk.

Rose steps up behind Charlie.

          ROSE (O.S.)
     Hi, Charlie.

          CHARLIE
     AAAhhhhhh.

          ROSE
          (as she now proceeds 
          to be let in by 
          Harriet)
     Trust your first instincts, Charlie. 
     You never do. It's your big mistake. 
     That and the haircut.

Once again, baffled by Rose, Charlie touches his hair, shakes 
it off and looks Harriet right in the eye.

          CHARLIE
     I don't want to lose you.

          HARRIET
     You didn't lose me. You rejected me.

          CHARLIE
     I'm unrejecting you.

          HARRIET
     How do I know you won't reject me 
     again?

          CHARLIE
     I love you.

          HARRIET
          (after a long pause)
     I love you. But you blew it, Charlie, 
     you blew it.

She goes into the house. Charlie stands there dejected. He 
knows he's blown it.

INT. HARRIET'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Harriet is doing a load of laundry consisting of bloodied 
work clothes. Suddenly she can hear the sound of MUSIC, very 
loudly.

Annoyed, she goes out her front door to tell her neighbors 
off. Just as she's about to knock on the door, she realizes 
it's not the source of the music. At that moment her neighbor, 
who is a STEWARDESS, comes out in nightclothes.

          STEWARDESS
     I don't mean to be a pain, but I'm a 
     stewardess, and I have an early flight 
     out in the morning. Can you please 
     keep your music down?

          HARRIET
     I thought it was coming from here.

          STEWARDESS
     But someone keeps shouting your name 
     over and over.

Puzzled, Harriet rushes back to her own balcony.

EXT. HARRIET'S APARTMENT - BALCONY - NIGHT

Harriet rushes out and smiles as she sees the source of the 
noise. Charlie serenades Harriet in the street below, 
accompanied by a TRUMPETER with a MUTE, a DOUBLE BASS PLAYER 
AND A GUY ON A SNARE.

          CHARLIE
     HARRIET, HARRIET HARD-HEARTED 
     HARBINGER OF HAGGIS 
     BEAUTIFUL, BEMUSED BELLICOSE BUTCHER
     UNTRUST-ING
     UNKNOW-ING
     UNLOV-ING
     HE WANTS YOU BACK HE SCREAMS INTO 
     THE NIGHT AIR LIKE A FIREMAN GOING 
     TO A WINDOW THAT HAS NO FIRE EXCEPT 
     THE PASSION OF HIS HEART 
     I AM LONELY,
     IT'S REALLY HARD
     THIS POEM SUCKS

A crowd has gathered in the street and spectators group on 
their balconies. They break out into APPLAUSE. Charlie proudly 
takes the applause and bows to Harriet. She throws him a 
flower. He's won her back.

INT. BATHTUB - HARRIET'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Romantic with candles surrounding the tub. Harriet and Charlie 
are bathing together. Wherever one of them moves, the water 
extinguishes a candle and Charlie lights it. This is keeping 
him pretty busy.

          HARRIET
     I've been there for almost a year. I 
     only planned on stay with her for a 
     few weeks, but she gets upset every 
     time I say I'm moving.

          CHARLIE
     You were close as kids?

          HARRIET
     I pretty much raised her. You know 
     the scene. Depressed mother... 
     withdrawn father.
          (she remembers)
     My dad was a photographer too.

          CHARLIE
     Really?

          HARRIET
     He hated it. Trudging off to those 
     weddings every Saturday night. Other 
     people's celebrations he called it. 
     He said sometimes they didn't even 
     offer him a glass of soda. He had a 
     small studio, and every year at 
     Christmas he'd take a picture of me 
     and Rose and put it in the window on 
     a little card that said "Seasons 
     Greetings." Awful pictures. It's 
     like... I could see his pain in my 
     face. Anyway, me and my sister worked 
     with our "childhood issues" in 
     different ways. She became a 
     photographer and I became phobic 
     about having my picture taken. It's 
     quite a family.

          CHARLIE
     Where are they now? Your parents?

          HARRIET
     Dead. Car accident.

There is a RING at the door.

          ROSE (O.S.)
     Harriet, its for you.

INT. HARRIET'S LIVING ROOM

Charlie comes out of the bathroom in a robe.

          HARRIET
     Charlie, I want you to meet a friend 
     of mine. Say hi to Ralph.

          CHARLIE
          (shocked)
     Ralph?

A plain looking lady in her thirties, RALPH, is sitting by 
the window.

          CHARLIE
          (delighted)
     Oh, like Ralph, the lady carpenter 
     in Green Acres!

          HARRIET
     This is Charlie.

          CHARLIE
     I love you!

          RALPH
     It's nice to meet you.

          CHARLIE
          (ecstatic)
     Nice? It's more than nice. It's great 
     to meet you. It's fantastic to meet 
     you. I just, I can't tell you how 
     glad I am. Ralph. Really. I am.

          RALPH
     Well, thank you, I've heard a lot of 
     nice things about you too, and...

He rushes over to hug her.

          CHARLIE
     Oh, Ralphie, I love you.

Swept up in his enthusiasm his towel falls off. Harriet is 
shocked, but amused.

          HARRIET
     I'll leave you guys alone. Have a 
     great time.

Charlie realizes he is naked. His arms are still wrapped 
around Ralph.

          CHARLIE
     I'm naked, aren't I?

          HARRIET
     Why, yes, you are.

          CHARLIE
     I should really get dressed now.

He hurriedly puts his towel back on, bolts to the bedroom 
door. Just before he enters, he pauses and turns to Ralph.

          CHARLIE
          (to Ralph)
     Call me.

He leaves.

          RALPH
          (to Harriet; a little 
          confused)
     Friendly guy.

                                   CUT TO:

A KITCHEN DOOR OPENS...

and Charlie's mother, MAY, shoulders her way through the 
door, carrying a HAPPY ANNIVERSARY CAKE with a big 45 written 
on it.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL WE ARE IN:

INT. CHARLIE'S PARENTS' APARTMENT - NIGHT

May and Stuart's 45 year anniversary party. UNCLE ANGUS is 
at the piano playing "Happy Anniversary" as Charlie's parents, 
all their friends and Harriet all sit around the piano 
SINGING:

          THE GROUP
     Happy Anniversary to you...
          (Etc.)

The song ends. May and Stuart blow out the candles.

          MAY
     Okay, everyone come and get a piece 
     of cake and some milk.

          CHARLIE
     Hey Dad, I got an anniversary present 
     for you...

Stuart looks up, and Charlie gets him in a headlock and pins 
him to the ground.

          STUART
     I'm proud of you, son. I'm proud of 
     you.
          (Stuart addresses the 
          group)
     I just wanna propose a toast. To my 
     wife. Forty five years ago today May 
     and I got married. Some of you were 
     there, some of you weren't born yet, 
     some of you are now dead, but... We 
     both said, "I do" and we haven't 
     agreed on a single thing since. But, 
     I'm glad I married you May cause... 
     It could have been worse and 
     besides... I still love you.

They kiss and everyone APPLAUDS. Uncle Angus breaks into, 
"Stand By Your Man." May and Stuart start to dance. Charlie 
looks at another young couple who are touched by this sincere 
display of love. He looks over at Harriet. Stuart and May 
feed each other cake. Charlie approaches Harriet.

          CHARLIE
     Harriet, I wanna talk to you.

          HARRIET
     Boy, you really made some impression 
     with Ralph. She can't get over you.

          CHARLIE
          (stalling; nervous)
     I'm just so happy for you to have 
     friends like Ralph. What a great 
     friend to have.

          HARRIET
     Is everything all right, Charlie? 
     You're perspiring.

          CHARLIE
     Harriet... marry me.

          HARRIET
     What?

          CHARLIE
     I want to have a wedding. With you.

          HARRIET
     No.

          CHARLIE
     Please.

          HARRIET
     I don't know, Charlie. It's so good 
     like it is. Why don't we just live 
     together first?

          CHARLIE
     Because, I love you and I want you 
     to marry me and be with me for 45 
     years. I want you to have my children, 
     and I want to have your children. I 
     know that sounds like a lot of 
     children, and they might not all get 
     along, but... I'm finally ready to 
     trust you and to make a commitment. 
     Marry me, Harriet, please. Be my 
     wife.

Harriet flinches slightly at the word "Wife", but Charlie is 
too wrapped up in the moment to notice. Stuart addresses the 
group.

          STUART
     I'd like to thank Charlie for throwing 
     us this party. I hope some day you 
     have the same great 45 years that 
     we've had.

People clap and smile. Harriet looks at Charlie. He has tears 
in his eyes.

          HARRIET
     Yes.

At first it doesn't register. Then...

          CHARLIE
     You will?

She smiles.

          HARRIET
     Let's get married, Charlie.

They kiss.

          MAY
          (from across room)
     Harriet, come here a minute. I want 
     you and Uncle Angus to play a song 
     together.

Harriet and Charlie kiss one last time and she goes to the 
piano.

Charlie stays in the corner, and Tony comes over.

          TONY
     Hey, sorry I'm so late. What's 
     happening?

          CHARLIE
     Nothing. Nothing at all. Just two 
     little things...
          (as Tony looks in)
     That woman over there in the corner... 
     She's Harriet's friend, and her name 
     is Ralph.

          TONY
     No shit.

          CHARLIE
     And secondly... That woman over 
     there...
          (Re: Harriet)
     That's Harriet, and we're getting 
     married.

          TONY
          (excited)
     Fantastic... What did I tell you. 
     She's a great girl. And the last 
     thing in the world she'd be is a 
     murderer.

And then Harriet begins singing at the piano.

          HARRIET
          (singing)
     ONLY YOU...
     CAN MAKE THIS WORLD SEEM RIGHT...
     ONLY YOU...
     CAN MAKE THIS DARKNESS LIGHT..."

Tony and Charlie look at each other. "Only you?" Then Charlie 
looks at his bride with confidence.

He walks over and joins her. She sings to him. It's a moment.

INT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY

Charlie and Harriet pick out a diamond ring.

INT. TRAVEL AGENCY

Charlie and Harriet point to brochures of the different cities 
they could go to on their honeymoon. They decide on a picture 
of the "DRY CREEK LODGE" in Oregon.

INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE

They are getting their blood tests back. Harriet looks at 
hers, casually. Charlie is nervous. Reluctantly he opens the 
file and looks at it. He is pleased with the results and 
does a victory dance.

EXT. SCOTTISH PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH - ESTABLISHING

INT. SCOTTISH PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH

Charlie and Harriet are being married. Harriet is in a 
beautiful wedding gown. Charlie is wearing a kilt. Tony is 
the best man. He also wears a kilt. Stuart, also kilted, 
May, the whole family along with a hundred well-wishers are 
in attendance. The SCOTTISH MINISTER presides. Rose is in a 
kilt.

          SCOTTISH MINISTER
     Now, Mr. MacKenzie, if you will take 
     this woman to be your wife, through 
     thick and thin, for better or for 
     worse, please say: "I do"...

          CHARLIE
     I do...

          SCOTTISH MINISTER
     Now Harriet, if you will take this 
     man, through good times and bad, for 
     ever and ever, as your husband, please 
     say "I Do"...

Harriet starts to speak; but right before the words come 
out, she stares into Charlie's eyes and STOPS. Charlie looks 
nervous. So does the Scottish Minister. So does Tony. So 
does everyone.

          HARRIET
          (after a long pause; 
          finally:)
     I do.

          SCOTTISH MINISTER
     Now Charlie... Kiss the beautiful 
     bride!

Charlie and Harriet kiss. We can see (though Charlie can't) 
Harriet has a strange unsure expression on her face. Tony 
notices it though and can't figure it out.

          STUART
     Let's get pissed.

The wedding march kicks in being played by a drunken Scotsman 
on BAGPIPES.

INT. RECEPTION HALL

A Scottish accordionist and a Drummer play SCOTLAND THE BRAVE. 
Some OLDER SCOTTISH AUNTIES are CLAPPING and HOOTING LOUDLY 
along with the tune. Some young girl COUSINS in traditional 
Scottish costume, dance the sword dance along to SCOTLAND 
THE BRAVE.

We pass the buffet which we see is catered by "Meats Of The 
World." Then we pass a very drunken Stuart in a heated 
discussion with four other people.

          STUART
     You know Golden Gate park was designed 
     by a Scotsman, MacClaren, which is 
     who MacClaren park was named after.

The others agree heartily.

May and Tony are dancing. May is dancing uncomfortably close. 
She keeps sliding her hand down to his ass, which he then 
has to move back to his shoulder.

Then we come to William, who's reluctantly at the children's 
table. All his little cousins are queuing up for a chance to 
feel his head.

We find Charlie in a corner. One of the hooting Scottish 
aunties is trying to get him to have another Scotch.

          AUNTIE MOLLY
          (proffering the Scotch)
     Charlie, get this down your neck.

          CHARLIE
     Auntie Molly if I have another one 
     I'll end up underneath the table 
     with my kilt over my head.

Tony joins them.

          TONY
     Where's Harriet?

          CHARLIE
     I don't know. Oh, there she is.

She's in the corner by herself looking weird and ominous. 
She has enough food in front or her for three people.

She eats ravenously and incessantly. Charlie goes over to 
her.

          CHARLIE
     A little hungry, were you?

At that moment, a FLASH goes off. Harriet looks up angrily.

          HARRIET
     What are you...!

Then she realizes it's Rose. She calms down and smiles. 
Charlie looks at her, a little peculiarly, but Harriet regains 
her composure.

          HARRIET
     Sorry. The flash just...

The band kicks into a new dance. A YOUNG BOY comes up to the 
bagpipe man with a shot of whiskey and whispers into his 
ear. The bagpipe man stops the song, downs the whiskey and 
then breaks into Rod Stewart's "IF YOU THINK I'M SEXY." From 
across the room we hear Stuart singing.

          STUART
          (full volume; singing)
     IF YOU THINK I'M SEXY...
     AND YOU WANT MY BODY...
     COME ON BABY LET ME KNOW.

Stuart gives the Bagpiper the thumbs up. The young people in 
the room start to jam, and then one by one the other guests 
start getting into the swing of things. The bagpipe man 
continues playing. It is clear that he is far too drunk to 
play. He slowly keels over, drunk. And as he falls over face 
first, he lands on his Bagpipes. The bagpipes let out an 
ATONAL DEFLATING SOUND like the last dying throes of a 
tortured animal. The BAGPIPE WAIL extends into the next scene.

EXT. HIGH ABOVE COAST - DAY

          CHARLIE (V.O.)
     Wait 'til you see this place, Harriet.

INT. CHARLIE'S CAR - DAY

They drive along the beautiful coast. Harriet is still eating. 
They're listening to TEENAGE FAN CLUB.

          CHARLIE
     This is Teenage Fan Club. They're 
     from Scotland.

          HARRIET
     They're great.

          CHARLIE
     We'll have the whole lodge to 
     ourselves practically.

          HARRIET
     I can't wait, Charlie.

          CHARLIE
     I wish you could be me, so you could 
     know how great it feels to be with 
     you.

          HARRIET
     It sounds wonderful

          CHARLIE
     Do you think that would be a good 
     line for a poem?

          HARRIET
     Honestly? It sounds a little Hallmark.

          CHARLIE
     Yeah, it's a little Seals and Croft. 
     I have a habit of sabotaging 
     relationships, and there were a 
     million times during me and you that 
     I could have blown this, and I just 
     thank God that I didn't...

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Tony is at his desk. The captain kicks open the door, knocking 
Tony's feet off the desk. The captain is now dressed in 
suspenders, a loosened tie, and a shirt with pit stains.

          CAPTAIN
     O.K., Spiletti, I got word from 
     upstairs that you been pokin' your 
     nose into that Ralph Elliot case.

          TONY
     Yes, Captain.

          CAPTAIN
     Don't "yes, Captain" me, Spiletti. 
     You're outta line. This is strictly 
     homicide.

          TONY
     Captain, I got this friend...

          CAPTAIN
     Friend? Yeah, we all got friends, 
     Spiletti. I'm warning you, Stay away 
     from this one. Back off, Italian 
     boy. You're getting too close to 
     this one.

          TONY
     Captain, I know what I'm doing. Trust 
     me. What's the news.

          CAPTAIN
     I can't believe I'm doing this, but 
     that girl who confused to Ralph 
     Elliot's murder also confessed to 
     other murders.

          TONY
     I knew she would! I knew it!

          CAPTAIN
     Yeah, apparently she also confessed 
     to killing Abe Lincoln, Julius Caesar, 
     and Warren G. Harding. She's a nut, 
     Spiletti!

          TONY
          (getting up)
     Oh, my god! I gotta go!

          CAPTAIN
     Yeah, screw this one up Spiletti and 
     you'll be writing parking tickets 
     for the rest of your days.

          TONY
     I won't let you down, Captain.

Tony exits for a beat, then pokes his head in the doorway.

          TONY
     That's much better Captain.

          CAPTAIN
          (nice again)
     You think so? Well, thank you very 
     much.

EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Tony hurries to his car.

EXT. GAS STATION ALONG THE COAST - DAY

They stop at a gas station with a small mini-mart. As Charlie 
is filling the tank he notices Harriet slipping the key out 
of the ignition before she walks to the mini-mart for more 
food.

          HARRIET
     You want anything?

          CHARLIE
     Lamb chops, creamed spinach, stuffed 
     tomatoes and a Hershey Bar.

Harriet arrives at the little Ma and Pa type mini-mart and 
smiles to Charlie.

          CHARLIE
     If they don't have all that, I'll 
     just take the Hershey bar.

EXT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Tony stands at the door, buzzing the buzzer to no response.

INT. CHARLIE'S CAR - EARLY EVENING

They are still driving along the coast. Charlie is eating 
his Hershey Bar. Harriet's eyes are becoming a bit glazed 
now, her movements a little static. She keeps looking behind 
them and out the window.

          CHARLIE
     What do you keep looking behind us 
     for?
          (joking)
     Is someone following you, or...?

          HARRIET
     They were. I think they're gone.

          CHARLIE
          (curious; pausing)
     What do you mean, they were?

          HARRIET
     The gas station guy. I thought he 
     was chasing us for a while, but I 
     guess he stopped.

          CHARLIE
     The gas station guy? Why would the 
     gas station guy chase us.

          HARRIET
     I don't know, Charlie. I guess for 
     not paying.

          CHARLIE
     What do you mean not paying? You 
     didn't pay him for the gas.

          HARRIET
     I forgot to pay... I didn't want to 
     be away from you for any longer.

          CHARLIE
     So, you just left.

          HARRIET
     Yes. And you're an accomplice.

He stops mid-bite on his Hershey Bar. He's confused.

          CHARLIE
     I'm not sure I understand.

          HARRIET
     Look, Charlie, don't you get it? 
     We're a team.

          CHARLIE
          (going with it)
     I can play that game. I'll get the 
     next gas station. Like Bonnie & Clyde.

He and Bonnie continue on the winding road and pass a sign 
that reads: "DRY CREEK LODGE - 40 MILES"

INT. HALLWAY - HARRIET'S APARTMENT - DAY

Tony knocks. No answer. He picks the lock and enters.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Rose is tied up and lying in a pool of blood. Tony stops for 
a beat, draws his gun and slowly walks over to her. Just as 
he gets there, a SHUTTER CLICKS.

          ROSE
     Oh, hi!

          TONY
          (practically hysterical)
     What is it with the women in your 
     family?

          ROSE
     I was just doing a murder series in 
     honor of the wedding.

          TONY
     Hey, this is real blood.

          ROSE
     Yes, Harriet, give it to me. She's a 
     butcher.
          (Tony reacts)
     ...She owns a butcher shop.

          TONY
     I need a picture of Harriet.

          ROSE
     Sorry. No can do.

          TONY
     You took a picture at the party. I 
     saw it.

          ROSE
     It didn't come out.

          TONY
     Look, Rose. I need a photo.

          ROSE
     The picture didn't come out.
          (he waits)
     It was unflattering. In made her 
     look ten pounds heavier.
          (he waits)
     She's my sister.

          TONY
     She's been implicated in a crime. I 
     need the photo to eliminate her as a 
     suspect.

          ROSE
     And if she's not innocent. If she's, 
     you know, "quirky?"

          TONY
     If she's "quirky" we'll save Charlie's 
     life.

Rose pulls out a photograph -- Charlie and Harriet. Looking 
young and in love.

EXT. DRY CREEK LODGE - LATE IN THE DAY

A beautiful old Colonial Mansion, nestled in the mountains 
and forests of the North-West. Romantic and from another 
day. Charlie and Harriet pull up in front of it.

The Valets open the door for them.

          HARRIET
     It's like a castle, Charlie. It's so 
     beautiful.

          VALET
     Welcome to the Dry Creek. You just 
     beat the rainstorm. Two hours later 
     and the roads'd probably be closed.

          CHARLIE
     Great. If you could help us with the 
     luggage, we have these two in the 
     back seat and...

As they deal with the luggage, Harriet starts to walk away 
from the hotel, away from the car, rain falling on her head. 
She walks straight at the CAMERA, so only we can see her 
expression. Her expression is one of simply "losing it".

          CHARLIE
     Harriet? What are you doing honey?

Harriet turns around and smiles at Charlie. He smiles back.

INT. LOBBY OF DRY CREEK LODGE - EVENING

Charlie and Harriet stand at the desk. Harriet is not quite 
paying attention. Her attention span has slipped to none. 
She's fidgety. She looks around suspiciously at everything 
and everyone.

          DESK CLERK
     Welcome, Sir. We have you with us 
     for four nights, Mr. MacKenzie. Dinner 
     reservations are at eight-thirty.

          CHARLIE
     Great. Sounds terrific.

          DESK CLERK
     Also, you might wanna prepare some 
     candles by the bed. We're expecting 
     the rainstorm to get even worse. We 
     might even lose the power tonight.

          CHARLIE
     Did you hear that, Harriet? A storm. 
     I can't think of anything more 
     romantic than the two of us trapped 
     in our room in the middle of a rain 
     storm.
          (noticing her)
     You okay, Harriet?

          HARRIET
     Just a little head-ache.
          (to clerk)
     Excuse me, is there a drug store in 
     the hotel? I want to get some aspirin.

          DESK CLERK
     Right beyond those trees, Ma'm. 
     Anything you need.

          HARRIET
     Thanks. Don't go anywhere. I'll be 
     right back.

Harriet walks off to the lobby store, backwards, looking at 
Charlie. Charlie watches her walk off. The Desk Clerk sits 
staring at Charlie.

          DESK CLERK
     You think she's really got a head-
     ache?

          CHARLIE
     What?

          DESK CLERK
     Ah, nothing. Here's your key. You're 
     in the Oak Room.

Charlie looks back at the drug store, where Harriet is 
shopping. She waves to him. Charlie looks back at the Desk 
Clerk and grabs the key.

                                   CUT TO:

FAX OF THE PHOTO OF CHARLIE & HARRIET

coming out of a fax machine.

INT. WALTER'S PLUMBING - EARLY EVENING

WALTER, the owner of the Plumbing store, dressed in overalls 
takes the Fax out and then picks up the phone.

          WALTER
     That's Ralph Elliot's wife, alright. 
     She had shorter hair in those days.

INT. MARTIAL ARTS STUDIO - NIGHT

MASTER CHO, the new owner of the studio, dressed in a gee, 
looks at the same fax.

          MASTER CHO
          (into phone)
     Mrs. Richter gain much weight since 
     then, but it's definitely her.

INT. THE LIZARD'S LOUNGE - ATLANTIC CITY

RANDY ROMANO, the owner, talks into the phone, holding up 
the faxed photo of Charlie and Harriet.

          RANDY
     That's his little lollipop, alright. 
     Boy he loved her. I'll tell you, she 
     was a lot of fun. Smart. A doll face 
     to boot.

INT. TONY'S CUBICLE - NIGHT

Tony is on the phone. Kathy, seen before at the police 
station, stands with him.

          TONY
     Circuits are out from the storm.

Tony gets to the police station door and opens it. Kathy 
follows him.

          TONY
          (to Kathy)
     Keep trying the hotel. Tell the chief 
     I just chartered a plane up to Oregon.

The Police Captain enters.

          CAPTAIN
          (points to his hair)
     See that Spiletti -- A gray hair! 
     Every day, Spiletti, I find another 
     one. And that's all due to you. Get 
     out there, and catch me some bad 
     guys!

          TONY
     Not now, Captain.

          CAPTAIN
          (nice again)
     Sorry.

Tony dashes out of the police station and into his car.

INT. CHARLIE'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

A beautiful suite, with a fireplace burning a big stack of 
wood, with another stack next to it, with an AXE in it. Music 
is playing softly on the stereo. And Charlie and Harriet 
have just finished making love underneath the covers, 
illuminated just by the light of the fireplace.

          CHARLIE
     This is the best honeymoon I could 
     ever imagine, Harriet. If we had to 
     pack and go home right now, I'd still 
     think it was the greatest honeymoon 
     ever.

Harriet doesn't respond. Her head is turned from his.

          CHARLIE
     Don't you agree, Harriet? Harriet?

He pulls the sheets away from her face to see that she is 
crying.

          CHARLIE
          (wiping her tears)
     What? What are you crying? What is 
     it?

          HARRIET
     It's nothing. It's just... I was 
     just thinking... We're married now. 
     And I always wanted to try and have 
     kids, and...

          CHARLIE
     So do I. Look, there's nothing more 
     I'd like to do than have, kids, or...

          HARRIET
     It's just, I get scared that certain 
     things will happen, or...

          CHARLIE
     What are you talking about? You're 
     gonna be a great Mom. I know you 
     will.

          HARRIET
     It's not that, Charlie.

          CHARLIE
     What then?

          HARRIET
     You're gonna laugh.

          CHARLIE
     Tell me. Of course I'm not gonna 
     laugh. Kids is a big thing. It's 
     hard. I'm sure I have the same fears.

          HARRIET
     If we have kids, Charlie, things 
     happen. Kids are healthy and fine, 
     and some aren't, and I don't know if 
     I could live with myself if I gave 
     birth to a child with webbed feet.

Charlie stops to think about this. Webbed feet?

          CHARLIE
     Webbed feet?

          HARRIET
     You're laughing.

          CHARLIE
     No, I'm not laughing.

          HARRIET
     You think that's silly?

          CHARLIE
     No, no. That's a natural fear. I've 
     thought about that fear.

          HARRIET
     It really worries me, Charlie.

          CHARLIE
          (quite confused)
     Well, look, they have, doctors -- I 
     assume -- that deal, only with, webbed 
     feet. And, God Forbid, and I'm talking 
     strictly hypothetically, should that 
     happen, we'll find one.

          HARRIET
          (kissing him; happy 
          now)
     You're the greatest Charlie.

          CHARLIE
          (confused, to say the 
          least)
     Thanks. We should get ready for 
     dinner.

EXT./INT. CHARTERED CESSNA - NIGHT

A small plane flies through the clouds. It's just Tony and 
DENNIS the pilot.

Dennis never really realizes this is more than a sightseeing 
tour, and constantly points out scenic points along the way.

          DENNIS
     Out your left side, you can see the 
     Sierra Nevada, which is the largest 
     mountain range west of the Rockies...

          TONY
     Great. Rockies. I don't care. Oregon. 
     Move.

INT. CHARLIE'S HOTEL ROOM AT DRY CREEK LODGE - NIGHT

Charlie is dressed very sharply in sport coat and tie. He 
yells into the bathroom where we can see part of Harriet 
from behind.

          CHARLIE
     You almost ready? The first seating 
     is in five minutes.

          HARRIET
          (from other room)
     I just wanna look good for you, 
     Charlie. That's all.

          CHARLIE
     I'm sure you look great. I'm sure 
     you look...

Harriet turns the corner, wearing a nice dress. Her hair 
looks okay. She's wearing perfume. The only problem is, she 
has two lines of mascara running down her cheeks. She's been 
crying. Charlie looks curious.

          HARRIET
     Do I look okay, Charlie?

          CHARLIE
     Yes. Well...

Charlie points to his own eye.

          HARRIET
     What's wrong?

          CHARLIE
     Nothing. You kind of look like Tammy 
     Faye Baker right now.

She looks in the mirror.

          HARRIET
     Oh, yeah.

She goes back into the bathroom.

EXT. CESSNA - NIGHT

The plane descends towards the runway. The rain comes down 
hard.

          DENNIS (V.O.)
     As we prepare to land, we can see 
     off to our left Lake Shanony, which 
     is...

          TONY (V.O.)
     Just land. Don't worry about Lake 
     Shanony. I don't give a shit about 
     Lake Shanony.

The plane touches down.

EXT. DRY CREEK LODGE - NIGHT

Rain pours fantastically on the gothic castle. Wind blows 
hard.

          MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
     A toast to our new friends, Charlie 
     and Harriet...

INT. BEAUTIFUL FRENCH RESTAURANT IN HOTEL - NIGHT

A beautiful dining room with a small dance floor. Charlie 
sits at an intimate table for two with Harriet. A small band 
plays in the b.g., as the BAND LEADER is making the toast. 
The five or six other couples in the restaurant also hold up 
their glass.

          BAND LEADER
     ...we're honored to be here for this 
     very special day in...

The CONCIERGE at this point interrupts to bring Charlie a 
TELEPHONE. Everyone stops and watches and waits.

          CONCIERGE
     I'm sorry to interrupt, Sir. There's 
     a phone call for you from town.
          (Charlie takes phone)
     They say it's quite urgent.

The toast, as well as the entire room, stops -- almost like 
an E.F. Hutton commercial, waiting for Charlie's phone call 
to finish.

          CHARLIE
          (curious)
     Hello?

INT. AIRPORT IN OREGON - EARLY EVENING

Tony speaks into the phone frantically.

          TONY
     Charlie, you okay?

INTERCUT PHONE CALL

          CHARLIE
     Great. Couldn't be better.

          TONY
     Charlie, listen to me! It's her! 
     Harriet is Mrs. X! She killed Ralph 
     and the two other men!

Charlie looks up across the table at Harriet who is completely 
caught up in the event of seeing how long she can keep her 
hand in the candle before it hurts.

She puts it in, smiles then takes it out. She shakes her 
hand, and repeats the process.

          CHARLIE
          (talking softly)
     Look, that's great -- it just so 
     happens though, that I met...
          (louder than he had 
          hoped)
     Ralph, and much to my delight, not 
     only is she alive, but she's female. 
     I thought I told you.

Harriet looks at Charlie, very suspiciously. He looks back 
at her, and tries to smile, pretending that he is having a 
pleasant, and completely irrelevant conversation.

          TONY
     Rose had a picture. It checked out. 
     It's her, Charlie. She is the 
     murderer.

          HARRIET
     Charlie, your food is getting cold.

Charlie waves "One Minute" to Harriet, as she watches.

          CHARLIE
     So, what do I do?

          TONY
     I called the police. All the roads 
     are closed, but they're on their 
     way. In the mean time just...

The line goes DEAD.

          CHARLIE
     Hello?
          (pressing receiver)
     Hello?

          HARRIET
     What's a matter, Charlie?

          CHARLIE
          (to concierge)
     The phone just went dead. I was on 
     the phone and it went dead.

          CONCIERGE
     That's quite common, sir. I'm sure 
     the lines'll be out in the whole 
     city 'til tomorrow. Enjoy your meal, 
     Sir.

The Concierge takes the phone away. Charlie turns slowly to 
Harriet, genuinely scared.

          HARRIET
     What happened, Charlie?

          CHARLIE
     Nothing... Nothing happened. Just 
     the lines are down. Phone lines.

Suddenly, the band leader continues with his toast.

          BAND LEADER
          (over microphone)
     ...so to these two young people, we 
     wish them a long and happy life 
     together and would like to play their 
     song. The Platters -- "Only You".

The band starts to play "Only You".

People APPLAUD. Harriet and Charlie just stare at each other. 
He knows.

The older couple at the next table, MR. & MRS. LEVENSTEIN, 
lean over to their table.

          MR. LEVENSTEIN
     How about the traditional Bride & 
     Groom dance?

Another couple walks by and pulls them literally out of the 
their seats and onto the dance floor.

          OTHER COUPLE
     Come on. It's a tradition.

Charlie finds himself in the middle of the dance floor dancing 
slowly with Harriet. He's scared out of his mind. The music 
plays in the background. Harriet smiles strangely at him. He 
tries to smile back, checking all the Exits, planning an 
escape.

Then suddenly, call it luckily, MR. LEVENSTEIN, interrupts:

          MR. LEVENSTEIN
     Excuse me. Could I cut in on your 
     dance?

          CHARLIE
     Of course. Sure...

Charlie gives her hand away to Mr. Levenstein. He takes Mrs. 
Levenstein's hand and starts to dance towards the EXIT, when 
suddenly the ELECTRICITY GOES OUT. The MUSIC is out. The 
LIGHTS ARE OUT.

In the dimmest of lights provided from the cloud covered 
moon outside, Charlie runs across the dance floor, fighting 
for an exit to the outside.

He arrives in someone's arms on his way.

          CHARLIE
     I need your help! You have to help 
     me! I've married a...!

The LIGHTS GO BACK ON and Charlie is in HARRIET'S ARMS again. 
Her face is near menacing now. She smiles a very disturbed 
grin. He doesn't know what to say.

          HARRIET
          (much too pleasant)
     Hello, Charlie.

Charlie and her are squared off. Neither speak. Suddenly 
both of them are lifted into the air. They look down and see 
the waiters and busboys picking them up onto chairs, throwing 
them up in the air again and again. The MUSIC plays along 
loudly.

Harriet watches Charlie very closely, as Charlie looks scared. 
Then, the people start to carry them out of the room and 
down the hallway.

          WAITER
     Let's take 'em to their room.

          CONCIERGE
     Yeah, I'm sure they've had enough of 
     these crowds for one night.

          CHARLIE
     My dinner. I didn't finish my dinner 
     yet.

          HARRIET
     Smile, Charlie. Act like you're having 
     a good time.

INT. OREGON AIRPORT - SAME/NIGHT

Tony is talking to an attractive young girl behind the airport 
Rent-A-Car booth.

          RENT-A-CAR GIRL
     I'm sorry, Sir. The roads are all 
     closed. We can't rent any cars this 
     evening.

          TONY
     You have to rent me something. I've 
     gotta get up there. My friend's in 
     danger...

INT. CHARLIE & HARRIET'S ROOM - NIGHT

The other hotel guests threw them inside. The room is all 
made up, the sheets are pulled down, the firewood is cut, 
the AXE is in the wood.

          CONCIERGE
     Have a good night, you two.

          CHARLIE
     Come on in. Stay for a nightcap.

          BELLBOY
     No, you two wanna be alone. See you.

          CHARLIE
          (demanding)
     Stay for a nightcap!

          BELLBOY
     Sir, I really don't think I should

          CHARLIE
          (shouting)
     STAY FOR A NIGHTCAP!

The bellboy is frightened and runs away.

          CHARLIE
          (shouting down the 
          hall after him)
     STAY FOR A NIGHTCAP!

Harriet pulls Charlie back into the room, frightened that 
he's leaving.

          HARRIET
     Don't go, Charlie.

EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

Tony runs out of the airport terminal where he sees a man in 
his forties who's just entered his four wheel drive jeep.

          TONY
          (flashing his badge)
     Excuse me, Sir, I'm with the San 
     Francisco Police Department. I'm on 
     official business and I'm afraid I 
     have to commandeer your vehicle.

          MAN
          (unfazed)
     No.

          TONY
     What do you mean no?!

          MAN
     I happen to know for a fact that you 
     don't have the power to commandeer 
     my vehicle.

          TONY
     This is true.
          (pause)
     Please can I commandeer your vehicle?

          MAN
     Well, where are you going?

          TONY
     To The Dry Creek Lodge.

          MAN
     I'll give you a lift.

          TONY
     Well, I don't want a lift, I really 
     want to commandeer the vehicle. Please 
     just let me commandeer the vehicle.

          MAN
     Why don't you just let me drive you 
     there? Really, I don't mind, it's on 
     my way.
          (pause)

          TONY
     You're not going to bend on the 
     commandeering thing are you?

          MAN
     No.

          TONY
     Well, if we get stopped will you at 
     least let me say that I commandeered 
     the vehicle, but I let you drive?

          MAN
     I'm uncomfortable with that.

          TONY
     Please?

          MAN
     All right.

INT. CHARLES AND HARRIET'S ROOM

Charlie & Harriet are all alone. The voices trail off down 
the hallway until they disappear. Charlie and Harriet stare 
at each other. Harriet blocks the door. Charlie looks around 
the room. The Axe. The Corkscrew. The letter opener. The 
fountain pen. At this point, everything in the room looks 
like a potential weapon. Harriet takes the axe.

          HARRIET
     I heard you on the phone before, 
     Charlie. There's something I've got 
     to tell you.

          CHARLIE
          (frightened)
     Harriet, I...

          HARRIET
     I've been married before.

          CHARLIE
     I already know.

          HARRIET
     About my husbands?

          CHARLIE
     Yes. And I was meaning to have a 
     word with you. We could get an 
     annulment.

          HARRIET
          (screams)
     AAAhhhhhhh!

Suddenly the power goes off again. They're both in the dark. 
A scuffle. Charlie has restrained Harriet, throws her in a 
walk-in closet and locks it. From behind the door, we hear 
Harriet WAILING. Which continues.

Charlie picks up the axe, looks at it, relieved at his lucky 
escape. He rushes to the door to escape. He opens it and 
standing there is Rose.

          CHARLIE
     Aaaaah, Rose, I never thought I'd be 
     so glad to see you.

Rose smiles. Charlie puts down the axe. The lights flicker 
back on.

          CHARLIE
          (going to the phone)
     Maybe the phones are working again 
     by now.

He listens for a dial tone. Beside the phone he sees a note. 
He starts to read is:

          CHARLIE
     'Dear, Harriet. I just can't handle 
     the commitment. I'm leaving you.' 
     Signed, 'Charlie.'

And behind him Rose approaches with the axe raised.

          CHARLIE
     What the hell is this? I didn't write 
     this?

And at that moment he turns to find the AXE BEING FLUNG 
THROUGH THE AIR AT his head. He ducks just in time.

          CHARLIE
     What the fuck?!

She takes another swing and she hits the lamp off the desk 
and the room is in complete DARKNESS.

          ROSE
     Charlie. Why did you marry Harriet? 
     I warned you not to marry her, didn't 
     I? I warned all of them. But none of 
     them listened to me. They all went 
     ahead and married her. She's the 
     pretty one. Where's Harriet? What 
     have you done with my sister, Harriet?

          CHARLIE
     Nothing, Rose.

          ROSE
     If you've done something to my sister, 
     Harriet, I swear to God I'll kill 
     you.

We stay in Charlie's hip pocket as he tries to get away from 
what he can't see. He stays very silent.

          HARRIET
          (from the closet)
     Where are you, Charlie? What's going 
     on?

Then Rose strikes a match. She lights a candle and comes 
toward him. He looks around. The window is open. And Charlie 
is gone.

INT. COMMANDEERED CAR - NIGHT

Tony and the commandeered man drive through the swampy, 
winding road on the way up to the hotel. Tony is drumming on 
the dash.

          MAN
     Could you stop doing that please?

EXT. CASTLE-LIKE ROUND TOWER/LEDGE OF TOWER - NIGHT

Charlie tightropes along the ledge of the building. The storm 
continues. Rose comes out on the ledge and starts to chase 
him. He rounds the bend. Charlie looks into one room and 
sees MR. & MRS. LEVENSTEIN there. There's loud OPERA MUSIC 
playing in the room

          CHARLIE
     Call the police!

INT. THE LEVENSTEIN'S ROOM - NIGHT SAME

The Levensteins prepare for bed. Charlie races by their 
window. Then Rose races by.

          CHARLIE
     Call the police!

Mr. Levenstein closes the curtains. He can't hear.

EXT. LEDGE - NIGHT

Charlie races along the slippery ledge, almost falling at 
several points. Rose then appears on the roof holding the 
Axe, still.

          ROSE
          (mostly to herself; 
          slurring most words)
     Charlie, did you like your note? I 
     thought it was pretty accurate. I 
     did all the husbands' notes. I can 
     forge anyone's handwriting, I can 
     write in anyone's style. See, I'm an 
     artist. Harriet isn't an artist. 
     Sure she could get a husband, but 
     she could never have done this. And 
     you know what I'm most proud of?

          CHARLIE
     What's that, Rose?

          ROSE
     Harriet never knew. She thought they 
     all just left her. I protected her. 
     She's my sister.

Charlie turns and runs. Rose chases him.

INT. BEDROOM

Tony breaks into the room with his gun drawn.

          TONY
          (shouting)
     Charlie!

          HARRIET
          (from closet)
     Tony, is that you? It's me, Harriet. 
     I'm in here.

Carefully, Tony opens the closet door.

          HARRIET
     Tony, Rose is trying to kill Charlie. 
     They're out on the ledge.

          TONY
          (not believing)
     Get on the floor and put your hands 
     behind your back.

Harriet willingly goes on the floor.

          HARRIET
     Sure, anything. You've got to save 
     Charlie.

Tony slaps cuffs on her and takes her to the window.

INT. BEDROOM

Tony is standing with his back to the window, between it and 
Harriet. She looks out of the window and screams.

          HARRIET
     Look! It's Charlie!

From Harriet's POV we see Charlie on the ledge edging along. 
He stops in horror when he sees Harriet, glances back to the 
pursuing Rose, and rushes off.

Tony looks behind him out the window. Nobody is there.

          TONY
     Nice try.

          HARRIET
     I swear to you... It was Charlie... 
     Look! Now there's Rose!

Rose looks into the room, with the axe in her hand.

          TONY
     No you don't.

          HARRIET
     I beg you... Look! It is Rose.

          TONY
     Oh no, not again.
          (he glances at the 
          window)
     Aaaaah! Rose.

INT. LEVENSTEIN'S WINDOW

There is opera music playing. Charlie rushes by, past the 
window. There is a beat and he comes back, staring inside in 
amazement.

REVERSE ANGLE

Mr. Levenstein is in a Viking outfit. Mrs. Levenstein is in 
full Norse Regalia.

INT. LEVENSTEIN'S WINDOW

Charlie gulps and rushes on, hastily pursued by Rose.

INT. THE ROOF

Rose pulls the Axe back and swings, and the momentum of the 
swing pulls her feet out from under her, and on the slippery 
icy roof she falls and starts to slide.

Just as she's about to go off the fifty foot high roof, 
Charlie climbs down the roof. He stands over her. She's about 
to slip. Her hands are losing strength. Her fingers are 
slipping. The rain is falling harder and harder.

Charlie walks over to the cage where she's hanging on for 
life.

He leans down to help her up, but just as he grabs on to her 
hand, the drainpipe she's holding onto slips.

She is now dangling from the roof, the rain falling harder 
and harder. Charlie now is nowhere near her. He then gets 
down on his knees on the roof and starts to climb down the 
side of the drainpipe to get her.

Rose looks up helplessly at him. Not really asking for his 
help. Not denying it. She's accepted her fate.

Policemen, ambulances and spectators have gathered below in 
bunches as Charlie climbs down the drainpipe, he himself 
hanging on for dear life.

He just reaches out far enough to grab her hand, and just as 
he does, her drainpipe tears and falls into the crowd below. 
Charlie, then with all his strength -- his "where has this 
strength been my whole life" strength -- pulls her up to the 
roof next to him.

Several policemen make their way onto the roof and come over 
to where Charlie is detaining Rose. The police take her, 
handcuff her and cart her away. From the corner of the roof 
appears Tony.

          TONY
     I hate to bother you on your 
     honeymoon, Charlie, but...

Charlie looks beyond Tony and sees Harriet standing in the 
doorway. He goes over and puts his arm around Harriet.

          CHARLIE
     Thank God. I'm sorry I doubted you, 
     but I thought you were the killer, 
     but you were acting pretty strange?

          HARRIET
     I thought you were going to leave 
     me, like the others. Thank God they 
     were just murdered. I thought they 
     were always leaving me.

Below, Rose is put into a police car and taken off. The SIRENS 
disappear. So do the crowds.

                                             DISSOLVE INTO:

THE SOUND OF A CROWD IN A CLUB:

INT. SPILETTI'S COFFEE HOUSE

Charlie is on stage looking very beatnik. He's reading his 
poetry, but we can't hear it. He nods to someone off stage. 
Harriet is in the audience, also looking very beatnik with 
their three year old son, STUART, a miniature beatnik version 
of Charlie.

          CHARLIE (V.O.)
     My dad was right. You don't lose 
     your muse once you're married. Nothing 
     changed, except I gained a great 
     son, Stuart.

SOUND UP on Charlie's poetry.

          CHARLIE
     MARRIED MAN
     MOST MERRY
     AND IN CONCLUSION

          CROWD AND CHARLIE
     THIS POEM SUCKS.

The crowd goes crazy.

          CHARLIE
     Thank you very much.

HOUSE MUSIC kicks on. It's Saturday Night by the Bay City 
Rollers.

          BAY CITY ROLLERS
     S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y NIGHT

Charlie comes off stage and joins his wife and child at their 
table. He is very happy.

                                   FADE OUT:

                    THE END
