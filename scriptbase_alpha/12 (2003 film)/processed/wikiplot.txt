The film is a postmodern spoof that tells the story of Zeus' modern day illegitimate children, Filmore (Tony Griffin) and his half-sister Marie-Noel (Alison Elliott), who are forced to move from their Channel Island ranch because their neighbors have grown suspicious of the fact they haven't aged for decades.
Meanwhile the U.S. government wants to turn their land into a national park.
When the twelve Greek Gods return to Los Angeles for relaxation Zeus expects them to correctly identify the play fated and modeled around their current lives—Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest—and perform the work flawlessly, in its entirety, for the Gods' entertainment.
By such means, as the play's plot unfolds, the children are guaranteed new, credible lives.
"Act or die," he commands.
But if they fail to perform the play to its conclusion, or if they rebel, they will be killed by jealous Hera.
The mere existence of these illegitimate children are an outrage to her, representing Zeus' countless infidelities.

12—whose title is often mistakenly derived from the number of years it took to create the film (10 actually)—is described by Variety as "equal parts L.A. love story, The Importance of Being Earnest, spoof on Greek gods and personal diary of actual events from 1988 to 1998.
