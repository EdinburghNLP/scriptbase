ALLEN, a stout comedian, at a temp job, answering

               TALK SHOW HOST (V.O.)
     And we're back with "Interpreting 
     Your Dreams."  And I believe we 
     have Allen in Hollywood on line...
     12. Hello Allen...are you there? 
     Hello..?

ALLEN has the TALK SHOW HOST on hold so he doesn't 
hear her.


               ALLEN
     Okay...hold on. Yeah I'll take care of 
     you in a second...I'm transferring 
     you over..

               TALK SHOW HOST
     We are live on the air....Hello...?

               ALLEN
     Hello.? Yeah okay I've got somebody else 
     on hold...I'm going to transfer you 
     over. It might be a second, just hold on.

               TALK SHOW HOST
     (aside) I'm on hold..

EXTERIOR - THE BIG ISLAND FROM ABOVE - DAY
The Big Island floats in sparkling light. WE HEAR a 
radio show filtered through the small speaker of an 
old radio.
          

               TALK SHOW HOST
     Okay, we're going to have to go...
     
               ALLEN
     Okay, oh doctor.

               TALK SHOW HOST
     Hello?

EXTERIOR - RANCH HOUSE FROM ABOVE - DAY
We see rooftops of ranch buildings from high above.
We HEAR the sound of a plane flying overhead. We 
HEAR ALLEN'S voice.


               ALLEN
     Are you there?

EXTERIOR - RANCH HOUSE - DAY
The Ranch House stands isolated in a dry island 
valley. The plane passes overhead.


               TALK SHOW HOST
     You're live on the air.

INSERT VIEW on RADIO. We HEAR

               ALLEN
     Can I use my real name on the radio?

INTERIOR - RANCH HOUSE - DAY
MARIE-NOEL is sitting in front of a mirror putting 
on her makeup. She is listening to the broadcast. 
She pays attention to ALLEN's dream when he says the 
word "invisible".

The TALK SHOW HOST speaks flatly, angrily.


               TALK SHOW HOST
     What is your dream?

               ALLEN
     First of all I'm invisible. I see 
     myself looking in a mirror. I'm 
     having this dream almost every night.

MARIE-NOEL listens more carefully to the radio.


               TALK SHOW HOST
     Yes?

VIEW ON: A Sparkling lake. 

VIEW ON: MARIE-NOEL throwing bouquet at her wedding.


               ALLEN
     And the next thing you know I'm 
     getting married. I don't know to 
     whom....

INTERIOR - RANCH HOUSE - DAY
MARIE-NOEL looks in the mirror again; the 
conversation on the radio affirms something she 
knows to be true.


               TALK SHOW HOST
     And how long have you been having 
     this dream?

               ALLEN
     Like an entire solid month.

               TALK SHOW HOST
     Uh huh...

EXTERIOR - LA HARBOR - DAY
A truck wipes the frame and we see MARIE-NOEL 
walking along the highway at a leisurely pace.


               ALLEN
     Then all of a sudden I see myself 
     walking down a road by the harbor....

The TALK SHOW HOST interrupts. WE HEAR a telephone 
ring.


               TALK SHOW HOST
     And how do you feel at this point 
     in the dream?

EXTERIOR - LA - NIGHT
TONY, having been stopped by the truck, cuts down a 
side street to get around the gridlock. We HEAR 
ALLEN's phone RING.


               ALLEN
     Can you hold on for one second...
     Hello.  

               TALK SHOW HOST
     No, actually we can't...Hello?

INTERIOR - OFFICE - DAY
ALLEN is trying to juggle too many things at once. 
He tries to transfer incoming calls without losing 
them. He has the TALK SHOW HOST on hold again.


               ALLEN
     Yeah, I've got two other lines. 
     Can you hold a second? Great....

               TALK SHOW HOST
     Hello! Allen from Hollywood!

               ALLEN
     Hello...yeah...hold on. I can 
     transfer you now.

EXTERIOR - HARBOR - DAY
A MAN fixes the tire of an old Mercedes as MARIE-
NOEL walks into frame. MARIE-NOEL stoops down and 
looks at his face. The man has no awareness of her. 
She is invisible.


               TALK SHOW HOST
     Are you there? Hello?

               ALLEN
     Hi. Hi. Sorry.

               TALK SHOW HOST
     Allen we don't have the time....

               ALLEN
     Sorry..

               TALK SHOW HOST
     Allen we're on the air and you 
     can not put me on hold.

               ALLEN
     I'm really sorry....

               TALK SHOW HOST
     Go on with your dream Allen.

               ALLEN
     Am I on?

               TALK SHOW HOST
     Yes.

               ALLEN
     Okay. I'm walking along the road down 
     by the harbor, and I'm invisible, and 
     I go around looking at people knowing 
     that they can't even see me and in 
     this dream.....

INTERIOR - CAR - DAY
MARIE-NOEL is now in the car with the driver who 
fixed the flat. The driver cannot see her and MARIE-
NOEL flicks his ear to tease him and test her 
invisibility.


               ALLEN
     ... I ride around with people. I get 
     in their cars, I go all over town.

INTERIOR - OFFICE - DAY
ALLEN has risen to a peak in energy.


               ALLEN
     I mean here...this, this, this.

               TALK SHOW HOST
     And how does it feel to you?

VIEW on PHONE: WE HEAR a RING
          
               ALLEN
     Can you hold on a second?

NOTE: DISCONTINUITY - Glasses disappear from 
ALLEN's Hand.

VIEW ON ALLEN
He turns to a colleague in the office while the TALK 
SHOW HOST languishes on hold.
          

               ALLEN
     I've got two juice commercials. I'm 
     like the spokesman for the company now. 
     I got a Baske and Robbins, and I'm on 
     avail for a couple of beer things that 
     are going on..

WE HEAR another RING. A hand in the foreground 
picks up a phone. ALLEN goes back to the line of 
the TALK SHOW HOST.


               COLLEAGUE
     Hello...

               ALLEN
     Dr. Powell I'm back....

EXTERIOR - LA - NIGHT
TONY continues his shortcut around the gridlock. His
car passes camera in a suburban neighborhood.


               TALK SHOW HOST
     I think we're running out of time 
     here Allen.

               ALLEN
     Sorry to put you on hold....You 
     see then I get out of the car... 

EXTERIOR - LA - EVENING
ALLEN walks from his job to his car.

          
               ALLEN
     ...and I walk all day...

EXTERIOR - LA - NIGHT
MARIE-NOEL walks down Hollywood Blvd. Creatures of 
the night surround her.


               ALLEN
     ...and all night.

               TALK SHOW HOST
     Don't put me on hold...

EXTERIOR - LA - NIGHT
ALLEN walking on a back street.


               ALLEN
     No, no, no, no. I'm at work. I'm at work. 

               TALK SHOW HOST
     Is this a real call?

               ALLEN
     What do you think? Do you think I'd 
     make a fake call in the middle of work?

EXTERIOR - SIDE STREET LA - NIGHT
TONY turns the corner and heads back to Melrose 
toward a point beyond the gridlock.


               TALK SHOW HOST     
     I'm feeling very left out here because 
     you're not telling me how you feel.  
     I'm telling you....

EXTERIOR - MELROSE BLVD.- NIGHT
MARIE-NOEL walks toward camera as ALLEN enters frame
on the left. ALLEN and MARIE-NOEL pass at the corner. 
Neither notices the other. TONY pulls into the frame
at the intersection and MARIE-NOEL sees TONY who 
does not notice either ALLEN or MARIE-NOEL. MARIE-
NOEL runs to TONY'S convertible car and jumps in the
back. She rides joyfully as TONY speeds off.


               ALLEN
     And then this really strange thing 
     happens.

               TALK SHOW HOST
     What do you do for a living?

               ALLEN
     While I'm walking...I'm an Actor...
     
               TALK SHOW HOST
     So in other words you are in limbo in 
     your daily life.
                    
               ALLEN
     I'm walking, and I see myself walking, 
     but I don't stop, I just keep on walking.

               TALK SHOW HOST
     You must be feeling invisible in your 
     daily life and it's coming out in your 
     dreams.

               ALLEN
     I want to know what you think about the 
     dream, let me finish it! Can you hold on 
     a second please?

               TALK SHOW HOST
     You can not put me on hold....I'm sorry 
     but we're going to have to go to Mike 
     in Downey on line 13.  Thank you very much 
     for calling.


TITLE: "START HERE"

EXTERIOR - LA - SUNRISE
We see a distant mountain silhouetted against the
morning light. We HEAR a plane in the distance. The 
plane is visible as a speck in the frame and flies 
close to the mountain. The sun rises to the opening 
cadence of:

MUSIC: MOZART SYMPHONY 34 #1

The plane grows more faint as the sun continues to 
rise.


EXTERIOR - PARK - SUNRISE
TONY and MARIE-NOEL walk across a playing field. 
They look behind them fearfully.

MUSIC: Evan Lurie "Deception"


               TONY
     Come on...

               MARIE-NOEL
     This isn't the way we came.

               TONY
     Yes it is.

TITLE: "ACTOR CREDIT"

EXTERIOR - PARK - SUNRISE
TONY and MARIE-NOEL arrive at a park bench.  They
sit on top of it, resting, waiting, then they 
interrupt each other.


               TONY
     Let's not.

               MARIE-NOEL
     Let's not. Sorry.

               TONY
     We'll just go home and we'll wait it out.

               MARIE-NOEL
     This place stinks!

MARIE-NOEL stands up and moves to the other side of 
the bench, her back towards TONY.

EXTERIOR - PALACE - NIGHT
BRENDA walks through the rain toward the doors of 
the concert. Wawa guitar bursts from the inside 
through the unopened doors. BRENDA looks murderous 
in her wild hair and hot pants.

INTERIOR - HALLOWEEN PARTY
TONY and MARIE-NOEL wander separately around the 
party as costumed hipsters sway with the music. TWO 
WOMEN react in horror as something unseen occurs 
which causes the crowd to panic. A SHEEP is left 
standing in the empty hall.

TITLE: "ACTOR CREDIT"

EXTERIOR - BENCH IN SAME PARK - SUNRISE
TONY and MARIE-NOEL both scratch their ears at the 
same time. A faint sound of thunder causes TONY to 
look into the distance. They interrupt each other 
again.


               TONY
     Let's not.

               MARIE-NOEL
     You know.....You know, at this point I'm 
     blaming it all on bad karma. This is how
     we die, man. I wish they'd just get it 
     over with.

MUSIC STARTS


               TONY
     Don't give up. I mean nothing has happened 
     to us. She'll probably be at the boat waiting 
     for us when we get there.

EXTERIOR - ADJACENT STREET - SUNRISE
BRENDA fast walks on a street next to the park.  As 
she approaches, she suddenly stops. WE HEAR the 
sound of rain. It is a clear morning.  Perplexed, 
she laughs. 

EXTERIOR - PARK - SUNRISE
TONY and MARIE-NOEL walk urgently through a wooded 
section of the park. The sound of thunder gets 
louder and louder getting closer to them. TONY grabs
MARIE-NOEL'S arm as the fearful sound passes close 
to them without incident.

EXTERIOR - ADJACENT STREET - SUNRISE
BRENDA walks past the camera, still perplexed by the
odd occurrence.  

EXTERIOR - LA - SUNRISE
We see the mountain again and continue to HEAR the 
airplane.

EXTERIOR - WEST LOS ANGELES - SUNRISE
The fog is coming in. Tops of buildings disappear.


               TONY
     Let's not be naive about the earthquake...

EXTERIOR - CENTURY CITY FROM THE AIR - SUNRISE
The fog gets thicker...
 
     
               TONY
     It's a good sign...

VIEW on WILSHIRE BLVD...Thick Fog.


               TONY
     That's what saved us.

EXTERIOR - LA - SUNRISE
We see the silhouette of buildings from a distance. 
The sun rises above them.

EXTERIOR - PARK - SUNRISE
TONY and MARIE-NOEL continue to walk urgently 
through a wooded section of the park.


               MARIE-NOEL
     Let me tell you, I had a premonition. I had 
     the worst feeling when she said she was going 
     to go up and see the band.

EXTERIOR - PARK - DAY
TONY and MARIE-NOEL walk along, totally engulfed in 
fog. 

               MARIE-NOEL
     What if we get it for not warning her?

THEIR POV
We see a sheep standing beside a tree in the fog.

EXTERIOR - PARK - MORNING 
Through a fog we see a sheep standing next to a tree. 
MARIE-NOEL and TONY arrive at the tree. They are 
horrified. 

INTERIOR - ALLEN'S BEDROOM - MORNING
ALLEN's phone rings. He wakes suddenly and sits up 
in bed; his answering machine goes on. 

We HEAR MUSIC: "Be My Baby" 
coming from a source outside of the bedroom.


               ALLEN'S VOICE
     Hi this is ALLEN at 969-8895. I'm not 
     home right now but if you want to leave 
     me a message I'll get back to you as soon 
     as you can...

ALLEN listens for a minute. He is not quite awake.

TITLE: "Actor Credit"
 
ALLEN gets up and walks to the mirror waiting for 
his long message to end. He looks melodramatically 
at his face. We HEAR THUNDER.  He pulls at his face.
He sits back down on his bed waiting to see if 
someone is on the line.


               ALLEN'S VOICE
     If it's important and during the day you 
     can call me at Knapp Communications. The 
     number is (213) 932-1465. Uh, I should be 
     there all day. And if it's not important 
     and you don't want to call me there leave 
     a message on this machine but don't hang 
     up I really hate that and, uh,that's it, bye.

We HEAR a BEEP but no one is on the line. ALLEN's 
head hits the pillow and he flashes to.

Clip of Scorcese's Mean Streets. Where Keitel's head
hits the pillow.

ALLEN walking satisfied.
                                             
SCENE FROM ALLEN's Pizza commercial, elbows out.

EXTERIOR - STREET IN FRONT OF ALAN'S APARTMENT
Camera dollies past a pickup truck.  The back of the
truck is filled with shopping carts.  A man is 
loading shopping carts into the truck. As the camera 
reaches the door of the truck we hear the source of 
the loud music. We see EUGENE, a homeless man, who 
has his hand out to the driver of the truck. The 
truck pulls away and EUGENE looks around in 
confusion. We HEAR THUNDER. EUGENE looks at ALLEN's 
building.

SCENE FROM ALLEN's deodorant commercial, elbows in.

Back to ALLEN rubbing his eyes

INTERIOR - ISLAND - NIGHT
MARIE-NOEL is sitting in the dark, smoking a 
cigarette.


               MARIE-NOEL (V.O.)
     My despair has a strange shape.  It doesn't 
     hurt like something that hurts your body.  
     It's seeing the continuity.....

TITLE: MARIE-NOEL at about the time of the tragic 
loss of her half-sister.

VIEW ON TONY, speaking to MARIE-NOEL.

EXTERIOR - 24HR GAS STATION - NIGHT
MARIE-NOEL is at a loss.  She has exhausted her 
options.


               MARIE-NOEL
     Events slowly unfold with the possibility 
     that my patience will become accidental waste.

VIEW on MARIE-NOEL speaking to TONY.


               MARIE-NOEL
     But at the same time I see that it's exactly 
     what put Mom in the position she was always in.

               TONY
     The first time you feel sexual you see fate 
     all around you? Is that what you want?

               MARIE-NOEL
     Yes, and I really deserve it.

               TONY
     I have the feeling that that's dad's only 
     motive.

EXTERIOR - FRONT YARD OF ALLEN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
ALLEN squints from the bright news camera lights.

               ALLEN
     Not two guys, a girl and a guy.  They were 
     related. Marie-Noel that's her name, not very 
     Greek I know...

               INTERVIEWER
     And she was the one you were married to?

               ALLEN
     Yes.

     I wasn't too young to know what happened the 
     last time we were found out.  You don't act

               INTERVIEWER
     And you were kidnapped by aliens, did you say?

               ALLEN
     No, no, no, no.  I was involved with this woman
     and this guy.

               INTERVIEWER
     Wait, wait, wait, let me understand this... you
     were involved with a goddess?  Like a Greek 
     goddess?

               ALLEN
     With a Greek, Zeus, Athena type goddess.

               INTERVIEWER
     Where is she now?

               ALLEN
     She's like hunting quail in the Sierras now.  
     
               INTERVIEWER     
     What?
          
               ALLEN     
     She left me for dirt.

               INTERVIEWER

     Yeah, we were married right before....

Off Screen. ALLEN and AUGUST (as ARTEMIS) walk into living room. AUGUST leads the way in, glances into the bedroom on the left.
               ALLEN
     Look around. It's a 1 bedroom, 1/2 bath 
     in the hall and full vanity...laundry      
     downstairs. 

               AUGUST 
     Is it quiet? 

               ALLEN
     Very quiet. Where you from? 

August stops in left of frame, turns to ALLEN.


               AUGUST 
     Nashville.
     
               ALLEN     
     First time in LA? 

               AUGUST 
     Yeah, I just got a "Seventeen" cover and 
     everyone said I should come here. 

               ALLEN 
     Where are you staying? 

               AUGUST 
     With my Aunt. 

               ALLEN
     Do you act? 

August approaches the camera. She is wearing 1/2 
moon earrings.


               AUGUST 
     No, just modeling for now. But I've heard about 
     some really great workshops from my agent. 

AUGUST feels satisfied with what she sees as she 
gazes into the bedroom. ALLEN draws closer.
 
               ALLEN 
     I'm an actor. TV commercials, some stage. 
     I know just about everybody in town, free 
     advice, comes with the rent. 

               AUGUST. 
     How much is it? 

               ALLEN 
     Well, the first month's free. You've got 
     to come up with some kind of security deposit, 
     figure one month and then the last month 
     and that comes to half the price published 
     in the ad.

               AUGUST. 
     (No response)

               ALLEN 
     Does that seem like a lot? 

               AUGUST 
     Well for Tennessee standards, but I don't know. 

               ALLEN 
     Do you know why the apartment's only half per 
     month of the going rate for this size apartment 
     in Hollywood? 

               AUGUST.
     No. 

               ALLEN 
     Because I sleep here 1 night a week. 

AUGUST looks at the bedroom, looks in, shocked by 
what she has just heard. She seems confused for a 
moment. She turns and faces ALLEN. ALLEN stares at 
her while blocking the doorway.  She hesitates and 
makes him budge.  ALLEN backs off and August slowly 
walks out of the apartment.  ALLEN is left standing 
alone in the empty apartment.

               VOICE
      TONY, are you there, Tony! Tony! Tony!

...and find TONY at the door looking at the coin. It 
indicates he should go into a Barber shop. TONY 
looks inside the Barber shop and sees threatening 
faces. He enters anyway. Goes up to GUY SELLING SODA
who takes the coin out of TONY's hand and gives him
a soda. TONY is puzzled.

DISSOLVE:

Tony is siting in a chair with a cloth wrapped up to
his neck. The barber looks at TONY'S hair. TONY is 
trying to open the can but can't figure it out.
               

               TONY
     Do you have a church key?
 
Everybody in the barbershop laughs. The barber opens
the soda for him.

     I'll......

Thugs slowly get up from their chairs, dropping

TONY looks around at the 8 mean faces around him.

     I want to cure my passive aggressive 
     personality.  From now on when I want 
     something I'm going to ask for it. 
     I'm going to learn how to be more 
     observant of signs and consider how 
     other people might need clearer signals 
     from me.

     going on with the child. No, no, no, no,
      no no, the couple is stonewalling. Nobody has 
     seen the child, in what, 15 years. 
     Every visit is marked "guardian unavailable".      
     Nobody bothers because it's the island. And 
     get this, the couple, they're not married. No.
     They're the step-children of the owner of

INTERIOR - ISLAND OFFICE - DAY
DAVE, an opposing Attorney, and TOSHI, his assistant,
meet across the table with TONY and his attorney 
DOOLITTLE.


               DOOLITTLE
     The is your meeting so why don't we get down 
     to business. 

               DAVE
     Sounds fine.

               DOOLITTLE
     Call Boston if you want. I don't think the 
     time change will make any difference

Nervous looks among lawyers. TONY is oblivious.


               DAVE
     Your name is Filmore West, correct?

TONY does not answer.


               DOOLITTLE
     We're requesting an environmental impact study 
     on the employment angle in Avalon. 

               DAVE
     Are you kidding?  Any loss in jobs will be 
     absorbed in the Federal tourism franchise. 
     Employment will double, property and leases 
     will increase in value. The overall benefit 
     will be stunning to the average citizen of 
     Avalon.

               DOOLITTLE
     What if we tell everybody about the national      
     resources here. If you'll remember your history      
     gentlemen, the civil war was won by the 
     collateral in the Treasury created by the 
     California gold rush. We think the government
     needs a big hit of cash right now to cure the 
     deficit. Remember what Churchill said, a great 
     government never has to face the truth nor pay 
     cash. 

               DAVE
     Could we have a moment?

DOOLITTLE and TOSHI stand and walk from the table.

INTERIOR - ISLAND OFFICE - DAY
DAVE and TOSHI stand and walk to the corner of the 
room.


                    DAVE
     What if we bring up the legality of him
     impersonating his grandfather. 

               TOSHI
     I think we need something stronger. Any 
     sexual harassment suits or child abuse.

EXTERIOR - AVALON INFORMATION BOOTH - DAY
BRENDA continues to speak with the OFFICER.


               BRENDA
     Did they have a child with them? Or did they 
     take this child with them?

The OFFICER interrupts BRENDA.


               OFFICER
     They're brats. They're very unpopular      
     around here. They're keeping the property      
     values from tripling.

               BRENDA
     Great, where can I find them?

               SHERIDAN
     Probably France. What would you do if you      
     owned all of Catalina and Anacapa..?

     and the IRS are looking for them?

BRENDA's expression changes. She becomes maniacal.

DAVE and TOSHI sit down again, ready with a response.

OPPOSING ATTORNEY hands TONY the documents.


               DAVE
     I'd like to direct your attention to the      
     signatures on these documents.

DOOLITTLE rips the document out of DAVE'S hand. 


                DOOLITTLE
     This is intolerable!

               DAVE
     One is a reconveyence of a second deed of      
     trust, and the other is your recent letter 
     to us. You would have been 4 years old at 
     the time of the first document.

WE HEAR the sound of a small earthquake. ALL PARTIES
loo up and around and it stops.

EXTERIOR - AVALON - DAY
BRENDA is alarmed at the earthquake. She spins, 
disoriented.

INTERIOR - INN ON MT. ADA - DAY
TONY has a knowing look on his face. The earthquake 
is a good sign.


               TONY
     You guys believe in fairy tales don't you?

               DAVE
     We want to know who you are.

               TONY
     This reminds me of the Tempest where the 
     rightful Duke is robbed of his kingdom by 
     his evil brother... 

               TOSHI
     Were you born in this country?

               TONY
     ...and the evil brother puts the good Duke 
     and his daughter out to sea in a small boat 
     to die. And at the end of the story....

               DOOLITTLE
     My client is using a figure of speech.

               DAVE
     Then where are we going with this, guys?

               TONY
     You two are going to jail.

               DOOLITTLE
     We're saying....you don't have enough money.

TONY turns to TOSHI.


               TONY
     What do you say next?

               TOSHI
     We're just representing the United States      
     Government in an attempt to take what the 
     people have a right to.

               TONY
     Big Brother. Orwell! No, no, That's too recent.

               DOOLITTLE
     The situation is irreversible.

DOOLITTLE tries to keep TONY from standing up.


               DAVE
     What are you going to do?  Act it out for us.

TONY heats up.


               TONY
     ...And it's raining and hailing and lightning's      
     striking and you guys think that I'm dead, but 
     I'm not. I'm really back in the big island with 
     my daughter. 

DOOLITTLE puts his hand on TONY'S shoulder to 
restrain him.


               TONY
     And you know what we're doing. Playing chess, 
     and having a picnic!

TONY stands up to leave and crashes into a waiter

     I've been sleeping a lot lately.

               RANCH HAND
     Yeah about 2 years.

The RANCH HAND helps TONY unload supplies from the

     A woman named Reggie Swan confirmed she'll 
     arrive March 4th. She'll be staying until

The RANCH HAND goes back for a second box as TONY 
continues down the dock.


               RANCH HAND
     There have been quite a few fly-overs by 
     the park service.  The last 6 months      
     there has been surf on the North point. 
     Anyone who can afford a boat has been 
     streaming up here like freeway commuters.

               TONY
     Yeah.

               RANCH HAND
     This thing with the surfers has become 
     some sort of a cult. There have been a 
     few entries on the South shore, young men 
     looking for Marie-Noel...I vacated them 
     immediately.

               TONY
     Uh huh.

               RANCH HAND

EUGENE runs away from the house.

INTERIOR - KITCHEN - DAY
Tony sits down and stacks packages of Pop Tarts in
front of him. He opens a package and starts eating 
voraciously. The sheep is standing next to him and 
he strokes it. MARIE-NOEL sits down and starts 
reading the LA TIMES. She looks up.


               MARIE-NOEL
     Why did you let the animals go? Here's      
     a story about animals that caused erosion 
     on the Channel Islands. We don't need any      
     more attention right now.
     
               TONY
     I scattered them for their own      
     protection. And it doesn't bother me      
     because any animal, no matter where it      
     starts, turns out the same. 

TONY eats pop tarts.


               MARIE-NOEL
     Do you remember seeing my moon earrings      
     anywhere have you?

               TONY
     The ones you were wearing the night .....

               MARIE-NOEL
     The night of the great unpleasantness? 

MARIE-NOEL gets up and starts looking for something 
in the kitchen drawer. TONY sees War and Peace on 
the kitchen table.


               TONY
     Is there anything about Halloween in      
     Edgar Allen Poe?

MARIE-NOEL sits up and stops the conversation.

looks at her.


               TONY
     You can stop living out of suitcases and 
     fix the place up?

               MARIE-NOEL
     Oh, and you can go and enjoy your life in
      LA.

               TONY
     What's that supposed to mean?

               MARIE-NOEL
     You get to come and go as you please and 
     I'm stuck here in this dirty hideout.
     
               TONY
     I'm in the same situation you are.      
     Moving or sitting still is the same      
     thing, they're everywhere. 

               MARIE-NOEL
     What about the government?

               TONY
     I think we can stall the government 
      until the next gubernatorial election. 

               MARIE-NOEL
     Forget it.

She thinks about herself and her own dilemma.

MARIE-NOEL starts looking under books. 


               TONY
     If anything happens to me you      
     should take the train East...

TONY points East.


               TONY
     ...We both came from the West. I think      
     we'll be heading that way.

               MARIE-NOEL
     Well, you'll be all set up in LA if      
     anything happens to me.

He pauses and doesn't answer right away.


               TONY
     We've had a good life. We've been lucky. 
     All these extra years are for stories.      
     There's nothing left to do except to see
      how we fit into them.

MARIE-NOEL becomes silent and distracted, digging in
a drawer.


               MARIE-NOEL
     You know, I've looked everywhere. There      
     are no references to two people leaving a       
     Halloween party anywhere in Western, Eastern, 
     Sumerian, or comic book literature.

               TONY
     I thought we were going to drop that.
     
               MARIE-NOEL
     What was your mother's favorite book?

               TONY
     How should I know?

               MARIE-NOEL
     We both should have written these things
      down. That's why I have a diary now.

MARIE-NOEL looks at TONY in the eye.


               TONY
     You'll know what to do when the time      
     comes.

               MARIE-NOEL
     I protest in advance any role where I
      am resolved as ineffective, irrelevant,      
     marginal, unable to influence, yet always
      influenced and, in short, any role where I
      am victimized by circumstance. These are
      my politics and someone's going to have      
     to deal with them. 

               TONY
     Good.

ALLEN asleep on couch. He has gained 50 pounds. 
There are empty beer cans and empty pizza boxes on 
the floor. A WOMAN unlocks the door and we follow 
her into the apartment. She is tired from a business 
trip. She sees ALLEN.


               WOMAN
     What are you doing in my apartment? What      
     are you doing here?

ALLEN wakes up, startled, rubbing his eyes.


               WOMAN
     And who's pizza is this? Excuse me!

               ALLEN
     Calm down. We weren't expecting you for      
     a while, we had the exterminator come in 
     like you requested...

               WOMAN
     Oh you did?

H. TOM appears from the next room, groggy.


               WOMAN
     And who the hell is this?

               ALLEN (aside to H. TOM)
     Take this stuff out for her.

H. TOM starts frantically collecting the garbage.


               WOMAN
     You've got pizza in my place...you're
      lying here. Who's clothes are these?

ALLEN picks up his bag of things. H. TOM finishes 
his cleanup.


               ALLEN
     There's no pizza here; there's no clothes      
     here.

               WOMAN
     You had no permission to come into my      
     place. A guy sleeping in my bedroom,      
     sleeping on my couch.

               ALLEN
     I'm going to request to the board that
      you perhaps should be kicked out for your      
     bad sculpture.

ALLEN and H. TOM exit.


               WOMAN

The WOMAN slams the door and shakes her head in 
amazement.

once over to the house. She is about to begin her 
new life.  Is this it? She walks up the pathway to

growing on the front lawn. She steps over the

     What's that on your face?

ALLEN fingers his unshaven face.


               AUNT DEBBIE
     Did you move that refrigerator to my new      
     building?

               ALLEN

     He picks up my residual checks and he's a      
     really good plumber.

     No ma'am.

               ALLEN
     Shut up! 
     (to AUNT DEBBIE) 
     No we didn't.

               AUNT DEBBIE
     That refrigerator, did you strap it on      
     top of the car?

FLASHBACK:
The stolen car rolls through and intersection with 
the refrigerator strapped to the top.


               ALLEN 
     No!

               AUNT DEBBIE
     And then did you ditch their car?

FLASHBACK:
From above, ALLEN and H. TOM remove the refrigerator
from the top of the rental car.

     No ma'am.  The car was towed...

               ALLEN
     Shut up!

ALLEN pushes H. TOM.


               AUNT DEBBIE
     So you faked homelessness and begged for      
     free chicken.

FLASHBACK:
ALLEN and H. TOM stand at the window of a fast food 
stand faking homelessness. ALLEN has Will Work For 
Food written on his stomach.


               ALLEN
     What are you saying Aunt Debbie?

               AUNT DEBBIE
     The refrigerator is all scraped up and has      
     no freon. And you smell rancid. And why      
     are you so fat!

AUNT DEBBIE exits, ALLEN knows she is not finished 
and counts..

               ALLEN
     One, two, three..

               AUNT DEBBIE
     Your cousin just arrived. When you see
      her, be sociable!

DEBBIE finally exits.


               ALLEN
     You know I've been having these dreams      
     lately where my mother finds me floating
      down the river in a little wicker basket      
     and it turns out that (shouts in the

TONY walks off and walks into a line of workers 
carrying 2x4s. He ducks and almost gets decapitated, takes
refuge at a bus bench. A MUSICIAN is sitting on the

     Yes.

               MUSICIAN 
     What?

               TONY
     Why did you come up just this minute?

               MUSICIAN 
     I'm going to work, man.

               TONY
     Is this the bus you always take?

               MUSICIAN 
     No,  I'm late.

               TONY
     You're late! Why are you late?

               MUSICIAN 
     I overslept, man.

               TONY
     Nothing caused you to be late?

               MUSICIAN 
     I'm just sitting here waiting for 
     the bus. What's the big deal?  Do you      
     have to talk to me?

THE MUSICIAN gets up in frustration and leaves. Tony
exits frame in foreground. A runaway car careens 
into the bench going backwards and destroys the 
bench where they just sat.

     Oh my god!  I can't fucking believe this!
     My car must have popped out of park!  It

     They'd love it.

MUSIC: Bach Suite #2 S. 1008  


               ALLEN
     If they were alive, you know what I'd tell      
     them? I'd tell them I'm a temp in an      
     insurance company.

               H. TOM
     If you assign everything to infantile      
     motives, life becomes boring. Your      
     religion only explains your sex life.

               ALLEN
     You're not listening. I don't want to be      
     poor. But it's not like I'm doing some I 
      gotta starve thing here. If I had enough 
     money I'd be happy.

               H. TOM
     And then again you may be right, for all      
     the wrong reasons. Twenty years in the
      mind is unfortunately not twenty years in      
     the body and it get worse and worse as
      you go.

               ALLEN
     Not me. I keep my nut real low. Basically      
     I live off my relatives. You know?  Free 
     rent. All the chicks I can pluck from my 
     aunt's building. All I need is one national      
     commercial a year and I can live like a      
     king.

               H. TOM
     Things are stranger in other places.

               ALLEN
     Where do you get these things you say,
      man. Are you still on acid?

               H. TOM
     I just say things that come into my head,      
     because they're more enjoyable than my
      own thoughts.

We pull back to reveal ALLEN and H. TOM eating lunch
under a monument to the F-104.

JULIENNE looks up and Aunt DEBBIE passes in front of
her.


               JULIENNE
     There's two choices for me right now.       
     I'm either pregnant or feeling a false      
     pregnancy.  The first one is impossible.

               AUNT DEBBIE
     Are you trying to tell your mother that      
     you're knocked up?

               JULIENNE
     Incredible weather we're having.

               AUNT DEBBIE
     I hate it because it makes my skin dry,      
     especially my private parts.

               JULIENNE
     In Maine, it's been frozen for two months.

               AUNT DEBBIE
     Why are you here anyway?

               JULIENNE
     To take care of you. I thought that giving 
     it all up and taking care of my old
      mother would be the simplest life      
     possible. What you're telling me about my      
     cousin Allen is upsetting. 

               AUNT DEBBIE     
     Criminy....You sure feel sorry for      
     yourself.

               JULIENNE      
     Damn right! I didn't come here to get
      drawn into slum-lording. What did you
      get into mom? 

AUNT DEBBIE likes to change the subject mid sentence,
and wander freely the world of denigration.


               AUNT DEBBIE
     My dear husband, bless his soul THE      
     BASTARD.(with a twinkle in her eye) He
      was very good to me..

               JULIENNE
     You always said that.....

               AUNT DEBBIE
     It was my idea, not his! Now you're      
     cousin Allen is the bastard.

               JULIENNE
     Look mom, I came out here because I      
     needed to. I've went through a time with      
     so many regrets. I got ostentatious and      
     solemn and I hated myself, and anyone who 
     behaved the same way.  Independence works 
     better alone. I'm a girl Shane, you know 
     the gunfighter who hung up his guns.

               AUNT DEBBIE
     You didn't give them enough sex, that's
      your own fault. 

               JULIENNE
     Too many people in my past have been
      hurt, and all of them named Tony.
     
               AUNT DEBBIE
     Have you seen all these mushrooms around      
     the house?

               JULIENNE
     Fato Profungus... I believe they're called. 

               AUNT DEBBIE
      You would know that. But don't eat them.      
     Mrs. Johnson up the street says they
      make you horny. And when are you going to      
     learn to drive?

               JULIENNE
     Probably never. I like walking.

               MORTICIAN
     And what qualifies you for this job?

               TONY
     Well, what is the job?

               MORTICIAN
     State privacy laws require that we watch over
     our guests day and night from the minute they 
     arrive to the day of the funeral.

               TONY
     You mean the bodies?

               MORTICIAN
     Yes. You're the body watcher.

               TONY
     Oh. The body watcher.

               MORTICIAN
     Well, do you have any questions?

               TONY
     Oh, no.

               MORTICIAN
     I have a few questions, if you don't mind. 

               TONY
     Okay.

               MORTICIAN     
     For example, why do you want this job?

               TONY 
     I want to meet people.

               MORTICIAN     
     Dead people?

               TONY
     No, no. If I work at night I'll meet people 
     during the day. See, I don't sleep much at 
     night.

               MORTICIAN
     You have two lives? I have two lives. I've 
     always wanted to be a stand up comic. Do 
     you mind if I show you some of my material?

               TONY
     Go ahead.

               MORTICIAN
     A man says to his doctor he can't remember 
     things from one minute to the next the 
     doctor says, "How long has this been going 
     on?" The man says, "How long has what been

INTERIOR - MORGUE - NIGHT
TONY reads. 

MUSIC: "Frascilita" from Lisa Germano "Geek the

Several angles. TIME PASSES.

VIEW ON CLOCK 12 Midnight. 2 AM. 4 AM.
TONY puts down the book and opens a refrigerator 
door and slides out a body. The body is in a bag. 
He lifts the body onto a cart and rolls it under a 
light. He zips open the bag and looks inside. He 
raises a pale arm of the dead person and the arm 
slowly falls out of frame. TONY looks for a knife on
the work table and looks at the first knife, it is 
too small. The picks up a second knife, it is too 
large. He reaches for a third knife, just right. He 
takes a deep breath and starts sawing open the dead 
body. 

EXTERIOR - MORTUARY - NIGHT
The MORTICIAN hurries to the door of the MORTUARY 
having forgotten something at work.

INTERIOR - MORGUE - NIGHT
When he has the stomach open he puts down the knife 
and scoops up the entrails of the dead body with 
two hands and holds them up in front of the camera. 
He saws the entrails loose and throws them on to the
floor.

The entrails splatter on the cold tiles. TONY kneels 
over to examine them. 

VIEW on door.
The Mortician comes through the door, sees what TONY 
is doing and is shocked. 

MUSIC STOPS

               MORTICIAN
     What are you doing?  You depraved person!
     Is that a client?  Get out of here!

               TONY
     Number 12.

               MORTICIAN
     Mr. Peterson?

               TONY
     I dunno...Not yet. I see something here!

               MORTICIAN
     I don't care what you see. Get out.

TONY Leaves. The MORTICIAN looks at the mess, 
horrified.


EXTERIOR - THE VALLEY - NIGHT
JULIENNE walks past a drug store and decides to go 
in.

SOURCE MUSIC: "Green Tambourine" the Lemon Pipers

INTERIOR - PHARMACY - NIGHT
PAN is reading a pornographic magazine. He is tapped
on the shoulder by HERMES, a young man with a light 
beard. 


               PAN
     Oh hi.

               HERMES
     We need to talk.

               PAN
     OK.

JULIENNE enters the frame and starts up an aisle.

IN ANOTHER PART OF THE STORE:


               PAN
     I've been living quietly by myself,      
     except for the moon-light orgies and me      
     scoring twice a day. 

               HERMES
     Dad wants to talk to you...because you're      
     family.

               PAN
     Hermes, I'll pay you if you get me back      
     into the organization. I've got this new      
     pornography you have to see...

HERMES directs PAN'S attention toward TONY, who 
appears behind them. TONY heads down the same aisle 
as JULIENNE. HERMES smiles.

VIEW ON TONY


               PAN
     His mother was Jefferson's mistress. 
     
               HERMES
     We should help him.

               PAN
     No.

EROS, a small child with a toy bow and arrow, shoots
an arrow at JULIENNE. It hits her and she picks it 
up. She looks around and does not see where it came 
from. 


               PAN
     He lives on my island. There will always
      be as many demigods as there are minor      
     poets. There are too many of them. They      
     have good lives. They don't need any      
     help. 

TONY approaches JULIENNE. JULIENNE approaches TONY.  She sees TONY and smiles.


               JULIENNE
     God I have a headache. Do you know the      
     best thing for headaches?     

               TONY
     Is that why you came here just now?

               JULIENNE
     ...most people go to the vegetable section,
      I come here because I believe in      
     headaches....Men who are worth anything      
     always have headaches..

JULIENNE pauses, a little embarrassed. A WOMAN comes
up behind them but does not pay any attention to 
them.
          

               TONY
     I walk to get rid of my headaches....

               JULIENNE
     I thought so. Everything's OK here as      
     long as you're name isn't Tony. 

               TONY
     OK.

     Should we screw things up?

VIEW on TONY and JULIENNE

     
               JULIENNE
     It's a challenge life put before me      
     overcoming my Tony Karma.
     Men want blonds and good breasts. Women      
     with breasts always do well. They also
      like tomboys. They trust tomboys. They      
     consider them honorable and would never 
     have sex with them unless the tomboy asked? 

VIEW on PAN and HERMES


               HERMES
     No, don't.

PAN yells at the top of his lungs. HERMES is thrown 
backward into a closet.

     There's gas leaking. Get out.

TONY starts to run out of the store pulling JULIENNE 
by the hand. He looks back and sees a FRAIL OLD 
WOMAN who does not understand the danger. TONY wants
to go back.


               TONY
          (to JULIENNE)
     I'll meet you outside.

TONY goes back to help the old WOMAN.


               TONY
     Come on. there's a gas leak.

TONY tries to pull her.

He stops at a corner, shakes the can, and starts 
spraying silly string into the street. As he does 
this, WE HEAR: a car alarm go off across the street. 
WE SEE a black range rover. TONY raises the can to 
spray again and sprays. The can emits a squiggly 
spray and the sound from the car across the street 
matches the silly string's oscillations. TONY puts 
the can down in astonishment.

TONY looks at the book then EUGENE finds a cigarette.
The lighter won't light. The man realizes he is 
imposing on TONY and tries to get the book back 
while holding the cigarette in his hand. EUGENE 
gives TONY the lighter and takes back the book. 
The priority is his smoking triumphs and TONY ends 
up lighting him up. The lighter shoots up in a big

               BARRY
     See you Allen. Aren't you going in the actor's      
     entrance?

               ALLEN
     They always bring us in the back door here 
     but I'm going in the front today.

INTERIOR - LOBBY - DAY
ALLEN and BARRY enter the lobby of the building.
          
               ALLEN
     You know I've added up all the time my      
     commercials have run on television and I'm      
     already way done with my 15 minutes of fame.

ALLEN starts to get into the elevator.

               BARRY
     Should I take that personally?

               ALLEN
     Take it how ever you'd like.

               BARRY
     You know what? I'm going to take the steps. 
     I don't feel comfortable in this elevator.

               ALLEN
     Is this about me?

               BARRY
     No. I just don't like elevators. You know 
     what and elevator is. It's a coffin. If it 
     ever stops. Did you know that? The cables 
     are weak, and it stops, there's no air.

               ALLEN
     Barry!

               BARRY
     If there was an earthquake you know what would      
     happen?

               ALLEN
     Barry!

               BARRY
     ...you'd be dead.     

               ALLEN
     Barry!

               BARRY
     I'd rather walk and have thighs.

               ALLEN
     Barry!

ALLEN finally interrupts him and hands him back the
Pepsi.

               ALLEN
     I'll call you at the office later. Oh oh oh! 
     I'm scared.

THE ELEVATOR DOOR closes.

INTERIOR - ELEVATOR - DAY

ALLEN teases BARRY one more time. ALLEN opens the 
elevator door...

               ALLEN
     Oh Barry, I almost forgot...

...and TONY standing at the door waiting to get in. 
TONY enters and settles in for the ride. 

               ALLEN
     You're a pussy Barry. 
          (to TONY) 
     Casting?

               TONY
     Sure.

ALLEN reacts to TONY'S lack of determination. The 
elevator starts to rise.

EFFECT: EARTHQUAKE
          
               ALLEN     
     Oh my god it's a earthquake.  

               TONY
     It's all right.

               ALLEN
     BARRY!!!!

               TONY
     It'll be over soon.

               ALLEN
     Are we under anything structural? Get in a 
     door jam.

ALLEN huddles next to TONY in the elevator door and 
the shaking increases.

               ALLEN
     Do you smell gas?

The lights go on and off in the middle of the tumult. 

               TONY
     What?

               ALLEN
     We're going to die. Barrrrrrry!

               ANNOUNCER MONTAGE (v.o.)
     6.6 officially if you have been sleeping all      
     morning. 6.6 it was felt from San Diego to Las      
     Vegas to Modesto. It was centered exactly under 
     in Northridge and it is a unnamed fault...We 
     are in Granada Hills and the power is still 
     out...Sadly there were three deaths reported 
     in the Santa Clarita Valley area. The force 
     blew out storefront windows, there were 
     landslides in Pacific Palisades left cars 
     caked in mud. Ruptured gas lines buckled      
     the roads. The Santa Monica freeway collapsed 
     near La Cieniega. An apartment complex on 
     14th and Idaho exploded. One house toppled 
     down a hill.

      ...until the sun came up. And then we went off 
     to our room to see if there was any damage, it 
     was pretty bad. It was quiet, there wasn't 
     anybody driving, there were people just 
     wandering around, you know we walked out and 
     we looked and we saw the cracks..... and you 
     know down the street over here beside the 
     building was off, a big bell tower up the 
     street was tilted halfway down, it was sort of      
     scary......

               ALLEN 
     I've go to check my building. I've got to 
     turn the gas off. We don't have any 
     earthquake kits. Where's your car?
     
               TONY

     more than any thing that's ever happened to me.  
     She had favorites of course.

     now.

               DERANGED WOMAN

               TONY
     Loser. You're such a loser. You have 
     terrible taste in clothes! All your taste 
     is in your friggin' mouth!

The woman flees. ALLEN is amazed. 

               ALLEN
     What are you doing?

               TONY
     You don't want to have anything to do with 
     her.

               ALLEN
     I beg to differ. Is that tricycle listed. 
     This never happens to me during the day.

things out. One of them holds a ZEBRA HEAD. JULIENNE
comes from a storage room. She is holding a nice 
lamp and a box of pictures.  JULIENNE forgets 
something and goes back. A picture drops on the 
floor. It is a picture of ALLEN and JULIENNE and 
AUNT DEBBIE 

INTERIOR - ALLEN'S BUILDING - DAY
ALLEN and TONY enter the building. They work their 
way through the crowd in the hall toward ALLEN'S 
APARTMENT. The tenants hold personal items. They are
angry at ALLEN.

               ALLEN
     Why are you moving out?

               FLEEING TENANT
     This place is condemned. No use of paying 
     you any more rent.

               ALLEN
     Don't think you're going to get your security
      deposit back.

ALLEN stops at his door and tries to open it.  It 
won't budge. TONY hears something upstairs and 
starts up the stairs. The group with the ZEBRA HEAD 
passes him coming down the stairs. 

               VOICE
     Watch out for the floor up there, it's weak.

               TONY     
     OK.

TONY and JULIENNE meet at the top of the stairs. 
JULIENNE is visibly prettier.

               JULIENNE
     I thought you were dead?

               TONY 
     I survived.

               JULIENNE
     We have to start meeting like this.

Charming look form TONY. His eyes lock with 
JULIENNE's. She leans over for a kiss. THE CAMERA 
moves toward him. Tony steps forward to kiss and 
SUDDENLY.... TONY falls straight down out of frame.

TONY turns and falls into a room. He ends up in a 
dusty room. He looks up, unable to get out, he 
slowly drifts into a trance.

VIEW ON ALLEN'S APARTMENT
ALLEN forces open the door to his apartment and sees
that everything is on the floor and broken. He picks
up his COAT and a few valuables and leaves. ALLEN 
comes back out looking for TONY. ALLEN sees JULIENNE.

                ALLEN
     What are you doing here?

               JULIENNE
     Someone's fallen in the floor upstairs.

                ALLEN
     Don't worry about it..Just a dead beat. 
     We have to get out of here there's going 
     be an aftershock.

ALLEN hurries her out of the building. There is an 
aftershock. We hear SCREAMS.

               JIM

               TONY
