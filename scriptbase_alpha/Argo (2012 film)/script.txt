          The familiar logo WARNER BROS. PRESENTS COMES UP.
          After a beat, it is consumed by FIRE.
          It becomes AN AMERICAN FLAG, BURNING in the street.

          1 EXT. U.S. EMBASSY (TEHRAN) - MORNING 1

          Effigies of Jimmy Carter and the deposed Shah -- crowds
          chanting Magbar Carter! Magbar Ahmrika!� Fists in the
          air.

          SUPERIMPOSE: TEHRAN - NOVEMBER 4, 1979
          YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN -- about 2/3 men and 1/3 women, some
          with flak jackets; about half the young women wear full
          chador. Many wear plastic bibs with photographs of
          Ayatollah Khomeini.
          PASTED TO ROOSEVELT GATE: photographs of STUDENTS who
          were killed under the deposed Shah of Iran's regime.
          Signs in English: U.S.A. RETURN THE SHAH� -- JUSTICE
          FOR MURDER.� A few IRANIAN POLICE attend -- more as
          bystanders than peacekeepers.
          A MAN frantically stabs an EFFIGY of the SHAH.
          An IRANIAN STUDENT films the scene with a Super 8 camera.

          2 EXT. EMBASSY GROUNDS - MORNING 2

          From INSIDE THE EMBASSY GATES we can hear the noise of
          the protest. There are three primary buildings on
          campus: the CHANCERY, the embassy's main building, THE
          AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE, and the CONSULATE.
          We can see that the compound is securitized: sand-filled
          traps and steel bars on the windows of the consulate.

          3 INT. U.S. EMBASSY - CONSULATE OFFICE - MORNING 3

          Now, we see the POV THROUGH those steel bars.
          Standing on a chair looking at the protest outside the
          gate, is BOB ANDERS, late 40s-50s, a consular officer.

          Carnival's bigger today.
          MARK LIJEK, 29, a consular officer, joins Anders at the
          window.

          4 EXT. ROOSEVELT GATE - MORNING 4

          Then, in a famous piece of archive footage, something
          simple happens. A YOUNG MAN IN A SWEATER climbs the gate
          and makes it to the other side.
          And now, we see the REVERSE of that famous shot. This
          isn't archive footage anymore.
          We're looking at the POV of TOM AHERN, 48, the CIA
          station chief here.

          5 INT. MARINE GUARD POST - MORNING 5

          From a pillbox on the embassy campus, SGT. ROCKY
          SICKMANN, a young MARINE, can also see the protestors
          break across the lawn.

          MARINE SGT. SICKMANN
          (into his radio)
          ... Fort Apache is breached -- 
          please advise --

          6 EXT. ROOSEVELT GATE - MORNING 6

          The PROTEST in front of the gate is getting rowdier --
          its energy and numbers swelling.
          A group of STUDENTS -- these more brisk, organized, all
          bearded and dressed in flak jackets -- push their way to
          the front of the protest --
          WOMEN raise a banner. It's a signal.
          As if on cue, the IRANIAN POLICE move from the gates. A
          WOMAN removes a large pair of bolt cutters from
          underneath her chador -- hands them to a BEARDED STUDENT
          -- who gets to work on the CHAINS holding the gate

                         CLOSED --
          When one YOUNG MAN wearing a green military field jacket
          raises his fist, we can see that he has a concealed
          PISTOL in his clothes.
          More STUDENTS climbing the wall -- dropping the 12 feet
          to the other side, one after another.

          THEY'RE COMING OVER THE WALLS --

          8 EXT. ROOSEVELT GATE - MORNING 8

          But a moment later no more climbing is required, because
          the GATE CHAIN IS CUT and protestors FLOOD through the
          embassy gates, a human dam breaking --

          9 INT. CHANCERY OFFICE - MORNING 9

          Mounting chaos in here, the nerve center of the embassy.
          Everyone on a different phone. It's like an emergency
          room where the patient is the whole building.
          ANN SWIFT, 31, Deputy Political Officer, has the phone by
          her ear -- trying to hear reports from D.C.

                         ANN SWIFT
          There are hundreds of people out

                         THERE --

           No, thousands... There are 

                          THOUSANDS -- 

          10 IN THE CONSULATE OFFICE - MORNING 10
          Mark Lijek and Bob Anders look out windows, nervous, but
          not like the Iranian VISA APPLICANTS who are close to
          panic.

                         BOB ANDERS
          Are these supposed to be 
          bulletproof?

                         MARK LIJEK
          Well, they've never been tested.

          11 INT. CHANCERY (MARINE POST ONE) - MORNING 11

          Six MARINES watch images from closed-circuit television
          cameras on chunky 1970's monitors. Crowds of protestors
          from every part of the embassy campus.
          AL GOLACINSKI, 30, chief of security for the embassy,
          shouts into a radio.

          PROTESTORS come running, turning the corner to reach the
          building. They use bats and crowbars to smash the
          windows of the building.

          13 INT. CONSULATE OFFICE - MORNING 13


                         BOB ANDERS

          Can we get some fucking police
          please?

          14 INT. MARINE POST ONE - MORNING 14

          One by one, the security monitors are going black -- or
          smashed. The Marines stare.

          15 EXT. TALEGHANI AVE. - MORNING 15

          An IRANIAN POLICE CAPTAIN smokes a cigarette, watching
          the mayhem, impassive.

          16 INT. MARINE POST ONE - MORNING 16

           MARINES are putting on armor, gas masks, riot gear. AL
           GOLACINSKI gs down the line reminding them of protocol.

                          AL GOLACINSKI
           Don't shoot. You don't want to be 
           the sonofabitch who started a war -

          every one of us in here.

          A WOMAN IN A CHADOR uses her own radio.
          Some of them ring around the building, holding hands and
          chanting. Some carry AUTOMATIC WEAPONS openly.

           Gallegos and Sickmann hear Golacinski's admonition, but
           PUMP TEAR GAS out a window onto protestors below despite
           it. One cannister after another.

           Now the five in the consulate are joined by LEE SCHATZ,

          Chambers leads Mendez into his makeup studio and starts
          to open windows. Around the studio: stunt double-masks,
          deformed monster foreheads, dental implants on shelves.
          Planet of the Apes prosthetics. Mr. Spock ears on
          Styrofoam stands. (Chambers created all these --
          really.)

                         MENDEZ
          What are you shooting?

                         CHAMBERS
          A monster movie.

                         MENDEZ
          Any good?

                         CHAMBERS
          The target audience will hate it.

                         MENDEZ
          Who's the target audience?

                         CHAMBERS
          People with eyes. Talk to me.

                         MENDEZ
          It's an exfil.

                         CHAMBERS
          From where?

                         MENDEZ

          Mendez picks up a Newsweek magazine under a can of Tab on
          a makeup table: blindfolded Iran hostages on the cover.
          Chambers takes it in for a moment -- the gravity of it.

                         CHAMBERS
          How you getting in the embassy?

                         MENDEZ
          Six got away. They're hiding in
          the city. I'm going over to get
          them.

                         CHAMBERS
          What am I making?

                         MENDEZ
          I need you to help me make a fake
          movie.

                         CHAMBERS
          You've come to the right place. 

                         MENDEZ
          I need to set up a production
          company and build a cover around
          making a movie.

                         CHAMBERS
          That we're not going to make.

                         MENDEZ
          No.

                         CHAMBERS
          You want to go around Hollywood
          acting like you're an important
          person in the movie business.

                         MENDEZ
          That's right.

                         CHAMBERS
          But you don't want to actually do
          anything.

                         MENDEZ
          No.

                         CHAMBERS
          You'll fit right in.

          A couple of empty highball glasses on the table.
          Chambers is looking at PHOTOGRAPHS of the SIX. Mendez is
          taking notes. On a photo of Cora Lijek.

                         CHAMBERS
          This one's got an M.A. in English.
          She should be your screenwriter.
          Sometimes they go on scouts ˜cause
          they want the free meals.
          (re: Bob Anders)
          This guy's the director.

                         MENDEZ
          Can you teach a guy how to be a
          director in a day?

                         CHAMBERS
          You can teach a rhesus monkey to
          be a director in a day. Look, if
          you're gonna do it, you've got to
          do it. The Khomaniacs are fruit
          loops, but they have cousins
          selling eight tracks and prayer
          rugs on La Brea. You can't build 
          cover stories around a movie that
          dsn't exist. You need a script. 
          You need a producer.

                         MENDEZ
          I'm the producer.

                         CHAMBERS
          No, you're not. ˜Associate' at
          best. If it's a twenty-million
          dollar Star Wars rip-off, you need

                         CHAMBERS
          Somebody respectable. With

          And there's LESTER SIEGEL, a semi-legendary producer in
          his semi-legendary seventies. He's equal parts bookie
          and rabbi. His father sold perfume on the Lower East
          Side. Lester is halfway to dressed in a tuxedo.

                         SIEGEL

                         (SHAKES HANDS)

          Aaah, I'd rather stay home and
          count the wrinkles on my dog's
          balls. These fuckin' things are
          like getting measured for your

           SIEGEL (O.S.)
          A little experiment. You be me
          hearing you.
          The TV we're watching sits in a room with a couple of
          Golden Globes and pictures of a younger Lester.

          ON TV, a wild-eyed woman in the crowd (in one of the most

          the Army, we did suicide missions
          that had better odds. So lemme
          hit it again for the cheap seats:

          Siegel looks at the TV: at that moment, a HOSTAGE TAKER 
          holding up photos of hostages for CAMERAS in front of
          him. He takes a beat.

                         SIEGEL

          up The Horses of Achilles script in a William Morris
          binder. Stacks of scripts on a table outside. Siegel's
          new A.F.I. award is being used as a coaster.

          the trades. MGM just capitalized
          for six new films and they're
          desperate for Sci-Fi. They've
          already offered me four times what
          you are.

          But see -- it worries me, what you
          said, and I'll tell you why. A
          couple weeks back I was sitting in
          Trader Vic's enjoying a Mai Tai
          when my pal Warren Beatty came to
          wish me well and we had a little
          chat. Seems he was attached to
          star in Zulu Empire -- which was
          gonna anchor that MGM slate -- but
          Warren confided in me that the
          picture's gone over-budget ˜cause
          the Zulu extras wanna unionize.

          They may be cannibals swallowing
          each other up but they want health
          and dental, so the movie's kaput --

          gonna happen and your script ain't
          worth the buffalo-shit on a

          The way this looks to me --
          through the cataracts, I grant you
          -- is that you can either sign

          your toilet-paper script -- or you

          The feeling here is dangerous. Young men carrying
          automatic weapons casually.
          Behrouz stands next to ALI KHALKALI, 30s, a Revolutionary

          We see the FAMOUS PICTURES OF THE HOSTAGES BEING MARCHED

          DOWN THE STEPS.

          197A INT. KOMITEH HEADQUARTERS STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION 197A

          A Kafka-esque stairway. We see a YOUNG KOMITEH call up
          from the bottom and head up the stairs.
          JUMP CUT TO: one flight to go.

          The Houseguests are gathered in the office. Cora hands
          the telefax to Bob Anders. J Stafford, looking on.

                         CORA LIJEK
          You said ˜a day to learn your
          covers then straight to the

          today, we fly out tomorrow.
          Silent assent among the group. Then J Stafford,
          sitting with his wife, speaks up --

                         J STAFFORD
          We won't do it.

                         MARK LIJEK
          He told them there were six of us.
          They're expecting six. 

                         J STAFFORD

                         (TO MENDEZ)
          You are about to show the only

          they don't know we're here.

                         MENDEZ
          I'm asking you to trust me.

                         J STAFFORD

          What's the alternative? This is

          This one.
          She gives Bob Anders a Canadian maple leaf lapel pin,
          which he affixes to his shirt. Cora Lijek paints lighter
          hair dye onto her hair. The Houseguests are making
          subtle efforts to disguise themselves.

                         CORA LIJEK
          (at a mirror, quoting

          So don't be recognizable, but look

                         MARK LIJEK
          Not that picture. You won't want
          to scare them.
          A nervous smile. Trying to deal with anxiety.
          J and Kathy Stafford look to each other. Sitting
          reading newspapers while the other Houseguests prep for
          the scout. The PHONE starts ringing.

                         PAT TAYLOR
          (answering the phone)
          Hello?
          A cloud comes over Pat as she listens.

                         PAT TAYLOR
          No, there's no one like that here.
          She hangs up the phone fast, as if it were hot to the
          touch.

                         BOB ANDERS

          202 INT. SHERATON ROOM - DAY 202

          Tony getting dressed. Thinking.
          He gets up and leaves, and we start to hear the sound of
          a man talking fast in Farsi.

          203 EXT. CAR RENTAL - DAY 203

          It's a CAR RENTAL MAN, 60s, speaking. Tony is looking at
          a MINIVAN on a lot of beaten-up rental cars.

                         MENDEZ
          This one, how much? One day, how
          much?

          204 INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - DAY 204

          Four of the Houseguests are waiting on the couch, dressed
          in their best approximation of the clothes of a movie
          scout crew. Cora has the maple leaf flag pin on her
          shirt.
          They turn when they see Tony come in the door.
           Tony as he steps down into the living room, down the hall

          play along today, I will get you

          206 INT. MINIVAN - DAY 206

          Mendez, in the driver's seat, looks at the house, then at
          his watch. He starts up the van, filled with four of the
          Houseguests.
          Then he looks in the rearview and sees one of the back
          doors open. J and Kathy Stafford board.

          207 EXT. TEHRAN - DAY 207

          Tony drives the minivan through streets of Tehran. The
          Houseguests sit in silence, looking out the windows.
          There is a vehement DEMONSTRATION going on -- stars-and-
          stripes burning in Molavi Square -- and it's taking place
          right in their way.
          They stop at the demonstration, then realize people
          aren't passing by as much as celebrating in the street.
          Tony is forced to nose his way through the crowd --
          chanting and yelling -- some SLAPPING THE WINDOWS.
          They finally get through and pull away. With the
          demonstration receding behind them, Tony tries to regain
          their focus.

                         MENDEZ
          Tell me who you are.
          This recalls attention from the windows.

          The minivan double-parks on Musavi Street. Taxis, men
          loading and unloading rolled-up carpets onto pickup
          trucks, chaos.
          A YOUNG MAN IN SUIT WITH NO TIE waits. This is REZA, mid-
          20s, a low-level administrator in the Ministry of
          Guidance.
          Mendez gets out and they speak and shake hands. The
          image FREEZES. In a BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPH.
          They exchange pleasantries and Reza leads them down a
          narrow street toward the bazaar.

          209 EXT./INT. TEHRAN BAZAAR - DAY 209

          Reza is leading Mendez and the group of Houseguests
          through the Tehran Bazaar. A word about the place: the
          world's largest bazaar. 10 kilometers of narrow alleys.
          Chinese-made Swiss watches, banks, mosques, butchers,
          fabric stores, gold stands. Boys with hand-trucks loaded
          down with piles of fabric cut through the crowd. Older
          Islamic architecture elbows up against neon signs and
          rickety wooden stands with second-story balconies like
          Bourbon Street.
          Bob Anders walks toward the front.

          Reza leads Mendez and the Houseguests deeper into this
          city within a city; fundamentalist ground zero. BAZAARIS
          stand at their shop doors; puzzled; unfriendly; watching
          the visitors.
          Kathy Stafford, the production designer on the scout,
          takes a Polaroid of a window adorned in gold. The
          SHOPKEEPER, a 70-ish bazaari, sees her do so.
          He hurries out of his store, speaking in rapid-fire Farsi
          at her. The Houseguests stop. Reza speaks to the
          Shopkeeper.

          Sahar calmly closes the door.
          After she ds, she lets the facade go. All of a sudden
          scared. Maybe she tears up. Either way, it's clear she

          The aftermath. The Houseguests, badly shaken, come

          Ken Taylor comes up next to Mendez and, for once,

          (quiet, fast, clear)
          Joint Chiefs are planning a

          Tony comes out to the balcony with a hotel ice bucket in
          one hand and the Canadian passports in the other. He
          puts the passports in the bucket, LIGHTS A MATCH.
          He looks down at the match, at the passports. The first
          stirring of the morning calls-to-prayer echo in the
          distance.
          HOLD for a long beat ON Tony. Thinking.
          Then, HE BLOWS OUT THE MATCH.

          236 INT. O'DONNELL'S OFFICE - NIGHT 236

          O'Donnell is packing up for the night. Paper towels sit
          on top of the coffee spill on his rug.
          His phone rings. He picks up.

                         O'DONNELL

          O'Donnell, thinking. Looking at the phone. Then, with a

          Rushing out of his office, into --

          239 INT. CIA - THE PIT - NIGHT 239

          -- where he catches ALAN SOSA, 50s, head of the
          Directorate of Support -- the CIA's chief financial

                         SOSA
          I can't do it. It's backstopped
          pending Executive Branch GO.

                         O'DONNELL
          What the fuck ds that mean?

                         SOSA
          Carter's got to say yes for us to

          Pat Taylor comes to answer an insistent knocking on her

           She's shocked to see him. Ken Taylor now appears behind 
          Pat. In the hall behind him: The Houseguests are
          assembled, waiting to go. They look their parts -- or,
          much more so than they did on the scout. Cora Lijek has
          darker hair. The Staffords look on, fully dressed.

          Ken Taylor nods. Mendez shakes his hand.

          Mendez gets into the driver's seat. Lee Schatz on the
          passenger side.
          We see Ken's black embassy sedan waiting, driven by a

          PAKISTANI DRIVER.

          Khalkali comes upon a diplomatic photograph of a man with
          glasses.
          He starts to leaf through the photographs from the
          bazaar.

                         KHALKALI --
          looks at the black and white still of Mark Lijek,
          compares it to his diplomatic picture, the first portrait
          we saw of Mark toward the beginning of the film. MATCH.
          Khalkali stands up. SHOUTS in Farsi to another Komiteh --

          265 INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT - SECOND CHECKPOINT - MORNING 265

          Bob Anders stands in front of a rough-voiced IMMIGRATION
          OFFICER. He's holding Bob Anders' YELLOW IMMIGRATION
          FORM and leafing through a file of hundreds of WHITE
          IMMIGRATION FORMS, the duplicates. Without success.

                         IMMIGRATION OFFICER #2
          (in Farsi; to Officer
          #1, re: his own

                         WHITE PILE)
          Nothing.

                         IMMIGRATION OFFICER
          (to Bob Anders)
          When did you say you arrived in
          Iran?

                         BOB ANDERS
          Two days ago.

                         IMMIGRATION OFFICER
          What was the purpose of your
          visit?

                         BOB ANDERS
          We were looking at locations to
          make a film. I'm the director.
          Immigration Officer pauses and looks up. Looks at the
          six other faces. He looks every bit as confrontational
          as Tony acted in rehearsal.

                         BOB ANDERS

                         (VERY CALM)
          We have a letter from the Minister
          of Culture ... 
          The Immigration Officer gestures for the letter. Bob
          takes the letter inviting them on their location scout
          out of a folder. Tony, barely perceptibly, nods.

          266 INT. KOMITEH HQ - MORNING 266

          Khalkali is now speaking with MORADI, an older Komiteh
          official. They speak Farsi and it's untranslated, but we
          get it. He is showing the photograph of Mark Lijek from
          the bazaar and comparing it to the U.S. diplomatic
          photograph.
          Moradi picks up the phone as Khalkali heads out.

          Immigration Officer is conferring with Immigration
          Officer #2 as they look at the letter from the Minister
          of Culture. The Houseguests and Mendez wait.
          Finally, Immigration Officer #2 shrugs.

                         IMMIGRATION OFFICER
          Okay -- Yes -- Okay --
          He waves them through. Second checkpoint done.

          268 INT. CIA - THE PIT - NIGHT 268

          Malinov, a phone to his ear. Ringing.

                         MALINOV
          C'mon c'mon c'mon --

          269 INT. ARGO PRODUCTION OFFICE - NIGHT 269

          The phone in the office rings. No one is there.

          270 EXT. WARNER BROS. STUDIOS - NIGHT 270

           Siegel and Chambers are walking back to the Argo office.
           They are within sight of the Argo bungalow, but a P.A. 
           steps in front of them.

           P.A.
          (a stage whisper)
          I'm sorry, we're shooting.
          He motions for them to wait. A movie -- it looks like a
          police procedural -- is shooting on the lot between them
          and the office.

          271 INT. AIRPORT GATE - MORNING 271


          ANNOUNCEMENT (V.O.)
          Swissair announces general
          boarding for Flight 363 to Zurich.
          Passengers, mostly European businessmen, get up and
          approach the gate.

          272 INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT - THIRD CHECKPOINT - MORNING 272

          Mendez checks in with the Houseguests with his eyes.
          They are now in sight of the airport gates. And here are
          six Komiteh. Young men -- none more than 33 or so --
          holding automatic weapons.
          They have created their own checkpoint. It looks recent,

          A SCREENED-OFF AREA WITH TABLES.

                         KOMITEH #1
          Passports.
          He looks at the Canadian passports and then almost
          immediately speaks.

                         KOMITEH #1
          You come.
          He directs Mendez and the Houseguests into the screened-
          off area. Speaks in Farsi to another Komiteh.

          273 INT. CIA - THE PIT - NIGHT 273


                         LAMONT

          Purser's telling Swissair they're
          not on the plane.

                         O'DONNELL
          They should have boarded already.

                         MALINOV
          (on another phone)
          Still no answer in L.A.

                          MARK LIJEK
           A film.
          Mark mimes turning the rotor of a movie camera. Komiteh
          #1 dsn't understand.

          AZIZI (O.S.)
          Sit down.
          A young man with a beard -- AZIZI, late 20s -- arriving
          on the scene, speaking in Farsi to the others and then in
          very good American English. He looks at the six and the
          face he singles out is J Stafford's.

          You. You had no business in Iran.
          He motions for J STAFFORD to step forward. Mendez
          shifts. A tense moment.

                         J STAFFORD

                         (FARSI) 
          We did. We were preparing to make
          a movie here, sir.

                         AZIZI

                         (FARSI) 
          You don't have journalist visas.

                         (FARSI) 
          Not a documentary. A movie.
          J Stafford reaches into his pocket and gives Azizi a
          copy of the Argo Variety ad.

                         J STAFFORD

                         (FARSI) 
          You see?
          (to Mendez; English) 
          Kevin, where's your briefcase?
          A beat on Mendez. Who then opens his accordion folder
          and takes from it the ARGO STORYBOARDS. J Stafford
          spreads them out on the table.
          Three other Komiteh in the room lean forward, their
          AUTOMATIC WEAPONS at their sides, and look at the
          STORYBOARD DRAWINGS. The Persian Empire futurism of Jack
          Kirby's drawings.

                         J STAFFORD

                         (FARSI) 
          These are the villains. Y'see
          these guys here? And these are
          the hers... in the spice
          market...
          J Stafford points at the various drawings. He speaks
          with an ease and confidence that we didn't know he had.

                         J STAFFORD

                         (FARSI) 
          They know our hero is the Chosen

           are just farmers, but they rise up 
           and find their courage and defeat 
           the alien king-- 
          Mendez watches. It's a performance. The three young
          Komiteh are now wide-eyed, pointing, whispering in Farsi,
          like teenagers around a comic book.
          Azizi says something to another Komiteh in the room.

                         THEN --

                         AZIZI

          You don't go until we verify.

                         MENDEZ
          You can call our office.
          Mendez hands Azizi his card. STUDIO SIX FILMS. Kevin
          Harkins. A 213 (818 wasn't around yet) phone number.

          ANGLES ON THE HOUSEGUESTS
          as Azizi leaves the room with the business card and three
          young Komiteh barely look up from the drawings --

          P.A., still holding Chambers and Siegel. The ACTOR
          playing the cop is conferring with the director. He's

          A PICKUP TRUCK with 5 Komiteh -- including Khalkali --
          automatic weapons out -- drives up to the Canadian
          Ambassador's residence.

          277 INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT - KOMITEH STATION - MORNING 277

          Azizi, who apparently has some authority here, enters,
          telling another Komiteh in Farsi to get off the phone.

          Azizi dials the long international number. And it is a
          DIAL, so this takes a long time.

          280 INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT - THIRD CHECKPOINT - MORNING 280

          One of the young Komiteh is loudly debating with another
          Komiteh the air-worthiness of a futuristic desert glider
          in the storyboards. He's miming the thing crashing.
          J Stafford and the Houseguests are silent. Mendez can
          see the line of passengers on their Swissair flight
          dwindling.

          Azizi comes back into the screened-off area. Looks at

          brief delay -- 
          Passengers groan a bit as they read paperbacks or

          around Cora. Lee Schatz is moving his mouth in what

          He picks up a walkie and pushes through the flight gate
          door, setting off an alarm, followed by the three other

          it's empty -- no. There's something inside.
          In one of the compartments is a STORYBOARD FROM ARGO.
          One that the Komiteh missed. While the Archives Officer
          is turned around, Mendez slips the storyboard back into
          the accordion folder and puts it back with his personal
          things.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           ARGO - Final 119.

          334 EXT. CIA - FRONT PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON 334

           O'Donnell is on his way out, heading toward Tony who is
           heading in. Seeing Mendez, he stops dead.

                          O'DONNELL
           And I left my autograph book at 
           home. His Eminence called me. He 
          wants to see you.

                         MENDEZ
          He wants to fire me himself.

                         O'DONNELL
          He wants to give you the
          Intelligence Star. You're getting
          the highest award of merit of the
          Clandestine Services of these
          United States. Ceremony's two
          weeks from today.
          Mendez stops walking. A beat.

                         MENDEZ
          If they push it a week, I can 
          bring Ian. That's his winter 
          break.

                         O'DONNELL
          The op was classified so the
          ceremony's classified. He can't
          know about it. Nobody can know
          about it.

                         MENDEZ
          They're gonna hand me an award,
          then they're gonna take it back?

                         O'DONNELL
          If we wanted applause, we would
          have joined the circus.

                         MENDEZ
          I thought we did.
          O'Donnell claps Tony on the shoulder. Tony walks towards
          the entrance and Jack heads to his car.

                         O'DONNELL
          (yelling to Tony; an

                         AFTERTHOUGHT)
          Carter said you were a great
          American.

          A great American what?

                         O'DONNELL
          He didn't say.

          335 INT. ARGO PRODUCTION OFFICE - ANGLE ON A POSTER - DAY 335

          on the wall. ARGO: A COSMIC CONFLAGRATION.
          A hand takes the poster down.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          Chambers is disassembling the office. Boxes packed.
          Everything now off the walls.
          A PRODUCER walks by, sees Chambers in the door.

                         PRODUCER
          What happened to your picture?

                         CHAMBERS
          It's in turnaround.
          He turns out the lights.

          336 EXT. ROAD UP TO CHRISTINE'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON 336

          Mendez's car heads up the road, past a mailbox. Pulls up
          to the house.

          337 EXT. CHRISTINE'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON 337

          Mendez, a duffel bag on his shoulder, knocks on the door.
          He waits. After a moment, Christine opens the door.

                         MENDEZ
          Hi.

                         CHRISTINE
          Hi.
          They look at each other.
          Before she can speak, he's embraced her. Holds tight. 
          It's something in between romantic and fraternal. Not
          reconciliation, necessarily, but warmth. She
          reciprocates. It feels right, and good.

          WIDEN to HOLD ON them holding each other in the dark hall
          of the very American, even Hummel-kitschy house. HOLD
          there for a while.

          339 INT. IAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 339

          We can hear the sounds of gunslinging from the movie.
          Glow-in-the-dark stars on the wall. A Star Wars X-Wing
          fighter. A couple of rubber Planet of the Apes figures
          that look like they've been chewed by a dog.
