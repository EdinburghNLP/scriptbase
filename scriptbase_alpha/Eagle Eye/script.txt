          FADE IN:

          EXT. DESERT DUNES - DAWN

          CLOSE ON A WOODEN STICK-FIGURE TOY, held by a SIX YEAR OLD BOY.
          Another BOY grabs the toy away and RUNS OFF, laughing --
          CHILDREN are playing under a cluster of date palms, part of a
          small desert commune somewhere in the Middle East. Their
          MOTHERS, veiled in black, gather and talk. Bearded, turbaned
          MEN carrying AK-47's argue politics. A domestic, even tranquil
          scene of life in another part of the world...

          EXT. DESERT ROAD - CONTINUOUS

          A CARAVAN of VEHICLES RACE DOWN A HIGHWAY:. SUV's mounted with
          surface-to-air RPG's form a protective cordon around a BLACK
          MERCEDES. As the cars ROAR INTO LENS, we go.to:

          EXT. RIDGE ABOVE ROAD - DAWN

          POV THOUGH A LONG-RANGE SCOPE: the caravan as seen by a TWO-MAN
          SPECIAL OPS TEAM perched on a ridge. As the LEADER surveils the
          cars, his partner finishes assembling a two-foot UAV (Unmanned
          Aerial Vehicle), rigging it with EXPLOSIVES:

          SPECIAL FORCES LEADER
          We have visual onthetarget. Confirm
          'go' for UAV launch.

          INT. PENTAGON - JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER - NIGHT


          SUPER: "JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER, THE PENTAGON"
          Sat-feeds monitor the caravan. Military brass observes:
           SECRETARY OF DEFENSE GEOFF CALLISTER (50's, African American;
           eyes with soul and a wary intelligence). Beside him: COLONEL
          THOMPSON (Full-Bird, decorated).

          COLONEL THOMPSON
          Alpha One, you're confirmed 'go': active
          UAV at GPS papa, zulu, three, zero.

          EXT. RIDGE ABOVE ROAD - DAWN

          The Ops Team activates a remote transmitter, LAUNCHING the UAV
          into the sky like a small ROCKET -- amazingly, its silent.

          INT. PENTAGON - JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER - CONTINUOUS

          An airborne feed from the UAV shows it descending on the
          caravan. A PENTAGON TECHIE manipulates a JOY STICK, controlling
          the drone from 6500 miles away:

          PENTAGON TECHIE #1
          We have system control.

          EXT. SKIES OVER DESERT - CONTINUOUS

          DRONE POV: tracking the caravan, singling out the MERCEDES. The
          drone emits a THIN LASER BEAM that hits its rear windshield --

          INT. THE PENTAGON - JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER - DAY

          Over speakers, VOICES speak "Balochi." A TRANSLATOR listens:

          CALLISTER
          Is it him?

          TRANSLATOR
          Four males, one of them's speaking with
          a.. I think it's a Rakhshaniâ€¢dialect,
          consistent with our intel on Al=Khoei.

          COLONEL THOMPSON
          Gimme voiceprint analysis.
          The screen pops to an AUDIO WAVEFORM of the conversation.
          VOICEPRINT ANALYSIS finishes, the; screen shows a FILE PHOTO of a

          BEARDED MAN: "37% PROBABLE MATCH = ID AL-KHOEI."

          CALLISTER
          I'm not taking 37% to-the President...
          John, weigh in here?
          He looks to a plasma: the PRESIDENT'S CABINET is assembled via
          teleconference from the White House Situation Room:

          DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE
          CIA and NCTC concur this is the target
          based on reliable Intel from the Brits.
          WHIP TO another monitor: the caravan starts to VEER off-road.

          TECHIE
          Sire they're pulling off the highway.

          TECHIE #2
          We have abort recommendation.
          The ANALYSIS ARRAY reads: "RECOINDATION: ABORT MISSION." The
          source of this recommendation, for now, remains a mystery.

          COLONEL THOMPSON
          If it's him, this guy comes out of hiding
          once in a lifetime, we can't let him go.

          CALLISTER
          (beat, torn)
          Alright, stay with him...

          

          

          

          

          3/28/07 3

          CONTINUED:
           THE SATELLITE VIEW shows the caravan approaching the commune.

          EXT. DESERT COMMUNE - DAY

          Mothers grab up their children and pull them aside as the
          vehicles arrive. ARMED MEN emerge...
          INTERCUTTING - THE PENTAGON OPS ROOM: the computer pinpoints
          DOTS on the satellite feed that represent WEAPONRY on-site --

          TECHIE
          We've got AK-47's, RPC's, Chaparral
          guided missiles --

          COLONEL THOMPSON
          Looks like a training camp.
          THE DESERT: Bodyguards cluster around a TURBANED:MAN as he
          emerges from the Mercedes. It looks a lot like the man from the
          file photo, but the beard makes it hard to confirm.
          MID-AIR WITH THE UAV: It SWOOPS, targeting the man -- SNAP:
          THE PENTAGON: a BLURRY SNAPSHOT of his FACE appears. A DIGITAL
          WIRE-FRAME is overlaid on the man's face: "5I$ PROBABLE MATCH -

          INSUFFICIENT DATA. RECOMMENDATION: ABORT MISSION."

          TECHIE
          51%. 'Abort' rec holds.
          THE DESERT: Now our guy DISAPPEARS into the crowd as they begin
          MOVING toward a large WOODEN PLANK on the desert floor. Some of
          the men take hold of the plank, drag it back to reveal... a PIT.
          THE PENTAGON: SAME IMAGE in real-time on the feeds:

          CALLISTER
          What is that, a weapons cache?

          ANALYST
          Sir, the placement of stones around the
          pit, markers for the Five Pillars of
          Islam... I think it's a funeral.
          Everyone trades looks -- this just got even more complicated.
          THE DESERT: from the back of a TENTED TRUCK, a BODY is lifted,
          shrouded in white. The men carry it through blowing sand... the
          procession stopping at the pit. They begin lowering the body...
          THE PENTAGON: on monitors, a section of the GENEVA CONVENTION

          SCROLLS:

          TECHIE
          Sir, striking a funeral would put us in
          violation of the Geneva convention.

          CONTINUED:

          COLONEL THOMPSON
          Once this guy's gone, he's gone.
          The PENTAGON GENERAL COUNCIL pipes in --

          PENTAGON GENERAL COUNCIL
          "Hors de Combat" -- legally we'd be open
          to international prosecution. But we
          have no independent intel verifying it's
          in fact a funeral, and the presence of
          weapons certainly leaves room for
          interpretation.

          TECHIE #2
          I have POTUS calling from Air Force One.

          CALLISTER
          (a beat, looks around).
          Everyone agree this is the best course of
          action?
          No one dissents. Callister picks up:

          CALLISTER (CONT'D)
          Mr. President, we have.a.51% identity
          match on Majid Al-Khoei. There is some
          possibility he's at a funeral, but we
          don't know. Regardless, counsel thinks
          we can claim 'Overriding Legal
          Authority.' Also, you should be aware we
          have an abort recommendation, but your
          cabinet, the Speaker, the Joint Chiefs
          urge a 'go.'

          THE PRESIDENT (V.0.)
          You left yourself out of the lineup.
          Callister pauses. AS THE MESSAGE ON THE MONITOR STARTS

          BLINKING: "ABORT, ABORT, ABORT..."

          CALLISTER
          Yessir... we gauge our strategy by two
          standards: the highest probability of
          success with the least amount of
          collateral damage. At 51% probability,
          we don't have either one.

          GENERAL THOMPSON
          And if it is Al-Khoei and he walks, Sir,
          we're putting our people at risk.
          There's a long silence as the President considers.

          

          

          

          

          3/28/07 5.

          CONTINUED: ( 2)

          THE PRESIDENT (V.0.)
          I respect your caution, Geoff, but we
          won't get another chance like this... you
          have a green light.
          Callister's obviously opposed, but he bites his tongue:

          CALLISTER
          Understood.
          (hangs up)
          We're weapons free.
          And with deadly calm, Techies execute orders into-headsets:

          EXT. DESERT - FUNERAL - DAWN

          The women begin to SING the "Nasheen," a.funeral song praising
          Allah. The beautiful VOICES grow until all other sound is GONE.
          DRONE POV: the feed from the CAMERA INSIDE THE NOSE-CONE as it
          LAUNCHES its missile -- it ZOOMS toward the funeral gathering --
          The haunting, beautiful voices WAIL... in the moment before
          impact, we see: birds flying across the great plain... a herd of
          running gazelles... the DESERT WIND blankets a layer of sand
          over the shrouded body in the pit... a CHILD'S HAND grasping his
          mother's...

          A WHITE FLASH AS THE MISSILE HITS:

          HOLD IN WHITE:
          CREDIT SE UENCE: WORDS CLOSE UP... a digitized electronic scan,
          as if they're being analyzed by someone: "We the people of the
          United States... more perfect union..." Highlights of The
          Constitution, The. Declaration of Independence...
          We land on: "...whenever any form of government becomes
          destructive...it is the right of the people to alter it or to
          abolish it..." CLOSE IN on these last words: "ABOLISH IT."

          WHITEWASH:

          INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT

          We're looking at a DIGITAL TIMER ticking down crucial seconds --
          then a MAN's FACE, intense, focused on something below screen:
          this is JERRY SHAW, 30, handsome, roguish. Somewhere between an
          adult and a child -- under his breath:

          JERRY
          damnit...

          

          

          

          

          3/28/07 6.

          CONTINUED:

          VOICE (O.S.)
          You gotta make a choice. You gotta move--

          JERRY
          -- I know.

           VOICE (O.S.)
           Now. Who are you gonna be?
           So Jerry makes his move, which we see is SLAMMING down a PLAYING
           CARD representing a group of DWARVES. He sits across from
          KWAME, 17. They're playing a geeky role-playing CARD and DICE
           game, CASH on the table.

           JERRY KWAME
           there. Dwarves?: Bullshit --
           Bullshit? I just blocked
           your ass and attacked with (checks card)
           Ancient Mastery points. --.dwarves don't have that --
          -- read the oracle text, my
          friend. -- shit
          A thick-mascara/black lipstick BECKY enters, removing her SMOCK:

          BECKY
          You know what would be great? If you
          guys took a longer break. That'd be
          awesome.

          JERRY
          Hey, Becky? When're you going to start
          wearing makeup?
          Kwame laughs as Becky tosses her smock at Jerry:

          BECKY
          .The collator's broken.

          JERRY
          Dude: no its not.

          BECKY
          (putting on a jacket)
          Oh yeah it is, dude!
          She heads out as Jerry collects the cash. Kwame puts on his own
          smock as Jerry offers him a quick lesson:

          JERRY
          Your first mistake? Underestimating
          dwarves. Power can come from anywhere --
          tomorrow night I'll give you first roll
          and a bonus pack if y--

          

          

          

          

          3/28/07 7.

          CONTINUED: ( 2)

          KWAME
          I'm not gonna be here tomorrow, remember?
          I'm going to Cornell.
          And Jerry stops. A hit to the solar plexus. Wherever we are,
          this kid's off to a bright future. But not Jerry.

          JERRY
          That -- wow. Good for you. So it's your
          last night. You're gonna spend it
          collating.

          KWAME
          -- what? But she said the collator's
          broken.

          JERRY
          And that's why we have those rubber
          thimbles in the drawer --.congratulations
          on Cornell, though, that's huge!
          TRACK WITH HIM out to... A COUNTER AREA as, he pins on his
          NAMETAG: "JERRY." Rows of COPY MACHINES and COMPUTER CUBICLES.
          He takes his place behind a register. Smiles, getting it up:

          JERRY (CONT'D)
          Welcome to Kinko's, how can I help you?
          The CHUGCLICK-CHUGCLICK-CHUGCLICK sound of the machines gets
          louder and louder as they BECOME THE SOUND OF:

          INT. "EL" SUBWAY CAR - MORNING

          The KRAK-KRAK-KRACKING SUBWAY. We glimpse people looking at
          their BLACKBERRYS. Talking on CELL PHONES. Listening to IPODS
          and playing GAME BOYS. The NEWS plays on an LCD mounted on the
          train wall. A society lost in an "electronic elsewhere."
          And JERRY, with a SKETCH PAD in his lap. A surprisingly good
          pencil rendering of the face of a LARGE DOG -- weird, but he's
          got talent. The TV disturbs his concentration -- news footage
          of BOMBED-OUT EMBASSIES, emergency vehicles, wounded victims:

          SHEPARD SMITH
          a heightened terror alert due to a
          series of suicide bombings, believed to
          be in retaliation for a deadly attack
          outside Abadan that killed forty people.
          Though the White House has denied
          involvement, Shia leaders have denounced
          the U.S. as responsible...

          Our warriors are already within your
          borders. Until American leadership is
          removed from power, Allah's revenge is
          upon you!
          And during all this, Jerry notices something: people are
          glancing at each other aranoid. What a fucking world...

          EXT. ATM MACHINE - MORNING

          An ATM CARD gets slid into the slot. Jerry looks up. THE ATM
          CAMERA IS STARING RIGHT AT HIM. Then, a BEEP gets his
          attention: "INSUFFICIENT FUNDS." He processes this a moment...
          his exhale doesn't just say, "FUCK," it says "FUCK 1 KNEW IT."

          INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LOBBY .-MORNING

          Saying it's a modest place would be kind. Jerry opens his
          mailbox. Just BILLS, some of which will:go unpaid this month.
          A BEAT as he shoves them back in and we HARD CUT TO:

          INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - MORNING

          A DOOR OPENS: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI, Jerry's elderly Polish landlady.
          Pleased to see him, but painfully annoyed to know what's coming:

          MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
          Jerry.

          JERRY
          Whatever are you cooking right now? Is
          the greatest thing I've ever smelled in
          my life, I swear to God --

          MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
          is schab wieprzowy po polsku -- you
          have the rent, yes?

          JERRY
          (puts cash in her hands)
          -- here's some of it -- most of it -- but
          I've got something else for you...
          something special...
          Eyebrows bobbing. Mrs. Wierzbowsky knows exactly what it is.
          Sighs. Knows she can't resist him --

          INT. KITCHEN - MRS. WIERZBOWSKI'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

          CLOSE ON Jerry pushing a THUMB TAC into the dog sketch we saw
          him doing on the subway. PULL BACK to reveal about 25 other
          sketches on the wall. All of the same dog. The actual DOG,
          Johann, lies underneath the kitchen table.

          CONTINUED:

          JERRY
          So I think. No, I'm pretty sure that's
          the best one so far ---

          MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
          Yes. Is good -- rent is better.
          She puts a bowl of STEW into Jerry's hands.

          MRS. WIERZBOWSKI (CONT'D)
          You are hungry, I am guessing.

          JERRY
          Oh, no, no. I couldn't --
          (looking down at bowl)
          Unless, you know, you insist.
          He sits at the table, starts eating. This is their routine.

          MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
          So where is girl? I don't see her?

          JERRY
          Oh, the redhead? No. She... that's
          over. She got smart.

          MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
          Like the others.

          JERRY
          Well, womenareIpretty smart. I've
          discovered.

          MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
          You are like Johann.
          Jerry stops eating, mouth full. As Johann looks up.

          JERRY
          Your -- I'm like your dog?

          MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
          Look at him. Is big dog. Labrador. But
          he believe... he is terrier. So is
          Labrador... but no labrador.
          Somehow Jerry can't get his eyes off Johann. Quietly:

          JERRY
          why do you think that is?
          As she pours a drink into a plastic cup --

          MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
          Perhaps many things. When I rescue
          Johann from pound, they say he was abuse.

           MRS. WIERZBOWSKI (CONT'D)
          As puppy. They kick him when baby, make
          him feel not big.
          (hands Jerry the cup)
          You need someone for rescuing you.
          Jerry looks at her, sad-smiles. Takes a sip and holy shit:

          JERRY
          This is -- vodka -- Jesus, its eight-
          thirty in the morning --

          MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
          -- you cannot eat bigos without vodka.
          Adjusting to it, Jerry drinks again -- as his CELL PHONE RINGS.
          He looks at his phone, freezing. Mrs. Wierzbowski notices.

          MRS. WIERZBOWSKI (CONT'D)
          Is the girl? Answer. Tell her you'. are
          Labrador. Then ask if she give you money
          for rent.
          But we've PUSHED IN on Jerry, who stares at the name on the
          phone. Something's affecting him deeply. He says, quietly:

          JERRY
          its my mother.

          MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
          Is problem?

          JERRY
          (even, quieter, gets up)
          is problem.

          INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

          Jerry steps outside as the phone keeps RINGING, debating: WHAT
          TO DO. Finally, he answers, as if ready for punishment:

          JERRY
          Hey, mom...
          Jerry stands there in silhouette. LISTENING. Something is
          happening... .suddenly he loses his balance -- sinks to the
          floor, phone to his ear -- staring in pain --

          EXT. CHURCH - DAY

          MOURNERS are gathering in their somber best, shaking hands.
          Across the street, we find Jerry, getting out of a taxi.
          Standing in a rumpled suit. Grim; the last thing he wants to do
          is enter that church. It's almost as if he can't. Finally,
          from somewhere, strength. He walks forward.

          

          

          

          

          3/28/07 11.

          INT. CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

          Jerry heads down the aisle, painfully self-conscious. Most of
          the MOURNERS are in the pews, turning to look at him as he
          passes. When suddenly there's a SCREAM OF TERROR -- and Jerry
          BRACES as if he was expecting it -- looks over at a WOMAN
          pointing like he was a fucking bodysnatcher and she collapses --
          Jerry holds up his hands as everyone turns to look at him--

          JERRY
          -- no! I-- I'm not him!
          All eyes on him. His voice, sad, heartbroken:

          JERRY (CONT'D)
          It's okay! I'm not Paul!
          Locks eyes with his MOTHER and FATHER up in the front pew.
          Their eyes red from crying, withered shells. And Jerry gives a
          lame wave before heading reluctantly up to the COFFIN.
          Devastated, he leans in -- and we MOVE AROUND to see the body:
          And it's fucking HIM -- Jerry's very own face, but one that
          seems to have been RECONSTRUCTED after some kind of accident.
          Gruesome and handsome all at once. This was PAUL SHAW. Jerry's
          identical twin. Off the surreal moment...
          A reverbed TRUMPET PLAYS, the tune familiar. In fact, it's:

          INT. APARTMENT - DAY

          THE NATIONAL ANTHEM, booming from a trumpet played by an 8 year-
          old boy: KYLE HOLLOMAN. A WOMAN blurs into frame: RACHEL
          HOLLOMAN, searching for car keys. 28, smart, beautiful, but
          fiercely independent, she's a single mom who's taken life's
          knocks. Never as cool-headed as she wants to be, she's on a
          short fuse with everyone but Kyle, whom she adores:

          RACHEL
          Okayokay... okay: we came home, put down
          the leftovers, you turned on the TV, I
          went over, I said no TV--
          She turns to the TV area and walks straight INTO a table. Stuns
          her, momentarily, but she doesn't break stride --

          KYLE
          -- we're gonna be late, huh?

          RACHEL
          -- absolutely not -- I turned it off,
          came over here, checked messages, put the
          leftovers in the--

          KYLE RACHEL
          --knocked over the phone-- --right, knocked over the
          phone, put it back, put the
          food in the fridge--
          She opens the fridge: HER KEYS sit atop a Tupperware container.
          Kyle hits a high note and we SLAM TO:

          INT. RACHEL'S CAR - MORNING

          The KEY turning in the ignition of a crappy, old Honda. The
          engine CHOKES, SPUTTERS. Rachel's tense--

          RACHEL
          we need to get a new car --

          KYLE
          I like your car. We're gonna be late.
          The engine still SPLIT-SPUT-SPUTTERING.::.. a BUS. whizzes by, slows
          up ahead at a bus stop. Rachel gives up, jumps out:

          RACHEL
          No we're not: the bus.

          KYLE
          -- are you kidding?

          EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

          Rachel and Kyle HAUL ASS toward the bus stop, both struggling
          with Kyle's carry-on, a.garment bag, her purse, and a trumpet
          case marked with STICKERS (Green Bay Packers among them)--

          RACHEL
          I put vitamins in your toiletry bag,
          don't forget to take two in the morning --

          KYLE
          and one at night, I know --

          RACHEL
          And your inhaler, which I may need to use
          now, is in the outside pocket -- wait!
          They rush back to a MAILBOX, she pulls bills from her purse:

          KYLE
          More bills?

          RACHEL
          Yup -- that's what happens when you have
          a kid on lay-away.
          They smile at each other. When SUDDENLY a BUS ROARS PAST the
          WIND GUSTS and the bills go FLYING into traffic:

          RACHEL (CONT'D)

          OH, SHIT! STAY HERE!
          Rachel waves her arms at oncoming cars, runs INTO TRAFFIC--

          KYLE

          YOU SWORE!!
          As she chases the bills, SCREECHING and HONKING around her:

          RACHEL

          I KNOW, I'M SORRY!
          (Porsche HONKS as it

          PASSES)

          HEY, A LITTLE COMMON COURTESY, ASSHOLE!
          And she runs back to Kyle, THROWS the bills in the mailbox --

          KYLE
          You swore again. Was that our bus?
          Rachel looks: PAN to across the street, the bus is now LEAVING
          THE BUS STOP. PAN back to Rachel: SHIT!!

          RACHEL:
          Okay, now were gonna.be late.
          She puts fingers in her mouth and WHISTLES HARD for a cab --

          INT. TRAIN STATION - WISCONSIN - DAY

          A CLASS OF MUSIC STUDENTS boards and Amtrak train. Rachel and
          Kyle are RUNNING through the crowd toward them --

          RACHEL
          Scuze us, coming through, sorry -- WAIT!!

          WAIT!!
          Finally they arrive. Kyle's teacher, MRS. MILLER, smiles:

          MRS. MILLER
          Under the wire --

          RACHEL
          (gulping breaths)
          Hi -- sorry -- Rachel Holloman, we met--

          MRS. MILLER
          -- of course, Barbara Miller.
          (looks at watch)
          You should probably --
          And Rachel's stomach drops. Knows they've been racing towards
          this moment all morning but still not willing to accept it.
          Turning Kyle to face her --

          

          

          

          

          3/28/07 14.

          RACHEL
          Okay. Now. I want you to have an
          awesome time --

          KYLE
          I will, mom --

          RACHEL
          -- you can eat junk food, just remember
          to brush your teeth; and if you're gonna
          goof off, just be really smart about it;
          and try not to stay up past your bedtime,
          you get really cranky when you do that'--
          (turns to Mrs. Miller)
           He gets very contrarian if he doesn't get
          at least eight --

          MRS. MILLER
          I'm afraid it's time to board, Mrs.
          Holloman.
          Tears springing to Rachel's eyes. She tries to hide them.
          Bending down to be eye to eye with her son. Sotto --

          RACHEL
          You see all these kids? They're all
          calling their mothers. You just do it
          more --

          KYLE
          It's only two days,: mom. Y'know... you
          could try and some have fun too, wouldn't
          kill ya..

          RACHEL
          Fun? What's that?
           (hugging him)
           I love you so much, baby.You're my
           everything. Rock the house.

           KYLE
          -- love you too --
          They separate -- she watches as Kyle boards with Mrs. Miller:

           RACHEL
          Call me!

          MRS. MILLER
          Your mom gonna be okay?

          KYLE
          It's unclear.
          As they head into the train, Rachel steels herself and GOES.
          Passing the BAGGAGE AREA...

          We HOLD as the PORTER places Kyle's TRUMPET CASE on a conveyor
          belt. Oddly, it's ELECTRONICALLY REDIRECTED AWAY FROM THE OTHER
          INSTRUMENTS -- down a separate belt, where it emerges in a pick-
          up turnstile. Its lifted off the track by...
          A MIDDLE EASTERN MAN. Nervous. Really nervous. And the
          strangest thing -- he touches his ear and MURMURS something in
          Tajiki. To no one. Like a crazy person. What the hell?
          Walks to the curb where his white van idles. On the side is a
          decal: "HASSAD DRY CLEANERS." Loads the trumpet inside as we:

          INT. SHAW HOME - AFTERNOON

          Solemn quiet. Mourners talking in hushed tones. A buffet. Old
          people. Children. And over these shots, WHISPERED VOICES:

          WOMAN #1 (V.O.)
          you didn't know either?

          WOMAN #2 (V.0.)
          No idea.

          WOMAN #3 (V.0.)
          I knew he had a brother. But not a twin,
          that was...

          WOMAN.#1 (V.0.)
          I know, I know...
          Four WOMEN sit together. Heartbroken, unsettled. One glances
          across into a sitting room, where Jerry sits alone on a sofa.
          We're CLOSE on Jerry now. Holding a glass, etched with hearts.
          Looking at it as if it means something. Somehow, his childhood.
          He looks up at the stairs, as if knowing he needs to go up
          there. So he does. We MOVE with him:

          WOMAN #1 (CCNT'D)
          when was the last time they saw him?

          WOMAN #2
          Margaret said years...

          TROPHIES. RIBBONS. All of them awarded to PAUL SHAW. TIGHT on
          Jerry's face as he scans the shelves of evidence. Evidence that
          he had a brother. A superior brother. Again and again we see:
          PAUL SHAW. PAUL SHAW. PAUL. PAUL. Then Jerry finds one
          framed CERTIFICATE. In the back. A Junior High ART PRIZE.
          Awarded to JERRY SHAW. He smiles at the fucking absurdity of it
          as a figure appears behind him...

          It's WILLIAM. Their father. The worst day of this man's life.
          Jerry composes himself quickly. They stare for a moment.

          WILLIAM
          Six months without a boo or a bah.

          JERRY
          Didn't realize it'd been that long.

          WILLIAM
          Your mom was worried. So where were you
          this time?

          JERRY
          Nowhere.
          (then, a touch reticent)
          Singapore. Alaska for a few weeks.
          got a job for a while. On a...fishing
          boat. Met some great p-

          WILLIAM
          -- that's nice. Looks like you're really
          seeing the world.

          JERRY
          I'm trying, you know, just to --
          But William has just started crying.. Sobs of absolute loss.
          Jerry stands there, frozen, until William EMBRACES HIM. Jerry
          hugs him back -- tightly, grateful and starting to feel again.
          And just then, William says, quietly, through tears:

          WILLIAM
          You sound just like him.
          Jerry's eyes find a point in space. This is love by proxy. And
          now he hugs, his father in support, not unity. William pulls
          back. Takes his wallet from his pocket:

           WILLIAM (CONT'D)
           I want to give you some, uh...

           JERRY
          No. -- Dad, I'm okay. I'm doing really
          well. I promise.
          His father holds out some bills. North of two-hundred dollars.
          It's a stand-off. The question is: does Jerry have enough pride
          to reject the offer? And the answer is...

          EXT. CHICAGO STREET - ATM MACHINE - DAY

          CLOSE ON THE PIN NUMBER AGAIN, getting PUNCHED IN. Then FIND
          JERRY, exhausted from the funeral, slipping the money his father
          gave him into a deposit envelope. A glance at the SECURITY
          CAMERA. Then a BEEP makes him look at the screen.

           What the HELL? Glances back to the people behind him, they want
           him to hurry. He hits "Cancel." But the machine, as if
          disobeying, spits out five $100 bills--

           JERRY
           -- whoa --
           Jerry stabs cancel again. Now TEN MORE $100 bills-come out. He
           glances at the people in line, nervous--

           JERRY (CONT'D)
           -- two seconds, sorry --
          Eyes flick back to the ATM CAMERA. He covers it with his hand,
          pushes "cancel" again and again. But now.. TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS
          IN $100 BILLS HAS COME OUT, getting JAMMED' in the slot. People
          start to PEER OVER as Jerry SCRAMBLES to keep the cash from
          flying everywhere. And finally. The machine stops. He stuffs
          all the money in his pocket. Everyone's staring.

          JERRY (CONT'D)
          Big date. So... fingers crossed.

          INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT BUILDING.- HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Jerry enters, a little dazed -- heads for his apartment as Mrs.
          Wierzbowski steps from. hers, Johann hiding behind her:

          MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
          Jerry! All day they make delivery!
          Jerry moves fast to her, a little out of breath -- shoves a
          thousand dollars into her hand:

          JERRY
           Here's the rest of the rent -- next
          month's, too --

          MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
          -- where do you get this?

          JERRY
          Just take it -- it's okay, I owe you --

          MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
          I had to open your apartment, too many

          Jerry whips open his apartment door -- as far as he can: it's
          blocked by something. He reaches in, flips on the LIGHT: BOXES
          EVERYWHERE. Reeling, he picks one up, rips it open. Packing
          peanuts fly: a pair of night-vision binoculars. WHAT IS
          HAPPENING? Goes through more boxes in a flurry of CUTS:
           FALSE PASSPORTS; a POLICE SCANNER; BODY ARMOR; HAND GUNS; large
          BAGS OF FERTILIZER; strange CHEMICALS; 747 MANUALS. Jerry looks
          around, fear and confusion growing. His cell rings.,. startles
          him -- all the LCD says is: "ANSWER NOW."

          JERRY
          -- hello?
          A WOMAN'S VOICE. We can't place why... but it's really creepy.

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          Look out your window. They're coming for
          you.

          JERRY
          (totally thrown)
          -- what? Who is this?

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          Jerry. You have to run.

          JERRY
          Who the hell is this?!
          Rips back the curtain to see a SWAT VAN SCREECHING UP -- a flack-
          jacketed TEAM pours out, assault rifles ready. Jerry goes pale.

          WOMAN'S VOICE
           Leave your residence. Get to the Mathis
          train station. You have 4 minutes.

          JERRY
          Jesus Christ -- what's happening?!

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          Run, or you'll be captured and convicted
          -- go NOW.
          CLICK. POUNDING BOOTS AGAINST PAVEMENT OUTSIDE. Jerry whirls,
          goes out to the hall, hears THEM coming. Starts to run. But a

          TACTICAL TEAM STORMS THE HALL. ASSAULT RIFLES AIMED AT HIM:

          TEAM LEADER JERRY

          NOW! DOWN ON THE FLOOR OR WE THIS ABOUT THE--THE ATM?! I

          INT. DHS FIELD OFFICE - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

          Jerry sits cuffed to a table. Frightened, confused, on the
          defensive. The door opens and AGENT THOMAS MORGAN enters: 40s,
          born to the job, never smiles. Takes a seat, opens a "file:

          JERRY
          Look, man, I don't know what this is -- I
          don't know how all that shit got in my
          apartment, but unless you're my lawyer--

          MORGAN
          My condolences. I understand you've had
          a tough day.

          JERRY
          it hasn't been ideal.

          MORGAN
          Your brother worked for the State
          Department.
          This was almost a question. And while it's obviously news to
          us, Jerry clearly knew...

          JERRY
          You tell me.

          MORGAN
          Were you close?

          JERRY
          Why? What am I doing here. I don't even
          know who you are.
          Morgan tosses his black leather BADGE WALLET onto the metal
          table. It lands open with a substantial CLUNG!

          MORGAN
          Tom Morgan, Special Agent attached to the
          National Counterterrorism Center.

          JERRY
          (stares, rocked)
          Counterterrorism Center? You think I'm --

          MORGAN
          -- according to phone records, your
          brother called you twelve times in the
          last year. You never called him back.

          JERRY
          If you're asking if we were the kind of
          freaky twins you see at the mall wearing
          the same shirt, no. Listen, Paul
          traveled a lot, so we didn't --

          CONTINUED:

          MORGAN
          Oh. That's right. He stamped visas in
          Karachi for a year. Then was a junior
          FSO in Beirut. Interesting places.

          JERRY
          What're you... saying.

          MORGAN
          I'm just saying you didn't talk much.
          maybe you did.

          JERRY
          Am I getting a lawyer here? 'Cause
          didn't hear my rights read to me--

          MORGAN
          You familiar with the slogan, "Declare
          War on War?"

          JERRY
          what? No, why?
          Morgan pulls out a SURVEILLANCE PHOTO: Jerry, college-age, at a
          STUDENT RALLY holding up a sign with an image of the Pentagon
          crossed out in red: "DECLARE WAR ON WAR!"

          MORGAN
          Because you painted it when you were part
          of the student activist group "Project
          Underground" at Berkley.

          JERRY
          (stares-at pic; LAUGHS)
          Wait. Come on -- okay: her name was
          Julia, she was the smokinist girl I'd
          ever seen and she wanted me -- I would've
          gone to an "Anti-Oxygen" rally for her.
          I swear to God, dude--

          MORGAN
          Don't "dude" me. I'm not your friend. I
          don't have friends... so: Jerry. Why'd
          you drop out of school?

          JERRY
          Why'd you stay in? I don't know, I
          didn't really see the point.

          MORGAN
          You haven't been able to hold a job

          JERRY
          Unless I've been fired from Kinko's,
          which is a statistical impossibility, I'm
          holding a job right now.

          myself yet --

          MORGAN
          Who deposited the seven-fifty?

          JERRY
          For as second I thought God, maybe. The
          ATM was obviously broken -- or do..
          accidents not happen in your . universe?

           MORGAN JERRY
          The money originated from the --this is all -- listen, this

          right, we haven't really

          Morgan stares at him, unmoved.

          told me I was gonna be arrested. GET

          REAL, MAN! DO I LOOK LIKE A TERRORIST TO

          YOU?!?!

          MORGAN
          No more than Abdul Hamid, Taliban POW we
          caught in Afghanistan. Except his real
          name was Johnny Walker Lindh. Grew up in
          Marin County with a basketball hoop in
          his driveway and a carton of Tropicana in
          his fridge. He was blonder than you..
          though.

          (RISES)
          When I come back, you'd better tell me
          who you work for--

          INT. DHS OBSERVATION ROOM - HALLWAY CONTINUOUS

          Morgan meets supervisor MARTIN KREBS, a senior D.H.S. big wig.
          Standing with LATESHA.SIMMS, 32 but looks 16, African-American,
          computer wonk with no room fora personal life; and TOBY GRANT,
          20's, straight part in his hair, wet behind the ears. They've
          all been observing through a two-way mirror. Latesha refers to
          a laptop, one she clutches like a safety blanket:

          LATESHA
          He fits the profile: disaffected,
          'susceptible to radical indoctrination,
          problem with authority. Doesn't vote or
          pay taxes, but witness statements all say
          he's not a player. He does sketches of
          his landlady's dog. Oh, and he's lying
          about the woman who called him -- we
          checked the records, no calls came in
          before we picked him up --

          KREBS
          What about the brother?

          LATESHA
          Mid-level FSO. Been stateside the past
          three years. No red flags. He was
          killed when a truck ran a light in
          Crystal City.

          threat and were smiling and saying
          "coincidence?"

          KREBS
          So either he's a rank-and-file sleeper or
          a dumbshit mule.

          GRANT
          (eager to contribute)
          Or a misdirect. There's nothing subtle
          about him or the gear. He's not exactly
          a pro--
          Morgan levels a look at Grant as Krebs takes .a BEAT. Figuring
          out the next move:

          KREBS
          Get Smith on financials; Rieger on
          travel; and let's dryclean family and
          friends. Again.
          (to Morgan, veiled

          THREAT)
          I don't want the FBI rushing in on this.
          Break him. Fast.
          And leaves Morgan to twist.. The pressure's on. To Latesha:

          MORGAN
          v m m putting you on the brother.

          LATESHA
          Great, I'll access State's database

          MORGAN
          No, I want you to go there.

          INT. GAMMAGE & BURNHAM LAW OFFICES - WISCONSIN - NIGHT

          Rachel's doing paperwork at her desk. People leave. for the
          night. An attorney named MICHAEL approaches; warm, good-
          looking, by all standards, a catch. She doesn't look up.

          MICHAEL
          He's out of town.

          RACHEL
          Yup.

          MICHAEL
          Which seems like a perfect ;opportunity
          for a second date. In theory.

          RACHEL
          In theory -- but I gotta site-check this
          brief, courier's coming in,.,the morning.

          MICHAEL
          Didn't we have a good time? Remember
          that? Our first date? Back in the 40's?
          He's so agreeably genuine, she wants to let him down easy:

          RACHEL
          I had a great. time, I told you that
          but I'm so busy and...

          MICHAEL
          Ooo.o, shit, the "so busy" speech -- stop
          -- not worthy of you. Or me. I'm
          patient, so... call me. When you're not
          busy.

          RACHEL
          Kyle goes to college in nine years-- it
          should be somewhere around then.

          MICHAEL
          I would so wait a decade for you. Call
          me his sophomore year, I'll prove it.
          And with a smile he heads off. She watches him go -- dammit!
          really liking him in this moment. She watches longer than she
          should... then goes back to her work.
          He gets in the elevator and she's left in her solitude. And now
          we BEGIN TO SEE the first signs of it: loneliness.

          PHONE RINGS. Rachel jumps. Staring at the IM. Then at the

          Rachel's eyes drop down to the LINK at the bottom of her screen.
          What? Leans out from her cubicle to look around -- NO ONE ELSE

          AT THEIR DESK.

          RACHEL
          who is this?
          As she clicks on the link. And a STREAMING IMAGE APPEARS: A

          BLACK AND WHITE SURVEILLANCE CAM OFKYLE ON HIS TRAIN, LAUGHING

          Jerry's eyes scan the area... then he FREEZES. THE ELECTRONIC

          SCHEDULE SIGN HAS CHANGED TO READ: "JERRY, BOARD TEE TRAIN"

          THEN JUST AS FAST, ITS BACK TO THE SCHEDULE.
          HOW IS THIS HAPPENING?! Across the station, Jerry sees Morgan
          and a team of Agents pouring down the stairs =- he runs onto the
          train as the DOORS CLOSE -- Morgan turns, doesn't see him.

          INT. SUBWAY CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

          The train at full speed. Oblivious Commuters. Jerry tries to
          calm down, make some sense. Notices. the SECURITY CAMERA in the
          corner, turns from it. An LCD.onthe train broadcasts CNN:

          CNN NEWSCASTER
          has elevated our alert status to
          threat level "Orange." Insiders say
          tomorrow night's State of the Union
          address will focus on...

          CONDUCTOR (V.0.)
          Next stop, Montrose Station.
          A CELL RINGS from a phone peeking out of a SLEEPING PASSENGER'S
          BACKPACK. He looks at it, oddly suspicious. The LCD GOES BLACK
          -- then the words "ANSWER IT, JERRY" appear. Looks around: no
          one saw it. Slips the phone from the guy's backpack -- turns
          away, hits "answer":

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          Stay on the train for three more stations
          until you r--
          But Jerry HANGS UP -- WON'T HAVE THIS. And as the train slows,
          he moves to the door and --

          EXT. MONTROSE STATION - NIGHT

          JUMPS off the train, pushes through the busy platform. Spots
          TWO TRANSIT OFFICERS talking on radios as they scan the crowd.
          Jerry turns and ducks into another TRAIN just as --

          

          

          

          

          3/28/07 29.

          INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT

          The DOORS CLOSE. Jerry sits, exhales. Then the cell phone --
          which he stole -- RINGS AGAIN. He tenses. Won't answer. It
          finally stops ringing. Could it all be over? NO, BECAUSE THE

          TRAIN'S EMERGENCY BRAKES SUDDENLY KICK IN, GEARS SCREECH, PEOPLE
          TUMBLE... and the train stops. Everyone looks around, confused,
          frightened. Suddenly, the train starts MOVING BACKWARDS--

          JERRY

          --NO--

          EXT. REAR SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT

          The rear subway car's now become the front. TILT DOWN to the
          track, it SWITCHES OVER to another line all.by itself --

          INT. SUBWAY CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

          People are FREAKING OUT -- and Jerry feels some insane guilty
          complicity in all this, as the PHONE.RINGS AGAIN--

          JERRY
          -- Jesus --
           (and he answers)

          HELLO.

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          I told you not to get off yet.

          JERRY
          -- listen -- lady -- who are you?!

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          He knows you're here.
          Jerry turns and sees A TRANSIT COP through the glass doors that
          connect the cars -- he's talking into a shoulder-mounted walkie
          talkie. Looking right at JERRY --

          JERRY
          --.how do you know that? Where are you?
          Jerry notices ANOTHER SECURITY CAMERA in the corner as:

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          Next stop is Damen Station. Take the
          Northwest exit. There will be a black
          BMW sedan. Get in the passenger seat.

          JERRY
          Go to hell. How's that.
          He hangs up, drops the phone and STOMPS ON IT. Eyes from fellow
          passengers. THEN EVERY CELL PHONE ON BOARD RINGING IN UNISON.

          

          

          

          

          3/28/07 30.

          CONTINUED:
          Jerry watches, stunned, as passengers start answering -- all
          hearing the same thing:

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          The man in the black t-shirt is a wanted
          terrorist. His name is Jerry Shaw.
          Everyone TURNS TO Jerry, backs away, but a HUGE MAN stands:

          HUGE MAN
          -- you Jerry Shaw?
          EVERYONE looking, a few even start to move for him. Jerry goes
          for the door, but the SUBWAY COP'S there, about to enter, but
          the door's locked. Jerry yells to the passengers.:

          JERRY

          STAY AWAY FROM ME!
          The COP pulls his gun, yelling through the glass:

          TRANSIT COP

          EVERYBODY DOWN! GET DOWN?
          Suddenly, the train SPEEDING, the DOORS OPEN! A BLAST OF WIND!
          People SCREAM, take cover as the.train .pulls into the station,
          the COP about to SHOOT when Jerry jumps, LANDING HARD ON THE
          PLATFORM -- ROLLS -- and the COP FIRES! People SCREAM and RUN,
          as the moving train separates Jerry from the Cop -- Jerry gets
          to his feet, sprints towards the northwest exit and --

          EXT. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

          Out of the station! Spots the BLACK 760 BMW SEDAN parked by the
          curb -- sleek, ultra-fast. Jerry tears open the passenger door,
          jumps inside, meeting, behind the wheel:

          INT. BMW 760 SEDAN - NIGHT

           RACHEL. Terrified. Assuming Jerry is behind all of this.
           Jerry, breathing hard, assuming she is The Voice:

          WOMAN'S VOICE

          RACHEL JERRY

          She SLAMS the gas -- the car SCREECHES ONTO THE ROAD, another
          car avoiding it, SLAMMING into a BUS -- Rachel LURCHES and
          GRINDS as she shifts gears --

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          Turn left in two-hundred feet.
          Indeed they do: TWO POLICE CARS BLAST AROUND A STREET CORNER
          FOUR BLOCKS BEHIND THEM -- DOPPLER HORNS as we CUT BACK TO:

          Two cop cars have become THREE in the rearview mirror -- even
          more insane, Â°all.the TRAFFIC LIGHTS are suddenly changing to
          create a MIRACLE PATH for the BMW -- stopping traffic to let
          them pass,. starting it up again to CUT OFF the cop cars. It's

          Rachel looks up too -- eyes wide: A TEN-STORY-TALL CONSTRUCTION

          CRANE TURNING FAST, THE BLOCK-LONG ARM SWINGING ABOVE THE

           JERRY (CONT'D)

          SHIT!!
          And the STEEL BEAMS SLAM INTO THE PAVEMENT, JUST BEHIND THE BMW,

          JERRY

          GO RIGHT GO RIGHT!!!
          Rachel yanks the wheel, SKIDS round the corner -- more police

          You'll turn at the next alley: avoid the

          Rachel skids right, but TWO COP CARS appear. Too late to stop
          WHAM! The BMW SMASHES THROUGH -- both cop cars go flying.

          RACHEL

          IN THE BMW: Jerry and Rachel speed through an industrial marina.
          Up ahead, the intersection's closed by a POLICE BARRICADE.

          Turn right in two-hundred feet.

          they collide, she TURNS RIGHT. Morgan SLAMS his brakes -- his

          Just then: KA-CHUNK!! Something just SLAMMED onto the ROOF -- a
          high-pitched VREEEEE as he car's tires SPIN in overdrive but
          suddenly FIND NO ROAD BENEATH THEM! And impossibly, as the
          brick wall GROWS HUGE coming right at us through the windshield,
          the car RISES OFF THE GROUND -- LITERALLY FLYING --

          JERRY RACHEL

          HOW ARE YOU DOING THIS?!?! I'M NOT!!!
          -- and now we REVEAL: A GIANT, INDUSTRIAL MAGNET attached to the
          top of the BMW, HOISTING it up on a DOCK CRANE -- the jib arm
          PIVOTS, swinging them over a CRANE YARD...
          Minds blown, they swing past the crane's DRIVER'S SEAT and
          see... NOBODY'S AT THE CONTROLS. The crane DIPS THEM toward a
          wooden railing overlooking the RIVER -- they CRASH THROUGH it.
          The release arm DROPS the BMW -- Jerry and Rachel SCREAM as they
          PLUMMET -- but the car doesn't hit water, instead it falls onto:
          A GARBAGE BARGE floating downriver. The car lands in a mountain
          of trash. The crane STOPS, just as... Morgan and the cops
          APPEAR, screeching in at the broken railing.

          They jump from their cars, look down into the river and see
          NOTHING. Morgan KICKS a trash can, pissed:

          MORGAN
          Seal the harbor, get divers in the water!
          PAN UP TO the horizon... where the garbage barge floats lazily
          down Lake Michigan. Jerry and Rachel escaped... for now.

          DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. BARGE - DAWN

          Jerry, dazed but driven, SLAMS a piece of plywood again and
          again into the LEXAN WINDOW of the barge's CONTROL BOOTH.
          Rachel paces, on her cell -- hearing:

           KYLE'S VOICE
           This is Kyle. Who is not allowed to. use
           this phone with my friends... so leave a

          -- check your messages and.call me.
          Sweetie. I love y_ou.
          And she hangs up, staring'off. CRASH! Jerry's knocked the
          window back -- opens the control booth door and enters, examines
          the controls. The computer panel reads: "CONTROL OVERRIDE."

          JERRY
          -- this thing's on auto-pilot or
          something. Which doesn't happen, these
          barges are operated, by people.
          He steps out. In thought, tears in her eyes, Rachel asks:

          RACHEL
          D'youthink -- she could derail a train?

          JERRY
          Are you kidding me? She changed every
          traffic light! This woman's called me on
          other people's phones -- some dude who
          happened to be sitting next to me! His
          phone rang -- it was her! For me! She
          broke me out of maximum-security custod
          in a way I'm not even gonna tell you
          cause you won't believe it -- and you
          saw how she directed us away from the
          police, then lifted us outta the world
          and dropped our ass onto the ghost barge!
          Can she derail a train? She could
          probably turn a train into a duck. Yes.
          I think she c--

          CONTINUED:
          -- but now he stops, because Rachel is crying. Jerry lamely
          attempts to backpedal:

          JERRY (CONT'D)
          I mean... I don't know, I'm not sure she
          could derail a train, what the hell do I
          know?
          Rachel brushes her tears away. Afraid, but fighting it.

          RACHEL
          My son is on a train. She threatened to
          kill him if I don't do what she says.
          They share a look. The difference between them galvanized in an
          instant. She has something to lose.

          RACHEL (CONT'D)
          You tell me -- how does someone do all
          this?
          When: RING! A CELL PHONE. Rachel looks down, hoping it's Kyle
          -- but it's not her phone. They realize the phone's somewhere
          in the trash. Jerry starts digging. It's nast Finally, he
          finds it in an old take-out box --- re: the phone.

          JERRY
          -- you see what I mean?
          He wipes it off, holds it to his ear despite the stench;

           JERRY (CONT'D)
          Hello?

           WOMAN'S VOICE
           You both need to swim to shore. Go to

          CLICK -- she's gone. Jerry hangs up, turning something
          unnerving in his mind.

          JERRY
          She called you "the female."
          (beat, weird)
          That's like... something a foreigner would
          say, like a bad translation. But she has
          no accent.

          RACHEL
          Jerry, that's your name, right? Are we
          swimmincr?

          JERRY
          Does it bring back memories of
          Westport Y?

          RACHEL
          (pale, at a whisper)
          how did you know that?

          JERRY
          I didn't.
          And they turn to look down at the FREEZING RIVER WATER as we PRE-
          LAP the SOUND of a clear F SHARP and CUT TO --

          INT. A&B INSTRUMENT REPAIR MORNING

          An OLD MAN blowing into KYLE,'S TRUMPET. Thick glasses, sweater
          vest, INSTRUMENTS stacked all over the place. Kyle's familiar
          CASE with the Packers' sticker open next to him.

          STORE OWNER
          You sure you want to replace it? Sounds
          pretty good to me.
          And we reveal MIDDLE EASTERN MAN standing at the counter. Eyes
          darting, nervousShoves a small BOX into the man's hand.

          MIDDLE EASTERN MAN
          Yes. I'm sure. Please do it now.
          The Store Owner looks into the box.

          STORE OWNER
          I do a lot of custom jobs, never seen
          something like this before. I can have
          it for you by the end of the week.
          The Middle Eastern Man. MUMBLING again in Tajiki. Seemingly,
          to himself. The Store Owner stares, kinda freaked out --

          STORE OWNER (CONT'D)
          Sorry, what?

          No. Is not possible. it must be
          done this afternoon --

          STORE OWNER
          Listen, Mister --
          The Middle Eastern Man suddenly touches his ear, BARKS out
          something in Tajiki. Like he's arguing with someone.

          STORE OWNER (CONT'D)
          -- are you okay?

          MIDDLE EASTERN MAN
          (looks at his watch)
          I will pay you triple. Please. A
          courier will be by to pick it:'up at
          three. Do it, please... please.
          And stepping back, he exits quickly. The Store Owner watches
          him leave, then looks back down at the BOX.

          INT. RIVER SIDE - DAY

          A Coast Guard cutter floats beside the now-abandoned garbage
          barge. The BMW's been lifted ashore by a crane -- FORENSIC
          TECHS comb every inch. MORGAN circles the car. Grant follows,
          a WAITING CHOPPER in the background.

          AGENT GRANT
          All the surveillance cameras in the area
          have turned up nothing -- no ID on the
          girl, nothing on the VIN --

          MORGAN
          All I want is a goddamn picture of her --
          what about traffic cams? There are more
          cameras on that route than the Super

          BOWL--

          AGENT GRANT
          Department of Transpo says there was a

          Do NOT tell me their equipment
          was down! Do NOT! Sir, that's what they're
          telling me...
          From Northbrook to the
          290?! What about the bogus
          fax from Justice, was that
          equipment failure too? -- No sir, there's gotta be
           someone on the inside.

          CONTINUED:
          Pissed, Morgan starts -- fast -- for the chopper -- we move with
          him and Grant, who keeps up:

          MORGAN
          The getaway car was waiting there -- get
          me a witness description on the woman
          driving -- remember witnesses? People
          who see things?! Jesus, is this a lost
          art?

          AGENT GRANT
          I have Markey on that right now
          Morgan's PHONE IS RINGING -- he answers:

          MORGAN
          Morgan. When? NO. You tell them hold
          that 'til I talk to Sanford -
          (hangs up, to Grant)

          your hands --do you understand me?

          AGENT GRANT
          Yes sir!
          As Morgan hops up onto the moving chopper --

          MORGAN
          Nobody who works for me calls me sir.
          understand?! It's disingenuous -- might
          as well be calling me 'asshole.'
          As Grant watches the chopper take off, perplexed.

          EXT. MIDDLE OF NOWHERE - DAY

          An endless stretch of road lined with electrical line towers...
          Two FIGURES, like specks against the landscape -- Jerry and
          Rachel, walking, wet, cold. And then:

          RACHEL
          So you're a twin.

          (BEAT)
          Who works at a copy place.
          And she manages a clipped, judgemental (frankly rude) laugh.

          JERRY
          Yeah, I know... that's occurred to me.

          

          

          

          

          3/28/07 40.

          CONTINUED:

          RACHEL
          So this whole situation is obviously
          about him.

          JERRY
          Excuse me? I would offer this whole
          situation isn't "obviously" about
          anything.

          RACHEL
          Just think about it: you said your
          brother worked at the State Department --

          JERRY
          -- so what?

          RACHEL
          -- so that means he could've: been into
          anythinc -- he was a twin -:- you..received
          a shipment of weapons and cash and
          airplane manuals -- it seems to me that
          they sent the stuff to.the wrong brother--

          JERRY
          Wait a minute -- you're suggesting all
          that stuff was for Paul?
          As they approach TOWER 108:

          RAC HE L
          Hey, I'm sorry that he died, I'm not
          trying to insult his memory --

          JERRY
          he hasn't been dead long enough to
          become a memory! And if you knew Paul,
          which you did not, you'd laugh all day at
          the idea that he was a spy or terrorist
          or whatever you're implying --

          RACHEL
          I'm implying if not him... then why you?

          JERRY
          Well hasn't that been the question my
          whole life. You know how I know Paul
          wasn't a terrorist? Because if he had
          been, he would've been the best fucking
          terrorist in history: he wouldn't have
          gotten caught, the United States would be
          a crater -- he would've won awards for
          being a great terrorist.

          (THEN)
          What about you? Why'd she choose you --
          what's your day job? I know it isn't
          "manual-shift driver."

          

          

          

          

          3/28/07 41.

          CONTINUED: (2)

          RACHEL
          I did just fine driving, thanks. I'm a
          paralegal -- I have no connection to
          anything.

          JERRY
          Really?
          Suddenly they're interrupted by the ROOSTERTAIL OF DUST
          approaching in the distance. Rachel stops dead and on INSTINCT,
          grabs Jerry's hand, all their mutual hostility vanished:

          RACHEL
          Someone's coming.
          And what's approaching is the "Hassad DryCleaners." van. It
          comes to a stop and out steps the Middle Eastern Man. Stands
          some twenty-five feet from them.

          MIDDLE EASTERN MAN
          Are you Jerry Shaw?

          JERRY
          who are you?
           Rachel grabs Jerry's arm as the man reaches into his jacket --

           JERRY (CONT'D) MIDDLE EASTERN MAN
          -- Whoa -- I dropped it off like she
          said. I'm done.
          The man's pulled out an unusual-looking STEEL KEY.

          JERRY (CONT'D)
          -- dropped off what? Who are you?

          MIDDLE EASTERN MAN
          Take it --
          He TOSSES the key..-- it lands, LARGE IN FRAME, somewhere between
          them. Then:

          JERRY
          what's it for?

          MIDDLE EASTERN MAN
          I don't know -- I don't care -- but I
          will not drive you. You take the van
          (touches his EAR: beat)
          I'm not listening to you any more!
          And the man turns to go, just walks away.

          RACHEL JERRY
          -- hey! -- wait, who are you?! You
          have to tell us what you know!

          

          

          

          

          3/28/07 42

          CONTINUED: (3)
          And as the man walks away from them his CELL PHONE RINGS: He
          pulls it out -- the LCD READS: "LAST CHANCE." And the man
          DROPS the phone and just starts RUNNING --

          JERRY

          WAIT!!
          And Jerry takes off after him, he's not letting him go. Catches
          up to the guy and grabs him. Spinning him round --

          JERRY (CONT'D)
          What do you know?

          MIDDLE EASTERN MAN
          -- let me go!

          JERRY
          -- who's doing this?
          And they begin to struggle. Middle Eastern Man's dropped CELL
          PHONE RINGS. Rachel. Terrified, hesitant. Knows somehow its
          for her -- she answers:

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          Stop him now or he will die.

          RACHEL
          (looking around)
          How are you seeing us?!
          Jerry and the Middle Eastern Man. Fighting. Thrashing.
          Throwing sloppy punches:

          MIDDLE EASTERN MAN
          Let go of me!
          On Rachel:

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          Stop him now.
          CLICK. Rachel turning to SCREAM at Middle Eastern Man --

          RACHEL
          Stop! You have to STOP!
          When the Middle Eastern Man CRACKS Jerry in the nose and he goes
          sprawling. He takes off again, yelling back:

          MIDDLE EASTERN MAN
          I cannot! I have a family!!!

          RACHEL
          She's going to KILL YOU!

          

          

          

          

          3/28/07 43.

          CONTINUED: (4)
          And just then, something TERRIFYING: an IMMENSE POWER SURGE --
          HEARD, FELT -- and a SIX-STORY-HIGH COIL THE SIZE OF AN SUV
          EXPLODES IN SPARKS. CABLES BLAST FREE. Rachel SCREAMS. Jerry
          TACKLES HER TO SAFETY as the tree trunk cables SWING DOWN AND
          STRIKE THE MIDDLE EASTERN MAN and he is SLAMMED OFF HIS FEET,
          the current making the cable STICK TO HIM LIKE GLUE.
          And he's ON FIRE INSTANTLY -- SMOKE EVERYWHERE as he's TOSSED BY

          THE HORRIFYING TENTACLE, POUNDED INTO THE GROUND, BACK INTO THE

          AIR, PUMMELLED DOWN AGAIN, BURNING...
          Jerry and Rachel watch this in horror -- until she looks away.
           Jerry holding her -- the two in shock, strangers, in each -
           other's arms. Having shared another moment, too real, horror -

          RACHEL (CONT'D) JERRY.
          Oh my God... Oh God... oh We--we have to do something,
          God... Oh God... we have to... figure out what
          to.. what...
          And then his PHONE RINGS. And they're both too afraid to answer
          it. Another RING. And another. Finally Jerry answers it, hand
          shaking slightly:

          JERRY
          You killed him... you killed that man...

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          It was unavoidable. Take the van. Drive
           to Indianapolis. 7002 West 56th Street.
           Arrive no later than eleven AM. Disobey
           and you die.
          CLICK. Rachel's eyes on Jerry.

           JERRY RACHEL
          she wants us to drive to
          Indianapolis.: , -- why? What's there, what? --
          -- I don't know -- -- no, this can't keep
           happening! We have to go to
           the police, explain it --
           explain what?! What're we -- I'm not doing it!! I'm not
          gonna tell them?! going anywhere!
          Jerry can see she's losing it. Grabs her by the shoulders:

          JERRY
          -- Rachel. She's watching us. Right
          now. You wanna die too? Your son? We
          have to go.
          Rachel looks right at him, still shaking, knows he's right. And
          nods. Okay. Okay. As our MUSIC BUILDS, LARGER THAN YOU MIGHT

          THINK -- AND AT THE HEIGHT OF AN UNRESOLVED CHORD, IT --

          EXT. LANDSCAPE - DAY


          -- STOPS.
          Just the eerie, faint whistle of wind. We PAN a barren
          landscape. Scattered scorch marks. Then, a high-pitched TONE
          as the PAN continues and arrives at a parked military truck,
          which gives us scale to understand the SUDDEN COLOSSAL EXPLOSION

          THAT SHAKES OUR BEING -- HOLY FUCK THAT THING WAS HUGE AND AS

          DEBRIS IS STILL RIPPED INTO THE SKY, PIECES ARE COMING DOWN AND
          THERE WILL BE SMOKE FOR HOURS as a SUPER APPEARS:

          "BRIAR POINT TEST RANGE -- ABERDEEN, MARYLAND. "-
           And we hear CLAPPING -- PULL BACK, realizing that we are inside:

          INT. PROTECTIVE BARRACKS - DAY

          -- a high-tech bunker-like structure with six-inch LEXAN
          WINDOWS. A dozen MILITARY BRASS are here, applauding. Among
          them is Callister. He seems more thoughtful about this. Behind
          him, a British, DARK-SUITED WEAPONS';DEVELOPER speaks:

          WEAPONS DEVELOPER
          That blast was the result of one single
          crystal of Hexomethylne. For those of
          you who are new today, "Rex" is an
          isotope that leaves no chemical markers --
          it's eighty times more powerful than C4.
          Odorless. Undetectable.
          COLONEL THOMPSON, also from our opening, gestures:

          COLONEL THOMPSON
          Talk about the detonating system...
          The Developer screws a METAL VALVE into what looks like a can of
          compressed air, saying:

          WEAPONS DEVELOPER
          Hex is triggered by an acoustic frequency
          undetectable to the human ear. For this
          test we made it audible -- that was the
          tone you heard before the explosion --
          the tone was the trigger.

          CALLISTER
          What's the risk that another sound could
          accidentally detonate it?
          (half smile)
          A song on a radio? A howling dog?

          WEAPONS DEVELOPER
          No: the pitch is uniquely programmed and
          impossible to reproduce.

          INT. HALLWAY - PENTAGON - CONTINUOUS

          She turns a corner. DOWN THE HALLWAY a PHALANX of GENERALS,
          MILITARY PERSONNEL and SCURRYING ASSISTANTS heading towards a
          set of DOUBLE-DOORS. Some very big meeting about to happen -

          LATESHA
          That's the point. No one'll tell me. I
          cross-reffed the SCI database, talked to
          the Intel committee, NSA gave me..nothing.
          Krebs doesn't want me to ruffle any
          feathers. I've been up and down all the

          WHEN an MP suddenly appears and grabs her by the arm. Stopping
          her. He towers over her --

          MP
          Interns aren't allowed on this floor,
          miss. You'll have to --
          When Latesha wearily flashes him her I.D. I've got clearance,
          pal. He looks at it. Lets her arm go.

          -- sorry.

          CLICK. Latesha lowers the phone. A HUGE:PAINTING of the battle
          of EL-ALAMEIN looming behind her. Shelooks..back down the
          hallway as all the BRASS heading into the MEETING ROOM and
          catches sight of -- CALLISTER amongst them.

          He looks behind him briefly before being shuffled into the

          The van speeds down a highway, passing a sign: "WELCOME TO
          INDIANAPOLIS: YOUR HOME TOWN!" Jerry drives, pensive. Rachel
          stares out the-window, the shock of what she's seen only fueling
          her rage at the whole situation.

          JERRY
          how old is he? Your son.

          RACHEL
          (in no mood to share)
          Kyle. He's nine.

          JERRY
          What's he doing on a train?
          She really doesn't want to talk. BUT:

          He goes to a music magnet. His school's
          on a tour of Washington. They're playing
          at the Kennedy Center.

          JERRY
          wow. And you. Hm.
          She turns to him. Eyes burning into the side of his head.
          Knows what he's thinking.

          RACHEL
          Parents weren't allowed to go... is that
          okay with you?

          JERRY
          Is it okay? I could give a shit.

          RACHEL
          Then what's with the qualified nod?

          JERRY
          I'm not allowed to nod?

          RACHEL
          Not if you're iudging me.--

          JERRY.
          Judging?! I'm just making conversation.

          RACHEL
          You think I should have gone with him
          anyway.

          JERRY
          I'm just thinking, sounds like a big
          deal, especially for a 9-year-old --
          playing at the Kennedy Center -- I'd just
          think at least one parent might wanna be
          there to see it.

          RACHEL
          Yeah? How do you know Kyle's dad isn't
          there?

          JERRY
          Well, you're not wearing a ring and you
          haven't mentioned anyone but your son is
          on that train. Even the most pissed off
          ex-wife -- which I'm not saying you
          aren't -- would've mentioned it if her
          ex's life was threatened -- and if Kyle
          was going to meet his dad in DC? You
          would've tried to call him, too. So
          where is he? Kyle's dad?

          SCREECH! Jerry YANKS the wheel hard, PEELING across four lanes

          I'm sorry? What'd you just say?

          RACHEL
          I can't do this without you.

          JERRY
          You mean without the "man-child?"
          Rachel's reserves crumble.

          RACHEL
          Its the first time we've been apart, me
          and Kyle. Since the day he was born.
          And I let him get on that train--
          (almost whispering)
          -- I let him get on.
          Jerry sees all the panic and horror and guilt in this woman's
          eyes. They're both in pain. Points his finger right at her.

          JERRY
          No more accusing my brother of shit you
          know nothing about, is that understood?
          Rachel looks at him. Nods. Finding her voice again --

          EXT. TOWER 108 - DAY


          THE CHARRED FACE OF THE MIDDLE EASTERN MAN, FROZEN IN A SCREAM.
          Morgan runs towards it, the SHERIFF and a POWER WORKER trying to
          keep up. Chopper in B.G. Police officers work the scene.

          POWER WORKER
          Never seen anything like it. Power blew
          out from Franklin High School down to the
          river club. I can't explain it -
          They arrive at the body. Contorted, blackened, teeth bared.

          SHERIFF
          No I.D. We know he's male, though.
          Probably in his 20's.
          (points off)
          Tire treads entering and leaving the
          scene over three. Three sets of shoe
          prints.

          MORGAN
          And we're about 4 miles from the river --
          Just then we see Agent Grant running towards them, stumbling on
          some rocks. Just finishing-.up a cell call:

          AGENT GRANT
          Agent Morgan!"
          (out of breath, sotto)
          Just got off with HQ. The fake fax from
          Justice that got Shaw his phone call?
          Came from inside Justice.

          MORGAN
          Inside?! You absolutely sure on that?

          AGENT GRANT
          Yes, s--
          (catches himself)
          Yes I am.

          MEDICAL EXAMINER
          Got something --
          As the M.E. pulls something out of Middle Eastern Man's ear: a
          small, charred GIZMO. Small WIRE sticking out. Lifts it up for
          them to see. Morgan takes the TWEEZERS --

          GRANT
          Looks like a bone mic, military grade.

          Someone was talking to him.
          Something's rotten in Denmark. No, something's rotten
          everywhere. Morgan turns abruptly and starts back for the
          chopper. The Sheriff helplessly calls after him:

          SHERIFF
          We'll be needing that for evidence!

          EXT. 56TH STREET - DAY

          Jerry and Rachel's van pulls up to THE FEDERAL BANK OF
          INDIANAPOLIS. Across the way is a STADIUM for the COLTS. The
          parking lot's full, mid-game. They stare;.steeling themselves
          for the inevitable...

          RACHEL
          a Federal bank?

          JERRY
          Could be worse. Could.be.a Federal
          Prison.

          INT. INDIANAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE -;LOBBY - DAY

          A wall-mounted clock ticks to "11:00"--WHIP TO Jerry and Rachel
          entering. Security cams everywhere. As they nervously cross
          the floor, they pass TWO ARMED BRINKS COURIERS entering an
          elevator. A BANK MANAGER APPROACHES:

          MANAGER
          Mr. and Mrs. Saxon? I'm Mr. Bids. I
          understand you're in a hurry, why don't I
          show you to your box.

          JERRY
          (WHAT THE FUCK?! then:)
          yes, thank you, we'd... like that.
          The manager walks them across to a secure elevator with a
          THERMOGRAPHIC SCANNER. The manager looks at Jerry expectantly,
          waiting for him to place his hand on it. He does: a flash of
          light, identifying him as: "SAXON, CARL." Jerry's eyes: this is
          madness. The elevator doors OPEN.

          INT. INDIANAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE - VAULT - DAY

          They exit the elevator, the manager leads them to a DEPOSIT BOX.
          He pulls out a metal key, identical to the one the Middle
          Eastern Man gave Jerry:

          

          

          

          

          3/28/07 53.

          CONTINUED:

          MANAGER
          Your key?
          Jerry takes out his key, it fits perfectly. They turn; the box
          slides out, the manager lays it on a steel table. LEAVES to
          give them privacy. Jerry and Rachel stare at the box.

          RACHEL
          You gonna open it?

          JERRY
          Maybe it's not gonna be so bad.

          RACHEL
          Yeah... maybe it's something good..
          They meet eyes. Tentatively, he raises the lid to find TWO
          GLOCK PISTOLS and the same BONE MIC we saw.the.M.E. pull out of
          the Middle Eastern Man's ear. A note.: "EAR:MIC. NOW."

           JERRY RACHEL
          Oh, shit -- it's bad --
          They look at each other. Jerry puts the..mic in his ear:

          WOMAN'S VOICE OVER MIC
          Both guns are loaded, safety's off. In
          sixty seconds,':two,men Will exit the
          adjacent vault carrying a briefcase.
          Take it -- by force if necessary -- then
          exit the building..
          Jerry can't fucking believe this. Rachel dying to know:

          RACHEL
          -- what?!

          JERRY
          -- I don't suppose -- there's any easier
          way to`get whatever the hell it is you
          want -- is there? Miss?
          But she's not answering.

          The footsteps come CLOSER as two MEN appear... the.-BRINKS
          COURIERS from the lobby; one of them's carrying a METALLIC
          BRIEFCASE cuffed to his wrist -- the other spots Jerry's gun and
          REACTS, going for his gun:

          JERRY
          Don't!
          The men freeze -- Jerry holds his gun awkwardly --

           JERRY (CONT'D)
          Uh... hi. How's it going. Put. it on the
           floor. The briefcase. We don't wanna
           hurt you guys, we like you guys -- just --
          we need the case.

          COURIER #1
          You're bringing a shitstorm on your
          heads, you know that.

          JERRY
          I think we're already mid-shitstorm. Do
          it.
          The men exchange glances. Reluctantly, Courier #1 punches a
          combination into the case's padlock, the cuff POPS free from his
          wrist. He slides it over to Jerry, who reaches for it... AND
          COURIER #2 MAKES A MOVE -- SMASHING Jerry back, knocking the gun
          out of his hand.. Jerry CRASHES to the ground, the BONE MIC
          falling out of his ear... he turns, shit! Sees it skitter under
          the table. The Courier sees it too and grabs his chance:
          snatches up the case and RUNS for the elevator --
          Rachel rushes him, trips him -- he falls, dazed -- Jerry leaps
          up but Courier #2 effortlessly FLIPS him on top of the steel
          table, SLAMS Jerry's head into the counter, unholsters a back-up
          GUN from his ankle -- brings the barrel up as:
          BAM! A GUNSHOT! The Couriers spin to see RACHEL, holding the
          gun that was kicked across the floor:

          RACHEL

          DROP THE GUN ASSHOLE!
          Courier #2 drops it; Jerry rises, wipes blood from his lip.
          Rachel is fucking on fire, she's so tough. AKA: a mother.

          Alone in the elevator, Jerry looks down at the.. case, adrenaline
          coursing, sees a ribbon-thin DIGITAL TIMER near the handle:

          -- What do you mean you. don't
          know?!

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          You lost the mic, Jerry. That's not
          optimum.
          JESUS CHRIST! Her voice is in the elevator now:

          JERRY
          Would you stop doing that?!

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          There will thirty five seconds of
          disconnect, during which you need to get
          yourselves across the street to the
          stadium's VIP parking area unexposed.

          JERRY
          (calling out)
          Is this a bomb?! 'Cause I am not walking
          out with a bomb! Hey! You!
          But she's done talking. As the elevator DOORS SLIDE OPEN--

          INT. INDIANAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE - DAY

          TWO MORE BRINKS COURIERS wait by an armored truck. Jerry and
          Rachel exit, trying to look casual. Hearts POUNDING --

          RACHEL
          How do I look?

          JERRY
          Like you got into a fight. Me?

          RACHEL
          Like you lost one.
          AN ALARM SOUNDS. The men race into the bank as Jerry and Rachel
          walk RIGHT PAST them, starting across the street toward the
          stadium. No one in sight except a COLTS PARAPHERNALIA VENDOR.
          SQUAD CARS SCREECH in around the bank. COPS jump out drawing
          their weapons. Rachel tensing.

          JERRY
          Just keep walking
          Jerry looks at the CLOCK above the-stadium. Then over his
          shoulder at the BANK. Steers Rachel over towards the VENDOR.
          Trying to stay calm.

          JERRY (CONT'D)
          Two jerseys and two hats, please --

          VENDOR
          Peyton or Vinatieri?

          JERRY
          (shit!!!)
          I don't know what that means --

          RACHEL
          Jerry...

          JERRY
          (shit... shit...)
          Uh... both.
          The two COURIERS running out of the bank. POINTING RIGHT AT
          JERRY AND RACHEL ACROSS THE STREET. Everyone starts RUNNING
          TOWARD THEM. Jerry shoves a jersey and hat at Rachel--

           JERRY (CONT'D)
          Put these on --

          RACHEL

          JER--

          3/28/07 57

          CONTINUED:
          They put on the hats and jerseys, hurrying towards the stadium.
          Cops screaming at them to stop, the Vendor screaming that they
          didn't pay. The cops fan out. Cars SCREECH to a stop. Jerry,
          sweating. Flicks another look at the stadium clock: 3.. 2..

          1:

          WHEN WHAM! THE STADIUM DOORS FLY OPEN AS THOUSANDS OF JOYOUS

          COLTS FANS POUR OUT WEARING IDENTICAL BLUE HATS AND JERSEYS.
          The game's over. And in an instant, Jerry and Rachel are lost
          in a sea of blue and white -- it's impossible to spot them.
          Pushed back by the throng the COPS lose sight of them --
          Jerry takes Rachel's arm, working against the current towards
          the VIP parking area. A LIMO WAITING THERE. The CHAUFFEUR sees
          them, hurriedly puts down his paper. Opening the door --

          CHAUFFEUR
          Mr. and Mrs. Saxon? Hope you-enjoyed the
          game.

          JERRY
          Thanks, uh, we're in kind of a hurry --

          CHAUFFEUR
          I bet.
          Jerry reacts, confused by the.chauffeur's libidinous tone as he
          closes the back door. They vanish behind tinted windows as cops
          and agents pass right by them. And as the limo pulls out, we
          reveal, etched across the rear: "JUST MARRIED."

          EXT. HALLWAY - PENTAGON - DAY

          Latesha sits next to the DOUBLE DOORS. Laptop open, typing
          madly. She's been waiting a long, long time -- WHEN SUDDENLY
          they burst open and she SNAPS to her feet. Standing expectantly
          as GENERAL after GENERAL files out of the situation room. Each
          as tall and broad as the next --

          LATESHA
          (looking UP at them all)
          Afternoon... afternoon, sir...
          afternoon... afternoon, General...
          Pretty intimidating. Finally CALLISTER walks out, flanked by
          ADVISORS. The weight of the world's on his shoulders.

          LATESHA (CONT'D)
          Secretary Callister?
          He looks back, preoccupied. She catches up, holding her ID:

          LATESHA (CONT'D)
          Latesha Simms, DHS, level 2 clearance. I
          need to ask you a question, sir --

          

          

          

          

          3/28/07 58.

          CONTINUED:

          CALLISTER
          Not now, you can direct it to my office.

          LATESHA
          It'll only take a minute, sir, thirty
          seconds -- B-36? Can you tell me what it
          is? 'Cause its not --

          CALLISTER
          -- you don't have clearance, Agent Simms,
          and I don't have thirty seconds.

          LATESHA
          So should I assume it has something to. do
          with the four CVN class 21 aircraft
          carriers you and the president just
          ordered to the Strait of Hormuz -?
          He looks at her, stunned. How the hell--?

          LATESHA (CONT'D)
          I just checked the intel, sir, we have
          some of the same indexes --

          CALLISTER
          You need to stop assuming.
          And he moves on. Latesha gets jostled by all the brass, feeling
          like a mouse in cage filled with lions. Until she ROARS:

          LATESHA
          Secretary Callister.
          Voice echoing down the hail. Callister stops short, stunned by
          the gall and volume of this woman. She weaves through the
          GENERALS, planting herself in front of him:

          LATESHA (CONT'D)
          My Department's tracking a home-grown
          terrorist on the loose as we speak who
          may be connected to a cell with ties
          inside this building. Now seeing as you
          just had a meeting back there with more
          brass than the Navy Marching Band and
          with the terror threat rising every three
          hours, I'm going to just have to assume
          you're in the middle of a very delicate
          dance to stave off World War Three... so
          with all due respect, you either give me
          my thirty seconds and tell me what the
          hell B-36 is, or this world just fell
          into an even bigger heap of trouble.
          Sir.
          Callister looks down at her, completely struck dumb. She's hit
          a chord deep inside him. It's called balls. SLAM TO:

          INT. LOBBY - FOUR SEASONS HOTEL - DAY

          As Jerry and Rachel enter the POSH LOBBY of the FOUR SEASONS, an
          obsequious BELLHOP approaches -- he's been waiting for them:

          BELLHOP
          Mr. and Mrs. Saxon? This way, please --
          Tries to take the BRIEFCASE from Jerry, who yanks it back:

          JERRY
          No! 2 trot it.
          (forces a smile)
          Thanks, though.

          INT. PENTAGON - ANTE-CHAMBER - DAY

          Latesha dumps her things on a tray, moves through a scanner --
          among her items is a set of KEYS with aMINI.SWISS ARMY KNIFE.
          She's handed a NEW BADGE that reads: "TEMPORARY ACCESS."
          Ahead, an elevator door OPENS and we start CROSS CUTTING:

          INT. ELEVATOR - FOUR SEASONS - CONTINUOUS

          Jerry, Rachel, and the bellhop step in. The Hop hits
          "Penthouse." MUZAK. They travel up:

          BELLHOP
          So, where'd you two get hitched?

          JERRY RACHEL
          Reno. Niagara Falls.
          Shit.

          JERRY RACHEL
          Niagara Falls. Reno.
          Shit. The "DING" of an arriving elevator MATCHES US BACK TO:

          INT. PENTAGON ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

          THE LEVEL INDICATOR, having just arrived at floor "B-35."
          Latesha, wedged between two PENTAGON GUARDS, watches nervously
          as one of them uses a KEY to open a PANEL revealing:
          A BIOMETRIC SENSOR. The other guard holds his thumb to the
          scanner -- yet another PANEL OPENS, with a RED BUTTON marked "B-
          36." It hits Latesha: B-36 is a secret level in the Pentagon.
          The elevator DESCENDS to the final level and OPENS, revealing:

          INT. HONEYMOON SUITE - FOUR SEASONS - CONTINUOUS

          The Bellhop dramatically opens the door --

          BELLHOP
          Welcome to paradise.
          Palatial HONEYMOON SUITE. Picture windows, rose petals on the

          the TV
          He clicks a remote and a 72" PLASMA TV rises up from a cabinet.
          On screen, a narrated "virtual tour".of the hotel:

          Robes behind the door, jacuzzi with
          eighteen nozzles that hit in all the

          .Need anything, just dial zero, I'm here
          t2. serve, I'm here to please...
          And he stands by the door, waiting for a tip. Jerry's still
          looking aroundwhen Rachel catches his eye. Well? Oh. Jerry
          digs into his pocket and pulls out TWO NICKELS.

          JERRY
          Knock yourself out.
          The Bellhop is still looking down at his palm when Jerry SHUTS
          THE DOOR on him.

          RACHEL
          This is nice and everything, but what the

          He heads over to the minibar. Starts rooting through it,
          pulling out those tiny bottles of alcohol...

          JERRY
          If we're going down, I'm gonna go down

          RACHEL
          Can you stop eating for a second?
          A KNOCK at the door and they stop arguing immediately.

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          Answer it.
          They TURN hearing the voice: it's.coming from the T.V. The FOUR
          SEASONS GRAPHIC still dancing on screen.

          WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
          There are items you will need for the
          next step.
          KNOCK! KNOCK! A small nod from Rachel and Jerry opens the
          door. A DELIVERY BOY stands there with a BAG:

          DELIVERY BOY
          There y'go, Mr. Saxon. Have a nice day?
          Jerry takes the bag -- the kid puts out his hand for a tip just
          as Jerry closes the door on him, dazed. Starts pulling things
          from the bag: hair. dye, clothes...

          WOMAN'S VOICE
           The limousine is waiting for you
          `downstairs. You have 30 minutes to

          Your only consideration at present is to

          CLOSE ON HIS FACE in the panel's REFLECTIVE SURFACE --

          SCOTT
          Is he... blinking?
          Yes. Erratically, deliberately. Fucking weird. Scott and
          Latesha share a look. Suddenly, the image on the monitor starts
          to FLICKER and JUMP --

          ARIA. OVER SPEAKER (V.O.)
          I'm experiencing interference in network
          7752B, please allow me to shut down and
          analyze.

          SCOTT
          Negative, I'm prioritizing this.

          ARIA OVER SPEAKER (V.0.)
          I'll note my protest in the data log.
          This is getting weirder by the second -- PAUL'S DISTORTED
          REFLECTION in the panel, his eyes definitely blinking weirdly:

          LATESHA
          It's like he's trying to say something...

          SCOTT
          A code. He's blinking code

          LATESHA
          It's not Morse, but there's a sequence to
          it --

          SCOTT
          (then, a GRIN)
          Oh, that sonofabitch...
          He grabs a piece of paper and starts WRITING MADLY, scribbling
          numbers, scratching some out, then converting them to LETTERS --

          F... I.

          CONTINUED: (3)

          SCOTT (CONT'D)
          (as he works)
          It's a code -- Hexadecimal -- a number
          system that can be converted to letters
          the first computer used it as a
           programming language back in the 50's.
           Latesha watches, rapt: R... E. E... X... T. ."
           ON THE FEED: the elevator door OPENS and Paul steps out. That's
           all they get. They stare, trying to make sense of the letters:

          "F.. I. R... E... E.. X... T.. ."

           SCOTT (CONT'D
          The hell is that?
          Staring, minds spinning -- and suddenly.she puts.a FINGER
          between the two "E's." Dividing words.. And GETS IT:

          EXT. CORRIDOR - SECONDS LATER

          MOVING FAST together down the same corridor Paul went down.
          They turn a corner... and STOP DEAD:-
          A FIRE EXTINGUISHER is mounted on the wall.
          Latesha sees the placement of the CAMERAS caddy-corner to the
          intersecting hallways... and knows what Paul was doing:

          LATESHA
          It's the only spot in the hallway not
          covered by .the cameras.

          (LOW)::
          He was hiding something from her.
          A SHIFT to ARIA CAM confirms it: she can't see exactly what
          they're doin
          Latesha moves urgently to the extinguisher, starts examining it
          for something, anything... but finds NOTHING.

          LATESHA (CONT'D)
          I don't get it. He had to be saying
          'Fire Extinguisher.'
          Scott pulls a MAINTENANCE SHEET off the wall. Scans --

          SCOTT
          Maintenance replaced it yesterday.
          (scanning the sheet)
          This isn't right... they weren't supposed
          to do it til June.
          They lock eyes.

          She read the code too... where's
          'Recyling'?

          EXT. LIMO - DAY

          The limo glides through traffic. In back, Rachel's nodded off.
          Jerry watches her from across the limo, sketching something on a
          cocktail napkin... RACHEL'S FACE. It's a perfect, beautiful
          rendering. And we sense something in his look too--
          something's changed. As Rachel wakes with a start --

          RACHEL
          Hey -- sorry, I didn't mean to -- am I
          drooling? I bet I'm drooling. You
          didn't sleep?

          JERRY
          Night shifts. I'm used to.
          Rachel sits up, sees the napkin. Grins, surprised.

          RACHEL
          Wow, is that me?

          JERRY
          One of my only party tricks.

          RACHEL
          (truly impressed)
          It's really good.
          Jerry looks down at it, not used to having his work appreciated.
          Rachel, can see how deeply affected he was by what Aria said.
          It seems to make her feel uuiilty somehow... kinder...

          RACHEL (CONT'D)
          About what Aria said... I'm sorry.
          They're;starting to connect. He glances out the window...

          JERRY
          You have to understand, I wasn't his
          twin, I was more like his... little
          brother. Always trying to catch up. And
          you wouldn't believe how... nice he was
          to me. Teaching me things when we were
          kids, telling me how great I was. He was
          the only one who ever did.
          (almost smiles)
          Of course he was involved in some super
          secret National Security project. He was
          a superstar. He had a rocket strapped to
          his back. I'm the fuck-up.

          I wear it like a medal, like it actually
          means something... but the funny thing
          is? This is probably the most important
          thing I'll ever do. This. Right now.
          This completely insane journey or
          whatever it is. I'm actually needed in
          something, me. Jerry Shaw is required.
          But what am I thinking? I'll probably
          fuck this up, too --

          RACHEL
          You're being too hard on yourself--

          JERRY
          No. I'm not being hard enough. That's
          been the problem.
          They look at each other. A real moment for Jerry. A seismic
          shift in his life perspective. But then something catches his
          eye -- his look DARKENS. Out the window, a highway sign:
          "DAYTON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT." The driver's.tinted divider
          window lowers, he offers a folder.

          CHAUFFEUR
          Your passports and itinerary.
          Now Rachel's seen the airport. sign, too. Looks at Jerry...

          JERRY
          (to driver)
          Uh... could you give us a minute?
          The Chauffeur nods, the window RISES again. Heart pounding,
          Jerry grabs the briefcase and slides back the timer sheath to
          check the countdown: "00:15:36...00:15:35..."

          RACHEL
          You don't think --

          JERRY
          -- we know what she can do, she doesn't
          need us to crash a plane --

          RACHEL
          -- what if it's not about just one plane?
          They look at each other. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. What to do. When
          Rachel grabs the briefcase as the limo pulls curbside.

          RACHEL (CONT'D)
          I have more to lose in this. If anything
          happens to Kyle then my life's over
          anyway --
          But Jerry grabs her hand, taking the case.

          A LONG LOOK BETWEEN THEM. As they realize, this could be it.

          INT. DAYTON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS

          We FEEL the heightened state of alert. NATIONAL GUARDSMEN with
          M-16's scan the crowd. Jerry and Rachel enter, adrenaline
          pumping -- he opens the envelope to reveal two PASSPORTS with
          their photos, but the names "MARK and ALLISON ACKERMAN." JUST
          THEN Aria's VOICE comes over the P.A.:

          ARIA OVER P.A.
          Allison Ackerman, please pick up the
          white courtesy phone --
          They stop, hearing her. Rachel TENSES in this moment moves

          Go to the ticketing machine, you'll
          receive two tickets to Paris.

          RACHEL

          A chopper TOUCHES DOWN near a waiting contingent of AGENTS and

          Jerry and Rachel show their tickets and ID's to a TSA SCREENER,
          watching all the people on the X-ray line... families... kids...
          Jerry looks down at the case that could kill them all...

          Jerry nervously sets it on the conveyor belt, they pull off
          their shoes... watch the case move toward the mouth of the
          machine, then pass through the metal detector, catching a
          GLIMPSE of the X-RAY SCREEN... the briefcase glides into view...
          A STRANGE GLITCH as the screen fritzes, then normalizes
          revealing the contents: A HAIR DRYER AND DIRTY CLOTHES?! They
          notice the surveillance cam watching:

          RACHEL
          (a murmur)
          she changed the screen...
          The case comes off the conveyor, the TSA agent hands it back:

          Can't be too careful.

          JERRY
          (forces a smile)
          You're doing a great job.
          As they walk on, he checks the timer, 00:03:22... 00:03:21.. 11
          They pass a KIDS' BAND and their teacher, gathered around an

          MOVING WITH JERRY AND RACHEL -- past a wall made of THIRTY FLAT
          SCREEN MONITORS that form one massive NIKE ad of Lebron slam
          dunking -- at once, the screens CHANGE to spell out the words:

          GATE 17-C. THEY'RE THIRTEEN SECONDS BEHIND YOU.
          Jerry and Rachel streak towards 17-C as the screens RETURN TO

          Agent Grant and airport cops round the corner ahead -- our
          heroes veer past a FLASHING MESSAGE BOARD that changes:

          GET ON THE SLIDEWALK.
          They leap onto the SLIDEWALK which starts ACCELERATING as they
          run -- travellers gawk as Jerry and Rachel race by -- they reach
          the end but are going so fast.that they're JETTISONED off the
          conveyor, TUMBLING into passengers.
          Agents run onto the slidewalk but it SUDDENLY BRAKES, JERKING
          them off their feet -- they're LAUNCHED into the air, a domino-
          effect of crashing people.` Jerry and Rachel pull themselves up
          and run toward gate 17-C, another screen CHANGES:

          TAKE THE EMERGENCY EXIT.
          Above a door, the "EXIT" sign FLASHES UNNATURALLY -- the door
          automatically UNLOCKS -- they push through -- Morgan runs up,
          too late; the door's shut again. Sees an AIRPORT JANITOR --

          MORGAN (CONT'D)
          Open this NOW!
          The janitor quickly swipes his ID through the keycard scanner,

          THE BRIEFCASE travels onward, nearing Morgan -- he GOES for it --
          but a machine arm guiding luggage SWINGS LEFT, manipulated by

           RACHEL SNAGS IT -- HER POV -- TIMER: "00:01:10... 00:01:09..."
          As Jerry scrambles to her, the conveyor SHIFTS THEM to a
          different belt -- they're funneled through a HATCHWAY. Dazed by
          what he's just seen, Morgan scrambles for his walkie:

          airport cargo and shipping -- it CHANGES to read:

          They run for Row 18, find a crate with "FRAGILE" in BOLD RED --
          an ELECTRONIC LOCK on the crate descrambles -- the front of the

          Hand still trembling, Jerry reaches out... lifts the top to

          She finds his eyes, it calms her.

          RACHEL
          I haven't really done... a lotta drugs.

          JERRY
          I've never done 'em in a cargo container.
          Despite everything, she smiles at that. He reaches for the
          walkie and TURNS IT OFF. Shutting Aria out. For the first
          time, they're alone. He keeps her distracted:

          JERRY (CONT'D)
          Tell me something --

          RACHEL
          -- what?

          JERRY
          -- anything -- something personal,
          something you would rationally never tell
          a stranger like me

          RACHEL
          I don't know. : You're being sweet, but
          it's not working -

          JERRY
          -- where's you ex-husband? You didn't
          tell me before--

          RACHEL
          -- you're gonna distract me by bringing
          up my life's biggest mistake?

          JERRY
          -- how could it be your biggest mistake?
          You got Kyle out of it.

          RACHEL
          -- now you're gonna distract me by
          bringing up the one thing I'm most afraid
          of losing?!

          JERRY
          Where is he? Your ex-husband?

          RACHEL
          Jesus -- okay -- he's in the Wilmington
          Correctional Facility.

          Mail fraud? You married a -- mail
          fraudist? Or whatever?

          RACHEL
          He wasn't a criminal when I married him.

          JERRY
          So you're a good influence.
          And Rachel actually LAUGHS -- but just as quickly darkens.

          JERRY (CONT'D)
          Do you have a picture of Kyle?
          Rachel reaches back into her POCKET'. Pulling out a beat-up,
          crinkled, damp picture. Jerry shines the walkie's blue light:
          Kyle, holding his trumpet. One front tooth missing.

          RACHEL
          That tooth grew in. It'.s an.:'old picture--

          He plays the trumpet?,

          RACHEL
          He was born playing the trumpet.
          As the drug really starts to kick in, like a truth serum:

          RACHEL (CONT'D)
          Every year his dad forgets his birthday.
          I have to buy a present and pretend
          it's... from him.

          JERRY
          (his heart breaks for

          HER)
          Sorry... that sucks.

          EXT. OUTSIDE CRATE - CONTINUOUS

          A FORKLIFT rolls down the aisle to.the crate. The DRIVER picks
          it up, drives it out toward the tarmac. There, waiting, is a C-

          130 ARMY TRANSPORT PLANE...

          INT. DAYTON INTERNATIONAL. AIRPORT - TERMINAL - NIGHT

          It's ABSOLUTE CHAOS from all the grounded flights. Morgan,
          livid, nurses a GASH on his temple from the blow he took --
          strides through the airport with Grant:

          AGENT GRANT
          Halloway-Smith says the drug was
          experimental -- briefcase was on a time-
          lock to prevent corporate espionage,
          supposed to be delivered to one of their
          dabs by the time it zeroes out -- if it's
          not,: case opens, the drug gets ruined.

          MORGAN
          We sweep every cargo hold, every crate--
          He's cut short by the sound of ROARING TURBINES out the window
          they spin to see the C-130 taxiing down the runway...

          MORGAN (CONT'D)
          Goddammit! Why's that plane on the
          runway?!

          AGENT GRANT
          C-130, it's military... shit, they're

          on a computer, it's useless --

          INT. PENTAGON - MAINTENANCE AREA - DAY

          DEAFENING NOISE: blow torches, steam pipes, radios, and a huge
          CRUSHING SOUND coming from an INDUSTRIAL TRASH COMPACTOR as
          Pentagon detritus gets recycled.
          Latesha and Scott hurry in -- MOVING through quickly -- scanning
          -- when they SEE it: a forklift whirring towards the. compactor
          carrying a huge bin filled with old fire extinguishers.
          Hundreds of them, stem valves removed, ready to be.dumped.
          Scott and Latesha break into a RUN, skittering down stairs to
          the main floor. Running towards the forklift, waving wildly:

          LATESHA SCOTT
          Stop!! STOP! STOP!!
          But the forklift Operator can't hear them with the bright orange
          EARPLUGS in his ears. Speeds the forklift to the mouth of the
          compactor and dumps the extinguishers inside just as Scott and
          Latesha catch up and see the HUGE CRUSHING ARM of the compactor
          rumbling down to flatten everything'-
          The compactor Operator looks over as Scott and Latesha wave
          their IDS furiously and he punches a button to STOP the arm just
          three feet shy of crushing everything.

          LATESHA
          We have to look in there!
          Latesha starts climbing INTO the compactor

          COMPACTOR OPERATOR
          Lady, you can't do that!

          LATESHA
          The hell I can't! Come on!
          Shit. Scott has no choice but to follow her and climbs in,
          ducking low, the ARM frozen just feet above them. The
          compactor's foul, inches of industrial grease and crap and God-
          knows-what. They start wading through the extinguishers,
          turning them over, shaking them, looking inside--

          SCOTT
          Shit, there're hundreds of them...

          LATESHA
          keep looking, it's here...

          

          

          

          

          3/28/07 87

          CONTINUED:
          WHEN THE ARM. Moves. Just a fraction. The operator looks at
          the console: the hell? Latesha and Scott keep ploughing through
          the tanks as... THE ARM MOVES AGAIN. And this time Latesha
          heard it. Looks up. AND IT MOVES AGAIN. And now she sees the
          ubiquitous CAMERAS watching... ARIA...
          THE ARM STARTS COMING DOWN! Scott CRIES OUT! Grabs Latesha by
          the jacket and tumbles out of the COMPACTOR but not before
          Latesha sees something on an extinguisher and reaches back--

          SCOTT
          Latesha!
          -- grabbing the extinguisher as CRASH!! The ARM CRUSHES down as
          she snaps her hand back just in time. Turns the tank over and
          palms something, unnoticed by everyone.
          As the operator runs up to her, beside himself --

          OPERATOR
          I don't know what happened! It wouldn't
          stop!
          Latesha catches her breath, livid,a chill ripping through her.

          SCOTT
          -- you okay? Jesus
          (but her eyes are LOCKED
          on the Cameras)
          Latesha?

          LATESHA
          yeah. I need to get out of here.

          SCOTT
          Yes. Yes. Good idea. Come on --
          As they start walking out. Workers parting to let them through.
          As they head towards the exit, Latesha suddenly pulls Scott into

          THE--
          BATHROOM: slams the door and locks it.

          LATESHA
           Your girlfriend can't see us in here --
          Gimme your phone --

           SCOTT

           (STUNNED)
           What --?! My phone? What're you --
           When Latesha opens her hand and Scott sees a CELL SIM CARD:

           LATESHA
           He hid it under the valve. This is what
          Paul Shaw left for us --

          MAGNIFIED through a jeweler's monocle, a diamond.., as it comes
          into FOCUS, we realize it's actually one of the HEX CRYSTALS
          Aria maneuvered off the military test site. CAMERA MOVES around
          the JEWELER, revealing FOUR MORE crystals on his workbench.
          Behind him, a sign: ASHLAND & SONS. Says into a phone headset:

          JEWELER
          Unique stones, where're they from?
          And in response, ARIA -- ultra-friendly, so human it's chilling:

          Family heirlooms. Sorry for the rush but
          I really want my son to be able to give

          JEWELER
          Lucky girl. I think I have the perfect
          setting. She'll love it.

          ARIA ON PHONE
          Thank you for understanding. You know
          how mothers are, well do just about

          AGENT GRANT'S VOICE
          A shipment from D.O.D.'s ghost fleet went
          missing --

          EXT. SKIES ABOVE WASHINGTON - DUSK

          A HELICOPTER ERUPTS INTO VIEW, barreling toward THE PENTAGON.
          Up front beside the pilot is Morgan; Grant filling him in:

          AGENT GRANT
          -- they were moving experimental
          explosives from a testing facility in
          Aberdeen.

          MORGAN
          What do you mean, 'experimental?'

          AGENT GRANT
          Compound called 'Hex' -- some kinda weird
          crystals that detonate with a sonic
          trigger -- it disappeared too, few days
          ago.

          MORGAN
          You mean one Goddamned crystal that
          someone could put in their pocket?!
          (pulls off glasses)
          This is not good. This is not a
          coincidence. What about a trace?

          AGENT GRANT
          Computer log shows the diverted Hex was
          sent to an address in Virginia,.jewelry,
          shop called 'Ashland And Sons' - care
          of Jerry Shaw.
          Morgan puts his glasses back on and looks hard at Grant. Opens
          his mouth to give and order when--

          (cutting him off)
          -- I'm all over it. ''.
          Grant finally coming to his own when they're suddenly cut off by
          two ARMY BLACKHAWK CHOPPERS, door gunners at the ready:

          (over squawk box)
          Helo flight VY84X, you're in restricted
          US Military Airspace. Identify.

          Blackhawk flight, we're on a DHS pri-one
          mission to the Pentagon heliport. FAA
          will confirm, over.
          Morgan just wants to get the fuck down there -- finally:

          BLACKHAWK PILOT (V.0.)
          Roger, FAA confirms. We'll lead you in.
          As the Blackhawks dip toward the Pentagon, the pilot follows:

          CHOPPER PILOT
          (to Morgan)
          Sorry. State of the Union tonight,
          they're locking up the city.

          swinging in behind and closing fast.

          JERRY
          Fuck yourself!
          A BRIGHT FLASH from under the Harrier's wing as a missile
          LAUNCHES. Jerry hurtles down an EMBANKMENT as it explodes
          against the wall, shattering the Matrix's windows -- he fights
          to control the car, spots a TUNNEL running through a hill --
          GUNS the car into it as the jet BANKS HARD --

          INT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

          Halfway through, the Matrix SKIDS to a stop, cars swerve and
          honk -- DESCENDING DOWN INTO VIEW AT THE OTHER END OF THE TUNNEL
          AHEAD, COMES THE HARRIER. BLOCKING JERRY'S WAY OUT. All cars
          in the tunnel SCREECH as the drivers get out and RUN. The jet
          hovers a few feet off the ground just outside --

          THE HEAD'S UP DISPLAY: Aria calculates a FOUR INCH LEEWAY on
          either side of her wings -- INCHES forward into the tunnel,
          hovers unsteadily. The display goes INFRARED, LOCKS ON the car:
          another Sidewinder IGNITES, streaking down the tunnel towards
          Jerry who --
          REVERSES, spins the wheel -- the missile WHIPS PAST and
          annihilates several cars behind them, but now a FLAMING WALL
          blocks the other side of the tunnel. Blocked in.
          Sweat pours down Jerry's face as he looks into the. unmanned
          cockpit of the jet. Then. Hits the gas
          The Matrix SCREECHES forward towards the Jet, gaining speed and
          momentum as the last missile LAUNCHES -- Jerry' clenches the
          wheel, watching his life flash before him when he OPENS THE
          DOOR and rolls out of the car, hitting the'ground HARD as the
          missile BLOWS THE MATRIX TO PIECES.
          Jerry scrambles back as it cartwheels into the air and the
          chassis disintegrates -- and because. it's, RACING so fast, the
          motor's TORN LOOSE and rockets forward like a flaming
          projectile, revving at 6,000 rpm's, straight at:
          THE HARRIER, which doesn't have: timeto reverse fast enough in
          the confined space -- the motor SLAMS into the jet's nose cone,
          HAMMERING THE FRONT FUSELAGE.: Spins: the jet like a toy,
          upending it out of the tunnel,-ablinding, white-hot fireball
          as the JET EXPLODES! Jerry leaps behind an overturned car for
          shielding as flaming debris blows everywhichway...
          In the aftermath he. rises up, shellshocked. Holy. Fuck.

          EXT. HIGHWAY - VARIOUS - NIGHT

          As the fireball DISSIPATES into the sky, cars SCREECH to a halt

           WOMAN IN.PRIUS MAN

          towards -- THE ORCHESTRA. And he sees -- KYLE, sweet Kyle's
          face, that face he remembers from the picture and that footage
          in the tank room. And... HIS TRUMPET.

          AND TIME STANDS STILL AS JERRY SUDDENLY UNDERSTANDS EVERYTHING:

          JERRY

          Jerry SCREAMS and starts RUNNING FOR THE PODIUM -- AGENTS TACKLE
          the PRESIDENT, PEOPLE start SCREAMING... BAM BAM! Jerry's hit
          twice as he GRABS KYLE, knocking the trumpet from his hands...

          INT. PENTAGON - VARIOUS - CONTINUOUS

          Latesha's axe SMASHING DOWN into Aria's CPU. Sparks. She
          HAMMERS DOWN AGAIN -- AGAIN -- until the CPU bursts into FLAMES.

          INTERCUT WITH CALLISTER IN THE SECURE VAULT:
          The door opens with a HISS. He's free and --

          LATESHA
          Drops the axe. Sinks to her knees, utterly exhausted.

          INT. CAPITOL - THE MAIN FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

          MAYHEM. As Rachel runs to the terrified Kyle and scoops him up
          into her arms. Jerry's on the ground, bleeding... Ten agents
          pin him down... no sound now except for him trying to BREATHE...
          Rachel appears over him, crying, grabbing his hand:

          RACHEL
          Oh, god... HELP! SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP!!!
          JERRY'S POV: Rachel starts receding away from us, like we're
          descending into a well... until..her face become a point of
          light. And Jerry smiles. As 'everything turns...

          BLACK.
          HOLD... AND IT'S SILENT.;.. a distant ECHO... A TRUMPET... a
          familiar song... LOUIS ARMSTRONG... "What a Wonderful World."

          INT. RACHEL'S CAR - DAY

          LIGHT mottled through trees, reflects off the windshield.
          Driving, Rachel stares thoughtfully at the road. The music's
          coming from the radio. She glances over:
          KYLE sits beside her, hand out the window, dipping up and down
          against the countryside. She watches him, filled with love.

          MAN'S VOICE (PRE-LAP)
          it's the finding of this committee
          that your actions were consistent with
          national security guidelines...

          INT. PENTAGON COMMITTEE ROOM - DAY

          Latesha and Scott sit at a table, still bruised and cut up,
          facing members of a PENTAGON INVESTIGATIVE COMMITTEE:

          DEPUTY DIRECTOR
          However, in reviewing Aria's server logs,
          one last matter's come up.

          CONTINUED:

          DEPUTY DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
          It seems right before you destroyed her,
          she attempted to fragment her core and
          uplink to a public satellite network...
          did you see anything to corroborate that?

          LATESHA
          (glances at Scott)
          What... do you mean?

          DEPUTY DIRECTOR
          She tried to break herself into bits and
          download them into cyberspace... we
          think, in the hope of reconstituting.

          SCOTT
          She may have tried, but running her...
          subroutines alone would take 300: million
          desktop PC's all networked together.
          There's no single system out there with
          enough computing capacity. to"sustain her.
          The men share glances, satisfied with the answer.

          DEPUTY DIRECTOR
          Thank you both for your time.

          INT. PENTAGON HALLWAY - DAY

          Latesha and Scott exit the hearing, still shaken up from
          everything that's taken place. Stop and look at each other. An
          awkward, high school beat. So... I guess this is it:

          SCOTT
          So...

          LATESHA
          So...

          SCOTT
          Hey :you think I could have your... you

          KNOW
          And before he can even ask Latesha's written something down on a
          piece of paper. Hands it to him.

          LATESHA
          That's my address. I'm not using a cell
          phone anymore. Pick me up at eight.
          They smile at each other, Latesha's eyes catching a SURVEILLANCE
          CAMERA. A chill creeping down her spine. AS --

          INT. MICROCHIP FACTORY - DAY

          "What A Wonderful World" CONTINUES over a long assembly line of
          SILICON WAFERS on a conveyor belt. They move through airtight
          vaults, part of the microchip manufacturing process...

          different directions, spreading out into the WORLD...

          EXT. RACHEL'S APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY

          Kyle's birthday party: streamers, other kids, cake, ad hoc
          soccer game. Rachel cutting pieces of cake when --

          KYLE'S VOICE
          Jerry!
          She turns to see JERRY standing there. He's still got his
          scratches, arm in a SLING. It's the only real injury we can see
          and it'll heal. Kyle runs up to him and throwing his arms
          around his waist.

          JERRY
          Hey, little man!
          Locks eyes with Rachel. Her heart beating like a drum, happier
          to see him then she'd ever imagine. And. Jerry holds up a
          present for Kyle.

          JERRY (CONT'D).
          Sorry I'm late, this was hard to find --
          Rachel's eyes well. She pulls it back. Manages to say:

          RACHEL
          Kyle. What do you say?

          KYLE
          I dunno, I haven't opened it yet.

          RACHEL
          (rolls her eyes, grins)
          Who brought you up?
          Kyle rips open the present to find a brand new PLAYSTATION 3.

          KYLE
          They're on backorder everywhere! Mom --
          can I go play with it?

          RACHEL
          One hour. That's it...
          As Kyle tears off with his friends, Jerry walks over to her.
          It's like everyone else at the party has disappeared...

          RACHEL (CONT'D)
          (almost a whisper)
          you remembered...

          RACHEL

          (SWEETLY)
          Yeah.

          I wantihwtit.

          RACHEL
          You know what? Me too.
          They smile at each other, like they have an enormous secret. He
          tucks a loose hair behind her ear.,..,

          JERRY
          And I think... I finally know what I
          want.
          And we see in her eyes, she feels the same about him...

          RACHEL
          I owe you, Jerry. Everything. I don't
          think you understand --

          JERRY

          (PLAYFULLY)
          Hey: shh. Officially we can't talk about
          it, remember?

          RACHEL
          Right. Or even about how we met.

          (SHRUGS)
          So what do we tell people?
          He thinks about it. Smiles...

          JERRY

          Rachel LAUGHS, giving him a playful push as we CUT TO:

          INT. RACHEL'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

          Kyle turns on the TV, eagerly plugging in the Playstation -- we
          catch a snippet of the NEWS: CALLISTER being sworn in in front
          of a CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW COMMITTEE --

          NEWS ANCHOR
          sources inside the beltway say the
          Senate is convening an investigative
          committee to look into what could very
          well become the biggest cover-up since --
          Oblivious, Kyle flips on the video game and the screen CHANGES
          to the Playstation logo. The kids CHEER, they can't wait... but
          the screen fritzes and goes BLANK...

          FRIENDS
          Aw, what the hell?! It's broken!
          A prompt appears with a BLINKING CURSOR. Then... words scroll:

          "HELLO, KYLE..."
          The kids look at him, confused. Kind of freaked out. Kyle
          stares at the screen, eyes riveted, his breathing quickens.
          CLOSE: THE CURSOR -- blinking like a beating heart and we:

          SLAM TO BLACK.



          THE END
