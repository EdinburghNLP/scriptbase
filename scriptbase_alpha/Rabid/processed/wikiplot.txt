A critically injured woman, victim of a motorcycle accident, is taken to the plastic surgery clinic of Doctor Dan Keloid, where some of her intact tissue is treated to become morphogenetically neutral.
The tissue is grafted to fire-damaged areas of her body in the hope that it will differentiate and replace the damaged skin and organs.

The woman's body unexpectedly accepts the transplants, developing an orifice under an armpit, within which hides a phallic stinger.
She uses it to feed on the blood of other people and afterwards erasing their memories of the incident.

It soon is apparent that every victim whom she infects transforms into a rabid zombie whose bite spreads the disease.
This eventually causes the city to fall into chaos before the outbreak can be contained.
