           Celeste is a chronic overachiever and Jesse is sweet, goofy
           and funny. He makes her laugh. They are best friends but it's
           clear that Jesse wishes they were more.

           Jesse watches enviously from the sidelines, holding Mike's
           helmet.

          2 INT. TOYOTA PRIUS-DAY 2
                         
           It's a bright, clear Los Angeles Saturday afternoon. Celeste
           and Jesse, now 30, both sing along to "Love Rhino," the song
           heard under the montage. Jesse drives while Celeste is on her
           Blackberry. Jesse, boyishly handsome, wears an old tee and a
           hooded sweatshirt. Celeste is wearing all black workout
           gear. She is always wearing all black.
                         
                          JESSE
           I'm a Love Rhino...
                         
                          CELESTE JESSE
           Don't worry `bout me, I've Dont' worry `bout me, I've
           got a enough love for got enough love, for the two
           the...(her Blackberry rings) us. Oh please...
           oh shit, I gotta take this.
           Turn it down.
                         
           JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           ...I'm a Love...
                         
                          CELESTE
           Jess, turn it down, seriously!
                         
           She playfully slaps him. He turns it down. A little.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Hello? Hi. With Jesse, running
           errands. (to Jesse) Turn it down.
           More. (back to the phone) Yeah, I
           can do it now. No, it'll be fast,
           right? (To Jesse) Hey, I have to
           give a quick sound bite for the New
           York Times, so no noise please? For
           a second?
                         
                          JESSE
           Maybe. I may have an important call
           coming in too, so...
                         
           They both know he has no important call coming in.
                         
                          CELESTE
           (on the phone) Okay. Ready? This
           year all trends point towards
           simplicity and comfort.
                         
           Celeste is momentarily distracted by a bad driver in front of
           them.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Jess, just go around him! (To the
           phone) Sorry.
                          (MORE)
           3.

           Consumers will be less likely to go
           out for entertainment.
                         
          While Celeste is dictating, Jesse is getting bored. He starts
          looking through the middle console. He finds something. A
          melted tube of Chapstick. Ew. Ooh, a cigarette. Jesse lights
          the cigarette, takes a drag. Celeste looks at Jesse and
          signals to him, "Can I have a drag?"
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Uhhh, things like Voodoo, casual
           wear and cookbooks will see a huge
           spike in the market.
                         
          He hands her the cigarette and she promptly chucks it out the
          window.
                         
                          JESSE
           What the shit??
                         
                          CELESTE
           (she whispers to Jesse) Shhh. Phone
           call.(back to her call) That's
           enough of a blurb, right?
                         
          Jesse is now checking out nose hairs in the visor mirror. He
          then looks at his teeth.
                         
                          JESSE
           Does this tooth look dark?
                         
          Celeste just glares at him.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Okay. Call me back if they need
           more.
                         
          Jesse looks at his tooth again in the rearview mirror.
                         
                          JESSE
           Like a little darker than the rest?
                         
          Celeste waves her hand to quiet Jesse.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Okay, thanks bye. (to Jesse) Can't
           you just sit still for two minutes?
           And we talked about this, no more
           smoking!
                         
                          JESSE
           I wasn't smoking, I just found it.
           4.
                         
                         
                          CELESTE
           Come on.
                         
           They drive by "Urban Light," Chris Burden's installation at
           the entrance of LACMA. They are rows of restored street
           lamps. Celeste sneers.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Really? Street lamps? No. Not doin'
           it. That is not art.
                         
                          JESSE
           I think it's beautiful.
                         
           A beat passes. Then, Jesse pulls over.
                         
                          CELESTE
           What are you doing? Why are you
           stopping?
                         
                          JESSE
           Well, your appointment is not until
           noon and this is that place with
           the deadstock vintage Italian
           fabric. I thought it would be good
           for the guest room windows.
                         
           Celeste is truly touched by the gesture.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Oh wow...you are so thoughtful.
                         
           Jesse smiles, proud of himself.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Thanks, Jess.
                         
           She gives him a kiss on the cheek. Jesse's phone rings, he
           answers.
                         
                          JESSE
           Whassup, muthafucka??
                         
           Celeste rolls her eyes and gets out of the car to look at
           fabric.

                          CELESTE
           Jess, that place is insane. They
           have tassels that were manufactured
           for Mussolini's mistress...
                         
                          JESSE
           (covering the phone) Sorry, I'm on
           the phone. It's important.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Okay then.
                         
          Celeste sits quietly while Jesse is on his call.
                         
                          JESSE
           Really? I just...don't know what to
           say. Thank you so much for calling
           me.
                         
          Celeste throws her hands up in silent celebration.
                         
                          CELESTE
           (whispers) Did you get the job??
                         
          Jesse signals with his finger, "one minute."
                         
                          JESSE
           Well, sometimes things are just
           meant to work out.
                         
          Celeste looks at him with anticipation.
                         
           JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Okay, great. Great. Talk soon. Bye.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Was that the job? Did you get the
           book job?
                         
                          JESSE
           No, but Celeste...
                         
          He looks at her and grabs her hand, with tears in his eyes.

           it's glassy.

          Is this about surfing? You're
          talking about going surfing.
          Unbelievable.
                         
                          JESSE
          No, this is best part. Skillz got a

          gonna film me!!!

          Oh, god.

          I'm not...
                         
                          JESSE
          What? Is that not awesome?
                         
                          CELESTE
          No, yeah, I just thought it was
          about the Slate job you interviewed
          for.
                         
                          JESSE
          Oh yeah. No. They haven't called
          yet. But if they don't think I'm
          the right artist to illustrate the
          book, then it's not the right job
          for me. You know what I mean?
                         
                          CELESTE
          I absolutely do, yes. You are a
          wonderful artist. But at some
          point, you will show the world that
          one day...right?
                         
                          JESSE
          Hey, can I drop you at home now?
          Because I just missed a wave.
                         
                          CELESTE
          Well...
                         
                          JESSE
          Wait! I just missed another one.
           7.

           Jesse is dropping Celeste at home.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Be back by six so you can shower.
                         
                          JESSE
           Why shower?
                         
                          CELESTE

           Aw, so wrong.
                         
                          CELESTE

           He promptly blasts the radio and flashes their signature "C
           and J" hand sign. She flashes it back. He zooms off.

           Celeste and Jesse are on double date with BETH, 30, petite,
           and full of energy and TUCKER, 31, preppy in an indy way.
           These are their best friends from college. They're engaged.
                         
                          TUCKER
           Did you end up going to see that
           band at Spaceland last week?
                         
                          JESSE
           Oh, The Injured Saint? Yeah, dude.
           They are real. You know what? They
           should be your wedding band.

           They're loud but they're
           affordable.
                         
                          CELESTE
           They opened for Darcy Fudged His
           Knickers. Now, they're amazing.
           You'd be lucky to book them for
           your wedding. Or you should see if
           Emergency Breakthrough is
           available. The horn section is
           tight.
                         
                          BETH
           It's already done. We got the best
           swing band in New England.
           Sugarfoot and The Swingin' Scrod.
                         
                          TUCKER
           I told you, I'm not doing it. Swing
           is so late 90's, honey.
                         
          Beth leans over a gives him a deep kiss. She knows how to
          work him.
                         
                          BETH
           I love you. We'll talk about this
           later.
                         
          Celeste looks over the menu. Celeste and Jesse's next
          interaction is said with heavy, really bad German accents,
          which is hilarious--only to them.

          Celeste and Jesse giggle at their stupid inside joke for a
          little too long. Then, there is a deafening lull in the
          conversation. Beth is buttering a piece of bread. She loudly
          drops the knife on her plate and buries her head in her
          hands.
                         
                          BETH
           I can't do this. I just can't.
                         
          Celeste is genuinely concerned about her friend.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Are you okay? Oh no...

           It's just not right. I can't hold
           my tongue. We can't do this
           anymore.
                         
                          CELESTE

           NO. WE are fine. What the fuck are
           YOU TWO doing??
                         
          Jesse and Celeste look at Beth in amazement.
                         
                          CELESTE
           What do you mean?

           Yeah, what do you mean?
                         
                          BETH
           What do I mean?? You guys are not
           together anymore! This is not
           normal! You've been separated for
           SIX MONTHS and you hang out every
           day like nothing's wrong! It's

           No, Tucker, you think it's weird
           too. Speak up for yourself.
                         
                          TUCKER
           It's weird. Let's not play charades

           No charades. We are separated and
           we're friends. You guys should be
           happy, all we did was fight before.
                         
                          JESSE
           Yeah, you guys should be thrilled
           about this. You'll never have to
           pick sides.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Yeah, everyone's cool.
                         
                          BETH
           Everyone is not cool! This is not
           cool! It's just not working for
           me, I'm sorry.
                         
           Beth gets up and walks out. Celeste and Jesse sit there and
           stare at Tucker in silence.
                         
                          JESSE

                          TUCKER
           Yeah, you guys are weird. I can't
           do this. It's fucked up.
                         
           Tucker gets up and leaves. Jesse and Celeste watch him leave
           and sip their wine quietly.
                         
                         
          6 INT. TOYOTA PRIUS-NIGHT-LATER 6
                         
           Celeste drives and Jesse is in the passenger seat. He has a
           tube of Vaseline Lip Therapy. He is stroking it rapidly as if
           it were a penis. This is not the first time.
                         
                          JESSE
           C, look...uhhhh!
                         
           Celeste looks at him. She joins in. She reaches over and
           pushes in on the tube. Vaseline comes out of the top. This
           looks a lot like a penis ejaculating.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Ahhhhh! Oh god!
                         
           They both erupt in laughter. Even though this is the
           thousandth time they've done this stupid joke, it will always
           be funny. To them.

                          CELESTE
           It's not weird that we hang out.
           Do you think it's weird we hang
           out?
                         
                          JESSE
           No, of course not. You're my best
           friend.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Yeah you too. I mean, we can't not
           hang out. The last time we didn't
           talk for longer than a week was in
           10th grade when you went to Space
           Camp Canada.
                         
                          JESSE
           Yeah, that was 6 weeks of torture.
           I mean, the anti-gravity training
           was insane but I missed you.

           Celeste and Jesse stand in the driveway of Celeste's house.
           There is a bit of a linger.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Well, I'm exhausted.
                         
                          JESSE
           Me too.
                         
           Celeste walks to her front door with her key and Jesse heads
           towards the side gate with his key. It is now obvious that he
           is living in her guest house.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Hey, it's kinda chilly tonight,

                          JESSE
           Oh, it's fine. I'm fine.
                         
           He keeps walking. He turns again to Celeste.

           Jesse, please, you can stay here as

           to have you here.

           Oh, don't forget, the contractor
           needs to get in there for
           measurements in the morning. So
           make sure your thingys, your

          8 INT. CELESTE'S HOUSE-MORNING 8
                         
           Celeste's morning symphony is under way. She sits in front of
           a bowl of oatmeal, a bowl of berries, a cup of coffee, 4
           neatly stacked newspapers, her laptop and the television
           tuned to CNN. She methodically eats, sips her coffee, reads
           the paper, watches TV, and surfs the internet. She is clearly
           a culture vulture. Jesse walks by outside his studio and does
           the "C and J" sign to Celeste. She does it back
           instinctively. Is it weird that we hang out so much? She
           shakes it off and titters. She's being ridiculous; it's fine.
                         
                         
          9 INT. COFFEE BEAN- MORNING 9
                         
           Celeste walks in, dressed impeccably. Again, in all black.
           She is in a rush, on her Blackberry, bombarded with a hefty
           pre-work crowd. People are in some semblance of a line,
           waiting to order.
           13.
                         
                         
          Celeste spots a man in a business suit, taking advantage of
          the confusion and cutting in front of a woman at the head of
          the line. He orders.
                         
                          BUSINESS MAN

           Excuse me, sir?
                         
          The business man pretends to not hear her.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Sir? You?
                         
          She taps him on the arm. He turns around.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           You do realize that you just cut in
           front of a lot of people.
                         
                          BUSINESS MAN
           Oh. Sorry, I didn't know.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Did you not?
                         
                          BUSINESS MAN
           I'm in a rush.
                         
                          CELESTE
           So you did know. And everyone's in
           a rush, so...
                         
          Other people in line are now paying attention. Celeste wants
          to let it go, but she can't.
                         
                          BUSINESS MAN
           Well, she was looking at the
           pastries, I didn't think she was
           ready to order.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Well, it's not just her. It's
           everyone behind her too. So, if you
           want to ask all these people if
           it's okay to cut in front of them
           because you are late, be my guest.
           Just don't assume that your time is
           more important than everyone
           else's.

                          CELESTE
           American culture is dying. We have
           an unrelenting appetite for
           processed junk food, talentless pop
           stars like Riley Banks and recycled
           movie franchises like Transformers.
           The more we consume crap, the more
           we want crap.

                          RACHEL MADDOW
           Sounds utterly hopeless. Is there
           an upshot?
                         
                          CELESTE
           I think there will be a groundswell
           movement towards simplicity.
           People will start to listen to
           their most rudimentary needs-- they
           will crave mental, spiritual and
           physical nourishment. It's back to
           basics.
                         
                          RACHEL MADDOW
           Wow, a lot to chew on. Well, thanks
           for being with us today. You're
           great, come back any time. For more

          12 INT. SCOTT'S OFFICE-AFTERNOON 12
                         
           SCOTT, 40, Celeste's partner, gay but very straight, sharply
           dressed and bespectacled, sits at his desk. Celeste enters.
                         
                          CELESTE
           So I had dinner with the drama club
           last night.
                         
                          SCOTT
           Who's that?
                         
                          CELESTE
           Tucker and Beth. They're such
           dicks. They left in protest because
           they think Jesse and I are being
           "unhealthy." So judgy, right? We're
           fine.
                         
                          SCOTT
           You're only done when you're done.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Spare me the spiritual platitudes,
           Scotty. If we were gay,(she motions
           to Scott) no one would even
           question us being friends!
                         
                          SCOTT
           You and Jesse are clearly not ready
           to let each other go. And there's
           nothing wrong with that.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Yeah there's nothing wrong with
           that. I mean, what do you think?
                         
                          SCOTT
           Well, to be honest...
                         
           Celeste looks at an e-mail her blackberry and interrupts.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Wait, we're signing Riley Banks??
           When were you going to tell me?? I
           just trashed her on Rachel Maddow.
           Great.
           16.
                         
                         
                          SCOTT
           Yeah, that's why I wanted you to
           come in. It's a huge account..
                         
                          CELESTE
           Scott, you and I built this company
           so we wouldn't have to take an
           account like Riley Banks.
                         
                          SCOTT
           Well, you and I may not have a
           company if we don't take Riley
           Banks. Recession, remember?
                         
                          CELESTE
           She's like a...soul-less hologram.
                         
                          SCOTT
           She is releasing a new album. She
           wants us to do the branding and
           merchandising. We need to take this
           account.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Ok. Fine. I'm gonna go eat lunch.
                         
          Celeste starts to heads out.
                         
                          SCOTT
           If you are looking for my opinion,
           I do think you should start dating.
                         
                          CELESTE
           I don't do dating. The right guy
           will show up. And I'm still on
           track for my 25 year plan.
                         
                          SCOTT
           No one has a 25 year plan. Except
           for my mortgage company.

           First child at 33. Second at 35.
           Which means I will only be 56 at my
           eldest's college graduation. The
           bad news is that I may not be at my
           4th grandchild's high school
           graduation. But that's okay, I
           guess.
                         
                          SCOTT

           I've got time. I'm not worried.
                         
                          SCOTT
           Well, do me a favor and get your
           fuck on before you meet the next
           guy.
                         
           Celeste looks at Scott in shock.
                         
                          CELESTE
           What are you doing?

           Sorry, I was trying to be your
           saucy gay friend. It didn't feel
           good.

           Jesse and SKILLZ, 32, another man-boy, in hip-hop gear, wait
           in a very, very long line of very, very hip people at LA's
           trendiest new yogurt place.
                         
                          SKILLZ
           The economic climate is real bad,
           man. And I think my business is
           taking the hardest hit of all. It's
           brutal. And no one's talking about
           it.
                         
                          JESSE
           You sell pot.
                         
                          SKILLZ
           Not for long, dude. Have you been
           to those weed pharmacies? They're
           killing me. I gotta branch out.
           Maybe start working in
           methamphetamines? Or maybe teach
           pre-school. I always wanted to do
           that. I love kids.
                         
           Skillz is distracted by something.
                         
           SKILLZ (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Sorry, I know this is serious talky
           time but would you look at the
           fucking seat on that girl?
           18.
                         
                         
          We see a girl's apple bottom butt stuffed into blue jeans.
                         
           SKILLZ (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           THAT is a party.
                         
          Jesse does not laugh. He looks like he is in pain.
                         
                          JESSE
           I don't think it's over.
                         
                          SKILLZ
           What? Her butt? No, it will never
           be over. It goes on forever. It's
           like space. So great.
                         
                          JESSE
           No, Celeste and I. I think she's
           just confused and overwhelmed right
           now about everything. But she'll
           come around. She always does.
                         
                          SKILLZ
           Uh oh. It's been a while now. I
           think it's over, bro. It may be
           time to accept that and move on.
           Call that dime Veronica.
                         
          Jesse looks uncomfortable.
                         
                          JESSE
           That was a one time thing, a couple
           months after Celeste and I broke
           up. Celeste does not know about
           that. And we will keep it that
           way.
                         
                          SKILLZ
           Didn't know that was a hit and run.
           Sounded like you liked her.
                         
                          JESSE
           Well, she's not Celeste. It's
           always been Celeste. I'm not ready
           to give up.
                         
                          SKILLZ
           Okay, but remember, you can't re-
           heat a souffle.
                         
                          JESSE
           Huh?

                          SKILLZ
           Also, there's Bettys everywhere.
           It's LA. Maybe it's good to remind
           Celeste that you can pull wool.
           Make her sweat a little bit.
                         
                          JESSE
           It definitely wouldn't hurt to...go
           out with somebody.
                         
           They reach the front of the line.

                          JESSE
           Yeah, I want to not be a quitter. I
           don't want to start all over again.
           I want everything that I believed
           to have been true to be true. I
           also want a goji berry/green tea
           swirl with yogurt chips and Fruity

           guys are here like everyday
           together.
                         
                          JESSE
           Well...we're separated.
                         
                          YOGURT GIRL
           Oh. Cool. I mean, bummer. But okay.
           I'll go.
                         
                         
          14 INT. LACMA-LATE AFTERNOON 14
                         
           Celeste and Beth wander amidst the modern art. They stop to
           take in a Cindy Sherman photo.
                         
                          BETH
           It's so...grotesque.
                         
                          CELESTE
           But kind of beautiful. In a
           grotesque way.
           20.
                         
                         
                          BETH
           Ugh, let's keep moving. Too many
           feelings.
                         
          Celeste and Beth wander to the wall and stare at a Damien
          Hirst collage.
                         
           BETH (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           I need to say this and then I'll
           never bring it up again. I'm sorry
           I wigged on you guys the other
           night but I don't know what you're
           doing. I think it's stupid that
           you're not together. You are best
           friends and that's the hard part.
           Nothing else matters.
                         
          Celeste and Beth stand in silence. Then:
                         
                          CELESTE
           Beth, the reality is I love Jesse
           dearly but he doesn't have a
           checking account. Or dress shoes.
           The father of my children will have
           a car. But...Jesse will always be
           my best friend.
                         
                          BETH
           Okay fine. I've said my peace. It's
           your life. But I definitely don't
           think he should be living in your
           guest house. I think you're kind of
           breaking his heart. Slowly.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Jesse is fine.
                         
                          BETH
           Can I show you something?
                         
                          CELESTE
           Sure.
                         
          Beth suddenly pulls Celeste into a corner. With no art.
                         
                          BETH
           Okay. Look.
                         
          She points to her neck.
                         
                          CELESTE
           What am I looking at?
           21.
                         
                         
                          BETH
           It's a hair. On my NECK.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Ewww. Will you get that thing
           lasered off, please? What the fuck?
                         
                          BETH
           I can't because it will pop up
           somewhere else where I can't keep
           my eye on it.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Are you serious? That's the
           craziest thing I've ever heard.
           It's not a turnip.
                         
                          BETH
           Trust me, I know my body. It's a
           cruel land mine.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Okay, well at least pluck it for
           Chrissake.
                         
                          BETH
           I should, at least before my
           wedding, right?
                         
                          CELESTE
           What is wrong with you?
                         
          Celeste grabs the hair and pulls it out.
                         
                          BETH
           (in pain) AHHHHHHHHHH!
                         
          A security guard heads for them.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Sorry sir, my friend has a really
           strong emotional reaction to modern
           art.
                         
                          BETH
           That was fucking rude.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Had to be done.
           22.
                         
                         
          15 EXT. JESSE'S STUDIO-EARLY EVENING 15
                         
           The studio is beautifully, magically chaotic. There are
           large canvasses everywhere, paint rags, spray cans, common
           household items turned into sculptures (buttons, clothespin,
           hangers) and mobiles. Celeste walks in. Jesse is on a
           mattress on the floor, he's clearly been sitting there for a
           while. He is fist-deep in a huge bag of Cheetos and he's
           watching the 2008 Beijing Olympics on Tivo. He is watching a
           short feature about Olympian Matthias Steiner, a gold
           medalist in weight lifting.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Hey...you're not working? Are you
           watching the Olympics? Again? And
           crying? Again?
                         
           Jesse blows his nose.
                         
                          JESSE
           Yeah.
                         
                          CELESTE
           God, you really love that, don't
           you?
                         
                          JESSE
           Matthias' wife died in a car
           accident last year.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Well, three years ago now but...
                         
                          JESSE
           And he dedicated his gold medal to
           her. The human spirit
           is...unbreakable.
                         
           Jesse is choked up, can barely speak.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Uh huh. Hey, did you finish that
           artwork for the Pop Form website?
                         
                          JESSE
           Huh? Oh yeah, I'm almost done. I'm
           working on it. I think you'll
           really like it.
                         
                          CELESTE
           I'll like it more when I have it
           because I needed it yesterday,
           so...
           23.
                         
                         
          Jesse turns off the television, takes a deep breath, wipes
          his eyes and recovers.
                         
                          JESSE
           Celeste, can you sit down for a
           minute? I have something really
           important to tell you.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Oh. Okay. Does it have something to
           do with the work you owe me?
                         
          Celeste sits. Jesse sits next to her. Again, he has tears in
          his eyes.
                         
                          JESSE
           I don't know how to tell you this
           but...I have a date tonight. I'm
           gonna start dating. People.
                         
                          CELESTE
           A date? Really? That is so great.
                         
                          JESSE
           It is? You don't...
                         
                          CELESTE
           Yeah! Don't cry. Good for you,
           Jess.
                         
                          JESSE
           That doesn't bother you? Wow, okay.
           Well, it's actually the Yogurt
           Girl. From Yoga Yurt?
                         
                          CELESTE
           Really? Yogurt Girl, huh. She's
           cute! But so young, right?
                         
                          JESSE
           Super young. Her body is all-time.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Okay, no need for that. But this is
           good! You gotta crawl before you
           walk. I mean she's definitely not
           gonna be wifey number two, right?
           Ha.
                         
                          JESSE
           Well, it's just a date.
                         
          She hugs him in an unconsciously patronizing way.
           24.
                         
                         
                          CELESTE
           Big move. I'm proud of you.
                         
          Jesse looks confused and slightly hurt.
                         
                          JESSE
           Thanks?
                         
                          CELESTE
           Can I get up now?
                         
                          JESSE
           Huh? Yeah, sure.
                         
          Celeste gets up and is immediately fixated by his hair.
                         
           JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Yeah, Skillz kinda made me do it
           and from the get go, she was way
           into...what are you looking at?
                         
                          CELESTE
           No, nothing. Are you gonna wear
           your hair like that?
                         
                          JESSE
           What? Oh. I don't know, is it
           weird?
                         
                          CELESTE
           Not weird, just different from how
           it looks best.
                         
          She walks over and starts messing with his hair as he
          continues.
                         
                          JESSE
           Anyway, this is what we're doing
           right? We're getting divorced and
           we're friends and we're also dating
           people? That's what we're doing?
                         
          She is satisfied with her work. She steps back.
                         
                          CELESTE
           There. Better. You'll be great. You
           don't even need to be great. Just
           be you. Take her somewhere nice.
                         
                          JESSE
           Okay mom.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Call me after?
           25.
                         
                         
          16 INT. HATFIELD'S RESTAURANT-NIGHT 16
                         
           Jesse is on a date with Yogurt girl. It's clear he's hasn't
           been doing a lot of talking.
                         
                          YOGURT GIRL
           So I was in school but then I
           dropped out because I really wanted
           to work in fashion but it's really
           hard to find a paid internship? So
           I went back to school and now I
           work at Yoga Yurt part time but I'm
           really looking to make money doing
           something I love? But I'm sure the
           universe is looking out for me and
           when the time is right, the right
           thing will come along, you know?
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          17 INT. CELESTE'S BEDROOM- NIGHT 17
                         
           Celeste is in bed on the computer. She hears noise from the
           outside. She listens more intently and hears Jesse... and a
           woman, giggling and talking loudly. Then, the studio door
           shuts. Is Yogurt Girl sleeping over? He wouldn't do that.
           Would he?
                         
                         
          18 EXT. CELESTE'S GARDEN- NEXT MORNING 18
                         
           Again, with the morning symphony. Celeste drinks coffee, eats
           breakfast, surfs the internet and flips through magazines.
           This time, she's also listening to a song from Riley Banks'
           new album. It's exactly what she thought it would be.
           Overproduced, auto-tuned and meaningless. She nods her head,
           "yeah, I get it." She turns it off.
                         
           Celeste can't stop herself from constantly looking over at
           the studio to see if Yogurt Girl is still in there. Finally,
           a sleeping Jesse stirs for a minute and changes position. He
           is alone. Phew.
                         
                         
          19 INT. BORDER'S BOOKS-LATER THAT DAY 19
                         
           Celeste, Beth, Tucker and Jesse browse as a foursome for
           books.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Where is it? They told me it would
           be in new releases...
           26.
                         
                         
          Celeste searches frantically for her book. She peeks around a
          corner at a very obscured aisle with a sign reading "More New
          Releases." Three copies of her book, "Shitegeist" appear in
          the very bottom row, barely visible. She is disappointed.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           That's what I call placement.
                         
          She grabs a copy of her book and briskly walks back to the
          front of the store.
                         
                          BETH
           Well you probably shouldn't steal
           it. Even if it is yours.
                         
          Celeste marches to the Oprah's Book Club table and swiftly
          replaces the center display book with her own.
                         
                          CELESTE
           There.
                         
                          BETH
           But you don't have the "O" on your
           cover, you can't do that!
                         
                          CELESTE
           Yes I can.
                         
          Jesse and Tucker arrive and see the book.
                         
                          JESSE
           There you guys are...you're on
           Oprah's Book List?? That's so
           great!
                         
          Something catches Celeste's eye.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Some people are browsing my book.
           Guys, come with me to eavesdrop ...
                         
          Celeste, Tucker and Beth head off. Then:
                         
           GIRL (V.O.)
           Jesse?
                         
          Jesse turns to see VERONICA, 26, stunning and European.
                         
                          JESSE
           Veronica?
                         
                          VERONICA
           Yeah, hey. How are you?
           27.
                         
                         
                          JESSE
           Good, good. You look great.
                         
                          VERONICA
           Thanks, you too. How's your clothes
           pin collage going?
                         
                          JESSE
           Slowly, but it's going.
                         
                          VERONICA
           Well, don't give up. Your work is
           really unique. And beautiful. I
           hope that doesn't sound...
                         
                          JESSE
           No, that's means a lot, thank you.
                         
          They looks at each other for a beat.
                         
           JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           I had so much fun...that night. I'm
           so sorry I didn't call you. My life
           is just...
                         
                          VERONICA
           I had a lot of fun too.
                         
          There is silence, as Beth, Celeste and Tucker arrive and
          stare at her. Who is this creature??
                         
                          JESSE
           Oh sorry, Veronica, this is Beth
           and Tucker and Celeste.
                         
          Veronica notices Celeste's name on the book.
                         
                          VERONICA
           Oh, this is your book? I read an
           excerpt online, it's really
           compelling.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Wow, thank you. That is so nice.
                         
                          VERONICA
           Well, nice to see you.
                         
                          JESSE
           Oh you too. Take care.
                         
          She turns and leaves.
           28.
                         
                         
                          CELESTE
           What is that?
                         
                          JESSE
           That was uh...Veronica.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Story?
                         
                          JESSE
           No story. Just this girl I met a
           while ago.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Huh. She's pretty.
                         
           Celeste changes focus again and turns to a Border's employee
           to loudly and unconvincingly act out "Interested Reader" for
           other shoppers to hear.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           EXCUSE ME SIR? WHERE CAN I FIND
           MORE COPIES OF THIS BOOK
           "SHITEGEIST" FOR MY FRIENDS? I
           HEARD IT IS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!
                         
           He looks at her like she's crazy and keeps walking. And so do
           her friends.
                         
                         
          20 EXT. TROUBADOR THEATER-NIGHT 20
                         
           Jesse and Skillz are exiting a Bizmarkie concert, surrounded
           by older hip-hop fans and young hipsters who weren't alive
           when the Biz dropped his first album. They are trashed.
                         
                          SKILLZ
           Oh baby youuuuuuuu, you got what I
           neeeeeed...
                         
                          JESSE
           And you say he's just a friend, and
           you say he's just a friend....
                         
                          JESSE SKILLZ
           Oh baby youuuuu.... Oh baby youuuuu....
                         
           Jesse's iPhone rings. A very flirty picture of Celeste comes
           up.
                         
                          SKILLZ
           No, no, no. Ignore for sure.
           29.
                         
                         
                          JESSE
           Uh, I just need to...(picks up)
           Hey.
                         
                          SKILLZ
           (whispering) Nooooo!
                         
                          JESSE
           (talking to Celeste) Uh huh. Okay.
           Okay. No, I'm not busy. (hangs up)
           Uh, I'm gonna go home.
                         
                          SKILLS
           Come on, after the show it's the

                          JESSE
           There's an Ikea dresser that she
           needs me to "build."
                         
           Skillz takes this in. He is impressed.
                         
                          SKILLZ
           Huh. Really, cowboy? Are you
           guys...
                         
                          JESSE
           I told you pal, I know what I'm
           know I'm doing. She just needed
           time.
                         
                         
                         
          21 INT. CELESTE'S HOUSE-NIGHT 21
                         
           Celeste is in a corner with a glass of wine and a HUGE bag of
           nuts and bolts. She had a fight with a dresser and the
           dresser won. Jesse uses his key and enters.
                         
                          CELESTE
           I'm in here! Fuck Sweden!
                         
                          JESSE
           Oh baby youuuuu....
                         
                          CELESTE
           It was definitely easier to build
           the Brooklyn Bridge, I think.
                         
                          JESSE
           Well, how hard can it be? It's a
           dresser, right?

          22 INT. CELESTE'S HOUSE- 30 MINUTES LATER 22
                         
           Jesse is drunker than before and sitting where Celeste was
           earlier. Crying, frustrated. He's covered in sawdust and nuts
           and bolts.
                         
                          JESSE
           Fuck me!!! Do you think they
           intentionally pick a random piece
           of furniture to make totally
           unbuildable, just to fuck with
           you??!
                         
                          CELESTE
           Thank you!

           We see Jesse and Celeste admire their "dresser" as they drink
           wine.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Perfect.
                         
                          JESSE
           Fucking lay-up.
                         
           We reveal that they are looking at a small, mangled, Swedish
           robot constructed from the nuts and bolts and wood panelling
           that should have been the dresser. They both slide to the
           floor in satisfaction. They look at their "artwork." They
           laugh; they are pretty drunk.

           Yeah. He's a vegan, you know.
                         
                          JESSE
           Cherish. That is so cute.
                         
           They share a laugh.

           You're cute.
                         
           Celeste looks at him. She kisses him. He kisses back. It gets
           hotter. They fall back.

          24 INT. CELESTE'S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING 24
                         
           Celeste and Jesse are in bed. Celeste is asleep. Jesse wakes
           up and gently kisses Celeste all over her face. This wakes
           her up. She is hungover and confused.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Hey. What are you doing?
                         
                          JESSE
           I love you.
                         
           Celeste does not respond. She pops up out of bed.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Okay...
                         
                          JESSE
           We should talk about this.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Yeah. Whoa, we were drunk. What a
           bad idea. I'm sorry.
                         
                          JESSE
           Don't be sorry. It was nice. And I
           love you.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Oh Jess, I don't...come on, we were
           drunk, and the dresser and I
           thought...you're dating other
           people!
                         
                          JESSE
           Only to...god, I'm so stupid.
                         
           He realizes how pathetic it sounds.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Oh no, I thought...
                         
                          JESSE
           You thought what?
           32.
                         
                         
                          CELESTE
           Well, clearly I wasn't thinking. Or
           I wouldn't have let it happen. Come
           on Jess, we're not getting back
           together, you didn't think...
                         
           Celeste realizes he did think...Jesse is crushed. He gets up
           and leaves. He turns.
                         
                          JESSE
           You know, there's a guy that you
           can call, from Ikea, that will
           build you're dresser. You should
           call him. Hell, he'll probably fuck
           you too. I'm a fucking idiot.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Jess! No, I didn't..Jess!
                         
           Celeste collapses back in the bed.
                         
                         
          25 INT. EQUINOX GYM-MORNING 25
                         
           A bunch of Los Angeles hipsters file out of a yoga class.
           Everyone is sweaty and a little out of it. Celeste heads out
           as she towels off. She heads towards the shoe cubby holes.
                         
                          PAUL
           Hello.
                         
                          CELESTE
           What?
                         
                          PAUL
           I said hello.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Oh. Hi.
                         
           Celeste keeps walking briskly. PAUL, 35, short but handsome,
           tries to keep up with her.
                         
                          PAUL
           (a little too loud) How was your
           practice?
                         
                          CELESTE
           My practice?? It was...wait,
           what?...it was fine. (who is this
           guy?)
           33.
                         
                         
                          PAUL
           I see you in class a lot. You have
           a great warrior two. Are you
           single?
                         
          Celeste puts on her shoes.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Are you really doing this right
           now? You're really doing this right
           now.
                         
          Paul realizes that his game is wack. Oh well.
                         
                          PAUL
           Yeah, I can't believe it either. I
           don't do this, it's just happening,
           I can't stop...it...what do you do?
                         
                          CELESTE
           Just gonna jump right in there.
           Wow, Captain Conversation.
                         
                          PAUL
           Paul. Here's my card.
                         
                          CELESTE
           You bring cards to yoga??
                         
                          PAUL
           Look, you're really pretty. I'm not
           good at this. Help.
                         
          He smiles nervously.
                         
                          CELESTE
           (she looks at the card.) A
           financial analyst. Cool.
                         
                          PAUL
           Not really. It's not cool. Did
           you ever tell me what you did for a
           living?
                         
                          CELESTE
           No, no I didn't.
                         
          There is a pause in conversation. Celeste continues to put
          her shoes on.
                         
                          PAUL
           Well, will you? I'd love to know.

                          CELESTE
           I'm a trend forecaster. I forecast
           trends.
                         
           Paul scoffs at the notion that this is a real career.
                         
                          PAUL
           Trend forecaster. Really? Huh.
                         
           They have reached the parking lot. Celeste turns to him with
           purpose.
                         
                          CELESTE
           You traded in your Porsche for an
           Audi because the economy is tanking
           and you're afraid you'll lose your
           job soon. You bought a Samsung cell
           phone because you think it makes
           you seem more "business-oriented,"
           unlike the iPhone which is for
           teenage girls. You go to yoga
           because you went to a sub Ivy
           League college, spent the last ten
           years working long weeks and
           drinking all weekend and you feel
           like it's time to do something
           "spiritual." Nice to meet you,
           (looks at the card) Paul.
                         
           Celeste walks away. Paul remains where he is, flummoxed.

           Celeste enters through her side gate. She has some Chinese
           takeout in her hand. She heads for the studio. She sees that
           Jesse is not there. Neither is any of his shit. It's
           completely empty and sterile now. He's gone.

                          CELESTE
           No, just make sure the San Fran
           focus group has a little more
           diversity than last time. It was
           like a rave. Without drugs. Okay.
                         
           She hangs up and pauses. Then dials again.
           35.

           We see Celeste having lunch with a group of eight teenagers.
           She asks questions, they share laughs, she engages with them.
           She is good at this. She excuses herself to make a phone
           call.

           Jesse is mid-laugh and looks at his phone to see Celeste is
           calling. He presses "Ignore." We see that he is sitting with
           a women. We reveal that it is: Veronica.

           She hangs up, takes a breath and then, to herself:
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           I love you. I'm so sorry. I've

           Yeah, I want to talk to you too.
           Where have you been?? It's been

           Well, the truth is, I slept with
           Veronica three months ago. It was
           just a one night thing. But she's
           pregnant.

           right now. This is not good.
           Alright. Okay. You and I are gonna
           deal with this. We will, we'll just
           have to. What do you need me to do?
                         
                          JESSE
           No, you don't have to do anything.
                         
                          CELESTE
           But you don't even know this
           person, right?
                         
                          JESSE
           Yeah I know her. I mean, I'm
           getting to know her. And I really
           want to make it work with her.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Make it work?? You slept with her
           once! What are you talking about?
                         
                          JESSE
           I've actually been seeing her,
           well, a lot, recently. And I think
           I really like her.
                         
                          CELESTE
           So what you're saying is you got a
           girl pregnant and now you think you
           like her because she's pregnant?
           Or...I'm really confused.
                         
                          JESSE
           The universe is fucking weird,
           Celeste. I slept with her months
           ago and never called her after.

                          JESSE (CONTD)
           But we started hanging recently and
           she told me she was pregnant with
           my child. I know it's crazy, but
           it just feels...right. It was like
           this really weird retroactive gift.
           I don't know...
                         
                          CELESTE
           Can you excuse me for a second?
                         
           Celeste gets up and walks slowly to the bathroom. She gently
           shuts the door. She looks around, not knowing what to do with
           herself. She focuses on a crack in the wall, she looks closer
           and then grabs the wall, thinking she might faint. She
           silently begins to sob, mouth open, eyes shut tight. She
           collapses on the wall. She is in silent turmoil. Is this
           really happening?

           Jesse is sitting, waiting. He checks his cell phone. He hears
           the toilet flush. A moment goes by. Celeste re-enters,
           having pulled it together. But her face is still wet with
           tears.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Sorry about that. I had something
           in my eye.
                         
                          JESSE
           Right. Look, I know this is so
           sudden. And so weird. I've been
           holding on to us, this idea of us,
           for so long. And I know you've
           wanted me to let go. So I'm sorry.
           You were right, we're friends. We
           will always be friends. And I need
           that now.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Of course.
                         
                          JESSE
           Thank you. Love you.
                         
           Jesse gives Celeste a big, long hug.
                         
           JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Wait, you had something to tell me
           too. Sorry...

           Celeste takes a beat.

           It was nothing.
                         
           She forces a smile.

           in.

           It's Sean Comb's Twitter page.
           There's also a singing competition
           on television. It's called American

           Well, just part of our job,
           so...ready for breaking news? Jesse
           is having a baby with some girl.
           Crazy.
                         
                          SCOTT

                          SCOTT
           I don't know what to say. I am so
           sorry, Celeste.

           No need, Scott, I'm totally fine.

                          SCOTT
           Well, it's great that you're so
           resolved about this but it's also
           okay for you to have feelings. It's
           very sudden.
                         
          Celeste pauses to consider this.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Right. Well, let me see...mmmm,
           nope, I'm fine. I promise. Not in
           love with him anymore. It kind of
           makes it easier.
                         
          Scott is not convinced. Celeste is still distracted by the
          computer.

           Celeste, in workout clothes, is cleaning up her house
           maniacally. She is walking past her office. The Ikea robot
           she built with Jesse catches her attention for a moment. She
           keeps walking.

           Celeste and MAX, 38, handsome and clean cut, are sitting at
           dinner. They have just ordered.

           My foot actually pronates. And my
           I.T. band is strained when I run,
           which really hurts. So Dr. Ozar
           recommended a foot specialist who
           made these customized orthotics for
           me and it's amazing how much better
           I feel.

           Suddenly, Celeste catches a glimpse of Jesse, sitting at the
           bar, by himself, watching tv. She is not prepared for this.
                         
                          CELESTE
           OH MY GOD. My ex is here. Oh god,
           oh no, we just made eye contact.
           Maybe he didn't see me. Wait, he
           did. He's coming over. Oh god,
           this is so awkward.(to Max) You
           should probably leave.

           Celeste pants like she's about to collapse. She doubles over

           nice.
                         
           Celeste flops on the couch full prostrate. A saleswoman
           approaches.
                         
                          SALESWOMAN

           could maybe just sit over there?
                         
           The saleswoman points to a metal industrial, uncomfortable

           Celeste gets up and there is an outline of Celeste's entire

           Rupert finishes the song, closes his eyes and hangs his head.
           A beat of silence. Celeste musters up a short and slow round
           of applause.

           the hall quickly to the bathroom.
                         
                         
          46 INT. POP FORM BATHROOM 46
                         
           Celeste enters a stall. Then, she hears two girls enter the
           bathroom. RILEY, 19 and SAVANNAH, 22, are chatting and
           primping. Celeste goes quiet and listens.
                         
                          RILEY
           Ugh. My hair is so dry. It looks
           like straw.
                         
           Savannah quickly pops a pill. Then offers one to Riley.
                         
                          SAVANNAH
           Here. Do you want an Adderall?
           51.
                         
                         
                          RILEY
           No, that shit makes me feel like a
           robot. Speaking of robot, who the
           hell designed this place? It's
           like Spock and his eyebrows are
           about to walk around the corner.
                         
          Celeste takes this opportunity to flush and come out of the
          stall.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Hi Riley, I'm Celeste, I'm a
           partner at Pop Form.
                         
                          RILEY
           Hey. Wow, you're pretty.
                         
          Riley looks closer at her skin and picks at it.
                         
           RILEY (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Why am I breaking out?
                         
                          SAVANNAH
           Too much sugar? Coffee? Alcohol?
                         
                          RILEY
           Ugh, maybe it's my skin regime.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Um...it's actually regimen?
                         
                          RILEY
           Sorry?
                         
                          CELESTE
           Regime is a system of government.
           It's a "skin regimen."
                         
          Riley and Savannah glare at Celeste.
                         
                          RILEY
           Thanks, Scrabble. Nice to meet you.
                         
          They leave.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Charming.

           The Riley Banks branding strategy meeting is under way.
           Slides are being shown, Scott is giving a presentation on
           design ideas. Celeste is distracted and on her Blackberry.
           We see an INSERT of Celeste's Blackberry on Dictionary.com,
           looking up "regime: a mode or system of rule or government."
                         
                          SCOTT
           Celeste has some ideas for the logo
           which are looking really great.
                         
           He looks to Celeste who is not paying attention. She is busy
           learning that she was right and Riley was wrong. Celeste
           looks up and shoots a patronizing smile at Riley. Riley
           catches her and looks away uncomfortably.
                         
           SCOTT (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Celeste? Do you wanna...
                         
                          CELESTE
           Right. Yes. Sorry. So we are going
           for an industrial feel with the
           artwork...

                          SCOTT
           Hello, Special One.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Uh, you got my IM.
                         
                          SCOTT
           Sounds so awful.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Where are the guys who don't wear
           makeup for a living? And maybe a
           little intellect? A little
           intellect wouldn't hurt anybody.
                         
           Scott has an idea.
                         
                          SCOTT
           Wait, wait. You've never met Nick,
           right? Nick Moran?

           Yeah, we went to school together.
           This could be perfect.
                         
                          CELESTE

           musical) I'm uncomfortable with
           daaaaaating. I don't like any of
           iiiiiit.

           Celeste sits on the balcony with Nick Moran. He has Indy
           rocker hair and a Los Feliz beard. He's hip and smart in an
           effortless way. Celeste is feeling him. They drink wine and
           laugh.
                         
                          CELESTE
           So you pissed in your pants?
                         
                          NICK
           I waited seven hours. Three of them
           soaking in my own pee. But I
           finally got the shot of
           Ahmadinejad.
                         
           He hands her a photograph.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Wow. That is incredible. I think
           he's smiling, maybe.
                         
                          NICK
           He is. I think the piss stain
           running down my jeans made him
           laugh.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Well, the world will think you're

           (looking at his watch) Oh my god,
           we missed our reservation. It was
           at 8:30. Should I call down and see
           if they can still take us?

           Nick and Celeste are kissing. It's passionate but tender.
           They stop and their foreheads rest against each other's and
           they take a deep breath. They speak in hushed tones.
                         
                          CELESTE
           That was really, really nice.
                         
                          NICK
           Um, yeah. So, what are you doing
           for the rest of your life?
                         
                          CELESTE
           Making out with you.
                         
           They start to kiss again.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           I don't remember it ever feeling
           like this.
                         
           They continue to kiss. Celeste notices that she and the couch
           are vibrating. She looks down. Oh no. Nick is masturbating.
           Can he really be masturbating?

           Don't do that..It was going so
           well.
                         
                          NICK
           Shhhhh.
                         
           Celeste pulls away slowly, shaking her head, "no." Nick keeps
           going. Eyes closed.
                         
           NICK (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Watch me. I'm almost there.
                         
           Celeste cannot believe what she is watching.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Almost where?? No!
                         
           Celeste quickly grabs her stuff and gets the hell out of

           Ah, ah, ahhhhhhhhh!
                         
           Nick recovers from his climax and looks around to realize
           she's gone.

           Celeste runs really hard, listening to her Sunny Levine's
           "Glass Jaw" on her iPhone. She stops suddenly. She sees
           Jesse's number, she hits "Ignore." She starts running again
           with purpose.

           Celeste enters and sees Jesse sitting at a table in a small,
           folksy restaurant. Celeste is on the phone. She waves at
           Jesse and gestures "one second."
                         
                          CELESTE
           No, I don't want to do a video
           chat. Yeah. Just tell her she needs
           to get to L.A. tomorrow. Okay. (she
           hangs up, now on the Blackberry)
           Sorry, one second, I just have to
           send this e-mail.
                         
           Jesse sits there and wait for several seconds for her to
           finish her e-mail.

           because...apparently there's some
           kind of hold up on your side with

           Well, Jesse, I've been busy with
           work. Because some people work for

           What makes you think you are even
           suitable to be a dad?? You don't
           even know how to read the electric
           bill. How are you going to support
           yourself? Have you even thought
           this through?
                         
                          JESSE
           I guess I'll have to figure it out.
           Veronica is really supportive of my
           work.
                         
                          CELESTE

           supportive, I don't know what is.

           Robot catches her eye. She stops and enters the office.

           She kicks it. That hurt. She violently, with all her might,
           rips its head off. That felt good. She picks it up and starts
           to thrash the robot torso all over the room as, slowly,
           pieces of wood flail in every direction. She's angry and out
           of control. She stops to catch her breath and sees what she
           has just done. She falls to the ground in tears.

           (Playful) Sorry about that day at

           My husband of six years wants a
           divorce so he can marry the woman
           who's carrying his child. That's
           the deal with you and me.

           Listen, Yoga, I don't WANT to be
           right, I AM right. People will let
           you down. I've accepted that fact,
           but unfortunately, most of the
           time, knowing that does keep you
           from being happy. But at least
           it's real.

           Celeste is going through papers on her desk. She's cleaning
           house. She sees the envelope from the divorce lawyer. She
           quickly tosses it aside. Then she comes across one of Jesse's
           old notebooks. She flips through it. She reads a couple of
           sweet passages about her, it makes her smile. She grabs the
           phone.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Hey, it's Celeste. You know, I
           still have a bunch of your stuff in
           the office. You should probably
           grab it at some point. Okay.
                         
           She hangs up. She makes a decision. She grabs a box and
           starts throwing everything and anything in it that belongs to
           Jesse.

           Celeste carries a box of Jesse's stuff to his front door.
           She doesn't knock. She leaves the box by the door. But she
           decides to keep the one journal with the sweet passages for
           herself; she deserves it and he'll never know. She starts to
           walk away when she notices, it's trash day.

           Three trash cans-green, brown, and blue-are lined up in the
           driveway. A huge box is protruding from the blue can.
           Celeste considers. So much to be learned from the trash. She
           slowly walks over. She peeks in at the box; it has a big
           picture of a fancy stroller on the side of it. Crushing.

           extravagant purchase for a
           freelance writer and his "elegant"
           Belgian bride.
                         
          All of a sudden, her diamond bracelet slips off her wrist and
          plunks to the bottom.

           Shit. Shit shit shit.
                         
          She drops Jesse's journal to the concrete and crawls into the
          trash can, still reaching for the bottom, not quite getting
          there. The trash can falls over with her in it. Just then,
          Jesse's car pulls up and headlights shine on Celeste half-way
          in the trash can. She fumbles and then:
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Ow!!! Shit!
                         
          A piece of glass from the can has sliced her face. She
          immediately wiggles out of the trash can, stands it back up
          again. She looks for a place to run. It's too late. She picks
          up the journal and hides behind the trash cans but Jesse and
          Veronica have been watching her whole opera from the car.
          Jesse approaches a crouching Celeste.

          Celeste stands up slowly as if nothing is wrong. She is also
          holding Jesse's journal close to her chest.

           Celeste and Beth eat lunch in the zen garden outside the Pop
           Form building. Celeste is picking at the end of her sandwich,
           recounting the waking nightmare of last night. The cut on her
           face is neatly bandaged.
                         
                          BETH
           You told her you liked her sweater?
           What are you, twelve?
                         
                          CELESTE
           It was a disaster. But you should
           have seen the sweater. So great.
           Beth, am I losing my mind?
                         
                          BETH
           Maybe. No. Please no more trash-

           Celeste is lying in a quiet, dark room in thai fisherman
           pants and a large t-shirt. She takes a deep breath.
                         
                          CELESTE
           So where do you live?
                         
           We reveal that she is lying next to Paul, they are both about
           to get thai massages.
                         
                          PAUL

           You are gonna love this place.
           You've never felt so relaxed in
           your life.
                         
           Cherry and Lucky enter, the masseuses. They all exchange
           quiet hellos and head nods. Cherry and Lucky get to work.
           Lucky takes Celeste's leg and pushes it all the way over her
           head, not the most comfortable position.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Ahhhhh.(responding to the stretch)
           Wow, this is a unique place to take
           a date.
                         
                          PAUL
           Yeah, I take all my dates here.
                         
                          CELESTE

           You are. They all are.
                         
           Celeste giggles. Paul takes a deep exhale as Cherry rams her
           elbow into his shoulderblade.

                          CELESTE
           Not...that well. I've been on a
           real winning streak, so I thought
           I'd call you.
                         
                          PAUL
           You know what? I'm happy you did.
                         
           At that moment, CRACK! Lucky has Celeste in a bear hug and it
           looks like she may have broken her back.
                         
                          CELESTE
           AHHHH! I don't know what your
           definition of relaxing is but...

           looks like she's in pain.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Why would you take me to a place
           where Asian people beat you up?
           That was absolute torture.
                         
                          PAUL
           But how do you feel?
                         
           Celeste takes a beat to see how she feels.
                         
                          CELESTE
           I feel great, actually.
                         
                          PAUL
           So shut up then.
                         
                          CELESTE

                          PAUL
           Don't try to control me. You need
           to let go. In yoga, we call it
           vairyaga.
                         
           He strikes a reverse triangle yoga pose in the parking lot.

           Celeste and Paul walk down stairs into an incredibly cool-
           looking speak easy. Teddy Pendegrass' "Love TKO" is playing
           and people are dancing, actually dancing. No one is there to
           be seen, there is no pretention.
                         
                          CELESTE
           This place is...really cool.

           I'll get us beers.
                         
           Celeste takes in the atmosphere for a moment. She is happy to
           be out. She takes her hair down, puts her hands through it,
           trying to look a little better.
                         
           PAUL (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Hey!
                         
           Paul is on the dance floor, with two beers. Celeste meets
           him, takes her beer, and downs a third of it. Celeste looks
           up and Paul has started to dance. He looks at Celeste with
           jocular seduction. He's actually not a bad dancer. Maybe he's
           good? Okay, no, he's great. Paul pulls Celeste in and they
           dance together. She's sort of embarrassed but she's having
           fun. Paul pulls away in a little spin and goes into a James
           Brown splits move.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Ohh!!
                         
           Celeste is into it now. She dances around him, other people
           watch them. Paul pulls Celeste in close. Celeste kisses Paul
           quickly, to his surprise.
                         
                          PAUL
           What was that for?

           She does now. She loves it.
                         
          Jesse takes this in. Tucker changes the subject.
                         
                          TUCKER
           How's Veronica? She's so sweet.
                         
                          JESSE
           Yeah, less sweet pregnant but it's
           probably just hormones.
                         
                          TUCKER

                          JESSE
           Yeah, I really like her. She seems
           great. For someone that I don't
           really know that's having my baby.

           there's a video. It's of Jesse and Veronica. Jesse presents
           Veronica with a cake, she laughs and blows out the candles.
           They kiss. Crushing. Confusing. Her doorbell rings.

           The door opens to reveal Skillz. He holds up a bag of weed.
                         
                         
                          SKILLZ
           Step out of the shadows and into
           the light. Are you crying?
                         
                          CELESTE
           I don't know what I'm doing. Dating
           is stupid and all of a sudden, my
           ex-husband bakes cakes? It's
           probably fucking gluten-free.
                         
                          SKILLZ
           What?
                         
                          CELESTE
           Nothing. Can you just roll a joint
           please?
                         
           Skillz rolls a tight joint.

           Day by day, C. You need not trip.
                         
           Celeste takes a drag.
                         
                          CELESTE
           What are they like together?

           Yeah.
                         
                          SKILLZ
           You know, they're oh-kay. Jesse is
           trying. It's not all rainbows and
           unicorns but...
                         
                          CELESTE
           So he's not happy.

           I didn't say that.

           Pop Form employees file out of a Riley Banks meeting. Riley
           approaches Celeste.
                         
                          RILEY
           I really like the logo.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Oh, thank you. Yeah, I think it's
           perfect.
                         
                          RILEY
           The I.M. Pei influence is pretty
           cool.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Wow, yeah, there is a little of
           that happening. I.M. Pei. Huh.
                         
                          RILEY
           Are you mocking me?
                         
                          CELESTE
           No, I'm just impressed that you
           know anything about architecture.
                         
                          RILEY
           Why, because I'm a pop star? You
           know what your thing is? Contempt
           prior to investigation.
                         
                          CELESTE
           I'm sorry?
                         
                          RILEY
           You're convinced you're smarter
           than everyone and THAT is your
           dark little prison.
           77.
                         
                         
                          CELESTE
           Are you...?? How dare you...
                         
           Riley smiles at Celeste, turns and leaves.

           Celeste is still reeling from Riley's verbal undressing.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Dark little prison?? Bitch, what
           does she know. You know what's a
           dark little prison?? Having to wear
           midriffs for a living. What does
           she...
                         
           Celeste is pulling into her driveway and notices...Jesse,
           sitting on her porch, smoking a cigarette.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           What the fuck.

           Celeste cautiously walks up to her front door. Before she can
           speak, Jesse does.
                         
                          JESSE
           I started smoking again.
                         
                          CELESTE
           I can see that. That must go well
           with your pilates.
                         
           Jesse looks sad and confused.
                         
                          JESSE
           I don't know what the rules are and
           I'm sure I'm breaking them
           but...god, I really miss you.
                         
           Celeste tries to digest this.
                         
                          CELESTE
           You want to come in?

           They are in her living room on the couch, have a drink.

           Veronica is friends with the
           assistant gallerist there and he
           just really loved my stuff. I
           don't know, we'll see...
                         
                          CELESTE
           Jesse, that's great. I'm so happy
           for you.
                         
                          JESSE
           Yeah, yeah. It's great.
                         
           Why doesn't he seem happier? He knocks back the rest of the
           drink.
                         
           JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           I should probably get home.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Yeah. It's really nice to see you.
                         
           He hugs her. Tight. They breathe together. They hug
           tighter. He pulls away, looks at her and kisses her for one
           second, very tenderly. She pulls away.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           You should go.
                         
                          JESSE
           Can we just...lay here for a bit?
                         
           Celeste lays down and Jesse spoons behind her on the couch.
           They hold each other. There's a long drag of silence.
                         
           JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           I can't believe I'm having a
           baby...and it's not with you.
                         
           We see Celeste's face but Jesse doesn't. She's crying.

           from the night before, wakes up. Jesse is gone. She fumbles
           for the phone.

           INSERT of a large, magnified version of Riley's "RB" logo. It
           is pretty clear what the image looks like. Scott stares at

           (referring to the logo) It's a

           You can't be serious. (points to
           the logo) There's the penis. And
           there's the penis going into the
           butt.
                         
                          CELESTE

           It is intercut with a montage of Super 8 footage of Celeste
           and Jesse in the past: At a seaside house, Jesse is
           reluctantly cutting a head off a fish to cook it, Celeste is
           repulsed but laughing. Celeste and Jesse cuddle in a sleeping
           bag, fighting off the cold. Celeste and Jesse take cover in a
           torrential New York City rain. They stand under an awning and
           she smiles as she runs her hand through his wet hair. Celeste
           is abruptly shaken out of her memories by a giant Chewbacca
           hugging her before she has a chance to stop him.

           Celeste...
                         
                          CELESTE
           Wait, let me say something. I
           don't know what happened last
           night. I don't know what's
           happening with your other
           situation. But I need to say this.
           For the record, I fucked up. I was
           cavalier about you. I took us for
           granted. And I know this may sound
           crazy but I'd be remiss if I
           didn't...if you were open to it...I
           think that I could do better. With
           you. With us. If there's a chance
           still...I'd like to know.
                         
           Jesse can't even look at her.

           Jesse?
           82.
                         
                         
                          JESSE
           I'm sorry. I can't.
                         
           Jesse gets up and leaves.

           Jesse walks out of the bar. He takes a deep breath and starts
           walking. A beat later, Celeste tears out of the bar, walking
           quickly after Jesse.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Hey!
                         
           Jesse pauses for a moment. He turns.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Why did you come to my house last
           night?
                         
                          JESSE
           I don't know.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Oh no, I think you do.
                         
                          JESSE
           I made a mistake.
                         
                          CELESTE
           And?
                         
                          JESSE
           I shouldn't have come.
                         
                          CELESTE
           You're a fucking coward.
                         
                          JESSE
           I'm just trying to do the right
           thing with Veronica. I'm trying to
           change.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Well, you never changed for me.
                         
           Jesse pauses.
                         
                          JESSE
           To be honest, you didn't really let
           me.
           83.

           Wow. All I did was wait for you to
           grow up! I rooted for you, I
           fucking paid for everything, I did
           everything for you!
                         
                          JESSE
           Yeah, and I was never your equal.
           And you know what? I think you
           preferred it that way.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Right. Well, I know my success was
           never easy for you.
                         
                          JESSE
           And how do you define success,
           Celeste? Because you don't look
           very successful right now.
                         
                          CELESTE
           And you are? Pretending to be a
           father? Pretending to be an adult?
                         
                          JESSE
           What do you want?
                         
                          CELESTE
           I just want you to admit that
           you're wrong!
                         
                          JESSE
           Wrong? Wrong about what? What did
           you want me to do? Wait for you to
           meet someone first? Is that how you
           saw it happening?
                         
          Celeste doesn't respond.
                         
           JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           I didn't expect to meet someone so
           fast, but I did. And I think we
           have a chance to be happy together.
           I don't want to blow that.
                         
                          CELESTE
           You know what, Jesse? You
           definitely will blow it.
                         
          Jesse takes a beat. It stings.
                         
                          JESSE
           I feel really sorry for you. You
           might be alone forever.

           He starts to walk away. Celeste call after him.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Don't ever call me.
                         
                          JESSE
           Don't worry about it.
                         
           Jesse walks away.

           Skillz and Celeste sit in her backyard and watch the last
           scene from "Dirty Dancing." The image is being projected onto
           her garden wall. There is no sound. Instead, Bob Marley's
           "Kaya" plays over the speakers. Celeste is ripping an
           enormous bowl from a four-foot bong. Skillz is on his knees,
           bracing the bong, looking at Celeste with admiration. Celeste
           watches the movie.
                         
                          CELESTE
           She's so sad.
                         
                          SKILLZ
           Is she? I don't think so.
                         
                          CELESTE
           No, she's sad. I can tell. I went
           to dance camp.
                         
           We see Jennifer Grey elevated above Patrick Swayze, looking
           elated. Celeste exhales a huge billow of smoke.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           That's the first good thing that's

           Celeste is sitting alone, wearing sunglasses, and
           uncharacteristically colorful clothes that don't match. Like
           a crazy lady jumpsuit. She is going to town on a HUGE plate
           of food: chicken wings, fries, burger, hot dog, coleslaw, egg
           salad and a beer. She attacks it like it's her last meal
           ever. She's also trashed. Celeste gets up and heads towards a
           group of people talking including, Beth's mom, Beth and a
           couple of her girlfriends.

           Beth is embarrassed. Celeste gives Beth's mom, CAROL, 60,
           very large, a big sloppy hug.

           Beth has tons of Barneys New York bags and is trying on
           clothes for her rehearsal dinner. Celeste is in the fetal

           (on the phone) Hey Riley, it's
           Celeste. I just want to talk to
           you about this "error" in your
           logo. I'm so, so sorry, I will fix
           this...call me.
                         
                          BETH
           I just think it's corny to wear
           white two nights in a row. I want
           to rock a pattern, or maybe
           something in pastel...
                         
          She turns to Celeste in a dress.

           make a decision now. You owe me.
           You humped my grandmother
           yesterday.

           Yeah dude! She's fucking moderately
           talented, blessed with a good face
           and has maybe 5 more years left of
           stardom. Who is she to tell ME
           what...
                         
          Celeste looks at her blackberry and realizes she never hung
          up on Riley. Oh shit. She hangs up quick and throws the
          blackberry across the bed.

           The thing is, I have been having a
           really hard time in my life,
           everything is sort of falling apart

           contempt and investigation, it just
           sort of hit a nerve and...

                          RILEY
           Nobody knew. He didn't want anybody
           to know. Fucking ass hole. And
           now, my career might be over
           because you put a penis in my logo.
           Thank you for that.
                         
           Riley is clearly destroyed.

           Riley is asleep on the couch with a blanket over her.
           Celeste is up, watching "Great Sports Moments of 2008" on
           ESPN Classic.
                         
           It is a recap of Matthias Steiner's Olympic weight lifting
           triumph after his wife died. Jesse's favorite. Celeste is
           crying. This wakes Riley up.
                         
                          RILEY

           Celeste is runs into a dry cleaners. She is out of breathe.
           The long line of impatient people to see this dragon breather
           who has broke the silence. She looks at her watch. She
           stands diligently in line.
                         
           Celeste's phone rings loudly. She picks it up.

           too.
                         
           She hangs up and was clearly lying. She must do something.
           Something she does not want to do. She looks at the stoic
           woman in front of her.

           The camera pulls out. A wide shot of Celeste, imprisoned by
           her own rules, asking every person to cut. It looks tedious
           and ridiculous.

           street in the center of town. She unwraps her sandwich from
           noisy, wax paper. It's really quiet in the deli. She sees a
           group of wedding guests outside. They wave. She waves back.

                          GIRL #1
           She pursued her love of Spanish
           men, but missed her Tucker, more
           than just as a friend.

          was supposed to speak. Oh no. She gets up slowly and grabs
          the mike.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Thank you. Thanks a lot, girls,
           that was so...wow. There are no
           words. Well, this is gonna sound
           bad but I actually forgot that I
           was speaking tonight.

           her?

          laughing.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Thanks, Tom. Man, it was much
           longer than I thought to get to Big
           Sur from Los Angeles on a Friday
           afternoon. Stellar call on having a
           destination wedding the weekend
           before 4th of July. Busiest travel
           day of the year. So thanks for
           that, Mrs. Weinberg.

           But the truth is, I would go
           anywhere for Beth. She's my best
           friend. And I'm so happy for her.
           Senior year of college, we had a
           tradition. Every Sunday, come rain
           or shine, Beth and Tucker would
           meet me and Jesse at the Bishop
           with a 12-pack of Miller High Life,
           the champagne of beers, and we
           would meet to talk about what was
           important in the world, you know,
           Heidegger's influence on hip-hop.
           Or the feminist duality on "Melrose
           Place." Life's big questions. Beth
           and Tucker were just friends then
           but there was always something
           there. Just an ease they had with
           each other. Jesse and I spent years
           trying to get them together,
           unsuccessfully.

           watched as Tucker dated the most

           Finally, he removed his head from
           his ass, and saw what was in front
           of him. And that was beautiful
           Beth. And none of us could be
           happier about it; they were
           perfect. At last. Love wins.
                         
           Wedding guests clap. They think it's over. It's not.
           Celeste looks at Jesse in the crowd. Veronica is next to
           him.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Um...Jesse and I are getting a
           divorce. So that's...yeah, our
           timing was not as good, I guess.
           Beth and Tucker, you are lucky to
           be best friends. Work hard and
           respect that. It doesn't come
           easily. Be patient, don't always
           think you're right. And if you are,
           it doesn't fucking matter anyway.
           Fight for it, everyday, I wish I
           had.
                         
                         
          93 EXT. RECEPTION TENT-AN HOUR LATER 93
                         
           Celeste is holding a small plate of food. Jesse sidles up to
           her.
                         
                          JESSE
           I know this may not the best time
           to talk about this...but...at some
           point, we will have to talk about
           Tucker's dance moves.
                         
           INSERT of Tucker dancing on the dance floor. It's
           unexplainable. It's shocking how terrible it is.
                         
                          CELESTE
           He is so special. Not as special as
           that poem. That those girls did?
                         
                          JESSE CELESTE
           Wow. Wow.
           95.
                         
                         
          He takes a beat.
                         
                          JESSE
           Your speech was really...beautiful.
           Thank you.
                         
                          CELESTE
           I meant it.
                         
                          JESSE
           I know.
                         
                          CELESTE
           You know what else is beautiful?
                         
                         
          Celeste picks up a baby gerkin from her plate and starts to
          jerk it off, as she and Jesse did earlier and as they have
          done many times.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Oh god, tug it.
                         
          Jesse starts to participate. He dips his finger in the creme
          fraiche and puts it on the top of the gerkin.
                         
                          JESSE
           Aw yeah! Fuck!
                         
          Jesse and Celeste are in hysterics. Just then, Veronica
          arrives.
                         
                          VERONICA
           Jesse?
                         
                          JESSE
           Hey.
                         
          Celeste and Jesse stop like two children who just got caught.
                         
                          VERONICA
           What are you doing?
                         
                          JESSE
           What? Nothing. We're just...
                         
          He looks at Celeste for cover. She is giddy, wasted and happy
          to explain.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Oh, Jesse and I do this thing where
           we find the littlest thing that
           resembles a penis and we just, you
           know...
           96.
                         
                         
           Celeste and Jesse demonstrate for Veronica. Celeste looks up
           and realizes how dumb this must seem.
                         
                          VERONICA
           I don't get it.
                         
           Celeste and Jesse stop.
                         
                          CELESTE
           It's stupid.
                         
           Veronica is looking at Celete's food.
                         
                          VERONICA
           Oh, the foods out. (to Celeste) See
           you on the dance floor? Watch out
           for Tucker though.
                         
                         
           They leave Celeste, standing alone, smiling. She bites into
           the carrot.
                         
                         
          94 INT. WEDDING TENT-LATER 94
                         
           We see a raucous wedding dance floor. Everyone's dancing:
           Beth, Tucker, their families, their friends, Jesse, Veronica,
           Scott, etc. They are doing wedding dances. Celeste sits at
           her table, watching with a smile. It is bittersweet for her.
           She drinks a martini. Alone.
                         
                         
          95 INT. PAUL'S CONDO-NIGHT 95
                         
           Celeste and Paul are playing scrabble and drinking wine.
                         
                          PAUL
           (keeping score on a notepad) So,
           that's 38 points plus 50 bonus
           points for using all my tiles so...
                         
                          CELESTE
           Wait, wait, wait. I think I may
           have to challenge. Zooecia?? That's
           not a word, that's my hoochie
           cousin's name!
                         
                          PAUL
           Are you challenging or not?
                         
                          CELESTE
           Yes, I definitely am.
           97.
                         
                         
                          PAUL
           Well, I will tell you that Zooecia
           is a sac secreted by a compound
           organism but here you go. (he hands
           her the Scrabble dictionary) Look
           for yourself.
                         
           Celeste finds the word, reads the definition and silently
           accepts defeat.
                         
           PAUL (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Ha ha! I go again.
                         
                          CELESTE
           I've never lost a game of Scrabble
           in my life.
                         
                          PAUL
           Well, nothing lasts forever.
                         
                         
          96 INT. PAUL'S LIVING ROOM- LATER 96
                         
           Celeste and Paul are making out on the couch.
                         
                          PAUL
           I'm so sorry I beat you in
           Scrabble.
                         
                          CELESTE
           No you're not.
                         
                          PAUL
           You're right, I'm not.
                         
           The making out gets a little hotter. Celeste is aggressive.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Will you get a condom?
                         
                          PAUL
           Uh...I don't think we should...
                         
                          CELESTE
           No, you're using a condom.
                         
                          PAUL
           No, I don't think we should sleep
           together.
                         
           Celeste pulls away from him.
                         
                          CELESTE
           What?
           98.
                         
                         
                          PAUL
           I just...I don't know.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Are you not into it?
                         
                          PAUL
           No, no believe me, I'm into it.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Then, what's the deal?
                         
                          PAUL
           I really like you.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Right, I'm confused...why not sleep
           with me then?
                         
                          PAUL
           Because I think I might really like
           you.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Oh. (further realizing) Oh. Okay.
           Well, I like you too.
                         
           Celeste looks distant.
                         
                         
          97 INT. L.A. NIGHTCLUB-NIGHT 97
                         
           Celeste is at a loud, trendy club. She sits next to Riley.
           They have to shout to be heard.
                         
                          RILEY
           THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE MOST
           EMBARRASSING SPEECH EVER! HOW WILL
           SHOW YOUR FACE TO YOUR FRIENDS EVER
           AGAIN?
                         
                          CELESTE
           ACTUALLY, WEIRDLY, I'M KINDA HAPPY
           I DID IT. I FEEL BETTER SOMEHOW.
                         
                          RILEY
           WELL GOOD FOR YOU THEN.
                         
           Celeste looks around at lots of men, grinding each other with
           whistles in their mouth and drinks in their hands.
                         
                          CELESTE
           THE GAYS REALLY KNOW HOW TO PARTY,
           HUH?
           99.
                         
                         
                          RILEY
           WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
                         
          Celeste just looks at her like, "Oh you poor, sheltered
          Disney princess. Are you serious?"
                         
                          CELESTE
           THIS IS A GAY CLUB.
                         
                          RILEY
           IT'S OPENING NIGHT HERE. IT DOESN'T
           KNOW WHAT IT IS YET.
                         
          Still nothing from Riley.
                         
                          CELESTE
           RILEY, THE CLUB IS CALLED SWALLOW.
                         
          Riley looks around and takes it in. Aha, right. Celeste
          looks out amongst the crowd. Just then, two beefy, waxed,
          tanned, well-groomed gay men walk up to Celeste.
                         
                          GAY MAN
           Excuse me, can you please tell your
           friend Riley that we worship her??
                         
                          GAY MAN #2
           OMG, she's so pretty!
                         
                          CELESTE
           Sure...
                         
          Celeste notices that they are both wearing the Riley Banks t-
          shirts, made for pre-teens, with the cock-in-the-butt mistake
          in the logo. She points at it.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Wait, are you aware that the logo
           is...
                         
                          GAY MAN #2
           A dick in a butt? Yeahhh!
                         
                          GAY MAN
           It's amazing. All of our friends
           are rocking it. It's like the gay
           Izod.
                         
          The gay man points to a group of his friends on the dance
          floor, ALL wearing Riley Banks gear, some of them have even
          made their own t-shirts with the cock in the butt logo
          magnified.
           100.
                         
                         
                          CELESTE
           Wow, so, what, you just buy the
           biggest size they make?
                         
                          GAY MAN
           How dare you, I'm a size 10 in
           tween. I have a slight frame.
                         
           They walk away, offended. Celeste turns to Riley. She is
           being adored by gay men.
                         
                          RILEY
           I LOVE IT HERE!!
                         
           Celeste has a big idea.

                          CELESTE
           Tweens don't want her anymore. But
           the gays do! Ten percent of
           Americans are gay, Scott. You're
           gay, start thinking gay. Gay Izod.
           She could be Lady Gaga by the end
           of the year. Huge market.
                         
                          SCOTT
           Wow, you might have just turned the
           cock in the butt around.
                         
                          CELESTE
           We WILL make the cock in the butt
           work for us. The cock in the butt
           will be huge!
                         
           Just then, a mom and two small children walk by her, overhear
           her dirty mouth and glare at her. She waves at them self-
           consciously.

           Celeste is shopping for a dresser. She is talking to a
           salesperson.
                         
                          SALESMAN
           So, it comes with directions and
           it's actually really easy to
           assemble.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Look, you do not know me. I do not
           want to assemble. Trust me, you do
           not want me to assemble. Bad things
           happen. Could I just take the floor
           model? I'll hook you up.
                         
                          SALESMAN
           Lemme go ask my manager.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Thanks, dude.
                         
           Celeste is browsing and spots Veronica with a shopping cart
           filled with baby stuff. She approaches her.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Veronica? Hey, Celeste.
                         
                          VERONICA
           Of course, yeah, hi! What are you
           doing?
                         
                          CELESTE
           Oh, I'm getting a dresser. You?
                         
                          VERONICA
           Oh, you know getting...
                         
           VERONICA (CONT'D) CELESTE
           Baby stuff. Baby stuff.
                         
           VERONICA (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Beth is uh...throwing me a baby
           shower? So I have to register.
           102.
                         
                         
                          CELESTE
           She is?
                         
          Celeste swallows this.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           That's uh...really nice.
                         
                          VERONICA
           Very. And so helpful right now.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Of course. (laughs nervously) Well,
           looks like you're really organized.
                         
                          VERONICA
           Organized, terrified.
                         
                          CELESTE
           You'll do great.
                         
                          VERONICA
           Thanks. I hope so.
                         
          They share an awkward moment.
                         
           VERONICA (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Listen, I never got a chance to
           just tell you I'm so sorry about
           all this. Trust me, I didn't
           expect...
                         
                          CELESTE
           No, don't. Really. There's nothing
           to apologize for. I'm the one who's
           sorry. I mean, I dug through your
           trash.
                         
          Celeste laughs.
                         
                          VERONICA
           Look, I don't blame you. For
           anything. This has all been so
           weird. Everything happened really
           fast.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Yeah, it did. But everything will
           work out. I know it. Jesse's book
           is coming out...
                         
                          VERONICA
           He's so talented.
           103.
                         
                         
           A beat.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Yeah, he is.
                         
           An awkward silence.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Well, good luck. Nice to see you.
                         
                          VERONICA
           You too.
                         
           They both steer their carts towards each other in opposite
           directions but bump right into each other.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Oh sorry!
                         
                          VERONICA
           Oh, it's okay! Bye again.

           Celeste and Paul are in a private karaoke room. Paul is
           belting his heart out, singing Boyz II Men, "On Bended Knee."
           Celeste is loving it. She has her own mike and pipes in once
           in a while with a harmony.
                         
                          PAUL
           Can somebody tell me how to get
           things back the way they used to
           be...oh God give me a reason, I'm
           down on bended knee..ooohohhh ooooh
                         
                          CELESTE
           Ooohh ohhh. Til you come back to
           me..
                         
                          PAUL
           I'm down on bended knee hee hee
           hee.
                         
           They finish with a huge applause for themselves and toast
           with beers.
                         
           PAUL (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           I think we're really good.
                         
                          CELESTE
           No, we ARE really good.
           104.
                         
                         
          Celeste punches in the numbers for the next song. It's
          "Islands in the Stream," made popular by Kenny Rogers and
          Dolly Parton.
                         
                          PAUL
           Aw shit!
                         
                          CELESTE
           Get ready. You're first.
                         
                          PAUL
           Baby when I met you, there was
           peace on earth, I set out get you
           with a fine tooth comb. I was soft
           inside. Soft inside? What the fuck?
                         
                          CELESTE
           Shhh come on. Focus.
                         
                          PAUL
           You do something to me, that I
           can't explain, hold me closer, and
           I feel no pain. Tender love is
           blind, it requires a dedication.
                         
          Celeste and Paul sing in harmony.
                         
                          CELESTE PAUL
          Honest love, we feel, needs Honest love, we feel, needs
          conversation. And we ride it conversation. And we ride it
          it together, uh huh... it together, uh huh...
                         
          Celeste slowly drops her mike. Paul is still singing.
                         
                          CELESTE
           (quietly) I can't.
                         
                          PAUL
           What? Come on, we're so good
           together. Islands in the stream,
           that is what we are. Get in there!!
           This is my favorite part!
                         
                          CELESTE
           No. I can't.
                         
                          PAUL
           I know I'm pitchy but I'm finding
           it. Sail away with me...
                         
                          CELESTE
           No. This. Us. I'm sorry.
                         
          Paul slowly drops his mike.
           105.
                         
                         
                          PAUL
           What do you mean?
                         
                          CELESTE
           I just...can't.
                         
                          PAUL
           Are you serious? Oh no. Why?
                         
          He sits down on the couch. The music is still playing in the
          background.
                         
                          CELESTE
           I think I need to be alone? I'm not
           ready. I'm having fun and I feel
           like I'm beginning to like you and
           I just don't think I'm ready for
           that.
                         
                          PAUL
           What? Really?
                         
          Celeste doesn't say anything.
                         
           PAUL (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Wow, you're breaking my heart.
                         
                          CELESTE
           I'm so sorry. You are so...great.
           But I'm getting divorced.
                         
                          PAUL
           Celeste, I know.
                         
                          CELESTE
           I think I need to go through this
           alone.
                         
                          PAUL
           Yeah. Yeah, okay. I respect that.
           Live by will, not by force.
                         
                          CELESTE
           What?
                         
                          PAUL
           You're only ready when you're
           ready, you know? Don't force it.
           It's just some yoga shit.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Thanks.
           106.
                         
                         
                          PAUL
           But I do like you. I like you a
           lot. And when you are ready, if
           you're ready, call me.
                         
                         
                         
          101 INT. STEIN, WEINBERG, STEINBERG & JIMENEZ LAW FIRM - 101
                          AFTERNOON
                         
           Celeste and Jesse sit across from each other with their
           respective lawyers. They are both dressed very well. The
           atmosphere is formal, tense. There is not a lot of talking
           but there is a lot of loud paper shuffling and ball point
           pens. CELESTE'S LAWYER, male, 40, speaks:
                         
                          CELESTE'S LAWYER
           Sign here. And here. And here.
                         
           Celeste looks up, makes eye contact with Jesse and smiles
           uncomfortably.
                         
           CELESTE'S LAWYER (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           And here. Here. Yup. Aaaaaand
           here. Here. Couple more. Here...
                         
           Celeste is still signing. She looks at Jesse again, who is
           straightening his tie.
                         
                          CELESTE
           I like that tie.
                         
                          JESSE
           Oh, thank you.
                         
                          CELESTE'S LAWYER
           One more here.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Is it made out of organic mung
           beans?
                         
           Jesse nods and chuckles.
                         
                          JESSE
           No, I actually found it digging
           through your trash.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Ohhh, I see. All right.
                         
           They've broken the tension. But it's still silent. Then
           Jesse chortles. It sounds like a baby pig. It makes Celeste
           laugh.
           107.
                         
                         
           Now, both Celeste and Jesse are silently cracking up, doubled
           over as their lawyers sit there, watching them, perplexed.
                         
                         
                         
          102 EXT. STEIN, WEINBERG, STEINBERG & JIMENEZ LAW FIRM - 102
           A LITTLE LATER
                         
           Celeste and Jesse walk out of the building.
                         
                          JESSE
           So...we're divorced!
                         
           They high five. What are you supposed to do when you get
           divorced.
                         
                          CELESTE
           We did it.
                         
                          JESSE
           You wanna walk for a couple
           minutes?
                         
                          CELESTE
           Sure.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          103 EXT. LACMA- SUNDOWN 103
                         
           Celeste and Jesse are now approaching the front of "Urban
           Light," the installation from the beginning of the movie.
           The street lamps are now illuminated. She takes a seat on a
           step. Jesse sits next to her. She refers to the lamps:
                         
                          CELESTE
           These are beautiful.
                         
                          JESSE
           I thought you hated them.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Yeah, well, I've never seen them at
           night.
                         
           Jesse looks at the lamps and takes them in. He looks pretty
           sad.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           What's up with you? I know we just
           got divorced but no one died,
           right?
           108.
                         
                         
                          JESSE
           I'm just feeling like maybe you
           were right. I am a fuck up. I
           don't know what I'm doing. My
           girlfriend left.
                         
          There is a long pause.
                         
                          CELESTE
           What? Veronica? Left where?
                         
                          JESSE
           Left me. She wanted me to tell her
           everything was gonna be okay and I
           couldn't. I don't know why but I
           just...couldn't. She wants to go
           back to Brussels.
                         
          Another monumental pause. Jesse's eyes start tearing up.
                         
           JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Okay, you can say it now. You were
           right, I blew it. Just say it.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Hey...don't do that.
                         
                          JESSE
           Do what?
                         
                          CELESTE
           You are not a loser. You never
           were. You took a chance. I admire
           that and I believe in you.
                         
                          JESSE
           You do?
                         
                          CELESTE
           I do. And I want to thank you.
                         
                          JESSE
           For what?
                         
                          CELESTE
           For never being the person I wanted
           you to be.
                         
                          JESSE
           Oh, you're welcome.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Go get her.
           109.
                         
                         
                          JESSE
           But I don't know if everything is
           gonna be all right.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Well, who does? Do you love her?
                         
          Jesse looks at Celeste.
                         
                          JESSE
           I do.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Then it's worth fighting for.
                         
                          JESSE
           Okay. Okay.
                         
          Celeste smiles with tears in her eyes.
                         
                          CELESTE
           God, I finally understand why you
           fucking cry all the time. Shit is
           emotional.
                         
          They share a laugh. Then, they sit in silence for a beat.
                         
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           You deserve to be happy. And I wish
           that for you, always.
                         
                          JESSE
           Me too.
                         
                          CELESTE
           So...I guess we were right.
                         
                          JESSE
           Huh?
                         
          Celeste makes the "C and J" hand gesture from the high school
          photo in the opening montage. Jesse makes it back. They
          smile.
                         
           JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           I love you.
                         
          He kisses her on the lips. For the last time. And then, he's
          gone.
                         
                          CELESTE
           I love you too.
           110.
                         
                         
           Celeste sits awhile and looks up at the sky.
                         
                         
          104 INT. CELESTE'S PRIUS- NEXT DAY 104
                         
           Celeste drives and dials a number on her bluetooth.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Hey. So, you're probably giving
           your card to some girl in yoga
           right now. But if that doesn't work
           out for you...I think I may be
           ready. To beat you in Scrabble.
                         
                         
          105 EXT. GAS STATION- A MOMENT LATER 105
                         
           Celeste runs in to pay for gas. She is on her Blackberry.
                         
                         
          106 INT. GAS STATION MART 106
                         
           Celeste stands in line with some gum and water. A young man
           blatantly cuts in front of her with a gallon of water. Old
           Celeste returns for a moment.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Excuse me, sir?
                         
           The young man turns around. Celeste realizes she's no longer
           this person. She restrains herself.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Nothing.
                         
           Celeste takes in how she has changed. She smiles a little.
           The young man turns back to her.
                         
                          YOUNG MAN
           Hey, I'm sorry for cutting. My
           dog's in the car and he's really
           thirsty. So, thanks.
                         
                          CELESTE
           No problem.
                         
           She smiles again. The world feels bigger now.
                         
                         
                          FADE OUT
