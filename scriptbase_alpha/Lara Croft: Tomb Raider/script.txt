INT. BOARDING SCHOOL - LIBRARY - DAY

LARA CROFT (16), a headstrong, long-haired beauty, is surrounded at a
study table by her UNIFORMED CLASSMATES, one of which, DELIA, is the
group skeptic.

Chyron: London, 1986

                    LARA
          First of all Delia, my father is
          much younger than he looks. And
          second of all, you're completely
          missing the point.

A LIBRARIAN across the way shushes the girls, forcing Lara to lower
her voice to a dramatic whisper:

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          Once my father got inside Ghengis
          Khan's tomb, he thought he was home
          free.

                                        BACK TO:

INT. GHENGIS KHAN'S TOMB - DAY

Revealed in Lord Croft's FLASHLIGHT is Khan's decrepit MUMMY.
Clutching a crudely-fashioned CEREMONIAL DRUM.

                    LARA (V.O.)
          But as soon as he took the sacred
          drum from Khan's bony clutches...

Lord Croft admires his prize stolen from the mummy.

                    LARA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          He set off the worst trap of all.

Lord Croft reacts to a RUMBLING inside the tomb. The very floor
beneath him is buckling from some unseen force. Racing for the arched
doorway, Lord Croft stops when he sees:

POV - LORD CROFT

Sections of the antechamber's tile floor are falling away, dropping
down into an INFINITE ABYSS now exposed.

BACK TO SCENE

Lord Croft takes a deep breath. Picks out the only route imaginable
across the precarious checkerboard floor...and sprints for the entry
hole, drum cradled in his arms!

With each step the tile floor breaks away beneath him! Forcing Lord
Croft to snatch the drum in his teeth...and leap for the entry hole
with both hands!

                    LARA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Then, just as the wall was giving
          way...

Lord Croft claws desperately at the crumbling wall. Eyes widening with
rlief when a WIRE LADDER dangles into view.

                    LARA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          My mother came to the rescue again.

INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

LADY VIVIAN CROFT, a spirited 40-something woman who expertly helms
the family chopper. Lady Vivian stares down at the mountainside ENTRY
HOLE where Lord Croft is climbing to safety on the wire ladder
attached to the helicopter's underbelly.

                    LARA (V.O.)
          There was still one problem. And it
          was a big one: the Mongolian Army.

Lady Vivian notices DOZENS OF MONGOL SOLDIERS cresting the
mountaintop. Armed to the teeth. Sights on Lord Croft.

EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY

Hanging on with one hand to the wire ladder, Lord Croft uses his spare
hand to unload an endless UZI CLIP on the soldiers.

                    DELIA (V.O.)
          I don't buy it for a minute.

INT. BOARDING SCHOOL - LIBRARY -DAY

All eyes are on Delia as she tries to debunk Lara's story.

                    DELIA
          If that drum is so bloody valuable,
          why'd your parents send it to you?

All eyes now turn back to Lara as she returns the volley:

                    LARA
          Easy. If you were the Mongolian Army
          wouldn't my dorm room be the last
          place you'd look?

While Delia mulls that one, Lara spots a black BENTLEY ARNAGE arriving
in the parking lot outside. Her eyes suddenly beam.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          To be continued. I gotta go.

Lara races away without explanation.

INT. LARA'S BOARDING SCHOOL ROOM - DAY

PAN ACROSS a floor-to-ceiling bookcase filled with odd SOUVENIRS from
around the world, all lovingly displayed. As a woman's hand removes
one of the souvenirs we meet LADY VIVIAN CROFT in her formal, elegant,
real-world attire.

                    LADY VIVIAN
          Look at this, Desmond. Every little
          trinket we've sent back she's got on
          display like the Crown Jewels.

LORD DESMOND CROFT is a stately business magnate but hardly a tomb
raider. Unlike his wife, Lord Croft is far more interested in the OLD
TRUNK across the room, overflowing with sports trophies, plus various
academic plaques and certificates. He examines a "1st Place"
GYMNASTICS TROPHY.

                    LORD CROFT
          Viv, I don't think our little girl's
          ever come in second.

Lara bolts inside, winded from her run across school.

                    LARA
          I don't believe it...

Lord Croft gives Lara a short, polite embrace.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          I thought you two were off on
          pressing business somewhere?

Lady Vivian holds onto her daughter a little longer.

                    LADY VIVIAN
          Lara, you didn't really think we'd
          miss your 16th birthday?

                    LARA
               (plays dumb)
          Oh, is that today?

Both her parents chuckle at Lara's wit.

                    LADY VIVIAN
          We brought another souvenir to add
          to your very impressive collection.

Lord Croft hands Lara a small, unwrapped BOX. Pulling off the lid,
Lara's face scrunches quizzically: a new passport.

                    LORD CROFT
          Someday it'll be filled cover-to-
          cover, just like ours.

He looks at Lady Vivian, who nods in agreement.

                    LADY VIVIAN
          Well I think we should break it in,
          don't you, Desmond?

                    LARA
               (suspicious but hopeful)
          What are you saying, Mother?

                    LORD CROFT
          The provost has assured us you're so
          far ahead in your studies that your
          professors will actually welcome
          your absence for a week. So they
          can catch up to you.

                    LARA
          A family trip!? Where're we going?

                    LORD CROFT
          Anywhere in the world.

                    LADY VIVIAN
          It's your choice, Lara.

What a tough decision for Lara, who thoughtfully peruses all the
exotic souvenirs her parents have sent her over the years.

                    LARA
          Everywhere you've been...I've
          dreamed of going.

Lara finally settles on the TIBETAN DRUM (from Lara's story), then
turns to her parents and smiles. Decision made.

                                        CUT TO:

EXT. OVER THE HIMALAYAS - DAY

A sleek Gulfstream III -- emblazoned with "CROFT INDUSTRIES" -- soars
through the jagged, pristine white mountaintops.

Chyron: Over the Himalayas

                    LARA (V.O.)
          I want to ski Mount Annapurna. No
          one's ever skied there before.

                    LADY VIVIAN (V.O.)
          Lara, do you even know how to ski?

                    LARA (V.O.)
          That's the fun of it -- I'll learn.

INT. CROFT JET - CONTINUOUS

Lara sits on the floor (dressed in an almost tomboyish manner), her
back against a small sofa from where Lady Vivian enjoys braiding her
daughter's long, lustrous hair. They're more like sisters with their
similar mannerisms and matching DIAMOND TENNIS BRACELETS. Lara
charmingly rattles off historical facts to impress her parents.

                    LARA
          Bet you didn't know Mount
          Annapurna's actually a massif with
          two primary peaks. Annapurna 1, the
          tallest, wasn't climbed from the
          south -- where we're going to ski --
          until 1970 by the Chris Bonnington
          expedition.

The jet's handsomely appointed interior has the feel of an English
sitting room that comfortably accommodates 8-10 passengers. Lord
Croft, who has to duck inside the cabin, pours himself a nip of brandy
at the wet bar.

                    LORD CROFT
          Anything you don't know, Lara?

                    LARA
               (teasing)
          I suppose it's possible, Father.

Lord Croft smirks as he takes a seat across from his women.

                    LADY VIVIAN
          Tell us about that drum I sent you
          back from Tibet?

                    LARA
          It's made from a human thigh bone.
          And it's part of an exorcism ritual.
          That's really all I know.

                    LADY VIVIAN
          I attended the ritual once. Last
          time we were here, while your father
          was concluding a deal in Nepal.

This gets Lara's attention. And Lord Croft's.

                    LADY VIVIAN (CONT'D)
          It was very moving. The ceremony
          divests the dying person of all
          their ego and emotions, preparing
          them for the next life,
          unencumbered.

                    LORD CROFT
          I always miss the good stuff.

Lord Croft swigs the last of his brandy. Lara peers out the window at
the enigmatic mountains while confessing:

                    LARA
          You want to know something funny...?
          For years now I've told stories at
          school about my parents being famous
          tomb raiders -- that's how I
          explained why you were always away
          on business.
               (turns back to parents)
          My friends actually think all those
          souvenirs you sent me, they're all
          ancient treasures. Like that drum,
          I've almost convinced them father
          stole it from Ghengis Kahn's tomb.

Lord Croft gets a CHUCKLE over that one. But Lady Croft is not amused,
seeing beneath her daughter's imagination.

                    LADY VIVIAN
          I know it's not been easy for you,
          Lara, what with us abroad so often.
          But from now on, we'll do better
          than just holiday visits. How does a
          family trip each month sound?

Lara looks to her father, who concedes his approval.

                    LARA
          I can't wait for next month.

                                        CUT TO:

EXT. CROFT JET - LATER

LIGHTNING strikes in the darkening distance. The Gulfstream jet
disappears into a swirling miasma of low, dark clouds.

INT. CROFT JET - CONTINUOUS

The aircraft begins to shudder and sway in the turbulence. Lara looks
anxiously to her parents as a SPEAKER in the cabin squawks to life,
one of the pilots addressing the Crofts:

                    PILOT (OVER SPEAKER)
          Nothing to worry about, folks. Just
          some temperamental weather. Strap
          yourselves in tight and we'll be
          through this in no time.

Lara glances nervously out her misted window at the storm, jumping as
LIGHTNING strikes the wing of the jet! The interior LIGHTS FLICKER.
The jet drops sudden altitude...then stabilizes. The Crofts all exhale
in momentary relief.

Lord Croft unbuckles his seatbelt and heads for the cockpit.

                    LADY VIVIAN
          Desmond?

                    LORD CROFT
          You girls stay put.

Lady Vivian clutches Lara's hand with her own.

INT. CROFT JET - COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

The TWO PILOTS, struggling to hold onto the shaking controls,
acknowledge Lord Croft as he slips in through the partition.

                    LORD CROFT
          Anything I can do?

                    PILOT #1
          There's a portable radio in the
          closet. Better get it out.

                    LORD CROFT
               (steps closer)
          What's wrong with those dials?

                    PILOT #2
          We've lost primary power, Sir.
               (beat)
          She's going down.

His jaw slackening, Lord Croft stares out the windscreen...

                    LORD CROFT
          Good God.

POV - LORD CROFT

Through a sudden break in the clouds appear two oncoming mountaintops.
An unavoidable obstacle.

EXT. CROFT JET - CONTINUOUS

The aircraft continues its inexorable course right between two craggy
peaks...SHEARING OFF THE ENTIRE LEFT WING!

INT. CROFT JET - CONTINUOUS

Chaos ensues as the jet begins a slow barrel roll, emptying overhead
bins and closets. Lady Vivian cradles Lara tightly to her bosom,
shielding her daughter as best she can before --

-- SMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASH! The jet SLAMS into the ground with such
force the fuselage CRACKS in several places. A piece of the fuselage
strikes Lady Vivian in the head!

EXT. CROFT JET - CONTINUOUS

Plowing across the snowy terrain like a runaway train -- OBLITERATING
ALL TREES in its path -- the jet finally comes to precarious rest,
UPSIDE DOWN, bridging a deep chasm.

INT. CROFT JET - CONTINUOUS

CU - LARA hanging upside down in her seat. Unconscious.

CRAAAAAAAAAK!!! The already split fuselage breaks further under the
strain of its own weight.

This rouses Lara, who struggles to orient herself. Her eyes focus in
on her mother crumpled and bleeding. Lara unbuckles her safety belt
and falls to the inverted ceiling. Scrambling through the chaotic
cabin Lara desperately cradles her mother.

                    LARA
          Mother. Mother please. Please be
          okay.

Lady Vivian's eyes flicker with dying life. Lara rambles:

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          I'm so sorry. I should've picked
          someplace else. We never should've
          come here. Never, ever...

Lady Vivian reaches a trembling hand up to Lara's face, gently wiping
away the tears streaking down her flushed cheeks.

                    LADY VIVIAN
          Always follow your dreams, dear.
               (last breath)
          Always...

Lady Vivian expires in her daughter's arms and Lara's sobbing gives
way to an emotional torrent of tears until --

-- CRAAAAAAAAAK!!!

The fuselage breaks further, threatening to snap the jet right in
half. Jolted from her misery, Lara peers out the jet window with wide
eyes:

POV - LARA

It's a 1000 stomach-turning feet to the bottom of the chasm.

BACK TO SCENE

Lara hears the sounds of a man GROANING somewhere near.

                    LARA FATHER!?

INT. CROFT JET - COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

Lara rushes into the upended cockpit where both pilots hang dead in
their seats -- the windscreen has been shattered. Lara sees her
father's feet, his body covered with a collapsed section of the
interior.

                    LARA
          Father can you hear me!?

Lara frantically extricates her father, who is groaning in pain from
the COMPOUND FRACTURE of his left leg.

                    LORD CROFT
          Vivian...where's my Vivian?

-- CRAAAAAAAAAK!!! The fuselage breaks further, increasing the incline
inside the doomed jet.

                    LARA
          Come on, we've got to get you out!

Lara starts helping her father up towards the windscreen. Pushing him
through the jagged orifice, Lara watches her father topple safely onto
the snowy chasm bank. Lara starts out herself, then smartly realizes:

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          Supplies. We need supplies.

Moving back to the closet, Lara starts gathering essentials (ie:
MEDKIT, SKIS, FLARE GUN, etc.) All the while the metal fuselage WHINES
under the tremendous strain...portending --

-- CRAAAAAAAAAK!!! This break causes Lara to fumble the flare gun.
Hanging on, she strains to reach the weapon...

                    LORD CROFT (O.S.)
          LARA GET OUT!!!

Stretching that extra inch, Lara secures the flare gun.

EXT. HIMALAYAS - CONTINUOUS

All the supplies, flung through the windscreen, land in the snow
around Lord Croft, who's anxiously watching for...

LARA DIVES THROUGH THE WINDSCREEN as the jet snaps in half! She tucks
& rolls safely in the snow, showing off some well-honed gymnastics
moves. Together, Lara and Lord Croft watch in stunned silence as the
jet fuselage CRACKS once more and, with her dead mother aboard,
plummets into the chasm.

Lara steps right up to the dangerous edge, tragic witness to the jet
EXPLODING IN A FIREBALL when it hits rock bottom.

                                        TIME CUT TO:

EXT. HIMALAYAS - AS NIGHT SETS IN

TRACK a long path through the snow to Lord Croft bundled up atop a
TOBOGGAN/LITTER fashioned from skis. Slowly pulling her father along
in the knee deep snow, Lara is battling hypothermia and fatigue as a
LIGHT SNOW falls.

                    LARA
               (mutters repeatedly)
          We'll be fine... We'll be fine.

Hauling her father up a slight grade, what's left of Lara's strength
is put to the test. As she feels herself reaching a breaking point,
Lara's "We'll be fine" mantra just gets louder -- she's running on
pure will power now. Finally, just as she crests the grade, about to
collapse, Lara spots a MONASTERY in the near distance below. Lara
almost smiles.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          We're gonna make it!

Her spirit refueled with hope, Lara gets a second wind. Pulling her
father along with hopeful urgency...until an ANIMAL GROWL in the
surrounding shadows stops her cold. Arming herself with a FLASHLIGHT,
Lara scans the area:

POV - LARA

The flashlight finds a BLOOD TRAIL leading from her father's leg to a
pair of SNOW LEOPARDS lurking amongst the trees.

BACK TO SCENE

Lara quickly FIRES A FLARE...which spirals into the trees, only
spooking the animals momentarily. As the leopards advance with hungry
eyes, Lara starts pulling her father as fast as her legs will carry
them to the monastery before...

A 20' PRECIPICE suddenly appears in her path! Nearly rushing blindly
off the edge, Lara and Lord Croft survey their options: predators
behind them, a dangerous jump ahead.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          Father...I don't know what to do.

                    LORD CROFT
          Save yourself, Lara. Everything
          we've worked for...your mother and
          I. You're all we have left now.

Lara eyes the snow leopards moving slowly in for the kill.

                    LARA
          I can't leave you like this!

                    LORD CROFT
          I can't make it, Lara. You can.
               (imploring)
          You must.

Forced to act fast, Lara dumps all her supplies in a pile at her feet.
With focused, unblinking eyes she rapidly examines all her resources
before grabbing up two items...

CU - A FLARE is snapped in half. Keeping one eye on the snow leopards,
Lara cleverly spreads the flash powder into a semi-circle around her
father. And just as the snow leopards lope into swift attack --

-- WHOOOOOSH! Lara ignites the powder with a LIGHTER. The waist-high
WALL OF FIRE keeps the leopards at bay. For now.

                    LORD CROFT (CONT'D)
          That's my girl.

Lara kneels beside her father, clutches his hand in hers.

                    LARA
          I'll get help, Father. Before this
          fire dies out, I swear to you.

Lord Croft watches as Lara moves away from the precipice, measuring
her steps all the way back to the fire wall. Exhaling slowly, Lara
gathers herself. Hands fall to her side; a gymnast before her routine.
Then, with quick, precision steps...Lara sprints for the edge and
leaps!

NEW ANGLE

Lara soars through the air with the grace of an eagle. But she lands
hard, somersaulting several times in the snow. Immediately she CRIES
OUT in pain, her knee badly injured.

Gritting her teeth, Lara glances back at the dwindling FLARE FIRE
protecting her father from the leopards...then starts crawling towards
the wooden monastery gates ahead.

INT. MONASTERY - NIGHT

Inside the ancient stone building a spry monk, KARAK (50), breaks his
reverent meditation at a small shrine. His wise eyes search the
candlelit shadows -- something is amiss. With uncertain purpose Karak
moves to the nearest window where he sees: Lara inching through the
snow. Ten feet from the monastery gates before finally succumbing to
exhaustion.

EXT. HIMALAYAS - MOMENTS LATER

A GROUP OF MONKS, led by Karak, circles around to the precipice from a
hidden, sloping ridge. The monks BANG POTS & KETTLES, successfully
scaring away the snow leopards.

Karak is the first to arrive at Lord Croft's side. He bends over the
motionless man, listens for a heartbeat. After a moment, Karak slowly
raises his head. His eyes tell the sad story as the flare fire quietly
dies out.

                                        DISSOLVE TO:

PRELAP the sound of drums, trumpets and bells.

EXT. MONASTARY COURTYARD - NEXT DAY

The storm has cleared. A Tibetan funeral ceremony in progress. Lord
Croft's body is swathed in a white robe atop an altar.

A handful of monks circle the dead man, performing the exorcism ritual
Lady Vivian described earlier.

REVEAL - LARA watching the ceremony from a distance, off by herself.
As one of the monks fervently bangs his drum -- a replica of her
parents' souvenir -- over her father's head, Lara turns away, unable
to endure the tragic irony.

INT. MONASTERY - DAY

With views of both Lara and the ceremony, Karak turns away from the
window, faces an older monk at his side, TONPA.

                    KARAK
          I cannot explain it, Tonpa, but I
          feel my path is being re-directed.

                    TONPA
          Your dreams.

                    KARAK
          Yes... This girl's spirit is
          precious but fragile. She needs
          guidance to fulfill her potential.

                    TONPA
          Go with her, Karak. And fulfill your
          own potential.

Karak nods respectfully and heads for the courtyard.

EXT. MONASTERY COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

Lara limps along the monastery wall as the ceremony continues. She
stops, her back to us, and stares down the sheer cliff into the fog-
enshrouded valley below. CIRCLING AROUND Lara we reveal her face, her
eyes -- nearly catatonic with grief. Melancholy classical MUSIC swells
over the fading drums. As we PULL BACK, Lara inexplicably swan dives
forward...

...and splashes into an Olympic-sized indoor pool!

                                        TRANSITION TO:

INT. THE CROFT ESTATE - YEARS LATER

LARA (29), collects DIVING BELLS as part of a training regimen
supervised by Karak, now mid-60s.

Chyron: Hampshire, 1998

When Lara finally breaks the surface with the last diving bell, Karak
clicks his stopwatch, eyebrows raised, impressed.

                    KARAK
          Two seconds better than last week.
          But you're pushing yourself too hard
          again.

                    LARA
          Still breathing, aren't I?

Lara gracefully climbs from the pool, showing off a beautifully
sculpted physique...frustratingly wrapped in a towel. This is no
longer the lonely, precocious girl we met 13 years ago; Lara has grown
into a cool, physical young woman hiding a scarred heart that has
never fully mended.

Karak follows Lara inside the sparsely decorated grand manor, stopping
at a STEREO setup surrounded by small mountains of CDs. Karak switches
the somber CLASSICAL MUSIC to HIP HOP.

                    KARAK
          You need a vacation. Change of pace.
          I've taken the liberty of providing
          a few options...

He catches up to Lara, hands her some CLUB MED BROCHURES.

                    KARAK (CONT'D)
          I've already spoken with Ruth and
          Caroline. They're very excited at
          the prospect.

                    LARA
               (not in the mood)
          I don't need another girl getaway. I
          just get so restless between jobs.
          You know that, Karak.

Karak steps in front of Lara, indicates her WOUNDED ARM.

                    KARAK
          Lara, you still haven't healed from
          your last "job." Which was less than
          three months ago.

                    LARA
               (sighs)
          Seems like three years.

                    KARAK
          You want to live on the edge, how
          about a nice trip to Los Angeles?

Lara smirks, but makes no commitment as she strides away.

                                        CUT TO:

EXT. CARIBBEAN OCEAN - DAY

A SALVAGE BOAT floats atop the choppy waters off the coast of a
distant island.

Chyron: Caribbean Ocean, near Barbados

A gray-haired Scot, DARBY ERICKSON (70), anxiously adjusts the oxygen
tanks on his-Venezuelan diver, ARTURO (35).

                    DARBY
          Remember Arturo, the chest may be
          decayed. Go eyes open for the
          hardware.

Darby shows a PHOTO of a wooden chest with GOLD ORNAMENTS.

                    DARBY (CONT'D)
          The map tube will be somewhere in
          the vicinity, if I've calculated
          right.

Arturo nods, pulls on his face mask. Darby pats him on the shoulders,
then watches him roll backwards off the boat.

UNDERWATER

FOLLOW Arturo down 30+ meters through the teeming waters to the
remnants of an ancient SHIPWRECK scattered over the coral floor. As
Arturo skims the rotting wreckage...

A GIANT MORAY EEL lunges from a crevice flashing razor teeth! Arturo
contorts his body to avoid the attack...then continues on until he
spots a GLINT OF GOLD entrenched in the coral. Upon closer inspection
it's one of the GOLD ORNAMENTS.

Arturo uses a PORTABLE JETPULSE to unsettle tne ocean floor. As the
silt begins to settle, Arturo finally locates a large, sealed GOLD MAP
TUBE half-submerged in the sand.

INT. SALVAGE BOAT DAY

CU - A MAP is delicately unrolled by rubber-gloved hands.

                    DARBY (O.S.)
          Exquisite. Perfectly preserved.

REVEAL - DARBY & ARTURO huddled inside the tiny cabin, examining a
centuries-old Spanish map atop a work table where the empty GOLD MAP
TUBE now rests.

The area charted is a crude representation of South and Central
America. Darby excitedly follows with one finger a MARKED TRAIL inland
from the coast to the Andes Mountains.

                    DARBY (CONT'D)
          There it is... El Dorado.

                    ARTURO
          Very dangerous terrain, Sir.

                    DARBY
          Don't worry, Arturo. This old bloke
          is smart enough to know his
          limitations.
               (slowly rolls up map)
          I know exactly who to call.

                    EVELYN (PRELAP)
          Lara!?

INT. CROFT ESTATE - DAY

Arriving amidst a cacophony of BARKING DOGS is Lara's unmarried
maternal Aunt, EVELYN CROFT (60), a grand dame of the London social
scene who doesn't bother knocking. Evelyn saunters into the expansive
living room, which is filled with state-of-the-art GYMNASTICS &
TRAINING EQUIPMENT.

                    EVELYN
          Lara, where are you!?

                    LARA (O.S.)
          Coming, Aunt Ev!

Lara, dressed in workout gear, is in the middle of an exercise on the
UNEVEN BARS. Her perfect dismount is a BACKFLIP/HALF-TWIST...landing a
foot in front of a startled Evelyn.

                    EVELYN
          Oh good God! Don't do that.

                    LARA
          I assume this isn't a social visit.
          You're not wearing your fur.

Evelyn ignores Lara, focusing instead on all the equipment.

                    EVELYN
          I will never get used to this
          rubbish.
               (melodramatic sigh)
          Oh, the parties your mother used to
          throw in here...black ties, gorgeous
          gowns...such a travesty.

Heard it all before, Lara heads for the kitchen.

                    EVELYN (CONT'D)
          Where are you going, Lara? This
          isn't a social visit, you know.

INT. CROFT ESTATE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

While Lara makes her favorite EGG SALAD AND PICKLES sandwich, Evelyn
nosily inspects every kitchen cabinet and cupboard.

                    EVELYN
          Granted, I am no longer your legal
          guardian. But I am still the only
          real family you've got.

Her back to Evelyn, Lara mouths her aunt's words in perfect lip sync
along with her. Clearly this is not a new speech.

                    EVELYN (CONT'D)
          I said nothing when you returned
          from Tibet with a strange monk...
          And I bit my tongue when you turned
          that living room into a gymnasium.
          But your continual resistance to
          take responsibility of the family
          affairs is becoming unacceptable.
          There is an absolute mountain of
          paperwork to be signed -- you know I
          never wanted this job. It was only
          out of respect for my dear
          brother --

Lara finally turns to interrupt her aunt's rant:

                    LARA
          I'm sorry, Aunt Ev. I promise to
          catch up by your party next week.

                    EVELYN
          Good then. That's a start.

Evelyn helps herself to the other half of Lara's sandwich.

                    EVELYN (CONT'D)
          You seem awfully pallid, child. I
          hope this is not your regular diet.

FOLLOW Lara as she rolls her eyes, walking away from it all.

                    EVELYN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          I know! How about a nice vacation?
          Club Med, perhaps?

INT. CROFT ESTATE - LARA'S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT

Clothes and books everywhere. PHOTOS of her and friends -- male and
female -- at various events (Charity Ball, Wimbledon, etc.) Lara sits
in the lotus position atop her bed cluttered with Club Med brochures.
She's watching "The African Queen" on TV while chatting on the phone
with some unseen lover.

                    LARA
          ...I'm not giving you the duck
          again, Charles. I'm just not in the
          mood for clubbing tonight.
               (pause; smirks)
          Let me remind you, I am a proper
          British girl. My ears are not
          suitable for such gutterspeak.
               (beat; teasing)
          Maybe I'll call you tomorrow.

Lara hangs up. Unable to satiate her restless mind, Lara wanders to
the bookshelf full of all those souvenirs from her parents' travels.
When Lara picks up the TIBETAN EXORCISM DRUM, we see that beneath the
tough exterior she has fashioned for herself lies the vulnerability of
a teen girl. But her reverie is broken by her BARKING GUARD DOGS
outside!

INT. CROFT ESTATE - SECURITY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Karak watches one of many MONITORS which display constantly changing
images from surveillance cameras around the estate. A London TAXICAB,
idling by the front gates, currently has Karak's undivided attention
as Lara enters, concerned.

                    KARAK
          We have a visitor.

EXT. CROFT ESTATE - MOMENTS LATER

The cab has vanished. Lara and Karak find ARTURO lying on the road
outside the front gate of the estate. Pulling the man's coat open,
Lara reveals his nasty ABDOMINAL WOUND.

                    KARAK
          I'll call an ambulance.

As Karak hurries away, Arturo hands Lara a Hi-8 VIDEO.

                    ARTURO
          This...only for...Lara.

INT. CROFT ESTATE - MEDIA ROOM - LATER

As Lara cues up the Hi-8 video in her top-of-the-line screening room,
Karak enters with dour news:

                    KARAK
          The paramedics removed the body.

This draws an exhale of remorse from Lara.

                    KARAK (CONT'D)
          I convinced the authorities to wait
          until tomorrow for your deposition.

                    LARA
          Hopefully this'll have some answers.

Lara starts the tape which plays out on a projection screen. Static
turns to a wide tripod shot of DARBY ERIKSON.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          Darby...

Clutching the empty, GOLD MAP TUBE, Darby paces a dimly lit bungalow,
speaking to the camera nervously.

                    DARBY (ON TAPE)
          Please forgive the melodrama, my
          dear, but I'm certain the phone
          lines here aren't safe. You've heard
          of El Dorado, the lost city of gold?
          Well, believe it or not, I actually
          found a map to the place. And it
          is authentic.

Darby points to the MAP, unfurled atop the nearby desk and illuminated
by a SPECIAL INFRARED LAMP.

                    DARBY (ON TAPE) (CONT'D)
          How'd I pull off this miracle, you
          ask? Using an 18th century weather
          chart I calculated a hurricane off
          Barbados about the same time a
          spanish galleon -- the San Roque --
          turned up missing in 1784.
               (deep breath)
          That's the good news. Bad news is,
          turns out the Aussie bloke who hired
          me is a second cousin to the Devil
          himself. I told him I couldn't find
          the map but he didn't buy it for a
          minute. And it's only a matter of
          time before he tracks me down. Which
          is where you come in, my dear.

Darby steps closer to the camera, desperation in his voice.

                    DARBY (CONT'D)
          Now I know you're a cash up front
          girl, but if all the legends about
          El Dorado are true, I'm offering you
          a 50-50 split on what could be
          billions in gold. I should think
          that'll do your charity Foundation
          right proud.

Arturo, at the far window, reacts to oncoming HEADLIGHTS.

                    ARTURO
          Someone's coming.

Darby acts quickly, returning the map to its gold tube.

                    DARBY
          Lara, I can't do this without you.
          If you're game, meet me on the 7th
          in Curacao. I'll be at the El Mar
          under the name Flannigan.

The sound of MEN APPROACHING cause Darby and Arturo to urgently
discuss evacuation plans in hushed tones. LOUD POUNDING on the door
brings a warning:

                    LARSEN (O.S.)
          OPEN UP! WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE!

REACTION SHOTS: Lara and Karak are on the edge of their seats.

While Darby climbs out a side window, Arturo shoves the heavy DRESSER
against the door but --

-- KABLAAAAAMBLAAAMBLAAAMBLAAM!!! The door and dresser splinter in a
hail of SHOTGUN BLASTS. Arturo goes spinning to the floor, wounded.

What's left of the dresser and door are pushed aside as SIX AUSSIES
hefting 12 GAUGE PUMP-ACTION SHOTGUNS enter the room. Muscular, bald
LARSEN, the most malevolent of the Aussies, informs his unseen boss:

                    LARSEN (CONT'D)
          The geezer got away...

A seventh man enters last. This is CHRISTIAN MALVERN (40s), a
formidable, lantern-jawed Australian businessman. He calmly strolls
through the debris over to the OPEN SIDE WINDOW.

                    LARSEN (CONT'D)
          Left his little troll behind,
          though.

Malvern turns his attention on Arturo, who is writhing on the floor in
pain; a jagged WOOD SHARD has impaled itself deep in his abdomen.
Malvern looms over Arturo, cruelly stepping down on the shard with his
boot.

REACTION SHOTS: Karak looks away in disgust; Lara stares on in anger,
clutching the TV remote like a weapon.

                    MALVERN
          Tell me where I can find Erikson.

Arturo grits his teeth in agony as Malvern twists the shard.

                    ARTURO
               (hisses defiantly)
          El Dorado.

Malvern crouches by Arturo.

                    MALVERN
          Here's why I won't kill you.
          Everything I do has a purpose, and
          whether you live or die means
          absolutely nothing to me.
               (stands)
          I'm not above suffering, however. In
          fact, I'm a big fan of it.

SIRENS are heard approaching in the distance.

                    LARSEN
          Bastard must've called the cops!

With his boot, Malvern pushes the shard all the way into Arturo, who
WAILS in pain. As Malvern strides for the door:

                    MALVERN
          Get your men out of here, Larsen.

Larsen is the last one out of the room. He finally spots the Hi-8
camera in the corner and fires his shotgun -- KABLAM! The video cuts
to ominous static. Lara stops the tape, stands.

                    KARAK
          May I offer my opinion?

                    LARA
          I already know your opinion, Karak.

INT. CROFT ESTATE - CONTINUOUS

Karak insistently follows Lara out into the living room.

                    KARAK
          So many of your jobs become
          dangerous along the way. This one, I
          must say, looks doomed from the very
          start.

Taking an impassioned stand, Lara turns to face Karak.

                    LARA
          Darby Erikson is one of the best
          cartographers in the world. If it
          weren't for him I never would have
          found the Scion or the Dagger of
          Xi'an. Now it's my turn to help him.

                    KARAK
          Help him evade the Australian, or
          help him find El Dorado?

                    LARA
          Why both, of course.

                    KARAK
          You travel to the ends of the earth.
          You risk your life at every turn.
          What is it you're looking for, Lara?

                    LARA
          When I find it, I'll let you know.

As Lara heads upstairs, Karak mutters to himself:

                    KARAK
          Hardly the vacation I had in mind.

                                        CUT TO:

POV - UNKNOWN (THROUGH TELESCOPE)

Lara, dressed in a sun dress and combat boots, rides her vintage
Norton motorcycle and passes an engraved stone sign, "CAMBRIDGE
UNIVERSITY." WE HEAR male voices:

                    VOICE #1 (O.S.)
          Oh Christ, I don't think she's
          wearing a bra --

                    VOICE #2
          -- Give me that!

                    VOICE #1
          Get lost, you wanker!

PULL BACK to reveal we are:

INT. CAMBRIDGE LABORATORY - NEXT DAY

Three engineering eggheads (STUART, LIAM & WESLEY) grapple over rights
to the TELESCOPE, currently controlled by Stuart.

                    STUART
          Knock it off! She's coming in!

All three young men scramble away from the window. While Stuart
stashes the telescope, Liam checks his hair in a mirror and Wesley
quickly gargles in the sink.

There's a KNOCK at the lab door, then Lara enters smiling...

                    LARA
          How're my Gadget Boys doing?

POV - LARA

Her "Gadget Boys" are now seated quietly at work stations, engineering
devices per Lara's faxed DESIGN SKETCHES. They AD LIB "Hellos."

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          Sorry I'm late. Had to give a
          deposition...

Lara strides over to Stuart, her attention already grabbed by the
circular steel PROBE he's still wiring.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          Just as I imagined it.

Stuart turns one last screw, then picks up a REMOTE CONTROL DEVICE,
which when activated...levitates the probe!

                    STUART
          Didn't have time to build it exactly
          to your specs. But I think you'll
          like it.

With Stuart controlling the probe's micro airjets, it zips across the
lab...almost taking the heads off Liam and Wesley!

                    STUART (CONT'D)
               (mischievous)
          Oops. Sorry lads.

Impressed, Lara now eyes the MONITOR on Stuart's work station.

POV - LARA

The image on the monitor is a LIVE SHOT from the remote probe as it
flies through the air...finally hovering right behind Lara...then
ZOOMING IN for a tight shot on her backside.

                    LARA (O.S.)
          Very clever, Stuart.

BACK TO SCENE

Liam confidently gestures Lara over to his work station.

                    LIAM
          Mine's even better, Lara. Come see.

He shows off a thin, lightweight chrome AIR TANK with nozzle.

                    LIAM (CONT'D)
          80 ccs of emergency oxygen, just
          like you wanted. But, when you hit
          this little button here...

A SIX FOOT FLAME SHOOTS FROM THE TANK! Nearly incinerating Stuart, who
jumps back in shock.

                    LIAM (CONT'D)
          Whoops. Stronger than I thought.

Lara pats Liam playfully on the head.

                    LARA
          Such a little firebug, aren't we?
               (beat)
          And what about you, Wesley? How did
          you get on with my shopping list?

Wesley smiles shyly at his work station where we see a spread of
CUSTOM AMMO. He breath-polishes what resembles a thick SILENCER
ATTACHMENT, then screws it onto a retro-fitted GUN.

                    WESLEY
          Multi-tasking compression assembly.
          Accommodates custom pitons, flares,
          harpoons and tranquilizer darts.

Wesley loads one of the tranq darts into the assembly.

                    WESLEY (CONT'D)
          I know how fond you are of animals.

Suddenly spinning like James Bond, Wesley levels his gun on Stuart and
Liam who both duck below their work stations.

                    WESLEY (CONT'D)
               (smiles impishly)
          Psyche.

                    LARA
          Excellent job. All of you. You
          flatter me with your brilliance.

She lays an ENVELOPE stuffed with pound notes on the table.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          Hope this covers your tuition here
          for another semester.

                    STUART
          Beats the hell outta Work Study.

As Lara collects her new gadgets into a leather SADDLEPACK:

                    LIAM
          So Lara, what're you gonna do with
          all this stuff?

                    LARA
          Love to stay and chat, guys, but
          I've got to catch an early flight
          tomorrow.

Having what she wants, Lara starts for the door...but notices the
forlorn faces of her Boys, who can't get enough of her.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          Alright, tell you what. Soon as I
          get back we'll all go out for a
          pint. Any place you want. Deal?

The boys all nod enthusiastically. And as soon as Lara exits the lab,
Stuart rushes back to his hiding place and grabs the telescope; within
seconds, the three Gadget Boys are all squabbling again for control.

                                        TIME CUT TO:

EXT. CROFT ESTATE - NIGHT

Lara cruises through the open estate gates on her motorcycle. But
halfway up the cobblestone driveway, Lara slows her motorcycle -- all
the lights are out in the grand manor!

Killing the cycle engine, Lara cautiously dismounts.

                    LARA
          Karak!?

The sound of the GATES CLOSING behind her spins Lara around. Sensing
she's about to be trapped, Lara runs for the gates, reaching them just
as they close. Suddenly feeling vulnerable, Lara rushes back for her
cycle to arm herself...only to find her saddlebag of gadgets has
disappeared!

A GUNSHOT bursts the front tire of her motorcycle! Lara ducks for
cover behind the bike, but a bright FLASHLIGHT exposes her.
Instinctively, Lara sprints in the opposite direction, away from the
light...

A blistering volley of GUNSHOTS kick up grass and dirt all around
Lara, funneling her towards the elaborate HEDGEROWS which border the
north side of the estate. Suddenly --

-- A LARGE STATUE tips over near the hedgerow entrance! Lara dives
sideways, SOMERSAULTING to safety...or so she thinks --

-- ANOTHER STATUE is nearly upon her from the other side, forcing Lara
to BACKFLIP out of the way. She steals a breath, only to see the
Statue's face EXPLODE from gunfire! Off she goes like a bullet
herself...

INSIDE THE HEDGEROWS

Lara creeps along the gravel pathway, lit only by small FOOTLAMPS. All
around her in the labyrinth she can hear FOOTSTEPS of unknown
assassins somewhere amidst the 10' hedge walls. Lara creeps quietly,
her eyes unblinking while maintaining a nearly imperceptible breathing
rhythm --

-- SHTOOOOSH! A long wooden SPEAR juts through the hedgerow nearly
impaling her. Lara jumps back...only to have a second spear block her
path! Turning to run, Lara reacts in mid-stride to yet another spear
in front of her: she dives to the ground...ROLLING HER BODY lengthwise
beneath six more jutting SPEARS...until she hits the end of the
pathway.

When the next spear jabs from the hedgerow, Lara is ready: she grasps
it quickly with both hands -- surprising her unseen attacker -- and
yanks the spear from him!

Seeing an ASSASSIN approaching her with flashlight, Lara gets a
running start down the connecting pathway...and uses the spear to
VAULT HERSELF atop the hedgerow!

ATOP THE BORDER WALL

Leaping from the hedgerow up onto the 15' border wall, Lara -- armed
with the wooden spear -- now stands atop the stone border wall
surrounding the property's perimeter.

An ASSASSIN (with a FLASHLIGHT) comes at her from one direction atop
the border wall...forcing Lara to sprint the other direction. Until
another ASSASSIN up ahead on the border wall blocks her path. Trapped
again.

As GUNSHOTS ring out Lara examines her options: It's a 15 foot jump
down to the ground, where a ROSE GARDEN will make for a very painful
landing. With the Assassins closing in fast from both directions what
will Lara do?

                                        CUT TO:

INT. CROFT ESTATE - SECURITY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

On one of the monitors we watch Lara snapping off a short end of the
spear over her knee, then jumping towards a nearby POWER LINE and
snagging it with the spear bit...riding the incline like a zip-line
safely down to her backyard!

REVEAL - KARAK watching the proceedings, sipping a cup of tea.

                    KARAK
          Impressive.

Curiously, Karak finishes his tea and leaves the room.

EXT. CROFT ESTATE - BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

Lara tries each of the rear doors. All locked. About to bust one of
the windows in with a patio chair, Lara's distracted by a FLASHLIGHT
shone in her eyes from inside the house. Then, an ominous WHOOOOSHING
sound overhead...

POV - LARA

A LARGE SATELLITE DISH falling from the manor roof! Hurtling right at
Lara...

BACK TO SCENE

Lara dives out of the way, then watches incredulously as the satellite
dish -- still attached to the roof by its THICK CABLE -- pendulums
right at her. Just as Lara drops to her knees, FLASHLIGHTS from both
sides of the backyard converge on her...

Unless she can get back up onto the border wall, Lara is seemingly
trapped once again. But as the satellite dish swings back at her, Lara
gets an idea:

Timing her jump perfectly, Lara hops onto the swinging satellite dish.
And as FOUR ASSASSINS close in below her, Lara uses the thick cable to
expertly SCALE the side of the three story manor.

ON THE ROOFTOP

Lara relaxes for a moment, catching her breath...then shocked to see
still another ASSASSIN emerging from one of the attic windows.
Avoiding the glare of his FLASHLIGHT, Lara runs to the edge of the
roof. Decision time. She can either jump for the GUEST QUARTERS roof
about 20' below her; or, she can take her chances with the assassin
advancing behind her.

Taking a deep breath, Lara measures her steps back from the roof edge.
Then, gathering herself gymnast style (as she did so many years ago in
the Himalayas), Lara runs full steam for the edge...

...but bails out at the last second! Sliding to a stop on the loose
shingles...and slipping off the edge!

As Lara dangles precariously from the rickety rain gutter:

POV - LARA

She peers DOWN at the dangerous drop below, then UP at the masked
ASSASSIN staring at her from the roof's edge.

                    LARA
               (defiant)
          I don't have the map! And I'll die
          before I sell out Darby!

                    ASSASSIN
          How very noble.

The Assassin removes his black face mask...revealing KARAK!

                    KARAK
          Let me give you a hand.

BACK TO SCENE

As the rain gutter starts to give way, Lara quickly grabs onto Karak's
hand for help back up onto the rooftop.

                    LARA
               (brushing herself off)
          I should've known this was just
          another one of your masochistic
          tests.

                    KARAK
          High marks, I must say, until you
          pulled back from this last jump.

Lara looks away, ashamed.

                    KARAK (CONT'D)
          Your knee is fine, Lara. It's your
          memories that still hold you back.

                    LARA
               (defensive)
          And what if I'd tried the jump? And
          what if I didn't make it?

Karak WHISTLES with two fingers to his lips. Within seconds, all the
outdoor FLOOD LIGHTS pop on around the property, revealing: a large
AIR MAT between the main house and guest quarters painted roughly to
blend in with the grounds.

                    KARAK
          Believe me, every precaution was
          taken. The gardening staff deserves
          a round of applause.

Lara stares down in amazement as the six member GARDENING STAFF all
wave up at her, dressed in their black assassin jumpsuits. The lights
have also exposed the WIRES and PULLEYS secretly rigging Karak's
elaborate obstacle course: the two statues are being raised back into
place on guidewires; the bullet holes were all just a network of wired
SQUIBS.

                    KARAK (CONT'D)
          Hopefully this gave you a preview of
          what dangers to expect in the Inca
          tombs you're determined to explore.

                    LARA
               (softening a little...)
          Could've done better if you hadn't
          snatched my saddlebag.

                    KARAK
          Your gadgets are only that: gadgets.
          When your life is on the line, Lara,
          you'll have to rely on your mind and
          body, not some contraption built by
          a smitten engineering student.

In no mood for lectures, Lara starts for the attic window.

                    KARAK (CONT'D)
          This house has become nothing more
          than a waystation for you, Lara. I'm
          hoping someday you will realize your
          dreams here. Where it's safe.
               (beat)
          Relatively speaking.

Lara finally turns back to Karak, an admission of his wisdom:

                    LARA
          What would I do without you, Karak?

Karak walks up to her, looks right into her eyes.

                    KARAK
          I shudder to think.

A smile warms Lara's face as she pulls Karak into a tight embrace,
bringing a smile to his face as well -- clearly this man lives for
these infrequent moments.

                                        DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. HATO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - CURACAO - DAY

A LEAR JET touches down and taxis to a stop on the runway. Lara is in
the pilot seat sporting her signature MIRROR SHADES.

INT. EL MAR HOTEL - DAY

Lara enters the modest, nautical themed lobby. Behind the front desk
is the quaint Marina. Lara moves to the front desk inquiring about
"Mr. Flannigan." Given instructions, Lara heads upstairs...

REVEAL - A BELLBOY overhearing this conversation. Walking across the
lobby, he picks up a phone and dials a number he has scribbled down on
scrap paper.

                    BELLBOY
          Hello, Mr. Malvern. You asked me to
          call and, well... Flannigan's got a
          lady friend.
               (beat)
          I'll let you know.

INT. EL MAR HOTEL - CORRIDOR - DAY

Lara reaches Darby's room and finds a "Do Not Disturb" sign hanging on
the doorknob. She knocks gently.

                    LARA
          Darby, it's Lara.

No response. But she can hear the TELEVISION on inside. Lara checks
the door and finds it surprisingly unlocked. Checking both ways first,
Lara draws a GUN and pushes the door open. No ambush waiting, so she
slips inside...

INT. EL MAR HOTEL - DARBY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The lights are out but the TV is on, tuned into a Spanish dubbed
episode of "MacGuyver."

Lara flicks the light switch, turning on a DESK LAMP near the bed. The
room has been completely ransacked. But that is not what takes Lara's
breath away...

REVEAL - DARBY sitting up on his bed, shot at close range. Frightened
eyes wide open, staring off into the void.

After a moment to digest this nasty sight, Lara takes a seat on the
edge of the bed. She grasps Darby's hand, feeling his body
temperature.

                    LARA
          Don't worry, Darby. I'll see this
          one through for you.

Lara tenderly closes the man's eyes.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          Say hello to my parents for me.

Rising, Lara begins poking around the remains of the room. Clothes,
books, charts...but nothing that resembles the map of El Dorado.
During her search Lara hears a HISSING sound.

Quickly scanning the room, she notices something unsettling:

CU - A PLASTIQUE CKARGE attached to the same electrical socket the
lamp is plugged into -- the fuse apparently activated when she turned
on the light! A fuse seconds from detonation.

NEW ANGLE

KABOOOOOOOM! As a car blows up on "MacGuyver," Lara sprints past the
TV to the balcony overlooking the marina and leaps...

...just as Darby's hotel room EXPLODES!!!

EXT. EL MAR HOTEL - MARINA - CONTINUOUS

Lara just clears some docking and splashes down in the marina. When
she bobs back up to the surface behind a boat, a crowd of GAWKERS is
already forming outside the hotel. Including the Bell Boy, who watches
briefly from a balcony off the main lobby, then disappears back
inside.

EXT. MARINA - LATER THAT NIGHT

Standing in a new change of clothes at a payphone on the pier, Lara
watches from a distance as local POLICE and FIREMEN sift through the
remains of the blown-out hotel room.

POV - LARA

The authorities have so far only recovered CHARRED BONES, being loaded
into a CORONER'S TRUCK in plastic bags.

                    KARAK (PHONE)
          Croft Residence.

BACK TO SCENE

Turning away from the ugliness, Lara reacts to Karak's voice on the
other end with a relieved sigh.

                    LARA
          Well Karak, I hate to say you told
          me so but...I didn't want you to
          worry when you saw the news about
          the explosion at the El Mar.

                                        INTERCUT WITH:

INT. CROFT ESTATE - MEDIA ROOM - DAY

Karak is seated in the dark room watching CNN on the big screen TV.

Utilizing PICTURE-IN-PICTURE mode he's also simultaneously watching
four other local and international news services via satellite. Karak
quickli mutes the TV.

                    KARAK
               (feigns indignation)
          I never watch television.

Lara rolls her eyes knowingly.

                    LARA
          Right... Anyway, whoever murdered
          Darby and took his map probably
          thinks they killed two birds with
          one stone. But it's going to take
          the authorities down here a while to
          sort out the mess. Which buys me
          some time to catch up with the
          bastards.

Lara reacts to the WARNING WHISTLE from a nearby FERRY BOAT.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          Gotta go. I'm taking a ferry to the
          mainland. I'll ring you later.

                    KARAK (PHONE)
          May I offer my opinion?

                    LARA
          Go ahead. I'm listening.

But Lara lets the payphone receiver dangle off the hook. Grabbing up
her BACKPACK, Lara rushes to catch her ferry.

HOLD ON the receiver as we hear Karak expressing his paternal point of
view.

                                        CUT TO:

A BELL BOEING 609 PROP PLANE descending vertically from the sky like a
helicopter. The roar of its twin tilt-rotors kicking up a massive DUST
STORM. We are:

EXT. FRANCISCO DE ORELLANA, PERU - DAY

A small village situated in the tropical low jungle of the Amazon
Basin and surrounded by a dense forest of cedar, rubber and cinchona
trees. Like San Francisco during the gold rush, this is a place of
dangerous desperation; the scant populace waiting for the next
opportunity to scam a naive explorer in search of the fabled golden
city, El Dorado.

Chyron: Francisco de Orellana, Peru

Malvern's well-armed battalion of six Aussies exits the Boeing 609.
Last one off is Malvern himself, now dressed for safari. He carries
Darby's GOLD MAP TUBE like a weapon.

Malvern surveys the one street town of SUPPLY SHOPS and CANTINAS --
all the locals are staring at his expedition with cautious but hopeful
eyes.

                    MALVERN
               (to Larsen)
          Buy up all the supplies in town. If
          we don't need it, burn it.

Larsen flicks his GOLD LIGHTER with a flourish.

                    LARSEN
          With pleasure.

POV - UNKNOWN

Looking through a dirty window someone watches Larsen light Malvern's
cigarette as his goons blanket the town. We hear a RADIO BROADCAST of
a San Francisco Giants baseball game.

REVERSE ANGLE

A dilapidated, Spanish-style stucco shanty with a ramshackle porch.
Peeling painted letters across the window announce: "JUNGLE GUIDE -
Boat or Plane, Good English, Cash Only."

INT. DODGE'S OFFICE - DAY

Meet NATHANIEL DODGE (39), a rugged, world-weary American ex-patriot
working out of his cubby hole office on the main street. Kicked back
in his chair, feet on the cargo crate he calls a desk, Dodge sharpens
a MACHETE while he watches Malvern approaching. When the baseball
broadcast gives way to static, Dodge bangs his old HAMM RADIO with the
knife.

                    DODGE
               (sotto; re: Malvern)
          Here comes a new radio.

The radio reception goes all to hell when Malvern pushes open the
rickety screen door and just stands there, amusedly absorbing Dodge's
spartan existence.

                    MALVERN
          Well mate, since you're the only
          guide who speaks English, I'd say
          it's your lucky day.
               (beat; extends hand)
          Christian Malvern.

Dodge leans forward, shakes Malvern's powerful, weathered hand.

                    DODGE
          Nate Dodge. How lucky we talking?

                    MALVERN
          Locals say the winds up near Lake
          Guaranita this time of year could
          snap the rotors off my birdie.

                    DODGE
          Wouldn't know. Never been crazy
          enough to take one up there.

Malvern pulls out a wad of CASH and tosses it in Dodge's lap.

                    MALVERN
          Ten grand sound crazy enough?

Dodge can't resist holding the money, fanning through the seductive
stack of US dollars.

                    DODGE
          Damn... Hate to ask how much you
          paid for your map?

                    MALVERN
               (scrutinizing)
          And what map might that be?

                    DODGE
          Anybody who comes here with their
          own militia, they've definitely got
          a map to El Dorado.

Malvern smiles: a deadly sign for him.

                    MALVERN
               (re: gold map tube)
          Believe me, Mr. Dodge, this map came
          real cheap: cost of a bullet.

                    DODGE
          So that's the going price now, huh?

                    MALVERN
          I can assure you there's one
          difference between me and every
          other crackpot who's waltzed into
          this bunghole town: I don't waste my
          time on anything less than a sure
          thing.

Dodge keeps playing with the money, weighing his options.

                    DODGE
          It's tempting, I gotta say. But it's
          the sure things that always turn out
          the bloodiest.

Tiring of Dodge's reticence, Malvern checks his watch:

                    MALVERN
          Either take my money or quit
          fondling it. I don't make offers
          twice.

Dodge hesitates, then flips the cash back to Malvern.

                    DODGE
          Think I'll quit while I'm still
          alive.

Malvern coldly eyes Dodge for a moment, then turns to leave.

                    MALVERN
          If you call this living...

                    DODGE
          Close the screen, would you?
               (beat)
          Keeps the bugs out.

After Malvern ignores him, Dodge lolls his head back, already second
guessing himself. Hearing the radio static, he whacks the old Hamm
with a pinch more vinegar; this time the reception clears, the game
audible again. Dodge smiles.

                                        CUT TO:

EXT. JUNGLE ROAD - DAY

A beat up TRANSIT BUS plods along a muddy dirt road which winds
through intermittent jungle. A changeable sign across the front of the
bus reads: "IQUITOS to FRANCISCO DE ORELLANA"

INT. BUS - DAY

Find Lara sitting in a lotus position at the back of the half-filled
bus, working intently on her customized LAPTOP, biting her lip in
girlish concentration. She has just finished uploading Darby's Hi-8
video onto her hard drive.

CU - LAPTOP: The digitized video plays with stutter framing.

                    DARBY (ON TAPE)
          Please forgive the melodrama, my
          dear, but I'm certain the phone
          lines here aren't safe. You've heard
          of El Dorado, the lost city of gold?
          Well, believe it or not, I actually
          found a map to the place. And it
          is authentic.

The video camera PANS as Darby indicates the map, unfurled atop the
desk and illuminated by a SPECIAL INFRARED LAMP.

BACK TO SCENE

Lara FREEZE FRAMES the video and employs a sophisticated ZOOM &
ENHANCE feature which actually brings the distant, blurry map into up-
front focus. Lara smiles victoriously.

                    LARA
          Ah-ha.

Lara hears TITTERING and looks up to see all the LOCAL KIDS on the bus
turned around in the seats. staring at her with fascinated eyes.

EXT. FRANCISCO DE ORELLANA - SHORT WHILE LATER

The stopped bus pulls away...revealing Lara standing in the middle of
the one street town, BACKPACK at her feet.

FOLLOW LARA as she throws her bag over one shoulder and walks towards
a SMOKE PLUME curiously snaking into the air. Allong the main street
are "Cerrado" signs in every shop window.

The town feels strangely deserted, except for the Cantina, where a
handful of LOCALS suck on cervezas -- as Lara passes, naturally the
conversations stop, all eyes fixed on her.

TEMO (25), a shifty-eyed local, is the first to his feet and makes a
beeline for Lara, flashing his cherubim smile.

                    TEMO
          Senorita need guide?

Lara keeps walking, projecting disinterest very well.

                    LARA
          I was told in Iquitos you'd have
          everything I need to go up river.

                    TEMO
          You two hours late. Everyone here
          buyed out. But if you hire Temo as
          guide, I get you supplies.

Lara finally stops, turns around and faces Temo.

                    LARA
          Very persistent, aren't you, Temo.
          How much?

Temo sizes Lara up. Very much likes what he sees.

                    TEMO
          For you...? Only five hundred.
          American. Temo carry everything.

Temo graciously takes the backpack from Lara.

                    DODGE (O.S.)
          Save you money!

REVEAL - DODGE, beer in hand, leaning against the Cantina door,
wearing a knowing smirk.

                    DODGE (CONT'D)
          Probably save your life, too.

                    TEMO
          Don't listen to Dodge. He's only
          jealous cause I here first.

Dodge sips his beer, sauntering towards Lara and Temo.

                    DODGE
          As far as scams go around here,
          Temo's got a pretty decent one. Once
          you get up river he'll sell you to
          the banditos for fair market value.
          Then trade your lingerie for a one
          nighter in Iquitos.

Lara looks at Temo, who shakes his head adamantly.

                    LARA
          How very entrepreneurial.
               (to Dodge)
          But what's to say you're not part of
          the scam as well?

Dodge finally reaches Lara and Temo, enjoying the last swig of his
beer before he responds.

                    DODGE
          Because I didn't swipe your
          bracelet.

Lara suddenly realizes her DIAMOND TENNIS BRACELET is gone. Temo drops
the backpack and takes off...

Acting quickly, Lara scoops up her backpack, takes a couple steps
after Temo...then spins and hurls the bag like a discus thrower!
Hitting Temo in the legs, tripping him up.

Before Temo can scramble back to his feet, Lara stomps one of her
hiking boots down on his back, pinning him under.

                    LARA
          Don't make me search you. I haven't
          had my Rabies shot.

Fumbling a hand through his pocket, Temo holds up the bracelet -- Lara
kicks his hand, sending the bracelet into the air, where she catches
it with ease.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          Alright Temo, game's over.

Temo picks himself up, dusts himself off. But before he leaves, he
curses and spits in the general direction of Dodge, who's gotten a
good chuckle out of this incident.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          So what's your angle, Dodge?

Dodge meanders over to Lara, clearly intrigued by her.

                    DODGE
          Twinge of conscience. It'll pass.

                    LARA
          Is that so?

                    DODGE
          Truth is I've seen a lot of crazy
          people come through here. But I've
          never seen anybody burn all the
          supplies in town just to throw off
          followers.

He indicates with a head gesture the SMOLDERING REMNANTS of a bonfire
in the dirt clearing near them.

                    DODGE (CONT'D)
          I'm guessing you're chasing his map.

                    LARA
          Got my own copy actually.

                    DODGE
          You seem to handle yourself pretty
          well, but a lot of people head up
          into those mountains looking for El
          Dorado. Most of them never come
          back.

Undeterred, Lara re-hefts her backpack and walks towards Dodge's
"JUNGLE GUIDE..." office right across the main street.

                    LARA
          I take it this is your fine
          establishment?

She glances back to Dodge.

                    DODGE
          The "Good English" give me away?

Lara opens the screen door, but stops before entering.

                    LARA
          Enough foreplay. What to do you say
          we get down to business?

                    DODGE
          What makes you think I want the job?

                    LARA
          Where there's a twinge, there's
          still hope.

Lara disappears inside, leaving Dodge to ponder his next move with an
uncertain smile.

                                        CUT TO:

EXT. NAPO RIVER - DAY

AERIAL VIEW of this slow-moving river which serpentines through the
dense Peruvian vegetation. FIND a weathered TRAWLER BOAT chugging
along upstream through a light FOG.

EXT. DODGE'S TRAWLER - DAY

Lara, clad in a wind-breaker to keep the mid-morning mist at bay,
explores the narrow deck, taking in the row of sun-bleached ALLIGATOR
JAWS nailed to the exterior cabin wall.

                    LARA
          Not exactly the Love Boat, is it?

Dodge, steering the trawler from inside his small cabin, takes his
eyes off the river ahead for only a moment.

                    DODGE
          Black Caimans. Largest gators in the
          world. Just one of the many
          obstacles between you and El Dorado.
               (calls out in Spanish)
          Watch this bend for silt piles!

DODGE'S BOATMEN (Carlos, Luiz and Paolo) are bent over the front
railing, working 20' long poles. Probing the river and shoreline
ahead. Carlos gestures to "stay right."

INT. TRAWLER CABIN - CONTINUOUS

Lara wanders into the cramped quarters decorated with strange CURIOS
and faded POLAROIDS from Dodge's numerous jungle tours.

                    LARA
          Made this trip a few times, have
          you?

                    DODGE
          This river may be the safest way
          into Ecuador, but the Napo is no
          easy woman. You've got to take her
          slow, be real gentle. Or she'll
          grind you up and spit you out.

                    LARA
          Aren't you the romantic.

                    DODGE
          Forget romance. You gotta be a
          realist down here. The search for El
          Dorado is a fool's errand. 400 years
          and millions of dollars have
          produced nothing but an impressive
          list of fatalities.

                    LARA
          I've read all the stories. But just
          because no one's found El Dorado,
          doesn't mean it's not out there.

                    DODGE
          Let me tell you a story you probably
          don't know. About ten years ago this
          National Geographic cover boy came
          down here with a sure-fire map and
          six-figure trust fund. Predicted
          he'd find El Dorado in a week...

                    LARA
               (finishes his story)
          ...three years later he'd lost his
          money and his reputation.

This draws a surprised look from Dodge.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          I remember reading about this poor
          chap when I was at Cambridge. He
          looked much different then. Quite
          dashing, actually. Always wondered
          what happened to him.

Both of them know exactly who they're talking about. With a begrudging
smile, Dodge turns his eyes back to the river.

                    DODGE
          I'll tell you what happened. He
          wised up. Finally figured out he was
          better off selling the dream than
          buying into it.

All three Boatmen start shouting urgently, but only Carlos seems to
speak English.

                    CARLOS
          Whirlpool! Whirlpool!

Dodge quickly kills the trawler's motor and warns Lara:

                    DODGE
          Better grab onto something sturdy!

As Lara locks an arm around a cabin support pole, the boat starts to
drift sideways, caught in the strong cross-currents responsible for
the WHIRLPOOL looming ahead.

                    LARA
          Can I help?

                    DODGE
          Yeah. Don't move.

Lara rolls her eyes as Dodge hurries from the cabin.

EXT. TRAWLER - CONTINUOUS

As the trawler spins helplessly around, held in the relentless spiral
of the whirlpool's vortex, Dodge moves to the front of the boat,
yelling instructions at his Boatmen.

                    DODGE
          Keep us off the shores!

Following his orders, the boatmen work frantically to push the trawler
to safety. But Paolo's POLE is suddenly wrenched from his hands by the
vicious undertow...throwing the boatman off-balance and overboard!
Carlos and Luiz start shouting.

Dodge rushes to join Carlos and Luiz at the railing, where they all
stare into the swirling water until...Paolo resurfaces gasping for
air!

                    DODGE (CONT'D)
          The poles! Give him something to
          grab!

Carlos and Luiz extend their long poles towards Paolo, who grabs
feebly for them, too distracted by:

A PAIR OF BLACK CAIMAN ALLIGATORS! Sensing easy prey. But just as the
first gator is about to reach Paolo...

Dodge whips out a serrated BOWIE KNIFE and expertly throws the blade
...skewering the Caiman in the head, killing it instantly!

But Paolo is not out of trouble yet. He loses his grip on Carlos' pole
as the trawler keeps spinning in the whirlpool. And the second gator
is closing in...

                    DODGE (CONT'D)
          Other side!

To compensate for the continual spinning, Dodge leads the two Boatmen
over to the other side of the trawler where:

LARA is already hanging bravely over the edge of the deck, her legs
clamped onto the railing.

                    LARA
          Take my hand!

A floundering Paolo reaches up and grabs onto Lara's hand while Dodge
and the two boatmen help pull them both to safety until...

THE SECOND CAIMAN LUNGES UP FROM THE MURKY WATER -- CRUUUUNCH! Massive
jaws chomp down on Paolo's forearm!

Lara and the three men topple backwards onto the deck as Paolo's awful
SCREAMS gurgle away under water. Sitting on her butt, Lara finally
realizes she is still holding Paolo's SEVERED HAND! Disgusted, she
shakes the limb loose.

Carlos and Luiz move back to the railing, staring despondently down at
the calming waters where the Caiman feeds on Paolo. Dodge angrily
picks up the hand and tosses it into the river.

                    DODGE
               (to gator)
          Might as well have the rest of it!
               (beat; to Lara)
          Add another name to the list.

Off Lara's concerned face, we;

                                        CUT TO:

EXT. LAKE GUARANTTA - DAY

At 6,000 feet overlooking the lush valley below is an inactive volcano
basin, half-filled with water. A singular WEDGE cut into one section
of the rim is testament to some explorer's long ago attempt to drain
this mysterious lake.

The water's surface begins to RIPPLE. The portentous sound of JET
ENGINES spoils the tranquility as Malvern's Bell-Boeing rises unevenly
above the basin rim.

                    LARSEN (O.S.)
          These winds up here are nasty!

INT. BELL-BOEING 609 - DAY

Packed with the seven Aussies and their equipment. As Larsen struggles
to keep the plane steady, Malvern, in the passenger seat, stares down
transfixed at Lake Guaranita.

                    MALVERN
          Somewhere under that water is a
          secret worth billions.

                    LARSEN
          Gonna have to park this birdie down
          below, or we're going for a dip in
          that water right quick.

Malvern finally acknowledges Larsen with a dismissive "Do what you
have to" gesture.

                                        BACK TO:

EXT. NAPO RIVER - DAY

Dodge's trawler chugs to a stop at the mouth of small but steep
rapids. From inside the cabin Dodge yells to Boatmen:

                    DODGE (O.S.)
          Drop anchor and rig the ramp!

EXT. TRAWLER - DAY

Sitting in her now-familiar lotus position under a tattered canopy at
the back of the trawler, Lara works on her laptop, examining the
digitally enhanced image of Darby's map.

CU - LAPTOP: Upon closer inspection of the map we see the words "EL
DORADO" marked by a GOLDEN SUN symbol directly over an unnamed body of
water. One of the sun's rays extends curiously into the lake where a
SECRET DOOR has been drawn.

                    DODGE (O.S.)
          Malvern said he killed for that
          map...

Lara finds Dodge sneaking a peek over her shoulder.

                    DODGE (CONT'D)
          I was expecting something more
          original.

                    LARA
          The man he murdered was a dear
          friend. Don't insult his memory by
          suggesting this map is useless.

                    DODGE
          Apologies to your friend, but Lake
          Guaranita's not hiding anything. You
          and Malvern are both wasting your
          time.

                    LARA
          Maybe Malvern, not me. Since this
          map was made in 1523, magnetic north
          has moved four degrees, give or
          take. That puts this lake on the map
          approximately 90 meters north of
          Lake Guaranita. That's where I'm
          going.

                    DODGE
          Clever. One problem, though: there
          isn't so much as a mud puddle in
          that direction for 200 miles.

                    LARA
               (re: map)
          The lake is gone. A volcanic
          earthquake in 1814 drained the
          entire bas in. Meaning this
          underwater door to El Dorado is
          actually on dry land.

Lara shuts down her laptop, loads it into her backpack.

                    DODGE
               (shakes head, amused)
          I've heard a lot of wild theories.
          That one takes the cake.

Lara will not be daunted.

                    LARA
          Admit it, Dodge. All this talk about
          El Dorado is getting you excited
          again. You're thinking, "Maybe this
          could be the one -- "

                    DODGE
               (interrupts; defensive)
          -- The deal was I'd take you up
          river. That doesn't mean I have to
          watch Malvern and his goons gun you
          down. I do tours, not funerals.

                    LARA
          I've had more fun at funerals.

Lara hefts her backpack and strides for the ramp. Dodge follows her,
starting to feel guilty already.

                    DODGE
          Look...I'd only slow you down. Take
          Luiz and Carlos with you. They know
          the jungle better than me anyway.

                    LARA
               (sarcastic)
          Another twinge of conscience?

                    DODGE
               (in Spanish; to Carlos)
          Go with the lady. First sign of
          trouble, bring her back here.

                    LARA
               (in Spanish; to Carlos)
          Ignore him. Come with me only if
          you'd like to make some real
          money.

Carlos looks at Dodge, then nods to Lara. He and Luiz arm themselves
with MACHETES. They follow Lara down the ramp.

                    DODGE
               (to Lara)
          I'll wait here until I hear
          gunshots, or until you make it back.
          Whichever comes first. Otherwise
          it's about a day's walk back to the
          village.

Lara looks over her shoulder at Dodge for a parting salvo.

                    LARA
          I can't figure if you're more
          worried about my safety...or the
          fact that I just might find El
          Dorado. And put you out of business.

Not willing to answer that question, Dodge watches Lara confidently
set off into the jungle with Carlos and Luiz.

                                        TIME CUT:

EXT. ECUADOR JUNGLE - DAY

The blazing sun above beats down on the rugged, semi-tropical terrain.
Wild birds squawk incessantly throughout the canyon.

PICK UP Lara following along a path cut by the machetes of Carlos and
Luiz. Wiping the sweat from her face, Lara removes her wind-breaker,
stripping down to a tight halter top; a detail that doesn't go
unnoticed by Carlos and Luiz.

Suddenly, the sound of distant UZI FIRE shatters the relative calm of
the jungle. Lara and the Boatmen duck in the brush.

                    LARA
          Wait here.

Lara pulls out her DUAL PISTOLS. FOLLOW Lara as she traverses a narrow
path through the trees, until she comes upon:

EXT. MALVERN'S BASE CAMP - DAY

A cluster of TENTS form a semi-circle around the Bell-Boeing 609
parked in a small clearing. Two of Malvern's men are laughing it up as
they return to the camp with UZIS and a bullet-ridden PECCARY (wild
pig) tied to a rope.

IN THE BRUSH

Lara gestures for Carlos and Luiz to join her; they both look
considerably more nervous than her as she threads the compression
assembly into her pistols and loads them with TRANQ DARTS.

                    LARA
          Not very sporting, hunting with
          uzis. Somebody needs a lesson in
          nature appreciation.

Lara boldly walks into the camp, surprising the Aussies, who drop the
peccary and reach for their guns. But Lara carefully takes two-fisted
aim on both Aussies, then fires her pistols simultaneously --

-- SHTUT! SHTUT! The darts pierce each Aussie's neck, crumpling them
instantly to the ground. FOLLOW Lara as she waves Carlos and Luiz into
the Base Camp.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
               (to Carlos and Luiz)
          Look for juice, chocolate. Anything
          sweet.

Carlos and Luiz have no idea why, but they obey.

AT THE BELL-BOEING

Lara unlatches the engine hatch. She removes the INTERRUPTER CAM and
shoves it into her backpack. Carlos emerges from a nearby tent with a
plastic bottle of HONEY.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          Excellent.

Lara opens the bottle of honey, walks over to the unconscious Aussies
and starts dousing them in the sticky, sweet stuff... Carlos and Luiz
are utterly confounded.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          By the time they wake up, they'll be
          covered in fire ants.
               (smirks)
          Like to see them shoot their way out
          of that one.

Carlos translates for Luiz, and they both smile too, envisioning the
unpleasant outcome.

EXT. ECUADOR JUNGLE - DAY

Further up the trail, Lara follows Carlos and Luiz, both still hacking
away with their machetes. But something catches Lara's eye: clumps of
recently dug earth in a pattern.

Lara gets down on her knees and carefully pushes the dirt aside,
revealing an AP LAND MINE.

                    LARA
          Stop guys! Now!

Carlos stops, looks back. But Luiz keeps walking, chopping away until
...KABOOM!

EXT. LAKE GUARANITA - CONTINUOUS

The Aussies, completing the set-up of an elaborate DIVING OPERATION on
the lake, are alerted by the distant explosion.

                    MALVERN
          One of the mines.

Larsen, applying sunblock, grabs a pair of BINOCULARS.

POV - LARSEN (THROUGH BINOCULARS)

We scan the jungle path near the base camp, settling on the blasted
remains of a PECCARY.

                    LARSEN (O.S.)
          Just a peccary.

                    MALVERN (O.S.)
          A what?

BACK TO SCENE

                    LARSEN
          Bloody pig.

But Malvern does not appear entirely convinced.

                    MALVERN
          Have Base Camp check it out.

EXT. ECUADOR JUNGLE - MOMENTS LATER

Lara watches, waits for the GLINT of Larsen's binoculars in the sun to
disappear before she steps from the underbrush. Lara stands over the
bullet-riddled peccary from Malvern's camp (laid cleverly over the
exploded mine.)

                    LARA
          Let's hope that fooled them.

Lara moves to Luiz's dead body where Carlos is already kneeled beside
his dead friend in prayer.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          You were close with him?

Carlos looks up, holding back his emotions.

                    CARLOS
          My cousin.

Lara kneels down beside Carlos, lays a sympathetic hand on his
shoulder.

                    LARA
          I'm very sorry, Carlos. If you want
          to go back, I understand. But I must
          keep going.

                    CARLOS
               (stands, determined)
          No. I will go with you. For Luiz.

Lara nods and hands him one of her pistols.

                                        DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. LAKE GUARANITA - LATER THAT DAY

Malvern stands atop the lake rim taking out his impatience on a
cigarette. He's staring down at the fully assembled DIVING PLATFORM
floating off the near shore.

Larsen, white sun-block smeared on his nose, is seated nearby on a
fold-out chair reading an issue of "Cosmopolitan." The headline on the
cover: "Show, Don't Tell."

                    LARSEN
               (to Malvern)
          Did you know that 63' of women are
          multi-orgasmic? It's just not fair.

A diver breaks the surface and confers with a second diver on the
platform. The second diver gives Malvern a "thumbs down" signal,
prompting Malvern to angrily snuff out his cigarette butt.

                    MALVERN
          Larsen, what the hell kind of people
          did you hire? The divers are
          incompetent, Base Camp is suddenly
          incommunicado, and you're reading a
          goddamn magazine!

In a flash of his temper, Malvern kicks the magazine from Larsen's
hands. Larsen picks up his walkie-talkie and barks a warning:

                    LARSEN
               (into walkie)
          Listen up you dickheads, don't make
          me come down there.

EXT. MALVERN'S BASE CAMP - DAY

Larsen's droping threats finally revive one of the Aussies from his
tranquilized slumber... It takes him a moment to realize he's covered
from head to toe in FIRE ANTS; he turns his head to see that Aussie #2
is laid out next to him in the same predicament. As the searing bites
register with his central nervous system:

                    AUSSIE #1
          AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!

EXT. LAKE GUARANITA - DAY

Larsen holds the walkie away from his ear as the SCREAMS of both
Aussies nearly burst his eardrum.

                    LARSEN
          What the hell...!?

                    MALVERN
          Peccary my ass.

While Larsen keep barking threats into the walkie, Malvern picks up
the BINOCULARS and starts scanning the surrounding valley, sweeping
from Base Camp northward.

                    MALVERN (CONT'D)
          We've got company.

POV - MALVERN (THROUGH BINOCULARS)

In the adjacent, enclosed basin below, Lara uses a hand-held SCANNING
DEVICE while Carlos watches her back, pistol drawn.

                    MALVERN (CONT'D)
          Two of them. Girl's got what looks
          like a spectrometer...

BACK TO SCENE

Malvern slowly lowers the binoculars, having an epiphany.

                    MALVERN (CONT'D)
          She's looking for volcanic gasses...
          another entrance.
               (to Larsen; urgent)
          Get two men back to Base Camp. The
          other two are coming with me.

EXT. VOLCANIC FISSURE - DAY

Lara's SPECTROMETER registers high levels of sulfuric acid over a
narrow fissure.

                    LARA
          Ah-ha.

                                        CUT TO:

COMPLETE DARKNESS. Then...a rustle. A snap -- whoosh! A burst of
controlled chemical flame. A FLARE casts light on Lara and Carlos, who
proceed cautiously. We are:

INT. VOLCANIC FISSURE - DAY

A few yards into the fissure, the walls become smooth, lined with
tell-tale STONE FORMATIONS.

                    LARA
               (re: stonework.)
          Incan. Early 16th century. Look how
          perfect the seams are...

The gently-sloping path is abruptly closed off with an immense STONE
SLAB. Lara scans the area and notices a WALL LEVER.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          Not much choice, is there?

Carlos shakes his head warily as Lara pulls the lever. Unseen gears
grind, portending trouble. But finally, the slab slides out of the way
...revealing a small ANTECHAMBER.

INT. ANTECHAMBER - DAY

Lara cautiously leads Carlos into the non-descript room. As soon as
Carlos steps on the center tile...

SLAAAAM! The stone slab shuts behind them. Flare in hand, Lara quickly
searches the room. No lever anywhere. But there are NOTCHES carved
into the wall...

                    LARA
          This way!

Lara pulls Carlos back against the wall without notches as: the floor
slides open beneath them...but only halfway!

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          An airlock. Very ingenious.

                    CARLOS
          Air lock?

                    LARA
          Like a submarine. This cavern used
          to be at the bottom of a lake. Had
          to keep the water out.

Lara peers down the vertical shaft below them. With the flare she can
see a few more NOTCHED STEPS in the stone wall...but the rest have
been destroyed by another FISSURE.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          Can't climb down...

Lara drops the flare down the shaft to gauge its depth. About 50 yards
before -- Fssssst. The flare hits a pool of water and extinguishes.

                    CARLOS
          I don't swim.

                    LARA
          No problem. I always come prepared.

Lara hooks a wire from her BELT WINCH to a PITON, then loads the piton
into her compression assembly pistol. Firing the piton into the shaft
ceiling, Lara steps off the antechamber's half-floor and dangles
beside Carlos.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          Let me get down a ways, then grab
          onto the cable yourself.

Carlos nods apprehensively, watching as Lara lowers herself deeper
into the shaft, scanning the walls with her FLASHLIGHT. Swallowing his
fear, Carlos reaches for and grabs hold of the cable...slowly lowering
himself down behind Lara.

Lara's flashlight exposes a series of HIEROGLYPHICS carved onto the
shaft. They appear to be a warning of some kind. Showing BLADES that
will cut in half any tomb raiders who venture down the shaft without
stepping in one particular notch...which Lara realizes she's already
passed.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          Oh dear.

Suddenly, CROSS-CUTTING BLADES slide from the shaft walls in several
places...nearly decapitating Carlos and almost severing Lara's legs!
Their cable cut, they both plummet the last 20 yards into the pool
below, screaming all the way down.

INT. SUBTERRANEAN CAVERN - DAY

Lara and Carlos SPLASH down then quickly break up through the surface
of a small reservoir. Carlos splashes around, no swimmer. But Lara
stands, showing the water only comes to her chest.

                    LARA
          There's a step here.

But as Carlos paddles onto the step, Lara's flashlight reflects off of
dozens of BEADY EYES surrounding them.

                    CARLOS
               (with dread)
          Rats.

                    LARA
          Aim for the eyes.

The chamber is quickly filled with the ECHOES OF GUNFIRE as Lara and
Carlos ascend the underwater steps, shooting rats when they get too
close. The steps lead to:

INT. MAUSOLEUM ROOM - DAY

FOLLOW Lara and Carlos as they enter a stunning, vast subterranean
cavern housing towering GOLDEN STATUES and TWO GOLD-ADORNED MAUSOLEUMS
built squarely in the middle of the chamber, facing one another.

                    CARLOS
          El Dorado?

                    LARA
          Just the tip of the iceberg, if
          we're lucky.

Lara cracks a couple FLARES and tosses them throughout, illuminating
the chamber in an eerie orange glow. Carlos walks with awe towards a
HALF-PUMA/HALF-MAN STATUE with EMERALD EYES -- Lara grabs his hand
before he touches one of the jewels.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          Careful, Carlos. We're intruders
          here. Anything could be a trap.

Lara walks cautiously to the center of the chamber, standing between
the two mausoleum entrances.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          Looks like a royal burial chamber
          for the last Incan king, Manco.

With her flashlight Lara examines the two different STATUES atop each
mausoleum.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          Theses statues represent two of the
          primary gods of the Inca religion.
          Mama Kilya, the mother moon; and
          Ilyapa, the thunder god.

Carlos joins Lara, peering nervously down the ominous stairwell
leading into one of the mausoleums.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          I'd wager that Manco's wife is
          guarded by Kilya, and his firstborn
          son sleeps under Ilyapa.

                    CARLOS
          Where is Manco?

Lara turns her flashlight on an enormous pair of DOUBLE DOORS at the
far back wall. Above the double doors is an immense GOLDEN SUN carved
into the stone.

                    LARA
          That sun represents Inti, the sun
          god. My guess is Manco is buried
          behind those doors.

                    CARLOS
               (hopeful)
          Maybe El Dorado is behind there,
          too.

                    LARA
          Could be. Certainly, no need to
          disturb these other tombs...

Carlos follows Lara back towards the massive double doors. But Lara
stops him with a warning hand.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          Better stay back. I have a feeling
          they haven't rolled out the red
          carpets for us.

Lara tosses Carlos her backpack, then slowly approaches the doors to
Manco's tomb, which appear to be hermetically sealed. Carved into both
doors are KEYHOLES.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          Knife, please.

Carlos pulls a KNIFE from Lara's backpack and flips it to her. Biting
her lip in concentration, Lara tries to jimmy one of the keyholes...
until the floor beneath her feet starts to pivot! Carlos jumps back
in fear.

Maintaining her composure, Lara skids down the now-angled section of
floor...turns and STABS HER KNIFE into the floor, holding on with both
hands as the floor continues to rotate.

POV - LARA

The sub-chamber is filled with SKELETONS impaled on BLOOD INCRUSTED
SPIKES!

BACK TO SCENE

As the floor rotates, Lara dangles inches above the jagged spikes, her
grip on the dagger slipping...one hand falling away...but now the
floor rotates back to its original position and resets itself. Sparing
Lara the fate of many unprepared tomb raiders before her.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          That was fun.

Jaw dropped, Carlos remembers to breathe again.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          Looks like we have to pay a visit to
          mommy and junior after all. See
          about some keys.

INT. TUPAC'S MAUSOLEUM - STAIRS - DAY

Carlos nervously follows Lara down the narrow stairs.

                    LARA
          I've found that traps usually
          reflect how the entombed lived...and
          died. Manco's son, Prince Tupac
          Amaru, was killed by Spanish
          Conquistadors. He was beheaded then
          burned at the stake.

                    CARLOS
               (gulp)
          I'll wait here.

Carlos wisely stops midway down the stairs.

INT. PRINCE'S TOMB - DAY

Stepping down off the final stair, her eyes wide and alert, Lara
enters Tupac's tomb with only a FLASHLIGHT. The rectangular room
appears harmless: an ornately carved SARCOPHAGUS raised on a stone
pedestal. One more step, though, and the stairs behind her suddenly
retract into the wall with a resounding THUD!

Carlos is kneeled at the edge of the stairs where there is now a 15'
drop down into the tomb.

                    CARLOS
          You okay?

                    LARA
          Fine. Just get a rope ready. That
          can't be the worst of it.

As Carlos pulls a ROPE from Lara's backpack, Lara notices that BLACK
LIQUID is oozing up into the room from a sub-area previously blocked
by the stairs. Lara inspects the liquid.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          Oil... Better hurry with that rope,
          Carlos!

Lara hops up onto the stone pedestal to keep away from the rising oil,
which curiously stops flowing once the room is covered with a one foot
layer of the black ooze.

Not sure what to make of this, Lara returns to the task at hand. Using
all her strength, Lara pushes the heavy lid of the sarcophagus...
inside of which she finds A BEJEWELED KEY resting on the Prince's
mummified chest.

But when Lara takes the key...the sarcophagus starts to lower into
the oil!

INSERT SHOT: FLINT STONES on the back of the sarcophagus scrape the
wall and SPARK as it lowers.

THE TOMB BURSTS INTO FLAMES! Lara instinctively leaps for the rope
Carlos has lowered from the edge of the stairs...just catching it with
her fingertips!

Lara scrambles up the rope -- which is burning behind her -- as TWO
STONE SLATS slide closed from both sides of the stairwell. The tomb
is sealing itself up like a kiln...with Lara in it! Carlos grabs hold
of the rope and pulls Lara to safety just the tomb seals itself.
Again, Carlos is emotionally spent.

                    CARLOS
          Don't say that was fun.

                    LARA
          Mildly diverting.
               (teasing Carlos)
          Can't wait to see what mommy's got
          in store for us.

INT. MAUSOLEUM ROOM - DAY

Lara and Carlos exit the Prince's tomb and walk 20' straight across to
the Queen's tomb entrance.

                    CARLOS
          I hate to ask but...how did the
          Queen die?

                    LARA
          You'll want to wait on the stairs.
          Trust me.

INT. QUEEN'S TOMB - DAY

This time Lara descends the stairs more carefully while Carlos watches
on from midway up. With every step, Lara scans the walls, the floor,
the ceiling. When she reaches the bottom of the steps, she half-
expects the stairs to retract again...but they don't.

The Queen's SARCOPHAGUS is set in a RECTANGULAR DEPRESSION in the
floor against the far wall. Lara is now faced with a long walk across
the room, her every step echoing ominously. Sweat starts to bead on
her forehead as Lara searches vainly for a sign of the traps to
come...

Finally, Lara reaches the depression and gently climbs down next to
the sarcophagus. She drops to her knees and inspects every inch of the
coffin: no signs of a trap.

So Lara cautiously tests the lid, which is carved in the shape of a
beautiful woman --

-- SPIKES SHOOT FROM THE HANDS, EYES, AND MOUTH ON THE LID! The lid
itself then springs upright on its lateral hinge, right at Lara...who
jumps backwards against the depression wall just enough so that the
spikes stop millimeters from her torso and face!

Suddenly, loud GRINDING can be heard behind the main tomb's side
walls...which now start closing in above Lara! A quick check of the
distance back to the stairs tells Lara she'll never make it before
being squashed...or sealed into the rectangular depressicn with the
Queen's mummy!

So Lara MULE-KICKS the sarcophagus lid above the hinge...which cracks
and sends the lid smashing back onto its resting place atop the
sarcophagus.

Now Lara runs to the back of the sarcophagus and slides the lid
forward...until it teeters on the front edge of the sarcophagus, then
tilts to the floor. This leaves one end of the lid pointed at the
ceiling (just above the lip of the depression) and the other end of
the lid touching the floor.

In a flash -- with the tomb side walls getting closer each second --
Lara grabs the second KEY from the Queen's mummy, then hops over the
tilted lid, climbs out of the rectangular depression and makes a run
for it across the main tomb floor.

REACTION SHOT: Carlos has his hands over his eyes, watching through
his fingers as:

The walls continue to close in tighter. But moments before Lara is
crushed...the walls stop! Lara looks back, pleased to see: the raised
end of the sarcophagus lid has stopped the walls from closing
further. Her plan worked --

-- CRUUUUUUNCH! The lid BUCKLES and CRACKS under the extreme pressure.
The walls lurch to life again!

Lara starts running...the path back to the stairs getting ever more
narrow...forcing Lara to run side-step now...

CU - THE SARCOPHAGUS LID is about to be pulverized!

Lara senses the end and executes a mid-air TWIST/REVERSE ROUND OFF,
sticking her landing three steps below Carlos just as the walls SLAM
together. Carlos shakes his head.

                    CARLOS
          You are not human.

                    LARA
          I'll take that as a compliment.

Lara leans over to dust herself off, but finds she can't: the walls
have closed on the end of her ponytail.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          Knife, please.

Carlos flips her the knife again. Then he watches Lara cut herself
free, losing an inch or two of hair.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          Needed a trim anyway.

As they start up the stairs, Carlos walking backwards, rambling
nervously to Lara as she ascends with him.

                    CARLOS
          I never seen anything like this. All
          these traps. And still the King's
          tomb to go. How can we ever make it
          to El Dorado?

                    LARA
          As long as we stick together we just
          might get out of here alive.

As they reach the top of the steps leading back to the Mausoleum Room.
Carlos stops, gasps.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          Carlos?

Carlos slumps forward, shot from behind! Lara props up his dead body
for a moment, then ducks as the mausoleum wall ERUPTS under silenced
sniper fire.

Lara grabs back the pistol she lent Carlos and unholsters her own.
After she pulls on her backpack, Lara makes the sign of the cross over
Carlos' body.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          Rest in peace, my friend.

Then she sprints out of the Queen's tomb...

INT. MAUSOLEUM ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Dodging a flurry of BULLETS, Lara runs and shoots her guns, then DIVES
and ROLLS behind the Prince's tomb. TWO AUSSIE SNIPERS continue to
shoot in her direction, Lara puts down her guns and takes the AIRTANK/
FLAMETHROWER from her backpack.

                                        CUT TO:

EXT. ECUADOR JUNGLE - DAY

Luiz's CORPSE laying on its back in the brush.

REVEAL - DODGE staring down at his former Boatman with a sad look of
frustration.

                    DODGE
          Why do they never listen to me?

Dodge hears FOOTFALLS in the jungle. Larsen and two other Aussies
approaching. He takes one last look up towards Lake Guaranita and
mutters:

                    DODGE (CONT'D)
          Good luck, Lara. You're gonna need
          it.

As Dodge starts jogging back towards the Napo river, we go;

                                        BACK TO:

INT. MAUSOLEUM ROOM - DAY

The AUSSIE SNIPERS walk out of the shadows searching for Lara. Their
WALKIE TALKIES squelches to life.

                    MALVERN (O.S.)
               (over walkie)
          I heard shots. Talk to me.

                    AUSSIE #3
          I dropped the monkeyman. Now it's
          the girl's turn.

                    AUSSIE #4
          We'll let you know when it's safe.

The two snipers hear a HISSING noise and see the flickering light of a
controlled flame on one side of the Prince's mausoleum. They approach
the light from opposite sides and leap out of hiding simultaneously
and FIRE --

-- THE AIRTANK EXPLODES INTO FIERY METAL SHARDS! Taking out both
Aussie snipers. A beat. Then Lara drops down from atop the Prince's
mausoleum, landing next to the dead men.

                                        CUT TO:

EXT. VOLCANIC FISSURE - CONTINUOUS

WALKIE-TALKIE in hand, Malvern stands over the fissure, peering down
into the darkness.

                    MALVERN
          What happened!? Cutler! Garrett!

                    LARA (O.S.)
               (over walkie)
          Next time don't send boys to do a
          girl's work.

Off Malvern's incredulous face, we go;

                                        BACK TO:

INT. MANCO'S TOMB - DAY

The massive double doors CREAK open revealing Lara, a look of
anticipation on her face. We are:

INT. GROTTO - DAY

Lara walks into an impossibly beautiful GROTTO with a massive vaulted
ceiling, the centerpiece of which is a shallow REFLECTING POOL
surrounded by a dozen pillars at least two stories high --

-- WHUUUMP! The double doors have slammed shut behind Lara.

On the far side of the grotto Lara finds an ornate entranceway blocked
by solid gold SUN RAYS. But the gaps between rays are not large enough
to crawl through. So Lara pulls out her VIDEO PROBE with REMOTE
CONTROL DEVICE (and mini view screen). Activating the airjet-powered
probe, Lara sends it floating inside the dark burial chamber.

CU - REMOTE MINI-SCREEN: Inscribed on all the walls are PAINTINGS
telling of Manco's great deeds. Depictions of wars won, incredible
amounts of gold amassed. One painting shows Manco holding a BLACK,
VASE-LIKE OBJECT from which gold seems to flow. Another painting finds
Manco praying before the black, vase-like object set atop a glowing
SHRINE.

Lara navigates the probe over to the centerpiece of Manco's burial
chamber: a round, solid gold SARCOPHAGUS. A spiral of HIEROGLYPHICS
particularly interests Lara, who starts feeding the images into her
laptop database. She mentally translates the message on the
sarcophagus...

                    LARA
          You fooled us all, didn't you,
          Manco?

Suddenly, the whole grotto RUMBLES. Lara spins around to see: the
water in the reflecting pool is splashing over the sides! The grotto
is filling up at an astonishing rate.

Lara shoves the probe and laptop into her waterproof backpack. She
runs to the center of the grotto, scanning the walls with her
FLASHLIGHT for a possible escape route. Nothing.

Lara tries to shimmy up one of the columns, but it's too wide. And she
slips back down...into water already neck deep!

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          Could've used that air tank about
          now.

As the water level swiftly rises, carrying Lara closer to the ceiling,
JAGGED SPIKES extend from the ceiling!

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          Got to be a way out...
               (revelation)
          Or a way in.

Seconds from death by impaling, Lara takes a deep breath and dives to
the center of the reflecting pool...

UNDERWATER

Lara searches for and finds a NARROW INLET through which all the water
is flowing into the grotto. Barely able to fit, Lara squeezes inside,
FLASHLIGHT illuminating the way...

NEW ANGLE

Lara is swimming right at us, sloping upwards now. Her eyes wide with
fear as her lungs begin to shrink. Determination turns to desperation
as she abandons the flashlight to stroke with both hands. Faster and
faster...into darkness...

EXT. LAKE GUARANITA - DUSK

Gasping for air, Lara bursts up through the surface of the lake,
recognizable by the missing WEDGE in one side.

Malvern has abandoned the diving platform and pulled up stakes. As
Lara paddles for the shore...

                                        CUT TO:

CU - THE BELL-BOEING ENGINE is missing the interrupter cam (an
integral part of the ignition system) that Lara stole.

                    LARSEN (O.S.)
          Bitch wants to strand us out here.

We are:

EXT. MALVERN'S BASE CAMP - NIGHT

Larsen slams down the engine hatch. Malvern shakes his head, way ahead
of the game.

                    MALVERN
          You don't disable the ignition to
          strand us. You do it because you
          need a way back yourself.

No one else seems to follow Malvern's logic, including Aussies #1 and
#2, their exposed skin peppered with swollen ANT BITES.

                    MALVERN (CONT'D)
          Clear out the camp. Let's see if our
          little rat takes the bait.

EXT. LAKE HILLSIDE - NIGHT

Lara climbs down the moderate incline, stopping beneath a cinchona
tree. She squeezes her hair out and re-braids it into a ponytail, then
pulls out a pair of CUSTOMIZED NIGHT GOGGLES from her backpack.
Scanning the valley below:

POV - LARA (THROUGH GOGGLES)

First point of interest: the Napo river where Dodge dropped her off.
The trawler is no longer moored near the rapids. Scanning further up
river, Lara spots Dodge's vessel half-way back to Francisco de
Orellana.

Lara PANS the goggles to Malvern's base camp, which looks invitingly
deserted. Until Lara flicks on the THERMAL-VIEW FILTER...illuminating
FIVE BODY-HEAT AURAS, lurking in a near-perfect perimeter around the
camp.

BACK TO SCENE

Lara smirks as she removes the goggles.

                    LARA
          Planning a little ambush, are we?

From her backpack, Lara removes a SPREAD PIN. Loading it into her
compression assembly pistol, Lara takes aim on a tree directly across
from her by 50 meters -- a tree with roots planted right near the
Bell-Boeing.

The spread pin shoots silently to the treetop and catches in a branch
"V." Lara ties off the wire end to her cinchona tree. Using a HAND
TROLLEY, Lara starts the long, precarious journey from tree to tree.

NEW ANGLE

Larsen is once again reading Cosmo, this time tallying his point total
on a questionnaire:

                    LARSEN
               (reads analysis)
          "Buy him some Viagra, he needs
          help!?"
               (tosses magazine)
          Stinking rag.

Twenty feet above him, Lara shimmies along stealthily until:

INSERT SHOT: The spread pin pulls through the branch "V."

Lara drops five feet as the wire goes slack, then taut again! The
spread pin re-catches in another "V." Now Lara's dangling by her hands
only, clinging to the hand trolley.

Directly below her, Larsen stands, alerted. Fingers on the uzi
trigger, Larsen looks every direction but up.

Lara gracefully regains her shimmy position and continues on into the
tree unseen.

EXT. MALVERN'S BASE CAMP - NIGHT

Lara descends the tree, placing her ten feet from the Bell-Boeing.
Scampering over to the plane, she quietly raises the engine hatch and
replaces the INTERRUPTER CAM.

INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT

Lara straps herself into her seat and reaches for the ignition. The
keys aren't there.

Thinking quickly, she pulls her night goggles back out and starts
scanning the base camp.

POV - LARA

Inside one of the tents across the camp, Lara ZOOMS IN on a set of
KEYS with a "BB" insignia laying on the MAP TABLE.

                    LARA (O.S.)
          Ah-ha.

BACK TO SCENE

Lara puts away the night goggles and removes the REMOTE PROBE. Picking
through her backpack, she finds what she needs: another spread pin.
Cramming it into the hemispherical ridge on the probe, Lara improvises
a HOOK ATTACHMENT.

EXT. MALVERN'S BASE CAMP - NIGHT

The probe zips across the camp towards the map tent.

                                        INTERCUT WITH:

INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT

Lara watches the MINI VIEW SCREEN as she manipulates the REMOTE
CONTROL DEVICE. She maneuvers the probe to hook up the keys...gets
them on the spread pin...but drops them onto a metal HALIBURTON CASE
-- CHAAAANG!

Malvern and his men all tense up, bring guns to the ready.

                    MALVERN
               (into walkie)
          Where'd that noise come from?

                    AUSSIE #1 (O.S.)
               (over walkie)
          One of the tents.

                    MALVERN
               (into walkie)
          Let's close in. Slowly.

As the Aussies all tighten their perimeter...

Lara bites her lower lip in concentration as she tries to re-hook the
keys. Out of the corner of her eyes she can see the Aussies emerging
one-by-one from the jungle.

One last try and the keys are hooked on the probe. But as Lara steers
the probe back towards the cockpit, a warning light flashes on the
remote control: "COMPRESSION LOW."

Outside, the probe falters, the compressed air-jets not moving it as
fast now...

Malvern spots the probe -- and the keys -- heading towards the Bell-
Boeing. Malvern OPENS FIRE, prompting everyone to unload their clips.

The probe spins around drunkenly, its jet assembly damaged... Lara
leans precariously out of the cockpit, briefly exposing herself to
Aussie gunfire, and reaches for the probe. She grabs the keys just as
the probe falls to the ground!

                    MALVERN (CONT'D)
          STOP HER!

But as they close in -- WHOOOOOSH! Malvern and his men are blasted by
JET WASH from the Bell-Boeing 609. All the Aussies but Malvern open
fire again...

Lara deliberately throws the plane into a 360° ground spin...sending
the Aussies diving for cover...giving her just enough time and space
to ascend vertically from the jungle clearing.

FIND Malvern at a CRATE assembling a SURFACE TO AIR MISSILE!

Larsen spots the probe Lara left behind. Picking it up, he speaks to
the camera lens.

                    LARSEN
          Listen up you wench...

INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT

Lara peers down at the MINI VIEW SCREEN which is on the seat between
her legs. Larsen's ugly mug appears as a static-filled transmission on
the remote display.

                    LARSEN
               (on view screen)
          We've got a little surprise for you.

Larsen points the probe-cam over at Malvern, who fires the missile!
Lara looks out the window of the plane:

POV - LARA

THE MISSILE swerves through the sky right at her!

BACK TO SCENE

Lara quickly searches the control panel, finally locating THE EJECT
LEVER, which she pulls back.

The cockpit canopy BURSTS open and Lara is jettisoned into the night
sky, still strapped into her seat!

EXT. SKY ABOVE - THE ECUADOR JUNGLE - NIGHT

As she tumbles away from the plane, the missile connects with the
Bell-Boeing...which EXPLODES IN MID-AIR!

A PARACHUTE deploys from the top of Lara's seat...and she floats
slowly into the dark jungle below.

EXT. MALVERN'S BASE CAMP - NIGHT

Malvern watches the distant explosion as he tunes in a frequency on
his SHORT-WAVE RADIO.

                    MALVERN
               (into radio)
          Send in my chopper -- you've got our
          coordinates. And bring all the ammo
          we've got left.

EXT. SHIPPING VESSEL - NIGHT

A sleek black HUEY CHOPPER takes off from the deck of a large shipping
vessel outfitted with WHALING EQUIPMENT (harpoon guns, nets, etc.) On
the side of the ship -- and the chopper -- the name "SEAPRO, INC." is
accompanied by a WHITE WHALE LOGO.

                                        DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. FRANCISCO DE ORELLANA - LATER THAT NIGHT

The small town is ablaze. SMOKE clouds the main street where Larsen
and Aussie #3 beat the snot out of a LOCAL while Malvern watches on
with mild interest.

                    LARSEN
          You thought you saw her?! Now what
          the hell good does that do us?

Larsen kicks the Local a few more times for good measure.

                    MALVERN
          Why don't you jog his memory.

Larsen flicks on his GOLD LIGHTER. Aussie #3 holds a MOLOTOV COCKTAIL
under Larsen's lighter, igniting the chemical bomb. Against the
Local's pleas, Aussie #3 hurls the cocktail into the Cantina. FLAMES
erupt.

REVEAL - DODGE watching this inquisition from a safe distance...
wanting to intervene, but powerless to do so. Head down, he crosses
the street into his shanty office.

INT. DODGE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Pulling his leather coat off a wall hook, Dodge stuffs it into an
already packed DUFFEL BAG.

                    LARA (O.S.)
          I found it.

Dodge whirls, BOWIE KNIFE in hand and ready to throw...until he sees
Lara stepping from the shadows! Still beautiful but wearing half the
jungle on her clothes and in her hair.

                    DODGE
               (distressed)
          Are you crazy!? Didn't you see what
          Malvern's doing to this town looking
          for you --
               (realizes)
          You found what?

                    LARA
          El Dorado. But it doesn't mean
          "Golden City" like everyone thinks.
          It means "Golden Man."

                    DODGE
          Look, I don't have time to play word
          games with you. I've got to get out
          of here...

Dodge grabs up his duffel bag. As he exits:

                    DODGE (CONT'D)
          I take it Carlos and Luiz didn't
          make it?

Lara steps in front of Dodge, blocking his path. Their bodies almost
touching.

                    LARA
          No. But they did help me get
          inside Manco's tomb. He's the Golden
          Man, Dodge.

                    DODGE
          So you solved the mystery of El
          Dorado. Bully for you. Doesn't mean
          squat if you're dead.
               (beat)
          I'm leaving. You should too.

                    LARA
          Wait. There's something else...the
          source of all the Incan gold.

This gets Dodge's attention.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          There were directions to another
          sacred place high in the Andes,
          south of here. That's where King
          Manco kept "The Black Veil," which
          either located gold...or created it.

                    DODGE
               (thinks about it but...)
          I told you before, Lara, it's all a
          wild goose chase. Forget it.

He moves away from her, checks out the window: Larsen and company are
working over another couple LOCALS.

                    DODGE (CONT'D)
          They're working their way down the
          street...
               (turns back)
          Do you have any idea who Malvern is?
          I made a few calls, and you can
          forget all that money he's throwing
          around. His whaling business is
          bankrupt. He's a desperate man,
          Lara. He's got nothing to lose.

Lara takes a deep breath to utter uncomfortable words:

                    LARA
          I need you, Dodge. I need your help.

This stops Dodge from exiting the back door.

                    DODGE
          You managed to do in one day what I
          wasn't able to do in ten years. What
          the hell do you need me for?

                    LARA
          I've got Manco's secret, but
          Malvern's got me trapped.
               (beat)
          I don't want my name on that
          impressive list of yours. Just get
          me out of town, and up to the
          mountains, and I'll give you what
          Darby offered me: a 50-50 split.

Mulling it over, Dodge sneaks another peek out the window.

                    DODGE
          What shape was Manco's sarcophagus?

                    LARA
          Round. Like the sun.

Dodge nods, knowing this to be truth. After a long moment:

                    DODGE
          I must be crazy as the rest of you
          ...50-50.

He extends his hand. They shake, holding onto each other for just a
little longer than necessary.

                    DODGE (CONT'D)
          Oh, I almost forgot...

He goes to the curtained-off closet and slides out a small CARGO
CRATE.

                    DODGE (CONT'D)
          This came for you today.

                                        CUT TO:

CU - A CRATE

This 4x4 crate, marked "via messenger", is addressed to Lara Croft
care of Nathaniel Dodge. Lara uses Dodge's BOWIE KNIFE to pry the lid
off of the crate. We are:

INT. TRAWLER CABIN - NIGHT

While Dodge steers the trawler down the Napo without the benefit of
the noisy inboard motor, Lara digs through the excelsior-packed crate,
finding a neatly packaged (in brown paper and string) CHANGE OF
CLOTHES.

                    DODGE
          How convenient.

Lara digs further, finding a small, portable REFRIGERATION BOX (used
for organ transportation.) Inside, cloaked in frosty air, Lara finds
an EGG AND PICKLE SANDWICH and a CARIBBEAN CRUISE BROCHURE with a
note: "Who knows, it might get hijacked. That could be fun. Love,
Karak."

                    DODGE (CONT'D)
          You've got to be kidding me...

Lara bites happily into the sandwich.

                    LARA
          Bite?

                    DODGE
          Egg and pickles? Pass.

Lara puts down the sandwich and picks up the clothes.

                    LARA
          Someplace I can change?

                    DODGE
          Yeah. The master suite.

He jerks a thumb at a curtained area in the rear of the cabin. Lara
pulls back the curtain, revealing a grungy bunk and a rusty sink.

                    LARA
          How charming.

Dodge waits for Lara to disappear behind the closed curtain...then he
grabs up the note.

                    DODGE
          Who's Karak?

                    LARA (O.S.)
          Oh, just the man I live with.

Dodge glances back at the curtain. The single light above the bunk
casts an enticing SILHOUETTE of Lara as she disrobes.

                    DODGE
          Sounds serious.

BEHIND THE CURTAIN

Lara snuggles into a form-fitting Lycra top.

                    LARA
          Quite. Karak's much older. Very
          wise, very distinguished. Frankly,
          I'm lucky to have him.

She's smiling, knowing how this must sound.

BACK IN CABIN

                    DODGE
          I'm surprised he let you come down
          here by yourself. I know I wouldn't.

                    LARA (O.S.)
          And why is that?

                    DODGE
               (after a beat)
          I'd hate to miss all the fun.

Lara emerges from behind the curtain, zipping up her very flattering
new shorts.

                    LARA
          Good answer.

Dodge gives her new outfit a once-over.

                    DODGE
          I feel overdressed.

FLASHLIGHT BEAMS criss-cross over the trawler. Dodge ducks and pulls
Lara down with him.

                    DODGE (CONT'D)
          Must be Malvern.

                    LARA
          Hope you've got a plan B.

                    DODGE
          I prefer to improvise.

                                        CUT TO:

EXT. NAPO RIVER - NIGHT

Malvern and the Aussies stand on top of the sloping Napo banks,
FLASHLIGHTS searching the trawler, which drifts silently in circles.

                    MALVERN
          Search it.

The two Aussies make running leaps from the bank onto the front deck
of the trawler.

                    MALVERN (CONT'D)
          First one to find the girl gets five
          minutes alone with her. Then I want
          every cent she's cost me back in
          blood.

REAR OF THE TRAWLER

Dodge and Lara float in the water, covertly lowering a crudely-carved
CANOE from the back of the boat. He whispers:

                    DODGE
          Turn it over.

Lara is confused for a moment, until she sees: the bottom of the
canoe has been painted to resemble a log.

                    DODGE (CONT'D)
          Fools the banditos eyery time.

Lara smiles, impressed.

BACK ON THE TRAWLER

The two Aussies make a mess of the cabin, finding Lara's crate and
clothes. Aussie #5 steps outside, reports to Malvern:

                    AUSSIE #5
          They're gone, but they were here.

Unconvinced, Malvern shines his flashlight on the river, prompting the
two Aussies to do the same. One of the flashlight beams falls onto the
overturned canoe, which looks remarkably like a floating log.

UNDERNEATH THE CANOE

Lara and Dodge wade through the murky water, along with Dodge's
floating duffel. Their shallow breathing echoes as the flashlight
beams cut through the water all around them.

                    LARA
               (whispers; sarcastic)
          Of course the nice thing about this
          plan is that if they open fire,
          we'll be dead instantly.

                    DODGE
               (whispers back)
          That's if the piranha don't get us
          first.

ON THE BANKS

The two Aussies jump back to the river bank and rejoin Malvern. Aussie
#5 hands the CRATE LID to Malvern, who shines his flashlight on it,
illuminating the name "Lara Croft." Malvern hands the lid back.

                    MALVERN
          I want all the dirt on Ms. Croft.

                                        CUT TO:

EXT. NAPO TRIBUTARY - NIGHT

Lara and Dodge canoe up to Dodge's SEAPLANE, which is hidden in the
vegetation overhanging the edges of the tributary.

INT. SEAPLANE - NIGHT

Dodge and Lara toss their bags into the back of the four-seater. Dodge
fires up the ignition, setting the propellers in fitful motion...until
they stop.

                    LARA
          You need me to get out and push?

                    DODGE
               (pointed)
          I think best when it's quiet.

He drops his head between Lara's legs, nosing around under the dash.

                    LARA
          Bit forward, aren't we?

Fiddling with wires, Dodge sets the props back into action.

                    DODGE
          Hey, it's our second date, right?

                    LARA
          Date's over. I see flashlights.

Sure enough, oncoming FLASHLIGHT BEAMS streak through the trees. Dodge
ignores them, concentrating instead on taxiing the seaplane back onto
the Napo.

As the flashlights draw closer and brighter, Dodge points the seaplane
up river where the vegetation is less dense. UZI GUNFIRE lights up the
night sky as Dodge throttles the seaplane down the watery runway...

                    DODGE
               (to plane)
          Come on, honey. Come on.

As the plane finds some lift, Lara is the first to spot their next
obstacle.

                    LARA
          Naturally you accounted for this.

                    DODGE
          Naturally.

POV - BOTH LARA & DODGE

The trawler still floats in circles upstream, completely blocking
their river runway!

BACK TO SCENE

Amidst gunfire, as a collision appears imminent, Dodge ROLLS THE PLANE
SIDEWAYS...just missing the trawler and several shoreline trees. Lara
opens her eyes and resumes breathing.

                    LARA
               (slightly shaken)
          That brought back memories.

EXT. NAPO RIVER - NIGHT

With uzi fire still blazing around him, Malvern watches the seaplane
lights recede into the night sky. He gestures to Larsen and company to
suppress their fire -- oddly, all the Aussies have been firing their
uzis into the jungle.

                    MALVERN
               (grins)
          Worked like a charm.

He activates a REMOTE TRACKING DEVICE which shows a small OSCILLOSCOPE
radar display of the seaplane's location.

                                        CUT TO:

EXT. SEA-PLANE - NIGHT

On the underside of the seaplane, a RED LIGHT blinks on a small BLACK
BOX LOCATOR DEVICE.

INT. SEAPLANE - NIGHT

Oblivious to the tracking device, Lara types on her laptop.

                    DODGE
          The suspense is killing me. Where're
          we headed?

CU - LARA'S COMPUTER displays video footage taken inside Manco's tomb.
Lara FREEZE FRAMES on the carvings atop the sarcophagus.

                    LARA (O.S.)
          These hieroglyphics imply the Black
          Veil is hidden in Machu Picchu.

                    DODGE (O.S.)
          Not a chance. That place has been
          picked clean.

Dodge leans over for a look at the laptop imagery.

                    DODGE (CONT'D)
          Look at that sarcophagus. That's my
          old trust fund. With interest.

Lara feels the seaplane start to drift and tilt.

                    LARA
          Watch the drool. Eyes on the sky.

Lara isolates a section of hieroglyphics and instructs the computer to
"translate." As the new text begins to scroll:

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          We're looking for a city the Incas
          called "Bed of Gold." That's where
          we'll find the Veil shrine.

Dodge shoots Lara an astonished look.

                    DODGE
          Not bed, cradle. Choquaquirao. Means
          "cradle of gold." 50 miles from
          Machu Picchu. No more than 20 people
          have ever made it up there.

                    LARA
          Wanna make it 22?

Off Dodge's consenting smile, we;

                                        DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. APURIMAC RIVER, PERU - DAWN

As the sun rises above the semi-tropical flatlands, Dodge's seaplane
appears over the trees, banking over the Apurimac gorge. The aircraft
glides down into the narrow chasm, skipping along the fast-moving
waters before docking at the lone beachhead on one of the river banks.

INT. COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

Dodge looks at Lara, who is taking a peaceful catnap in the passenger
seat. Cutting the engine, Dodge stares at her for a moment, finally
glimpsing the young girl beneath the tough exterior. Lara senses him
staring and blinks awake.

                    LARA
               (groggy smile)
          I was just dreaming that we found
          what we're looking for.

                    DODGE
          From your lips to God's ears.

                                        CUT TO:

EXT. NEVADO PANTA - DAY

PAN from the majestic mountaintop of Nevado Panta, obscured in mist,
down a near 90° sheer face encumbered by thousands of jagged crags.
STOP on Dodge's slack-jawed face.

                    DODGE
          I guess this is a bad time to
          mention my fear of heights.

Dodge turns at the sound of TINK-TINK-TINK: it's Lara pounding a piton
into the mountain face.

                    LARA
          The real problem's going to be this
          metamorphic rock.

She tests the piton, which loosens as the rock crumples.

                    DODGE
          You don't understand. I can't do
          this, Lara.

Lara removes some ROPE & CARABINERS from her backpack.

                    LARA
          Of course you can. I used to be
          terrified of elevators. My father's
          trick was keeping my mind off the
          moment.

Dodge pulls a half-empty BOTTLE OF SCOTH from his duffel.

                    DODGE
          Your father was a smart man.

As Dodge takes a swig, Lara fires a spread pin high up onto the
mountain face.

                    LARA
          We'll talk about anything. Except
          what we're doing. Just look up and
          stay positive.

Lara fastens the rope from above to her belt winch.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          I'll take lead and secure your guide
          line. All you have to do is hold on.

                    DODGE
          I thought we weren't gonna talk
          about this?

                                        CUT TO:

FURTHER UP THE MOUNTAIN

Dodge careens into the frame, the gusting winds swinging him at the
end of his rope like a pendulum.

                    DODGE (CONT'D)
          AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!

The winds die down for a moment, allowing Dodge to regain a grip on
the rock face. Lara calls down to him:

                    LARA (O.S.)
          Favorite movie!?

                    DODGE
          Anything with Buster Keaton!

Up above him, Lara is in her element. Eagle eyes unblinking as she
carefully searches each crag for the perfect grab or toe hold.

                    LARA
          Want to know mine!?

The wind pushes Dodge drifting again.

                    DODGE
          Not really!

                    LARA
          "Vertigo!"

Lara lowers down to Dodge's side.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          Only teasing.

This offers no comfort to Dodge, who looks seasick. Lara fastens his
carabiner to a new guide line.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          Relax. I can almost see the top.

The winds bump their bodies together, causing friction.

                    DODGE
          Do you know what the worst part is?
          How much you're enjoying this.

                    LARA
          I've tried it scared. Not as much
          fun.

As Lara ascends, Dodge is buffeted again by the winds, this time
spinning him around several times.

INSERT SHOT: Dodge's anchor pin starts to pull from the stone.

Lara traverses a difficult outcropping by moving hand-over-hand until
she finds purchase for her foot. Just as she reaches the edge of a
large, overgrown plateau with RUINS...

INSERT SHOT: Dodge's anchor pin pulls from the stone.

Dodge yells as he FREE FALLS down the mountain face!

Lara sees what's coming and tries to brace herself -- PRIIIING!
Dodge's guide line goes taut and starts to pull Lara down with him.
Sliding back over the edge, Lara somehow manages to brace herself --
legs spread wide -- catching a rock with each foot.

Dodge jerks to a stop! His guide line belt SNAPPING A BUCKLE and
busting open...leaving Dodge dangling by his hands! He now makes the
mistake of looking down at the dizzying height.

                    LARA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          HANG ON, DODGE!

Lara frantically re-secures Dodge's guide line around an upper rock.
Once done, Lara flips her carabiner onto Dodge's guide wire and begins
rappelling down the mountain face.

Covering 20 yards between each touch, Lara almost appears to be
flying. Glancing down, she sees Dodge swinging wildly in the wind.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          Here I come!

Timing her last rappel perfectly, Lara propels herself laterally as
well...swinginq at Dodge just as his own swing reaches its climax.
Like an acrobat, Lara scoops up Dodge in one arm -- he releases the
belt and grabs onto her tightly.

Together they swing, spinning in the wind like dancers on a cloud...
across the mountain face until Lara catches a crag with her feet and
brings their thrill ride to an end.

Their resulting embrace couldn't be any more intimate. Their faces no
closer together. This shared near-death moment has left both of them
breathless with a nearly post-coital bliss.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          So was that good for you?

                    DODGE
          Not good enough to try it again.

                    LARA
               (smirks)
          Maybe on the way back down.

                                        CUT TO:

EXT. APURIMAC RIVER - DAY

Malvern's BLACK HUEY HELICOPTER sets down next to Dodge's seaplane on
the beachhead. Malvern is the first one out this time, an increasing
desperation noticeable in his actions.

Malvern rummages around inside the plane cabin but finds nothing of
interest. Using the binoculars around his neck, Malvern starts
scanning the mountainous countryside...

POV - MALVERN (THROUGH BINOCULARS)

We PAN past a ROPE dangling down the Nevado Panta. WHIP PAN back...
then up, up, up.

Just in time to see Lara and Dodge, barely visible through the mist,
cresting the plateau ridge onto Choquequirao.

BACK TO SCENE

Malvern lowers the binoculars and strides back to the Huey.

                    MALVERN
          Let's go.

                    LARSEN
          Where?

                    MALVERN
               (points)
          All the way to the top.

Larsen's gaze follows Malvern's finger all the way up to the mountain
in the mist.

                    LARSEN
          Holy shit.

                                        CUT TO:

EXT. CHOQUEQUIRAO - AFTERNOON

At 6,000 feet the view from this majestic promontory is breathtaking.
Lara stands at the very edge of the plateau staring down the cliff,
awash in distant memories.

                    DODGE (O.S.)
          So where's this famous shrine?

Slowly, Lara turns to find Dodge rooting around some overgrown RUINS
nestled just below the highest Nevado Panta peak.

                    DODGE (CONT'D)
          'Cause this sure as hell ain't it.

                    LARA
          If I understand the computer
          translation correctly, it's directly
          beneath us. We're supposed to use
          the "Stairway from the Stars."

                    DODGE
          You can't mean those.

Dodge points to a 15 foot high flight of GIANT, CRUMBLING STAIRS...
which lead to nothing.

                    DODGE (CONT'D)
          It's below us but the stairs go up?
          Must be some Incan practical joke.

With a clarity of vision, Lara walks towards the stairs.

                    LARA
          It's not a joke. It's a secret. You
          don't see the combination to Fort
          Knox posted on the net, do you?

                    DODGE
          I'm sorry, but I thought you had all
          this figured out. I thought that's
          why I just went ten rounds with
          death back there.

                    LARA
               (echoes his line)
          I prefer to improvise.

                    DODGE
          Cute. Real cute.

Lara drops to her knees, inspects the area where the stone stairs meet
the floor slab. Dodge joins her, still skeptical.

                    LARA
          This stairwell appears to move, so
          all we need to find is the trigger.

Dodge looks around at the vast ruins.

                    DODGE
          Sure. No problem.

                    LARA
               (ignores him)
          What is the preeminent symbol in
          Incan culture?

                    DODGE
          That would be the sun.

                    LARA
          Very good, Nathaniel. And can you
          tell me what the most important date
          on the Incan calendar is?

Dodge rolls his eyes but answers:

                    DODGE
          Inti Rami, the summer solstice.
          Unfortunately, that's eight months
          from now.

Lara keeps circling the stairs, her passion and concentration growing
with each step, as her mind hones in on the solution.

                    LARA
          The translation said: "On Inti Rami,
          the last rays of the sun will walk a
          stairway from the stars.
               (beat)
          I'll wager you my 50% in gold that
          the trigger appears at sunset.

                    DODGE
          That gives us less than an hour to
          figure out how to replicate the Rami
          sun.

Lara removes her MIRROR SHADES from her backpack.

                    LARA
          Easy. All I need are your shades.

                                        CUT TO:

CU - A GLINT OF SUN

Which is captured in one of Lara's mirrored lenses.

                    LARA (O.S.)
               (CONT'D)
          According to my calculations...

EXT. CHOQUEQUIRAO - DUSK

FIND Lara seated atop a section of ruins with her LAPTOP in hand,
working on an sophisticated ASTRONOMICAL PROGRAM.

                    LARA
          ...we need to compensate for a
          declination of the sun by
          approximately 13%.

                    DODGE
               (sarcastic)
          I was thinking the exact same thing.

Dodge plays with the handful of FOUR MIRRORED LENSES removed from
their shades, watching them sparkle in the sun.

                    LARA
          That means the first one needs to be
          about three more feet to your right.

Dodge plants the first "mirror" in a crevasse facing the sun:

                    DODGE
          So I'm curious, Lara, why're you
          doing this? What're you looking for?

                    LARA
          I told you. I promised Darby I'd see
          this through.
               (beat; re: mirrors)
          The second one gets reversed about
          ten feet that way.

                    DODGE
          It's an honorable reason. But it's
          also bullshit.

                    LARA
          Excuse me?

                    DODGE
          This isn't about some map. Or a
          friend. Or even the Black Veil. This
          is your life. I can see it in your
          eyes, everything I used to be.
          You're a professional -- beyond a
          professional. You're prepared for
          everything --

                    LARA
               (interrupts)
          -- you can never be prepared for
          everything.
               (beat; re: mirrors)
          Third one goes atop that fountain.

                    DODGE
          So why do you do it? I get the sense
          you don't need the money. Hell, I
          get the sense you don't need
          anything. Or anyone. Well, besides
          this Karak guy.

                    LARA
          I needed you, didn't I?

                    DODGE
          Yeah, but it really killed you to
          say so, didn't it?

Lara can't meet his gaze, so she returns to her laptop.

                    LARA
          Okay, we don't have much time left.
          The fourth mirror goes --

                    DODGE
               (interrupts)
          -- Forget all this crap for a
          minute!

Dodge moves closer to Lara, determined to crack her shell.

                    DODGE (CONT'D)
          Look, I agreed to get you up here,
          and I've done that. If I quit now,
          I've already earned my 50%. If I go
          underground with you looking for the
          Black Veil, how does that change our
          deal?

                    LARA
          If it's about the money, Dodge, you
          can have the entire lot. 100%.

Dodge crouches in front of her. Eyes fixed on hers.

                    DODGE
          I'm not talking about money, Lara. I
          want to know what happens with us?

For the first time Lara's trademark poise is gone. A beat.

                    LARA
               (hesitates)
          I guess this is one of those
          situations I'm not prepared for.

Finally, Dodge rises with a resigned sigh.

                    DODGE
          You know what...? Neither am I.
               (long pause)
          So what about this fourth mirror?

Relieved to be back to business, Lara doesn't miss a beat.

                    LARA
          Reverse it, and ten feet to the
          left.

As Dodge places the final mirror:

                    DODGE
          How do we know it's working anyway?

                    LARA
          We'll know. In less than a minute.

Lara and Dodge watch the sun slowly sinking beneath the horizon. As
the last rays of sunshine glint off the first lens it bounces the
light back to the second lens...then reflects it back to the third
lens...and finally the fourth.

AT THE STAIRS

The beam of sunlight appears to "walk" down the stairs as the sun sets
deeper into the horizon. When it reaches the bottom step...nothing
happens.

                    DODGE
          Obviously I'm missing something.

                    LARA
          Obviously.

Lara has circled around the back of the steps where she points out
that the beam of sunlight has pierced a SMALL IMPERFECTION in one of
the stair's stone seams...sending a thin beam of light all the way
across the ruins to an ORNAMENTU STONE protruding from the partial
remains of a TEMPLE. And then the beam disappears. The sun has set.

                    DODGE
               (inspects imperfection)
          That crack? That's the big secret?

                    LARA
          Haven't you ever noticed there are
          no imperfections in Incan masonry?

Lara starts jogging over to the collapsed temple, while Dodge stays at
the stairs, taking a seat.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          That crack is there by design.

Lara reaches the ornamental stone, and as Dodge watches from the
stairs, Lara gives the stone a once-over, then pushes it with both
hands...

THE STAIRS RUMBLE TO LIFE BENEATH DODGE! He jumps from his perch as:
a PASSAGE opens at the base of the stairs and the entire stairwell
corkscrews down into the ground.

Dodge looks incredulously across the ruins at Lara.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          Lucky you didn't take my wager.

INT. CHOQUEQUIRAO - FOYER - NIGHT

They descend the Stairway from the Stars, which empties into a
beautiful, dome-shaped FOYER encircled with 12 GOLD PLAQUES
representing the gods associated with each month of the year. Not a
trap in sight.

                    DODGE
          Amazing.

Leading the way with a FLASHLIGHT, Dodge excitedly steps down into the
foyer, but Lara grabs him firmly by the arm:

                    LARA
          Not so fast.

Where Dodge's next step would have been, Lara fires her gun at an
invisible PRESSURE PAD to trigger a maniacal flurry of action: BLADES
shoot from each gold plaque, criss-crossing the room and disappearing
back into a different plaque.

                    DODGE
          Thank God I didn't find this place
          ten years ago. I wpuld've been
          filletted right out of the gate.

                    LARA
               (serious)
          And you still might. Somewhere down
          here is the Inca's most sacred and
          well-guarded shrine. You want to
          come with me, I've got to know you
          aren't going to get us killed.

                    DODGE
               (interrupts; insulted)
          -- Hey, I'm not that rusty. You just
          worry about yourself.

                    LARA
          Works for me.

Lara moves past Dodge, wielding her own FLASHLIGHT as she leads them
both across the foyer to a long, dark and narrow STONE PASSAGEWAY with
a DOORWAY at the other end.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          See these floor tiles? A favorite
          Incan trick.

                    DODGE
          Floor collapses. I've seen that.

Lara fires bullets at several floor tiles. Nothing happens.

                    LARA
          No, the Incans were smarter than
          that. The first set of traps is a
          misdirect. Designed to make you
          think every trap can be pre-
          sprung.
               (hands Dodge flashlight)
          Hold this. Keep it ahead of me.

INT. CHOQUEQUIRAO - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Lara walks slowly out onto floor tiles, eyes scanning the dark but
harmless-seeming periphery.

                    LARA
          The unsuspecting tomb raider walks
          confidently onto the tiles never
          even seeing what hit him...

She gestures for Dodge to shine the flashlight at the ceiling:

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          ...because he forgot to look up --

--SLUURSH! A MASSIVE BLADE drops down like a guillotine from the
ceiling...forcing Lara to somersault forward, nearly cleaved. But the
hits just keep coming --

-- SWUUUSH! SWUUUSH! TWO CIRCULAR BLADES scissor simultaneously from
the walls nearly beheading Lara, who dives to the ground and rolls to
safety just as --

-- CRUNCH! CRUNCH! CRUNCH! BOULDERS drop like deadly hailstones all
around Lara, collapsing the floor tiles and revealing SPIKE BEDS
beneath them. Lara sprints across the rapidly checkerboarding floor to
the DOOR at the end of the room...but the door is only a painting!
Lara reacts as --

-- THWIT-THWIT-THWIT-THWIT! DARTS shoot from the faux door, prompting
Lara to instinctively SIDE-FLIP to safety...but only for a moment
because --

-- CRAAAACK! THE FLOOR TILES give way beneath her, just as Lara spots
an ELEVATED PASSAGEWAY. She leaps for and barely catches the lip of
the passage. While Lara hangs there:

Dodge watches in awe as: THE ENTIRE ROOM RESTORES ITSELF in five
incredible seconds! Floor tiles hinge back into place, blades
disappear back into walls, etc. Not even any boulders.

With a tremendous show of strength, Lara now pulls herself up into a
HANCSTAND on the lip, then gracefully executes a WALKOVER into the
passageway. Breathing hard, but utterly composed, she turns back and
gestures to Dodge.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          Your turn.

INT. CHOQUEQUIRAO - ELEVATED PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

Lara walks slowly through the flat passage, FLASHLIGHT in hand. Behind
her we can hear Dodge's EXCLAMATIONS as he makes his way though the
last set of traps. Finally, Dodge catches up with Lara, picking a DART
from his shoulder.

                    DODGE
          Okay, so maybe I am a little rusty.

Where Dodge is masking his nerves with glibness, Lara's focus only
grows more intense as she moves closer to her prize.

                    LARA
          You're still alive. That's all that
          matters --
               (gestures)
          -- Stop! Don't move.

Lara can just barely make out the end of the elevated passageway
before them: A SMALL PIT.

                    DODGE
          What is it now?

                    LARA
          That pit ahead. Not a good sign.

She turns back, flashlight illuminating the entrance through which
they entered; they are at about the midway point of the passageway.
Removing a BULLET from her gun, Lara drops the ammo on the floor...
where it starts rolling towards the pit. Rolling and rolling,
indicating an incline which is not at all evident inside the
passageway.

                    DODGE
          How's that possible?

WE HEAR the bullet still rolling away in the dark.

                    LARA
          The walls. They're an optical
          illusion. Makes us feel like we're
          on level ground so we don't expect
          the massive boulder that's going to
          crush us.

                    DODGE
               (suddenly worried)
          And what exactly triggers that?

Before Lara can answer the bullet stops rolling, sounding off with an
ominous PING!

                    LARA
          Oh dear.

THE PASSAGEWAY RUMBLES as a MASSIVE BOULDER drops down from the
ceiling about 20 yards behind them. As Lara and Dodge sprint towards
the pit --

-- TWO HANGING BLADES PENDULUM DOWN IN THEIR PATH swinging out of sync
and making passage through them impossible. While Dodge looks back in
mounting fear at the oncoming boulder, Lara studies the swinging
blades.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          You take the near, I'll take the
          far!

                    DODGE
          What!?

Lara LEAPS at the far blade...grabbing hold of the WOODEN STEM from
which it pendulums! Clinging safely above the blade she climbs as
close to the ceiling as humanly possible.

                    LARA
          Better get the rust out, Dodge!

Dodge takes one quick look back at the onrolling boulder (which fills
about 3/4 of the passageway) before he leaps! Clinging onto the near
blade's wooden stem just like Lara --

-- SAAAAAAAAAAASH!!! The boulder plows through both blades, snapping
them off at the wooden stems inches below Lara and Dodge's feet. They
both drop safely down to the passageway as the boulder continues
rolling into the pit.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          Having fun yet?

                    DODGE
               (surprises himself)
          Yeah. As a matter of fact I am.

INT. CHOQUEQUIRAO - WATER TEMPLE - NIGHT

They climb from the pit up to ledge overlooking a rectangular temple
filled with water. The only visible way across the temple -- to the
GOLDEN DOORWAY on the other side -- is via 10 VERTICAL PILLARS spaced
dauntingly apart. Lara's FLASHLIGHT reveals the WATER IS ROILING with
unseen menace.

                    DODGE
          Looks inviting.

Lara cracks a FLARE open and drops it into the water --

-- A GIANT BARRACUDA surfaces to swallow the flare whole!

                    DODGE (CONT'D)
          Barracuda.

                    LARA
          Very hungry barracuda.
               (beat)
          No margin for error here.

Lara takes a few steps back, runs and LEAPS to the first pillar,
pulling herself up on top...

A TALL FLAME ignites from the top center of the pillar! (The other
pillars ignite as well creating an eerie, deadly spectacle.)
Instinctively, Lara BACKFLIPS...executing a HALF TWIST in midair as
she lunges back for the ledge --

-- Dodge grabs Lara by the arm as she comes up short! Dangling over
the edge by one hand -- feet skimming the water -- Lara notices two
problems immediately: 1) Her shorts are ON FIRE!, and; 2) A BARRACUDA
jumps from the water for one of her legs, which she daintily bends at
the knee to avoid dismemberment.

Lara quickly scales the wall with Dodge's help, who gallantly pats out
the flames on her shorts.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          Lucky for me you were here.

                    DODGE
          Just trving to earn my 50%.

Lara and Dodge both turn and survey the situation.

                    DODGE (CONT'D)
          Hard to improvise the impossible.

                    LARA
          Nothing's impossible. Theoretically.

Dodge watches Lara pace back and forth on the ledge, her mind
attacking the problem at hand.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          If I wasn't out of winch cable we
          could easily traverse this room.

                    DODGE
          Maybe if we can figure a way to put
          the fires out...

                    LARA
          Yes, but those jumps can only be
          made with a running start. After the
          first pillar you're stuck --

-- Lara snaps her fingers with an idea.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          Got it!

She shines her flashlight on the base of the first pillar.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          See the erosion at the water line?
          Same thing on all the pillars.

                    DODGE
               (follows her)
          You can't be thinking...

                    LARA
          -- It's the only way. But it'll
          require our combined body weight.

Lara offers Dodge her hand.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          You still with me, Dodge?

                    DODGE
          For better or worse.

Dodge takes her hand in hers. Together they step to the back of the
ledge. Exchange a last glance at one another...then run and TANDEM
JUMP for the first pillar!

They both hit and grab onto the edge of the pillar simultaneouslv.

Their weight has caused the pillar to sway back and forth...back and
forth...until --

CRAAAAAAACK! The pillar breaks at the base...sending the pillar
falling forward as Lara and Dodge scramble to stay astride it --

-- CRAAAAAACK! The first pillar strikes the second pillar, breaking it
at the base...sending it falling forward into the third pillar. And so
on, and so on. Like dominoes all the way to the golden doorway -- a
path of pillars has been laid out for them across the dangerous
waters, with all the flames extinguished.

                    LARA
          You know, I think we make a pretty
          decent team.

INT. SUBTERRANEAN CAVERN - CONTINUOUS

Entering through the golden archway, Lara and Dodge discover a
stunning SHRINE built in the middle of a massive subterranean cavern,
partially collapsed from years of earthquakes.

                    DODGE
          I don't know about you, but my heart
          is pounding -- I feel like a kid
          again.

                    LARA
          I know exactly how you feel.

Lara starts CRACKING FLARES, tossing them around the cavern where
ROCKS and DEBRIS litter the periphery.

INSIDE SHRINE

As they both climb the steps leading up to the center of the shrine,
Lara notices one of the outer shrine columns is literally BENT under
the weight of collapsed ceiling.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          Only one stone bends like this...

Dodge is thinking exactly the same thing as he polishes the grimy
column with his shirt sleeve.

                    DODGE
          Gold.

With her flashlight, Lara points out how their boots have left subtle
IMPRESSIONS in the shrine floor. Dropping down to his knees, Dodge
furiously scrubs away the dirt.

                    DODGE (CONT'D)
          It's all gold...
               (looks around shrine)
          The floors. The walls. The ceilings.

He stands, awe-struck by his incomparable surroundings.

                    DODGE (CONT'D)
          Maybe it's not El Dorado but this...
          this is what I always imagined
          finding. Something beyond
          description...beyond belief.

                    LARA
          I have a feeling it gets better...

Lara moves into the center of the shrine to a GOLDEN STATUE OF INTI
(the sun god) holding a crude-cut obsidian BOWL atop an ornate
pedestal. (This is the same object depicted in Manco's burial
chamber.)

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          Here it is. The Black Veil.

                    DODGE
          Not much to look at. What does it
          do?

                    LARA
          Every culture has legends about a
          magical device which turns ordinary
          metals into gold -- The Crow's Head,
          The Philosopher's Stone. But the
          stories are usually cautionary tales
          about the evils of greed.

                    DODGE
          Time to throw caution to the wind.

With sparkling eyes, Dodge gratifies his long-dormant Prospector's
fever. He pulls off a cheap SILVER RING and drops it into the Black
Veil.

                    LARA
          Legends say to make it work, you
          must clasp the bowl with both hands
          and visualize the desired
          transformation -- the Veil's magic
          is powered by the soul of the user.

Dodge clasps the bowl as instructed, staring down intently at the
silver ring. When nothing happens after 20 seconds, Dodge
embarrassedly hands the bowl to Lara.

                    DODGE
          You try it. I still owe the IRS back
          taxes so technically my soul's in
          hock.

Clasping the bowl, Lara stares at the ring and the magic begins
instantly: the ring melts to liquid...boiling furiously as a mystical
BLACK SMOKE froths over the cup, veiling the transmutation-process.

REACTION SHOTS: Both Lara and Dodge watch on in wonder as...

The smoke magically dissipates and LIQUID GOLD remains where there
once was silver! As Dodge pours it out:

                    DODGE (CONT'D)
          I don't believe my friggin' eyes.

A jubilant grin consuming his face, Dodge raises his fists in triumph
and shouts to the heavens:

                    DODGE (CONT'D)
          YEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!

Ecstatic, Dodge grabs a surprised Lara in a bear hug, spinning her
around like they just won the lottery.

                    DODGE (CONT'D)
          We're rich, Lara! We're filthy rich!

As Dodge's euphoria dies down they stop spinning. Now Dodge and Lara
find their faces mere inches apart. A beat.

                    DODGE (CONT'D)
          I forgot. You're already rich.

                    LARA
               (sincere)
          It's all yours, Dodge. Truly. You
          deserve this.

Lara's statement inexplicably chills Dodge, who pulls back.

                    DODGE
          That's sweet. But let's get out of
          here.

                    LARA
               (bemused)
          I don't understand. What's the rush?

                    MALVERN (O.S.)
          My sentiments exactly...

REVEAL - MALVERN and his men (Larsen plus four) surrounding the shrine
from all sides. When Lara rapidly draws her pistols the Aussies all
pump their 12 gauges. A standoff.

                    MALVERN (CONT'D)
          We've got so much catching up to do.

Malvern moves up the steps towards Lara, fully intrigued by this
unconventional woman of beauty, brains and balls.

                    MALVERN (CONT'D)
          First of all, Ms. Croft, much thanks
          for working out those nasty traps.
          We couldn't have made it without
          you.
               (beat; cheap shot)
          Can't say the same thing about
          Daddy.

Lara's eyes narrow with spite at the mention of her father. Dodge
picks up on Lara's emotions but doesn't understand.

                    MALVERN (CONT'D)
          Some people, like me, earn their
          fortunes with sweat and blood. Ms.
          Croft here took a little shortcut.
          Left her Daddy to die in the
          Himalayas. Inherited forty million
          dollars at the age of 16. Gives most
          of it away to charity these days to
          appease her guilty conscience --

-- Lara snaps! She runs for Malvern...but Larsen brutally
CLOTHESLINES her with his shotgun! Catching Lara under the chin and
sending her legs out from under her.

                    LARSEN
               (smiles)
          Must've hit a hot spot.

Dodge kneels beside Lara to help her up.

                    DODGE
          Alright Malvern. You've had your
          laughs. Now leave her alone.

                    MALVERN
          I've got much bigger scores to
          settle than some British bimbo who
          thinks she's bloody James Bond.
               (beat; to Larsen)
          Get the Veil. As Larsen grabs the
          Veil from the statue, Lara gets back
          on her feet with Dodge's help.

                    LARA
          Flooding the world's gold market
          isn't going to solve anything.

                    MALVERN
               (chuckles)
          Just like a lousy Brit to think so
          small.

Larsen delivers the Black Veil to Malvern.

                    MALVERN (CONT'D)
          I didn't hire Erikson to find me
          gold. That's the least of my
          interests.

                    DODGE
          You got what you want, Malvern. Why
          don't you get out of here.

                    MALVERN
          No. I think I'd rather watch you
          kill the little bitch first.

                    DODGE
          Bullshit. That wasn't part of the
          deal.

                    LARA
               (realizes)
          You sold me out. You led them here.

Dodge, feeling the pressure now, tries to explain to Lara.

                    DODGE
          They were going to kill you back in
          the village if you didn't tell them
          what you found in Manco's tomb. I
          knew you wouldn't talk...

                    LARA
          ...unless I thought I could trust
          you.

                    DODGE
          I just didn't want to see you get
          hurt.

                    LARA
          And I thought chivalry was dead.

Unexpectedly, Lara ROUNDHOUSE PUNCHES Dodge with such force he drops
to one knee.

                    LARSEN
               (mocks Dodge)
          Oooh, that's gotta hurt.

                    LARA
          You want me dead, Malvern? Do it
          yourself.

Malvern smiles at the challenge, considering the notion.

                    DODGE
          No! I'll do it...
               (rises; wipes blood from
               his lip)
          Only if you let me live.

Lara stares at him incredulously. Malvern crosses his arms.

                    MALVERN
          Impress me. Do it with your hands.

Dodge nods to Malvern, then turns to face Lara. She glares at him
defiantly as he steps right up to her. Hands at his side, Dodge mouths
a single word to Lara: "Run." As Lara's surprised eyes acknowledge the
improvised plan...

Dodge draws his BOWIE KNIFE from the sheath on his belt and in one
fluid motion, does a half turn and FLINGS THE BLADE right at Malvern's
heart! But Malvern's reflexes are fast enough to flinch, impaling the
blade in his shoulder instead!

BA-BOOOM! Larsen plugs Dodge with a shotgun blast. But Lara is already
on the flee --

-- BA-BOOOM! BA-BOOOM! BA-BOOOM! The Aussies unload their 12 gauges
into the shadowy periphery as Lara dodges back and forth between the
rocks and debris...only intermittently illuminated by the shotgun
blasts. And then she's gone.

Malvern grimaces as he extracts the blade from his shoulder. Teeth
grit, he moves over to Dodge, who lays on the ground holding his
bloody gut.

                    MALVERN (CONT' D)
          I believe this is yours.

Malvern returns the favor and FLINGS the bowie knife into Dodge's
shoulder. While Dodge writhes in pain, Malvern stalks down the shrine
steps, greeted by Larsen.

                    LARSEN
          The girl's hiding somewhere. Should
          we keep looking?

                    MALVERN
          Don't bother. Bury them both.

                                        CUT TO:

CU - A GRENADE LAUNCHER ejects a series of grenades. We are:

OUTSIDE SHRINE

Larsen is wielding the big gun. Grinning large as he watches the
MULTIPLE BLASTS destabilize the entire underground cavern, setting off
the first of many subterranean EARTHQUAKES.

Impressed with the destruction he's wrought, Larsen hurries to join
Malvern and the other Aussies waiting at the golden archway...which
Larsen blows shut with a final grenade!

FIND Lara emerging from behind a rock. Venturing out when the tremor
stops, moving amidst the crumbling cavern...jogging at first and then
running when she sees Dodge inside the shrine, pulling the bowie knife
from his shoulder.

INSIDE SHRINE

Lara drops to her knees beside Dodge, who is battling death. She
inspects his abdominal wound with deep concern.

                    LARA
          We've got to get you out of here.

Back on her feet, Lara doesn't listen to Dodge's speech; her focused
eyes scan the periphery searching for escape.

                    DODGE
          Don't worry about me. Just get
          yourself out of here.

At the edge of the shrine Lara spots a glimmer of hope...

POV - LARA

The BENT GOLD COLUMN she saw earlier now slopes up to a NEW FISSURE in
the ceiling. It's a tight squeeze but STARS can be seen above. A way
out.

BACK TO SCENE

Lara rushes back to Dodge and starts to drag him.

                    DODGE (CONT'D)
          Forget it, Lara. I got what I
          deserve.

The emotions of watching someone die in her arms is too much for Lara
as her long-suppressed emotions rise to the surface.

                    LARA
          You can still make it, Dodge! Don't
          you dare give up on me now!

Lara keeps dragging Dodge, just as she dragged her father, out of the
shrine. She's reverting back to that defining moment in her life,
trying to convince herself:

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          It's gonna be fine...gonna be fine.

ANOTHER TREMOR ROCKS THE CAVERN! Tearing the shrine in half and
forming a LARGE FISSURE between Lara, Dodge and the escape column.
Dodge grabs onto Lara's arm for emphasis:

                    DODGE
          Listen to me, Lara. I can think of
          worse places to die. I mean, the
          last thing I'll see is all this
          gold.

Sensing his end, Lara's desperate denial begins to crumble like the
walls around her. She kneels beside him again.

                    LARA
          Don't leave me, Dodge. Please.

Lara's eyes are welling with tears. Dodge reaches a hand up to her
face, tries to wipes away thirteen years of pain.

                    DODGE
          You can beat every trap there is,
          Lara. But sometimes you can't beat
          death. No matter how good you are.

They kiss. Like they wanted to the first time they met. A passionate
confession, a cruel hint at what could have been. A tender goodbye
that leaves Lara's lip quivering.

                    DODGE (CONT'D)
          See it through, Lara. For Darby...
          and for me.

Lara nods her acceptance of the challenge. Brusquely rubbing out her
tears, Lara summons her inner strength and walks to the edge of the
fissure.

POV - LARA

She is staring at a jump much like the one she had to make near the
monastery, only further. And this time the lower ground on the other
side is much less forgiving than snow.

BACK TO SCENE

Lara looks back at Dodge, some doubt still clouding her face as the
walls continue to crumble all around them.

                    LARA
          I don't think I can do this, Dodge!

                    DODGE
          Sure you can.
               (beat; the drill)
          Favorite movie.

Lara manages a slight smile despite her anguish.

                    LARA
          Anything with Buster Keaton.

                    DODGE
          Good answer.

Dodge watches as Lara moves away from the fissure's edge, measuring
her steps back to him. Exhaling slowly, Lara gathers herself. Hands
fall to her side; a gymnast before her routine. The cavern begins to
SHAKE & RUMBLE with induced seismic activity. But Lara stays focused.
And with quick, precision steps...she sprints for the edge and
leaps...

...soaring over the chasm...landing on the other side and executing a
perfect TUCK & ROLL. A relieved smile alights her face as she spins
back for Dodge's approval...

POV - LARA

The entire SHRINE has collapsed. Dodge is gone.

BACK TO SCENE

Lara stares down into the LAVA FILLED abyss for a second, recalling
that moment in the Himalayas...but there's no time for regret as
another VIOLENT TREMOR strikes...

Lara runs for the BENT GOLD COLUMN and, as the walls literally fall
around her, she scrambles up the column to her escape.

EXT. CHOQUEQUIRAO - NIGHT

Lara barely squeezes up through the surface FISSURE just as Malvern's
helicopter -- battling the fierce CROSSWINDS -- flees the ruins,
heading for the distant Pacific ocean.

Without hesitation Lara sprints for the edge of the plateau and
reclips a carabiner to the guide line she used earlier. Lara
disappears over the edge. And the chase is on.

                                        CUT TO:

CU - A MAP showing international shipping lanes. A straight course
from Peru to Australia has been highlighted. We are:

INT. DODGE'S SEAPLANE - NIGHT

Lara, now dressed in a scuba suit, has one eye on the sky, another on
Dodge's shipping map. In the distance, Lara can just make out the
outlines of a shipping vessel all lit up on the ocean. Pulling on her
CUSTOMIZED NIGHT GOGGLES:

POV- LARA (THROUGH GOGGLES)

The night-vision filter gives the world a GREEN GLOW. The image ZOOMS
to the ship, where we see Malvern's WHALE LOGO and the words "SEAPRO,
INC."

EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - NIGHT

The seaplane circles around high in the air, then sets down on the
rolling waves a mile or so ahead of Malvern's ship. A beat, then Lara
dives from the plane into the water.

WE HEAR the shipping vessel approaching in the distance, accompanied
by oncoming lights. A HORN blares.

                                        CUT TO:

INT. MALVERN'S SHIP - BRIDGE - NIGHT

An Aussie CAPTAIN points out to Larsen the seaplane directly in the
ship's path.

                    CAPTAIN
          I can stop us or ram it, but it's
          too late to turn at this speed.

                    LARSEN
          Better stop us.

Seconds after the Captain initiates a speed decrease, Larsen's WALKIE-
TALKIE squawks to life.

                    MALVERN (O.S.)
               (over walkie)
          Why the hell're we stopping?

                    LARSEN
          There's a friggin' seaplane in our
          way. Looks like Dodge's.

                    MALVERN (O.S.)
               (over walkie)
          Search the ship. No one gets below.
          Or we're all dead.

EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - NIGHT

The hull of Malvern's ship cuts through the black waters. FIND Lara
watching as the ship passes slowly by...then she makes a daring grab
onto the ship's ANCHOR CHAIN.

EXT. MALVERN'S SHIP - LOWER SURFACE DECK - NIGHT

Lara climbs aboard and creeps around the lower deck past Malvern's
HUEY HELICOPTER parked on the heliport. Lara is on full alert with
both guns drawn, but curiously there doesn't seem to be anyone
topside. So she finds a HATCH providing access to the levels below.

INT. MALVERN'S SHIP - A-LEVEL - NIGHT

Lara quietly searches the corridors for signs of life. Suddenly, she
presses her back against the wall...

CLANK-CLANK-CLANK. The sounds of footsteps on the metal floor heading
her way. Lara ducks into a side room...

INT. MALVERN'S SHIP - A-LEVEL - BUTCHER ROOM - NIGHT

Lara looks around a room filled with a grisly variety of HOOKS, BLADES
AND CHOPPING EQUIPMENT used for Malvern's defunct whaling business.
Lara's nose wrinkles, both with disgust and the lingering smell. Lara
watches an AUSSIE GUARD pass, then she exits quickly...

INT. MALVERN'S SHTP - A-LEVEL - NIGHT

The Aussie Guard doesn't see Lara creep up behind him.

                    LARA
          Howdy mate.

The Aussie spins to see Lara's guns pointed at him.

                    AUSSIE GUARD
          No, no! Don't shoot!

                    LARA
          Fair enough.

Lara PISTOL-WHIPS the guard, who hits the deck, out cold. Lara quickly
searches him...but finds that his holster is curiously empty.

INT. MALVERN'S SHIP - B-LEVEL - NIGHT

Descending a ladder, Lara finds herself deep in the bowels of the
ship. As she peers around a corner:

POV - LARA

Two people in HAZ-MAT suits walk down the corridor. They enter a room
via a temporary AIR LOCK constructed around a HEAVILY REINFORCED STEEL
DOOR.

BACK TO SCENE

Lara hurries to the door. On the wall is a conspicuously new emblem:
the universal symbol for radiation. Lara peers into the room through
the small door PORTHOLE, but the glass is FROSTED; Lara can see only
silhouettes and movement...

Until the dark shape of a haz-mat helmet looms into view! Lara ducks
behind the heavy door as it opens...and it swings right into her; Lara
lets out an involuntary GRUNT.

The HAZ-MAT AUSSIE spins around, alerted. Lara greets him with guns
drawn. The Aussie waves frantically:

                    HAZ-MAT AUSSIE
               (muffled by helmet)
          No, no guns! Please!

                    LARA
          Well isn't this a switch.

Lara holsters her guns. The Haz-Mat Aussie visibly relaxes. Which is
when Lara delivers a vicious KICK to the groin. After the Aussie
doubles over, Lara removes his helmet and drops him where he stands
with an UPPERCUT.

INT. MALVERN'S SHIP - B-LEVEL - NIGHT

Lara emerges from a room wearing the Aussie's haz-mat suit. She heads
for the REINFORCED DOOR, entering like she belongs. But Lara isn't
prepared for the sight that greets her inside.

INT. MALVERN'S SHIP - B-LEVEL - SLAUGHTER ROOM - NIGHT

The room where the ship's catch was gutted, sliced and processed has
been converted into a makeshift factory floor. Lara discreetly
stashes her GUNS behind a shipping crate.

On one side, two haz-mat-suited TECHS delicately load METAL CONTAINERS
with radiation symbols on them into heavily insulated SHIPPING CRATES.
Another tech logs the progress into COMPUTERS. Once the crates are
secure, they are rolled by dolly into a nearby COLD-STORAGE LOCKER.

Three more techs are queued up in front of a clear, two-foot thick
plexi-glass WINDOW. Behind this air-lock divider is Malvern! But
it's impossible for Lara to see exactly what he's up to. So she moves
in for a closer view...

Lara joins the line, careful to avoid the looks of the other
technicians milling about the room. While she waits, Lara peeks over a
tech's shoulder at his computer:

CU - COMPUTER SCREEN: Purchase orders, shipping manifests. Malvern is
selling something to private buyers around the globe for millions more
than the market price of a whale.

Finding herself next in line, Lara sees for the first time: Malvern on
the other side of the plexiglass, his arms encased in protective WALL-
GLOVES, cupping with both hands the BLACK VEIL on Lara's side of the
wall.

The tech in front of her places a piece of SCRAP IRON into the Black
Veil, and as Malvern concentrates BLACK SMOKE billows from the
obsidian cup. As the smoke dissipates, Malvern pours a GRAY LIQUID
into the tech's CONTAINER.

                    LARA
               (eyes wide; sotto)
          Plutonium.

Lara finally arrives at the front of the line. Malvern looks pallid
and moist, the process clearly draining him. He waits for Lara to drop
her scrap iron into the Veil...but she doesn't have any.

                    MALVERN
          What the hell're you doing?

Malvern finally recognizes Lara through her face plate. Lara answers
by grabbing the Black Veil from Malvern's gloved hands. As Lara
hurries for the reinforced door, Malvern yanks his arms from the
gloves and hits and INTERCOM button.

                    MALVERN (CONT'D)
               (over intercom)
          Stop her! Get the Veil!

As the techs realize what's going on, Lara reaches the shipping crates
where she stashed her guns. Suddenly, all activity ceases.

                    MALVERN (CONT'D)
               (over intercom)
          She won't shoot. One stray bullet
          and we're all at ground zero.

                    LARA
          Better us than the rest of the
          world.

The conviction in Lara's voice gives pause to Malvern.

                    MALVERN
               (over intercom)
          Everyone out. Now.

The room empties out quickly through the reinforced door. Larsen joins
him behind the plexiglass in the view room.

                    LARA
          What's the point to all this,
          Malvern? End of the world? That your
          game?

As he speaks, Malvern hits some buttons on a CONTROL PANEL inside the
view room -- we can't see exactly what he's doing.

                    MALVERN
               (over intercom)
          The world's gonna end sooner than
          later, Ms. Croft. Figure I'll go out
          on top when it does. But we need you
          to put down your gun now.

                    LARA
          Dump all the plutonium overboard and
          then we'll talk.

Larsen whispers something to Malvern, who smiles.

                    MALVERN
               (over intercom)
          I've got a better idea. Let's talk
          about one of the precautionary
          measures we've taken here...

Lara looks around, instantly suspicious.

                    MALVERN (CONT'D)
               (over intercom)
          In a radiation-filled environment
          you must be able to remove all the
          air in two minutes.

Lara reacts as her haz-mat suit starts to CINCH to her body! Malvern
has initiated the air removal process.

                    MALVERN (CONT'D)
          Ever seen a fish out of water,
          flapping around? It's not a pretty
          sight. You can see the panic in
          their eyes...until they start
          popping out their sockets.

Larsen waves at Lara, sucking in his lips to resemble a fish.
Panicking, Lara points a gun at him and fires! But nothing happens.
Lara points both her guns at the plutonium -- CLICK. CLICK. CLICK.

                    MALVERN (CONT'D)
               (over intercom)
          Did I forget to mention that with no
          oxygen your gun can't fire?

Larsen and Malvern share a cruel LAUGH inside the view room.

                    MALVERN (CONT'D)
          G'Day, Ms. Croft.

As Lara's face plate fogs up and her body stiffens, the guns slip from
her hands. Staggering around the room, Lara stumbles inexplicably into
the COLD-STORAGE LOCKER, which she closes behind her.

INT. MALVERN'S SHIP - B-LEVEL - VIEW ROOM - NIGHT

Lara is now out of sight from the view room. Larsen shoots Malvern a
confused look.

                    LARSEN
          What's the hell's she doing now?

                    MALVERN
          British pride. Doesn't want to give
          us the pleasure of watching her die.
               (then)
          Let's, get this ship moving again.
          We've got orders to fill.

The two men exit the view room.

INT. MALVERN'S SHIP - B-LEVEL - COLD STORAGE LOCKER - NIGHT

Lara leans against the back wall of the locker, which is filled with
CRATES OF STORED, SHIELDED PLUTONIUM.

Her breathing extremely labored now, Lara slides down the wall into a
sitting position. Her eyes show the understandable panic coursing
through her veins. But then her eyes focus on the Black Veil in her
hands, still filled with plutonium. With the last reserves of strength
she has, Lara closes her eyes and concentrates. BLACK SMOKE starts to
billow from the Veil, sucked into the AIR VENTS overhead.

INT. MALVERN'S SHIP - A-LEVEL - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Heading back, Malvern and Larsen look at one another incredulously as
KLAXONS begin to blare.

                    LARSEN
          A breach? That's impossible.

                    MALVERN
          Get up top. Take everyone with you.
          The only way off this ship's up
          there.

Larsen hurries up a ladder as Malvern reverses direction, heading back
downstairs...

                                        CUT TO:

CU - A HOLE

in the corridor wall leading into the cold storage locker; the edges
are frozen and brittle. We are:

INT. MALVERN'S SHIP - B-LEVEL - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Malvern, now wearing a haz-mat suit, examines the HOLE with a
flashlight.

                    LARA (O.S.)
          Liquid nitrogen.

Dodge whirls around to find Lara armed with a SPEAR HOOK.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          The Veil works with any element.

Malvern turns to run, but Lara snags him on the thigh with the spear
hook, then yanks him back -- he lands at her feet, his haz-mat suit
torn exposing bleeding flesh.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          Now you know how those whales felt.

Lara twirls around the spear hook, switching to the wooden handle end,
and SMASHES Malvern's face plate!

INT.MALVERN'S SHIP - B-LEVEL - VIEW ROOM - NIGHT

Lara enters the view room, removes her helmet and watches Malvern
regain consciousness.

                    LARA
               (over intercom)
          Here's an interesting fact: with the
          amount of radiation presently
          soaking into your body, the rest of
          your journey to Australia will be a
          painful one indeed.

Malvern sits up, slowly comprehending his predicament.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          First, you'll be overcome with
          nausea. Next comes the blood from
          every orifice -- very messy. Then
          out falls the hair, which in your
          case may be more of a blessing. And
          finally, if you're still alive, you
          go deaf, dumb and blind. Not
          necessarily in that order.
               (beat)
          G'Day.

As Lara leaves, Malvern bangs furiously on the plexiglass. But then he
remembers a way out and heads for COLD STORAGE.

                                        CUT TO:

EXT. MALVERN'S SHIP - UPPER SURFACE - CARGO AREA - NIGHT

Stripped back to her scuba outfit, Lara hurries up a ladder and finds
herself in the middle of an assortment of CRATES. Various labels
indicate that the crates contain weapons and ammunition. Lara opens a
crate marked "DANGER: EXPLOSIVES!" Inside are a dozen SMALL METALLIC
BOXES marked "Plastique." Emptying one of the boxes, Lara places the
BLACK VEIL inside.

EXT. MALVERN'S SHIP - UPPER SURFACE DECK - NIGHT

Larsen sits at one of the ship's TWO HARPOON GUNS. As he barks orders
at the MERCENARIES on deck, his walkie speaks:

                    AUSSIE GUARD (O.S.)
               (over walkie; whispers)
          I see her. Upper deck, above the
          chopper.

Larsen spins in the harpoon chair to see: Lara creeps along the upper
deck towards Malvern's Huey. Larsen pivots the harpoon gun, licking
his lips in anticipation.

                    LARSEN
               (into walkie; whispers)
          Everybody port side. Now.

FOLLOW LARA as she scampers along the shadowy deck, the METALLIC BOX
(with the Veil inside) tucked under her arm --

-- TCTCTCTCTCTCTCTC!!! The upper deck erupts in UZI FIRE. Lara dives
for cover as bullets ricochet off the deck and walls.

As Larsen carefully lines up a shot with the harpoon gun...

Lara RUNS AND SHOOTS with her single gun until all her bullets are
spent. She keeps running for the Huey but --

-- AN AUSSIE GUARD appears in Lara's path with a SHOTGUN!

                    AUSSIE GUARD
          End of the line, Missie.

Just then, Larsen fires the harpoon gun! THE HARPOON flies towards
Lara, trailing a thick STEEL CABLE. Lara sees it coming before the
Aussie Guard, so she SIDE-FLIPS with a HALF TWIST in the air,
reversing her direction!

The harpoon misses Lara by inches...but impales the Aussie Guard and
sticks in a crate down on the lower surface deck!

                    LARSEN
          Goddammit!

Larsen abandons the harpoon gun and takes chase on foot as...

Lara grabs up the Aussie's shotgun and cracks it open. With the
METALLIC BOX between her feet, Lara uses the V'd shotgun to ZIP DOWN
the harpoon's steel cable to the lower surface deck where the Huey is
parked!

RACK FOCUS on Malvern emerging from the lower levels.

INT. MALVERN'S HUEY HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

Lara hops into the chopper, placing the METALLIC BOX onto the seat
next to her. She quickly gets the rotors going and starts to lift from
the deck...but not before Larsen jumps from the side of the ship and
grabs onto the landing struts!

After Larsen pulls himself up into the back of the chopper...

EXT. MALVERN'S SHIP - UPPER SURFACE DECK - CONTINUOUS

His sweaty face knotted with maniacal fury, Malvern stands at the
other harpoon gun, one eye squinted on his target: the rising
chopper --

-- KA-SHOOOOOOOOOP! The harpoon arcs through the night sky snaring the
landing struts! Malvern smiles a twisted smile as the Huey becomes a
fly on a string above him!

                    MALVERN
          Reel her in.

One of the Aussies takes over the harpoon controls from Malvern. Now
the hydraulic engines start to pull the chopper down towards the
ship!

INT. MALVERN'S HUEY HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

Abandoning the now useless controls, Lara reaches for the METALLIC BOX
...but Larsen puts a boot hard down on her hand.

                    LARSEN
          I read somewhere that British girls
          like it rough.

Larsen viciously backhands Lara, who stumbles to her knees inside the
cabin. Now armed with the metallic box, Larsen stands over Lara, fully
enjoying his position of power.

                    LARSEN (CONT'D)
          Tell you what. Beg for your life
          like Erikson did and I'll make it a
          quickie for you.

Lara's eyes suddenly burn with a rage we haven't seen before. She LEG
WHIPS Larsen down to the floor and ELBOWS his windpipe with such force
that he releases the metallic box.

EXT. MALVERN'S SHIP - UPPER SURFACE DECK - CONTINUOUS

Malvern and the rest of the Aussie contingent stare up at the circling
helicopter...slowly being reeled in closer to the ship by the Aussie
controlling the harpoon gun!

INT. MALVERN'S HUEY HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

Lara and Larsen continue to slug it out inside the chopper, which
lurches on the end of the harpoon line -- Lara goes tumbling against
the wall. Larsen takes the opportunity to grab back the metallic box,
which he raises above his head to smash in Lara's skull.

                    LARA
          You wanna know how British girls
          really like it?

Larsen hesitates for just a second, allowing Lara to KICK him out the
open side of the chopper.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          With us on top.

EXT. MALVERN'S SHIP - LOWER SURFACE DECK - CONTINUOUS

The Huey has been pullea within 30' of the deck, so the fall doesn't
immediately kill Larsen, who smashes down into some SHIPPING CRATES.

Malvern and the other Aussies hurry down to the lower deck. With blood
trickling from his mouth, Larsen holds up the metallic box. A
victorious grin despite the pain.

                    LARSEN
          I...I got the Veil.

INT. MALVERN'S HUEY HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

Lara cleverly maneuvers the chopper so that the steel cable wraps
around the Aussie at the controls of the harpoon gun...

EXT. MALVERN'S SHIP - LOWER SURFACE - CONTINUOUS

Malvern reaches down and takes the metallic box from Larsen. A faint
TICKING can be heard. A worried look crosses Malvern's face as he
opens the box to see Lara's ruse:

CU - A BRICK OF PLASTIOUE rigged to blow in five seconds!

INT. MALVERN'S HUEY HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

Lara pitches the Huey so she can get a clear view of the harpoon gun,
then uses the cable to crush the Aussie at the controls against the
harpoon RELEASE LEVER -- Klank!

Finally free and clear, Lara pushes the Huey to its limit, speeding
away from the ship as THE NIGHT SKY GOES RED!

EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - CONTINUOUS

The red flash fades to white, revealing A NUCLEAR MUSHROOM growing up
from the water. The Huey Helicopter flies right at the camera, chased
by the ENERGY WAVE. But Lara never looks back. And as the helicopter
hits escape velocity, we;

CU - LONDON HERALD HEADLINE reads: "New Evidence of El Dorado

INT. BENTLEY ARNAGE - DAY

Lara, relaxing in the back seat, finishing the article.

                    LARA
          Bravo, boys.

She kisses two fingers and applies the sentiment to each man's
picture.

Karak drives with one eye on Lara in the rear-view mirror.

                    KARAK
          I take it your trip was...
          rejuvenating?

                    LARA
          Wonderfully so, Karak.

                    KARAK
          Did you find what you were looking
          for?

Lara thinks about this for a moment, then half-smiles.

                    LARA
          Yes.
               (pause)
          Yes, I think I finally did.

                    KARAK
          You haven't forgotten about your
          Aunt's cocktail party?

                    LARA
               (instant dread)
          Is that tonight?

                    KARAK
               (wry)
          You can run, Lara, but you can't
          hide.

                                        CUT TO:

INT. AUNT EV'S FLAT - NIGHT

This impressive West End flat is peopled with ELDERLY MEN in tuxes and
AGING WOMEN draped in demure dresses and ostentatious jewelry. Aunt Ev
flits about, hosting a cocktail party for the upper crust of British
society.

Suddenly, the din of vapid conversation drops a notch. All eyes --
especially male -- fall firmly upon:

LARA crossing the room in black stiletto heels and a sheer, blood-red
dress that hides everything...and yet nothing. Oddly, she's carrying a
BRIEFCASE.

As Lara confidently makes her way across the room, the sea of party-
goers parts magically before her. Aunt Ev spots her and hurries over.

                    EVELYN
          Lara! I'm so glad you could make it.
          And look at you -- that vacation did
          you a world of good.

                    LARA
          It was a brilliant suggestion, Aunt
          Ev. May we speak alone for a moment?

                    EVELYN
          Yes, but only a moment. So many
          people to attend to, you know.

INT. AUNT EV'S FLAT - LIBRARY - NIGHT

Lara and Evelyn enter a lushly-decorated sitting room. A warm fire
from the hearth illuminates the room. Lara opens her briefcase and
pulls out a stack of LEGAL PAPERS.

                    LARA
          I've signed the paperwork, as
          promised.

                    EVELYN
          How proud your mother would be, to
          see you filling her shoes so nicely.

                    LARA
          Oh, I almost forgot -- I brought you
          a little souvenir from my travels...

She hands her aunt THE BLACK VEIL.

                    EVELYN
               (hates it)
          You're so...thoughtful.

As Evelyn walks around looking for a spot to place the Veil:

                    EVELYN (CONT'D)
          I just don't know what to do with
          all these knickknacks you give me.

REVEAL almost every horizontal surface in the room is occupied by the
incredible ARTIFACTS Lara has given her.

                    EVELYN (CONT'D)
          Scions, daggers... Where in the
          world do you ever find these things?

                    LARA
          Oh, here and there...

Impatient, Evelyn finally crams the Black Veil in a lower cubby hole,
completely out of sight.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          I would love to stay, but I have
          another very important engagement.

                    EVELYN
               (ears perk up)
          Engagement? Who's the lucky fellow?

                    LARA
               (deadpan; teases her)
          Actually, there are three of them.

Off of Evelyn's confounded look, we;

                                        CUT TO:

INT. THE WORLD'S END PUB - NIGHT

Her red dress hiked up, Lara sits on a stool between the Gadget Boys
--Stuart, Liam & Wesley. They are all drinking from a pint of dark
ale.

                    STUART
          So how was your trip?

                    LIAM
          What happened this time?

                    WESLEY
          You nail any baddies?

                    LARA
          Such imaginations...

Lara enjoys her beer as the TV above the bar broadcasts a NEWS REPORT
over images of the blasted remains of Malvernis SHIPPING VESSEL
floating in ocean.

                    NEWSCASTER
          ...officials are uncertain what
          initiated the nuclear blast, which
          fortunately was far enough from all
          major land masses to pose any threat
          of fallout...

The Gadget Boys all turn in unison to stare at Lara.

                    STUART
          That was you wasn't it?

                    LARA
               (feigns indignation)
          Let me remind you, I am a proper
          British girl.

The Gadget Boys aren't sure what to believe as Lara finishes her beer
in one big, unladylike swig.

                    LARA (CONT'D)
          Most of the time anyway.

Lara's sly smirk elicits smiles from the boys, as we;
