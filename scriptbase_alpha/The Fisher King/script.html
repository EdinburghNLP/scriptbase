        INT. DARKENED BEDROOM - DAWN

        CLOSEUP ON RADIO/ALARM CLOCK reads 5:59 a.m.  The digital
        numbers flip to 6:00 and the RADIO goes on:  a talk show
        host speaks in a soft, soothing voice:

                                JACK (V.O.)
                  It's six a.m.... Ooooooo and that bed
                  never felt sooooo gooood... Mmmm, you
                  linger in a warm, gentle dream
                  state... ever so comfortable... ever
                  so safe...

        SFX:  LOUD BATTLE NOISE

                                JACK (V.O.)
                      (continuing)
               ... <u>But suddenly you realize it's</u>
               <u>Monday</u>!

        A woman SCREAMS... the D.J., JACK, speaks at a rapid fire
        pace... a HAND from O.S. tries to shut the alarm off in
        the dark.

                                JACK (V.O.)
                      (continuing)
               ... your hand races to shut off the
               alarm before your mind wakes up...

        SCREAMS... the HAND knocks over a water glass and grabs
        the clock but can't find the off switch.

                                JACK (V.O.)
                      (continuing)
               ... But it's too late!  If you don't
               get out of bed now, you'll never have
               enough time to blow dry your hair
               <u>that special way</u>... You'll never make
               that nine o'clock meeting that your
               <u>partner will be early for</u>... <u>You will</u>
               <u>be late and everyone will notice</u>!

        The HAND bangs the clock violently...

                                JACK (V.O.)
                      (continuing)
               ... Rumors will fly about you losing
               your edge... Someone will casually
               mention they saw you downing shots of
               tequila at the Xmas party and before
               you know it, you're spilling your
               guys to a Senate committee or selling
               yourself on street corners to middle
               aged men from the Midwest...
               Headlines flash across your mind --
               "<u>Sleeping Investment Banker Guns D.J.</u>
               <u>Then Self -- Claimed -- 'I only</u>
               <u>wanted two more minutes</u>!'"

        SCREAMS... SILENCE... The D.J. (Jack) speaks in a normal
        voice.

                                JACK (V.O.)
                      (continuing)
               ... Hey, it's Monday morning, and I'm
               Jack Lucas.

        The HAND rips the clock off the night table.

        INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

        A WOMAN in a bathrobe spoons the contents of a protein
        drink called Executive Protein Blast into blender...

                                WOMAN (V.O.)
                      (upset)
               ... I don't have to talk to you.

                                JACK (V.O.)
               Yes... Yes, you do because you see,

        INT. BATHROOM - MORNING

        A naked man shaves as he listens to the RADIO.

                                JACK (V.O.)
               And in the spirit of fairness, we
               want the public to hear your side of
               things.  So, now... how long were you
               and Senator Peyton having this sleazy
               affair?               

                                WOMAN (V.O.)
                      (angry)
               I am tired of the public thinking
               they've got the right to invade a
               person's private life.


        INT. BATHROOM - MORNING

        A woman sensually applying lipstick and makeup as:

                                JACK (V.O.)
               <u>Oh please</u>!... You had sex with a
               United States Senator in the parking
               lot of Sea World... You're telling me
               you're a private kind of person.
               No... you're our...

                                PRE-RECORDED ECHOING (V.O.)
               <u>Spotlight Celebrity</u>...

                                WOMAN (V.O.)
               That's still all anybody talks about.
               Nobody even thinks to ask whether we
               loved each other.


        EXT. WALL STREET AREA - MORNING

        Hordes of business people stampeding towards their
        jobs...

                                JACK (V.O.)
               Because nobody cares about that,
               sweetheart.  Nobody wants to hear
               about your romantic love.  No.  We
               want to hear about the back seats of
               limos... the ruined lives of people
               we want to be... new and exotic uses
               for champagne corks...


        INT. COFFEE SHOP - MORNING

        People line up to buy coffee and danish.

                                WOMAN (V.O.)
               Listen, I have been humiliated enough
               already!

                                JACK (V.O.)
               Perhaps not -- We need those
               details...

        The Woman hangs up...

                                JACK AND CREW
               Ooooo...

        INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - MORNING

        Escalators packed with people move like conveyor belts:

                                JACK (V.O.)
                  Hi, this is Jack Lucas and we're
                  discussing personal pet peeves.  Go
                  ahead, caller.

                                CALLER (V.O.)
                  Okay... well... It's my husband...

                                JACK (V.O.)
                  Huh-huh.


        GRAND CENTRAL - MAIN FLOOR - MORNING

        Hundreds of people moving like ants in every direction:

                                CALLER (V.O.)
                  He drives me crazy.  I'll be talking
                  and he'll never let me finish a
                  sentence... He's always finishing
                  my...

                                JACK (V.O.)
                      (overlaps)
                  -- Finishing your thoughts.  That's
                  awful.


        EXT. MIDTOWN NEW YORK - MORNING

        Midtown traffic.  Angry cab drivers yelling at
        pedestrians.

                                CALLER (V.O.)
                  Oh!  It absolutely drives me...

                                JACK (V.O.)
                      (cuts her off)
                  -- Drives you crazy, huh?  The
                  scoundrel.

        EXT. 30 ROCKEFELLER PLAZA - MORNING

                                CALLER (V.O.)
                  Hello Jack.  It's Edwin.

                                JACK AND CREW (V.O.)
                  <u>It's Edwin</u>!!!!

        "HAPPY DAYS ARE HERE AGAIN" plays then is abruptly
        stopped.

                                JACK (V.O.)
                      (continuing)
                  Edwin.  We haven't heard from you in
                  what -- a day?... I've missed you.


        INT. EDWIN'S APARTMENT - MORNING

        INTERCUT Edwin on phone.


        INT. RADIO STUDIO - MORNING

        OVERHEAD SHOT of radio host as he speaks, while he
        manipulates tapes, dials, switches, etc... at a breakneck
        speed...

                                EDWIN (V.O.)
                  I've missed you too, Jack.

                                JACK AND CREW (O.S.)
                  Awwww.......!

        SFX:  "A SUMMER PLACE" -- THE NEEDLE IS SCRATCHED OFF

        Edwin laughs, perhaps a bit over zealously -- He is a
        simple minded soul... a lonely child in the body of a
        lonely man.

                                JACK (O.S.)
                  So, Edwin, baby, this is Sunrise
                  Confession time... what have you got
                  for us?

                                EDWIN (V.O.)
                  I... I... went to this bar... this
                  very, ya know -- hard-to-get-in
                  place... called Babbitt's...

        The HANDS of the radio host pushing buttons, bending a
        paperclip out of shape...

                                JACK (O.S.)
                  Yeah, I know the place.  It's one of
                  those chic <u>yuppie</u> gathering holes.

                                EDWIN (V.O.)
                      (simple minded laughter)
                  Okay... I know but... I met this
                  beautiful girl...

        Host's HANDS pop in a tape  "WEDDING BELLS," then a
        NEEDLE scratching it off.

                                JACK (O.S.)
                  Now, Edwin, if you start telling me
                  you're in love again, I'm going to
                  have to remind you of the time we
                  made you propose to that check-out
                  girl at Thrifty's that you liked so
                  much.  Remember her reaction...

        Another TAPE, another button pressed:

                                BLACK SEVENTIES GROUP (V.O.)
                         (sings)
                  "Mister Big Stuff... Huh... Tell
                  me... Who do you think you are...
                  Mister Big Stuff... you're never
                  gonna get my love..."

                                EDWIN (V.O.)
                         (defensive)
                  I wasn't serious about her, Jack.
                  That was just a joke for you guys...
                  She was just a girl.  This is a
                  beautiful woman.  She wears pearls.

        CAMERA KEEPS MOVING about the studio and the host, but we
        never see his face:

                                JACK (O.S.)
                  Yeah, but does she swallow, Edwin?

                                EDWIN (V.O.)
                  I think she likes me... she gave me
                  her number, but she must work a lot
                  cause when I call she's never home...
                  But I think we'll go out this
                  weekend... I've...

                                JACK (O.S.)
                  Yeah, Edwin, <u>sure</u>... and <u>Pinnochio</u> is
                  a true story... <u>Edwin!  Wake up!</u>
                  This is a fairytale...

        The crew perform their duties with little enthusiasm.

                                EDWIN (V.O.)
                  No, Jack, no, it's not... She likes
                  me.

                                JACK (O.S.)
                  She gave you the old brusheroo,
                  kiddo... Believe me -- this tart will
                  never make it to your desert plate...

                                EDWIN (V.O.)
                         (hurt)
                  She <u>likes</u> me.  She said for me to
                  call!

                                MICHAEL MCDONALD (V.O.)
                         (sings)
                  "What a fool believes... He sees..."

                                EDWIN (V.O.)
                         (over the song)
                  <u>Jack</u>!

                                JACK (O.S.)
                  Edwin... Edwin... Edwin... I told you
                  about these people.  They only mate
                  with their own kind.  It's called
                  <u>Yuppie-In-Breeding</u>... that's why so
                  many of them are retarded and wear
                  the same clothes.  They're not human.
                  They can't feel love.  They can only
                  negotiate love moments.  They're
                  evil, Edwin.  They're repulsed by
                  imperfection and horrified by the
                  banal -- everything America stands
                  for.  Edwin, they have to be stopped
                  before it's too late.  It's us or
                  them.

        Slight pause, as EDWIN considers this.

                                EDWIN (V.O.)
                         (serious)
                  Okay, Jack.

        END CREDITS.

        CAMERA PANS from a wall clock as JACK LUCAS winds up his
        broadcast:

                                JACK LUCAS (O.S.)
                  Well, folks... It's been a thrill, as
                  always.
                         (false sincerity)
                  "Have a perfect day"...

        WE PAN several studio technicians making ready for the
        end of the broadcast to the talk show host Jack Lucas --
        handsome, aggressive, intelligent -- an underground media
        star.

                                JACK
                  Everyone here on the Jack Lucas

                  This is Jack Lucas... So long...
                  arriverderch... I'll be sure to send
                  you a thought today as I lie in the
                  backseat of my stretch limo, have sex
                  with the teenager of my choice... And
                  that thought will be:  Thank God I'm
                  me!

        Jack motions to techy behind glass.  Then leans back in
        his chair, as a RADIO COMMERCIAL begins.

        His expression seems grave -- not one you would expect
        after a successful broadcast.  He appears tired and
        annoyed.  He sighs in relief that it is over.  The studio
        team work around him in silence -- with no indication of
        the relationship they have "on air."  Jack pulls out a
        bottle of aspirins and takes two.

                                JACK
                         (continuing; annoyed,
                          to the room)
                  I want you all to know I'm getting
                  sick again and it's because someone
                  keeps forgetting to raise the
                  thermostat before I come in here...
                  My fucking ass is freezing for the
                  first hour.

        A techy makes mocking faces behind his back.  Another
        techy suppresses a laugh.

        LOU ROSEN, Jack's agent, who sits in the backseat beside
        Jack, thumbing through the script and chuckling to
        himself.  Jack stares in silence out the window.

                  You know some of this is very funny.
                  Cheever told me they've even secured
                  the rights to the Donna Summer song
                  to play over the credits.

                  read unless I have an offer.

                                LOU
                  Jack, of course... Not even a
                  question.  When I spoke to him on the
                  phone this morning, I could actually
                  smell how much they want you for it.
                  I could smell it over the phone.

        A street bum, half dressed, walks in between the stopped
        cars, banging on the windows and asking for money.  He
        BANGS on Jack's window.  Jack stares at him through the
        tinted glass.

                                LOU

                         (looks at the bum)
                  A couple of quarters isn't going to
                  make any difference anyway.

        The bum looks at the reflection of himself in the
        mirrored window.

        Continuing to a CLOSE UP of the headline of a sensation-
        alist tabloid -- "WOMAN KILLS PLASTIC SURGEON THEN SELF,
        TOLD FRIENDS; I CAN'T BLINK WITHOUT PAIN."

        The picture of a bug-eyed society woman is below the
        caption.  A hand comes out from behind the paper,
        reaching for a bottle of scotch on the table.  The bottle
        disappears behind the paper.

        ANNE, the owner of the store, enters abruptly -- closing
        the office door behind her, a cigarette dangling for her
        mouth.  Her desk is organized litter -- her walls are
        filled with porno tapes.  She searches for one as she
        talks:

                                ANNE
                  These people are insane today.
                  They took insane pills...

        A bit about Anne as she searches for a video:  Anne is in
        her mid-to-late thirties... and she is all woman!  She
        has a raw, earthy, unmistakable sensuality.  Her red
        lipstick matches her red nail polish like a hat and glove
        set.  Inlaid on each nail is a rhinestone design of a
        little star.  Her angora sweaters are tight and clinging,
        giving her breasts a decided lift and perkiness.  Her
        backless pumps slap the ground.  A half-smoked cigarette
        hangs out of her mouth with great expertise -- a skill
        Anne obviously picked up in a high school bathroom.  Her
        voice is thick with a delicious Brooklyn twang.

        She is pure streetwise in attitude, philosophy and emotions.
        She turns and speaks to the man behind the tabloid.

                         (continuing)
                  Hey!  Mr. Happiness!

        The man lowers the newspaper:  it is Jack Lucas: no
        longer the aggressive radio star but more -- a man who
        looks like he hasn't slept in months.  An intolerant,
        paranoid, self-pitying misanthrope.  The outrageous
        articles fascinate him.  Anne removes the paper and
        scotch bottle.

                                ANNE
                         (continuing)
                  Are we going to work today or what?

        Jack stares back.  Anne waits for an answer.  Jack looks
        through the open office door and sees the store is packed
        with rush hour customers -- any one, a potential mass
        murderer.

                                ANNE

        cautiously.

        INT. VIDEO POP - DAY

        Jack's POV -- CAMERA MOVES "cautiously," taking in the
        crowd as they move about the walls of movies.  Suddenly,
        the giant face of a FRUMPY SECRETARY -- POPS INTO FRAME.

                                FRUMPY SECRETARY
                         (to JACK)
                  Can you help me!...

        Jack subtly shudders at the surprise.  He stares deadpan.

                                FRUMPY SECRETARY
                         (continuing)
                  ... I'm at an absolute loss.  I've
                  been looking for an hour -- I'm
                  losing my mind.
                         (overly dramatic,
                          rambling on)
                  ... I'm sort of in the mood for a
                  Katharine Hepburny, Cary Granty kinda
                  thing -- Nothing heavy... I couldn't
                  take heavy.  Somethin' zany.  I need
                  zany.

        JACK stares at her, at a loss. SHE gets an inspiration.

                                     FRUMPY SECRETARY
                   ...OH! OH! Do you have anything with that...
                   comedian who's on that show? What's it -
                   ON THAT RADIO!  Ya know,  the guy that
                   says "HEY...FORGIVE ME...!

        JACK grins his teeth and stares like a madman while ANNE,
        aware of the affect this phrase has on him, throws a worried
        look from the cash register.  The FRUMPY SECRETARY laughs:

                                     FRUMPY SECRETARY
                   I get such a kick outta the way
                   he says that...He's so adorable!
                   Didn't he make a movie...
                   I need something like that -
                   a funny, no brainy kinda thing.

        JACK stares at the woman manically then turns to the shelves of 
        movies behind the desk. Selecting one, he hands it to her.

                                     FRUMPY SECRETARY
                   Great...
                    (reading box aloud)
                   "ORDINARY PEEPHOLES"

        THE WOMAN'S eyes go wide. JACK stares at her deadpan.

                                     JACK
                   It's kind of a - Big Titty-
                   Spread Cheeky kinda thing...

        ANNE, who has heard this entire exchange, has to bite her
        lip to prevent herself from laughing...SHE pulls JACK away.

                                     ANNE
                   ...I'm sorry.
                      (almost laughing)
                   I need to borrow him for a moment.

        As ANNE tugs at his sleeve, JACK eyes the WOMAN like a maniac
        being lead away from his prey.

        INT. VIDEO POP OFFICE - DAY.

        ANNE stands before JACK who leans against her office door.

                                     ANNE
                   Are you in a mood today baby? Is this one of
                   those days when you're in ...whadda call it...
                   an emotional abyss?  Talk to me, cause I don't
                   understand these moods.

                                     JACK
                   Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to
                   understand moods, have one of your own!

                                     ANNE
                   Why don't you go upstairs... take the day off.
                   All right?...I'll cook tonight.

        SHE kisses him, then exits. JACK is not comforted in the least
        by this show of affection - especially when he notices her bra
        strap sticking out from her sweater.

                                     JACK
                   Are you going for a specific look with this?

        INT. ANNE'S APARTMENT ABOVE VIDEO POP - NIGHT (RAINING)

        Anne and Jack sit around a formica kitchen table in
        silence after eating dinner.  Anne smokes a cigarette.  A
        portable TV sits on a stand before them --


        SITCOM ON TV (INTERCUT WITH ANNE'S APT.)

        We hear a STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHING on the TV... Anne
        herself can't help but laugh.  She snorts from trying to
        keep it in.  Jack shoots her a dirty look.

                                ANNE
                  Well, it's funny!  Whatta want from
                  me?

                                JACK
                  It's not funny.  It's... sophomoric
                  and mindless... and dumb.

                                ANNE
                  Then why the hell do we watch all the
                  time?

                                JACK
                         (in one breath)
                  Because it makes me feel good to see
                  how not funny it is and how America
                  doesn't know the first thing about
                  funny which makes it easier not being
                  a famous funny TV celebrity because
                  that would just mean that I'm not
                  really talented.

                                TV ACTOR (V.O.)
                  <u>Well forgiivvee meee</u>...

        APPLAUSE and LAUGHTER... Anne just stares at Jack.

                                ANNE
                  You're a sick fuck... I don't know
                  why you torture yourself.
                         (she hits his head)
                  Too many thoughts -- too crowded in
                  there.  You should read a book.

        She picks up her paperback and begins to read.

                                JACK
                  It's important to think.  It's what
                  separates us from lentils... and
                  people who read books like...
                         (reading her paperback
                          cover)
                  ... "Love's Flower Bed."

        He gets up to get a drink from Anne's makeshift bar.

                                ANNE
                         (defensive)
                  It happens to be a beautiful love
                  story.
                         (hurt)
                  Ya know, you used to like that about
                  me.  You used to say you liked that I
                  didn't make you think so much.  That
                  we could be together and not think...

                                JACK
                  Yeah, well... suicidal paranoiacs say
                  funny things sometimes.

        Anne is deeply hurt by this.  She gathers her dignity and
        exits into the bedroom, slamming the door behind her.
        Jack downs his drink as the sitcom returns to the TV O.S.

        Fed up, Jack throws his coat on, storms out and slams the

        EXT. PLAZA HOTEL - NIGHT - RAIN

        A wet Jack stops to watch the goings on at the entrance.
        He sees a limousine at the Plaza -- parked and awaiting
        its occupants.  A handsome man in his forties exits the
        hotel and walks toward the limo.  He is holding the hand
        of his six year old SON, who is carrying a two foot high
        plastic, smiling Pinnochio doll.  Both father and son are
        dressed in ties and jackets.  Jack watches in envy.  His
        ripped, wet clothes a shabby reflection of the man's.  He
        eyes the limo with longing.  As the man tips the doorman,
        a BUM approaches and asks for money.  When the man
        refuses and turns his back to enter the limp, the Bum
        becomes aggressive and starts pulling at the man's jacket
        and yells:

                                BUM
                  <u>Merry fucking Christmas</u>... <u>Happy</u>
                  <u>fucking New Year</u>!!

        He continues to harass the man, who pushes his son away.
        The doorman comes to the man's rescue.  As they both try
        to pull the Bum off the man, the six year old son notices
        Jack and walks calmly over.

        Jack, mesmerized by the scene, doesn't notice the Boy.

                                BOY (O.S.)
                  Mr. Bum.

        Jack looks down.  The Boy stands directly before him.
        Jack sort of smiles.  The Boy extends his arms and offers
        the Pinnochio doll to Jack.  Jack is confused but the Boy
        simply deposits the doll into his arms and walks back to
        the limo.  By that time, the Bum is being held by the
        doorman, and both father and son enter the limo.

        Jack holds the doll.  He is surrounded by street people
        asleep or drunk on the sidewalk near the hotel.  He
        angrily realizes there's not much difference between him
        and them.

                                JACK
                  Anybody here named Jimeny?

        A drunk groans.  Jack snaps the doll under his arm and
        walks O.S.

        EXT. EAST RIVER, NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT

        CLOSEUP of two feet standing beneath the railing
        overlooking the East River.  Taped to one ankle is a
        brick.  Taped to the other is a brick around a smiling
        Pinnochio doll.  An empty bottle of liquor drops to the
        ground and shatters.

        Jack stands prepared to surrender his fate and make the
        final leap.  He stares at the river, almost smiling.  He
        has made his decision.  He is calm and serene.  He raises
        his foot over the railing.

        The headlights of a car drive INTO FRAME, illuminating
        Jack.  He turns to see:

                                LEATHER (O.S.)
                  What's going on?...

        Two white upperclass JUEVENILE DELINQUENTS -- one wearing
        a leather jacket, the other a high school windbreaker --
        get out of the car.  Each is carrying a gallon of
        gasoline.  Leather also carries a bat.  Jack is drunk but
        he is immediately aware of the danger when he spots the
        gasoline cans.

                                LEATHER
                  I said what's going on?
                         (walks up to Jack)
                  What are you doing here?

        Jack shakes his head and before he knows it, Leather
        shoves the bat into his gut, sinking Jack to his knees.
        Windbreaker places the gasoline cans on the bench and
        begins to unscrew them.

                                LEATHER
                         (continuing)
                  You shouldn't hang around this
                  neighborhood.

                         (clutching his stomach)
                  I... I was just leaving.

                                LEATHER
                  People spend a lot of hard earned
                  money for this neighborhood.  It's
                  not fair... looking out their windows
                  to see your ass asleep on the 
                  streets...

                                JACK
                  Yes... I... I agree...

                  Good.
                         (to Windbreaker)
                  You believe this drunk?

        Windbreaker shakes his head.

        WINDBREAKER hands LEATHER the can, who raises it above JACK'S
        head. AS THE GASOLINE SLOWLY LEAKS ONTO A PETRIFIED JACK SEES A
        FIGURE MOVING OUT FROM THE DARKNESS.

                                     FIGURE
                   <u>All</u> <u>hope</u> <u>abandon,</u> <u>ye</u> <u>who</u> <u>enter</u> <u>here</u>!

        Startled, THE YOUTHS TURN to the shadows.

                                     LEATHER
                   What the-....

        AN ARROW with a rubber suction tip comes flying out of the
        dark and connects to WINDBREAKER's groin.

                                     WINDBREAKER
                   AHHH!

        A FIGURE stands backlit - mysterious and powerful, noble and
        fearless. JACK, LEATHER and WINDBREAKER instinctually bond
        together in the face of this fourth unknown entity.

        The figure turns out to be a BUM. Grimy face, tattered layers
        of clothing beneath a long over coat, a pork pie hat with a
        twig sticking out of it like a plume in a helmet of yore.
        Over his shoulder, a homemade bow and arrow set.
        Although clearly downtrodden, behind his beaten appearance, there
        radiates a calm intelligence and strength. There is something
        distinctly attractive and confident about him. We learn later
        his name is PARRY; a combination of Don Quixote and Harpo Marx.
        PARRY  stands before them absolutely delighted with himself -
        hand on hip - beaming with pride..

                                     PARRY
                   Unhand that degenerate - you adolescent ass
                   of a one balled donkey!

                                     LEATHER
                   It's just a bum...You know, there's
                   enough in here for the two of you.

                                     PARRY
                             (a la Glinda)
                   Ha, ha, ha, ha rubbish...now begone...before
                   somebody drops a house on you!...

        LEATHER walks right up to PARRY.

                                     LEATHER
                   You a fag too?

                                     PARRY
                   <u>Fag..a</u> <u>fag</u> <u>you</u> <u>say!?</u>...
                   <u>"Curst</u> <u>wolf!</u> <u>Thy</u> <u>fury</u> <u>inward</u> <u>on</u> <u>thyself</u>
                   <u>Pray</u> <u>and</u> <u>consume</u> <u>thee!"</u>

                                     LEATHER
                   Fuck you.

        PARRY notices a pimple on LEATHER'S cheek.

                                     PARRY
                   Oooo...that looks like it hurts.

        HE presses the zit.

                                     LEATHER
                   OWWW....What are you nuts?!

                                     PARRY
                   BINGO! Tell the man what he's won!

        WINDBREAKER grabs PARRY, pinning his arms behind him.
        WINDBREAKER laughs. PARRY just turns his head and stares into
        his eyes, causing WINDBREAKER to feel weird.

                                     PARRY
                   I advise you to let us go.

                                     LEATHER
                   You advise us!

                                     PARRY
                   You're out numbered son.

        PARRY glances over LEATHER's shoulder. LEATHER TURNS to see:
        A BUM pushing a shopping cart comes out of the darkness. HE
        is mumbling to himself incoherently. Another BUM, appears from
        the dark, unnerving WINDBREAKER. PARRY looks to a third
        BUM, stepping out of the dark, menacingly.

        Taken by themselves, the BUMS would look harmless and pathetic.
        But in the context of their uncharacteristic organization -
        THEY appear frightening.

        LEATHER and WINDBREAKER automatically whip out switchblades
        and take a "rumble" stance - as if protecting their
        catch, Jack. Jack sort of sides with them if for no other
        reason than - he's known them longer.

        LEATHER tries to remain confident. HE laughs.

                                     LEATHER
                   Come on! Go for it!
                   What the hell are they gonna do?
                   They can't do nothin!

                                     PARRY
                   <u>Nothing!</u> <u>They</u> <u>can</u> <u>do</u> <u>nothing!</u>
                   <u>Gentlemen!</u>

        PARRY takes a few steps back and raises his hand.

        JACK stands close to LEATHER and WINDBREAKER, who prepare
        themselves for attack.

        PARRY lowers his hand which acts as a signal for the BUMS.
        The BUMS reach into their coats and each pull out a FLASHLIGHT,
        which they shine at each other as THEY SING:

                                     THREE BUMS
                   I like New York in June...How about you?
                   I like a Gershwin tune...How about you?

        JACK, LEATHER and WINDBREAKER are at a loss. The BUMS aren't
        getting all the words, but they're definitely in sync.

        PARRY lowers his hand proudly. The BUMS keep singing and turn
        their flashlights upon JACK, LEATHER and WINDBREAKER - blinding
        them to PARRY.

                                     WINDBREAKER
                   Shit.

        LEATHER brandishes his knife towards the dark spot where he
        thinks PARRY stands. But PARRY takes a flying step back.
        As he speaks, the Bums stop singing and <u>hum</u> the song.

                                     PARRY
                   Son...There comes a time in
                   every man's life...and you will
                   learn this, if and when you become men...

        From his hat, PARRY pulls a long tube sock tied at the
        end and filled with a softball at the bottom...

                                     PARRY
                   ....That there are only three things in
                   this world ya need...

        HE begins to swing the sock over his head - centrifugally
        gaining force.

                                     PARRY
                   ...Respect for all kinds of life,
                   ....the love of one other person who
                   you can trust and pork on a regular basis
                   ...and a nice navy blazer...Oh, and one
                   more thing....always... keep your eye....
                   on the ball!

        PARRY releases the "weapon".

        The sock flies out of the darkness and, with amazing
        accuracy - beans LEATHER on the forehead between his eyes. HE
        drops his knife to rub his head. HE sinks out of camera:

                                     LEATHER
                   Ow...Ow....OW!

        WINDBREAKER grows worried as PARRY reaches in to the lining
        of his coat, pulls out another "sock weapon" and starts swinging.

                                     PARRY
                   However, the ability to bean
                   a shithead can be a fabulous advantage.

        WINDBREAKER runs to the car and drives away.
        PARRY crosses to a speechless JACK.

                                     PARRY
                      (picking up LEATHER'S knife)
                   Are you all right?

                                     LEATHER
                      (kneeling, rubbing his head)
                   OWW...MAN...

                                     JACK
                      (disoriented)
                   Please don't hurt me?

                                     PARRY
                   "OH beings blind! What ignorance besets you!

        PARRY kneels down, pulls out some rope from his coat and proceeds
        to tie up LEATHER, who is disoriented and dazed. PARRY hands
        JACK LEATHER'S knife. Sickened by it, JACK flings it in the water.

                                     LEATHER
                   You can't leave me tied up out here
                   alone, you fucking faggot!

                                     PARRY
                      (PULLS DOWN LEATHERS PANTS, EXPOSING HIS BUTT)
                   You won't be alone for long.

        PARRY pulls out a triangle and begins ringing it.

                                     JACK
                   I need a drink.

                                     PARRY
                   I know a great place.
                       (Raising his hand HE calls to BUM 1:)
                   ...UH...WARREN!

                                     BUMS (O.C.)
                   I like New York in June...How about-....

                                     PARRY
                      (overlapping)
                   NO..GUYS...GUYS....
                      (to JACK)
                   They're so proud.

                                                     CUT TO:


        EXT. A LOT BENEATH THE MANHATTAN BRIDGE - NIGHT.

        A violent explosion between warring factions of bums, who
        are defending territories and rights....

                                                     CUT TO:

        Jack and Parry sit facing the three Bums from the  previous
        scene - A Black, A middle-aged Irishman and an Ex-Hippy -
        and the Pinnochio Doll.  The Foursome sit against the giant
        base of the bridge discussing the issues of the day as they pass
        a bottle. OTHER BUM CLIQUES are scattered throughout the lot.

                                     BLACK
                   ...There ain't no justice in life! There's
                   just satisfaction. And the death
                   penalty's just another violation of my
                   constitutional right to satisfaction Goddamn it.

                                     IRISHMAN
                      (a lit cigarette hangs from his mouth)
                   I hate that.

                                     HIPPIE
                   So, you mean if somebody like, killed
                   your mother, you wouldn't want him dead?

                                     BLACK
                   Sure I would. But I should get to kill him Goddamn it.

                                     IRISHMAN
                      (explaining further)
                   He gets to kill him.  That's democracy, see.

        A LULL takes over as they all consider this.
        JACK sitting the furthest apart from the group, looks like he's
        in the middle of a nightmare.

                                     JACK
                     (mumbles to himself)
                   This is it. I'm in hell. Damned to
                   an eternity of idiotic conversation.

                                     PARRY
                      (leans in and smiles)
                   Great place huh?

        The Irishman lets out a bloodcurtling scream:

                                     PARRY
                      (responds)
                   AAAAHHHH!

        JACK jumps. Irishman looks to PARRY &amp; speaks in calm monotone:

                                     IRISHMAN
                   How are you tonight?

                                     PARRY
                   Fine John and you?

                                     IRISHMAN
                   Can't complain.

        The IRISHMAN absent mindedly flicks his cigarette ashes onto
        JACK'S SLEEVE, which is soaked with gasoline. The SLEEVE IGNITES
        JACK panics - waving his is arm, trying to get it out.
        PARRY is both amazed and impressed - seeing it as a sign.
        The bums talk casually as JACK tries to rip off his coat.

                                     BLACK
                   Crazy fuck.

                                     HIPPY
                      (to IRISHMAN)
                   So what do you think of the death penalty?

                                     IRISHMAN
                   Death's definitely a penalty. Ain't
                   no fucking gift.  Life's too goddamn short.

        With the fire out, JACK tries to leave, saying:

                                     JACK
                   I better be going...

                                     IRISHMAN
                      (thrusting the bottle at him)
                   Have a drink...don't be shy!
                      (JACK sits quickly)

                                     PARRY
                   I think they like you.

        This worries Jack. PARRY retrieves him and brings him back
        to the group.

        The IRISHMAN removes the bottle from his saliva soaked mouth and
        hands it to JACK, who is disgusted:

                                     JACK
                   Oh no that's all-

                                     BLACK
                   DRINK! GODDAMN IT!

        JACK grabs the bottle and drinks - holding back his nausea.

                                     PARRY
                   Would anyone like a fruit pie?

                                     THREE BUMS (O.C.)
                   No thank you...Too sweet...to fattening...Goddamn it.

        JACK feels sick as the cheap liquor running through him.
        IRISHMAN begins reciting a Chaucer passage in old English.
        The BLACK stares off, half listening. PARRY turns to JACK,
        his face beaming, he clasps his hands and says:

                                     PARRY
                   Et in arcadia ego.

                                     HIPPY
                   Man...Why did God invent mediocrity?

        This remark acts like a slap in the face to JACK. The others
        consider it in silence - not really knowing what it means.
        The cheap liquor begins to take it's effect and from JACK'S POV,
        WE FADE OUT OF THE SCENE ON THE NEXT LINES - AS HE CLOSE HIS EYES
        AND SLIPS INTO A DRUNKEN SLUMBER.

                                     HIPPIE (O.C.)
                   You were phenominal tonight, Parry.
                      (affirmations from the other two)
                   SUPER-BUM, man! Fucking Marvel Comics...

                                                     FADE-OUT.

        FADE-UP ON:

        INT. PARRY'S BASEMENT HIDEAWAY - MORNING.

        JACK is asleep on a mattress beside a boiler spewing steam.
        HE is slowly awakened by water dripping on his cheek - -
        - the first dull pangs of a mean hangover making itself known.

        HE opens his eyes, confused -- not knowing exactly what
        happened.

                                                   CUT TO:

        THE GIANT FACE OF PARRY

        lying parallel beside him -- like a kid waiting for his
        parents to wake up Xmas morning.

                                PARRY
                         (loud and cheery)
                  How are you feeling?

        Jarred, Jack nods suspiciously.  He notices the
        surroundings --

                                JACK
                  Have I died?

                                PARRY
                         (friendly)
                  Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet...
                  Hahahaha...

                                JACK
                         (his head throbbing)
                  If you're going to murder me, that's
                  fine... just don't laugh.

        He tries to focus his eyes and looks around the room:
        there is an extremely organized "living area" -- a make-
        shift kitchen with hot plate, a nail in a wall with
        clothes on hangers... There is also a dumpster sitting
        beneath a garbage chute -- The dumpster has planets and
        stars painted on its side.

        Jack looks to the far wall and sees a handmade collage
        mural:  pictures cut out and pasted in a haphazard
        manner, all medieval in origin; grassy landscape with
        castles, knights and maidens on horses, crests and
        symbols of the Crusades, and various renditions of the
        Holy Grail... One maiden stands out from the rest -- a
        frail looking doe-like creature.

        On the adjacent wall, however, there are no pictures.
        Only frantic scribblings in red marker... Out of the
        scribblings we can see:  an evil looking face with a bear
        amateurishly drawn... a large red horse drawn as if it
        hurt to get out the image... the style is violent and
        erratic.

        Jack looks to the other wall and finds Parry's arsenal
        -- homemade "weapons" that also look medieval, like
        lances made from mop sticks, nets made of knotted rope,
        slingshots and a shield made from a garbage can cover
        with a rose painted on it.  Against each wall are piled,
        what seems to be hundreds of books.  Jack doesn't know
        what to make of all this.  He is frightened.

                                JACK
                  Where am I?

                                PARRY
                  My abode... My domicile... My neck of
                  the woods... Hungry?  Breakfast?  A
                  fruit pie perhaps?

                                JACK
                  No... thanks... Listen --

                                PARRY
                  My name is Parry.

                                JACK
                         (realizes he's barefoot)
                  Hi... Where are my shoes?

                                PARRY
                  They're --
                         (suddenly stands)
                  -- What?

                                JACK
                         (jumps)
                  Where -- ?

                                PARRY
                         (to the air)
                  <u>What</u>!?

                                JACK
                  <u>What</u>?!

                                PARRY
                  Sshhhh!

        Parry looks like he's listening to someone.  Then he
        smiles broadly at Jack, which makes Jack worry even more.

                                PARRY
                         (continuing; to the
                          air)
                  I knew it!  I knew it last night!
                         (beat; argues)
                  I did too!  He's the one!

        He kneels beside Jack, which makes Jack lean up against
        the boiler.

                                PARRY
                         (continuing)
                  ... Can you keep a secret?

        Jack shakes his head.

                                PARRY
                         (continuing)
                  Do you know what the Little People
                  just told me?

                                JACK
                  The Little People?

                                PARRY
                  They said you're The One.

                                JACK
                  I'm the one what?

                                PARRY
                         (stands abruptly)
                  <u>Oh shut up</u>!!!

        He picks up a can of wintergreen air freshener and starts
        spraying, with violent strokes, to shut "them" up... Jack
        gets more nauseous from the smell... Parry yells to the
        air:

                                PARRY
                         (continuing)
                  ... I've got a right to say
                  something.  I mean, you're tying my
                  hands here!
                         (to Jack)
                  They say you're not ready to know.

                                JACK
                  I'm not...
                         (to himself)
                  Now, where are those shoes...

        Jack makes a move to stand when Parry stops spraying and
        yells:

                                PARRY
                  <u>Hheeyy</u>!!

        Jack sits back down.  Parry whispers to the air:

                                PARRY
                         (continuing)
                  ... You're frightening him!

        Parry kneels before him.  Jack presses against the
        boiler.

                                PARRY
                         (continuing)
                  ... Do you know who I am?

                                JACK
                  Uhh... I'm drawing a blank.

                                PARRY
                  Take a guess...
                         (shouts to the air)
                  <u>Let him guess</u>!!  <u>Tch</u>.

        He goes for the air freshener but Jack's reply stops him.

                                JACK
                  Uh... gee... well... you seem to be
                  some kind of vigilante...

                                PARRY
                  No, no... I mean that sort of happens
                  along the way but no...
                         (proudly)
                  I'm on a very special quest.

                                JACK
                  A quest?

                                PARRY
                  But I need help and <u>they</u> sent you.

                                JACK
                         (clarifying)
                  The Little...

                                PARRY
                  They work for Him.

                                JACK
                  Him...?

                                PARRY
                         (leans in to whisper)
                  God... I'm the janitor of God.

        Jack's face drops.  Parry gets comfortable and explains
        casually:

                                PARRY
                         (continuing)
                  ... <u>They</u> came to me about a year ago.
                  I was sitting on the john having one
                  of the most satisfying bowel
                  movements -- you know the ones --
                  where you just see God... And I saw
                  them... just floating around...
                  hundreds of these... cute little fat
                  people... And they spoke.  They said
                  "I" was chosen to help them get back
                  something very important they lost.
                  But my part might be very dangerous.
                  I said "Whoah".... slow down... ya
                  start hearing voices from floating
                  little fat people that tell you
                  you're on a mission for God and you
                  wind up in a mini-series.  Then <u>they</u>
                  said "Look in Architecture Today, Feb
                  '88... page 33..."

        Parry quickly crosses to a pile of magazines, grabs one
        and dives back to Jack, who keeps scanning for his shoes.
        Parry leafs through the magazine and opens to page 33.

                                PARRY
                         (continuing)
                  And there it was... plain as day.

        He shows Jack a feature about Langdon Carmichael, a
        Malcolm Forbes type real estate baron.  The five page
        pictorial depicts his ten million dollar restoration of
        an old N.Y. Armory into a palatial city home.  Caption
        reads:  "REAL ESTATE BILLIONAIRE LANGDON CARMICHAEL'S
        TOWER OF POWER"...

                                JACK
                  Langdon Carmichael?

        Carmichael himself -- a dashing bachelor around fifty-
        five -- is shown standing in his private library beside a
        glass commode.  Parry points to inside the commode, where
        a golden chalice is displayed.

                                PARRY
                  It's the Grail... The Holy Grail.

        He indicates the pictures on the collage.  Jack's losing
        it.

                                JACK
                  The Holy Grail?  Some billionaire has
                  the Holy Grail sitting in a commode
                  on Madison Avenue?

                                PARRY
                  I know!  You can't imagine how
                  surprised I was.  Who would think you
                  could find anything divine on the
                  Upper East Side.

                                JACK
                         (annoyed now)
                  Listen... I don't mean to be flippant
                  or to enrage you or anything but...
                  you're an imbecile.  And I'm not The
                  One... I'm not <u>any</u> One...

        Parry tries to speak but:

                                JACK
                         (continuing)
                  I think you're a very nice... very
                  nice psychotic man.  I really
                  appreciate what you did for me.  It
                  was a very brave and noble thing...

                                PARRY
                  Oh, please... you're embarrassing me.

                                JACK
                         (rising)
                  I wish you all the luck in the world.
                  When you get the Grail, I'm sure I'll
                  be seeing lots of you on various talk
                  shows...

                                PARRY
                         (upset)
                  But I can't get it... He's...

        He runs to the wall with the scribblings in red and
        indicates the evil face with the beard... He picks up a
        red marker and begins scribbling furiously -- adding to
        the face and the horse...

                                PARRY
                         (continuing)
                  He's out there... I don't know if...
                  He's always out there, see... and...

        He drops the marker and smiles to Jack...

                                PARRY
                         (continuing)
                  See, you don't know him... That's why
                  you're the one... You can get it...

                                JACK
                  Listen, forget the shoes.  I'll just
                  take a cab... Uh...

                                PARRY
                  Parry.

                                JACK
                  Parry... I'm Jack.

                                PARRY
                  I know...

        Parry rushes to a corner and gets Jack's shows and
        Pinnochio doll, then rushes to Jack and hands them over.

                                JACK
                  Thanks... You can keep the doll.

                                PARRY
                  Thanks a mill --
                         (like a corporate exec)
                  And I'll give you a buzz as soon as I
                  hear from the people upstairs and
                  we'll get this thing off the
                  ground... Thanks for stopping by,
                  Jack.  Give my love to the wife and
                  kids.

        Parry grabs Jack's hand and shakes it.

                                JACK
                  I'm not married.

                                PARRY
                  Funny -- you look married.

        Horrified, Jack makes a hasty exit.

                                                   CUT TO:

        INT. BROWNSTONE HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

        Jack steps out of what appears to be the entrance to the
        basement.  He walks down the hallway toward the front
        exit when suddenly an apartment door swings open.  FRANK,
        a burly black superintendent with a hearing aid, steps 
        out.

                                FRANK
                  Where you comin' from?!

                                JACK
                  Uh... basement I think...

                                FRANK
                         (yells to basement)
                  <u>I tell him no visitors</u>!!!

        Jack's hangover sets off another explosion.

                                JACK
                  Sorry... I...

                                WIFE (O.S.)
                  <u>Fraaaaankkk</u>!  <u>Who's at the door</u>?!

        Jack glances through the half-opened door and sees the
        bottom half of Frank's wheelchair bound WIFE:  one leg is
        normal, the other is a pink prosthetic.  Both, however,
        are wearing furry mules.  Jack's nightmare doesn't seem
        to end.

                                FRANK
                  <u>I'm talkin' to somebody</u>.  <u>Ya gotta</u>
                  <u>yell like a banshee</u>?!!

                                WIFE (O.S.)
                  It's just my manner!

                                FRANK
                         (hard of hearing)
                  <u>What</u>?

                                WIFE (O.S.)
                  <u>I said it's just my manner</u>!!!

        Jack's head is now nearly split down the middle.

                                FRANK
                  You a friend of Parry's?

                                JACK
                  No...
                         (trying to clear his
                          vision)
                  He is supposed to live there?

                                FRANK
                  Yeah, well... I let him stay there.
                  What else could I do after such a
                  tragedy?

                                JACK
                  Tragedy?

                                  FRANK
                            (dying to tell)
                  He and his wife was were at some bar
                  ..and some nut came in with a shotgun
                  and blew the place apart. She was a beautiful
                  girl...She never knew what hit her.

          Jack goes numb. He can't believe his ears. HE leans

          LIGHT CHANGE on Jack against the bare wall. (Perhaps even
          the scenery is moved behind him) as we fade out Frank's voice.

                  ..Listen. I understand about open
                  relationships. Please. I was a teenager
                  in the sixties after all....I understand!

        INT. VIDEO POP OFFICE - DAY.

        Anne sits at her desk, surrounded by her shelves of porno
        tapes. Jack sits before her looking like death warmed over.
        Frank's voice reverbs in his head as he half listens to Anne.

                                     ANNE
                   ....But when you care about somebody
                   ya need more than an open relationship.
                   Ya need a phone call.

        Her intercom RINGS. Anne's tone immediately changes:

                                     ANNE
                              (continuing)
                   WHAT!....

                                EMPLOYEE (V.O.)
                  A guy wants to check out the
                  pornos...

                                ANNE
                  So send him back!
                         (she flicks off the
                          intercom and returns
                          to Jack, softly)
                  ... Ya need to pick up the phone and
                  tell me that you're not dead... that
                  you haven't been attacked or raped or
                  who knows.  You disappear last night.
                  I don't know what to think.  I was up
                  all night.  Look at you!

        A meek, fiftyish BUSINESSMAN has entered and begins to
        browse through the porno videos discreetly.

                                JACK
                  I'm sorry.

                                ANNE
                  I smell gas... Do you smell gas...

        She and the Businessman exchange glances.  Jack is about
        to respond when Anne continues:

                                ANNE
                         (continuing)
                  I can't tell you how distraught I
                  was.  All night long.  What the hell
                  happened?

                                JACK
                  I was attacked.

                                ANNE
                  <u>What</u>!

                                JACK
                  Two kids tried to set me on fire.

                                ANNE
                  <u>Oh my God</u>... <u>What did they do</u>!  <u>My</u>
                  <u>God</u>!!!

        She crosses to Jack and hugs him... The Businessman turns
        with a concerned look, having overheard.  Jack indicates
        to Anne that he feels awkward in front of the
        Businessman.  Anne confronts the Businessman with as
        little tact as possible.

                                ANNE
                         (continuing)
                  Are you almost done?!

                                BUSINESSMAN
                         (flustered)
                  Well...

                                ANNE
                  Whatta looking for -- a story!?
                         (makes a selection)
                  Here... "Creamer Versus Creamer"...
                  It won an award.

        Jack hides his face so as not to laugh.  Anne ushers the
        man out.

                                ANNE
                         (continuing)
                  You were attacked.  My God.  Should I
                  call a doctor!  Did you call the
                  police...

                                JACK
                  No, I'm fine... really...

                                ANNE
                  You're all right... you sure...

        Jack nods.  So, Anne moves on to more important matters.

                                ANNE
                         (continuing)
                  ... So... where did you sleep last
                  night?

                                JACK
                  I... I stayed at a friend's.  Listen,
                  I --

                                ANNE
                         (puts up her hand)
                  Please... before you go on... let me
                  tawk... okay... We've had a wonderful
                  time together... When we first met,
                  you said this wasn't serious and I
                  shouldn't get serious and then you
                  moved in and we haven't been serious.
                  And I just wanna say that I have no
                  regrets.  None.  And don't wanna have
                  any now so I want ya to be up front
                  with me... I want the truth.
                  If you're seein' somebody else, let
                  me know... You don't have to pour
                  gasoline on yourself and light a
                  match just to break up with me.  Just
                  tell me the truth.

        Jack looks to her -- somewhat admiring the bravery and
        integrity underneath the peasant stock.

                                JACK
                  I'm not seeing anyone else.  I really
                  was attacked.

                                ANNE
                  Okay.
                         (satisfied, she struts
                          to her desk)
                  ... I love you...

        Jack smiles weakly.

                                ANNE
                         (continuing)
                  ... You don't have to say it back...
                  although it wouldn't kill you.  I'll
                  cook tonight.

        INT. ANNE'S APARTMENT ABOVE THE STORE - NIGHT

        Anne and Jack have just finished eating dinner.

                                JACK
                  You know what the Holy Grail is?

        Anne takes a long drag then puts it out in her leftover
        food.  Jack is repelled by the habit.

                                ANNE
                  The Holy Grail?  Yeah... I know that.
                  It was like -- Jesus' juice glass.

        Jack just stares at her.

                                ANNE
                         (continuing)
                  Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.

                                JACK
                  You still believe in God?

                                ANNE
                  Oh sure... Gotta believe in God.
                         (trying to be 
                          intellectual)
                  But I don't think God made man in his
                  own image.  No.  'Cause most of...
                  the bullshit that happens, is because
                  of men.  No, I think man was made out
                  of the devil's image and women were
                  created out of God -- because women
                  can have babies which is sorta like
                  creating, and which also explains why
                  women are attracted to men, because,
                  lets face it, the devil is a helluva
                  lot more interesting -- I slept with
                  a few saints and let me tell you...
                  <u>Booooorring</u>!!!... And so the whole
                  point of life, I think, is for men
                  and women to get married so the devil
                  and God can live together and, ya
                  know -- work it out...
                         (Anne moves to him and
                          leans in for a kiss)
                  ... Not that we have to get married.

        Jack notices a brown spot on her chin and pulls away.

                                JACK
                  ... You have a little... uh...
                  something on your face...

                                ANNE
                  Oh, I got a pimple... This stuff is
                  supposed to blend with my skin
                  color... Like it really works, ya
                  know...

        Jack moves to the bar to fix a drink.  Anne follows him
        and takes the drink out of his hand.  Jack knows what
        this means.

                                JACK
                  I don't think I'm up to it tonight...

        Anne massages his shoulders.

                                JACK
                  I had a very traumatic experience...
                  I...

        Anne nods but keeps massaging.  As long as he wasn't with
        a woman, she doesn't care.  Her massaging gets more
        intense -- moving up his head and contorting his face as
        he speaks.

                                JACK
                         (continuing)
                  I think I'm getting sick...
                         (trying to be
                          forceful)
                  I... I slept in a boiler room,
                  Anne... I'm tired... I'm upset...
                  I'm... just not in the mood!... Okay!

        Anne grabs his face with both hands and pulls him into a
        kiss.  She proceeds to climb onto his body as she
        utilizes a skill she picked up in high school make-out
        parties.  She is a pro.  Jack, against all his better
        judgement and will -- despite the pimple cream -- is
        rendered helpless by this woman's passion... He returns
        the embrace and guides her to the floor.

        INT. ANNE'S LIVING ROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

        Jack sits in his underwear on the living room floor
        before an open closet with a cardboard box between his
        legs.  The box is filled with tapes of Jack's past radio
        shows.  He begins to sort through them... reading titles,
        remembering moments... then stops when he comes upon
        newspaper clippings of the murder at Babbitt's.  Edwin
        Malnick's face stares at him from a yellowed front page.
        The memories sour.  He moves to the bar.  Anne exits the
        bedroom.

                                ANNE
                  Whatsa matter, hon -- can't sleep?

        She sees the radio tapes.

                                JACK
                  I tell you something, Anne.  I really
                  feel like I'm cursed.

                                ANNE
                  Oh stop.  Things will change.  My
                  Aunt Mary always said, there's a
                  remedy for everything in this world
                  except death and having no class.

                                JACK
                  I get this feeling like I'm... a
                  magnet but I attract shit.  Out of
                  all the people in this city, why did
                  I meet a man who's wife I killed?

                                ANNE
                  You didn't kill anybody.  Stop.

                                JACK
                  I wish there was some way I could...
                  just... pay the fine and go home.

        Anne crosses to Jack and gently touches him.  Jack turns
        and clutches her to him tightly.  Lowering his head to
        hers, he cries...

                                ANNE
                  I know.  I know, honey.

        INT. PARRY'S BASEMENT - THE NEXT DAY

        Jack is alone in the basement.  He slowly walks around
        the room -- picking up little items here and there, as if
        trying to discover some clue to Parry.  He scans the
        titles of the piles of books.  All of them have something
        to do with medieval history or literature, myths, or the
        Crusades... He picks up one of the books and opens it...
        Page after page has been ripped out anywhere there might
        have been a picture or a diagram.  He comes upon a large
        scroll that he unravels.  It is a map, drawn by Parry, of
        Langdon Carmichael's house and the surrounding blocks...
        He rolls it up... The Pinnochio doll sits on a broken
        chair facing the wall with the nightmarish scribblings...
        acting like a sentinel.

        He crosses to the prominent picture of the maiden with
        the long hair.  He notices a small stand before the
        picture, with a candle.  It is like a shrine with
        offerings:  a flower, a small perfume sampler, a box of
        Jawbreakers candy and a dime store romance novel.  Jack
        doesn't understand.

                                FRANK (O.S.)
                  Can I help you?

                                JACK
                  I'm... just looking for Parry...

                                FRANK
                  He's not here.

        Jack is drawn to the scribblings on the wall and makes
        out the faint shape of a man on a horse.

                                JACK
                  What did you say his name used to be?

        CLOSEUP - duffel bag of Parry's things before Jack.

                  Hospital said it would be better if
                  we kept certain things away from him.

        Frank speaks O.S. as Jack looks through the items:  ... a
        Master's degree in Medieval History... Another in
        Medieval Literature...

                  Columbia.  They kept him in some
                  mental place on Staten Island... He
                  did not speak for over a year then
                  all of a sudden, he starts talkin'

                  ... He used to live upstairs with his
                  wife, so when he got released they
                  sent him here.  I felt bad.  He
                  couldn't work.  Nobody wanted him.
                  So I let him stay in the basement.
                  He helps out -- I give him a couple
                  of dollars.  People throw things away
                  he gets them.

        wife:

        EXT. A LOT BENEATH THE MANHATTAN BRIDGE - DAY.

        The BLACK, the IRISHMAN and the HIPPY are in their usual
        place. THEY lean against the wall, observing the afternoon
        life that walks by. JACK enters the scene and asks them where
        PARRY is. The HIPPY begins to speak and points to his right.
        JACK nods in appreciation and hands them a couple of dollars.

        EXT. CORNER OUTSIDE METROPOLITAN LIFE BUILDING-LATER THAT DAY.

        JACK approaches PARRY from across the street; he is sitting on
        top of a car near a souvlaki vendor and eyeing A CLOCK TOWER
        across the street and to the left of the building. HE studies
        the time as he recites under his breath (we only hear excerpts);

                                     PARRY
                   "Soveriegn princess of his captive heart
                   what dire affliction has thou made me
                   suffer, thus banished from thy presence
                   with reproach, and fettered by thy rigorous
                   command, not to appear again before thy
                   beautiful face. Deign princess, to remember
                   this thy faithful slave, who now endures
                   such misery for love of thee"....

                                     JACK
                   Parry!

        PARRY smiles casually and, without looking at Jack, says:

                                     PARRY
                   Hi Jack...

        HE then returns his gaze to the clock which is approaching NOON.
        JACK reaches in his pockets and pulls out some money.

                                     JACK
                   Hi. Listen...I thought maybe you could use a-

        THE CLOCK STRIKES NOON. PARRY grabs JACK...

                                     PARRY
                   COME ON!

        HE pulls JACK into the building.

        EXT. MET LIFE BUILDING - NOON.

        Several business men and women make their way out the
        elevators for lunch. PARRY and JACK position themselves
        with a clear view of the center elevator. The doors open
        and after several more aggressive co-workers exit, PARRY'S
        DAMSEL in distress appears out of a revolving door, but
        quickly gets "revolved" back into the building....

                                     PARRY
                   She'll be back....

        Finally, Lydia makes an exit.

                                     PARRY
                   Isn't she a vision?

        REACTION SHOT OF A BEWILDERED JACK as he looks at
        LYDIA - a dowdy, waif-like sparrow of a thing -  makes her
        way through the lobby. SHE is torturously self-conscious,
        clumsy, formless and plain. She wears loose frocks that give
        her no shape and make her appear to be swimming in material.
        SHE wears no make-up; her unstyled hair is kept off her face
        by a single beret that keeps sliding down her head, and her
        contact lens are always dry, causing her to blink and use drops.

                                     JACK
                   Yeah, gorgeous...Look, I'm going.
                   I just wanted to give you...

        Starts to dig in his pocket, but Parry is already off.

                                     PARRY
                   Let's go.

        JACK follows.

        EXT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - DAY.

        Behind the glass in interior, we can see LYDIA sitting by herself
        eating lunch. CAMERA PANS OUT TO THE STREET where PARRY
        and JACK are sitting on the hood of a car, watching...

                                     PARRY
                   She loves dumplings.  It's her
                   Wednesday ritual.

        LYDIA raises a dumpling to her lips with a pair of chopsticks.
        SHE then accidentally drops it into a dish of soy sauce and
        splatters her dress.  Unnerved, she hastily wipes herself down,
        knocking over a glass of water when she removes the napkin.

                                     PARRY
                   Isn't she sweet. She does that every time...

        Jack squints at Lydia as if trying to see what Parry
        sees.

        INT. BOOKSTAND NEAR GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY

        Jack and Parry have followed Lydia into a bookstore.  She
        stands browsing through a revolving bookstand.  They
        watch from a distance.

                                 PARRY
                   She buys a new book every two days.

        Lydia spins too hard, sending books flying off.  She
        replaces the books, but keeps one called "Loves Lusty
        Longings"...

                                 PARRY
                          (continuing; smiles with
                           great affection)
                   She's into trash.  Whadda you gonna
                   do?

        EXT. MET LIFE BUILDING - DAY

        Parry and Jack are following Lydia, when she stops at a
        newsstand.

                                 PARRY
                   She's got a real sweet tooth.  If
                   anybody ever told me I'd be in love
                   with a woman who eats Jawbreakers,
                   I'd said they were nuts.
                          (reverentially)
                   But look at that jaw!

        Jack doesn't want to look.  If the Little People made
        Parry seem crazy, this infatuation confirms him as beyond
        hope.

        EXT. MET LIFE BUILDING - DAY

        Lydia buys some candy then turns and walks back toward
        her office building, once again waiting her turn to dive
        into the revolving doors.  She disappears into the
        building.

                                     JACK
                   Do you follow her every day?

                                     PARRY
                   Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.

                                     JACK
                   What's her name?

                                     PARRY
                   I don't know.

        A businessman, walking in the opposite direction, throws a
        candy wrapper on the street as he passes Jack and Parry.
        Parry suddenly stops, outraged, pulls out a slingshot and
        fires a stone at the man's head.  The businessman is hit
        but doesn't know how, since Parry grabs Jack's arm and
        resumes walking casually in the opposite direction.

                                     JACK
                   Why did you do that?

                                     PARRY
                   Well, if every time someone did
                   something offensive they hit in the
                   head with a pebble, I think
                   they might alter their behavior.
                   What do you think Jack...

        Before Jack can respond, PARRY spots a rummage find:

                                     PARRY
                   Oh look! A cooler!

        Parry spots an abandoned COOLER filled with junk and starts
        going through it. Things are getting weird again, so JACK
        seizes the moment to accomplish his initial task - he pulls
        out a fifty dollar bill and hands it to PARRY.

                                     JACK
                   Here...I just would like to help
                   you. I thought...maybe...you
                   could use some money.

                                     PARRY
                   Fifty dollars?

        JACK digs deeper and hands him a twenty. PARRY is dumbfounded.

                                     JACK
                   Here's another twenty. Will that do?
                      (sorting through his change)
                   I mean, what's it going to take!

                                     PARRY
                   No..no, it's..I don't know what to say.
                   This is so nice of you...Jack...

        HE hugs him on the street which embarasses JACK to no end.

                                     JACK
                      (pulling away)
                   That's O.K.

                                     PARRY
                   Can I take you to lunch?

                                     JACK
                   No..I have to get back to work.
                   Take care of yourself.

        JACK walks away. CAMERA stays on JACK for a few yards until he
        turns around and sees:

        PARRY handing the money to a BUM in a doorway, yelling into
        an imaginary phone.

                                     BUM
                   SELL!....SELL!....SELL!
                           (HE takes the money
                             from PARRY)
                   BUY!...BUY!...BUY!...

                                     JACK
                   HEY!!...HEY!

        JACK walks back to PARRY, who is explaining to the BUM, who is
        now talking gibberish:

                                     PARRY
                       (as if he understands)
                   Well, I think you should be realistic.
                   Ya can't start an ad agency on fifty dollars!

                                     JACK
                   What are you doing?
                      (to BUM)
                   Give that back!

        The Bum screams in defiance... PARRY pulls JACK away...

                                     JACK
                   But I gave it to you!

                                     PARRY
                   Well what am I gonna do with it?

                                     JACK
                   I don't know. But I gave it to
                   you...to help YOU...not him.

                                     PARRY
                      (beat, then smiles mischieviously)
                   You really want to help me?

        A wary JACK, who's afraid to reply.

                   Pretty impressive huh?...Don't let it scare you.
                   I'll admit it's formidable but
                   everything has it's weakness.

                                     JACK
                   You can't just break into Langdon
                   Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.

                                     PARRY
                   O.K...let me explain this one more
                   time...The Holly Grail is in -....

                                     JACK
                   All right! Listen - please...don't
                   start drooling or...rolling your eyes
                   when I tell you this but - You shouldn't
                   do this..There is no Holy Grail.

                                     PARRY
                   Of course there is, Jack. What do you
                   think the Crusades were - a frat initiation?
                   I don't think so...There has to be a Grail.

                                     JACK
                   Look, you're only sort of insane, really.
                   People like you can lead semi-normal lives.
                   You could get a job...

                                     PARRY
                   I don't need a job. I have a quest.

                                     JACK
                   I take it back - you're fucking deranged...
                   And you're going to get yourself killed
                   trying to get in there!

                                     PARRY
                   Tch. You are so sweet...Now I know
                   why you're saying this.
                   ...You're afraid I'm in danger and
                   you're trying to protect me.

                                     JACK
                   No. I think you're a moron and
                   I don't want to get into trouble.

        Ignoring this, PARRY gets filled with emotion and hugs JACK.

                                     PARRY
                   ...You are such a great guy. First

                   That's why the Little People sent you.
                   Just <u>like</u> magic.

                                     JACK
                   I don't believe in little floating
                   people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!

                                     PARRY
                   So what? You going to help me?

               JACK
    WILL YOU PLEASE... please listen to me ...
         (HE GRABS PARRY by the shoulders)
    You know none of this is true -                           PARRY
    the Grail, the voices...                           Jack...
    There's a part of you that                         Come on...what are
    knows this isn't true.                             saying...
    I know who you are...                              I know who you are..
    or who you were.                                   You're acting really-
    You don't belong on the                            No, no, no, no...
    streets. You're intelligent                        Jack...
    man....you're a teacher...                         Jacck!...
    You were a teach at Hunter College.
    Don't you remember?...                               (SCREAMS)

        PARRY breaks away from him. HE falls back onto the ground.
        THE SCREAM STOPS and is replaced by an eerie SILENCE.
        As if sound were ripped out of space. JACK speaks but no
        sound comes out...We are in PARRY'S world for this brief
        moment...JACK leans over to help PARRY, but the latter inches
        away...fearful of the vision he sees: something out of sight,
        looming over JACK, breathing FIERY SMOKE...JACK tries to raise
        PARRY off the ground and, in doing so, the vision for PARRY
        comes into full view:

                                                     CUT TO:

        A MAGNIFICENT BURNISHED RED STEED

        stared down at Parry. On top of him sits the Red Knight.
        - a helmeted figure with a beard in a flowing red cap,
        holding a lance. He stares at Parry. Closing his eyes,
        Parry raises his hands to protect himself.

        Jack looks around and sees nothing. He acts with great concern:

                                     JACK
                      (Mouthing in silence)
                   Perry...you all right?

        HE embraces PARRY by the shoulders. PARRY turns to him opening
        his eyes, then turns back to the KNIGHT to discover that:
        The HORSE and the KNIGHT have moved several feet away, and
        are continuing to back up...as if in retreat.

        JACK speaks as the sound is returned.

                                     JACK
                   Parry answer me...are you all right?

        PARRY smiles in amazement.

                                 PARRY
                   He knows who you are!
                          (amazed)
                   He's afraid!  I can tell!

                                 JACK (O.S.)
                   You're totally gone, aren't you?

                                                   CUT TO:


        THE RED KNIGHT

        He pulls the reins back, forcing the horse up onto its
        hind legs.  Then, he gallops off.

                                                   CUT TO:


        PARRY AND JACK

                                 PARRY
                   <u>We've got'em... come on</u>!!!

        Parry runs O.S. in the direction of the Knight.  Jack is
        not about to follow, until he sees -- Parry runs right
        into the intersection of 94th &amp; Fifth almost getting hit
        hit by a cab.

                                 JACK
                   Jesus.

        Jack runs after him.

                                                   CUT TO:


        EXT. FIFTH AVE. AND 74TH - DAY

        Parry reaches where the Red Knight stood and looks.

                                                   CUT TO:


        THE RED KNIGHT

        riding onto the sidewalk and into Central Park.

                                                   CUT TO:


        PARRY, as JACK reaches him.

                                     JACK
                   What is going o-

        Before he can finish, PARRY is off again. JACK races after him.

                                                     CUT TO:

        EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY.

        THEY climb the wall and run into the park. THEY dodge past women
        with strollers, runners, bikers, sun worshippers, etc....
        THEY run deep into an extremely woody section of Central Park.
        The RED KNIGHT appears first to the left, then re-appears to
        the right. PARRY darts about like a madman.

        EXT. ROCK - CENTRAL PARK - DAY

        The Red Knight is perched atop a rock. He and Parry exchange
        looks. The Knight and his horse rear up, two towering figures
        against the Central Park South skyline.

        EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY.

        Parry, uttering a war cry, rushes off again.

        EXT. ROCK - CENTRAL PARK - DAY

        JACK, exhausted and bedraggled, climbs the rock to follow.
        He reaches the top, panting.

                                     JACK
                   Oh...Oh...Oh God...I'm dying.
                   I can't breath and I'm dying.

        HE finds PARRY sitting Buddha-like, on the top of the rock,
        calmly gazing out at the beautiful scenery before him.

                                     PARRY
                   Isn't it great up here...
                   He's gone now, but we had him on the run!
                   We would've had his ass if we had horses!
                   He's running scared!

                                     JACK
                   WHO! WHO'S RUNNING?!! WHO HAVE WE BEEN
                   CHASING!?? CAN I ASK THIS QUESTION NOW!!!

        CAMERA PANS BACK SLOWLY from behind Jack and Parry.

                                     PARRY
                   I'm sorry Jack. I thought you saw him.

        CAMERA reveals the head of a horse.

                                     JACK
                   SAW WHO!!?

                                     PARRY
                   The Red Knight!

                                     JACK
                   The Red...?
                       (stares at him in wonder)
                   You're totally gone, aren't you?

        Frustrated, JACK turns to leave but this time there is a sound -
        someone is crying O.S.

                                     PARRY
                   .....Do you hear that?! Oh
                   "Heaven be praised, in giving me an
                   opportunity, so soon of fulfilling the
                   duties of my profession...These cries
                   doubtless proceed from some miserable male
                   or female, who stands in need of my
                   immediate aid and protection"

        And he's off....A reluctant JACK pauses before following.

                                     JACK
                   This is too hard.

                                                     CUT TO:

        EXT. - CENTRAL PARK; BRIDLE PATH - DAY.

        The park's bridle path.  A BEATEN MAN cries as he sits in the
        middle of the dirt bridle path - mumbling to himself, trying
        to bury himself in dirt....HE hears the two men coming.

                                     GAY BUM
                   GET AWAY! GET AWAY!!....

        PARRY kneels down to him. JACK keeps a safe distance away.

                                     PARRY
                   It's O.K...It's O.K...Lets me help you up.

                                     GAY BUM
                   NO...I WANNA GO! I WANNA GO NOW!

                                     PARRY
                   Come on now...You can't sit here.

                                     GAY BUM
                   NO! I want a debutante on a horse
                   to step on me.  Leave me alone!!

                                     JACK
                      (wanting to leave)
                   Parry...

                                     PARRY
                   Buddy, the days of the debutantes
                   are ... not what they used to be.

                                     GAY BUM
                      (starts to cry)
                   Isn't that awful? Poor Brenda Frazier.
                   Poor Little Gloria. They ruined them!
                   THEY ATE THEM ALIVE!

                                     PARRY
                      (helping him up)
                   It was a crime.

                                     GAY BUM
                   Leave me alone...I wanna go...

        PARRY lifts him up - he looks to JACK for help.

                                     PARRY
                   Will you get the other side.
                      (JACK hesitates)
                   Jack?

        The man's cuts and suicidal demeanor turn JACK off.

                                     JACK
                   Listen, he just needs to sleep it
                   off. Someone will take care of him.

                                     PARRY
                   Who?

                                     JACK
                   Well, maybe he wants to stay here.
                      (to bum)
                   Do...do you want to stay here?

                                     GAY BUM
                      (suddenly lucid and pissy)
                   Oh, yes, thank you - I really love bleeding
                   in horseshit. How very Gandhiesque of you.

        PARRY looks to JACK, who then begrudgingly helps the BUM up.

                                                     CUT TO:

        INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - LATER.

        In a room at the end of the line of chairs, PARRY stands holding
        the GAY BUM. JACK stands a safe distance away, unable to
        take his eyes off the scene before him : seated against the
        wall are an assortment of derelicts, drunks, screaming withdrawl
        victims and jacketed schizophrenics. JACK has a hard time moving.

                                     PARRY
                      (to JACK, referring to GAY BUM)
                   Will you watch him for a minute?

        Before Jack can respond, PARRY shifts the GAY BUM'S body
        into JACK'S arms, then moves about the room, introducing
        himself to the various patients as JACK watches. HE moves
        down the line...saying hello, wiping people's brows,
        holding the hands of an angry bag lady mumbling incoherently.
        Smiling and saying hello to each one, no matter how frightening
        they seem.  HE appears to have a soothing affect.

                                     GAY BUM
                   I wanna go...Just let me go...

                                     JACK
                   Uh...Where...where do you want to go?

                                     GAY BUM
                      (upset)
                   A real nice place I know...
                   Ah...can't get there! Not tonight.

                                     JACK
                      (being positive)
                   Where?  Maybe we can.

                                     GAY BUM
                      (overlapping, crying)
                   No...no...we can't...we can't..

                                     JACK
                      (with more feeling)
                   Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?

                                     GAY BUM
                   Venice...Like Katherine Hepburn in SUMMERTIME.
                      (The GAY BUM cries in frustration).
                   ....Why can't I be Katherine Hepburn...

        JACK stares at him, at a complete loss for a response.

                                     GAY BUM
                   I wanna die...I just wanna die...

        JACK, against all better judgement, pats the BUM'S hand in
        comfort. Unexpectedly, the GAY BUM leans his head on JACK'S
        shoulder, and cries. JACK, wide-eyed with embarassment, looks
        over to PARRY -

                                                     CUT TO:

        INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY

        PARRY is teaching a song to a SCITZHO, A YUPPIE IN A STRAIGHT
        JACKET, and a paranoid BAG LADY...

                                     BUM
                   O.K..everyone know their parts...
                   Here we go...
                      (sings)
                   "I like New York in June"...

        HE points to the YUPPIE who replies:

                                     YUPPIE
                   "How about you..."

                                     PARRY
                   "I like a Gershwin tune..."

        PARRY points to the SCITZHO, who stares at him blankly, drooling:

                                     PARRY
                   ...Good!.... "I like to read good books"

        HE points to the BAG LADY, who is talking to herself:

                                     BAG LADY
                   Where the hell am I gonna put the
                   children? Goddamn daughter-in-law!
                   Comes into my house looking for dustballs!
                   GET THE FUCK OUTTA MY DINING ROOM...you ingrate!

                                     PARRY
                   Tempo, people...tempo...

        INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY

        JACK, his arm around the despairing GAY MAN, is sharing his
        problems.

                                     JACK
                   Can you tell me something? Did you lose
                   your mind all of a sudden or was it a
                   slow gradual process?

                                     GAY BUM
                      (suddenly coherent)
                   Well,... I'm a singer by trade...
                   Summer stock...nightclub revues...
                   that kind of thing...It used to be
                   what I absolutely lived for...God...I can do
                   GYPSY backwards - every part- but, one
                   night...in the middle of singing
                   "Funny..... - it suddenly hit me...
                   ...what does all of this really mean?
                      (JACK nods in a knowing metaphysical aggreement)
                   That, and the fact that all my friends are
                   dead...God, I sound like a veteran.
                   Dad would be so proud.

        At that moment a PIZZA BOY enters, making a delivery:

                                     PIZZA BOY
                   Pizza!

        Suddenly, DOCTORS and NURSES appear out of the wood work and
        swarm around the delivery boy.

                                                     CUT TO:

        INT. EMERGENCY ROOM- DAY

        PARRY notices the time, passing by the doctors and pizza.

                                     PARRY
                   Jack, it's almost five.  We're going to be late.
                   We're going to miss her!

        PARRY exits. JACK turns to the GAY BUM, exhaustedly.

                                     JACK
                   Um...I've got to run. I've bee doing
                   this all day.  Are you going to be all right?

                                     GAY BUM
                   Oh please!...I was born a Catholic in Brooklyn...
                   I've been to hell and back....
                   I'll be fine...
                      (adds quite sincerely:)
                   ....Thanks...You're a gem.

        JACK nods, a little self-consciously, and exits.

                                                     CUT TO:

        INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION: A BANK - RUSH HOUR

        PARRY and JACK sit on the floor enjoying a cup of coffee.
        A VIETNAM VET in a wheelchair with no legs sits near the opposite
        wall, along with at least fifteen other homeless beggers.

        Another MAN sits against a cash machine, crying. A WOMAN passes
        by and drops some change in the VET's cup without saying
        a word. The Vet, SID, smiles broadly.

                                SID
                  <u>God Bless You</u>... <u>Have a nice day</u>.
                         (to Jack and Parry)
                  Ya hear Jimmy Nickels got picked up
                  yesterday...

        Parry is too busy scanning the Grand Central main floor
        to answer.  Realizing Parry isn't answering, Jack feels
        obliged to pick up the conversation.

                                JACK
                  Oh yeah?

                                SID
                  He got caught --
                         (passer-by drops coins in
                          cup)
                  <u>God bless</u>... <u>Have a safe trip home</u>...
                          (to Jack)
                  -- Got caught pissin' on the
                  bookstore.  Man's a pig.  No excuse
                  for that.  We're heading for social
                  anarchy when people start pissing on
                  bookstores!

        Jack smiles at this observation.  He then tries to get
        Parry's attention.

                                 JACK
                  You'll never see her in this crowd.

        Parry doesn't answer.  He looks like a dog waiting for
        its master.  People walk by Jack at a frantic pace.  He
        sits uncomfortably against a wall.  A man almost steps on
        him as he walks by and tosses a coin at Sid, missing the
        cup and forcing Sid to bend over... Jack picks the coin
        up for him.

                                SID
                  Bless you.

                                JACK
                  Asshole!  Guy didn't even look at
                  you.

                                SID
                         (takes coin)
                  He's paying so he don't have to look.
                  What he doesn't know is, he's paying
                  for a service.  Guy goes to work
                  every day and for eight hours, seven
                  days a week, he bends over and gets
                  it right up the ass till he can't
                  stand...

        Parry stands up and begins pacing before the main floor.

                                SID
                         (continuing)
                  ... But one day, right before
                  quitting time on Friday, his boss is
                  going say something like "Say Bob --
                  come into my office and kiss my
                  ass"... and Bob is going think --
                  "The hell with it!  I don't care what
                  happens.  All I want right now is to
                  see the expression on his face when I
                  stab him with these pair of
                  scissors"...

        Parry looks at the clock above the information booth --
        5:00.

                                SID
                         (continuing)
                  ... But then he thinks of me -- "wait
                  a minute!"... he says... "It's not so
                  bad.  At least I got two arms and two
                  legs and I ain't beggin' for money."
                  He puts down the scissors, and
                  puckers up...

        Jack is impressed with this man.

                                SID
                         (continuing)
                  ... I'm what you call a moral traffic
                  light.  It's like I'm saying "<u>Red</u> --
                  go no further."

        O.S. a black woman begins to sing.  Jack and Sid look:

                                SID
                         (continuing; smiles with
                          respect)
                  Ah, Margaret.

                                                   CUT TO:


        INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - PHOTO LAB - RUSH HOUR

        MARGARET, a black woman in a paisley kaften, stands near
        a photo lab across from Jack and Sid.  With a box in
        front of her for donations, she starts singing (SONG to
        be chosen).  Some rush hour commuters stop to listen.
        Her VOICE is strong and soulful, she performs
        uninhibitedly.

                                SID
                  You have to admit though... Like at
                  5:00 in Grand Central... Pretty
                  breathtaking, don't cha think?

        Jack looks around this mad rush hour scene, taking it in
        through Sid's eyes... Parry, however, keeps his gaze on
        the main floor.  Suddenly, he spots her:

                                                   CUT TO:


        INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - MAIN FLOOR

        Hordes of people are moving in every which way,
        zigzagging across the floor... Lydia moves through the
        crowd, avoiding touching anyone...


        PARRY

        CAMERA PANS IN SLOWLY as we hear Margaret's SONG O.S.
        The closer the CAMERA gets to Parry the more her song
        changes... At first a blend of two melodies that sound
        distruptive, cachophonous... But as Parry smiles with
        joy, HIS SONG overtakes Margaret's... It is a WALTZ.

                                                   CUT TO:


        MAIN FLOOR - PARRY'S POV

        The hordes of people continue their zigzagging for a beat
        then:

        Suddenly, they pair up and waltz around the main floor,
        circling around the center information booth...

        Only Lydia remains walking -- gliding through the dancers
        with grace and ease...

        Parry watches in a state of rapture -- moving as she
        moves to keep her in eye view as long as possible.

                                                   CUT TO:


        JACK

        listening to Margaret's SONG, taking in the scene around
        him... watching people listen to her song, while others
        walk by as if they were deaf and blind...

        Feeling strangely at ease, strangely apart of everyone
        around him -- a group of lost souls listening to a woman
        bare her soul in song.  He looks to spot Parry, rises and
        crosses to him...

                                                   CUT TO:


        MAIN FLOOR

        Parry watches as Lydia exits the main floor (the waltz
        has ended) just as Jack speaks his line:

                                JACK
                  It's such a great song.

                                PARRY
                         (referring to his own
                          song)
                  It's a classic.

        Jack looks in the direction of Parry's stare and sees
        Lydia exit.

                                PARRY
                         (continuing)
                  God.  Just one night with her.  I'd
                  die happy.

        Jack hears this as if a light bulb went off above his
        head.

                                                   CUT TO:

        INT. LYDIA'S APARTMENT - DUSK

        A door opens.  Lydia enters with a bag of groceries she
        picked up on the way.  She turns on the light to reveal
        an extremely neat, albiet modest, one bedroom apartment.
        She carries the grocery bag into the kitchen.

        Out of the bag, she removes a Lean Cuisine, a giant
        bottle of cream soda and four giant bars of Chunky
        chocolate.  She pops the Lean Cuisine into the oven and
        walks back into the living room to an old stereo.  She
        turns the TURNTABLE on -- a record already set upon it.
        She stands by her coffee table, as if taking position:

        Suddenly, we hear ETHEL MERMAN -- as Lydia lip-syncs
        every word with complete commitment -- giving a full out
        performance.

                                ETHEL/LYDIA
                  Got no sunshine, got no rain
                  Still I think I'm a lucky dame
                  I got the sun in the morning
                  And the moon at night...

        Her attempts at hand gestures and choreography are
        awkward -- bunking into the coffee table, banging her
        hand against a lamp -- but, we see a part of Lydia that
        few (actually no one) sees.  Her abandon, her joy... her
        smile.  From upstairs, neighbors BANG for her to keep the
        music down.  Lydia casually crosses to the stereo, turns
        off the turntable and heads back to the kitchen -- as if
        the neighbors interference were all apart of her nightly
        ritual.

                                                   CUT TO:


        INT. ANNE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

        Anne sits alone at her formica table, smoking a
        cigarette.  Two plates are set.  She waits for Jack.  She
        is hurt and pissed off.  TONY ORLANDO AND DAWN play on
        her stereo.

                                TONY ORLANDO
                  Knock three times... on the ceiling
                  if you want me... Twice on the
                  pipes...

        The song continues as the CAMERA SLOWLY PANS up to
        CLOSEUP of Anne, who is fighting with an imaginary Jack.

                                ANNE
                  Ya fuckin' bastard.  I don't need
                  this...
                         (emphasizing)
                  ... I Do Not Need This!  A woman my
                  age... I am a person.  This is kid
                  stuff.  You come!  You go!  And all I
                  do is cook like a jerk!  You're a
                  waste of good cutlets... I don't need
                  this... Find yourself another dope...
                  ya fuckin' bastard...

        She puffs on her cigarette.

                                                   CUT TO:


        EXT. CENTRAL PARK - SHEEPS MEADOW - NIGHT

                                PARRY
                  What a beautiful night.

        HE walks deeper into the open field.  This makes JACK nervous.

                                     JACK
                   Don't you think it's time to go now?
                   Running around here during the day is
                   one thing but at night we could be killed
                   by a wide variety of people.

                                     PARRY
                   Well that's stupid. This is my park
                   just as much as it is theirs. You
                   think it's fair they keep us out
                   just because they make us think we'll
                   get killed or something?

                                     JACK
                   Yes. I think that's very fair.

        PARRY takes off his pants and stands there naked.

                                     JACK
                              (continuing)
                   .....What are you doing?

                                     PARRY
                   Have you ever done any cloudbusting?
                   You lie on your back and you
                   concentrate on the clouds...and you try yo
                   break them apart with your mind.
                   It's wild.

        Parry lies down.

                                     JACK
                   You can't do this! This is New York!
                   Nobody lies in naked in a field in New
                   York..It's...it's too Midwestern.

                                     PARRY
                   Come on, try it. Ya feel the
                   air on your body - ya little
                   fella's flappin' in the breeze.
                   ...everybody in the city is busy
                   with their business and no one knows we're
                   bare assed in the middle of it. Come on!

                                     JACK
                   NO! I will not! This is nuts!
                   I'm leaving! I mean it...this is nuts.
                              (freaked, walking OC)
                   This is too nuts...I'm leaving. I mean it!

        JACK starts walking away from PARRY, talking to himself -

                                     JACK
                   ..Ha...Little fella? I mean
                   the man talks to invisible people -
                   he sees invisible horses - and
                   he's naked in the middle of Central
                   Park. I should be surprised? I'm
                   not surprised. I'm fucking outta
                   my mind to even be here!

                                     PARRY (O.S.)
                   Who are you talking to Jack?

                                     JACK
                              (turns back and yells)
                   YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!

                                     PARRY (O.S.)
                   Bingo!

        HE walks O.C.

                                                     CUT TO:

        EXT. CENTRAL PARK: SHEEPS MEADOW - TEN MINUTES LATER - NIGHT.

        JACK, fully clothed, lies next to PARRY looking up at the clouds.

                                     JACK
                   They're not moving.

        THEY stare up. JACK raises his head. HE unbuttons his shirt -
        maybe that will help...

                                     JACK
                   What if some homophobic jogger runs by and
                   kills us to get back at his overbearing father?

        Parry remains focused on the sky - in his own world.
        Something about cloudbusting makes Parry behave in a way we haven't
        seen before...He is un characteristically quiet.

                                     JACK
                   "JACK LUCAS FOUND DEAD - BESIDE
                   A DEAD NAKED MAN...THE TWO WERE
                   DEAD...HIS COMPANION WAS NAKED"...I hate
                   when they use the word companion...It's
                   so insinuating..Although, it'll probably boost my
                   biography sales. The public loves
                   stories about successful people falling into
                   degenerate behavior. Makes them feel
                   lucky to be boring and ordinary...People stink.

        Parry suddenly speaks - as if talking to a lecture hall.

                                     PARRY
                   Are there any questions?

                                     JACK
                   What?

                                     PARRY
                   Then let's begin with the story itself.
                   It's a story of the Grail myth...And although
                   there are several variations, my favorite
                   begins with the Fisher King as a young boy...
                   who had to spend a night alone in the forest
                   to prove his courage... and during that night,
                   he is visited by a sacred vision. Out of the
                   fire, appears the Holy Grail - God's highest symbol of
                   divine grace. And a voice says to the boy,
                   "You shall be the guardian of the Grail, that it
                   may heal the hearts of men"...But the boy was
                   overcome ...Innocent and foolish, he was
                   blinded by greater visions - a life ahead filled
                   with beauty and glory, hope and power...Tears
                   filled his eyes as he sensed his own... invincibility.
                   A boy's tears of naive wonder and inspiration.
                   and in this state of...radical amazement...he felt
                   for a brief moment, not like a boy, but like God...
                              (Jack listens intently)
                   ...And so he reached into the fire to take the Grail.
                   And the Grail vanished. And the boy hands were
                   left caught in the flames...leaving him wounded
                   and ashamed at what his recklessness had lost him.
                   When he became King, he was determined to
                   reclaim his destiny and find the Grail...
                   But with each year that passed, with each
                   campaign he fought, the Grail remained lost, and
                   this wound he suffered in the fire grew worse...
                   He became a bitter man. Life for him lost it's reason.
                   With each disappointment, with each betrayal...
                   with each loss ... this wound would grow...
                   Soon the land began to spoil from neglect
                   and his people starved...Until finally,
                   the King lost all faith in God's existance and in
                   man's value...He lost his ability to love or be loved
                   And he was so sick with experience...
                   that he started to die. As the years went on,
                   his bravest knights would search for the
                   Grail that would heal their King and
                   make them the most respected and valued men in
                   the land, but to no avail.  Pretty soon, finding
                   the Grail became a ruthless struggle between ambitious
                   men vying for the King's power, which only confirmed
                   the King's worst suspicions of man, causing his
                   wound to grow. His only hope, he thought, was death.
                   Then one day, a fool was brought in to the King
                   to cheer him.  He was a simple-minded man...
                   not particularly skilled...or admired... He
                   tells the King some jokes...sing him some songs,
                   but the King feels even worse...Finally, the
                   fool says, "What is it that hurts you so much?
                   How can I help?"...And the King says, "I need
                   a sip of water to cool my throat"...So, the fool
                   takes a cup from the bedstand, fills it with
                   water and hands it to the King...Suddenly,
                   the King feels a lot better. And when he looks
                   to his hands, he sees that it was the Holy Grail
                   the fool handed him...an ordinary cup that had been
                   beside his bed all along...And the King asks,
                   "How can this be?...how could you find what
                   all my knights and wisest men could not find"?
                   And the fool answers, "I don't know. I only
                   knew you were thirsty."... And for the first time
                   since he was a boy, the King felt more than a man -
                   not because he was touched by God's glory...but
                   rather, by the compassion of a fool.

        JACK doesn't know how to respond. HE's never known PARRY to
        be eloquent. HE gets a glimpse of PARRY as he once was and
        the words come out of his mouth before he knows it:

                                     JACK
                   I'm so sorry.

        But PARRY seems far away. HE speaks like a professor:

                                     PARRY
                   The Fisher King myth has alot of
                   derivations...I remember I was at
                   this lecture in Princeton once -
                   and there was this one speaker...Henry Sa...
                   Henry...uh...Henry...

        HE stops. As if this memory escaped with any warning.

                                     PARRY
                             (continuing)
                   ....What was I saying?

        JACK is as surprised as he is. PARRY'S face is frightened
        and confused again. There is panic in his voice.

                                     PARRY
                             (continuing)
                   ....What was I saying?

        HE raises his head to look and sees:

        EXT. SHEEPS MEADOW: SEVERAL YARDS AWAY - NIGHT.

        THE DARK SILOUETTE OF THE RED KNIGHT UPON HIS HORSE. Staring -
        knowing exactly where PARRY lies even though it's dark.

        PARRY looks frightened as he lays his head back down.
        JACK tries to snap him out of it by saying:

                                     JACK
                   How come you've never asked that
                   girl for a date?

        PARRY looks back to see that the RED KNIGHT has vanished.
        HE snaps out of it somewhat.

                                     PARRY
                   I can't ask for her...I have to earn her.

                                     JACK
                   Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman.
                   It's the twentieth century.

                                     PARRY
                   Maybe, when we get the Grail...

                                     JACK
                   Well, see, I think she can help...You know
                   women are great..they...they make homes
                   and they..ya know, kill the livestock
                   so the knights can go out and get
                   Grails and...and slaughter villages with a
                   clear head...I mean, where would Arthur be
                   without Guinevere...

                                     PARRY
                   Happily married, probably.

                                     JACK
                   Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves
                   you keeps you going...gives you strength...
                   Makes you feel like you can do anything...

                                     PARRY
                   Is that what your girlfriend does for you?

                                     JACK
                              (hesitates, then lies:)
                   Sure...

        INT. LOBBY, MET LIFE BUILDING - MORNING.

        JACK waits near the elevators as the nine-to-five crowd make
        their way into the building.  HE looks like a bum - having
        stayed out all night with PARRY....HE'S so tired he can't
        keep  his  eyes  opened  as  LYDIA walks  with  the  crowd
        to the elevator... Just as the doors close, JACK spots her
        and jumps in between them - causing the inhabitants a jolt.

                                                     CUT TO:

        INT. TWO HEARTS PUBLISHING - MORNING.

        The elevator doors open. LYDIA gets off after two leggy
        businesswomen. JACK follows. SHE walks through two glass
        doors with the words TWO HEARTS PUBLISHING, INC. and enters
        the office. JACK waits until she had disappeared down a
        foyer, then enters the reception area.

                                JACK
                  Could you help me-- what was the name
                  of that girl who just came in...

                                RECEPTIONIST
                  What girl?  I didn't notice.

                                JACK
                  Uh... she was wearing a kind of... a
                  flouncy kind of... uh... plain...

        He makes big gestures with his arms to describe the
        dress, the stringy gestures with his fingers to describe
        her hair.

                                RECEPTIONIST
                         (winning at Charades)
                  Oh, Lydia!

                  Lydia.  Lydia what?

                                RECEPTIONIST
                  God, I have no idea.  She's worked
                  here for fifteen years and I have no
                  idea.  I'll call her.

                                JACK

        INT. VIDEO POP OFFICE - DAY

        Jack is on the phone, with an open Yellow Pages beside
        him.

                  Yes.  Two Hearts Publishing?  May I
                  speak to Lydia please.

        He waits.  Anne enters.  She is obviously very irritated
        with him.

                                ANNE
                  Can I have my desk please.

                                JACK

                  off in a second.

                                ANNE
                  You're calling <u>Lydia</u> in <u>my</u> office.

                  ...<u>Forget it</u>... <u>Goodbye</u>!

        He hangs up.

        Anne sits down at her desk.  She is waiting for an
        explanation.

                                JACK
                  I was not with a woman last night.  I
                  was out with Parry.

                                ANNE

                                JACK
                  He's not a moron.

                                ANNE
                  And who's Lydia?

                                JACK
                  Lydia is the girl Parry likes... And
                  I thought, if I could get them
                  together I...

                  What?  The curse'll be lifted?  <u>Will</u>

                  I... You're not going to understand
                  this.

                                ANNE
                  Don't treat me like I'm stupid.  It
                  pisses me off.

                                JACK
                  All right... Sorry... I feel indebted
                  to him.

                                ANNE
                         (pause)
                  What does that mean?

                                JACK
                  See, I told you!

                                ANNE
                  Well, what the hell does that mean?

                                JACK
                  I thought... if... if I can help him
                  in some way... you know?... get him
                  this girl he loves... Then...
                  maybe.... things'll start changing for

                         (gives up)
                  Forget it... It's a stupid idea.

        Anne looks at him incredulously.  He sits down and
        breathes a sigh -- the absurdity of the idea hitting him
        as well.  Anne softens -- feeling like she has unfairly
        taken the wind out of his sail.

                                ANNE
                  Oh, you poor kid... You're a mess.

        Anne stands and buries Jack's face in her breast.  She
        decides to be positive.

                                ANNE

                  Yeah?  Who is this?

        Her abrupt manner surprises Jack.  Jack uses his old,
        confident radio voice.

                                JACK
                  This is Jack Lucas and I'm calling
                  from Video Pop video rentals.


        INT. LYDIA'S OFFICE - INTERCUT PHONE CALL - DAY

                                LYDIA
                  Yes.

                                JACK
                  Yes well...
                         (guessing and hoping)
                  You are a credit card holder, are you
                  not?

                                LYDIA
                  Huh-huh.

                                JACK
                  Well, congratulations Lydia, because
                  out of several thousand card
                  holders... in conjunction with
                  several major credit card
                  companies...

                                LYDIA
                  Which ones?

                                JACK
                  All of them... Which means <u>you</u> have
                  just won a free membership at our
                  store on Second Avenue.

        He puts the reciever near a tape player and presses play.
        "HAPPY DAYS ARE HERE AGAIN" plays for a moment, then he
        shuts it off.

                                LYDIA
                         (deadpan, not getting it)
                  How did this happen?

        Jack is prepared for Lydia's, shall we say, reluctance to
        buy it!

                                JACK
                  Your name was picked.

                                LYDIA
                         (suspicious... and dense)
                  Well, I don't understand.  What did
                  you do -- did you pick my name out
                  of a hat or... or... a list?

                                JACK
                  A list.

                                LYDIA
                  Well -- were there a lot of people in
                  the room or just you or what?

                                JACK
                         (about to answer)
                  Well there....
                         (then)
                  What's the difference?

                                LYDIA
                  Well, I mean... I don't know you...
                  This has never... I've never won
                  anything and... I don't have a VCR.

                                JACK
                  You get a VCR with the membership.
                         (ANNE hits him)
                  ... For a short time until you get
                  your own.  Listen, why don't you come
                  down to the store and you can check
                  it out.  See if you're interested.

                                LYDIA
                  Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to
                  call me?

                                JACK
                         (fed up)
                  <u>No!</u>  <u>I told you</u>! <u>You won a contest</u>!

        Lydia hangs up.  Jack turns to Anne.

                                     JACK
                           (continuing)
                   ....This is going to be rough.

                                                     CUT TO:

        INT. MET LIFE ELEVATOR - DAY.

        JACK stands beside a costumed GAY BUM in a crowded elevator.
        The Bum warms up to the elevator's muzak. JACK shoves him to stop.

        A somber looking BUSINESSMAN rides along side, reading a
        newspaper. The GAY BUM moves next to him and looks up:

                                     GAY BUM
                   I'm Anne Morrow Lindbergh and I can't
                   find my baby...

        The BUSINESSMAN is stunned...HE laughs...

                                     BUSINESSMAN
                   What?

                                     GAY BUM
                   See, I knew I could make you smile...

                                                     CUT TO:

        INT. TWO HEARTS PUBLISHING - DAY.

        The elevator doors open. JACK stands beside THE GAY BUM who
        carries balloons marked VIDEO SPOT.

                                     JACK
                              (adamant)
                   Remember. One chorus and out.

                                     GAY BUM
                   I'm a man with a mission, Jack.

        THE GAY BUM walks to the office entrance. JACK pushes the down
        button. As the doors close, we hear him say to himself:

                                     JACK
                   I can't believe I'm on a first name
                   basis with these people...

                                                     CUT TO:

        THE GAY BUM enters the reception area, much to the surprise of
        the receptionist.

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                   Can I ... help you?

                                     GAY BUM
                   Is there a mousy woman who works here
                   named Lydia?

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                   Yes..if you'll wait here I'll...

                                     GAY BUM
                   This is a personalized message. I
                   have to give it in person.

        INT. TWO HEARTS PUBLISHING - MOMENTS LATER

        THE GAY BUM strolls nonchalantly into the office and down the aisle 
        relishing in the amazed expressions of the employees. HE approaches
        a cubicle on which he reads a small name plate - LYDIA SINCLAIR.
        LYDIA has her back to him, but slowly turns as she feels someone
        watching her. SHE lets out a tiny scream when she sees him
        standing there like a deranged clown. The GAY BUM take notice of
        her outfit - a cordoroy, forest green jumper with a lime
        green turtleneck -

                                     GAY BUM
                   You MUST be SHE.

                                     LYDIA
                   Huh?

        THE GAY BUM begins to sing a SONG PARODY to the tune of a
        classical musical number. (Song to be chosen). After a big finish,
        the GAY BUM hands LYDIA a business card, drops the act and exits:

                                     GAY BUM
                              (murmurs cynically)
                   Jesus...

        Stunned, LYDIA looks down at the information card she holds
        frozen in her hand.

                                                     CUT TO:

        INT. VIDEO STOP - 5:30 THE NEXT DAY.

        C.U. on ANNE, who is slighted repulsed by PARRY.

        JACK PARRY; his hair slicked back, wearing a Video Spot T-shirt
        over his clothes. Jack hangs a car pine freshner around PARRY's
        neck to help with the smell...The bell on front door jingles.

        LYDIA cautiously enters the store.

        Behind the counter, JACK spots her immediately and nudges ANNE.
        SHE turns to look, her bra straps are visible. JACK fixes them.

                                     LYDIA
                   Hello. My name is Lydia Sinclair.

                                     JACK
                   Yes. Hi..Congratulations. Jack Lucas.
                   Nice to meet you finally. This is Anne
                   Napolitano, the owner of Video Spot.

                                     ANNE
                   Hello....congratulations.

                                     JACK
                   And this is our other..uh...co-worker..
                   Parry..uh...Parry....

                                     LYDIA
                   Parry Parry?

                                     PARRY
                   No just Parry.

                                     LYDIA
                   Oh...like Moses.

        No one knows how to respond to this, so they don't.

                                     LYDIA
                              (continuing; curt)
                   So how do we do this?

                                     JACK
                   Well..um...you get an official
                   membership card...
                         (takes one out)
                  Just sign that and we'll laminate it
                  right here... Parry?  You want to
                  laminate Miss Sinclair's card?...

        Parry stands staring at her.

                                JACK
                         (continuing)
                  ...Parry?

        Parry snaps out of it and crosses from behind the counter
        to the laminating machine next to Jack.

                                ANNE
                  This will last you one year after
                  which you have the option to renew
                  if... you like at a membership
                  discount.

                                LYDIA
                         (defensive)
                  But now it's free, right?

                                ANNE
                  Yeah.

        Anne backs off.  She stands next to an equally perplexed
        Jack as they watch Lydia fill out the card.  Her abrasive
        demeanor is not what they expected.  Lydia finishes the
        card and pushes it toward them.

                                LYDIA
                  Now what?

                                JACK
                  Uh... you... you can pick out up to
                  ten movies...

                                LYDIA
                  Free?

                                JACK
                  Yes.  They're free.

                                ANNE
                         (butts in)
                  Only the first ten.  After that
                  they're 2.99 a rental.

        Lydia eyes Anne suspiciously, then turns to survey the
        shelves.  Parry picks up her card and laminates it -- all
        the while, keeping his eyes fixed upon Lydia's every
        move.  Anne and Jack, having set the trap, watch with
        interest.

        Lydia surveys the film boxes, H-L.  She spots one of
        interest and pulls it off the shelf -- causing two other
        boxes to fall down on her.  She catches one box and, as
        she replaces it back on the shelf, causes three more to
        fall.  She catches two of the three.

        Parry, Anne and Jack watching with an odd fascination.
        Jack nudges Parry to forget the laminating and go help
        her.  Parry gathers up his nerve and moves from around
        the counter, up behind her.

                                PARRY
                  ... Can... can I help you?

        Lydia quickly turns -- she is uncomfortable by his
        closeness.

                                LYDIA
                  No.  No... I can look myself...

        She moves away abruptly -- like a fox terrier who
        pretends to ignore the mess she made on the living room
        rug.

        Parry turns to Jack and Anne, as if to say "what do I do
        now?"  Jack encourages him to keep trying.  Parry
        organizes the boxes and picks one out.

                                PARRY
                  How about the "Hell Merchants"?

                                LYDIA
                  I don't like horror movies!

                                PARRY
                         (reads)
                  How about... Zbiegnew Speizak's "The
                  Purple Bread," an intensely portrayed
                  tale of love and envy set against the
                  sweeping background of a Polish
                  bakery.  In subtitles.

                                LYDIA
                  I don't like... uh...
                         (finding it hard to
                          categorize)
                  Polish love stories...
                         (she turns her back
                          on him, but adds)
                  ... I like musicals.

                                PARRY
                         (encouraged)
                  Well, we have plenty of those.  Right
                  over here.  We got the MGM series,
                  Astaire and Rogers, the Judy
                  Garlands...

                                LYDIA
                  Got any Ethel Merman?

        He doesn't see any.  He looks to Anne, who shakes her
        head.

                                PARRY
                  ... Uh... we seem to be all out of
                  Ethel Merman.

                                LYDIA
                  What a gyp.

                                PARRY
                  Yeah.

        Jack nudges Anne to do something.

                                ANNE
                  You know, I think I... ordered some
                  just the other day.

                                LYDIA
                  Well did you or didn't you?

                                ANNE
                         (pissed off)
                  Yes!  They'll be in soon.

                                LYDIA
                  Well, I guess I'll come back then.

                                JACK
                  Here's your card.

        Lydia walks back to the counter.  As Jack hands her the
        card, she notices Anne's painted star fingernails.

                                LYDIA
                  I like your nails.  Where did you get
                  them done?

                                ANNE
                  Ah... I do them myself.  I used to
                  work in a beauty parlor.

        Lydia keeps staring at them.  She says blankly;

                                LYDIA
                  I like the stars.

        Jack gets an idea.

                                JACK
                  You know, Anne does other people too.
                  Sort of a sideline...
                         (Anne is surprised to hear
                          this.
                  ... If you want, she could do your
                  nails.

                                LYDIA
                  How much?

                                JACK
                  Well, since you're a member, we
                  could...

                                ANNE
                         (interrupts)
                  Twenty dollars.

        Lydia considers the offer.  Parry waits for the outcome.

                                LYDIA
                  Okay... twenty dollars... When can
                  you...

                                JACK
                  Tonight!  How's tonight?

        Lydia thinks.  Anne is ready to kill Jack.  Parry smiles
        hopefully.

                                                   CUT TO:


        INT. ANNE'S APARTMENT - THAT EVENING

        Jack searches frantically through a closet.  Anne and
        Parry sit opposite each other at the table.  Parry is
        eating Anne's homecooking voraciously.  Anne doesn't
        quite know how to take Parry, who smiles mischieviously
        through his meal.

                                ANNE
                         (to Jack O.S.)
                  Getting your nails done is one thing
                  but going to dinner with a bunch of
                  strangers and <u>him</u>... She didn't even
                  look at him.

                                PARRY
                  Got any more bread crust?

        As Anne resentfully rises and crosses into the kitchen,
        Parry focuses on her robust breasts bouncing beneath the
        sweater.  Anne's expression, as she serves him, is a
        mixture of repulsion and fascination... She sits at the
        table.

                                JACK (O.S.)
                  We'll make it very casual... not like 
                  a date or anything.  I just have to
                  find something he'll look good in.

        Anne looks at Parry as if this were an impossibility.
        Parry smiles back -- he likes Anne.

                                ANNE
                  I don't know... He's a little
                  disgusting... Although some women go
                  for that.

                                JACK (O.S.)
                  He just needs some clothes?

                                PARRY
                  Got any more starchy food?

        Another opportunity to watch Anne's breasts in action, as
        she reluctantly rises to get him more macaroni.  She
        returns with the pot.

                                ANNE
                  I mean, I've gone out with bums, but
                  they were gorgeous.  It's the only
                  reason to go out with a bum.

                                PARRY
                  This food's delicious.  You're a
                  wonderful cook.  And you have a
                  lovely home.

                                ANNE
                  Jack, he's starting a conversation...

                                JACK (O.S.)
                  Well talk back.  He won't bite you.

                                ANNE
                         (cool and polite)
                  Thank you very much.

                                PARRY
                         (enjoying the conversation)
                  Your welcome.  You know, a
                  beautiful woman like yourself -- your
                  own business -- I'm surprised some
                  guy doesn't snatch you up for his
                  own.

        Anne looks in Jack's direction, but replies to Parry:

                                ANNE
                  <u>You're surprised</u>!... But I guess I
                  just never met the right guy.  Whatta
                  gonna do?

                                PARRY
                  I'm shocked.  With a child bearing
                  body like yours...
                         (Anne doesn't know how
                          to take that)
                  ... why a man would have to be out of
                  his mind!

                                ANNE
                  Most men are.

                                PARRY
                  Why this is outrageous!...

        Parry, getting overly heated, slams down his fork.  Anne
        jumps.

                                PARRY
                         (continuing)
                  ... A woman of your value going to
                  waste before my eyes....
                         (rising intensity)
                  Come on!  I'm yours!  Let's go!
                         (clears the table with
                          one move)
                  Come on -- let us go to that place of
                  splendor in the grass.

        He starts to unzip his pants.

                                ANNE
                  <u>Jack</u>!

        Climbing over the table to her, he seranades.

                                PARRY
                  Holdin' my penis...
                  What a lovely way of sayin' how
                  Much ya like me...

                                ANNE
                  <u>What are you, out of your mind</u>!

        Jack enters...

                                PARRY
                  Holdin' my penis...

                                JACK
                  <u>Parry</u>!  Close your pants...

        Parry stops singing and gets off the table.  He bows to
        her.

                                PARRY
                         (kidding)
                  You sure now?

        Anne looks at him like she's going to belt him.

                                PARRY
                         (continuing)
                  ... Well alright.  But you let me
                  know.
                         (with great
                          sincerity)
                  You're too good a woman to go to
                  waste.

        Anne, in spite of herself, agrees with him.  She looks to
        Jack to see if he agrees, but Jack is too busy inspecting
        Parry.

                                JACK
                  What are you -- a 40 in a jacket?

        Anne, frustrated with the two of them, exits.


        EXT. VIDEO POP - NIGHT

        Lydia walks up and RINGS the bell.  BUZZED in -- she
        enters.

                                                   CUT TO:


        INT. ANNE'S APARTMENT - LATER THAT EVENING

        Anne's opens the door to a cautious Lydia.  Lydia nods,
        self-consiously, as if to say, "Yeah, I'm here".

                                ANNE
                  Hello... welcome... Come in.

        Lydia enters, subtly inspecting the apartment.

                                LYDIA
                  I've never been in an apartment above
                  a store.  You always pass them on the
                  street but you never think anyone
                  really lives in them.

                                     ANNE
                           (raising an eyebrow)
                   Can I get you anything...coffee...
                   tea...a little tequilla?

                                     LYDIA
                   No, thank you.

        LYDIA sits at the formica table, already set up with nail care
        paraphernalia - with the gleaming steel nail files it looks a
        bit like surgery equipment.

                                     LYDIA
                   Will it hurt?

                                     ANNE
                      (threateningly)
                   That all depends on you.
                   ...Sure you don't want a drink?

        LYDIA's a little nervous about this attempt at nail beauty.

                                                     CUT TO:

        INT. PARRY'S BASEMENT - NIGHT.

        Jack is cleaning up Parry - perhaps applying a green mud
        treatment.

                                                     CUT TO:

        INT. ANNE'S APARTMENT - LATER THAT EVENING.

        ANNE is seated at her formica table opposite LYDIA. SHE
        delicately holds one of LYDIA'S hands, carefully applying the
        stars to her nails. LYDIA sips her tequilla with one hand.
        ANNE'S glass is almost empty as she talks non-stop;

                                     ANNE
                   ...So he says to me, "you'll never find
                   another man like me"...I said, "please,
                   men like you have one hand on their
                   dicks and the other hand on their
                   mother's leg... I said, there's
                   the door - take a trip.

                                     LYDIA
                      (paying close attention)
                   You threw him out?

        ANNE makes a confident nod. LYDIA sips.

                                     LYDIA
                   My parents were divorced.

                                     ANNE
                   It's an awful thing, let me tell you.
                   My Aunt used to say,
                      (emphasizing)
                    "divorce is the sister-in-law of death".

        ANNE nods knowingly. LYDIA squints as she considers this.

                                                     CUT TO:

        INT. PARRY'S BASEMENT - SAME TIME.

        JACK stands behind a seated PARRY in front of a mirror.
        PARRY'S hair is wet. JACK places a can of styling mousse
        in front of him. PARRY squeezes a ball of mousse in his hand,
        then applies it to his head....PARRY proceeds to experiment
        with a number of styles - adding more and more mousse as JACK
        watches in silence. PARRY molds his hair into a cone, then
        divides into two cones, then mushes it into a pompadour, then
        splits the pompadour - PARRY is having a wonderful time -
        applying enormous amounts to his head and eyebrows....Finally,
        JACK grabs the can out of PARRY'S hand.

                                                     CUT BACK TO:

        INT. ANNE'S APARTMENT - A LITTLE LATER.

        ANNE works on LYDIA'S other hand, as LYDIA sips her tequilla
        from a straw.

                                     ANNE
                   ...SO...anybody special in your life?

                                     LYDIA
                             (defensive)
                   Do I look like I have someone special?

        SHE moves to picks up her tequilla with the manicured hand but
        ANNE eyes her down.

                                     ANNE
                   Well, don't say it like that. It's not
                   so...ya know, crazy an idea.
                   You are a healthy woman... You
                   hold a steady job. Ya not crossed
                   eyed or anything...

                                     LYDIA
                   Well, there's nobody special!

                                     ANNE
                   Fine.

                                     LYDIA
                      (pause, then:)
                   I mean, it's not easy in this day and age.

                                     ANNE
                   What?

                                     LYDIA
                   Meeting ... people.

                                     ANNE
                   Tell me about it. I've been dating
                   longer than I've been driving. I
                   can't believe that.

                                     LYDIA
                   I never really...went through a...
                   dating period.

                                     ANNE
                   It's a disgusting process. You haven't
                   missed anything.

        LYDIA nods in agreement, but her face tells us she feels she has
        missed a great deal.

        INT. PARRY'S BASEMENT - NIGHT

        PARRY, cleaned and dressed up - his hair moussed back, the suit
        is too big.  PARRY paces back and forth in the hallway as JACK
        tries to staple the sleeves of the suit shorter for PARRY's arms.

                                     JACK
                   Will you stand still so I can do this!

                                     PARRY
                   I'm sorry....I'm just so excited.
                      (JACK smiles)
                   You must have felt this way when
                   you first met Anne, huh?
                   Where did you two meet?

                                     JACK
                   In a bar called Hellfire.

                                     PARRY
                   Tch...how romantic. Yeah. If I
                   wasn't already committed to
                   Lydia, boy. Except Anne'd never go for
                   me though. She loves you too much.
                   And you really love her, huh?

                                     JACK
                   No. But that's not the only reason
                   people get together or..stay together.

                                     PARRY
                   What are the other reasons?

        JACK thinks a moment, then answers plainly:

                                     JACK
                   Survival.

        PARRY puts his arm on JACK'S shoulder and speaks very sincerely.

                                     PARRY
                      (earnest)
                   You love her alot Jack. You're ...
                   crazy about her...It's just that,
                   sometimes, you're a little bit of an asshole.

        JACK is surprised by the remark and abruptly focuses on PARRY.

        INT. ANNE'S APARTMENT - LATER

        LYDIA is a little more loose and talkative now as ANNE refills
        her glass, then takes LYDIA'S other hand to apply the stars.

                                     LYDIA
                      (deadpan)
                   ...My mother calls every week.
                   Like a recurring nightmare.
                   "So, have you met anyone?"..."No mom"..
                   "So what's going to happen?"...
                   "I don't know Mom"...
                   I only thank God I moved out.

                                     ANNE
                   I can't believe you lived with
                   her for that long. If I had to live
                   with my mother, I'd stab myself six times.

                                     LYDIA
                   I think some people are meant to be alone.
                      (she takes a slug)
                   Maybe I was a man in a former life
                   and I used women for pleasure so
                   now I'm paying for it - which would
                   be fine, if I could just remember
                   some of the pleasure parts...
                      (drinks)

                                     ANNE
                   I don't understand you. What is the problem?

                                     LYDIA
                   I don't feel like I make any impression on people...
                   At office parties I spend my time
                   re-arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat
                   them, so the platters will always look full.
                   I don't start conversations because I have
                   no idea how to end them...I think I'm
                   just meant to live in the background
                   of things.

                                     ANNE
                   That's not true...You gotta ease up...
                   Conversations have a life of their own.
                   You gotta just go with it...We're having
                   a lovely conversation.

                                     LYDIA
                      (bluntly)
                   I'm paying you.

        ANNE drops her hand. SHE's pissed.

                                     ANNE
                   You know, let me tell you something!
                   I'm not that kind of person. I don't
                   do people favors. If I talk to you
                   it's because I want to. So we're not
                   all ...uh...Jerri Hall...Big deal...
                   What a boring world if we were.
                   You do the best you can with what you got.
                   You're not so so invisible, ya know...
                   You want make an impression? Try this;
                   you can be a real bitch.

                                     LYDIA
                      (her face lights up)
                   Really?

                                     ANNE
                   Yeah!

        LYDIA smiles at the thought of having such an impressionable
        personality..

        EXT. VIDEO POP - NIGHT.

        JACK tries to calm PARRY down.

                                     JACK
                   Come here...you're all crooked.
                     (HANDS HIM WALLET)
                   Here's my wallet, so you can pay for dinner?

        JACK adjusts PARRY'S tie, then undoes it and re-ties.
        PARRY takes wallet, keeping his eyes on JACK, as JACK primps him.

                                     PARRY
                   ...You're a nice man, Jack.
                   Doing all this for me...

        JACK doesn't pay attention as PARRY'S expression grows pale and
        frightened. HE suddenly raps his arms around JACK and whispers;

                                     PARRY
                   I'm scared Jack.

        JACK, uncomfortable at the intimacy, tries to comfort him.

                                     PARRY
                   ...I feel so much for her...I
                   feel like something awful is going to happen.

                                     JACK
                   No. Nothing bad's going to happen.
                   Anne'll be there. I'll be there.
                   Nothing bad will happen.

                                     PARRY
                   I'm still scared.

                                                     CUT BACK TO:

        INT. ANNE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT.

        ANNE and LYDIA share a drink....

                                     ANNE
                   It's hard being a woman. I don't care what
                   anybody says...People say we have choices -
                   we have <u>no</u> choices...My grandma used to
                   say that, for a woman in this world, behind
                   every door there's either death...or husband.

        LYDIA cracks up laughing.

                                     LYDIA
                   "Sister-in-law of death"...That's wonderful.

    SHE takes another sip as JACK knocks on the door and enters with PARRY.

                                     JACK
                   Anne...!
                      (to LYDIA)
                   Oh hi? How's it going?

        Lydia loses her smile and becomes self-conscious and protective.

                                     JACK
                   Parry, it's Lydia Sinclair - our membership winner.

                                     PARRY
                   I know!

        JACK turns to find that PARRY is still outside the apartment.
        HE crosses to PARRY. The two whisper intensely....

                                     ANNE
                   What are you two up to?

                                     JACK
                   Well..everything's closed up.
                   We thought we'd get some dinner.
                      (overplaying it)
                   Say!....Anybody up for Chinese?
                      (to LYDIA)
                   Have you eaten? Would you
                   like to come along?

                                     LYDIA
                      (rises, uncomfortable)
                   Oh, no..I have to get home...

                                     ANNE
                   The nails!! Watch the nails!!...
                      (LYDIA sits back down)
                   Listen, you still have to eat.

        PARRY stands in b.g. with JACK, whispering....

                                     LYDIA
                   No really..I can't.

                                     ANNE
                   Hey? What did I tell you?
                   Why don't you come? It's just dinner.
                   You'll have something to tell
                   your mother next time she calls.

        LYDIA smiles as PARRY and JACK reach an agreement.
        All four turn to each other spontaneously and say:

                                     ANNE, JACK, LYDIA, PARRY
                   Fine.

                                                     CUT TO:

        EXT. STREET NEAR BROOKLYN BRIDGE - NIGHT.

        PARRY and LYDIA walk and talk.  ANNE and JACK walk behind them.

                                     LYDIA
                   ...I..uh..I get to read some of the books
                   but mostly I..just calculate production
                   costs from first edition hard cover
                   publication to paperback. After
                   paperback it's basically someone
                   else's problem.

                                     PARRY
                   It sounds exciting.

                                     LYDIA
                   Why does it sound exciting? There's
                   absolutely nothing exciting about it.

        As Parry talks, he picks up a piece of garbage on the sidewalk.

                                     PARRY
                   Well, you're calculating costs that
                   could have an affect on whether or
                   not the book is published and if
                   it is, it could be a book that...
                   ....might somehow change the way people
                   think or act - a book can do that.
                   And you would be a part of creating
                   a cultural shift that could change
                   our society forever.

        Parry drops the garbage in a garbage can and is almost
        about to browse through it when:

                                     JACK
                   Parry!

        Parry is alerted by Jack that this would be inappropriate.
        However, he does take a wire champagne cork wrapper, indiscreetly.

                                     LYDIA
                   We mostly publish trashy romance novels.

                                     PARRY
                   Well - empires have fallen
                   because of trashy romances...

        Parry seems to be fashioning something out of the wire.

                                     PARRY
                             (continuing)
                   ...Romance is romance no matter what kind
                   it is...It could be a Victorian lady
                   kidnapped by a viral sea captain
                   with a hairy chest...or a horny pizza boy
                   seduced by a housewife with a hairy upper lip.
                   As long as there's heart, passion,
                   and little bit of fantasy...romance is
                   the stuff of dreams...there's always
                   more to trash than meets the eye...

        With this, Parry shows her his creation - a little wire chair
        made from the champagne wire. Lydia is impressed. Their
        eyes meet for a dangerous moment, until:

        A LARGE MAN walks by, bumping into LYDIA without apology and
        knocking Parry's gift to the ground....

                                     PARRY
                   ...Hey!

        The LARGE MAN continues walking as PARRY reaches to his back
        pocket to pull out his SLINGSHOT when:

                                     JACK/ANNE
                   PARRY!

        PARRY begrudgingly lets him go.

                                     MARTIN (O.S.)
                   Parry!...Parry - is that you!

        Parry spots a familiar homeless face, sitting on the curb.

                                     PARRY
                   Hey Martin...!

                                     MARTIN
                   Don't you look all duded up!

                                     PARRY
                   This is Lydia!

                                     MARTIN
                   Nice to meet you Lydia! Got a quarter?!

        PARRY smiles proudly.  A mortified LYDIA reachs in her purse
        and hands Martin a quarter...Anne and Jack watch in disbelief.

                                     MARTIN
                   Thank you. God bless...
                        (to Parry)
                   Nice girl...Have you set the date yet?

        Lydia hurries away. Parry follows....The walk continues:

                                     LYDIA
                   How do you know him?

                                     PARRY
                   We were neighbors for a couple for weeks
                   on Sutton Place.

                                     Lydia
                   You lived on Sutton Place?

                                     PARRY
                       (proudly)
                   Yep! Right on it!

                                     ANNE
                          (tries to save it)
                   Huh...the restaurant's just around the
                   corner here...

        They nod. After a beat, Lydia asks:

                                     LYDIA
                   What do you do - for a living I mean?

                                     PARRY
                   Well, I'm in search of the Holy Grail.

        JACK smacks his own forehead, exasperated. ANNE gives up.

                                                     CUT TO:

        INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT.

        ANNE and LYDIA sit opposite JACK and PARRY.
        THEY are served three large orders of dumplings.

                                     ANNE
                   Oh..I could eat all of these

        LYDIA is nervous about this. As everyone begins to eat, SHE
        eyes her chopsticks with reluctance.

        PARRY looks at her and smiles encouragingly.
        LYDIA forces a smile back, picks up her chopsticks and dives in.
        PARRY watches her in adoration. JACK subtly tries to get PARRY
        to stop staring. But PARRY is glued to his vision.

        LYDIA, even more awkward now with her new nails, drops her first
        dumpling into her lap.

                                     LYDIA
                   Oh..god...

        To save her from embarassment, PARRY drops his dumpling into his
        lap as well.

                                     PARRY
                   Oh boy...

        LYDIA takes her napkin and dips it into a glass of water.
        PARRY follows suit.

        When LYDIA removes the napkin, her glass falls over.
        PARRY forces his glass over, as well.

        ANNE and JACK are looking at this mirror exercise in fascination.

                                     PARRY
                      (to LYDIA)
                   Can't take us anywhere, huh?

        LYDIA can't help but smile - a little more at ease now. Grateful
        she is not the clumsy center of attention.

        JACK leans over and whispers to ANNE:

                                     JACK
                   What do you think?

                                     ANNE
                   I think they're made for each other.
                   And it scares me.

                                                     FADE TO:

        LATER IN THE EVENING.

        WE PAN the table as everyone eats their main courses.

        LYDIA, we discover, has another eating idiosyncracy. SHE
        unconsciously, but quite loudly, smacks her mouth when she chews.

                                     LYDIA (O.C.)
                   SMACK..SMACK...SMACK...

        WE HEAR THIS SMACKING OFF CAMERA as we begin on JACK; trying not
        to look at LYDIA but having difficulty enjoying his own meal.
        CAMERA moves to PARRY, staring at her, helplessly in love, not
        paying any attention to his own food; moving to LYDIA "SMACK,
        SMACKING" , beginning to accept PARRY'S attraction in her and,
        warming up to the idea, SHE throws a smile at him in between
        "smacks"; and finally ANNE, chewing quietly, staring at JACK
        with her eyes widened twice their normal size, indicating her
        disbelief at LYDIA'S vocal variety of noises.

                                                     CUT TO:

        PARRY

        gazing at his sweetheart, a song to seranade comes to
        mind and he softly begins:

                                PARRY
                  Lydia... Oh Lydia... That
                  encyclopedia.  Oh Lydia the tattooed
                  lady...

        His gentle voice counterbalances the odd lyrics and makes
        it sound like a love song.

        Anne eyes Jack to stop him.

        Jack is about to make an attempt but can't seem to find
        the way, so he doesn't bother.

        Lydia doesn't know how to respond either.  At first she
        smiles politely, then she pretends to be too busy eating
        to listen -- but something about Parry's sincerity pulls
        her in.  His face glows as he floats the lyrics across
        the table to her.  Slowly, her "smacking" subsides, she
        lowers her fork, forgets her self-consciousness and
        listens to Parry -- slightly hypnotized; like a little
        girl watching a ballerina for the first time.

        Jack is fascinated by Parry's complete adoration of this
        mess of a woman.  He looks to Anne, who tries to continue
        her meal nonchalantly.  He notices her bra strap hanging
        out from her sweater.

        CAMERA CUTS BACK AND FORTH between the exposed strap and
        Jack, as Parry continues seranading O.S.  Anne realizes
        Jack is staring at her and immediately thinks something's
        wrong.  But Jack just smiles at her.  His hand reaches
        across the table, not to fix her sweater, but to take her
        hand.  Anne is in shock.  She slips her hand into his and
        smiles back, her eyes almost tearing.

        When Parry finishes, he smiles.

                                PARRY
                  Would it be all right... I mean would
                  you mind... if I walked you home
                  tonight?

        Lydia nods.  From O.S., Parry's hand holds a napkin and
        gently dabs a stain of soy sauce on her sleeve.

                                                   CUT TO:

        EXT.  VIDEO SPOT - NIGHT.

                                     ANNE
                   I tell ya, I'm very surprised.
                   She seemed to go for him. Hmmm...
                   There's somebody for everybody, huh?

        JACK very pleased with himself.

                                     JACK
                   You know, I can't believe I did it.
                   You think it'll work out?

                                     ANNE
                   Who's knows. My Aunt Marge used to say,
                   "some matches are made in heaven,
                   some are made in hell and some are made
                   in hardware stores".

                                     JACK
                   Nothing it's just...I begining to understand you.

                                     ANNE
                       (smiles)
                   Well...I think you should feel very
                   proud. You did a real nice thing
                   for somebody else. I'm very proud.

                                     JACK
                   You were great. Thanks alot.

        HE kisses her hard and long. ANNE pulls away to catch her breath.
        SHE is surprised, to say the least.

                                     ANNE
                   Your welcome.

        JACK tenderly brushes her hair off her face. HE kisses her again,

                                     ANNE
                   Oh my.

                                                     CUT TO:

        EXT. LYDIA'S STREET - NIGHT.

        PARRY and LYDIA walk - noticably more comfortable with each
        other than before.

                                     PARRY
                   Tell me more. I want to know everything.

                                     LYDIA
                   There isn't any more to tell.

                                     PARRY
                   Don't say that.

                                     LYDIA
                      (genuine)
                   No, really..believe me - there
                   isn't any more. This is it.

                                PARRY
                  Well, it's enough for me.

                                LYDIA
                  You don't have to say that.

                                PARRY
                  I never say anything I have to.

                                LYDIA
                  I mean you don't have to say nice
                  things to me... That kind of thing is
                  a little old fashioned for what we're
                  about to do.

                                PARRY
                  What are we about to do?

                                LYDIA
                  Well... you're walking me home.  I...
                  I guess you're sort of... attracted
                  to me and you'll want to come
                  upstairs for... coffee...

                                PARRY
                  I don't drink coffee...

                                LYDIA
                  ... and then we'll probably have a
                  drink and talk and get comfortable
                  with each other and... and we'll...
                  then you'll sleep over and then in
                  the morning...
                         (driving herself into a
                          complex)
                  ... you'll be distant and you won't
                  be... able to stay for breakfast...
                  you'll just have some coffee maybe...

                                PARRY
                  I don't drink coffee...

                                LYDIA
                  And then we'll exchange phone numbers
                  and you'll leave and never call and
                  I'll go to work and feel great for
                  the first hour and then slowly turn
                  into a piece of dirt by lunch.  Why
                  am I putting myself through this?
                         (to Parry, as she quickens
                          her pace)
                  It was very nice... uh meeting you.
                  Good night..

        She walks quickly away.  Parry stops, confused to say the
        least, then runs after her.  Lydia is just about to enter
        the front door of her building when Parry stops her.

                                PARRY
                  Excuse me...

                                LYDIA
                  Listen, I'm not feeling well.

                                PARRY
                  Well, no wonder.  We just met, made
                  love and broke up all in the space of
                  thirty seconds and I can't even
                  remember the first kiss which is the
                  best part.

                                LYDIA
                  Listen, you're very nice... b...

                                PARRY
                  So are you, but I think maybe you
                  should shut up now...
                         (Lydia is surprised)
                  ... I'm not coming up to your
                  apartment.  That was never my idea.

                                LYDIA
                  Oh... You mean you don't want to.

                                PARRY
                         (deeply sincere)
                  Oh no, I want to.
                         (sweetly)
                  I've got a hard-on for you the size
                  of Canada... but I don't... want
                  just one night.  I have a confession
                  to make?

                                LYDIA
                  You're married.

                                PARRY
                  No.

                                LYDIA
                  Divorced.

                                PARRY
                  No, I...

                                LYDIA
                  You have a disease.

                                PARRY
                  Will you stop!...
                         (pause, he looks at her)
                  ... I'm in love with you...

        Lydia is about to speak when Parry puts his hand over her
        mouth.

                                PARRY
                  ... It's not just from tonight.  I've
                  known you for a long time.  I see you
                  come out of work every day.  I walk
                  with you to lunch.  I know what you
                  order... I see you buy Baby Ruths
                  before going back in...
                         (slowly removes his hand)
                  I know how you feel on certain days
                  by whether or not you go into the
                  bookstore...
                         (Lydia listens with
                          fascination)
                  ... I know you hate your job and you
                  don't have many friends and you
                  sometimes feel like you're not as...
                  as wonderful as everybody else and
                  you're a little uncoordinated
                         (Lydia begins to cry)
                  ... and feeling like you're the only
                  one who's as separate and... alone as
                  you are... and I love you.   I love
                  you.  I think you're the greatest
                  thing since... spice racks and I
                  would be knocked out several times if
                  I even got just a first kiss.  But
                  I'll be back in the morning.  And I
                  won't be distant.  And I will call if
                  you let me... But I still don't drink
                  coffee.

                                LYDIA
                  Shhh...

        She kisses him, tentatively -- almost awkwardly.  Parry
        feels a surge of emotion that makes his whole body
        tremble.  Lydia separates from him and looks into his
        eyes.  She pinches his cheek, hard.

                                LYDIA
                         (continuing; earnestly)
                  You <u>are</u> real, aren't you?

        They kiss again.  Then Lydia quickly pulls away...

                                LYDIA
                         (continuing)
                  ... You can call...

        She runs into the building, afraid to linger and ruin the
        moment.  Parry stands transfixed, his eyes following her.

        Lydia pauses briefly to look back.  She is so excited.
        She smiles and turns toward the elevator... her skirt
        spinning with her.

                                                   CUT TO:


        INT. LYDIA'S BUILDING - ELEVATOR - SECONDS LATER

        She re-enacts the entire love scene in her mind, to make
        sure it went as well as she thinks.

                                                   CUT TO:


        EXT. LYDIA'S BUILDING - NIGHT

        PARRY is standing frozen... We don't know whether he's
        looking ahead of him or in his mind's eye... He appears
        anxious and frightened as he steps back, away from
        Lydia's building... He senses someone is watching him.
        Parry smiles.  But suddenly it is as if everything has
        gone into SLOW MOTION.  His eyes focus on her skirt as it
        swirls around as she turns... His expression grows dark:
        O.S. we hear a horses HOOVES moving in slowly as CAMERA
        moves to CLOSEUP.  He slowly turns his head and looks
        down the block to the corner to see:

        The Red Knight.  He sits upon his horse as if waiting for
        Parry.  The street lamps cast a glow around his imposing
        figure.  The night air lifts his cape up around his
        massive shoulders.

        Parry, vulnerable, in love, whispers plainly:

                                PARRY
                  Let me have this.

                                                   CUT TO:

        THE RED KNIGHT

        silent, unforgiving, unrelenting.

        Parry begins to move away, taking a step back and then
        another and another... until he is running down toward
        the opposite corner.

        The Red Knight shifts his horse into Parry's direction
        and begins to charge.  Parry runs through deserted city
        streets -- running for his life; the sounds of the Red
        Knight GALLOPINGS grows closer.  The Red Knight, looks
        like a surreal figure hunting his prey.

        As Parry runs, IMAGES/MEMORIES begin to flood his mind 
        uncontrollably;


        EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

        An ambulance arriving at a hospital... his wounded wife
        being moved on a stretcher.

                                                   CUT BACK TO:


        EXT. LYDIA'S STREET - NIGHT

        Parry running away from the Knight.

        INT. BABBITT'S - NIGHT

        Parry and his wife at the side bar.  He is making her
        laugh uncontrollably.  He sees Edwin in the doorway,
        making nothing of it.

                                                   CUT TO:


        EXT. STREET - NIGHT

        Parry still running.

                                PARRY
                  <u>Sstttoppp</u>!!!

        Passers-by on the street witness the familiar sight of a
        bum screaming at thin air then turn away.  We hear the
        GALLOPING getting louder.

        Parry runs, mumbling incoherently.  People on the street
        get out of his way or snicker behind his back.  The Red
        Knight gallops toward PARRY, as he runs; his face wet
        with tears -- yet contorting with angry, incomprehensible
        reprisals.  People on the street pay no attention.

                                                   CUT TO:


        EXT. BABBITT'S - NIGHT

        A bar with broken glass surrounded by police and

        Parry and his wife waltzing.  CLOSEUP on their clasped
        hands as Parry maneuvers a ring on her finger.


        INT. BABBITT'S - NIGHT

        His wife's lifeless hand lifted onto the stretcher.


        EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

        Surprised, Parry's wife stops dancing to look at the
        ring.  Parry smiles.  It is his proposal...


        EXT. BABBITT'S - NIGHT

        Ambulance driving away with Parry holding his wife's hand
        in the back...


        EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

        Dancing, his wife embraces him as she accepts.


        INT. TV NEWS STATION - NIGHT

        Jack's face on a TV news broadcast with a reporter
        commenting.

        EXT. EAST RIVER PROMENADE - NIGHT

        Parry has run all the way to the promenade along the
        river.

                                PARRY
                  <u>Come on</u>!... <u>Where are you</u>!!!  <u>Where</u>
                  <u>are you</u>!!
                         (softer, dropping to his
                          knees)
                  Where are you...

                                                   CUT TO:


        EXT. THE END OF THE PROMENADE - NIGHT

        The two juvenile delinquents, Leather and Windbreaker,
        come strutting down the promenade, in SLOW MOTION.  Parry
        looks toward them, as if surrendering.

        Through PARRY'S POV we see the two youths are being lead
        by the Red Knight on his horse.

        Parry, tear-stained face, rises to meet them.  The Youths
        reach Parry and surround him.  Leather flicks open a
        switchblade.

                                LEATHER
                  ... We're tired of looking at you
                  people...

        Parry stands before them, surrendering to his fate.

        Through his POV, the Red Knight is pointing a sword at
        him in front of Leather and his switchblade.  He slashes
        at Parry's chest as we...

        him.

        INT. ANNE'S APARTMENT - MORNING

        Outside the bathroom door, we hear the toilet FLUSH.
        Anne exits in an imitation silk kimono, feeling very much
        the satisfied woman.  She crosses into the living room
        and finds Jack, on the phone in mid-conversation, beside
        his open box of radio tapes.  She hugs him from behind as
        he talks, still warm from their all night lovemaking...

                                JACK
                         (excited, very "on")
                  ... Well, ya know, I'm feeling good,
                  Lou... I don't know how else to put
                  it... I... I had some personal things
                  to work out and... and I have and...
                         (listens, then:)
                  Yeah... Well, the thing is... I want
                  to work again... I want to get back
                  into it... you think that's possible?

        Anne releases her hug -- looking surprised, pleased,
        impressed... she stands by, waiting to ask Jack what's
        up!

                                JACK
                         (to phone)
                  I understand...
                         (obedient)
                  I am... I won't... I will...
                         (beaming)
                  <u>Great</u>!  Thanks a lot, Lou...
                  Tuesday's fine.
                         (listens)
                  Okay... Thanks...

        He hangs up the phone elated... Anne can't wait to
        hear...

                                ANNE
                  So what's going on?  Who's Lou again?

                                JACK
                         (disappointed she doesn't
                          remember)
                  My agent.  I called my agent.

                                ANNE
                  You're kidding!  What did he say?

                                JACK
                  He says if I want to get back to
                  work, no problem.  He wants me to
                  come in and talk and... and... <u>that's</u>
                  <u>it</u>!

                                ANNE
                  <u>Whoah</u>!  Oh, honey, that's terrific!

        She gives him a big hug.  Jack is first to break away.

                                JACK
                         (organizing tapes)
                  I've got to put these tapes in some
                  kind of order... and... Oh, I should
                  get my sports jacket cleaned...
                         (he crosses to the closet)
                  ... There's coffee if you want...

                                ANNE
                  <u>You</u> made coffee?... You're going back
                  to work <u>and</u> you made coffee?... I
                  love this!

        Jack does not respond as he looks through the closet.
        Anne gets her coffee and sits -- watching Jack move about
        so full of energy and focus...

                                ANNE
                         (continuing)
                  It's so great to see you like this,
                  honey... I can't tell you.

                                JACK
                         (looking at jacket)
                  Thanks.

                                ANNE
                         (she smiles and drinks)
                  Ya know, I'm thinkin' -- with another
                  income coming in, I would love to get
                  a bigger place.

        Jack stops organizing for a beat.

                                ANNE
                         (continuing)
                  ... I don't want to rush things --
                  you have to get a job first, but I'm
                  so sure that's gonna happen I'm not
                  even thinking about it.

        Jack brings out his sports jacket, then returns to his
        tapes, hoping he can avoid having to respond.

                                JACK
                  Ugh, these tapes are a mess.  I don't
                  know where to begin...

                                ANNE
                  ... I would love to start looking at
                  least.  You know, maybe a two bedroom
                  or even, maybe the top floor of a
                  house -- like in Brooklyn or Staten
                  Island...

        Jack looks at her, not knowing what to say.

                                ANNE
                         (continuing)
                  ... What?... You don't want to
                  commute?

                                JACK
                  No, it's not... Come here...

        He turns her around and cuddles her up in his arms, with
        her back to him.

                                JACK
                         (continuing)
                  You're an incredible woman Anne...

        Anne breaks away suddenly and looks at him, sternly.

                                JACK
                         (continuing)
                  What?

                                ANNE
                  "I'm an incredible woman?"  What is
                  this, a death sentence?

                                JACK
                  No, I... I think we should talk about
                  this.

                                ANNE
                         (aware and suspicious)
                  You want to talk?  Come on, Jack...
                  Did I cross the line by mentioning
                  the future or what?

                                JACK
                  No... it's just...

        Anne shifts her body to face him directly.

                                JACK
                         (continuing)
                  ... Listen, so much has happened and
                  I think it would be a good thing for
                  both of us if we slowed things down a
                  little.

                                ANNE
                  Slowed things down?  Where have I
                  been?  Have we been going fast!?

                                JACK
                  Right now, I'm just not sure about...
                  making such definite plans.

        Pause.  Anne stares at him like he's speaking Dutch.

                                ANNE
                  I'm lost.  What are you saying?

        Jack sits them both down, takes her hand in his, takes a
        breath:

                                JACK
                  It's been a real... real difficult
                  time for me... The past year or so...
                  And now, for the first time, Anne, I
                  feel like I'm above water.
                  I feel like I know a lot more than I
                  did, and I don't want to make any
                  mistakes so... I think what I need is
                  some time... to make the right
                  choices.  And... I think that
                  maybe... I need to be alone for
                  awhile.

        Anne is speechless -- for the moment.

                                JACK
                  ... I'd like to focus on my career -
                  - now than I can, now that
                  everything's all right... Parry's
                  taken care of... and... Like I said,
                  I feel like I know a lot more now and
                  I don't...

                                ANNE
                         (interrupts)
                  First of all, let me tell you
                  something -- you don't know shit.
                  Second of all, as far as <u>we</u> go, what
                  time do you need?  What have we been
                  doing here, except <u>time</u>?  Have I
                  ever... ever pressured you!?

                                JACK
                  No.

                                ANNE
                  No.  So what time do you need?  I
                  love you -- you love me -- you want
                  to get your career going, great!  I'd
                  like to be a part of it -- I think I
                  deserve that!  So what do you need
                  to figure out alone!?

        Jack doesn't answer.  Pause.  Anne is afraid she knows.

                                ANNE
                         (continuing)
                  All right.  I'm going to ask you one
                  question.
                         (summoning up all her strength)
                  Do you love me?

        Pause.

                                JACK
                  I don't know.

        She slaps him.

                                ANNE
                  You can't even give me that?!  What
                  were you gonna do, Jack?... Just
                  gonna organize your life...
                         (indicates the box)
                  ... walk out that door, move in by
                  yourself and what -- drop the news
                  when you find somebody else?  What
                  were you planning to do, Jack?

                                JACK
                  I didn't know.  I just said all I
                  want is some time.

                                ANNE
                         (fighting back tears)
                  Bullshit!  If you're going to hurt
                  me, you hurt me now -- not some
                  long... drawn out hurt that takes
                  weeks of my life because you don't
                  have the balls!

                                JACK
                         (pause, then:)
                  All right... I'll pack my stuff
                  tonight.

        Anne slaps him again.

                                ANNE
                  What have you been doing here!  <u>Huh</u>!
                  <u>I wanna know</u>!  <u>What have you been</u>
                  <u>doing here</u>?!

                                JACK
                  <u>Listen</u>!  We both got something out of
                  it, all right!

                                ANNE
                  Oh yeah?  What did I get?  What did I
                  get I couldn't've gotten from
                  somebody with no name any night of
                  the week?  You think your company is
                  such a treat?  Your moods, your...
                         (sarcastic)
                  "pain", your problems... You think
                  you're entertaining?

                                JACK
                  Then what do you want to stay with me
                  for?

        ANNE physically attacks him...

                                     ANNE
                   BECAUSE I LOVE YOU!...STUPID!...FUCKIN!...

        JACK blocks her blows and holds her arms. ANNE surrenders to
        her tears. HE is about to embrace her, when she pulls away.

                                     ANNE
                   No....You don't get to be nice now.
                   I'm not gonna play some game with you
                   where we act like friends so you can
                   walk  out  here feeling good about yourself.
                   I'm not a liar. If you're gonna leave me
                   then that's what we call it.

        The phone rings. JACK answers it.

                                     JACK
                   Hello?...Yeah...My wallet? What do you
                   mean?....(his face drops) What?....What?

        INT. HOSPITAL WARD - NIGHT.

        PARRY lays in bed - his face bandaged, his arms in a cast,
        his chest tightly rapped.  HE has been severly beaten. JACK
        and ANNE stand at the foot of the bed in shock. A DOCTOR appears.
        The DOCTOR is young, dedicated and inexperienced enough to
        still feel compassion.

                                     JACK
                   Parry?

                                     DOCTOR
                   He can't hear you.
                      (JACK and ANNE turn)
                   Hi...I'm Dr. Weintraub....
                      (shakes hands)
                   I was on duty when they brought
                   him in...I've been going over his record...
                   He was brought in once before I understand...
                      (reads)
                   ..."catatonic  stupor"...condition  rendered
                   him non-verbal for a period of -...

                                     JACK
                   Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he
                   probably has a concussion or something, right?
                      (DOCTOR doesn't reply)
                   He'll snap out of it?

                                     DOCTOR
                   I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure.
                   The beating's bad but it's not the problem...
                   It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia...
                   So, like before, he could snap out it in an
                   hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years...
                   ....I don't know. There's no way to tell.

                                     JACK
                   But..How could that happen?

                                     DOCTOR
                   Well, it's not unusual in his case...
                   Sometimes victims of tragedies are
                   subject to the brain's replay system.
                   The brain never loses anything - it just
                   stores it up and waits. A person could
                   actually re-experience the full effect
                   of a tragedy, long after the event took place.
                   Are you relatives?
                      (JACK shakes his head)
                   Well, it doesn't matter. We'll take care
                   of it. He'll have to be sent back to
                   the same institution..
                      (HE checks the record)

                                     JACK
                   What if I was a relative?

                                     DOCTOR
                   You'd have the option to care for him at
                   home but my advice is it wouldn't be the
                   best thing for him. He needs hospital
                   care. I just thought you could sign the
                   release forms, but the city can do that.
                   I wouldn't feel responsible in any way.
                   There's really nothing you can do. I'm sorry.

        With that, the DOCTOR EXITS. JACK and ANNE face PARRY.

                                     ANNE
                   Just like a guy. Finds the woman of
                   his dreams then falls into a coma...
                   Poor Lydia...
                      (SHE looks at JACK)
                   ...Some women just have no luck, huh?

        Including herself in this remark, and having cried all she could
        cry, She and JACK exchange one final look. SHE turns and,
        with all her dignity, walks out of the ward. After a BEAT:

                                     JACK
                   Anne....Anne...I'll call you O.k...?

        But ANNE doesn't stop or turn - she keeps walking.
        JACK stares at PARRY. CAMERA MOVES IN TO C.U. - His face
        hardening, a mixture of hurt, rage and resignation.

        SUPER - SIX MONTHS LATER.

        INT. RADIO STUDIO - DAY

        CAMERA PANS the studio as JACK signs off his broadcast:

                                     JACK
                   Well, I'm gone-... Have a perfect
                   weekend and remember on Monday, we
                   have as our studio guest, Ben Starr -
                   star of the recently defunct hit TV show
                   ON THE RADIO - it's the rise and fall
                   story of one of televisions brightest
                   stars ruined by charges of sodomy in
                   an Atlanta airport mens room. If you
                   often wonder, "what IS sodomy exactly?",
                   Ben'll have that answer and many more
                   for you on Monday's show...Until then, don't do
                   anything that will break your pattern
                   of being the selfish scum sucking
                   race you are. From one of the Botched
                   to all of your bungled cats out there,
                   I love ya and right back at cha!. Over and out!

        HE flicks his monitor off as a commercial takes over. The CREW
        work in silence behind him. HE rubs his tired face and sits there.

        CAMERA PAUSES on JACK for a moment as he sits in silence. HE
        looks neither happy nor said, neither satisfied nor unsatisfied.
        HE looks blank...emotionless...as if he knows something is lacking
        but he hasn't the strength or interest to find out....
        THE PHONE RINGS - breaking the silence. JACK picks up.

                                     JACK
                   Yeah...Yeah Lou....
                      (no excitement, no energy until:)
                   Lou, I said I want an offer or they can forget it...
                   Well, tell them I'm meeting with
                   the cable people about a talk show and...What?...
                   Beth's father set it up...No, he owns it.
                   ...Fuck you Lou...And if the network is ready to
                   make an offer and I see a script, then fine...
                   otherwise, forget it...

        HE hangs up.

                                     BETH (OC)
                   Hi...

        JACK turns to see his new improved girlfriend, BETH - a tall,
        statuesque redhead in a smart Chanel outfit. BETH crosses to
        him and they kiss...When they kiss, all the lights in the
        surrounding studios booths go out, as the crew heads home.
        JACK'S STUDIO is now surrounded by blackness...After the kiss,
        JACK gets right to business...

                                     JACK
                   Hi..Did you talk to your father?

                                     BETH
                     (hiding good news)
                   Yeeesss...

                                     JACK
                      (slightly annoyed by her coquettish game)
                   Weeellll!

                                     BETH
                   Well, Daddy said...and this is word for word...
                   He said...that he thought... that you were a home run.

        JACK knows this must mean a great deal - especially to BETH -
        but he just can't get the steam up....HE smiles weakly.

                                     JACK
                   Great.

                                     BETH
                   Really. He thinks you'll be a phenominal
                   success...and he says the cable people
                   are very excited about the meeting...
                   I said I always knew that and I
                   really think it was like the first time
                   he really respected me...So thank you for that.

        JACK nods "it was nothing" as his hands move up her body.

                   Oh and I called him later to thank him but
                   I really think you should send him a note...
                   He wants to take us out to dinner tonight.
                   The car's picking us up at seven...

        JACK nods and watches BETH'S BREASTS pressing against her
        dress.  Turned on, JACK moves to her and begins fondling
        her, as he kisses her neck. BETH giggles.

                                     BETH
                   Jaaack...what are you crazy? They're
                   people all around us?

        JACK flips a switch that send his studio into darkness and
        continues kissing and fondling. BETH giggles some more.

                                     BETH
                   Jaack..I can't do this...

        JACK begins to ease her to the floor. BETH stops him.

                                     BETH
                   What is this thing you have with the floor?

        THEY lower O.C....We hear BETH continue OC:

                                     BETH
                   Oh it's cold...I'm cold...honey...
                   Jack, can we please do this after dinner..
                   in bed?...like normal people?...I really want
                   you but I'll want you more, late. O.K. I promise.

                                                     CUT TO:

        EXT. MIDTOWN OFFICE BUILDING - DAY.

        A STREET BUM, whose face we cannot see, is busy asking
        people for change. But no one is stopping... A SECURITY GUARD
        exits the building and starts yelling at the BUM to leave.
        A CAB pulls up and out steps JACK and LOU. THEY start
        walking toward the building when the BUM recognizes JACK...

                                     BUM
                   JACK!....JACK!....

        JACK turns as the BUM starts for him. Simultaneously, the
        SECURITY GUARD intercepts the BUM, who JACK recognizes as
        the GAY BUM from Central Park...

                                     GAY BUM
                   JACK!...JACK! IT'S MEE...REMEMBER ME...YOU KNOW ME!

                                     GUARD
                   GET OUTTA HERE I SAID!!...

        LOU tries to usher JACK into the building, but JACK stands
        frozen for a moment, as the GUARD pulls out a club and
        starts poking the GAY BUM away...JACK doesn't know what to do...

                                     LOU
                   You KNOW that guy!?
                      (JACK doesn't answer).

                                     GAY BUM
                   JACK...JACK...PLEASE CAN I TALK TO YOU?
                   I JUST..I NEED TO TALK TO YOU, JACK...I...

        But the GUARD keeps at him...JACK realizes people are watching
        him and he enters the building with LOU as the GAY BUM screams:

                                     GAY BUM
                   JACK..PLEASE..JAAAAAACCKKK!!!!
                   JAACCK!...WHY WON'T ANYBODY....WHAT'S THE MATTER...

        But JACK disappears inside. THE GAY BUM is blocked by the GUARD.
        HE throws his arms up and starts muttering to himself helplessly.

                                                     CUT TO:

        INT. OFFICE BUILDING - NETWORK OFFICES - DAY.

        A hyperkenetic T.V. EXEC. is pitching JACK, who sits next to LOU.

                                     T.V. EXEC.
                   It's a weekly comedy about the homeless.

        JACK can't believe his fate. HE looks to a coffee table and
        sees a magazine front page: LANGDON CARMICHAEL BUYS VAN GOGH'S
        ROAD WITH CYPRESSES FOR 20 MILLION DOLLARS.  CAMERA PANS TO C.U.

                   ...But it's not depressing in any way.
                   We want to find a happy, upbeat way of
                   bringing the issue of homeless to television.
                   There are three wacky homeless characters
                   but they're wise...they're wacky and they're wise...
                   And the hooks is, they love being homeless. They
                   love the freedom...they love the adventure...
                   It's all about the joy of living...not all
                   the bullshit we have to deal with...the
                   money, the politics..the pressures...
                   And we're gonna call it HOME FREE...

                                LOU
                  Oooooo... I got a rush...

        Suddenly, Jack stands up and bolts out of the room.

                                TV EXEC
                  What?... Where is he... Lou, is this
                  another disappearing act with this
                  guy or what?

                                LOU
                         (overlapping)
                  I'm sure it's nothing... He probably
                  had to go to the bathroom... I'll
                  find out...

        Jack rushes out of the building to find the Gay Bum, but
        he's gone.

        INT. PARRY'S BASEMENT - DAY

        Jack walks around.  He looks at the wall of weapons and
        the mural of the medieval scene.  He looks through the
        maps, ropes plans for the robbery.  He finds the
        Pinnochio doll still keeping guard before the Red Knight
        wall of scribblings.


        EXT. A LOT BENEATH THE MANHATTAN BRIDGE - DUSK

        Jack approaches the entrance to the lot from the street,
        carrying an open box of assorted deli food and coffee...
        He stops in the entrance and looks at the deserted lot.

        Gone are the little cliques of homeless, once scattered
        throughout the place.  Gone is the magic and danger that
        night cast upon the surroundings.  All Jack sees is
        garbage and decay.

        Suddenly, SIRENS from an ambulance pulls his his attention
        away.  At the same time, the Black and the Irishman (from
        that same first night with Parry), come running out from
        between the two giant foundations of the bridge and bolt
        out of the lot.  Jack smiles in recognition as he moves
        to block them:

                                JACK
                  Hey!  Hey, guys!... Remember me...

        But the Black and the Irishman push him out of the way...

                                BLACK
                  Let me the fuck alone, goddamn it...

                                IRISHMAN
                         (overlapping)
                  Move it, for Christ sakes.
                  <u>Move</u>...!!!

        The Irishman shoves Jack against the fence and runs, with
        the Black close behind.  They disappear underneath the
        highway as Jack turns and sees an ambulance pulling up to
        the sight.  PARAMEDICS wheel a gurney from the ambulance,
        past Jack and into the lot between the giant foundations.
        Jack approaches with great trepidation.  He moves into
        view just in time to see the Paramedics lift the body of
        the Hippy bum onto the stretcher...

                                JACK
                  Hey... <u>Hey</u>... Hey wait, I know him...

        The Paramedics stop... Jack approaches the gurney... The
        Hippy eyes are opened and glazed.

                                JACK
                         (continuing)
                  Hey... hey, remember me... Marvel
                  Comics, right?... Remember Parry...
                  Superbum?  Remember you guys saved my
                  ass...

                                PARAMEDIC
                  Mister, he's dead.

        Jack realizes the glazed eyes are actually dead eyes.
        The Paramedics wheel him away;

        INT. OAKBROOK INSTITUTE - THAT NIGHT

        Jack approaches the nurses' station when he spots a
        familiar face.  Lydia.

        We can see a change in her; the self-consciousness
        replaced by a self assurance, the insecurity replaced
        with a maturity.  She wears a handsome tailored suit.  Jack
        hides from her and listens:

                                LYDIA
                         (to NURSE)
                  Excuse me but I brought new bed
                  sheets for him last week.  They were

                  on them...

                                NURSE
                  Oh yes... I'm sorry.  They're being
                  cleaned.  The doctor had a little
                  accident with a hypo.

                                LYDIA
                  All right... Make sure he gets them,
                  okay.  Thank you.

        Jack watches her exit.


        INT. PARRY'S WARD - NIGHT

        Jack enters a room lined on both side with beds and
        patients.

        The various patients -- all men -- are confined to their
        beds.  Some are mumbling inaudibly to themselves, others
        are rocking back and forth, others just stare off into
        space.  Parry sits in bed -- his eyes are dead, his body
        unresponsive.  Jack stands at the foot of his bed.  Parry
        does not respond.

                                JACK
                  <u>Hi</u>!... It's Jack... How are you
                  doing?... You look good... You do.

        Parry remains the same.  Other patients look at Jack as
        if he's nuts talking to a catatonic person.  Jack moves
        closer to him.  He picks up his hand and holds it.  Then
        shakes it.

                                JACK
                         (continuing)
                  ... Hey... You gonna wake up for me?
                  Huh?...

        No response.  Jack leans closer into him.  His tone
        changes:

                                JACK
                         (continuing)
                  ... This isn't over is it?... You
                  think you're going to make me do
                  this, don't you?...
                         (sternly)
                  Well, forget it!  No fucking way!...
                  I don't feel responsible for you, or
                  for any of them!  Everybody has bad
                  things happen to them... I'm not God.
                  I don't decide... People survive.
                         (beat)
                  Say something!?

        The other patients stop their mumblings and watch, as if
        Jack were an interesting TV show... Jack paces before the
        bed.

                                JACK
                         (continuing)
                  ... Everything's been going great!
                  <u>Great</u>!  I'm... I'm gonna have my own
                  cable talk show, with an incredible
                  equity I might add... I... I... have
                  an... an incredibly gorgeous fucking
                  girlfriend... I... I am living an
                  <u>incredible fucking life</u>!!!... So
                  don't lay there in your comfortable
                  little <u>coma</u> and think I'm about to
                  risk all of that because I feel
                  responsible for you!
                         (to the other patients)
                  <u>I am not responsible</u>!
                         (to Parry)
                  And I don't feel guilty... You've got
                  it easy.
                         (intensely)
                  I'm out there every day.  Every day
                  trying to figure out what the hell
                  I'm doing... why, no matter what I
                  have, it feels like I have nothing...
                  So don't think I feel sorry for you!
                  It's easy being nuts!  Try being
                  me!...
                         (beat)
                  So I won't do this.  I do not believe
                  in this.  And don't give me that
                  stuff about me <u>being the one</u>!  <u>There</u>
                  <u>is nothing</u>... <u>Nothing special about</u>
                  <u>me</u>!  I control my own destiny -- not
                  some overweight fairies.  I say what
                  I'm going to do and <u>I am not risking</u>
                  <u>my life to get some fucking cup for</u>
                  <u>some fucking vegetable</u>...
                   And even if I did do this, I want you
                   to know it wouldn't be because I had to!
                   It wouldn't be 'cause I feel guilty or cursed
                   or .. or...bad or responsible or anything....

    The tears come. JACK gently pushes the hair off of PARRY'S face.

                                     JACK
                          (continuing)
                   Aw shit...If I do this...and I mean, IF!...
                   It's because I want to do this...
                   for you.  That's all!!  For you!
                          (HE kisses PARRY'S forehead)
                   Don't go anywhere...huh?

                                                     CUT TO:

        EXT. CARMICHAEL TOWNHOUSE - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

        JACK stands on the deserted block. HE looks around at the
        neighboring houses - all the New Yorkers safely locked away
        behind their doors, intentionally oblivious to what goes on
        around them. JACK is holding a rope with a self-made hook. HE
        looks up the at building, takes a gulp, then throws the rope up.  
        IT MISSES and falls back toward him - scaring him to the side
        and making an awful sound when it lands. JACK tries again.
        IT CATCHES. HE tugs a bit. HE begins to climb up the building.

                                     JACK
                   Thank God I live in a city where nobody
                   looks up...

        HE places a foot on the wall and begins to climb, mumbling:

                                     JACK
                   What the hell am I doing? Can't fuckin believe
                   this is my life! ...(imitates a whiny Parry)...
                   "Oh Jack you're the one...we have to get the Grail"
                   I'll give ya Grail, ya stupid dingbat!
                   Climbing up walls in the middle of the goddamn city-
                   in the middle of the goddamn night while that
                   schmuck lays in bed dreaming about Camelot!
                   I live through this and I'll be the
                   King of the Idiots...What a fucking honor!

        HE pulls and steps, pulls and steps...climbing up to a BALCONY
        mid-way between the street and the roof. JACK climbs over, falling
        into some exterior lighting that lines the balcony.

        A light is jarred loose, falling to the ground making an
        awful SOUND and lighting a stained glass window. JACK raises his
        eyes and sees THE RED KNIGHT standing six feet tall, as pictured
        in the design of the stained glass window. HE stares until
        HE HEARS THE SOUND OF A HORSE GALLOPING....HE freezes, then
        cautiously looks toward the street - but the street
        is vacant. The galloping stops. An eerie silence hangs in the air.

                                     JACK
                   Oh great. This is great. I'm hearing
                   horses now. Parry will be so pleased.
                       (HE picks up the rope and
                        throws it to the roof)
                   RADIO PERSONALITY TURNS SCREWBALL
                   ON MISSION FROM GOD...I just hope
                   when they put me away they find me
                   a bed right next to his!

        HE begins to climbs from the balcony to the roof....Suddenly,
        JACK hears SIREN IN THE DISTANCE and freezes, closing his eyes.

        SUDDENLY, THREE POLICE CARS come barrelling down the street -
        sirens blasting, they screech to a halt. A dozen cops hit the
        streets with rifles and spotlights aimed at JACK. A REPORTER
        faces a news camera. (THE SAME REPORTER FROM EDWIN'S T.V.
        NEWS REPORT)

                                     REPORTER
                   A crazed radio personality dangles from
                   the townhouse of billionaire...

        ANNE jumps out of a police car and runs to the townhouse -
        her face full of love and concern.

                                     ANNE
                   Jack!

        JACK OPENS HIS EYES:

        POV - The street is empty. The siren was from an ambulance
        that drives off in the distance. There are no cops, no
        spotlights...and no Anne.

                                JACK
                         (quietly)
                  Anne.

        A ball of sweat, he takes a breath and continues his
        climb.

                                                   CUT TO:


        EXT. CARMICHAEL TOWNHOUSE - ROOF - NIGHT

        Jack reaches the roof and climbs over.  He pulls the rope
        up and quickly moves to the skylight.  He looks down into
        it and sees a dark void.  He takes a breath and pulls out
        some masking tape.   He makes three big tape loops and
        applies them to the glass.  He then takes out a glass
        cutter and begins to cut a pane.  The SOUND, at first, is
        starting.  An O.S. VOICE says:

                                VOICE
                  You're being too loud.

        Jack's heart stops.  He looks into the darkness of the
        roof but sees nothing.  He tries to slow down his heart
        and shake away thoughts of demons in the dark.  He
        continues cutting.  When he finishes the entire pane, he
        replaces the cutter in his pocket then plasters his arm
        against the tape.  He gently bangs the pane and it comes
        loose, sticking to the tape.  He is impressed.  He places
        the pane on the roof and, fastening one end of the rope
        to a pipe, lowers the other end down.

                                                   CUT TO:


        INT. CARMICHAEL TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

        Jack eases himself down into a pitch black room.  But the
        rope doesn't reach the floor.  He dangles for a moment,
        fearful of falling until he realizes it is the only way
        to get down.  He takes a breath and releases, falling to
        the floor with a THUD!... The room is dark.  The moon-
        light barely illuminates the austere, castle-like
        surroundings.  Jack pulls out the page from the
        Architecture Today and lights a lighter.  The "Grail" is
        in the library on the first floor.  Jack cautiously makes
        his way out.


        INT. FIFTH FLOOR HALLWAY OF TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

        Jack looks down the dark hallway.  At the far end he can
        see the top of a staircase. He heads towards it until he
        sees something that makes him stop dead in his tracks.

        Slowly, a shadow holding a shotgun emerges up the stairs
        against the back wall... Jack is paralyzed.  He closes
        his eyes.  The shadow reaches the top of the landing.  It
        is EDWIN MALNICK... Wearing the same expression we saw on
        the TV broadcast -- sad and harmless.  Jack's heart is
        bursting out of his chest.  Edwin calmly raises the gun,
        cocks it and FIRES:  the shot BLASTS down the hallway,
        deafening Jack.  But when he opens his eyes to see if he
        has been hit, there is no blood, no wound... and when he
        looks up, no Edwin.  He pulls himself together and
        continues:

                                                   CUT TO:


        INT. FIRST FLOOR OF TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

        Jack enters Carmichael's library carefully.  A small lamp
        is lit on a small table beside a large Chesterfield
        chair, which is turned facing the fireplace.  Jack spots
        the antique commode and crosses to it... Within the
        commode, sitting innocently behind two small glass doors,
        is the "Grail"... Jack gently opens the doors and takes
        out the goblet.  He holds it reverently for a moment,
        then, noticing an inscription, reads:

                       TO LITTLE LANNIE CARMICHAEL
         FOR ALL HIS HARD WORK... P.S. 247 CHRISTMAS PAGENT 1932

        Jack can't help but smile.  He takes the chalice and
        turns to leave, when suddenly he notices:

        The bare foot of a man barely sticking out from in front
        of the Chesterfield chair.  Jack slowly moves around the
        large back of the chair to the front and sees, to his
        amazement:  LANGSTON CARMICHAEL, wearing only his silk
        pajama bottoms, asleep in the chair.  On the table beside
        him is an empty bottle of vodka and an empty bottle of
        pills.

        Jack doesn't know what to do, when it suddenly strikes
        him that Carmichael hasn't moved at all.  At first, he
        thinks it is another hallucination, but then he notices
        the pill bottle.  He takes a step toward it, the floor
        SQUEAKING beneath him but Carmichael remaining
        unconscious.  He reads the bottle:  Seconal.  Jack looks
        at Carmichael's limp body and checks his heart.  It is
        very faint. Scared, Jack slowly starts backing out of
        the room.

                                                   CUT TO:


        INT. FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

        Jack is panicked.  He wants to run away.  He looks to the
        front entrance and sees an alarm system indicated by a
        tiny beam of light that sits a few inches above the
        floor.  Suddenly, Jack feels calm.  He has an idea.  He
        knows what he is going to do.

                                                   CUT TO:


        EXT. CARMICHAEL TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

        Jack exits out the front door, setting off a slight BUZZ
        from the alarm.  He checks to see that no one is around,
        then quickly runs down the street.

                                                   CUT TO:


        INT. PARRY'S WARD - NIGHT

        Parry lies asleep in a sea of lime green and watermelons.
        Jack places the "Grail" in Parry's lifeless hands.  He
        pulls up a chair beside the bed and sits.

                                JACK
                  Okay... I did my side of the
                  bargain... You gonna wake up now?
                  Huh?...
                         (no response)
                  Want to think about it a little
                  more...?  Okay.

        Jack props his feet up on Parry's bed and settles in to
        sleep.

                                                   CUT TO:


        INT. PARRY'S WARD - DAWN

        CAMERA CLOSE on a newspaper headline being read by an
        orderly:  "ACCIDENTAL SUICIDE THWARTED BY NIGHT
        PROWLER... Thief Didn't Know Anyone Was Home, Escapes
        Empty Handed"... CAMERA PANS PAST several beds until it
        ARRIVES at Parry's.  Jack is asleep in a chair beside
        him.  CAMERA ON Parry's hands as they gently come to life
        and grasp the chalice.  Parry opens his eyes, raising the
        chalice to him.  He sees Jack sleeping beside him and
        smiles.

                                PARRY
                         (whispers)
                  I had this dream, Jack.

        Jack remains asleep.

                                PARRY
                         (continuing)
                  I was married.  I was married to this
                  beautiful woman.... And you were there
                  too...
                         (pause)
                  I really miss her, Jack.  Is that
                  okay?  Can I miss her now?

        Jack, his eyes closed, only pretends to be asleep, but in
        truth he hears every word.  A tear rolls down his cheek.
        Parry extends one hand, placing it on Jack's shoulder
        while cradling the chalice with the other.

        INT. OAKBROOK INSTITUTE - DAY

        Lydia makes her way down the corridor, pushing her way
        through the swinging doors into Parry's ward.  She is
        stopped in her tracks by what she sees:

        Parry has gathered all the patients to the center of the
        room, and is teaching them to sing "Groovin'".  Jack
        is watching.  Although most are not getting it, all are
        having a good time.  When one of the patients turns to
        look at Lydia, Parry turns as well... His face lights up
        as he says:

                                PARRY
                  Hiya, sweetheart!  Where you been!?

        Lydia loses control and begins to cry through her smile.
        Parry approaches and wraps his arms around her.

                                PARRY
                         (continuing)
                  Don't cry... Hey...

        Lydia throws her arms around him.

                                PARRY
                         (continuing)
                  ... Are you my girl?... Are you my
                  girl...?

        Lydia sobs and nods in his shoulder.  Parry holds her
        tighter.

        INT. VIDEO POP - DAY.

        ANNE sits in her office, a cigarette dangling from her mouth,
        going over receipts. There is a knock at the door. A beat of
        silence. ANNE raises her head to discover JACK, holding a
        bouquet of flowers. HE smiles. ANNE looks shocked, then -
        pulling herself together...THEY both are frozen in silence:

                                     ANNE
                   Well!  What do you want me to do -
                   applaud?

                                     JACK
                   How have you been?

                                     ANNE
                      (coldly)
                   Terrific. Going on alot of dates ...
                   seeing lots of men... lots of dates..

        JACK nods.  HE is uncharacteristically nervous.

                                     ANNE
                      (sincere, vulnerable)
                   Jack please...I'm having a bad month.
                   I'm not up to this. What are you doing here?

        HE takes a breath, looks at ANNE and pushes the words out of him.

                                     JACK
                   I love you.

        For once, ANNE is speechless. She slowly rises from behind her
        desk in such a way that JACK takes a step back in fear. ANNE
        up to him. She has no intention of making this easy.

                                     ANNE
                   Excuse me, I didn't get all that...
                   Won't you run it by me again.

        JACK is dying. HE could hardly say it the first time.

                                     JACK
                   I think..(quickly corrects himself)
                   I...I realized...I love you.

                                     ANNE
                   Huh-huh....You son of a bitch!

        SHE hauls off and cracks him a slap across the face
        that stuns him - his knees giving out, lowering him to the floor.
        SHE quickly grabs his face with her hands and plants a passionate
        kiss on his lips, that slowly causes him to rise back up. HE drops
        the flowers and grabs her. SHE mounts his body and begin to undo his
        suit. THEY go at it with such passion, they both fall to the floor.

                                     ANNE (O.C.)
                   Jesus. What rock hit YOU in the head?

        EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT.

        CAMERA PANS DOWN PARRY and JACK, lying naked, cloudbusting.

                                     PARRY
                   Beautiful night huh?

                                     JACK
                   Yeah.....Hey they're moving....
                      (pause)
                   Am I doing that?



                                     <u>THE END</u>
