<b>          1 EXT. MANHATTAN. BROADWAY. UPPER 70S. DAY. 1
</b>
          From across Broadway we see a little girl waiting at the
          curb. She steps off the curb toward us --
          A TRUCK BARRELS into frame -- The long lens' flattened
          perspective makes it look like she's just been crushed. But
          the truck flashes by and she's fine. More traffic passes to
          and fro through the frame.

<b>          CREDITS BEGIN OVER:
</b>
<b>          2 EXT. ANOTHER CORNER. DAY. 2
</b>
          The LIGHT CHANGES and a crowded corner full of New Yorkers
          step off the curb and into the crosswalk -- Before the first
          foot lands on the street we go to SUPER SLOW MOTION as the
          mid-day work crowd crosses the street.

<b>          3 EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS. DAY. 3
</b>
          MONTAGE -- Slow motion shots of New Yorkers, mid-day, all
          kinds, going all different ways, all over the city.
          CREDITS END with some high school kids with book bags,
          walking among the crowds.

<b>          4 INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM. DAY. 4
</b>
          An 11th-grade math class at the Ralph Waldo Emerson School,
          one of the few remaining Manhattan '60s-inspired progressive
          schools. About twenty kids, mostly white secular Jewish. A
          sprinkling of black and Hispanic kids.
          The teacher, MR AARON, late 20s, is returning test papers.

<b>                         MR AARON
</b>          Abrams... Allende...
          One after the other the students get up to collect their
          tests, glance at the results and drag themselves back to
          their chairs.
          On LISA COHEN, just 17. Not the best-looking girl in her
          class but definitely in the top five. She listens listlessly,
          somewhat bad-temperedly.

<b>          MR AARON (CONT'D)
</b>          Bernstein... Cohen...
          At "Cohen" LISA gets up and heads for the desk.
          LISA'S POV, closing in slowly on MR AARON who glances up at
          her as she approaches. Their eyes meet. Aaron has the classic
          handsome young teacher's no-nonsense expression on his face
          as she reaches out her hand --

                         

                         

                         

                         
<b>           2
</b>
<b>                         4 CONTINUED: 4
</b>
<b>                         LISA
</b>          Thank you, Mr Aaron.
          She walks back. On her test he's written: B- "SEE ME1"

<b>          5 INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM. DAY. LATER. 5
</b>
          AFTER CLASS -- The last students go out as Mr Aaron gestures
          for Lisa to take a seat.

<b>                         MR AARON
</b>          Take a seat, Lisa. I just wanna talk about
          your test for a minute.

<b>                         LISA
</b>
<b>                         (SITTING)
</b>          Sure.

<b>                         MR AARON
</b>          Now...I know you had a little help...

<b>                         LISA
</b>          Well -- I mean -- I didn't cheat, if that's
          what you mean.

<b>                         MR AARON
</b>          I'm just saying I know you had a little
          help.

<b>                         LISA
</b>          A lot of people did.

<b>                         MR AARON
</b>          Be that as it may --

<b>                         LISA
</b>          I mean I'll take it over again if you want,
          but like, what would be the point?
          It's not like I'm ever gonna actually need
          to know this stuff in my daily life...

<b>                         MR AARON
</b>          Well, Lisa, that's just not necessarily
          true. Haven't you ever developed an 
          interest in something you didn't initially
          think you were going to develop an interest
          in?

<b>                         LISA
</b>          Um, no, not really.

                          
          Mr Aaron looks down for a moment to hide his amusement. Lisa
          looks at him with secret adoration. He looks up.

<b>                         5 CONTINUED: 5
</b>
<b>                         LISA (CONT'D)
</b>          Anyway, it was open book. So what's the big
          difference-between using a book and like, I
          don't know, using somebody else's mind
          who's like, really good at math? It's not
          like this person did the whole test for me.

<b>                         MR AARON
</b>          Oh no?

<b>                         LISA
</b>          No. I did some of it.
          She smiles at him. He is no longer smiling back.

<b>                         MR AARON
</b>          Well, next time I'd appreciate it if you
          did all of it. OK?

<b>                         LISA
</b>          You are so fair.

<b>          6 INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY. DAY. 6
</b>
          TRACKING LISA from behind as she walks through the halls past
          her fellow students. She walks through a door --

<b>          7 EXT. ALLEY. DAY -- CONTINUOUS. 7
</b>
          -- where kids are smoking. Lots of butts on the ground. The
          walls covered with graffiti. Lisa goes to her friend BECKY 
          and takes out her cigarettes. A kid named KURT smokes nearby.

<b>                         BECKY
</b>          What did he say to you?

<b>                         LISA
</b>          Nothing. . .Mr Aaron and I have an
          understanding about my math problem.
          Becky laughs. Lisa laughs.

<b>                         LISA (CONT'D)
</b>          He is so appealing.
          A long-haired kid comes out, followed by a somewhat preppier
          girl, KIRSTEN, and her look-alike friend LESLIE.

<b>                         KIRSTEN
</b>          OK, Mr Ferrar is such an asshole.

<b>                         KURT
</b>          What'd he do, call on you?

<b>                         KIRSTEN
</b>          Fuck you., Kurt.

                         

                         

                         

                         
<b>           4

<b>                         7 CONTINUED: 7
</b>
<b>                         LESLIE
</b>          Kirsten is really upset.

<b>                         KURT
</b>          I'm sorry.

<b>                         KIRSTEN
</b>
<b>                         (TO LESLIE)
</b>          Let me have one of those, will you?
          Leslie gives Kirsten a cigarette and lights it for her.

<b>                         BECKY
</b>          Kirsten, I didn't know you smoked.

<b>                         KIRSTEN
</b>          I don't. -I'm just really angry. (to Leslie)
           Check out what he. said to me last week.
          She drops her voice. They whisper and then both laugh. Lisa
          watches them.

<b>                         LESLIE
</b>          Are you serious?
          Lisa overhears MONICA, an elegant 12th-grader, talking to
          some other girls seated on the steps.

<b>                         MONICA
</b>          .I just don't think you can really know a
          guy until you've slept with him.
          Lisa, listening, is not so sure, but wouldn't know.

<b>          8 INT. AMERICAN HISTORY CLASS. DAY. 8
</b>
           The class is taught by two teachers; MR KLEIN, 50s, and MR 
          LEWIS, 30s. On the blackboard are scrawled the words 
          "STRIKERS" "PINKERTONS" and "PREZ. McKINLEY."

<b>                         KLEIN 
</b>          .So the President of the United States,
          William B. McKinley, authorized the use of
          private detectives to break the strike, and
          they went out there and shot them down!
          Just like they did in Virginia, just like
          they did in Pennsylvania. Because they did
          not care! They did not care!

<b>                         LEWIS
</b>          (low, rumbling)
          And that's basically it-That's basically

</b>          Can I just say, I'm not necessarily like a
          big fan of all the Presidents of the United
          States, especially the current one, but I
          still don't think its necessarily all that
          useful to categorize every President as
          universally corrupt, because that just
          seems very general to me. Especially if
          you're going to judge them by the standard
          of -- whatever they're supposed to
          traditionally be like in some mythical
          version of America that probably never
          existed to begin with.

          would be right to appear on horseback in

          out from under the bus.
          Then with some confusion, she realizes that Monica herself is
          right in front of her, and that her blood is spreading
          everywhere. Monica is reaching out vaguely, unable to speak.
          She is making choking sounds.
          Lisa stands over her for a second, frozen. She crouches down
          and tries to do something but doesn't know what to do, where
          to put her hands. Other people start converging.
          IN THE BUS -- The Bus Driver puts the bus in Park, opens the
          door and rushes out.
          WE TRACK him as he comes around to where a crowd has already
          formed. He hangs back on the outside, but we break through
          till we find LISA kneeling next to the disoriented MONICA,
          holding her hand. They are both covered in blood. Several
          other people are shouting and talking all at once.

          you see the traffic light? (Pause) Could
          you see if it was red? Green? Yellow? Just
          picture it in your mind. What color was the
          light?
          Lisa looks over at the Bus Driver. He looks back at her.

</b>          I guess it was green? I didn't really see 
          it. I think it was just an accident.

                          
          Behind the Bus Driver somebody moves from where they were,
          and Lisa gets a clear view of the woman's covered body.

          The room feels small and distorted. Odd. She starts to take
          off her blood-soaked jacket, but her purse is over her

          She sits on the bed and then gets up and looks at where she
          sat. There's an imprint of blood on the white bedspread.

          She kneels down next to the toilet and opens it. She waits.
          She throws up into the toilet. Joan knocks on the door.

</b>          I grew up five years in Panama, four years
          in Holland, then nine years in Paris. After
          I finish university, I moved back to
          Colombia. So: when I'm speaking French,
          they think I'm Spanish. When I'm speaking
          Spanish, they think I'm french.

<b>                         JOAN

<b>                         RAMON
</b>          I have a company: We design computer
          software to help companies in South
          American countries.that use an incompatible
          software, so the computers can't talk to
          each other. It's a big problem in Central
          and South America, where there is not
          usually so much coordination in computer
          communications. So right now there's a big
          opportunity for us, because for the big
          software companies it's still in the
          backwoods. That's changing already, but in
          the last ten years we have done extremely
          well. It's the next ten years we're going
          to see what happens.

<b>                         LISA
</b>          Nothing at all! Why are you pushing this? I
          don't want to go to the opera!

<b>                         JOAN
</b>          Yes! OK! It's called an invitation. I'm not
          pushing anything! All you have say is "No
          thanks!"

<b>                         LISA
</b>          I did! And then you were like, "Why not?"
          So then I told you, and then you started
          like, debating me! Like you assume I've 
          never thought this through for myself!
          Which I have! Many times!

<b>                         JOAN
</b>          OK, well, that was a really Contemptuous
          assumption on my part. I don't actually
          like the opera that much myself. But I'm
          trying to expand my mind. Maybe that's
          wrong! (Pause) I'm sorry. I guess I'm a
           little nervous about you guys meeting
          Ramon. 

<b>                          LISA 
</b>          Why? What's the big deal? Why are you so
          influenced by what me and Curtis think?
          What Curtis and I think.

<b>                         JOAN
</b>          Because obviously if I'm seeing somebody
          new it would important to me that you guys
          would like him and that he like you. Why
          wouldn't I be nervous about that?

          think it's worth it: I usually get nervous
          because I can't help the way I feel.
          Although I do think that if anything is
          worth getting nervous about, it's this. But
          maybe that's just really idealistic of me.

</b>          Yes. I prefer not to put too many chemicals
          inside my body if I can avoid it. I'm sure
          it's fine...Or not...!

</b>          Try to listen to me. Right about now is
          when you're traditionally supposed to freak
          out. So why don't you just not? You're not
          gonna get AIDS, because I don't have AIDS --

<b>                         PAUL
</b>          No, but I'm pretty sure I don't have it,
          because of my demographic. And the odds are
          you're probably not gonna have to have an
          abortion either. And since this was your
          first time, it might as well be a basically
          happy memory instead of a shitty one.

<b>                         LISA
</b>          I'm sorry. I'm not completely in control of
          my emotions. (Pause) Anyway...Thank you for
          deflowering me.

</b>          Well, it's the plural.

</b>          I know --

<b>                         RAMON
</b>          It's the plural of "bravo." It's what they

</b>          No, I know, I know it's correct, it just --
          don't you think there was something a

          arrangements! And I gotta tell you people,
          I didn't have any kind of relationship with

          the fact that she held up my children's
          inheritance for fifteen years. I guess

          Morrison, who was Monica's friend and is
          the person who has been dealing with all of

</b>          Well-thank you all for coming.

</b>          Thank you for doing this, Emily.

<b>                         THE MOURNERS
</b>          Yes, thank you, Emily.

<b>                         EMILY
</b>          As you all know, Monica was not a religious
          woman. Anybody who ever had to sit through
          a wedding or a funeral with her knows how
          she felt about formal occasions. So Harry
          and Elise and I, when we were talking about
          this, decided we would just have everyone
          over and let.anyone who wanted to.talk.
          about Monica just talk about her. Maybe
          share some remembrances of her. Some of us
          know each other, some of us don't. But
          we're all here because we loved Monica.
          (She stops. Gets a hold of herself) And 
          because we want to pay tribute to her in a
          way that might conceivably not enrage her.
          Everyone laughs slightly.

<b>                         EMILY (CONT'D)
</b>          I don't want to tell anyone what to think,
          or how to feel. And I don't want to kid
          myself about the stupid, meaningless way
          she died, because it would really make her
          throw up. But I don't want it to become the
          summation of her life. Because it's not.
          When her Lisa died I said to her, "How can
          you stand it?" And she said. "First of all
          I can't. But I don't want to take away the
          twelve years she did have, and turn them
          all into leukemia. Because they weren't."
          So despite the fact that she got -- ripped
          off, I do think it's important to remember
          that Monica got a lot out of life. She was
          the most fully developed person I
          personally have ever known. She was also
          impossible to get along with, but that's
          another story.
          Everybody laughs. 

<b>                          EMILY (CONT'D)
</b>          As most of you know, she had more than her
          share of trouble over the years. But that
          never diminished her compassion or stopped
          her from embracing life to the absolute
          fullest -- measure.

          I want to talk a little bit about the first
          time we met. She was twenty one.

           Lisa is on the phone.- The Times article about the accident is 

                          
           on her bed. O.C. we hear Curtis practicing his scales.

<b>                          LISA 
</b>           No -- M A R E T T I .. What about 
           Brooklyn? . Thank you. 

                          
           She writes down the number and hangs up. Looks at the number.

                          
          Dials the phone. It rings once. She hangs up.

          Lisa is very disengaged from the discussion. John is walking
          back and forth, reading aloud from King Lear.

<b>                         JOHN

<b>                         (READING)

          boys. They kill us for their sport."
          (Pause) We are to the gods as flies to
          wanton boys. They kill us for their sport."
          What do you make of that? Lisa? Lisa?

<b>                         LISA
</b>          I don't know.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          Take a stab. What do you think Shakespeare
          is saying about human suffering here?

<b>                         LISA
</b>          I don't know. Sorry.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          You know what, Lisa? That's not good
          enough. That's not good enough.
          Shakespeare wrote something: What's your
          response? And don't tell me you don't have
          one because I don't buy it.

<b>                         LISA
</b>          I don't really have a lot to say. It seems
          pretty self-evident to me.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          (Pause. Then:)
          Matthew?

<b>                         MATTHEW
</b>          I think it is self-evident. I think he's
          saying that human beings don't mean any
          more to the gods than flies do to little
          boys who like to torture them for fun.

<b>                         MATTHEW (CONT'D)
</b>          Like as far as the gods are concerned we're
          just ants. Nothing. (like a newscaster
          turning to his colleague) Darren?
          The class laughs.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          (responding in kind)
          Thank you, Matthew. Yeah, I agree. Only
          it's not Shakespeare saying it: It's
          Gloucester. Maybe another character would
          have a different point of view.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          OK: That's a valid point. Just because
          Shakespeare has one of his characters say
          it doesn't mean he personally agrees with
          it. Yes: David?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          Yeah, maybe Shakespeare isn't saying the
          gods don't care about us. Maybe he's saying
          there's a higher consciousness that we
          can't see. That the gods' perception of
          reality is so much more developed than ours
          that compared to their perception, our
          perceptions are like comparing flies to

<b>                         BOYS
</b>
<b>                         JOHN
</b>          OK...I don't think that's what he's getting
          at...I think what he's getting at here is a
          very dark view of the arbitrary nature of
          human suffering.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          But maybe he's not. Maybe he's comparing
          human consciousness to divine
          consciousness, and he's saying that even
          though it seems to us that human suffering
          is just arbitrary, that's just because
          we're limited by our viewpoint. 

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          Well -- let's look at the text. Let's test
          David's hypothesis. "We are to the gods as
          flies to wanton boys. They kill us for
          their sport." I have to agree with Matthew,
          that seems pretty unambiguous.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          Yeah, because he's saying there's a higher
          purpose that we can't see. He's saying that
          what seems like them killing us for sport
          could just be because our consciousness
          isn't developed enough to see what the
          higher wisdom of their killing us is.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          OK, but -- I still don't think that's what
          he's trying to say. Um...

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          No, like if you say they kill us for their
          sport, when our perception of the gods is
          so meager that we can't even tell what
          they're doing, then how can we be so
          arrogant as to think that they would bother
          to kill us for their sport?

<b>                         JOHN
</b>
<b>                         (LOST)
</b>          I don't know ...Um -- Monica?

<b>                         MONICA
</b>          I don't think that's what he's saying at
          all. I think he's saying the gods don't
          give a shit about human beings and they
          just kill and torture us for fun --

<b>                         MATTHEW
</b>          Yes. Much like flies to wanton boys.
          Anybody? Anybody?

<b>                         MONICA
</b>          Yeah...1

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          But if the gods' consciousness is so much
          more developed than ours that we seem like
          flies to them, then how can we be sure what
          they have in mind for us or why they do
          anything?

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          David, I think you've made your point.
          But it's not what Shakespeare meant.
          Scholarly opinion is pretty consistent that
          he's trying to say something about
          human suffering here --

</b>          Scholarly opinion...:

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          And in this particular play what I think
          he's trying to say is pretty black --
          pretty bleak --

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          But what are you saying? A thousand
          Frenchmen can't be wrong?

          like to move on --

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          I think he is saying that, because he's
          comparing human consciousness to flies, and
          he's saying that we can't see the truth
          around us because our consciousness is
          undeveloped.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          No David, that's not what Shakespeare
          meant! He says it somewhere else in the
          play, but I don't want to get hung up on
          this any more because it's not what
          Shakespeare meant, and I would really like
           to move on.

          you didn't. So then I called her, and she

           Lisa puts a new cowboy hat in her luggage. She tries to zip
           the bag but it won't zip. (This is a dream)

          Lisa is asleep. The room is dark. She stirs. She realizes
          JOAN is sitting on the edge of her bed, her back to Lisa.

          show? What time is it?.
          Joan starts coughing. Blood starts coming out with every
          cough, first a little, then a gruesome amount --
          LISA WAKES UP -- breathing hard short breaths. The room is
          dark and quiet. She calms down and gets up.

          She comes in without turning on the light. She turns on the
          faucet. In the dim bathroom the water looks strangely dark.
          She switches on the light --
          BLOOD is streaming out the faucet and filling the basin.
          She looks up. MONICA the dead woman is standing behind her in

          Lisa wakes up sharply, breathing hard, drenched in sweat.

          Lisa turns the unfamiliar corner. Little kids play in the

          Lisa follows Mrs Maretti into the small apartment. O.C. we
          HEAR two small BOYS running around and shouting. MARETTI is
          watching TV. Mrs Maretti goes over and speaks to him, low. He
          sees LISA and slowly gets up.

           to stand around here tryin' to figure out 
           what you're doin' here! (Pause) What! What! 
          What! What!

<b>                         LISA
</b>          All right! Well...the way I remember the
          accident is that you were wearing this
          cowboy hat --

<b>                         MARETTI
</b>          Yes, it's my cowboy hat that I wear
          sometimes to amuse myself on the bus, yes.
          I was probably wearing my cowboy hat, yes.
          What.

<b>                         LISA
</b>          If you could just let me...! From my point
          of view, I was out that day trying to buy a
          cowboy hat, so I was waving at you, becase 
          I was looking for one... and you were kind 
          of waving back...And I know the police 
          already decided it was No Fault, or No
          Criminality or whatever they call it --

<b>                         MARETTI
</b>          No Criminality, that's right.

<b>                         LISA
</b>          -- I guess partly because of what I told
          them. And I know I was distracting you,
          but -- I did see the bus go through the red 
          light. And that's when it hit that woman.

<b>                         MARETTI
</b>          OK. I'm gettin' a little confused over 
          here.

<b>                         LISA
</b>          Only nobody said that to them. And I just
          wanted to like, acknowledge with you that
          that's what happened.

<b>                         MARETTI
</b>          OK. First of all, I don't really know what
          you mean by wavin' at you...What were you,
          tryin' to catch the bus...?

          me in trouble. Uhhhh, there's no 
          criminality found...the report is, uh,
          final. And that's it.

<b>                         LISA
</b>          So you're just gonna leave it?

<b>                         MARETTI
</b>          I'm gonna leave it, because that's all that
          it was. If something else would have
          happened, I'd take it to whatever that was.
          It was tragic, it was a tragedy. But
          there's only a certain speed the brakes can
          react. That's a physical limitation of the
          machine. I don't know what else to tell
          you. It was a shock. It's shock. But 
          that's it. Can't bring her back. Cannot
          bring her back.

          to get in trouble, but.--

<b>                         MARETTI

          happened -- it seemed like you were kind of
          looking at me -- like we were saying to

</b>          So now you're sayin' he ran the light. 

<b>                         LISA
</b>          Yes. He wasn't even looking at the road.
          And I was definitely trying to get his
          attention...

<b>                         MITCHELL
</b>          No, I get the picture. So you're flirtin'
          with this guy, he's wavin' at you, he runs
          the light, hits the decedent, she dies on
          the scene...the both of youse lie to me on
          both of your statements, and then
          somewheres in there you turn around, decide
          the guy belongs in jail. That right? That
          about right?

<b>                         LISA
</b>          I don't have any control over if he goes to
          jail or not. I certainly have my hopes. I
          just want to set the record straight, so
          that if he gets away with this I won't have
          been a part of it.

<b>                         MITCHELL
</b>          And what do you think I should do with you?
          Just gimmeâ€¢a clue. 'cause I'm just a little
          bit lost over here...:

<b>                         LISA
</b>          Do whatever you want. I know what I did. 

<b>                         MITCHELL
</b>          OK. Well. Before we do anything, Lisa,
          anybody will tell you that just because he
          ran a red light is not a criminal offence. 

<b>                         LISA
</b>          Even if he kills someone?

<b>                         MITCHELL
</b>
<b>                         (SIMULTANEOUS) 
</b>          Even if you cause an accidental death, 
          that's right. For this to be a criminal
          offense, the law says you need two 
          aggravating circumstances. Like he ran a red
          light and he was speeding. Or he ran a red
          light and he was --

<b>                         LISA
</b>          (On 2nd "red")
          So he's not liable to be prosecuted for
          manslaughter? Or second degree murder?

<b>                         MITCHELL
</b>          No. He could be charged with reckless
          driving, and fillip' out a false police
          report. Which, that's no joke --

<b>                         LISA
</b>          That's unbelievable! What does he have to
          do? Kill her on purpose?

<b>                         MITCHELL
</b>          Yes. Because that's the definition of
          murder. Killin' somebody on purpose.
          You're not sayin' he ran her over on
          purpose, are you?
          Pause.

<b>                         LISA
</b>          No.
          Pause.

<b>                         MITCHELL

          statement, and, uh...We'11 look into it,

          .Yeah, because the Central Park

          about five hundred miles worth of these 
          cheap shitty-looking fences all over the

          He's a terrific lawyer and if he doesn't
          know what to do himself he'll certainly
          know someone we can talk to.

</b>          When someone is killed it's what you call a
          Wrongful Death Suit, which is a statutory
          case, which just means there's a statute
          passed by the legislature which gives you
          the right to bring the case.

<b>                         LISA
</b>          As opposed to what?

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          As opposed to common law, which is law made
          by judges. Which is why the damages are
          limited.

<b>                         LISA

          about that.

<b>                         LISA

          again.

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          I'm just telling you that even if they do,
          there is no way in this world they are
          gonna recommend to the DA that they charge
          this guy. That's why --

<b>                          DAVE EMILY

<b>                          DAVE
</b>           I'm just getting to that. You can't
           do anything unless you're a relative --

<b>                          EMILY
</b>           She didn't have any relatives, except for 
           those idiots in Arizona --

<b>                          DAVE
</b>
<b>                          (ON "EXCEPT")
</b>           -- or -- hang on a minute -- unless you're
           executor of her estate --

<b>                         EMILY
</b>          I am the executor of her estate.

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          -- which is Emily. I know.

<b>                         EMILY
</b>          So good.

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          Yes. This is good. Because the executor of
          the estate Cdn bring a Wrongful Death suit,
          but the beneficiary has to be a relative.
          So let me explain about that. In a Wrongful
          Death suit you can sue for Pain and
          Suffering, Pecuniary Losses, Lose of
          Support or Services.. .And also what's
          called Care, Comfort and Society: --like
          advice, counseling of the parent that the
          kids aren't gonna get anymore...

<b>                         LISA
</b>          You can really sue for that?

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          Yeah, and that's probably what we would do,

<b>                         LISA
</b>          So -- I don't understand. Who are we suing?
          The bus driver?

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          Well, no, because the bus driver wouldn't
          have any money. You basically sue everybody
          and hope something sticks. The person who
          pays will be the MTA's insurance company.

<b>                         LISA
</b>          But do you think the driver would get
          fired?

<b>                         EMILY
</b>          But how much could they be liable for?

<b>                         DAVE EMILY
</b>          It depends: How badly do you think we
          could ever hurt them?

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          -- if she was alive, in great pain for an 
          extended period of time, they give more
          money for that.

<b>                         LISA
</b>          I'd say she was alive for ten minutes.

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          And I gather in a lot .of pain?

<b>                         LISA
</b>          Her leg was cut off.

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          Yes -- obviously. And -- but was she
          conscious? Awake, the whole time?

<b>                         LISA
</b>          I'm sorry, Emily. (To DAVE) Yeah, awake.

<b>                         EMILY
</b>          That's OK.

<b>                         DAVE 
</b>          Well, if she was in a lot of pain for that
          long ...I don't know. . .maybe 300,000 or a
          half a million dollars to get a sustainable
          verdict? A brain damaged baby would beâ€¢ 
          three million. But the truth is, Lisa, 
          after all's said and done, it's not a very
          good case.

<b>                         LISA
</b>          Why not?

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          Because it's your word against his, and
          because you already lied on your first
          deposition. A red light case is a fifty-
          fifty proposition already. And with only
          one eyewitness, with two conflicting
          statements? I wouldn't take-that case.

<b>                         DAVE

<b>                         DAVE

          it, the fact that Lisa lied on her first
          statement is a disaster for your lawyer.

<b>                         LISA
</b>          Can't I explain why I lied the first time?
          It's not like I'm trying to get any money
          for myself.

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          That's true-Since she have no financial
          interest she can't be impeached for bias.

<b>                         EMILY
</b>          Impeached for what?

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          She can't have her credibility attacked on
          financial grounds because the jury knows
          you're not getting any money if you win.

<b>                         LISA

          You said you might re-interview the bus
          driver...

          Yes, we did:.We brought him back in --

<b>                         LISA
</b>          You did? What happened?

<b>                         MITCHELL
</b>          Well, he basically stuck to his original
          representation, and that was pretty much
          it. I brought it up with my sergeant, but
          he agrees with me we still don't have
          enough to charge this guy, so there's
          really not a lot more we can do at this
          point.

<b>                         LISA
</b>          But how did you ask the questions?

<b>                         MITCHELL
</b>          Excuse me? 

<b>                         LISA
</b>          He's obviously not gonna change his 

                          
          statement if you just ask him like really
          politely: Why would he? We already know
          he's a liar.

<b>                         MITCHELL 
</b>          Hey, you know, Lisa, in the old days we'd
          just throw him in the back with a rubber
          hose and we'd get whatever answer we want
          out of him. But fortunately we don't do 
          that kind of thing anymore --

<b>                         LISA
</b>          Yeah, not to white people.

<b>                         MITCHELL
</b>          First of all, I don't know why you're
          bringin' the guy's race into it. There's
          forty thousand cops in this city --

<b>                         LISA
</b>          Yes, thank you, yes.

<b>                         MITCHELL
</b>          -- and I hate to disillusion you, but most
          of 'em are pretty good guys, just tryin' to
          do their job. Bottom line is the DA's not
          gonna take this case. (Pause) Now you could

</b>          -- so funny: it's the same show, but now
          they all read how great it is, we get these
          big standing ovations every night, and it's
          the exact same show as before.

<b>                         RAMON
</b>          But why do you put yourself down? It's a
          wonderful show and a wonderful performance.

<b>                         JOAN
</b>          No, it's not -- I'm not putting myself
          down. It's just that the audience always
          reacts differently if they've been told
          it's good. A lot of actors have that
          experience.

<b>                         RAMON
</b>          Mm hm?
          She takes a few steps away.

<b>                         JOAN
</b>          I love this view...(Pause) You know,

          or disgruntled. But I feel like we're 
          always misunderstanding each other. Do you
          feel that way at all? Or am I just
          completely off the beam?

<b>          132A INT. RAMON'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT. 132A
</b>
          Ramon and Joan are in his modernistic, scrupulously clean
          carpeted living room, on the sofa, looking at pictures.

<b>                         RAMON
</b>          That's a little place we used to go on
          holiday, two hours outside of
          Cartagena...My family is all there still,
          but Rodrigo is studying in London, and
          Hector is in Geneva.

<b>                         JOAN 
</b>          Uh huh... 

<b>                         RAMON 
</b>          I'm sure they will go back eventually,
          because they like to do something for their 
          country. But it's a worry, because it's 
          very bad there now.

<b>                         JOAN 
</b>          Yeah...I haven't really been following it.

<b>                         RAMON
</b>          It's a big, big mess. Last year I helped to
          found an organization to work with children
          whose families have been killed, or the
          parents have been kidnapped, so they don't
          know if they are alive or dead. We try to
          find homes for them, preferably in
          Colombia, because if we lose our young
          people, that's it: That's the future. We
          have raised a lot of money, but there's
          only so much we can do. You don't like to
          say it's hopeless, but it's hard to see the
          solution.

<b>                         JOAN
</b>          Yeah. God...I wish I knew more about
          it...Do you mind if I ask you something?

<b>                         RAMON
</b>          Of course not.

<b>                         JOAN

<b>                         JOAN
</b>          I guess you travel a lot. I've only been
          out of the country a few times in my whole
          life.

<b>                         RAMON
</b>          You should travel more.

<b>                         JOAN
</b>          I know. I've always wanted to. It's hard
          when you're in the theater...

<b>                         RAMON
</b>          Still, you should try. It's a big world.
          You're an artist. You should see more of
          it.

<b>                         JOAN
</b>          I know. You don't have to keep saying that.
          I've always wanted to travel. It's just a
          little difficult with two kids and no
          husband, but it's hard to make a lot of
          money in the theater. I was on a TV show a
          few years back and I socked away some money
          because of that, but my ex-husband --

<b>                         RAMON 
</b>          Karl.

<b>                         JOAN
</b>          Karl, yes, you remembered, very good.
          Karl's very generous with the kids when he
          can be, but he's struggling too: He's a
          director: he directs commercials, and now
          he's trying to produce them... Anyway, I'm
          not ignorant because I enjoy it.

<b>                         RAMON
</b>          I don't say you're ignorant... Do you think
          Lisa will be interested in acting? 

<b>                         JOAN
</b>          I don't think so. I think's she's got a
          lot of contempt for it. Of course that may
          be the age.

<b>                         RAMON

          you gotta realize it's gonna take some

          good parts without getting a lot of
          recognition. And even though you don't 
          necessarily do it for that as your primary

          notice something you've done.

          minute. And then she was asking me to call

          I said, "Sure, what's her name?" And she
          said her name was Lisa. And I said, "No,
          that's my name." Because it took me a

          daughter. You know? Like maybe that's the
          reason I was there: Like in some weird way,
          this obviously amazing woman got to see her
          daughter again for a few minutes, right
          before she died.

          took over my body. I'm not an idiot. It was
          just this feeling I had because she was
          holding onto my hand so hard before she

          On the blackboard Klein finishes writing: SHOULD TEENAGERS

<b>          RULE THE WORLD? YES OR NO?
</b>
<b>                         KLEIN
</b>          OK. Go ahead: Kirsten. Lionel: Put your
          drum away.
          Lionel stops drumming on his desk with his fingers.

<b>                         KIRSTEN
</b>          I think that teenagers should definitely
          rule the world, because teenagers aren't
          corrupted by adult life yet, and they're
          idealists and they care. And I know a lot
          of people feel that teenagers are really
          naive, which they are, many of them. But
          they still haven't had a chance to get
          burned out by the disappointments and the
          harsh realities of learning how to play the
          game. So yes, I would vote yes.

<b>                         KLEIN
</b>          All right: Lisa?

<b>                         LISA
</b>          I would tend to agree with all of that,
          except I do think that teenagers don't
          always necessarily think things through
          very carefully, and they don't have enough
          experience to know what the right thing to
          do is all the time. I also think they tend
          to adhere to ideologies really easily
          without having actually bothered to think
          them through for themselves.--

<b>                         LEWIS

</b>          OK... Hitler Youth.

<b>                         LISA
</b>          Or what about all these teenage suicide
          bombers? Not that I want to get into the
          whole Palestinian thing again, but assuming
          you don't think suicide bombing is a good
          thing, wouldn't you say that's an example
          of being idealistic without using your
          critical faculties?

          I'm talking about, because I know that
          subject is-off-limits. I'm talking about
          your soul, I guess, and how you feel you
          have to keep it in check all the time by
          being sensible. Do you know what I'm saying
          at all?

<b>                         MR AARON
</b>          Well...We all have feelings, Lisa. I happen
          to believe that who you are comes out of
          how you deal with those feelings. Somebody
          makes you mad, you don't just pick up a gun
          and shoot them...Or if you do, that says
          something about who you are, and how you've
          been raised...

<b>                         LISA
</b>          Well, I don't want to disillusion you, but
          we happen to be living in a world where
          that is what people do. More often than
          not.

<b>                         MR AARON
</b>          That's not true, Lisa. I think it's very
          sad that you see it that way. There's
          eight billion people alive in the world and
          you think they don't all want to kill
          someone once in a while? But they don't.
          Most of them. Or they see some person they
          -- (Pause) I think most people do try to be 
          civilized by some standard. Even if it's a
          standard you and I might not agree with...

</b>          Are you upset about something...?

<b>                         JOAN
</b>          No. This house is really beginning to get
          to me. And I'm a little confused what to do
          about Ramon. I mean, you were there: What
          do you think?

<b>                         LISA
</b>          Uh, gee, Mom maybe you should really think
          about it some more. Because it would
          probably hurt Ramon's feelings if you broke
          up with him and I think you better think
          about it before you do something like that
          to him.

<b>                         JOAN
</b>          I know I'm supposed to understand what
          you're doing right now, but if there's some
          kind of hidden message here I'm not getting
          it.

          CURTIS appears. They both watch Joan at the phone. Instead

          Joan and Lisa look around the room.

<b>                         LISA
</b>          OK, I'm really not trying to be funny, but
          isn't this a Jewish funeral home?

<b>                         JOAN
</b>          I guess they do both. 
          They notice a few too many good-looking women crying a little 
          too hard. Lisa and Joan look at each other. 
          RODRIGO, a handsome slender kid of 20, comes up to Joan. His
          accent is British, with a slight Colombian cadence.

<b>                         RODRIGO

          about you all the time.

<b>                         JOAN
</b>          He did?

<b>                         RODRIGO
</b>          Yes. The night he met you, he called me in
          England and woke me to tell me about it, he
          was so excited. I never heard him talk
          about anyone like that since my mother
          died.

          last time I spoke to him he told me from 
          the moment he met you he knew he wanted to
          marry you, because for the first time since 
          he lost my mother, he finally met a woman
          he could really connect with.

<b>                         JOAN
</b>          (at a total loss)
          Well -- he was a very sweet man. And I know
          he loved you and your brother very much.

</b>          People don't relate to each other, Mom.
          They're totally disconnected. And if they
          have any time for each other at all, it's
          either like a biological imperative or like
          some weird cultural anomaly. That's what I
          make of it.

<b>                         JOAN
</b>          Well...I think it's pretty unfortunate that
          you think that. Because I feel like you and
          I used to relate to each other really well.

          stands -- and the reason I asked Emily and
          Lisa to be here is because I know this may

          I pressed them very very hard on this, but
          they will not discuss disciplining of a
          company employee as part of the settlement
          because it could be seen as an admission of
          guilt on the part of the MTA --

<b>                         DEUTSCH
</b>          Settling out of court does not imply an
          admission of guilt. It simply does not
          carry the same stigma. On top of that you
          may not know, Lisa, they're involved in a
          very tricky labor dispute at the MTA right

          which is gonna hurt 'em half as much as
          now, and they're still not gonna fire this
          guy! Or maybe he'll have already quit and

          you see what I mean?

          money at all is because I started this
          whole fucking thing in motion! I'm sorry
          for swearing, but you should be willing to

          to Monica and I take that responsibility

</b>          I think you better tell them. Whoever they
          are.

<b>                         LISA
</b>          No...No...Never mind ...I'm sure he's sorry
          anyway, whichever one he is.

<b>                         MR AARON
</b>          I don't see what difference that makes, if
          he's sorry. And I think whoever it is
          should know about this.

<b>                         LISA
</b>          I'm sorry. I shouldn't have brought this
          up. Please don't tell anyone.

<b>                         BONNIE
</b>          We're not gonna tell anyone. But you're
          gonna have to tell whoever it could be --

<b>                         LISA
</b>          (On have to")
          That's OK. I gotta go. Thanks for
          listening. It's -- It doesn't matter about
          the father, because the whole thing was my
          fault. I'm sorry...!
          She shakes her head and runs away.

<b>                         BONNIE
</b>          What was that...?

          Lisa comes in. Curtis is doing his homework at the table.

<b>                         CURTIS
</b>          Mom's looking for you.

<b>                         LISA
</b>          What for?

<b>                         CURTIS
</b>          She thinks you're going out with her
          tonight.

<b>                         LISA
</b>          Where are we going?

<b>                         CURTIS
</b>          I don't know.
          Lisa heads for her room. Joan appears, half-dressed.

<b>                         JOAN
</b>          Lisa? Honey? Did you forget we're going to
          the opera?

<b>                         LISA
</b>          Yes.

<b>                         JOAN
</b>          I didn't-remind you because I didn't want
          to nag you.

<b>                         LISA
</b>          It's OK.

<b>          171 EXT. BROADWAY -- NEAR LINCOLN CENTER. DUSK. 171
</b>
           Lisa starts to cross the street against the light. Joan takes
          her arm.

<b>                         JOAN
</b>          Don't get run over.
          A cab rattles by. Lisa looks down the street. A BUS is
          approaching.

<b>                         LISA
</b>          Wait. I want to see if that's him.

<b>                         JOAN
</b>          What.
          They wait. The bus gets closer, heading straight toward them
          and stops at the bus stop. Lisa grabs her mother's arm.

<b>                         LISA
</b>          It is him. Mom, that's the one...
          Joan and Lisa look at him. He's staring out ahead of him as
          people board the bus. He SEES Lisa and Joan but can't see
          their faces and doesn't recognize Lisa: He just sees two
          dolled-up women under the street light. He smiles dazzling at
          them and drives past with a short wave.
          Joan looks at Lisa. She looks like she's about to throw up.

<b>                         JOAN
</b>          Come on. We're gonna miss the curtain.

<b>          172 EXT. METROPOLITAN OPERA -- OUTDOOR TERRACE. NIGHT. 172
</b>
          Lisa is out on the terrace smoking a cigarette, looking out
          over Lincoln Center. Joan comes out and stands next to her,
          but Lisa won't look at her or interact.

<b>                         JOAN
</b>          Well, so far it's not the greatest opera I
          ever heard.

<b>                         LISA
</b>          What do you mean? It's OK.
          The end-of-intermission chimes sound. People start going in.
          Joan turns and goes in too. Lisa keeps smoking.

<b>           172A INT. METROPOLITAN OPERA - GRAND STAIRCASE. NIGHT 172A 
</b>
           Lisa comes down the stairs and goes into -- 

<b>          173 INT. METROPOLITAN OPERA -- ORCHESTRA. NIGHT. 173
</b>
           Lisa hurries down the long aisle. The LIGHTS DIM. The 
           audience applauds the entering conductor. She picks her way 
           past the other patrons in the row, whispering "Excuse me" and
           takes her seat just as the MUSIC STARTS. Joan looks at her. 
           Lisa stares straight ahead. 

           The curtain rises. On stage, the two women start singing the 
          barcarole "Belle Nuit." It's very beautiful.
          Joan looks next to her at Lisa. Lisa is trying not to cry,
          but tears are dripping slowly down her face. She sniffs and
          wipes them away, but they keep coming.
          Joan looks at her again, but Lisa still won't look at her.
          Joan takes Lisa's hand and Lisa breaks down completely,
          clutching Joan's hand back, squeezing it hard. Joan starts
          crying too out of sympathy.

          As the duet goes on they sit side by side holding hands, Lisa
          crying and holding on and wiping her eyes with her free hand
          and Joan crying too, but not as hard, grateful finally that
          the spell has been broken.

          The duet ends and we CUT TO BLACK.
