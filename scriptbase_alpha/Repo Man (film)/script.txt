               Repo Man theme music now begins playing. Map is shown in background 
               (green text on black background), zoomed in on Los Alamos, New 
               Mexico. While remaining credits are shown, the map travels to 
               Sante Fe, then Albuquerque, then begins following US66 west through 
               Arizona to California, finally ending up a few miles east of 
               Goffs (northwest of Needles).
 
               Green '64 Chevy Malibu

               Malibu is weaving down the highway in the desert, passes billboard 
               with motorcycle cop behind it. Cop pulls out behind Malibu.

                         Forty-niner and his daughter Clementine. 
                         Oh my darlin, oh my darlin...
 
               Motorcycle cop pulls the car over, gets off motorcycle and raps 
               on car window.

                         Clementine Clemen-

                         Let me see your drivers license.

                                     COUNTY SHERIFF
                         From out of town, hmm? What's you got 
                         in the trunk?
 
                                     J. FRANK PARNELL
                         oah...you don't want to look in there.

                         Give me the keys.

               The motorcycle cop walks around to the back of the car and opens 
               the trunk. The car has New Mexico license plates KBB-283. In 
               every scene after this when the plates are visible, they will 
               be 127-GBH.

                         AHHHHHH!

               The motorcycle cop gets disintegrated, leaving behind a pair 
               of flaming boots (a reference to the movie Timerider, which was 
               co-written and produced by Mike Nesmith). Parnell watches from 
               side mirror, where we see that the left side of his sunglasses 
               have no lens.
 
                                     J. FRANK PARNELL
                         Oh my darlin Clementine, you are lost 
                         now gone forever, dreadful sorry Clementine.
 
                         
               Otto and Kevin, in the supermarket, facing cans of generic yellow 
               cling sliced peaches.
 
                                     KEVIN
                         Do Do Do De Do De Do De Do De Do Feeling 
                         Do De Da Do De Do De Do Feeling seven-up. 
                         I'm feeling seven-up. Feeling seven 
                         up. I'm feeling seven up. It's a crisp 
                         refreshing feeling crystal clear and 
                         light. America's drinking seven-up and 
                         it sure feels right. Feeling lucky seven.
 
                         
               Otto puts price sticker on Kevin's glasses.

                         Hum. I wasn't singing guy.

                                     OTTO
                         I'm standing right next to you and you're 
                         fucking (flippin) singing. Cut it out.
 
                         
                                     KEVIN
                         Jeeze. Why so tense guy?

                                     MR. HUMPHRIES
                         Otto?

                                     KEVIN
                         Mister Humphries!

                                     MR. HUMPHRIES
                         You were late again this morning. Now 
                         normally I'd let it go but it's been 
                         brought to my attention that you're 
                         not paying attention to the way you 
                         space the cans. Many young men of your 
                         age in these uncertain times-
 
                                     MR. HUMPHRIES
                         Otto! Are you paying attention to me?
 
                         
                                     LOUIE
                         Hey! He's talking to you!

               Kevin chuckles

               Otto grabs Kevin by the front of his shirt, steps around him, 
               and pushes him into the stack of cans (this has been described 
               as a goof but it's clearly just a case of awkward staging used 
               to make the shot work).
 
               Louie pulls his gun.

                                     LOUIE
                         (Basta!) 

                                     KEVIN
                         You gotta love getting fired from your 
                         job in a big way, Otto.
 
                                     MR. HUMPHRIES
                         What are you laughing at? Louie, throw 
                         him out too.
 
                                     LOUIE
                         Come on you  worm. Get out of here.
 
                         
               Louie shoves Kevin down aisle where Otto is walking out. Otto 
               takes off his clip-on bow tie and tosses it back towards Louie. 
               Louie twirls his gun and puts it away. Note that the store aisle 
               is lined with nothing but generic products, plain black lettering 
               on white background. All products in movie from now on will have 
               this appearance.
 
               Punks slamdancing to Coup D'etat in the back of a warehouse.
 
               
               Otto is there slamdancing and Duke walks up, the two of them 
               swing each other around. Behind them, the graffiti on the wall 
               says "Circle Jerks", a band which will appear later in the movie.
 
               
                                     OTTO
                         How you doing dude? When did you get 
                         out of the slammer man?
 
               Otto enters bedroom where Debbi is waiting in bed.

                                     DEBBI
                         What's the difference? ]

                                     OTTO
                         Huh?

               Otto lays back on the bed and puts his hands behind his head.
 
               
                                     OTTO
                         okay

               Debbi pulls back his shirt a little and begins kissing his stomach, 
               then stops.
 
                                     DEBBI
                         Otto. Otto.

                                     OTTO
                         What?

                                     DEBBI
                         Get me another beer.

               Otto goes downstairs and there's a party going on. Institutionalized 
               plays in background.
 
                                     KEVIN
                         Ow. Cool. Ow. Dammit. I'm supposed to 
                         be the host here.
 
                                     KEVIN
                         Ow!

               Otto returns to the bedroom

                                     OTTO
                         Debbi honey. I got you a beer.

               Otto turns on light and finds Duke there with Debbi.

                                     [OTTO

                         a big baby.

                         Turn the fucking light out.]

               Otto leaves room just as Kevin arrives and looks in the door.
 
               
                                     KEVIN

               [Otto in a vacant lot drinking a beer.

               It's early morning and Otto starts walking.

               Otto still walking, but it's light now.

               Bud pulls up next to him in a blue sedan.

                         viewer that says now the only reason 
                         Reverend Larry comes on your television 
                         set is because he wants your money. 
                         And do you know what? They're right! 
                         I do want your money. Because god wants 
                         your money. So I want you to go out 
                         and mortgage that home and sell that 
                         car and send me your money. You don't 
                         need that car. (continues in background)

                         but ummm. That you told me that you'd 
                         give me a thousand dollars to go to 
                         Europe if I finish school. Well you 
                         know something? You were right. About 
                         finishing school that's ah that's what 
                         I'd like to do. But umm I want to know 
                         if I could have the money first. Like 
                         now. [You know I really love you Dad

               Otto and Bud riding in Bud's car

               Jazz music plays on the radio. In almost all scenes inside of 
               Bud's car, Jazz music will be playing on the radio.
 
               In this sequence the background changes from day to night, back 
               to day, and back to night again (during the speed snorting scene) 
               even though the dialog seems continuous. I believe that this 
               was done intentionally to show the passage of time, but the disjointed 
               events are cut so smoothly as to make it seem like they goofed 
               the continuity. It's clearer in the TV version where there truly 
               is a break between the line about speed and the actual snorting.

                         Paid? You don't get paid. Are you kidding, 
                         you work on commission, that's better 
                         than getting paid.

                         hundred dollars. Fifty thousand dollar

                         Ha. Only an asshole (a jackass) gets 
                         killed for a car. Guys who make it are 
                         the guys who get into their cars at 
                         anytime. Get in at three A.M. get up 
                         at four. That's why there ain't a repo

               Bud at payphone

               Bud is talking on phone.

                                     BUD

               Bud picks up phone and dials. Phone begins making a loud whining 
               noise.
 
               Bud gets sledgehammer from car and destroys phone while Otto 
               watches. When Bud is done, Otto gets crowbar from car and beats 
               side of phone with it while laughing.

               (In the television version, this entire scene takes place while 
               watching Bud's car drive down a road, but you can still hear 
               the snorting in the background.)

                         things once. One of those UFOs. I mean 
                         it was really it was kind of kind of 
                         scary. I saw all these colored lights 
                         and, uh, sounds. I mean sounds and lights 
                         like I never heard before. I mean it 
                         was really weird.

                         It's really very simple Mrs. Parks. 
                         You don't want me to take your car and 
                         I don't want to take your car. Now I 
                         said to the boss I said ah Look! I do 
                         not want to repossess this lady’s car.

                         on the line over this one. I could lose 
                         it right away.

               Parks yelling at her son.

                         I gave you the money last week to pay 
                         it and you didn't do it. What did you 
                         do with it? I'm so tired of giving you 
                         money and you squandering it. I know 
                         what you done you all went out dancing 
                         some where. That's what you did. Next 
                         time I give you some money I want you 
                         to put it in the car ya hear. You're 
                         working. How come you didn't do it huh? 
                         I don't know what's happened to you. 
                         (continues softly)
 
               Otto starts car and guns engine, but now we clearly see that 
               the rear wheels are up on jacks (that it wasn't up on jacks before 
               has been listed as a goof and even confirmed by Alex Cox, but 
               I think they're wrong. It is hard to tell in the dark, but you 
               can see the base of one of the jacks lit up by a light from the 
               house which goes dark as a band member runs in front of it on 
               the other side of the car, thus confirming that the car actually 
               was up on jacks in all the scenes).
 
               Band members run out of house and pull Otto out of car.

                                     OTTO
                         Hey it's cool. It's cool. I like music 
                         too man, hey
 
               Otto gets beat up. One band member hits him twice over the head 
               with a guitar, making an audible "kabong" noise. Supposedly you 
               can hear one member saying "this one's for Keith Moon", but I've 
               never been able to make it out.

               Archie and Duke run by the Malibu. Debbie stops, whistles and 
               gets in the car. Archie and Duke jump in and they drive off to 
               the sound of a Latino version of The Ride of the Valkyries. Lagarto 
               walks out of the phone booth just as this is happening and drops 
               his clipboard in disgust. Napolean walks out of the store, silently

               drinks through straws.

                         while but...
 
               Otto sees the Malibu and gives chase. Losing the car, he stops

               as it goes through a railroad crossing which has red lights blinking 
               and bell ringing. J. Frank Parnell stops and lets him in.

                         I go to Utah every year. Friend of mine, 
                         was a designer of the MX missile race 
                         track basing mode. A hundred thousand 
                         miles of railroad track on a big loop 
                         through Utah, Arizona, and Nevada. Bombs 
                         were going to hide in locomotive sheds. 
                         That way the red team would never know 
                         exactly where they were. I still go 
                         out to Utah, just to think about the 
                         way things might have been.

                         Yeah?

               Otto enters and Marlene uses the distraction to kick the shit 
               out of the agents.

                         My car's gone and we're going to get 
                         to the bottom of this.

                         Like hell we are.

                         That's how it's going to have to be.

                         I've been wanting to do that one for 
                         a long time honey.

                         Hey Fletch. Coffee break.

               Otto throws a pot of coffee into Plettschner's face. Marlene 
               steps through door. Otto steps outside and is immediately captured 
               by agents.
 
               Agent Rogersz and Leila watch Otto on monitor

                                     AGENT ROGERSZ
                         Good evening Otto. This is agent Rogersz. 
                         I'm going to ask you a few questions. 
                         And since time is short and you may 
                         lie, I'm going to have to torture you. 
                         But I want you to know it isn't personal.
 
                         
                                     OTTO
                         Look Ah this isn't really necessary. 
                         I'll tell you anything you want to know.
 
                         
                                     AGENT ROGERSZ
                         Good! Where is the Malibu?

                                     OTTO
                         I don't know. Somebody ripped it from 
                         the yard.
 
               Otto his hit with electric shock and screams.

                                     LEILA
                         I don't think he knows.

                                     AGENT ROGERSZ
                         Increase the voltage.

                                     LEILA
                         But what if he's innocent?

                                     AGENT ROGERSZ
                         No one is innocent. Proceed.

               Another electric shock and screams. Then Marlene and the Rodiguez 
               brothers enter interrogation room and rescue Otto.
 
                                     AGENT ROGERSZ
                         Ah yes! Look at them. High heels, hair 
                         nets, those ridiculous trench coats. 
                         They're pathetic.

                         But agent Rogersz, they're getting away.

                         That's all part of the plan.

               Brothers, Marlene, and Otto drive away.

                                     MARLENE
                         Otto, Otto pull your self together.

                         Shhh to you too.

               Otto and Marlene enter elevator with 2 health professionals. 
               Lagarto turns away woman on crutches trying to get in.
 
                                     LAGARTO
                         Out of order. Take the stairs.

               Otto and Marlene exit elevator wearing clothes taken from health 
               professionals. Otto has a smiley face button on his right collar.

               who has just filled out a form.

                         they expect you to pick it up.
 
               Otto and Marlene see a door with a pine tree air freshener hanging 
               from the knob. It's Bud's room. They go in.

               Otto, Marlene and the Rodriguez brothers get chased by the agents 
               down the stairs.

               As they drive off and agents run after, the glowing Malibu drives 
               by and strikes down two of the agents with lightening bolts.
