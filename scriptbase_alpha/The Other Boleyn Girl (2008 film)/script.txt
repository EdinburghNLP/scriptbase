    EXT. FIELD - DAY
1                                                                  1
     We're moving through a cornfield. At speed. The sound of
    children's laughter. Excited shrieking.

     A beautiful young girl, (MARY BOLEYN, 8), our heroine, runs
    through the fields, being chased by her younger brother, GEORGE,
    and sister, ANNE, (10).

     Touchingly, MARY is barely taller than the corn, her head
    skimming along the sheaves.

     REVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL: the children are being watched by their
    parents, (SIR THOMAS and LADY ELIZABETH BOLEYN).

                            SIR THOMAS
              I received a formal request for marriage
             today for Anne.
                     (a beat)
              From the Carey family.

    SIR THOMAS indicates to
                         ANNE; the eldest. Dark-haired.
    Intelligent. The obvious leader among the children.

                        LADY ELIZABETH
           But that's wonderful.

                        SIR THOMAS
             I turned it down.

     LADY ELIZABETH turns...`What?'

                        SIR THOMAS
            And offered them Mary instead.

    SIR THOMAS indicates 
                         MARY, the middle child. Fair-haired.
    Pretty. Sweet-natured.

                          SIR THOMAS
           Fnne's too good for William Carey. She
           can do (better than a merchant's son.

                          LADY ELIZABETH
            You underestimate Mary.

                          SIR THOMAS
            Not true. I think she's..the kinder of
           the two. Quite possibly the fairer.

    The CHILDREN, meanwhile, have started a race..

                         SIR THOMAS
           But to get ahead in this world, you need
           more than fair looks and a kind heart.

     On the field, ANNE wins. She jumps up and down, holding her arms
    aloft, as MARY flops to the floor. Vanquished.

                                                                2.


    SIR THOMAS smiles, `See?' He walks towards ANNE..

                        SIR THOMAS
                  (applauding his favourite)
           Bravo! Anne!

    Bells ring high up in the bell-tower of a country church.


    INT. MARY'S BEDROOM - DAY

    MARY, ten years older, and grown into a heavenly bride is in her
    room, surrounded by MAIDS and SEAMSTRESSES making final
    adjustments to her dress. A knock at the door.

                        ANNE
           May we come in..?

    ANNE and GEORGE enter. GEORGE lets out a low whistle..

                        ANNE
           Look at you..! Younger than me. More
           beautiful than me. Married before me.
                  (a beat)
           I am eclipsed. I am just the `Other
           Boleyn Girl.'

                        MARY
           Hardly.

                        GEORGE
           No, is this it? This is the end of the
           unholy trinity?

    GEORGE extends her arms, wraps them around his two sister. An
    intimate moment.

                        MARY
           No, George. Never. I'll be married,
           that's all..
                  (a beat)
           Apart from that - it won't change a
           thing.

    The three of them hug together, tightly..


    INT. CHAPEL - DAY

    A packed country church. The PRIEST officiates in Latin. The air
    is thick with incense. And winter cold..




                                                             3.


    The entire BOLEYN FAMILY is assembled on one side. FATHER,
    MOTHER, the DUKE and DUCHESS of NORFOLK, brother GEORGE, and
    finally ANNE..

                        PRIEST
           Confirma hoc, Deus, quod operatus es in
           nobis..

    The PRIEST sprinkles the ring with holy water. WILLIAM CAREY,
    (35), puts it on MARY's finger.

      few rows back, a young NOBLEMAN stares at ANNE. Looks at her
    across the church. Obviously attracted. ANNE notices.


    INT. BOLEYN HOME - NIGHT
5                                                                 5
    The party afterwards. MUSICIANS play. The bride and groom,
    (WILLIAM and MARY), are dancing, surrounded by WELL-WISHERS and
    other GUESTS..

                        WILLIAM
           Are you happy?

                         MARY
           Very.

                        WILLIAM
           You don't secretly wish you'd married
           someone grander? With a title?

                        MARY
           No. I want a husband who loves me. And
           who thinks it first thing every morning.
           And last thing at night.

                        WILLIAM
           Then you've found the right man.

    IN ANOTHER CORNER:

    ANNE is dancing with her brother GEORGE. She looks up to see the
    NOBLEMAN who was staring at her across the church..

                        ANNE
           Who is that? He was staring at me in
           church?

                        GEORGE
           That's Henry Percy. Heir to the Duke of
           Northumberland. Richest landowner in
           England.

    ANNE's eyes widen in interest, "Really?"




                                                      (CONTINUED)

          


                                                              4.


                        GEORGE
           But don't get your hopes up. He is
           already betrothed.

    GEORGE indicates a tall, haughty-looking FIANCEE beside PERCY..

                        ANNE
           Betrothed is not married, brother
           George. A lot can happen before you
           reach the altar.

    ANNE stares over at HENRY PERCY. Who stares back.


    IN ANOTHER CORNER:

     he DUKE OF NORFOLK, the most powerful nobleman in the room, and
    close personal friend of the KING's walks with his growling DOGS
    to where SIR THOMAS BOLEYN and LADY ELIZABETH are sitting. SIR
    THOMAS gets to his feet..

                         SIR THOMAS
           Thomas..

     he DUKE ignores THOMAS, and goes instead to his sister, (LADY
    ELIZABETH), and kisses her..

                         NORFOLK
           I think I have managed to persuade the
           King to come and stay with you on
           progress. A week-end's hunting in late
           summer.

                        SIR THOMAS
           But that's wonderful! Thank you, thank
           you so much..
                  (he turns to ELIZABETH)
           Did you hear that, Elizabeth?

                        LADY ELIZABETH
                  (hates the idea)
           Yes.

                        SIR THOMAS
           Finally we can present George, and with
           luck, get him a position at court.

    LADY ELIZABETH excuses herself, and leaves..

                        NORFOLK
           These are difficult times. I have it on
           good authority that the Queen no longer
           bleeds - yet the matter of a male heir
           is still not resolved.
                   a beat)
           It cannot be long before the King is
           forced to look outside the marriage.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

       

                                                             5.


                        SIR THOMAS
           What? And make a bastard King of
           England?

                        NORFOLK
           A legitimized bastard. What choice does
           he have?
                  (a beat)
           Obviously, I've given it thought, and
           wondered which Howard girl I could put
           under his nose. Imagine the influence
           that would give us. To be blood family
           of the next King of England. Equally,
           imagine if another family were to
           achieve the same?

    NORFOLK indicates SIR JOHN SEYMOUR in the corner, and his two
    loathsome, ambitious sons EDWARD and THOMAS..

                        SIR THOMAS
           What about Anne?

    SIR THOMAS turns, and indicates ANNE across the crowds, who's
    dancing with GEORGE...

                        SIR THOMAS
           I realise as a `Boleyn' she is not
           officially a `Howard', but as your
           sister's daughter..

                        NORFOLK
           But she's your eldest, Thomas. Your
           first born. And your favourite. Wouldn't
           you prefer her to have a nice,
           uncomplicated, respectable marriage?
           Like Mary?

                        SIR THOMAS
           If Anne were an uncomplicated,
           respectable girl like Mary, then I'd say
           `yes'. But she's not.

    SIR THOMAS looks out at ANNE..

                        SIR THOMAS
           She's anything but.

    SIR THOMAS and LADY ELIZABETH stand in a corner, watching the
    party continue. ELIZABETH's face darkens..

                         ADY ELIZABETH
             don't like it. It would cost a fortune
           to make our house fit for a royal visit.
           Money we don't have.

           And what if theDY ELIZABETH(cont'd)
                        LA king doesn't like her?
           Or if she sleeps with him but gives him
           a girl?

                        SIR THOMAS
           And what if you were to look on the
           bright side? Just once?

    An ominous clap of thunder outside..

                        SIR THOMAS
           Risk nothing, you gain nothing.

     ADY ELIZABETH stares at her husband..

                        LADY ELIZABETH
            hen was it that people stopped thinking
           of ambition as a sin, and started
           thinking of it as a virtue?

                        SIR THOMAS
           Easy for you to say. You've had power
           and wealth all your life.

                        LADY ELIZABETH
           Until I married you, Thomas. And I was
           happy to give it up.

    LADY ELIZABETH turns, and walks back inside.

    ANNE knocks on the door of her father's study. She waits.
    Presently, the door opens. We see SIR THOMAS inside..

                        ANNE
           You asked to see me father?

                        SIR THOMAS
           Yes. Come in.

    SIR THOMAS closes the door.

    MARY is in a bathroom. Being prepared by ANNE for her wedding
    night. ANNE brushes her sister's hair. Rubs oil in her skin.

                        MARY
            o - the King himself is coming to
           Hever. I'm so happy for George.

                        ANNE
           Yes. But Father took me aside. It seems
           he has ambitions for me, too.

            He thinks I'm ANNE(coage dnow...and of not
                          of an nt' )
            unpleasing appearance...

                         MARY
            What? What are you saying..?

                         ANNE
            It's known the King has a wandering eye.
            Imagine...if he were to like me?

                          MARY
            But...you could never be more than his
            mistress. And that's no substitute for a
            husband.
                         ANNE
            But as the King's mistress the least I'd
            get after he finished with me would be
            an Earl. And if I fell pregnant? And
            gave him what his wife has failed to?
                    a beat)
            Quite apart from the money, it'd be a
            Duke at least.

                         MARY
            But what about your happiness? Your
            future?

     ANNE shrugs, smiles..

                         ANNE
            I could be a happy Duchess.

     MARY and ANNE enter the bedroom. A sea of candles. MARY stares
     at the bed. A child. Suddenly terrified.

                         ANNE
            Are you nervous?

                         MARY
            A little.

                         ANNE
            You'll tell me everything in the
            morning?

                         MARY
            I promise.

                         ANNE
            No details spared?

     The two SISTERS hug tightly. Visibly emotional.






The door opens, and WILLIAM CAREY appears in the doorway. ANNE
curtseys, gives MARY a last `Good luck' kiss, then goes.

MARY stares at her husband.

                    MARY
       Hold me a moment?

WILLIAM CAREY envelops MARY with his arms..

                    MARY (cont'd)
       I'm so lucky to have a man who is
       content with what he has.

MARY looks at him..

                    MARY (cont'd)
       You are, aren't you?

WILLIAM CAREY smiles, looks at his gorgeous bride..

                    WILLIAM
       I am the luckiest man in the world.

WILLIAM reaches for the wine..

                      WILLIAM (cont'd)
       Drink?

MARY shakes her head. But WILLIAM tenderly insists..

                    WILLIAM (cont'd)
       You should. It will hurt less.

MARY nervously drinks..

                      WILLIAM (cont'd)
       Lie back.

MARY lies down. Then she lifts up her nightdress. WILLIAM pulls
down his trousers.

MARY extends her hands. Inviting him to join her. WILLIAM slowly
lowers himself on top of her. He enters her.

MARY smiles, in anticipation of pleasure. A side to her one
might not have imagined.

But one or two strokes later, and WILLIAM's knuckles whiten, his
face reddens, then he cries out, and slumps on top of her.

MARY looks up. Surely that wasn't it?

                      WILLIAM (cont'd)
       Thank you.

     WILLIAM rolls over. MARY stares. Soon WILLIAM snores
     contentedly. MARY is wide awake. Confused.

      aybe this is how it's meant to be.

                                                   FADE TO BLACK:


     EXT. ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
11                                                                11
     The thunder of horses' hooves. A huge cloud of dust.

     The Royal Standard flutters in the wind. Beneath it, a SOLDIER
     in the KING's uniform, riding hard, dirt kicking up in his wake.

     The SOLDIER is flanked by a dozen other of the KING's SOLDIERS,
     who lead a coloumn of fifty or more RIDERS..

     It's like an army. A legion riding into battle. But it's not,
     This is just the KING OF ENGLAND going away for the week-end.

     Behind the advance party, is the KING himself, (30's), handsome,
     in his prime, surrounded by a dozen or so of his closest
     COURTIERS, (among them the DUKE of NORFOLK), a grand, tough,
     intimidating lot.

     Behind them, comes the KING's CONFESSOR, a Priest with a large
     ornate crucifix, a small library of religious books..

     Then, in a riot of colour, come the MUSICIANS, the FOOL and the
     PLAYERS, led by the MASTER of the REVELS.

     Behind them, come the SQUIRES and PAGES, carrying the King's
     weapons, his jousting kit, his swords, his armour, his lance,
     etc.

     Then come the animals: FALCONS, in cages, and the HUNTING
     HOUNDS, beagles and pinchers, barking in excitement, and an
     assortment of FRESH HORSES for travelling, and hunting.

     And finally, bringing up the rear, another unit of ARMED GUARDS,
     and a second STANDARD BEARER..

     The BOLEYN family page, (WILLIAM STAFFORD), is perched on a
     hill. Keeping watch. Staring into the distance..

     Presently, he sees clouds of dust and the sound of thunder
     approaching. His expression changes...

     Pandemonium breaks out among STAFF and FAMILY MEMBERS as
     STAFFORD calls out, "The King!"

         



                                                                10.

     ANNE is being dressed by MAIDS. Hearing the commotion outside,
     she rushes over to the window to see the approaching RIDERS.

     ANNE looks out of the window. Scans the approaching RIDERS until
     she finds the KING..

                           ANNE
            There he is!

     The young HENRY TUDOR is a dazzling, magnetic, intensely
     glamorous and handsome figure. A total contrast from the
     bloated, bearded figure of his later years.

                         ANNE
            You think he will like me?

                         MARY
            Of course, sister. How could he not?

     ANNE turns to face MARY. The two SISTERS embrace tightly.

     The entire BOLEYN FAMILY is nervously assembled outside the
     house, (which we notice has been transformed at great cost. Huge
     marquees in the gardens. Fountains. Additional staff. Smart
     uniforms. New extensions to the stables and kitchens).

     MARY is discreetly hidden, among the CROWDS. ANNE is pride of
     place. Visibly nervous. SIR THOMAS and LADY ELIZABETH are beside
     her. The proud PARENTS.

     Everyone bows deeply in deference as the King arrives.

                         SIR THOMAS
            Your Majesty, you are most welcome.

     The King dismounts athletically. His DOGS are unleashed, bark
     excitedly..

                         HENRY
            Sir Thomas.

            Lady Elizabeth..

     A SERVANT in stiff, new uniform, with trembling hands, brings
     wine on a tray. HENRY takes a glass..

                         SIR THOMAS
            May I present my son, George.

     GEORGE, visibly nervous, bows deeply from the neck. But HENRY's
     attention has been caught by a beautiful woman behind GEORGE..

                                                       (CONTINUED)

    

                                                             11.


                         HENRY
                   (while staring at MARY)
            Your Uncle tells me I should have you at
            court. Should I?

                         GEORGE
            It would be a great honour, Sir.

     MARY dutifully, modestly averts her eyes..

                         SIR THOMAS
            And our daughter, Anne.

      ENRY turns to see ANNE.

                          ENRY
            No one said anything of a daughter.

     ANNE curtseys deeply...

                         HENRY
            Had we known, we might have come sooner.

                         ANNE
            Your Majesty..

                         SIR THOMAS
            Perhaps you'll allow Anne to show you
            around our modest house?

                            HENRY
            A pleasure.

     ANNE offers HENRY her hand. He takes it, then leads ANNE away.
     MARY shoots ANNE a look, `Good luck'.

     ANNE leads the KING through the house. She is followed at a
     distance by SIR THOMAS BOLEYN. And watched by MARY and GEORGE
     from a gallery above..

                         ANNE
            Here is the library.

                            HENRY
            Charming.

                         ANNE
            And through here, the observatory..

     HENRY looks up, his eye having been caught by something..

                           HENRY
            What's that?

     HENRY points at an emblem above a doorway..

                           ANNE
                falcon, your Grace.

                         HENRY
            I can see that. But what's it doing
            there? More to the point..
                   (turns 360)
            ..not just there, but in every corner in
            the house?

                         ANNE
            I have no idea. Ask my father.
                    a beat)
            Perhaps because falcons are vaguely
            associative with field sports - field
            sports with aristocracy - and in the
            absence of a genuine coat of arms..
                   (shrugs)
            ...a man with ambition will do the
            strangest things.

     HENRY is delighted by ANNE's candour..

                          ENRY
            That's a sharp tongue you have.
                    a beat)
            I wonder what it might say about me
            behind my back?

                         ANNE
            Oh, his Majesty has nothing to fear from
            me. Unless he fears an excess of
            compliments.

     HENRY smiles, visibly charmed..

                         HENRY
            Really? And what would they be..?

     WATCHING FROM ABOVE, MARY smiles to herself, "Well done, Anne",
     as HENRY and ANNE continue down a corridor..

            Bravo, Anne! The King was quite smitten!
            Told me so himself. And has requested
            you sit beside him at dinner.

     SIR THOMAS adjusts her hair..

                         SIR THOMAS
            My girl. My dear, remarkable girl. I
            knew you would up to the task.

     MARY watches. A momentary stab of jealousy at FATHER's
     attention. But as ANNE looks over at MARY for support..

     MARY smiles. Shakes herself out of it. It's her sister. What was
     she thinking?

     MUSIC is being played. Everyone is dressed in their finest, a
     packed banquet hall. MUSICIANS come to a climax, loud and
     enthusiastic applause from everyone. HENRY gets to his feet..

            Well played! And, may I say..

       What of our painters, then?

                     RANDON
       Years behind their Italian counterparts.
       The truth is far from leading the world,
       we're a provincial outpost, lagging far
       behind.

                    HENRY
       What? Is no one proud to be English?
              (turns to ANNE)
       Anne? What say you?

ANNE gulps. The clanking of cutlery. All eyes on her.

       Well said.

       Or our navy? The finest in the world.

                    HENRY
       It's true.

                    ANNE
       The universities in Spain and the
       philosophers in Germany may be strong,
       but are they really the equal of Oxford
       and Thomas More?

                    HENRY
       Never!

                    ANNE
       I doubt there is a country that is
       fairer in Government, or better
       protected by nature from her enemies,
       whose people are happier or more
       prosperous..

HENRY is delighted. SIR THOMAS stares proudly across the room at
ANNE. Who's hand, we notice, is shaking.

            You did well tonight. Very well. Quite
            enough to be invited to court, I am sure
            of it.

            Now go to bed. Get a good night's sleep.

     EXT. HEVER CASTLE - STABLE YARD - DAY

     The following morning..

     Thirty or more RIDERS, STABLE-BOYS and HORSES are gathered. To
     one side, a deafening pack of DEER-HOUNDS, (wire-haired
     Lurchers), barking frantically.

      t's a scene of great activity, excitement, and anticipation.

     The MASTER OF THE HORSE helps HENRY mount his steed - the
     biggest and most glamorous stallion of all, with wonderful,
     ornate saddlery.

       number of OTHER LADIES are also going hunting, and we notice
     they ride pillion, (ie), riding on the same horse as their MEN,
     sitting behind them, holding onto them..
     F
      inally, ANNE comes out. The KING turns..

                         ANNE
            Good morning, your Grace.

                         HENRY
             ho will you be riding with?

     It's clearly an invitation. He indicates there is room for ANNE
     on the back of his saddle. But ANNE fails to read the signal.

                         ANNE
            On my own your Grace.

                          HENRY
            Your own..?

     A STABLE-BOY leads out her horse.

                         ANNE
            They have invented a new saddle which
            allows ladies to ride on their own.

     ANNE skilfully mounts the horse, and sits upright..

                         HENRY
             ut with no man to hold onto? How will
            you stay on the horse?

                         ANNE
            Why? The same way you hold onto yours,
            your Grace.

     A flicker behind HENRY's eyes. It's the first wrong move ANNE
     has made.

                          HENRY
            We'll see.

      ENRY yanks the reins on his horse..

     ANNE shoots a look at MARY. Then follows.

     The thunder of hooves..

     WILLIAM STAFFORD leads the way out with a pack of some forty or
     fifty hounds. It's a stirring sight. Following the hounds, come
     thirty or forty RIDERS, led by the KING himself.

     Up ahead, the HOUNDS start to bark. Their pace increases.
     They've got a scent. The BUGLER blows his horn..

     The DOGS begin to increase their pace. The RIDERS urge their
     horses to gallop. The LADIES hold tight to their MEN..

     Up ahead, a STAG, wide-eyed, innocent, lifts it's head..

     The sound of the hunting bugle and the roar of approaching
     footsteps, like thunder.

     The STAG twitches in fear, then bolts off towards the forest.

     The DOGS and RIDERS roar across fields. The hounds snarl, almost
     delirious with primal agitation..

     Among the RIDERS, the more advanced HORSEMEN have already opened
     up a clear lead on their weaker counterparts..

      n the advanced group, are HENRY, several COURTIERS, his GUARDS
     and, of course, ANNE..

     They jump over a hedge. One of HENRY's COURTIERS catches the
     hedge and falls. HENRY smiles, then turns to see..

     ANNE comfortably jumping the hedge herself. HENRY's smile fades.
     He urges his horse to greater speed..

                           HENRY
                     (kicking his horse)
            Hah..!

     The terrified DEER bolts into safety of the forest. The barking
     HOUNDS, locked into the scent, follow.

      he RIDERS see this, and some pull up.

                          IDER
            We've lost him. He's in the forest.

     Galloping through trees and thick forest is not for the
     fainthearted. But HENRY charges past, kicking up dirt..

                         HENRY
            Then we must follow.

     HENRY weaves skilfully through low-hanging branches. He looks
     over his shoulder, ANNE follows, close behind..

     Sharp branches tear at HENRY's face. Some draw blood. Behind
     him, several other COURTIERS suffer lashes from the branches,
     and pull up. But not ANNE. She kicks her horse harder. Seemingly
     impervious to the whipping branches..

                           ANNE
            Hah!

     Ahead, the DEER darts and weaves. The HOUNDS give chase.

      alf a mile ahead..

     A steep ravine, with a sheer drop of twenty-five feet deep. At
     the bottom, a brook with dangerous rocks, then another sheer
     climb of twenty-five feet the other side.

     The DEER arrives, looks, then scampers down the ravine, pursued
     by the HOUNDS.

      he remaining RIDERS arrive. They see the DEER scramble up the
     other side, followed by the DOGS, slipping in the mud, and
     struggling with the brook.

      everal DOGS fall. Yelping in fright and pain as they lose
     footing and fall on the rocks. The KING pulls up his horse..

     HENRY raises his hat, and salutes the DEER.

                          ENRY
             he King of England defeated by a humble
            fawn.

     The COURTIERS laugh, then they turn their horses around and head
     off. ANNE stares. It's a clear opportunity to impress. She looks
     down at the rocks. A long stare, then..

                         ANNE
                   (suddenly kicking horse)
            Hah!

     The COURTIERS gasp in disbelief as ANNE lurches forward, and
     leaps into space, heading fearlessly down the sheer ravine.

      orse and rider almost tumble down the vertiginous, lethal drop.
     But, reaching the bottom, the horse leaps across the brook, then
     scrambles up the other side.

     She made it! Exhilarated, ANNE turns, breathing hard. The KING
     stares at her. The COURTIERS stare at her.

         long silence. Nothing but the sound of wind in the trees..

                           COURTIER
              Please, your Majesty. It's not safe.

     HENRY turns and stares daggers at the COURTIER, `Silence'. He
     stares across the ravine at ANNE. Their eyes meet.

      hen he kicks his horse, `Hah!', and lurches forward. He heads
     down the sheer ravine. The COURTIERS gasp, rush to the edge of
     the ravine to watch. ANNE goes to the edge her side.

      ENRY's horse slides perilously down the ravine, then struggles
     to clear the brook, and lands heavily in the water.

       he KING struggles to keep control, and as the horse tries to
     scramble up the bank the other side, it loses it's footing in
     T
     the mud, it's hooves grasping horrifically at air..

      he COURTIERS cry out in horror, ANNE covers her mouth as..

     The KING's horse falls backwards, unseating HENRY, sending him
     flying, and worst of all, landing on top of him as they fall and
     tumble dreadfully down into the brook, and onto the rocks..

     Pandemonium breaks out. The sound of shouting voices, cries of
     horror, raising the alarm.

     ANNE's FACE: what has she done?

     HENRY slowly comes to, to find himself staring at a number of
     faces. A PHYSICIAN, SIR THOMAS BOLEYN, the DUKE of NORFOLK, one
     or two COURTIERS, and finally, ANNE..

                           PHYSICIAN
              It's a miracle, Majesty, you have no
              broken bones..

     HENRY flinches in agony, tries to move..

                           SIR THOMAS
              My daughter Anne is here. Would like to
              apologise.

                            ENRY
                     (recoils, his pride hurt)
              No! Get her away from me!

     ANNE opens her mouth, wants to protest, but is hastily ushered
     out of the room.

                    HENRY
       And who are you?

                    MARY
       Mary, your Grace. Anne's younger sister.

HENRY looks her up and down..

                    HENRY
       You've been here all week-end?

                    MARY
       Yes, your Grace.

                    HENRY
       Really? How could I have overlooked you?

                    MARY
       Next to Anne, it's easy to do.

                    HENRY
       Nonsense.

HENRY sits up, takes H better look. Intrigued.

                     ENRY (cont'd)

       Yes, your Grace. To William Carey.

                     ENRY
       From Wolsey's office?

                    MARY
       Yes, your Grace.

                    HENRY
       Then why haven't I seen you at court?

                    MARY
       Because I have persuaded him to spend a
       year or two here first. We have a small
       manor and some land. Nothing much. But
       enough to start a family.

                    HENRY
       A charmed life in the country? Away from
       it all?

                    MARY
       Yes.

     MARY lowers her eyes..

                         MARY
            But, if he ever changed his mind, I
            would always support him.

     HENRY stares at MARY.

            Well said.

     Strapped and bandaged, HENRY is helped onto his horse. Beside
     him GEORGE BOLEYN is also on a horse, riding off to court for
     the first time..

     SIR THOMAS and LADY ELIZABETH bow, curtsey farewell..

                         HENRY
            Thank you again, Lady Elizabeth. We'll

            You'll take care of that matter?

                         SIR THOMAS
            Consider it done, your Majesty.

     HENRY shoots a lingering look at MARY, which ANNE notices. Then
     the King and his entourage ride off.

     MARY and ANNE get to their feet. STAFFORD raises his hand..

                         STAFFORD
            Just Mary.

     MARY shoots ANNE a quizzical look, then goes with STAFFORD.

WILLIAM CAREY clears his throat. Avoids MARY's eyes..

       As Gentleman of the Privy Council.

MARY stares imploringly..

            I'm so sorry..

                         ANNE
            What for? You think I want the King? Or
            to be used and abused by him?
                   (puts on brave smile)
            No! You're welcome to him. I have my own
            plans, which don't involve becoming a
            rag that will one day be discarded.

     MARY stares, saddened, `Oh, Anne', but there's no time to talk.
     She has to go. ANNE is left. Her eyes blazing.

     MARY and WILLIAM ride through London streets escorted by
     SERVANTS bringing their belongings. They approach Whitehall
     Palace. Armed GUARDS slowly open the gates.

     MARY's face: as the heavy gates open. She shoots a last look at
     the `free' world outside. Then, she rides through the Palace
     gates.

     `CLANK', the heavy doors shut behind her.

     The outside world has been totally sealed off. Faces appear at
     palace windows, staring down at the `new arrivals'.

      mong them: is HENRY himself. He stares out of the window. Sees
     MARY. Then he lets the curtain fall.

     KATHERINE of ARAGON, (late-30's), imperious, intimidating,
     Spanish. Surrounded by other LADIES IN WAITING, (mostly high-
     born, Spanish, and the QUEEN's age). A SERVANT announces..

                         SERVANT
            Mary Carey, Ma'am.

     QUEEN KATHERINE looks up..`Who?'

                    QUEEN KATHERINE
       By my husband? Really?

The air crackles with tension. It's school bullying.

                    QUEEN KATHERINE
       Well, then she must be some kind of
       gift. He must have seen in her some
       special talent that would please me.
       Tell me. What special talent is it that
       you have?

        ..I'm afraid not. Your Majesty.

The Spanish GUITARIST obliges by starting to play a well-known
tune of the period..

       No..really..I beg you, your Majesty.

            I command you to SING!!!

     MARY flinches. Blushing deeply, her skin glowing with
     perspiration and terror, she begins to sing..

     Normally she sings well. But her voice now is strangled with
     fear. MARY stands rigid, her knuckles whiten, nails digging into
     her hands, drawing blood.

     Finally, MARY finishes. The room is silent. All eyes on
     KATHERINE, who stares coldly. A formidable adversary.

                         QUEEN KATHERINE
            Bravo! A nightingale!
                   (the cruel satisfaction of

     MARY walks through the packed corridors of court, her face
     burning from the humiliation. The sound of a voice behind her..

                         WOMAN'S VOICE
             ait! Mary! Stop!

     But MARY does not hear. She continues walking, distressed, and
     distractedly enters..

     Finally, she is caught by JANE PARKER, whom we had seen at the
     window earlier. Younger, also English, a kindred spirit..

                         JANE
            I know that must have been agony, but
            put yourself in her shoes. She knows the
            only reason the King has asked you here
            is because he desires you. For a wife
            that must be very difficult.

            She's a good woman. Trust me.

     JANE smiles. MARY manages a smile..

                           MARY
            Yes.

                         JANE
            I've seen him a few times at court. And
            like him...very well.

            But I don't think he has noticed me.

                   (a beat)
            Should I mention you to him?

                         MARY
            Of course. Happily.

      ANE PARKER smiles. But as soon as MARY's back is turned, the
     smile fades.

     A large dusty yard, where KNIGHTS train for combat, and practise
     their fighting skills. MARY is with GEORGE, who is putting on
     his armour..

                         GEORGE
            Not noticed her? Jane Parker? Of course
            I have. How could I not? She looks like
            a goat.

                         MARY
            Well, she likes you, and asked me to
            give you this..to remember her by.

     MARY hands over a handkerchief..

                         GEORGE
            Ugh. Well say you haven't seen me. Or
            that you forgot.

     GEORGE hastily gives it back..

                         GEORGE (cont'd)
            There is something about that woman that
            makes me feel...

     GEORGE gets to his feet, indicates to his MALE COURTIER friend

            And our sister? Any word?

                         GEORGE
            ANNE? You know she took being upstaged
            by you very badly.

                           MARY
            Yes, I know.

                         GEORGE
            And no amount of interventions on my
            behalf would make her believe you hadn't
            done it intentionally.

                         MARY
            But you KNOW I would never do anything
            like that.

                           GEORGE
            I know.

     GEORGE finds his helmet, puts it on..

                         GEORGE (cont'd)
            Just give her time. She'll come round.

     MARY watches GEORGE go to join the other MALE COURTIERS.

     MARY enters her room, and closes the door. She begins
     undressing, taking off her clothes, then catches sight of a DOG
     in the shadows. She gasps. It's the KING's dog.

                         HENRY (O.S.)
            Please, don't be alarmed.

      ENRY steps out of the shadows..

     MARY covers herself in modesty, and falls to her knees in a deep
     curtsey of deference. HENRY steps into the light, walks towards
     her..                H
                          ENRY
            I wanted to find somewhere we could be
            alone so I might say a few words to you
            in person.

      ENRY turns, looks around the room..

                         HENRY
            I hope your accommodation is
            comfortable. I realise it's no

                   (tailing off)
            What are you..?

     MARY's dress comes off her shoulder. The KING's eyes, however,
     instead of staring at MARY's beautiful, exposed body, stay
     focused on her eyes. An uncomfortable moment..

                         HENRY
            I am sorry.
                   (delicately putting her
                    clothes back on MARY)
            You obviously misunderstand me.

     MARY standing in the room..

     The DUKE of NORFOLK stares in disbelief at MARY. His dogs lie
     intimidatingly at his feet.

                         NORFOLK
            What? If all the King wanted was

            shoes.

                         MARY
            Your opinion, Uncle.

     MARY speaks quietly. Lowers her head..

                         MARY
            Mine is that it's the greatest insult of
            all.

                          ORFOLK
            What?

     An incense-filled Royal Chapel. The ARCHBISHOP is giving mass,
     in Latin, for the Royal Household.

      he King sits at the front, on the left. With the men. The
     ladies are separated, as is traditional, and sit on the right.

     HENRY is lost in prayer. It's not long, however, before he turns
     to look at MARY.

     Meanwhile, a remote country parish church. Far away.

       local PRIEST arrives. He sees two HORSES tethered to a tree by
     the side of the church. He dismounts. Checks no one has followed
     him.

      hen he enters the church.

     In the Royal chapel: the ARCHBISHOP solemnly performs the
     Eucharist, breaking bread and making wine from blood..

     But, in full view of all those in the chapel, the KING continues
     to stare at MARY.

      inally, she looks up. Their eyes meet. MARY blushes, averts her
     gaze. But then, for the first time, she reciprocates. And looks
     back.

     This is witnessed by the QUEEN, and further back, by the DUKE of
     NORFOLK and SIR THOMAS BOLEYN.

     Everyone is pretending to focus on the MASS. But none of them
     can concentrate..

     In the country church: The PRIEST's eyes become accustomed to
     the dark. Everywhere, long shadows, eerie darkness..

                         PRIEST
            Are you there?

     Presently, a WOMAN steps into the light. It's ANNE. Dressed in a
     shawl.

     ANNE hands over a purse of coins. They walk to the altar..

                         PRIEST
            And the groom? Is he here?

     Up ahead, the GROOM slowly steps out of the shadows. Now we see
     his face. It's HENRY PERCY.

            Good. Then let us begin.

     Back at court: the service ends.

     Everyone in the Royal Household filters out of the church. But
     it's a very different atmosphere to when they entered..

     The extent of HENRY's affection for MARY is now public knowledge
     evidenced by..

     ..the attention SIR THOMAS and NORFOLK now receive from CARDINAL
     WOLSEY and THOMAS CROMWELL, and the way in which QUEEN KATHERINE
     and her SPANISH LADIES are being neglected.

     MARY allows herself a private smile of satisfaction. Surprised
     at how good it feels. To be the number 1.

     MARY lies in bed, in a room covered in flowers. She admires a
     beautiful necklace in a box, and a handwritten letter from the
     KING. We can see from MARY's face how much she likes it.

     Presently, urgent `knock', `knock', at the door. MARY's eyes
     widen in excitement. The King?

     She hurriedly closes the necklace's box. Tucks the letter away
     in a drawer.

     She gets out of bed. Anxiously straightens her hair, then goes
     to the door, to find..

     GEORGE, her brother, who bursts in..

                         MARY
            George? It's the middle of the night.

               (horrified)
       What?

                    GEORGE
       In secret. Without telling anyone!

MARY's face falls..

                      MARY
       Oh, no...!

       You don't look pleased.

                    MARY
       Why would I be pleased?

                    GEORGE
       It would make her the future Duchess of
       Northumberland. Our sister!

                    MARY
       But they'll never allow it, don't you
       see? He's already precontracted to Mary
       Talbot, and if word of the consummation
       gets out her reputation will be ruined..

MARY pulls back her sheets..

                    MARY
       ...I have to tell Father. Before it's
       too late..

                      GEORGE

     INT. SIR THOMAS'S STUDY - BOLEYN HOUSE - LONDON - DAY
49                                                               49
     A FAMILY MEETING: ANNE and HENRY PERCY, (the HANDSOME YOUNG
     NOBLEMAN from Mary's wedding), stand in front of the DUKE of
     NORFOLK and SIR THOMAS BOLEYN and GEORGE..

                         SIR THOMAS
            What were you thinking? The marriage of
            a senior noble is a matter of state.
            Something only the King can decide..

     HENRY PERCY looks down, avoiding eye contact..

                         NORFOLK
            Who knows about this?

                         ANNE
            No one.

                         NORFOLK
            Then that is how it shall remain.
            Forever.

                         ANNE
            But you cannot undo what has been done
            before God.
                   (defiant stare)
            And consummated too.

     `Snap', NORFOLK's quill breaks. SIR THOMAS almost chokes.
     GEORGE's eyes widen..

                         NORFOLK
            WHAT?

                         SIR THOMAS
                   (struggling to contain his
                    anger)
            There have been improper intimacies,
            too?

                         ANNE
            I have lain with my husband. There is
            nothing improper about it..

                         NORFOLK
            SILENCE! My God, if you were my daughter
            I'd thrash you within an inch of your
            life..

     ANNE recoils, terrified..

                         SIR THOMAS
            The boy will return to Northumberland -
            where he will marry the Talbot girl. As
            arranged.

     SIR THOMAS gives the signal for WILLIAM STAFFORD to escort PERCY
     out.

                          ORFOLK
            As for you. You will go to France and
            stay there until you have learned your
            lesson.

                         MARY
            What?

                          ORFOLK
            How could you do this to your sister?
            You know full well her friendship with
            the King is at an extremely delicate
            stage. Any scandal or black mark against
            Mary's name now could be fatal.

     SIR THOMAS dismisses her..

                         NORFOLK
            You will join the court of the French
            Queen. And stay there until your father
            has forgiven you.

     ANNE goes. GEORGE follows..


     INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE - DAY

     MARY paces anxiously in the corridor. Presently, ANNE emerges
     from the room. Burning with humiliation. Their eyes meet. MARY
     is about to speak, but ANNE cuts her off..

                         ANNE

            How COULD you?

                         MARY
            Because you would never have got away
            with it. And it would have ruined your
            prospects forever.
                   (a beat)
            Believe me. I did it for your good.

                         ANNE
            Really? For MY good? I'll try to remind
            myself of that. While I'm in exile. And
            you're here, in the King's bed, and
            unchallenged for our father's affection.
                    a beat)
            That it was for MY good. Not yours.

                         MARY
            ANNE, wait..!

     ANNE storms out. GEORGE shoots MARY a look, "I'll deal with
     this", and runs after ANNE..

     OVER THIS: we fade in MUSIC and the sound of laughter..


     INT. BALL-ROOM - PALACE - NIGHT
 1                                                               51
     A grand MASQUE BALL. We're in a spectacular candle-lit ballroom.
     MUSICIANS play. Large formations of DANCERS perform elaborately
     choreographed moves. Among them we pick out..

     SIR THOMAS BOLEYN stalking the party. Ever watchful. On duty.
     Vigilant. He is distracted by the sight of...

     His son, GEORGE BOLEYN, surrounded by FRANCIS WESTON and his
     FRIENDS. GEORGE is clearly in his element. Laughing in delight.
     Very fond and intimate with FRANCIS WESTON..

     SIR THOMAS looks concerned for the first time.

      n another corner, MARY is in costume, but looking forlorn. She
     watches proceedings with a blank, distant expression. Presently,
     a voice behind her..

                         MASKED MAN
            Why look so glum, Mary?

     MARY turns to see a MASKED MAN behind her.

                         MARY
            What reason have I to be happy?

                         MASKED MAN
             ou have two men, the King of England
            and I, both fighting for your love.

     The MASKED MAN is tall. His voice is quiet, but strong.

                         MARY
            Do I know you?

                         MASKED MAN
            You know me, Mary - but not half as well
            as I know you. I know you better than
            anyone here. And love you better than
            anyone here, too. And if God had made ME
            your husband instead of William Carey,
            one thing I know..
                   (a beat)
            I would never have let you go.

     MARY's smile fades..

                         MARY
            Wait! Who ARE you?

MARY lunges for the MAN's MASK to try and remove it, but the MAN
retreats into the safety of the shadows. Meanwhile..

All around MARY the crowds part, and a deep voice booms out.

                     ASKED MAN #2
       Ah! Who have we here?!?

MARY turns to see a SECOND MASKED MAN, (unmistakably the KING),
surrounded by COURTIERS.
                     M
                    MARY
       My name is Kindness.

                      MASKED MAN #2
           wonder, will you be kind to me?

                    MARY
       What is it you desire?

                    MASKED MAN #2
        our love, fair Lady.

                    MARY
       You demand a great deal.

                    MASKED MAN #2
       No more than I would give in return.

MARY notices her FATHER is among the masked COURTIERS. His eyes
giving MARY cues..

                    MARY
       It is easy for a man to declare love
       from behind a mask.

                     ASKED MAN #2
        ut if I remove it, you might reject me.

                    MARY
       If your feelings were sincere, I would
       never reject you.

                    MASKED MAN #2
       But you do not know who I am? I could be
       ugly. Or poor.

                    MARY
        o matter how you looked. Or who you
       were.

                    MASKED MAN #2
       Really? Then I shall hold you to your
       word. And unmask..!

With a flourish, the KING rips off his mask..

                         MARY
            Your Majesty..!

     SIR THOMAS urgently nods, `Go on!' MARY theatrically swoons.
     Falling into the KING's arms. A gasp among the COURTIERS..

                         HENRY
             he faints! Quick! Take her to my rooms!
            Call my physicians..!

     SIR THOMAS quickly picks MARY up. He carries her through the
     crowds, out of the ball-room..

     QUEEN KATHERINE watches from a distance. A flicker of pain.
     Then, with great dignity and pride, she turns back to watch the
     entertainment..


     INT. KING'S APARTMENT - COURT - NIGHT
52                                                             52
     `Thump', the doors open, and MARY is carried into the King's
     apartments. HENRY fusses, brings water. Opens windows.

                          ENRY
            Go! Leave us! Go!

     SIR THOMAS bows to the KING, shoots MARY meaningful look, `Don't
     fail me', and retreats. HENRY closes the doors. He and MARY are
     left alone.

     HENRY makes her comfortable.

                         MARY
            Thank you, your Grace.

                         HENRY
            `Henry', please. The first rule of this
            room, is to leave `Your Grace's' and
            `Your Majesty's' outside.

      ENRY looks up..

                         HENRY
            Is there anything I can bring you?

                         MARY
            No.

                         HENRY
            Nothing to increase your comfort or well-
            being?

                         MARY
            You might ask your servants to bring me
            some water.

     HENRY goes to get water himself..

                    HENRY
       There. There ARE no servants.

MARY's eyes widen. The KING of ENGLAND brings her a drink! MARY
takes a sip of her drink and watches as HENRY goes behind a
screen and begins to remove his costume. His mask.

MARY notices a mirror, and watches in the reflection of the
mirror how HENRY removes the costume and status of KING and
becomes a MAN. Private.

 ENRY visibly unwinds, his facial muscles relax. He breathes out
deeply. His face becomes softer. More gentle. Then he puts on a
comfortable robe, and emerges from behind the screen.

HENRY goes over to a pile of cushions, and flops down - and
smiles at MARY.

                    MARY
       So, this is it? This is where the King
       of England sleeps?

                    HENRY
       And reads. And writes. And finds a few
       moments each day...
              (gestures)
       ...for himself.

HENRY smiles at MARY..

                    HENRY (cont'd)
       You look surprised?

                    MARY
       I am. I suppose it's more..

MARY looks at the bed, the books, the pages of writing on the
desk..

                    MARY
       ..simple than I imagined.

                     ENRY
       There's no need for show. I am only ever
       here alone.

                    MARY
       And yet you invite me here?

                    HENRY
       Because I trust you.

                    MARY
       You hardly know me.

       You would never lie, could never lie to

MARY smiles, admitting he's right.

       No.

                    HENRY
       I also sense...that you might relish an
       opportunity to be yourself, too.

                    MARY
       Yes.

                    HENRY
       Well, here you only say what you like,
       do what you like.
                    M
                    MARY
       Very well.

MARY smiles. Stretches out her legs. Relaxes..

                    MARY
       I'd like an apple, please..
              (can't believe she's saying
               this)
       ..Henry.

HENRY jumps to his feet, brings MARY an apple. MARY laughs,
`Thank you'. Bites into the apple..

                    MARY
       Now it's your turn.

                    HENRY
       What?

                    MARY
       To say something, or do something you
       couldn't outside.

                    HENRY
       There are many things I cannot admit to
       in public. Sadness, for example. And
       loneliness.

                    MARY
       But when you are loved as much as you
       are? How can you be lonely?

            in a marriage?

                         MARY
            Yes. I do now.

                          ENRY
              married my brother's widow because my
            father ordered it. As a duty. To keep
            the alliance with Spain. And she is a
            remarkable woman. And wife.

     HENRY looks at MARY..

                         HENRY
            But I never looked at her or longed for
            her the way I do you.

     HENRY reaches out. Their hands meet..

                         HENRY
            Imagine how different it might have
            been. For both of us..had we been able
            to chose for ourselves..

     HENRY leans forward and they kiss. Gently at first. MARY
     resisting. Then harder..

      ensing this, the KING picks MARY up and leads her to the
     canopied bed, and lays her down..

     They begin to make love. As radical a contrast to the scene with
     WILLIAM CAREY as it is possible to imagine..

     MARY's eyes open. She gasps. Her hands grip the sheets..

     Several hours later:

     WILLIAM STAFFORD is fast asleep in a window seat in the corridor
     outside. Finally, the door opens. And MARY emerges from the
     KING's apartment.

                             TAFFORD
            Good morning.

            I have orders to bring you to your

     MARY stares at STAFFORD. As he straightens his shirt..

                         MARY
            My father..?

            Well, we'd better not keep him waiting.

     The DUKE of NORFOLK's dogs are eating breakfast out of bowls by
     the fire. Slurping hungrily.

     The entire family is gathered. SIR THOMAS, LADY ELIZABETH. Also
     present is WILLIAM CAREY.

                          NORFOLK
            Well..?

     MARY stares at her husband..

                         NORFOLK
            Did he have you?

     MARY's eyes burn..

                          MARY
            Yes.

                         NORFOLK
            More than once?

     MARY stares daggers..

                         NORFOLK
            You'd better get used to talking about
            it. Once you sleep with the king, it's
            not a private matter any more.

                         MARY
            Yes. More than once.

     WILLIAM CAREY's face: a flicker of pain..

                         NORFOLK
            So he was satisfied?

                         MARY
            I believe so, Uncle.

                         NORFOLK
             ood. This is where our work begins.
            It's one thing to catch the king. Quite
            another to keep him.

     NORFOLK turns to SIR THOMAS, ignoring MARY as though she were a
     piece of livestock..

                         NORFOLK
            I want you to keep her spotless, hair
            washed every day. She must read all the
            latest books and be able to venture and
            defend an interesting opinion. She must
            know her music, must be energetic and
            entertaining - in company and in bed.
            That's how he likes his women. And if
            ever she's in any doubt as to how to
            conduct herself, or what to do next -
            she should simply watch the Queen. That
            woman kept him from straying for eleven
            years. And the effort almost killed her.

      ut SIR THOMAS has not heard. He is distracted. He watches from
     a palace window as, in a stableyard down below..

     GEORGE and FRANCIS WESTON return from riding together. The sound
     of laughter as they dismount, and hand their horses to the
     stable-boys..

     SIR THOMAS watches as GEORGE and FRANCIS walk back to the palace
     together. There's something in their manner, the intimacy
     between them..

     SIR THOMAS's smile fades.

     `Slap', HENRY spreads out a huge architect's drawing of a
     magnificent ship on a table. He sits with SIR THOMAS BOLEYN and
     the DUKE of NORFOLK.

                         HENRY
            The biggest warship in the fleet. Thirty-
            two guns and two hundred feet long, and

            ..I'd like to name her after your
            daughter. The "Mary Boleyn".

        onsense. She's an angel. It's the least
       she deserves. And if there's anything
       else I can do for YOU, my friend..as an
       expression of my gratitude..let me know.

SIR THOMAS's tails off. Thinking..

                    SIR THOMAS
        s it happens..there is one thing.

                    HENRY
       Name it.

SIR THOMAS has clearly not stopped thinking about what he saw
between GEORGE and FRANCIS WESTON..

                    SIR THOMAS
        ur son, George. He's of an age now..

                    HENRY
       You want me to make him a match?

SIR THOMAS bows. Deadly serious..

                    SIR THOMAS
       Yes, your Majesty.

                    HENRY
       Do you have anyone in mind?

                    SIR THOMAS
       There is one lady, Sir..

                    HENRY
       Go on..

                    SIR THOMAS
       Who I fear is too high-born for us. And
       following the unfortunate matter between
       Anne and Henry Percy, I didn't want my
       children to overreach themselves again..

                    HENRY
        verreach themselves?

HENRY can't help smiling..

                    HENRY
       One is currently in the King's bed. If
       they are good enough for me, I suggest
       they're good enough for anyone else.
       So..

     of his father.

                          EORGE
            I beg you, Father. No.

                         SIR THOMAS
            She's well connected, her father is
            cousin to the King. And there's money,
            too.

                         GEORGE
            But must I actually...marry her?

                         SIR THOMAS
              thought you had ambitions for this

            yourself. Not just stand back and watch

      EORGE nods..

                         SIR THOMAS
            Then my advice would be to start
            behaving like a man. A real man. Do I
            make myself clear?

     MUSICIANS play. We're at GEORGE's wedding. Attended by the KING
     and QUEEN, all the senior LORDS. It's a markedly grander and
     posher affair than MARY's earlier wedding, a clear indication of
     the BOLEYNS' new, elevated status.

A formation dance is in progress. At the centre of it: GEORGE
dances with a radiant, triumphant JANE PARKER. GEORGE's eyes
meet those of FRANCIS WESTON across the room.

 y contrast: HENRY dances with MARY. A couple with eyes on for
each other. Locked to one another. Blissfully unaware of and
uninterested in anyone else. Silently counting the minutes
before they can tear off one another's clothes..

 EVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL:

Their intimacy is witnessed by WILLIAM CAREY, who we notice is
now drinking heavily, drowning his jealous sorrows..

ELSEWHERE:

SIR THOMAS BOLEYN is dancing with his wife, LADY ELIZABETH. He
hisses through a fixed smile..

                    SIR THOMAS
       For God's sake, it's the wedding of our
       youngest child attended by the King of
       England and the greatest Lords in the
       Land. Would a smile be too much to ask?

                    LADY ELIZABETH
       What's to smile about? I'm a mother with
       one child on his wedding day looking
       like he's been condemned to death.

 he indicates GEORGE, who dances with JANE PARKER..

                    LADY ELIZABETH
       Another banished abroad, in disgrace.
       And a third whoring in public with an
       adulterer.

                    SIR THOMAS
       For the moment she's happy.

SIR THOMAS watches MARY who dances with the KING..

                    LADY ELIZABETH
       But will she be happy when he leaves
       her? Because you know that's how it will
       end.

                    SIR THOMAS
       Only God knows how anything will end.

                    LADY ELIZABETH
       God..? He turned his back on all this a
       long time ago.

SIR THOMAS stares coldly at his wife. He applauds as the dance
comes to an end.

     IN ANOTHER CORNER:

     MARY and the KING also clap. HENRY whispers sexily in MARY's
     ear. She laughs. Then HENRY is called to one side...

     MARY is momentarily left alone. She looks up to see WILLIAM
     CAREY standing in front of her, swaying slightly.

                         WILLIAM
            You're in love with him, aren't you?

                         MARY
             illiam, you're drunk.

                         WILLIAM
            How is it? With him?

     MARY stares - suddenly hard - punishing him.

                         MARY
            He pleases me. Is that what you want to
            hear?

                         WILLIAM
            What does he do to you? Tell me. I want
            to know..

     MARY pulls away. But CAREY pulls her roughly to one side. HENRY
     sees this from across the room..

                         WILLIAM
            I know you look at me with contempt.
            But I had no choice. Your father
            insisted I stand aside. What was I
            expected to do?

                         MARY
            Say `no', husband.
                   (a beat)
            That was all you had to do.

     MARY pulls her arm away, and goes. She walks across the room,
     visibly shaken, and joins the KING.

     HENRY and MARY make love. Two people giving everything of
     themselves..

     Hours later: they lie together, enveloped in one another's arms.
     MARY is awake. The King asleep in her arms. She lovingly strokes
     his hair. Watches him breathe.

     Her face is glowing. Content. And the look in her eyes tells us
     more eloquently and unequivocally than any sonnet..

     The sound of groaning. Wretching. Shooting through a half-open
     door, we see MARY hunched over her basin, vomiting.
     P
      resently, she emerges from the bathroom. White-faced. Her hands
     instinctively covering her belly.

     MARY's eyes widen with the implications.

            Are you certain?

                         MARY
            Yes.

     Shooting through a half-open door..

     SIR THOMAS and the DUKE of NORFOLK are having a private audience
     with the KING. SIR THOMAS whispers something in HENRY's ear..

     (WE DO NOT HEAR THE WORDS - WE DO NOT NEED TO).

     HENRY's face breaks out in a smile. He delightedly shakes SIR
     THOMAS's hand. OVER THIS: the sound of a voice..

     MARY removes her blindfold. She gasps in disbelief, turns 360
     degrees, staring at the size, and grandeur of the location..

                         SIR THOMAS
            There's more. Thanks to you, I am to
            become an Earl. Your brother a Viscount.

      EORGE smiles at MARY, who's eyes widen..

                         SIR THOMAS (cont'd)
            In addition, we have received a number
            of new grants and estates.
                    pointedly, to LADY
                    ELIZABETH)
            So our debts are paid off.

     But LADY ELIZABETH remains granite-faced..

                         LADY ELIZABETH
            Just be aware. These `gifts', this
            `favour' can go as swiftly as it comes.
            These rooms belonged to the Duke of
            Buckingham. Once the King's closest
            friend. Now his head rots on a spike..

                         SIR THOMAS
            Because he committed treason.

                          ADY ELIZABETH
            But what is `treason'? It's anything the
            King or his lawyers decide it to be.
            Anything that offends him, or causes him
            displeasure.
                    a beat)
            And can you assure me we'll never do
            that?

     LADY ELIZABETH turns and walks out. MARY looks anxiously at SIR
     THOMAS, who gestures dismissively..

                         SIR THOMAS
            Pay her no heed..

     MARY wakes up. She gets out of bed. She goes to the window and
     draws the curtains.

     Then MARY looks down, and gasps. The floor has fresh drops of
     blood on it.

     MARY goes to her bed, and rips back the sheets. Her eyes widen
     in horror. There is blood all over the sheets.

     MARY covers her mouth. Lets out a loud cry. The sound of
     approaching footsteps as SERVANTS come running..

     MARY lies on the bed being examined by several PHYSICIANS. SIR
     THOMAS and the DUKE of NORFOLK look on in concern. Finally, the
     PHYSICIAN turns, washing his hands..

                         PHYSICIAN
            Happily, the baby lives. She's not
            miscarried.

            But the placenta is weak. For the sake
            of the child..

     The PHYSICIAN clears his throat. This will not be easy..

                         PHYSICIAN
            She must begin her lying-in immediately.

                           MARY
                     (horrified)
            What?

     MARY looks up. Her heart sinks.

                         MARY
            But I'm only three months..


66                                                                66
     INT. MARY'S BEDROOM - COURT - DAY

     MARY lies in her bed, watching with a forlorn expression as
     MIDWIVES and MAIDS prepare the apartment for lying-in.

      APESTRIES with soothing biblical images are hung on the walls.
     CURTAINS are drawn for darkness. A large CRUCIFIX is placed in a
     corner.

     As each TAPESTRY is hung, the room becomes darker...

     ..and darker.

     ..and darker.

     MARY cranes her neck to remain in sunlight for as long as
     possible, but before long..

     ..her face slips into darkness, and the room into total silence.
     And effective imprisonment.

     Darkness. The KING stands at the foot of MARY's bed. He is
     clearly uncomfortable in these `maternal' surroundings..

                         HENRY
             ou poor girl. All alone in here. But
            the time will fly by.

                         MARY
            Will it? It's six months?

                         HENRY
            I know. But the most important thing is
            a healthy child.

      ENRY takes MARY's hand..

                         HENRY (cont'd)

     INT. COURT - DAY

     The KING's birthday. The MASTER OF REVELS has organised a lavish
     ball. The entire court is assembled and dancing, but HENRY
     appears sullen, distant. Unable to celebrate.

     He misses MARY.

      he QUEEN has several of her prettiest SPANISH LADIES-IN WAITING
     surrounding the KING. Giggling, fragrant butterflies.

     But HENRY shows no interest.

     The DUKE of NORFOLK notices this. A flicker of concern.

     An archery competition is in progress. But HENRY pays no
     attention. He sits listlessly to one side. Ill-tempered and
     missing MARY.

      mong the GUESTS are SIR JOHN SEYMOUR and his CHILDREN. They
     notice the KING, all alone. They talk among themselves.

     Sensing an opportunity, SIR JOHN SEYMOUR advances, and presents
     his pretty daughter JANE to the KING.

     The DUKE of NORFOLK, (never far away), notices how modestly and
     demurely young JANE SEYMOUR flirts.

     She has been well trained.

     But she makes no impact on HENRY. He waves the SEYMOURS away.
     Not remotely interested.

      or the moment.

     The KING is visiting MARY. He sits by her bed. They hold hands
     and are talking intimately.

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

     This is being watched by the DUKE of NORFOLK, and SIR THOMAS
     BOLEYN. NORFOLK's face is dark and brooding..

                         NORFOLK
            For the moment he's still visiting Mary.
            But for how long? The Queen will soon
            have his head spinning with pretty
            little Spanish things. Not to mention
            the Seymours with that girl of theirs.

     NORFOLK looks up...

                         NORFOLK
            What we need is someone from OUR family
            who will keep the King focused on Mary,
            reminding him of her while she is
            absent.

     SIR THOMAS is about to speak, then changes his mind.

                         NORFOLK
            What? Speak..

                         SIR THOMAS
            It's just...I was going to suggest Anne.

                         NORFOLK
            You couldn't control that girl last
            time. What makes you think it would be
            any different now?

                         SIR THOMAS
            I've had favourable reports from the
            Dowager Queen in France. It seems she is
            quite changed.

     MARY sits up. Her eyes widen in horror..

                         MARY
            Why?

     Sitting beside her in the darkness, is her brother GEORGE..

                         GEORGE
            I suppose they felt three years of exile
            was punishment enough.

                         MARY
            But the King visits me every day.
            There's no need for her. Or anyone else.

                         GEORGE
            They just want to protect you. Leave
            nothing to chance.

                         MARY
            But in who's interests do they imagine
            Anne will act? Certainly not mine.

     GEORGE turns, looks all around him..

                         GEORGE (cont'd)
            Why DO they make this room such a
            dungeon? Does it really need to be this
            dark?

     GEORGE notices MARY's vexed expression..

                         GEORGE
            Don't worry. She's had three years to
            forgive you. And she's not going to risk
            being sent away again. She'll do as
            she's told, I'm sure.
                   (a beat)
            Besides, the most important thing is..

     GEORGE moves MARY's lips into an upward shape..

                         GEORGE
            The three of us will be together again.

     MARY's lips: a reluctant, unconvincing smile..

     with foreign AMBASSADORS. Presently, at the other end of the
     table, loud laughter.
     H
      ENRY looks up, then returns to his conversation.

     It's not long before another loud gale of laughter in the corner
     of the room. HENRY looks up again. Then returns to his
     conversation.

      resently, a third roar of laughter at the other end. This time,
     HENRY loses patience..

                         HENRY
            What's the noise? I can hardly hear
            myself think!

     At the other end, a COURTIER gets to his feet..

                         BRANDON
            It's Mistress Boleyn, your Majesty. Her
            stories about life at the French court.
            They are particularly amusing.

     HENRY's expression changes. The room falls silent..

            I'm only aware of one Boleyn girl and
            she is lying-in with a certain child in
            her belly!

SIR THOMAS BOLEYN gets to his feet..

                    SIR THOMAS
       It's my elder daughter, Anne, your
       Majesty. She has returned to court.

                    HENRY
       What? That awful girl, Thomas? The one
       that almost killed me?
              (a beat)
       You allowed her back?

                    SIR THOMAS
       The time abroad has done her good, your
       Majesty. I'm certain you'd find her much
       improved.

                      HENRY
       Really..?

HENRY looks down the table..

                    HENRY
       Well, come on. Where are you, other
       Boleyn girl? Show your face.

ANNE slowly gets to her feet. HENRY looks up. When he sees
ANNE's face, his face falls..

ANNE is a woman transformed. Gone are the simple clothes, puppy
fat and lack of confidence.

ANNE has become a glorious, head-turning siren; dressed in
daring French clothes.

 er hood is half-crescent, and reveals the hair. Her neckline
plunges sexily. Her sleeves are long and loose, offering daring
flashes of arm and elbow..

Like every other red-blooded MAN in the room, HENRY is utterly
mesmerised. Speechless..

                    HENRY
       So? What is so amusing, Anne? Perhaps we
       might hear and judge for ourselves?

ANNE dark, intelligent eyes stare back at HENRY. Suddenly, all
sound fades, and the world shrinks around them: it's as though
they are the only two people in the room..

                    ANNE
       I was just giving my thoughts on the new
       French King.

                      HENRY
       Which are..?

                    ANNE
       That for someone with such great wealth,
       and power..he has surprisingly little
       authority as a man.

                    HENRY
       Hah!

                    ANNE
       And is SO consumed by one particular
       rivalry he can barely think.

                    HENRY
        eally? And who is this rival?

                    ANNE
       A neighbouring King, who's name one is
       forbidden to mention at court. Whose
       reputation haunts him in his thoughts
       and dreams.

 ipples of laughter, as people guess..

                    ANNE
       Whose armies and navy thwart his every
       endeavour. Whose physical and
       intellectual endowments are known far
       and wide.

 ENRY laughs too. Enjoying this..

                    ANNE
       In order to restore his confidence, this
       French King spends a fortune on anything
       that glitters, on building of castles
       with large towers..

ANNE artfully gestures the phallic implications..

                    ANNE
       But these symbols of wealth and virility
       fail to convince. Talk among the ladies
       at court in France suggests..
A
ANNE stops herself...

                    HENRY
       What?

                    ANNE
       That in this department too, the King
       has his shortcomings.

ANNE's gesture, (discreetly wiggling her small finger). HENRY
stares for a moment. A deathly silence. Has she gone too far?

     Then HENRY smiles. Delighted. DOGS bark in bewilderment. Soon
     everyone in the room laughs too.

      xcept for the SEYMOURS, (SIR JOHN and his sons, EDWARD and
     THOMAS), who glower, mute, at the end of the table beside their
     sister JANE..

            of the way, they had a real opportunity
            with that pale-faced thing of theirs,
            Jane...

     SIR THOMAS smiles as he remembers..

                         SIR THOMAS (cont'd)
            But Anne put pay to that. Last night,
            the King only had eyes for us Boleyns.

     MARY shoots a private, knowing look..

                         MARY
            Or HER, you mean.

                         SIR THOMAS
            What?

                         MARY
             'm wary of any suggestion that Anne
            would serve anyone but herself. France
            can't have changed her THAT much.

                         SIR THOMAS
             n this occasion I am quite satisfied
            she was being loyal to you.

                         MARY
            Really?

     MARY stares hollow-eyed..

                         MARY (cont'd)
            Then ask yourself this. If she is really
            so concerned for my well-being...

     AFTERWARDS: HENRY and his COURTIERS, (among them GEORGE), are
     being undressed and washed by their PAGES and SQUIRES..

                         HENRY
            You're a fortunate man, George. To be
            blessed with G
                         two such sisters.

                            EORGE
            Yes, my Lord.

     There is a powerful physicality, a sexual confidence to HENRY
     which he exudes, even among men. He moves closer to GEORGE.

                          ENRY
            Tell me. Are they as different in temper
            as they are in looks?

                         GEORGE
            Oh, yes. Each has her own, quite
            distinct virtues. Mary for example..

                         HENRY
            I'm familiar with Mary's. Tell me about
            Anne's.

                         GEORGE
            Anne? Well, she's strong. Some might say
            `difficult'.

                          ENRY
            Headstrong. With a fiery temper.

                         GEORGE
            But with it comes great passion, too.
            It's both the best and the worst thing
            about her.
                    a beat)
            There are no half measures with Anne.

                         HENRY
            Careful, you'll make me think I chose
            the wrong Boleyn girl.

                         GEORGE
            Oh, no. I'm certain Mary is the   right
            choice. You will have a serene,   happy,
            life with her. The risk is with   Anne, it
            might be like being caught in a   wild
            summer storm.

                         HENRY
            Is that so..?

     GEORGE has tried to put HENRY off. But might just have said the
     wrong thing.

                           HENRY

     A small, precious-looking GIFT BOX sits on a table.

                          ERVANT
            From the King, madam.

     ANNE looks at the box. Her heart misses a beat. It carries the
     unmistakable royal seal.

                          ANNE
            Open it.

     A SERVANT stares..

                         ANNE
            I said `open it.'

     The SERVANT opens it. Other SERVANTS crane their necks, stand on
     tiptoes. Inside is a large pearl pendant. The SERVANT gasps.
     ANNE, too. Covers her mouth. It's beautiful..

     But from somewhere, she manages to find the strength..

                         ANNE
            Now close it again. And send it back.

     The SERVANT stares in disbelief..

                         ANNE (cont'd)
            You heard me.

     The SERVANT bows, and leaves, taking the box. ANNE watches, a
     look of mischief in her eyes. She's up to no good.

     `Crash', the KING, flanked by several of his most intimidating

     The KING bursts in. Everyone leaps to their feet. SERVANTS stop
     and stare and curtsey. LADY ELIZABETH bows, clearly thrown..

                         LADY ELIZABETH
            Your Majesty.

     HENRY turns full circle, looking for someone..

     ANNE hears the KING's voice. Her eyes widen. She looks down.
     Sees HENRY. ANNE smiles privately - it's confirmation that her
     strategy has worked.

                         ANNE
             ecause my sister lies in bed with your
            child. If you wish to please me, Sir,
            then send her the gifts you send me.

                         HENRY
            I have shown Mary enough kindness and
            generosity. It's you I want, Anne.

              beg you, my Lord, do not do this. What

     MARY cries out in pain. The contractions become stronger.
     MIDWIVES and PHYSICIANS urgently do their business. Pots of

       He's on his way.

ANNE, who overhears this, surreptitiously adjusts her dress.

MARY screams in agony. The labour is well and truly under way.
Medically, it's a primitive, brutal affair..

No comprehension of sterilisation. MIDWIVES have dirty hands.
PHYSICIANS use rusty, blood-stained instruments..

Presently: the KING arrives with several COURTIERS..

                    SIR THOMAS
       Any moment, your Grace.

But the KING hasn't heard. He has seen ANNE. Suddenly, it's as
if all sound, all vision disappears, except for ANNE. He stands
beside her..

All around them the violence and dramatic activity of the birth
unfolding; but for all their connection with it, HENRY and ANNE
might as well be in a rose garden..

                    HENRY
       Anne..

ANNE stares ahead at MARY's bed..

NORFOLK cranes his neck to listen..

                    ANNE
       When I have seen how you have betrayed
       first your wife. And now my sister.

HENRY takes ANNE to one side...

       I vow from this moment forth I will
       never lie with my wife, or speak to your

                                                           65.


MARY's contractions build. Birth is imminent. PHYSICIANS and
MIDWIVES work to deliver the baby. ANNE thinks, then..

                    ANNE
       Then don't acknowledge the child.

HENRY is thrown..

                    HENRY
       What?

With a blood-curdling scream, MARY finally gives birth. SIR
THOMAS and NORFOLK crowd into the room, anxious to see..

                    PHYSICIAN
       A boy!

SIR THOMAS turns towards HENRY, beaming with happiness..

                    SIR THOMAS
       It's a boy, your Majesty. A strong,
       healthy boy.

HENRY's face: a boy? His eyes fill with emotion. This is what he
has waited for. A son.

ANNE notices his conflict, and prompts him again..

                    ANNE
       What my sister has given you, I could,
       too.

HENRY looks at the BABY, then turns to face ANNE. His eyes are
full of conflict, then..he silently nods.

ANNE's face breaks out in a smile..

                    ANNE
       Very well.

Then, in front of everyone, not caring how inappropriate it is,
HENRY falls to his knee, takes ANNE's hand and kisses it.

The audible sound of gasps. MARY watches in horror as HENRY
falls to his knees and kisses ANNE's hand..
                     M
                    MARY
              (a dagger in her heart)
       Henry..?

HENRY gets to his feet, then turns and walks away without
looking in the direction of MARY or the BABY.

                    MARY (cont'd)
       My Lord..?

MARY stares after the KING, but he does not turn around.

     Instead, MARY's eyes meet ANNE's.

     ANNE's eyes stare back. The ultimate moment of revenge.

       barely perceptible smile of satisfaction, then ANNE turns and
     goes.

     The MIDWIVES and PHYSICIANS stare at one another, visibly
     embarrassed by what they have just witnessed.

     The clearing of throats, averting of eyes. Then they get on with
     their work to the sound of the MARY's cries..


     INT. SIR THOMAS'S STUDY - NIGHT

     `Crash', SIR THOMAS and NORFOLK burst into the study, angrily
     slamming the door closed behind them. ANNE is inside.

                         NORFOLK
            Damn you! Three years we've been working
            on this! Not a single detail was left to
            chance! And now, in the moment of our
            greatest glory..

     NORFOLK stares at ANNE..

                         NORFOLK
            All I can say is you'd better have a
            plan. And it had better work.

     ANNE stares back defiantly..

                         ANNE
            Or what...Uncle?

                         LADY ELIZABETH
            Stop it! Both of you. What shall we do
            about Mary? And the child? Or have we
            forgotten them already?

                         ANNE
            Mary should go back to her husband.

     Not a flicker of emotion on her face.

                         ANNE
            She has been inconvenienced long enough
            by this family.

                          ADY ELIZABETH
            Fine. Then you can be the one to tell
            her.

      ADY ELIZABETH stares at ANNE..

                          LADY ELIZABETH

      ANNE stares into the room through a crack in the doorway.

      A flicker of doubt. What has she done? To her own sister?

      ANNE checks herself. Enough sentiment. She swallows it.

       nd enters.


      INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY

      MARY looks up as ANNE enters, and freezes..

                          MARY
             How can you show your face in here?

                          ANNE
             I understand you're angry - but be
             assured. I did nothing, except remind
             him of you.

                          MARY
             Oh, spare me. You did this deliberately.
             As revenge.
                    (a beat)
             And now you have what you wanted you
             probably think justice has been done.

                          ANNE
             Well, hasn't it?

                          MARY
             Be careful, that's my advice. Learn from
             my experience. Because he'll only do to
             you what he has done to me.

                          ANNE
             Never. I'll make sure he understands I'm
             a greater thing by far. That he can
             never have me until he makes me a far
             greater offer.

                          MARY
             You'll never get Henry Percy back, if
             that's what you mean.

                          ANNE
             That's not what I mean.

      ANNE's eyes burn with anger..

                          ANNE
             And don't you ever mention his name to
             me again. I'll never forget how you
             betrayed me.

                          MARY
             If that's what you think, fine. Tell
             yourself that.

                          ANNE
             I did, sister. Every day for three
             years.

      ANNE turns, and walks out.

      MARY is leaving COURT. Pale. Weak. Her belongings have been
      packed into boxes. Ahead of her, the BABY is being carried by
      MIDWIVES, led by WILLIAM STAFFORD.

      MARY walks across a courtyard, then stops in her tracks.

       VER BY THE STABLES: the KING and ANNE are mounting horses to go
      riding together. HENRY lifts ANNE up into the saddle behind him,
      (how she has learned!). ANNE holds tight, her arms wrapped
      around his waist..

      At that moment, ANNE looks over and sees MARY. Their eyes meet.
      They stare for a beat, then..

      ANNE kicks HENRY's horse, `Hah!', and they ride out. Galloping
      into the distance.

      MARY's face: fighting to hold onto her dignity. WILLIAM STAFFORD
      watches her, his eyes burning with sympathy.

      REVERSE ANGLE: to reveal, this is all being watched by QUEEN
      KATHERINE, from a palace window above..

      QUEEN KATHERINE turns, and coldly lets the curtain drop..


      EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

      MARY and her entourage travel through the countryside in a small
      caravan of horses and wagons. It's raining heavily.

      The rain continues. MARY's carriage approaches the manor house.
      At one time this was everything she wanted. Now it's a prison.


      INT. MANOR HOUSE - NIGHT
104                                                              104
      MARY sits at the dinner table with her husband, WILLIAM CAREY,
      who's health has deteriorated. He drinks heavily. A shadow of
      his former self.

      He stares at the BABY..
                           W
                          WILLIAM

                            WILLIAM
             I see.

      A painful smile..

                          WILLIAM
             And is he to take my name? Or is he to
             be a Fitzroy or some other sign that he
             is a royal bast...

                          MARY
             He is to be Henry Carey.

                            WILLIAM
             I see.

      A silence, then..

                          WILLIAM
             Well, then, here we are.

      WILLIAM stares at MARY. Clearly still in love with her.

                          WILLIAM
             I could pretend none of this ever
             happened. Start again.
                    (a beat)
             If you could.

      MARY's face. Manages a brave smile.

      MARY lies in bed, her eyes open and staring blankly at the moon
      outside, as WILLIAM CAREY makes love to her.

      After a short, frenzied thrashing..he climaxes, then as before,
      rolls over and falls asleep.

      MARY stares at the ceiling.

      HENRY and ANNE walk through the gardens. Out of earshot of the
      entire court which is assembled outside..

                          HENRY
             Well, I have done what you asked. Will
             you give yourself to me, now?

                             ANNE
             As what?

             above all others?

                          ANNE
             But it's not true. You are loyal to the
             QUEEN above all others.

                          HENRY
             My wife? I barely see her.

                          ANNE
             But she sits on a throne beside you.
             Accompanies you to every state function.

                           ENRY
             For appearance sakes only. In every
             other regard, our marriage is a sham.

                          ANNE
             Still, she is your WIFE. And ever
             present. And I feel her eyes on me. And
             those of her spies.

      ANNE nervously looks left and right..

                          ANNE
             And look at us. Forever reduced to
             meeting in secret like this. Speaking in

      ANNE watches from a distance as HENRY talks to WOLSEY. We do not
      hear their dialogue, but the two MEN are having a heated
      discussion. Voices are raised.

      WOLSEY pleads with the KING to be reasonable. HENRY silences him
      angrily, then walks out..

      ANNE enters a lavish drawing-room, and sits down. She picks up a
      book, and pretends to be reading. HENRY enters, sidles up behind
      ANNE, putting his arms around her, then..

                          HENRY
             Wolsey has agreed to draw up plans for
             the Queen to be sent to a nunnery.

      HENRY kisses ANNE on the neck..

             She will protest, of course. She won't
             go quietly, but she knows she has failed

             So, is this assurance enough? Will you

             Annul it?

                          ANNE
             That woman married two brothers and
             therefore sinned against God.

                          HENRY
             But she never consummated the marriage
             with my brother.

                          ANNE
             They were married six months.

                          HENRY
             Arthur was a sick man.

                          ANNE
             And Katherine is a shrewd woman who knew
             that her position as Queen would never
             be safe until she bedded your brother.
                    (a beat)
             Talk to your advisers. They will tell
             you as much.

      ANNE walks out. HENRY stares.

      ANNE sits in her study working. HENRY appears in the doorway.
      His face is dark. Conflicted.

                          HENRY
             Wolsey has agreed to charge the Queen?

                          ANNE
             But that's wonderful.

      ANNE's smiles, then notices..

                          ANNE
             Why do you look sad?

                          HENRY
             Because she will contest it. Which means
             putting her on trial. And hearing these
             delicate matters in public.

                          ANNE
              es. But any court made up of YOUR
             Bishops will surely find in YOUR favour.
             And declare the marriage invalid.

      Now it's ANNE's turn to start kissing HENRY round the neck..

                          ANNE
              hen you, my sweet Lord, will be free to
             remarry.
                    (sensing his arousal)
             Then I can give myself to you fully.
                     kissing him lower, lower..)
             And give you everything you..
                    (a beat)

      It's mid-winter. A lone RIDER appears on the snowy crest of the
      hill looking down on Rochford Hall.

       t's WILLIAM STAFFORD, (now bearded). He kicks his horse. Rides
      down towards the house.

      A fire roars. STAFFORD warms himself, staring at MARY's new baby
      daughter, (CATHERINE), in a a cot.

                           TAFFORD
             She's beautiful.

                          MARY
             Thank you.

                          STAFFORD
             I brought gifts from your family. A
             night-dress from your mother.
                    (to YOUNG HENRY)
             This from your Uncle George.

      STAFFORD produces a small wooded sword from behind his back.
      Little HENRY takes the sword. Swooshes it with excitement.

                          MARY
             Please be sure to thank them - though
             one wonders what's kept them so busy
             that not a single one of them found time
             to visit the new baby.

                          STAFFORD
             It's Anne. She's turning this country on
             its head. She has persuaded the king to
             test the validity of his marriage, and
             put the QueenM on trial.

                            MARY
             What?

                          STAFFORD
             She continues to hold out. Expertly
             witholding her favours until...

                          MARY
             ..until what?

                          STAFFORD
             Until he makes her the ultimate offer.

      MARY's eyes widen..

                          MARY
             High stakes indeed.

      MARY follows STAFFORD out to the stables where freshly watered
      and fed horses are waiting..

                          MARY
             And my brother George?

                           TAFFORD
             Continues to be promoted. As does your
             Father. I lost track of their latest
             titles.

      STAFFORD smiles. Mounts his horse..

                          STAFFORD
              ow is your husband? I heard he was
             unwell.

                            MARY
             He is.

                            STAFFORD
             I'm sorry.

      STAFFORD stares at her. Their eyes meet. STAFFORD opens his
      mouth, for a moment it looks as if he's about to finally declare
      his feelings, then..

                            WILLIAM (O.S.)
             Mary..!

      WILLIAM CAREY's voice calls out from inside. STAFFORD's
      expression changes. Now's not the right time.

      He kicks his horse, and rides off.


114                                                              114

      WILLIAM CAREY lying in bed, emaciated, coughing blood, weak and
      sick, calls out for help, `Mary!'


115                                                              115
      INT. ROCHFORD HALL - CORRIDOR - DAY

      MARY walks down a corridor towards her husband's bedroom. As she
      goes, she passes a window. She stops. And looks out.

      In the distance is WILLIAM STAFFORD's horse. Reaching the brow
      of a hill..


      EXT. HILL - COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
116                                                              116
      At that precise moment, WILLIAM STAFFORD's horse reaches the top
      of the hill..

                            STAFFORD
                      (pulling horse up)
             Whoa..

      STAFFORD turns, and faces back down at the house. He takes a
      last look. For a moment there is a connection between them both.

       hen, he turns, and kicks his horse, and rides over the brow.

      MARY watches him go, then stops - catches herself feeling
      something for the first time. Then she turns and walks along the
      corridor..

      ..back in the direction of WILLIAM CAREY's coughing.

      A hall filled with LAWYERS and AMBASSADORS from both sides.
      Arguably the grandest, most significant divorce proceedings in
      history.

      ANNE watches from a distance as HENRY talks to CARDINAL WOLSEY.
      Then HENRY turns. He walks towards ANNE.

                          HENRY
             The Queen has insisted a Papal
             representative be present at the trial.
             But Wolsey has assured me the trial will
             proceed for appearance sake only. We
             have our verdict.

                          ANNE
             Then what troubles you?

                          HENRY
             One or two friends have refused to lend
             their support. Among them, Thomas More.
                    (a beat)
             And then there's the small matter of my
             conscience.

                          ANNE
             Why? You have justice on your side.

      HENRY stares, conflicted..

                          HENRY
             Do I?

      ANNE strokes his head. Pacifying him. But the look on her face
      tells us - this is getting harder and harder.

      HENRY sits at breakfast. Reading official correspondence. Legal
      documents. And private letters.

       e sorts through the various scrolls, matters of state, then
      finds one. A letter in a hand he does not recognise.

      A quizzical look. HENRY cracks the seal and begins to reads the
      letter. Presently, his expression changes.

      Then his face darkens ominously. His knuckles whiten..

      ANNE is in the bath. She covers herself..

             `Mary Talbot'.

             Who?

                           SIR THOMAS
             Mary Talbot!! The girl that married
             Henry Percy. It seems she has petitioned
             the King, demanding a divorce from her
             husband( on the grounds..
                     he can hardly bring himself
                     to say the words)
             ...that his prior betrothal to you was
             actually..
                    (his knuckles whiten)
             ..consummated.

      ANNE's eyes widen in horror..`What?'

                          SIR THOMAS
             I knew this would come back to haunt us!

                          ANNE
             I must go to the King.

                          SIR THOMAS
             No! He doesn't want to see you! Or hear
             a word from your lips! He's far too
             angry.

      A cemetery in mid-winter. WILLIAM CAREY's coffin is lowered into
      the ground. MARY, dressed in window's black, steps forward, take
      a shovel, throws earth on the grave.

      MARY walks back to comfort the CHILDREN. The elderly PRIEST
      continues with the service.

      MARY bows her head. Then she senses someone's eyes are on her.
      She looks up, and her expression changes..

      There is GEORGE. Her brother. Standing among the handful of
      mourners. Staring at her.

      The entire BOLEYN family is assembled. SIR THOMAS, LADY
      ELIZABETH, the DUKE of NORFOLK, GEORGE and, at the centre of
      proceedings, ANNE herself.

      The atmosphere is tense. Presently, the door opens, and MARY
      enters the room. In widow's weeds. All eyes on her. And her
      CHILDREN. A sharp intake of breath, a ripple of shock at the
      state of them. In simple country clothes. MARY curtseys..

                            SIR THOMAS
             Mary.

       n awkward silence. MARY holds her CHILDREN's hands..

      Several MAIDS are assembled, fussing over MARY. Transforming her
      from penniless country widow to sophisticated courtier again.

      ANNE enters, (unseen by MARY), and ushers everyone out. She
      takes the brush from the departing SERVANT, and continues to
      brush MARY's hair.

      The KING sits in his private apartment. He looks up as MARY

      enthusiastically greets her. Lapping at her.

      MARY looks at the KING. She is overcome with emotion, but finds
      the strength to hide it..

      MARY walks closer.

                          HENRY
             Closer..
                    (beckons)
             Into the light.

      MARY walks closer. HENRY looks at her..

                          HENRY
             The Other Boleyn Girl. I'd forgotten how
             beautiful you were.

      MARY looks at him. Something has changed in him. A perceptible
      darkness around the eyes. A sadness..

                          MARY
              ou asked to see me, your Grace?

      The BOLEYN FAMILY members are pacing outside. Anxious. ANNE and
      SIR THOMAS exchange looks.

      FINALLY: the door opens.

      MARY emerges from the King's apartments.

       er entire FAMILY stares expectantly at her. ANNE steps forward,
      barely able to conceal her anxiety..

      MARY is putting the children to bed, tucking YOUNG HENRY in.

                           OUNG HENRY
             Mama? What's the matter?

      MARY's face: visibly upset. Her hands shaking.

                          MARY
                    (putting brave face on)
             Nothing.

      MARY smiles, tenderly kisses YOUNG HENRY.

      ANNE appears in the doorway. Watches through a half-open door.
      Notes how loving MARY is as a mother..

      MARY gets to her feet. Walks towards ANNE.

      MARY closes the door behind her. ANNE stares at her, then..

                          ANNE
                    (with difficulty)
             I am forever in your debt.

                          MARY
             You owe me nothing, sister. I did it
             that we may finally draw a line beneath
             everything that has happened between us.

                          ANNE
              hen let it be exactly that. A new start
             between us. Here at court.

      ANNE embraces MARY, who stiffens.

                          MARY
             Thank you. But I'd rather go back to our
             home in the country.

                          ANNE

             Why don't you let your family look after
             you? Your children would have the best
             of everything here. They would grow up
             safe and secure.

      MARY stares, horrified. But before she can reply...

      The sound of a commotion, from outside. The sound of trumpets.
      The unmistakable noise of arriving SOLDIERS.

       veryone rushes to a window. Looks down to see a small ARMY.

       t the centre of everything: an grand, old, bearded ARCHBISHOP
      climbs down from an opulent carriage.

                           MARY
              ho's that?

                          SIR THOMAS
             The Papal Legate. Sent by the Pope to
             preside over the Queen's trial.

      MARY looks first at ANNE, then back out as the long procession
      dramatically enters the Palace Gates.

                          MARY
             So, it's true. It's really happening?

      ANNE suddenly looks pale. Vulnerable. Frightened.

                          ANNE
             Yes, it is. Stay with me, please? I need
             my sister by me side.

      A huge crowd is assembled. Despite the intimidating presence of
      the KING's GUARDS, the people shout vigorously in support of
      QUEEN KATHERINE. Crying out her name. The QUEEN arrives.

       ast cheers go up.

      We're in a packed courtroom. The room is filled with the
      country's highest-ranking bishops. To one side: ANNE and MARY
      watch from behind a screen..

MARY hears the CROWD's cheering for the QUEEN. Screams of
support and affection, `Long live Queen Katherine', `Our one
true Queen'. MARY looks anxious..

                    MARY
       The crowds are with her.

       The crowds have no vote.

       And the bishops that do are in Wolsey's
       pocket.

ANNE watches as KATHERINE enters court. The QUEEN sees ANNE, and
starts walking directly towards them..

                    ANNE (cont'd)
       God, she's coming towards us.

QUEEN KATHERINE walks towards the screen, reaches it, then
                     Q
pushes it aside, intimidatingly flanked by her LAWYERS..

                     UEEN KATHERINE
       So..the Boleyn whores. Two former ladies
       of mine. Hiding in shadows.

       What did I do to upset you, that you
       should turn against me like this?

                    ANNE
       You failed to give England an heir.

                    QUEEN KATHERINE
       And that upsets you so?

                    ANNE
       What upsets the King upsets me.

QUEEN KATHERINE straightens. Big mistake.

                    QUEEN KATHERINE
       How dare you!

                    CRIER

       Katherine, Queen of England, come into
       court..!

KATHERINE's LAWYERS try to drag her away from ANNE, but she
wrenches herself free..

                    QUEEN KATHERINE
        ou want me to creep away and become a
       nun? Well, I shall not. You want me to
       lie before God and admit my first

       not.

       daughter's claim as sole rightful heir

       a thousand years, not if you rack me to
       within an inch of my life...
              (beat)
       I am Katherine, Queen of England, the
       King's one true wife, and mother of the
       heir to the throne. Beloved of the
       people, and beloved of a King you have
       bewitched.

KATHERINE turns and enters the packed courtroom. She makes no
reply to the CRIER, instead walks over to where the KING sits,
and falls onto her knees..

MARY looks at ANNE, who is visibly shaking. And tries to compose
herself.

Throughout the courtroom, people exchange looks. Gasp. KATHERINE
is completely disregarding the court, Campeggio and Wolsey, and
appealing directly to her husband..

                    KATHERINE
       My Lord, how have I offended you? For
       twenty years, I have been a true,
       obedient wife. I have loved all those
       whom you loved, and given you children
       though it has pleased God to take them
       away. If there is any just cause that
       you can allege against me, I will
       happily depart to my shame and
       dishonour, but I tell you, as God is my
       witness, there is none.

 ENRY sits in silence, but can barely contain his rage.

                     ATHERINE (cont'd)
       So, I beg you, dear husband, to spare me
       this humiliation. But if you will not,
       and I am to be tried..

                    HENRY
              (defiant)
       You are.

                    KATHERINE
       ..then let it be in a proper court and
       by the only authority I recognise. His
       holiness himself.

An audible gasp from the court. HENRY shoots a look at WOLSEY,
`What?!?' WOLSEY is horrified, `I know nothing of this.'
KATHERINE gets to her feet, and dramatically walks out of the
court, stopping only to pause by a window..

      The cheers from the loyal PEOPLE who are waiting outside ring
      through the court. HENRY looks dark, thunderous. He storms out
      of court. WOLSEY watches, visibly shaken...

                          WOLSEY
             Since it has pleased the Queen to absent
             herself from the court, the trial will
             simply proceed without her.

      A LAWYER gets to his feet. The trial begins..

      The entire BOLEYN FAMILY is assembled. ANNE paces up and down.
      MARY is with her children..

                          ANNE
             Wolsey promised the King his verdict.
             Instead he has humiliated him.

                          SIR THOMAS
             But they are continuing with the trial.
             And the Bishops will still find in the
             King's favour.

                          ANNE
             Yes. But without the Pope's blessing,
             the result will seem hollow.
                     a frustrated gesture)
             If only the King would take matters into
             his own hands.

                           ADY ELIZABETH
             And do what? His only option would be
             to reject the Catholic Church? And his
             faith would never allow it.

                          SIR THOMAS
             Nor his good sense. Breaking with Rome
             would isolate England politically. Leave
             us at the mercy of the Protestants.

                          ANNE
             But the alternative is leaving this
             country without an heir. Failing in his
             duty as a King. And risking civil war.

      ANNE stops thinks..

             A strong, rosy-cheeked boy..

      HENRY, along with THOMAS CROMWELL and several of his LAWYERS are
      walking along a corridor. They turn a corner, then stop.

      HENRY freezes. He's seen something. And the impact of it has
      made him stop in his tracks.

      REVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL:

      In the gardens outside, are ANNE and YOUNG HENRY, playing.

      The KING's face: it's as if all sound goes silent. He stares,
      transfixed, at the boy. He hears nothing except YOUNG HENRY's
      laughter. He sees nothing except YOUNG HENRY's golden locks.

      MARY watches from a distance, her heart cracking as HENRY
      dismisses CROMWELL and the LAWYERS, and goes out to join ANNE
      and YOUNG HENRY.

       t seems to have a profound affect on him..

      boy..

             Who's this?

                           YOUNG HENRY
             Four, Sir.

      REVERSE ANGLE: to see MARY watching helplessly from inside the
      palace. Tears are streaming down her face. LADY ELIZABETH
      appears, and puts her arm round MARY's shoulders in comfort..

      OUTSIDE: in the gardens, YOUNG HENRY and his father continue to
      get to know one another..

                          YOUNG HENRY (cont'd)
             Is that sword real?

                          HENRY
             I think so. Would you like to see it?

      HENRY draws it, and shows the boy, who's eyes widen in
      excitement..

                          HENRY
             Now, `on guard'.

      HENRY and YOUNG HENRY begin to play fight. As they do, our
      CAMERA slowly, slowly pulls back to reveal..

      The scene is being watched by:

      MARY, her nose pressed against a window in the palace, as she
      continues to watch HENRY play with her SON..

             Take your hands off me..

      The GUARDS drag the QUEEN away, her heart-breaking kicking and
      screaming continues. As she disappears..

      We REVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL: this is being watched shadows by the
      KING himself..

      His face: burning with guilt and self-loathing.

      The door flies open. ANNE is reading, alone. She looks up to see
      HENRY, his eyes ablaze..

                          HENRY
             Now you will give yourself to me.

      ANNE looks up..

                          ANNE
             I thought I had made myself clear. Until
             we are married, there is no questi..

                          HENRY
             Silence! Enough of your GAMES!
                    (tearing at her dress)
             I have torn apart this country for you,
             gone against every principle in my
             heart, I've endured the doubts and
             counsel of good men and silenced them
             with the axe...just to be with you..

      HENRY tears her dress. He forces himself on top of her.

                          HENRY
             Now prove to me it was worth the
             sacrifice.

      He pushes her back against a table, slamming her down, and
      enters her roughly. ANNE cries out in pain..

                          ANNE
             Stop, you are hurting me..!

             How was he with you? As a lover?

      A small ceremony. Held in secret. The distant sound of crowds
      protesting. Booing. Jeering. MARY watches from the shadows as
      ARCHBISHOP CRANMER marries HENRY and a visibly pregnant ANNE..

                          ARCHIBISHOP
                    (in LATIN, we see sub-titles)
             Do you, Henry Tudor, take Anne Boleyn as
             your lawful wedded wife..?

      HENRY's face: eyes burning with self-loathing..

                          HENRY
             I do.

      Their voices are almost drowned by the SHOUTS of protest and
      dissent coming from the streets..`Whore', `Witch'.

A party is in progress. ANNE, the bride, is at the centre of
proceedings, visibly pregnant and finally Queen. But it has
brought her no peace. The cacophony from outside visibly
troubles her. MARY stands by her side. Maid of honour.

                    ANNE
       Did you hear? On the way to the church?
       They were calling me a witch.

                    MARY
       All that will die down as soon as they
       get to know you.

                    ANNE
       But what if it doesn't? What if they
       hate me forever?

                    MARY
       They won't. They will see how much the
       King loves you, and follow.

                    ANNE
              (haunted, hollow)
       How much the King loves me?

ANNE shoots an anxious look over at HENRY, who is with CROMWELL,
in the corner, lost in serious conversation..

                    MARY
        ister, I wonder if you've given any
       thought..to the matter of my returning
       to the country. With the children.

ANNE's face: her expression changes. Suddenly fearful.

                    ANNE
       What? No! I need you here more than
       ever. Besides, as the Queen's sister,
       you can't live alone out there like some
       gypsy. We need to make you a proper
       match.

 earing this, the passing WILLIAM STAFFORD freezes..

                    ANNE
       What about the Duke of Suffolk?

ANNE indicates an ugly, fat COURTIER..

                    ANNE
       All the ladies at court are mad for him.
       Or Lord Fardingly.

      MARY is walking back to her apartments, when WILLIAM STAFFORD
      runs after her, appearing in the corridor behind her..

                            STAFFORD
             Wait! Mary..

      STAFFORD catches her up..

                          STAFFORD
             I couldn't help overhearing. And before
             you agree to any of your sister's
             matches, let me just say..

      STAFFORD takes a deep breath. His heart racing..

                          STAFFORD
             ..I have saved money...not a lot...but
             enough. I've my eye on a place in the
             West...Tatton...near where I grew up..

      MARY turns, an incredulous look..

                            MARY
              hat?
                    (surely this is a joke)
             Stafford?

       TAFFORD blurts it out..

                          STAFFORD
             Mary...I love you. There..I've said it.
             From the moment I joined your family..

                            MARY
             Wait..

      MARY looks at him. A lightening flash of recognition. She's
      heard those words before, and puts two and two together..
                           M
                          MARY
             It was you, wasn't it? At the masked
             ball?

                            STAFFORD
             Yes.

                          MARY
             Oh, Stafford..

                          STAFFORD
             Mary..I have watched how your family has
             treated you.

             dying day..

                          MARY
             But it's impossible. You know that. Now
             Anne's Queen, my family would never
             allow it.

                          STAFFORD
             And you would CARE? What THEY think?
             After everything they have done to you?

       TAFFORD stares incredulously. Then goes.

      MARY's face. Lost in thought. STAFFORD's words still ringing in
      her ears. She sits at the foot of ANNE's bed. ANNE sits in bed.
      Heavily pregnant. On the other side is GEORGE.

                          ANNE
             God, I look hideous.

                             EORGE
             Does it hurt?

                          ANNE
             Little nips and stabs.

      MARY isn't listening. She is lost in thought.

                          GEORGE
             Just imagine. It it's a boy. The unholy
             trinity will be mother, uncle and aunt
             to the next King of England.

                          ANNE
             But if it isn't? The King will take that
             as evidence of God's displeasure. And
             will turn further against me. He's
             already become so cold.

      ANNE touches her stomach anxiously..

                          ANNE
             They say you can tell by the shape of
             the stomach. Mary, what do you say? Boy
             or girl?

      ANNE tails off when she sees MARY. Miles away.

                          ANNE
             What's the matter with her?

      MARY looks up, `What?'

                    (flustered)
             In love!

      shocked. Is it that obvious?

      A darkened room. ANNE screams out. She is in the middle of
      giving birth. With a bone-chilling scream, a head appears..

                          MIDWIFE
             And again, one more..

      ANNE pushes again. MARY holds her. ANNE howls in agony. Her
      nails dig into the sheets. A last, primal, blood-curdling roar
      of pain..

                          MIDWIFE
             It's done, your Majesty..!

                            MARY
             Well done...

      PHYSICIANS and MIDWIVES swarm around the baby. ANNE, despite
      having lost a great deal of blood, tries to sit up..

                            ANNE
             And..?

                            MARY
             It's a girl!

      MARY takes the child from the MIDWIFE, holds it for ANNE.

                          MARY
             A beautiful, healthy girl.

      ANNE is overcome by maternal love, but realises what this will
      mean. She stares at the baby. Fear filling her eyes..

      MARY watches from a distance, as SIR THOMAS and NORFOLK tell the
      King. HENRY staggers from the disappointment, as if he had been
      delivered a blow..

                          SIR THOMAS
             She has named her Elizabeth. After your
             mother.

                          HENRY
             Is the child healthy?

                          SIR THOMAS
             Perfectly, Sir.

      HENRY stares, hollow-eyed. Finally..

                           ENRY
             Well, if we can have a healthy daughter,
             we can have a healthy son.

      HENRY turns, and without a word, pushes past everyone, and
      leaves. ANNE is left alone, her heart breaking..

      MARY stares at ANNE. A stab of compassion. Not long ago the same
      thing happened to her. Hoping to console ANNE, MARY hands her
      beautiful new BABY over to her...

      ..ANNE takes the BABY in her arms. Filled with love for
      something that will almost certainly mean her destruction.

      Her shoulders shake with tears.

                                                    FADE TO BLACK:

      below, HENRY is walking with an attractive young LADY..

                          MARY
             Lady Somerset, I believe.

             Countess of Salisbury.

      And goes to tend to the crying BABY ELIZABETH..

      MARY is with her children, reading them a bedside story. From
      next door, the sound of raised voices. The KING and ANNE are
      having a furious row. But MARY is not listening..

                          ANNE (O.S.)
             You can't ignore me like this. I am your

      ANNE and MARY are together. ANNE is combing her hair. Strands of
      it come loose in her hands. Her eyes are hollow with stress. Her
      skin pale and covered in a film of perspiration..

                          ANNE
             I struck him today. What am I doing? I
             am destroying this all on my own..

      ANNE looks left and right. Makes sure no one is within earshot.
      Goes to check outside her door, then returns..

                          ANNE
             I can't sleep at night! And without
             sleep I cannot think!

                          MARY
             Oh, Anne..

                          ANNE
              nd it's getting more and more difficult
             to arouse him. Some nights he cannot do
             it...at all. I have to resort to ever
             more disgusting...then he hates himself
             in the morning...hates me even more for
             what I made him do...

      ANNE eyes stare. She rocks back and forth..

                          ANNE
             It's slipping away, Mary. I can feel it.

      MARY takes ANNE's hand. Envelops it in hers.

      The sound of ugly, loveless sex. Cries of pain. ANNE tries to
      keep the KING aroused. Demeaning, cruel, shaming, loveless sex.
1     HENRY repeatedly strikes her. Hating her. Hating himself.


 51                                                            151
      INT. MARY'S BEDROOM - PALACE - NIGHT

      In the neighbouring room: the ugly sounds of ANNE and HENRY's
      sex come through the walls.

      MARY covers her ears with a pillow, blocking out the noise, and
      escapes to the only safe world she knows. That of her dreams.


152                                                            152
      INT. ANNE'S BEDROOM - DAY

      SIR THOMAS BOLEYN, NORFOLK, GEORGE BOLEYN and MARY are watching
      intently as ANNE is being examined by several PHYSICIANS.

       nbearable tension. Finally a PHYSICIAN straightens, turns to
      face the FAMILY..

                          SIR THOMAS
             And..?

      The PHYSICIAN's face: he nods.

      A magnificent winter party to celebrate ANNE's pregnancy. The
      River Thames is frozen over. It's a lavish spectacle.

      Jousting on ice-skates, bear-baiting with dogs, MUSICIANS, skate-
      dancing, sledges and fire-eaters and Muscovite tumblers.

The KING threads his way through COURTIERS and ENTERTAINERS.
Wherever he goes, people stop their conversations, bow in fear.
Inimidated.

ANNE, visibly pregnant, sits on a throne. Alone. She looks
drawn, frightened, and tired. An unmistakable echo of QUEEN
KATHERINE at the masked ball earlier.

                     EORGE
       And so, it's come to this. Our sister is
       with child, and all England's fate is in
       the balance.

 EORGE indicates ANNE..

                    GEORGE (cont'd)
       If it's a boy, the King will have been
       vindicated in getting rid of his first
       wife, and his authority will be
       unassailable. But if it isn't. Or if,
       God forbid, she miscarries.

 EORGE indicates HENRY, who's face is also drawn, dark,
malevolent, suspicious. Barely recognisable.

                    GEORGE
       The King will have to move swiftly to
       silence his enemies. He will claim
       innocence. That he was corrupted. Anne
       will swiftly be replaced as Queen, by
       someone more `acceptable'.
              (a beat)
       And we Boleyns will never be able to
       show our faces at court again.

                    MARY
       That's no bad thing.

MARY shudders to herself. Holds her children protectively.

                    MARY
       Anyone with any sense would have run
       away from this hell-hole already. As far
       as they could go.

                    GEORGE
        ike the wise William Stafford.

MARY turns...

                    MARY
       What?

                    GEORGE
       You didn't know? Sold up and went. Left
       for the country. Just like that. Gone to
       live in some place called..

             ..Tatton.

                          GEORGE
             Where he grew up, apparently. Did you
             know he came from a better stable than
             all of us? His grandmother was a
             Beaufort, cousin to the King. And he
             never mentioned it.
                    (shrugs)
             Who'd have guessed?

       EORGE shrugs, and skates off with FRANCIS WESTON. We pull back
      to reveal they are being watched by JANE PARKER..

      ..who looks drained. Lonely. Worn out by the humiliation of her
      failed marriage and the agony of unrequited love.

      INT. ANNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

      `HAAARRGGH', ANNE bolts awake in the middle of the night. Her
      face is pale. She is covered in a thin film of perspiration. She
      flinches in pain. Holding her stomach..

      Immediately doors open, and several SERVANTS and LADIES appear.
      But ANNE composes herself.

                          ANNE
             I'm fine, thank you.
                    (visibly paranoid)
             Just a bad dream.

      Reassured, the SERVANTS fill ANNE's glass with water..

                          ANNE
                    (flinches as she speaks)
             But fetch my brother and sister, will
             you?

      The SERVANT bows, and goes. As soon as ANNE is left alone, she
      slowly looks down, and pulls back the bedsheets..
      W
       hen ANNE sees what lies beneath, she howls in horror.

      MARY and GEORGE arrive breathlessly in ANNE's room, to find..

      ANNE is on the floor before the fire, her arms wrapped around as
      if she were hugging herself. On the floor beside her is a
      bloodstained bundle of sheets.

      ANNE looks up through the trailing locks of her hair..

                    ANNE
       I lost it. Almost without pain. And so
       fast it was over in a moment.

MARY looks down at the bundle of sheets..

                    MARY
              (heart cracks)
       Oh, Anne..

MARY hugs ANNE tightly. All animosity now gone..

                    ANNE
        ou have to get rid of it. Bury it. Get
       rid of it somehow. No one must know.

 EORGE rushes to a cupboard, and pulls out a cape. He wraps it
around ANNE. Then he pours wine into a glass. MARY wraps ANNE in
a blanket to warm her. And begins making the bed with fresh
linen..

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

AN HOUR LATER: ANNE is composed. Staring into the fire. MARY and
GEORGE sit on either side of her.

                    ANNE
       It's not the first. Miscarriage.

MARY's heart cracks. Takes ANNE's hand.

                    ANNE
       They will take it as proof that I cannot
       bear children. That I am cursed by God.
       And should be dispensed with.

                    MARY
       Why? There's still time. You could sleep
       with the King, and fall pregnant again.
       No one would know..

                    ANNE
        he King would never lie with me now,
       and risk damaging the `child' he
       believes I'm carrying..
               a beat)
       Besides, he is barely capable anymore.
       And I couldn't go through that again.

ANNE stares at MARY and GEORGE..

                    ANNE
       No, if I am to survive..I have to take
       matters into my own hands.

MARY and GEORGE exchange blank looks..

       Must I spell it out?

                    MARY
       You mean lying with another man?

                      ANNE
       Of course.

                    GEORGE
       But that would be treason.

                    MARY
        esides, where would you find someone
       you could trust?

                    ANNE
       Obviously, it would have to be someone
       close. Very close..

ANNE stares meaningfully at her BROTHER..

       No..!

       Stop it, Anne! It's madness..

                    ANNE
       Don't you see? This affects all of us.
       If I go down, so do all of you. The only
       way to save ourselves..is to do this..
              (a beat)
       And pray it's a boy.

MARY covers her mouth in horror, gets to her feet..

                    MARY
       I can't listen to this..
              (feeling nauseous)
       ...this is monstrous..

                    ANNE
       Mary, sit down..

                    MARY
       No, Anne! I understand you have had a
       shock tonight. A terrible shock. But
       there is no need for this..

      INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE ANNE'S ROOM - NIGHT

      MARY leaves the room. Tears stream down her cheeks. She runs
      down the corridor, rushing towards her children..

      But as MARY goes, we REVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL:

      A figure sits in the shadows by ANNE's door. Someone who has
      heard everything that has been said..

      ears, unable to listen to any more..

      MARY rushes into her room. She goes to the beds where her
      CHILDREN are sleeping. MARY gently shakes them awake..

      ANNE and GEORGE stare at one another. ANNE pours a mug full of
      mulled wine..

      ANNE takes the first step, and starts unbuttoning her brother's
      shirt. GEORGE quickly knocks back the glass of mulled wine..

      Inside: it's warm, inviting, idyllic. The CHILDREN go to the
      kitchen table. Instantly feeling at home. MARY calls out..

                            MARY
             William?

       o answer.

                           OUNG HENRY
             Mama, I'm hungry.

                            CATHERINE
             Me, too.

      MARY stares. What should she do?

      MARY puts CATHERINE to sleep in a bed. YOUNG HENRY is already
      fast asleep in another bed. MARY draws the curtains.

       hen closes the door.

      MARY walks along a corridor. She looks in the bedroom.

      MEN's clothes in the wardrobe. No sign anywhere of a woman's
      presence. MARY turns, then catches sight of herself in a mirror.
      Her hair is bedraggled. Her clothes are filthy.

      MARY pours hot water into a bath. The room is thick with steam.
      She begins unbuttoning her dress.

      WILLIAM STAFFORD and several FARM-HANDS return from working in
      the fields. Talking and laughing. They reach a crossroads, go
      their separate ways. STAFFORD rides on for a while..

      ..then stops when he sees a horse outside his house.

      STAFFORD dismounts his horse. A quizzical look. Then he walks
      towards the front door.

      STAFFORD enters his house to see empty bowls of food on the
      table.

       HILDREN's boots by the door. And a WOMAN's riding cape.

       rom upstairs, the sound of splashing. STAFFORD expression
      changes. He slowly goes up the stairs.

       he sound of splashing gets louder. A WOMAN's voice. Humming.

      STAFFORD pushes open the door. MARY is in the bath. Washing
      herself. MARY looks up.

      MARY's eyes.

                     a beat)
             I just didn't know where else to go.

      STAFFORD walks in. MARY gets up...

      No modesty. No shame. No effort to cover herself.

      STAFFORD sweeps her into his arms..

      No words. No explanations. Time for that later.

       hey fall into a passionate embrace, and sink to the floor..

      Time has passed. Winter has become spring. We're in an idyllic
      country church. MARY and WILLIAM STAFFORD are being married by a
      PRIEST.

                           RIEST
             Do you, Mary, take William as your

      A dance is in progress. MUSICIANS play. Fifty or so GUESTS.

      MARY is talking to a friend. In another corner: she notices a
      MESSENGER arrive. A former COLLEAGUE from court.

       e talks to STAFFORD. They talk gravely. STAFFORD's face is
      ashen..

      MARY excuses herself from her friend, crosses the room, goes to
      STAFFORD..           M
                           MARY
             What is it?

      ANNE is walking alone. Her MAIDS follow at a distance. Presently
      she lets out a cry. Her body doubles up in pain.

      Her MAIDS rush towards her.

      Back at the dance. STAFFORD continues..

                          STAFFORD
             They say it was deformed...monstrous.
             She is charged with incest and of
             summoning the devil. Your brother, too.
             He has already been sentenced. Anne is
             in the Tower, awaiting trial.

      ANNE in a prison cell at the Tower. Frightened. Vulnerable.

                             MARY
             I must go.

      MARY turns to walk out. STAFFORD blocks her path..

                          STAFFORD
             And do what? George is doomed. For Anne
             it's only a matter of time.

                          MARY
             I can petition the King..

                          STAFFORD
              ou think he will listen? It's his own
             neck he's saving by getting rid of them,
             can't you see?

                          STAFFORD
             Fine, go. But if you do, you might as
             well kiss your children goodbye. You are
             Anne's sister. That alone makes you her
             accomplice and co-conspirator.

                          MARY
             I have no choice. Anne and George are my
             family. I cannot desert them.

      MARY walks towards the door..

                          STAFFORD
             And what of your new family? Your
             CHILDREN?

      ANNE is led into a great courtroom lit by flickering torches,
      and filled with fifty or sixty of the country's most powerful
      NOBLEMEN. ANNE walks to the centre of the room, surveying her
      `jurors', noting that they have remained seated..

                          ANNE
             It is a sad day for England when the
             nobles do not rise for their Queen.

                          NORFOLK
             And even sadder when that same Queen is
             charged with adultery and incest.

                          ANNE
             Charged is different to convicted,
             Uncle. Or is it not? In this court?

      Deathly silence. The clearing of throats. Then with much chair
      scraping, the NOBLES reluctantly get to their feet..

                          NORFOLK
             Master Cromwell, read out the
             indictment..

      CROMWELL gets to his feet..

                          CROMWELL
             The charge is that in the twenty-eighth
             year of the reign of our Sovereign
             Henry, King of England, his wife, the
             Queen, being seduced by the Devil, did
             knowingly commit adultery, high treason
             and offences against God.

                          NORFOLK
             How do you plead?

                          ANNE
             Not guilty, my Lord.

      horse. No thought of rest.

                           A
      ANNE faces the LORDS, as she makes her case..

                          ANNE
             My noble Lords..the love I have for my
             brother is the love any sister would
             have for someone with whom she has grown
             up in the same house, nursed when sick,
             played games as children, shared life's
             celebrations.

      As ANNE delivers this speech, our CAMERA slowly pulls back,
      back, towards the door..

                          ANNE
             That is the love I have for him. Not
             what you suggest.

      Our CAMERA pulls out through the door...

      ..and into a corridor beyond, where we find HENRY hunched in
      shadows, eavesdropping, his face cast in shadows..

                          ANNE (V/O)
             Judge me, my Lords, as you see fit. But
             never forget that your verdicts will be
             judged again by God, in the greatest
             court of all..

      HENRY's face is a study of guilt. His knuckles whiten, his nails
      dig into his hands..

                          NORFOLK (V/O)
             My Lords, the time has come to cast your
             vote.

      ANNE watches on as each LORD takes it in turn to get to his
      feet, and deliver his verdict. First CROMWELL, then the
      SEYMOURS, then HENRY PERCY..

      The verdicts rain down on ANNE, `Guilty, guilty, guilty', going
      round the courtroom, until they reach the DUKE of NORFOLK. ANNE
      meets the eyes of her UNCLE..

                          NORFOLK
                    (unflinching)
             Guilty.

      NORFOLK stares at ANNE. Not a hint of compassion..

                          NORFOLK
             In which case, the burden falls on me to
             pass sentence.

      GEORGE BOLEYN's eyes are covered with a cloth. He puts his head
      on the block. A PRIEST says last rites as GEORGE's arms are held
      back. Terrified, his lips mouth prayers..begging forgiveness.

      The axe falls. A huge ROAR goes up.

      REVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL: this has been watched by SIR THOMAS
      BOLEYN.

      MARY arrives in time to hear the ROAR from the crowds. She
      dismounts her horse, exhausted from the journey,

       he walks against a tide of CROWDS leaving. Drunk. Laughing.
      Talking among themselves.

      MARY's expression changes.

      Suddenly, a shiver goes down her spine. MARY feels sick. Fearing
      the worst, she goes up to a WOMAN in the CROWDS..

      HENRY walks through corridors arm in arm with JANE SEYMOUR,
      followed closely by the SEYMOUR BROTHERS, SIR JOHN SEYMOUR and
      the ever-surviving DUKE of NORFOLK..

      HENRY turns a corner, then stops in his tracks when he
      sees...MARY waiting outside his Privy Chamber, restrained by
      GUARDS. Seeing the King, she curtseys deeply..

                           HENRY
             Mary..?

      The SEYMOUR BROTHERS draw their swords, but the KING's DOG runs
      excitedly towards her. HENRY gestures for the SEYMOURS to sheath
      their swords..       H
                            ENRY
             Leave us.

      The SEYMOURS leave. The DUKE of NORFOLK hesitates..

             ALL of you!

      NORFOLK shoots MARY a look, then goes. HENRY turns and leads her
      into..


      INT. PRIVY CHAMBER - DAY
194                                                            194
      His private room. His sanctuary. Where he took her before. The
      room to which only MARY seems to have had access..

                          MARY
             Your Majesty..
                    (falling into a deep curtsey
                     as HENRY closes the door
                     ensuring their privacy)
             I understand my family has offended you.
             But having taken my brother today, I beg
             you to spare my sister.

                           HENRY
             Oh, Mary...

                                                       110.


                    MARY
       I realise you must replace Anne as
       Queen.
              (a beat)
       But must she die, too?

                    HENRY
       She has been tried and found guilty.

                    MARY
       You could send her away.

                     ENRY
       I am bound by the law.

                    MARY
       You could send her to a nunnery. No one
       would know.

                    HENRY
       Anne? To a nunnery?

HENRY almost manages a smile.

                    MARY
       There is precedent, my Lord. Louis of
       France did it, too. When his wife could
       not conceive.

                    HENRY
       The French Queen was a blameless woman.
       Your sister a witch.

                    MARY
       I understand Anne has offended you. I
       ask only that if there is any regret you
       might..feel yourself.

                     ENRY
       What?

                    MARY
       For your part in the matter..

MARY treads delicately. Realising the very suggestion is
treason.

                    MARY
       ..does not unduly colour your thinking.
       Killing Anne will not make it go away.
              (a beat)
       It would only make it worse.

 ENRY stares at MARY..

                    HENRY
       How could I have made that mistake?

                                                  (CONTINUED)

      Suddenly his eyes are full of regret. And sadness.

                          HENRY (cont'd)
             Choosing her over you?

       ENRY thinks. A long silence.

                          HENRY
              o. I will reflect on the matter.

      MARY falls on one knee. Kisses his swollen, bejewelled hand in
      gratitude. HENRY stares, watching her as she goes.

      A team of CARPENTERS erect gallows and scaffolding. Hammers
      knock nails. A sickening metronome of death.

      OTack', `tack', `tack'.
       n the hill: a blood-stained chopping block is put into place.

      The doors to ANNE's cell open. ANNE looks up. In the doorway is
      MARY. MARY stares at ANNE..

      ANNE's appearance is shocking. She looks ten years older.
      Haggard and lined by stress.

      ANNE puts on a brave face, stares back at MARY.

                          MARY
             Oh, Anne..

      The two sisters walk towards one another, and embrace. Tight.
      Tears run onto each other's shoulders..

                          ANNE
             How has it come to this?

                          MARY
             Ssshhhhh.

      A LIEUTENANT gives a nod. SOLDIERS raise a barrier, and allow
      the CROWDS that have been waiting to rush forward.

       he CROWDS swarm over the grassy hill...putting down
      coats...reserving seats..anxious to secure the best views.

                                                             112.

      ANNE looks out through a narrow window. Her intense, fearful
      eyes flit and dart..

                          ANNE
             They're letting the crowds in.

                          MARY
             It's all right. You will be spared. The
             King as good as gave me his word.

                          ANNE
             The King saw you?

                             MARY
             Yes.

      ANNE manages a rueful smile..

                          ANNE
             We all made a mess of that, didn't we?
             We all underestimated little Mary.

      ANNE looks at MARY..

                          ANNE
             I don't think he ever stopped loving
             you.

                          MARY
             That's not true.

                          ANNE
             It is. He never loved me in the same
             way. And deep down you know it.

      MARY averts her eyes..

                          ANNE
             You should have been Queen. You even
             gave him a son. But instead all this has
             happened because..
                    (a beat)
             Because I couldn't bear to be the Other
             Boleyn Girl.

      ANNE shrugs..

                          ANNE
             And now look?

      The sound of approaching footsteps. ANNE looks at MARY, suddenly
      frightened..

                          ANNE
             Hold me..

      The two SISTERS fall into an emotional embrace as the JAILOR's
      keys turn in the lock..

                          ANNE
             You'll look after Elizabeth?

                          MARY
             It will be all right. Trust me.

                          ANNE
              he couldn't ask for a better moth...
                    (breaks down, composes
                     herself)

      MARY hugs ANNE tight..`Sssshhh'.

                          MARY
              e will spare you. I am sure of it.

      ANNE takes a deep breath. Tries to look serene..

      A roar of the crowd. ANNE, wearing a shawl of white ermine, is
      violently jostled and spat at as she's marched across Tower Hill
      to the scaffold. She shoots MARY an anxious look across the
      crowds..
      M
      MARY shoots a signal, "Don't worry." ANNE climbs the steps, and
      faces the CROWDS. Finally the jeers subside..

                          ANNE
             I...I come here to die...a loyal
             subject..

      More spit, jeers and abuse. MARY stands on tiptoe, cranes her
      neck. Anxiously scans the CROWDS for the GUARDS that will free
      ANNE..

                          MARY
             Come on..

                          ANNE
             ..I..I do not blame the King. Never was
             there a more just or goodly Lord..

      Presently, MARY sees two SOLDIERS pushing through the CROWDS
      towards her. Her heart leaps..

                          ANNE
             ..I beg God's forgiveness and his
             mercy..

      ANNE looks up to see the SOLDIERS reaching MARY, and handing her
      a letter. ANNE smiles in relief. MARY opens the letter and
      reads..

                          CROMWELL (V.O.)
             "Madam..."

      THOMAS CROMWELL, the former assistant to WOLSEY, who has now
      replaced him, sits at his desk, writing the letter..

                          CROMWELL (V.O.)
             ..the King has spared you because of his
             respect and affection for you and
             because you are the mother of his son."

      MARY continues to read the letter, as ANNE is forced to kneel by
      the EXECUTIONER..

                          CROMWELL (V.O.)
             "But you risked your life coming to
             court and you are advised you not to do
             so again. You will not be shown the same
             clemency a second time. Your sister Anne
             was tried and found guilty, her crimes
             were high treason and she deserves to
             die. Cromwell."

      MARY, who is reading, looks up in horror..

                          MARY
             No!

      ANNE looks up. She sees the look on MARY's face.

      MARY's eyes.

      ANNE's eyes.

      `WHOOSH', the masked EXECUTIONER swings his sword. ANNE is
      beheaded. MARY almost chokes..

      The CROWD falls eerily silent. A stunned calm descends on Tower
      Green. Nothing but the sound of the wind.

      MARY sways, then falls backwards, having lost consciousness. She
      falls, falls..but is caught by a strong pair of arms..

      ..WILLIAM STAFFORD, who has followed her to London.

      Suddenly the CROWDS burst into life. A great, bloodthirsty ROAR
      echoes around Tower Green as ANNE's head is lifted aloft..

      WILLIAM STAFFORD carries MARY in his arms. They walk against the
      flow, of teaming CROWDS, and newly-arriving FAMILIES coming to
      watch the spectacle..

       s in the opening scene: three CHILDREN, a BOY and two GIRLS,

      taller than the corn, heads skimming along the sheaves..

      CAPTION #3: "SHE AND WILLIAM STAFFORD LIVED HAPPILY AWAY FROM
      COURT FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES."

      REVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL: the children are being watched from a
