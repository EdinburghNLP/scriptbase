A company that produces a toxic chemical tries to improve its image via a popular spokesperson, Ricky Coogan.
Ricky travels to South America to get a first-hand look at the chemical's effects and finds himself at a mutant freak farm.
Elijah, who runs the farm, is only too happy to have new subjects on which to try his freak machine.
The very chemical that Ricky is supposed to promote is the one responsible for creating the great variety of freaks.
