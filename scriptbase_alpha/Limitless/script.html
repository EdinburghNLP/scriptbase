<b>          INT. A BLACK SCREEN
</b>                         
<b>           EDDIE (V.0.)
</b>           They found me.
                         
<b>          INT. CLOSE 0N - A HIGH-TECH RESIDENTIAL STEEL DOOR
</b>                         
          being POUNDED in. WHAM! WHAM! Whoever's trying to get in is
          serious. The door shudders but doesn't give. It's state-of-
          the-art residential protection.
                         
<b>           EDDIE (V.0.)
</b>           I might have five minutes.
                         
          We hear the WHRRRRR of POWER TOOLS going to work on his door.
          These people are determined. Professional. And prepared.
                         
<b>           EDDIE (V.0.) ( (CONT'D)
</b>           I'll never know how they got past
           security in a half-billion dollar
           building.
                         
<b>          EXT. THE CELESTIAL - LOOKING INTO THE LOBBY - NIGHT
</b>                         
          The sleek lobby is deserted. We SEE, through the GLASS, lying
          on the floor, the barest glimpse of the FEET of what are
          presumably TWO DEAD SECURITY GUARDS -- although their bodies
          are largely hidden behind their massive curly walnut desk.
          All the security monitors are BLACK -- the feeds clearly cut.
                         
<b>           EDDIE (V.O.)
</b>           They've become sophisticated.
           Before they couldn't have done
           this. But now...?
                         
          The CAMERA RISES, breathlessly, in a blur, up all 80 floors
          of this stunning new building, coming to rest on...
                         
<b>          EDDIE MORGAN,
</b>                         
          30's, lean and stylish, standing on the exterior ledge of his
          multimillion-dollar terrace. New York City looms around him,
          beneath him. His hands are outstretched. Balancing. He is
          calm, but fatalistic. He's clearly going to jump.
                         
<b>           EDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>           I will never let them touch me.
                         
          His attention is CAUGHT by the SOUNDS of a commotion in the
          next apartment. He looks over, at-

<b>          THE ADJOINING TERRACE
</b>                         
          Through the gauzy curtains of the window, TWO MEN force A
          MIDDLE-AGED MAN towards the windows... there is arguing.
                         
<b>           EDDIE (V.0.)
</b>           My neighbor must've heard the
           noise. Opened his door to complain.
                         
          Two MUFFLED SHOTS - the neighbor drops. The door is pounded
          again. It doesn't give.
                         
<b>           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
</b>           He bought me half a minute. I wish
           he hadn't. Last thoughts are self-
           pitying and mine are no exception:
           the waste. The waste of it all. I
           mean, how many of us ever know what
           it is to become... the perfect
           version of ourselves. I'd come
           that close. To having an impact on
           the world.
                         
          The pounding intensifies.
                         
<b>           EDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>           And now, the only thing I'd have an
           impact on...
                         
          He looks over the railing...
                         
<b>           EDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>           ... was the sidewalk.
                         
          His smile is bitter, as we CUT TO:

<b>           EDDIE (V.0.)
</b>           Not so long ago, this was me.
                         
          Eddie is walking down the street, messily eating a street
          falafel. His hair is longer, his clothes schlumpier, his face
          rounder --he's out of shape. A belly bulges against his belt.
          He wears jeans and that worn-out corduroy "writer's" sport
          coat --the one that your girlfriend fights to give to the
          Salvation Army.

           came to a non-mutual end, I had, in
           an extraordinary burst of desperate
           energy, bullshitted my way into my

<b>           EDDIE (V.0.)

          QUICK CUTS: --Eddie sprawled on the couch, eating takeout and
          watching TV, the sink in the foreground full of dishes. --
          Eddie shooting baskets into a toy hoop.
                         
<b>           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

          --Eddie sleeping in his bed, sacked out, the clock beside him
          clicking to 11:59 a.m.

           You guys weren't even married six
           months, were you--? I mean, it was
           just a coke thing, right?

          It unexpectedly hurts Eddie. Maybe it's just a bummer day. Or
          there's a deeper wound than he knew.

           they're all going to hold hands,
           light up, and I'll keel over dead.

          Eddie is suddenly seized by a racking cough -- a horrible
          smoker's cough that makes him double over. He sounds like
          he's 80 years old. He finally gets it under control, gets a
          glimpse of himself in the storefront window. He looks bad,
          and he knows he looks bad.
                         
          He reaches into his pocket. THE PILL sits teasingly in the

          dig into his pockets to come up with the change. The VENDOR
          becomes so impatient he won't give him the pretzel, and
          serves another customer first. Eddie looks at HIS CELL

          Eddie sits on the couch with (dead) Vern, staring at him, as
          if a corpse could give up a secret. He looks down at VERN'S

</b>           At least you got your last meal.
                         
          There are lots of takeout containers around.

          Eddie's eye falls on VERN'S STOVE. Unlike the rest of the
          kitchen area, it's pristine. Unspattered. Eddie jumps up.
                         
<b>          VERN'S STOVE - CLOSE
</b>                         
          Eddie opens it. The inside is as clean as the outside. We
          HEAR SIRENS now -- the cops are finally coming, and Eddie
          must rush. Eddie pulls out

          Slowly, Eddie pulls out the package, reaches into it.
                         
<b>          EDDIE'S HANDS - CLOSE

          He is holding about TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS in cash. But
          that's not all. He reaches in again... there's something else
          inside... Eddie's hand pulls out a LITTLE BLACK ADDRESS BOOK.
          But there's still something else.. he reaches in again. And
          now Eddie's hand pulls out A PLASTIC CONTAINER WITH AN AIR-
          LOCK SEAL... he pries the seal off... Inside are FIVE HUNDRED

          Eddie HEARS THE THUD OF APPROACHING FEET, voices. Making a
          decision, he quickly tucks the envelope into his jacket,
          jumps down from the chair... JUST AS A COP pushes through the

          it makes his limp more pronounced. He turns the corner. He

          He shakes Steadman's hand, but Steadman doesn't get up. Odd.
          In fact Steadman looks uncommonly relaxed, almost slouched in
          his chair, looking up at Eddie with a subtle gleam in his eye
          that Eddie doesn't recognize.

          Eddie gestures for him to get in.
                         
<b>                          EDDIE

<b>                          STEADMAN
</b>           All right then...
                         
          He gets in. And Eddie CLOSES THE DOOR AFTER HIM. Stands
          outside the limo, looking back at Steadman through the rolled-
          down window, his face a cold mask.

<b>                          EDDIE
</b>           Don't underestimate your own
           creation.
                         
          Steadman looks at him quizically.
                         
<b>                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
</b>           I mean, you invented it. What does
           it do? It puts me 50 steps ahead
           of you fucks.

</b><b>                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
</b>           You think I didn't spend my days on
           MDT devising a personal defense
           structure that would scare the shit
           out of the Israelis--? You think
           there's not people with a bead on
           you right now, right in this
           building? You think this
           conversation is private?
                         
<b>                          STEADMAN
</b>           You don't know the caliber of
           enemies you'll be making.
                         
<b>                          EDDIE
</b>           You want to push that button? I'll
           show you my silos if you show me
           yours.
                         
<b>                          STEADMAN
</b>           You'll run out. You'll die.
                         
<b>                          EDDIE
</b>           Or I'll think of something. Isn't
           that what MDT does? Makes you
           think of something? Might even
           tell me how to get off it.
                         
          A flicker in Steadman's eyes. Anger.
                         
<b>                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
</b>           What if I just ask the drug... how
           to tell the drug... how to fuck
           itself? I mean, isn't it like the
           8-ball?
                         
          Steadman raises his hand to the driver and the limo pulls
          away.
                         
<b>                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
</b>           It always answers.
                         
          As the limo recedes into the distance, Eddie finally exhales.
                         
          And only then do we see it.
                         
          He's scared.
