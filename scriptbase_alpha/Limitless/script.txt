           EDDIE (V.0.)
           They found me.
                         
          INT. CLOSE 0N - A HIGH-TECH RESIDENTIAL STEEL DOOR
                         
          being POUNDED in. WHAM! WHAM! Whoever's trying to get in is
          serious. The door shudders but doesn't give. It's state-of-
          the-art residential protection.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           I might have five minutes.
                         
          We hear the WHRRRRR of POWER TOOLS going to work on his door.
          These people are determined. Professional. And prepared.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) ( (CONT'D)
           I'll never know how they got past
           security in a half-billion dollar
           building.
                         
          EXT. THE CELESTIAL - LOOKING INTO THE LOBBY - NIGHT
                         
          The sleek lobby is deserted. We SEE, through the GLASS, lying
          on the floor, the barest glimpse of the FEET of what are
          presumably TWO DEAD SECURITY GUARDS -- although their bodies
          are largely hidden behind their massive curly walnut desk.
          All the security monitors are BLACK -- the feeds clearly cut.
                         
           EDDIE (V.O.)
           They've become sophisticated.
           Before they couldn't have done
           this. But now...?
                         
          The CAMERA RISES, breathlessly, in a blur, up all 80 floors
          of this stunning new building, coming to rest on...
                         
          EDDIE MORGAN,
                         
          30's, lean and stylish, standing on the exterior ledge of his
          multimillion-dollar terrace. New York City looms around him,
          beneath him. His hands are outstretched. Balancing. He is
          calm, but fatalistic. He's clearly going to jump.
                         
           EDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           I will never let them touch me.
                         
          His attention is CAUGHT by the SOUNDS of a commotion in the
          next apartment. He looks over, at-
           2.
                         
                         
          THE ADJOINING TERRACE
                         
          Through the gauzy curtains of the window, TWO MEN force A
          MIDDLE-AGED MAN towards the windows... there is arguing.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           My neighbor must've heard the
           noise. Opened his door to complain.
                         
          Two MUFFLED SHOTS - the neighbor drops. The door is pounded
          again. It doesn't give.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           He bought me half a minute. I wish
           he hadn't. Last thoughts are self-
           pitying and mine are no exception:
           the waste. The waste of it all. I
           mean, how many of us ever know what
           it is to become... the perfect
           version of ourselves. I'd come
           that close. To having an impact on
           the world.
                         
          The pounding intensifies.
                         
           EDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           And now, the only thing I'd have an
           impact on...
                         
          He looks over the railing...
                         
           EDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           ... was the sidewalk.
                         
          His smile is bitter, as we CUT TO:
                         
          EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - DAY
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           Not so long ago, this was me.
                         
          Eddie is walking down the street, messily eating a street
          falafel. His hair is longer, his clothes schlumpier, his face
          rounder --he's out of shape. A belly bulges against his belt.
          He wears jeans and that worn-out corduroy "writer's" sport
          coat --the one that your girlfriend fights to give to the
          Salvation Army.

           I was a writer. Two years after my
           copywriting job at Dexter & Kerr
           came to a non-mutual end, I had, in
           an extraordinary burst of desperate
           energy, bullshitted my way into my
           first book contract. This was it:
                         
          INT. EDDIE'S RATTY RENT-CONTROLLED APARTMENT ON AVENUE A- DAY
                         
          Eddie, slumped in his desk chair, is playing COMPUTER
          SCRABBLE.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           Now, at last, I was ready to write.
                         
          QUICK CUTS: --Eddie sprawled on the couch, eating takeout and
          watching TV, the sink in the foreground full of dishes. --
          Eddie shooting baskets into a toy hoop.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           Gearing up, that's all.
                         
          --Eddie sleeping in his bed, sacked out, the clock beside him
          clicking to 11:59 a.m.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           Getting psyched.
                         
          --Eddie sitting on the john, playing a game on his childhood
          Game Boy.
                         
           EDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           A few days did pass this way...
           maybe a few months...
                         
          --Eddie at his desk. He glances at his LAND LINE. The
          message light is unblinkingly green. No one's called.
                         
           EDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Friends fled.
                         
          His POV PANS to the FOOT HIGH STACK OF UNPAID bills next to
          the answering machine.
                         
                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           And banks became attentive. But
           just in case you think nothing ever
           happened to me....

          INT. A MIDTOWN COFFEE SHOP - DAY
                         
          A FEMALE HAND slides a KEY across the counter to EDDIE. Eddie
          stares in disbelief at his (now ex) girlfriend, LINDY, an
          attractive, real-looking girl, late 20's. She's dressed in a
          professional suit. She looks very sad.
                         
                          LINDY
           I don't think I can keep this.
                         
          Eddie is broadsided. Hurt.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Just like that.
                         
          She shoots him a look of almost intolerable sympathy.
                         
                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           I was kind of under the impression
           you cared a little more than just--
                         
                          LINDY
           If I didn't care, maybe I'd be able
           to stand to watch you do this.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Look, I'm going to give 90 pages to
           Mark on Friday. If you could just
           wait, see what he says-
                         
                          LINDY
           Stop. You think I don't know what
           you do all day? I've loved you. I
           know the good stuff, and I know the
           shit.
                         
                          EDDIE
           And it's all shit to you now?
                         
                          LINDY
           You're the one living it.
                          (SYMPATHETICALLY)
           Don't think I don't know it's worse
           for you.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Then you know I could use a friend.
                         
          He tries to push the key back. He cares about her, but he's
          also "working" her sympathy, which she instantly smells.
                         
                          LINDY
           Don't you dare try that shit on me!

          She pierces Eddie with a look. Doesn't take the key.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Well -- what'll work, then?
                         
          They both almost laugh. They know each other so well. But
          she looks away, steeling herself.
                         
                          LINDY
           I see where it's going. You'll
           lose your apartment. And then
           what? You'll move in with me--
                         
                          EDDIE
           Not with that enthusiastic invite--
                         
                          LINDY
           --And then it'll go on this way,
           and I'll rag on you, and finally
           boot you out -- and then what? I
           mean, have you run the film?
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           She knew what was beckoning: the
           lower bunk in my childhood bedroom
           in Newark. We'd even had sex on it
           once. And it was a thing to be
           pitied and avoided.
                         
          Eddie sighs. Drops the glib tone. Looks at her, finally
          mustering the honesty she deserves.
                         
                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           Lindy. I really thought I had it
           in me to do something. --I wasn't
           getting around it, but it was
           fucking there. And now, I, ah...
           don't think it is. There.
           --Anything. At all.
                         
          Lindy looks at him, clear-eyed, seeing him as he is, and
          loving him anyway.
                         
                          LINDY
           You know what...? I'd have had you
           move in anyway... if...
                         
                          EDDIE
           If, what?
                         
          She looks away. Its hard for her to admit this:

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          We are in Eddie's mind, in his POV, and we are seeing a
          LOVELY, WILLOWY BRUNETTE, wearing an undershirt, bending
          seductively over him...
                         
          INT. MIDTOWN COFFEE SHOP - DAY
                         
          From Eddie's eyes we can tell the memory is still fresh. She
          shakes her head, looks away. It's clearly over. She gets up.
          He follows.
                         
                          LINDY
           I have to get back.
                         
                          EDDIE
           --Hey, well -- wait -- you didn't
           tell me what happened yesterday.
                         
          We can see on Lindy's face that she's still vulnerably
          pleased that Eddie remembered to ask.
                         
                          LINDY
           I got it.
                         
                          EDDIE
           You got it--?!
                         
                          LINDY
           Yeah. I'll have my own assistant.
           You believe that?
                         
                          EDDIE
                          (GENUINE)
           You deserve it, Lindy.
                         
                          LINDY
           Yeah, thanks. I do.
                         
          She smiles weakly, breaks eye contact. No good to keep
          looking. It's over. Eddie makes an attempt to reach for the
          check, which Lindy grabs.

          EXT. MIDTOWN STREET - DAY
                         
          Eddie is walking home, eying the homeless on the street,
          feeling his dismal future breathing down his neck.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           She was right. I was almost 35.
           No one talks about "potential" at
           35. I had missed the on-ramp.
           Soon I'd be sleeping in the lower
           bunk of my childhood bedroom... my
           father happy to welcome me into the
           challenging field of dental supply
           inventory...
                         
          He's interrupted by A VOICE - calm, amused:
                         
                          VOICE
           Eddie. Morgan.
                         
          VERNON GANT looks him over with condescending bemusment. He's
          30, wears an expensive suit, looks like he comes from money.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           Of all the useless relationships
           better forgotten and put away in
           mothballs, is there any more
           useless than... the ex-brother-in-
           law?
                         
                          VERNON
           Shit! It's gotta be-- 9 years--?
                         
                          EDDIE
           But who's counting.
                         
                          VERNON
           (taking him in)
           Hey, you!!!
                         
          He genially whacks the sides of Eddie's arms. Eddie
          halfheartedly whacks back. Vernon sizes Eddie up.
                         
                          VERNON (CONT'D)
           Jesus, Eddie, pack it on, why don't
           you?

          Eddie didn't need that. He's very self-conscious about his
          weight.
                         
                          EDDIE

                          VERN
           So you're still trying to write?
                         
                          EDDIE
           As a matter of fact, I've got a
           book contract.
                         
          Vern looks half suspicious, half impressed.
                         
                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           How about you?
                          (POINTEDLY)

          Eddie sizes him up: the suit, shoes, watch, haircut.
                         
                          EDDIE
           No.
                         
                          VERNON
           Come on, let's get a drink. I wanna
           hear about this book.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Nah, I should go--
                         
                          VERN
           You can't tell me you're a health
           nut, now. Not with that tire-

           Enticing invitation. Thanks.
                         
          Vern plucks the pack of cigarettes from Eddie's upper jacket
          pocket.
                         
                          VERN
           C'mon, c'mon, one beer. Or I won't
           give `em back.
                         
          He holds the cigarettes just out of Eddie's reach.

          A BARTENDER brings beers to Eddie and Vernon who sit at the

          Vernon can sense his emotion.
                         
                          VERNON
           Walked out on her, if you really
           want to know. But what do you care?
           You guys weren't even married six
           months, were you--? I mean, it was
           just a coke thing, right?

           Is that what she said--?! "A coke
           thing."
                         
          It unexpectedly hurts Eddie. Maybe it's just a bummer day. Or

           No, this is an exclusive product

           Look, they've identified these
           receptors in the brain that
           activate specific circuits, and--
           you know how they say you can only
           access like 20 percent of your

           possible lumps, rashes, maybe
           they're a condition, or a network
           of conditions. One of these days
           they're all going to hold hands,
           light up, and I'll keel over dead.
           My life's in the crapper, and I

           No, I'm not going to tell him! You
           tell him -- no, now!
                         
          He turns off his phone, gets up.

           Fucking people. I'm afraid I'm
           going to have to leave you here,
           Eddie. But let's hang out again,
           have another beer.
                         
          He takes out his business card, and places it carefully next
          to the little white tablet on the bench.
                         
                          VERN (CONT'D)
           By the way, that's on the house.
                         
                          EDDIE
           I don't want it, Vern.
                         
          Vern smiles at him.
                         
                          VERN
           Don't be ungrateful, now. You know
           how much these things cost?
                         
          Eddie shakes his head.
                         
                          VERN (CONT'D)
           Eight hundred bucks a pop.
                         
          He pats Eddie on the shoulder and goes. Eddie is still
          looking at the pill.
                         
          Which seems to be looking back at him.

          Eddie makes his way home, a little tipsy and filled with self-
          loathing.
                         
           EDDIE (V.O.)
           All the way home she was back on my
           mind ... Melissa.
                         
          FLASH!
                         
          A memory -- Melissa's face as she's talking, laughing.
                         
           EDDIE (V.O.)
           She'd been so smart. Smarter than
           anyone around her. And oh, how she
           loved to provoke people...

          INT. A DOWNTOWN PARTY - PARTY - NIGHT
                         
          Melissa, sparkling, beautiful, surrounded by people, in
          intense conversation with a bunch of downtown types.
                         
                          MELISSA
           --Oh, please, you think
           professional women mentor one
           another? You think there's some
           mutually supportive empathetic
           touch-feely network of kindly pie-
           bakers? --Those bitches hate each
           other! Quick, who was the worst
           boss you ever had? A woman, right?!
           We can't delegate, we can't command
           -- I mean, there's a reason we're
           not generals--!
                         
          The men gasp, shocked and titillated. The women are furious.
          Melissa smiles to herself --she's trying not to crack up.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           I thought, by now, she'd be curing
           cancer, directing movies, running
           for the Senate...
                         
          We HOLD ON MELISSA'S LOVELY, CONFIDENT FACE as her voice
          fades down and Eddie's fades in.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           What had happened? Her life made no
           sense. I mean, I could see a
           direct, plausible link between this
           Eddie, broke and buzzed at three
           o'clock in the afternoon, and an
           earlier Eddie...

          in bed, sleeping, behind him --an oxygen mask on her. She's
          clearly terminal.

          Eddie walks, pensive.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           But there was no link between my
           Melissa and this upstate Melissa
           dumped, cold-calling people from
           her living room.
                         
          EXT. EDDIE'S BUILDING - DUSK
                         
          An edgy neighborhood on the furthest edge of lower Manhattan.
          This block may never be gentrified.
                         
           EDDIE (V.O.)
           40 long blocks later I was "home."
                         
          He digs in his pocket for the keys and comes up with...
                         
          THE LITTLE WHITE PILL
                         
          INT. EDDIE'S BUILDING - STAIRWELL - DUSK
                         
          It's a former tenement, fourth-floor walk-up. Eddie trudges
          up the old stairs, the tiny tiles worn away in spots, the
          Victorian moldings disfigured from a hundred and twenty years
          of paint.
                         
          Eddie is suddenly seized by a racking cough -- a horrible
          smoker's cough that makes him double over. He sounds like
          he's 80 years old. He finally gets it under control, gets a
          glimpse of himself in the storefront window. He looks bad,
          and he knows he looks bad.
                         
          He reaches into his pocket. THE PILL sits teasingly in the
          palm of his hand, looking up at him.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           Well. There was less than nothing
           to lose.
                         
          Quickly, impulsively, he swallows it.

          As Eddie passes, a neighbor's door swings open. Eddie tries
          walking faster.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           I didn't want to see anybody.
                         
          VALERIE, 26 and attractive, emerges, dressed to go out.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           Especially not my landlord's nasty
           young wife.
                         
          She is immediately soured at the sight of Eddie. Eddie knows
          what she's thinking.
                         
                          EDDIE (CONT'D)

           Steve handles the rents. So feed

           EDDIE (V.0.)
           I suddenly had extra reason to get
           away from her. I had thoughtlessly
           ingested a substance.
                         
          Valerie's tirade FADES up or down, depending on when we're
          hearing Eddie.
                         
                          VALERIE

           EDDIE (V.0.)
           I had gotten remarkably little
           information from Vernon about what
           this drug would do.
                         
                          VALERIE

          Eddie continues up the stairs. But she follows, getting in
          front of him.

           ...What if it was a hallucinogen...
           oh my God... listening to her rag,
           if I were tripping...? I'd jump out
           a fucking window.
                         
          VALERIE'S voice fades up.
                         
                          VALERIE
           --Look, I'm just telling you, he's
           been talking about calling these
           people he knows from the club to
           muscle you out -- I've told him not
           to do that, but he's really pissed.
                         
          We PUSH IN on Eddie's face, into his eyes... where we see his
          pupils contract just slightly. A flicker.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           And then... I felt it.
                         
          EDDIE'S POV - THE APARTMENT UPPER HALL...
                         
          The room is changing... springing into sharper focus.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           Levels more, layers more, 3-D
           more... galactically more. But the
           same. Just the depth and beauty...
           of clarity.
                         
          There seems to be more definition, more dimension, a little
          more light -- he can see more clearly. The SOUND drops out
          for a moment; he can see VALERIE'S FACE, mouth contorted,
          continuing to heap the abuse, but there's something in her
          eyes that's not mean... something anxious.He looks at her
          with a sudden keen intelligence. And sympathy.
                         
                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           What's wrong?
                         
          She's taken aback.
                         
                          VALERIE
           W-What?

          He looks down. She's right --only a corner of the book is

                          BACK TO:
                         
          INT. EDDIE'S BUILDING - LANDING - DAY
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           Somehow, my unconscious had served
           that up... a memory I'd never even
           recorded. Or was it there the whole
           time... and all I needed... was the
           access?
                         
          ON EDDIE'S FACE - CLOSE
                         
          As it sinks in:
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           Vern was right. This was no
           recreational drug.
                         
          Eddie's eyes flick to the laptop in her bag, his manner
          suddenly intimate, confident.
                         
                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           If you're writing a paper, that's
           not the book I'd use.
                         
                          VALERIE
           Well, who asked y-
                         
                          EDDIE
           Cal Berkeley has her oral history.
           I'd start there. Her son is still
           alive. You could Google him. Sons
           of famous people always want to
           dish dirt about their parents.
           You'd get something no one else
           has, and you'd've gone the extra
           mile, a nice little apple for the
           professor.
                         
          During this speech, MUSIC COMES UP and the sound goes down...
          SEVERAL QUICK CUTS...

          Eddie and Valerie's mouths are moving... she's asking
          questions... he's supplying answers, lots of them...
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           Information from the odd museum
           show, a half-read article, some PBS
           documentary, was all bubbling up to
           my frontal lobes, mixing itself
           together into a sparkling cocktail
           of useful information.
                         
          Valerie's whole posture is relaxing, the look in her eyes
          becoming... friendly.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           She didn't have a chance.
                         
          INT. THE DOWNSTAIRS APARTMENT FROM EDDIE'S - NIGHT
                         
          A mirror image of Eddie's, but considerably nicer. We HEAR
          the SOUNDS of two people -- Valerie and Eddie -- HAVING WILD,
          mutually satisfying SEX from the other room.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           We'd really worked on her paper,
           too. In 45 minutes it was a
           polished gem. She was pleased.
                         
          We see the laptop set up, books scattered -- then, obviously
          abandoned for a more pleasurable pursuit.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           One nice little side effect...? I
           stayed hard for hours.
                         
          We HEAR female groans of pleasure. Laughter.
                         
          INT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
                         
          A dishevelled Eddie opens the door to his apartment. He
          enters, looks around.
                         
           EDDIE (V.O.)
           Happy and sore, I returned home.
                         
          EDDIE'S POV - HIS LIVING ROOM
                         
          It's the first wide shot we've seen of it, and it hammers
          home: what a mess. Books scattered across the floor, dirty
          dishes, broken Venetian blind sashes. The nest of a slob.

           could it? Who would live like this?
                         
          MONTAGE: Speeded-up shots of Eddie sifting through his books
          and tapes. Cleaning up the kitchen. The bathroom. Picks up
          books. He starts moving the sofa.
                         
          QUICK CUTS: the living room, rapidly whipped into shape. If
          not stylish, habitable. Final shot: he's sitting on the
          (repositioned) couch. Thinking.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           What was this drug? I couldn't stay
           messy on it, I hadn't had a
           cigarette in six hours...
                         
          He stares at the pack in his hands. It looks alien.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           ...hadn't eaten... So. Abstemious
           and tidy. What was this -- a drug
           for people who want to get anal?
                         
          He gets up. Paces.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           I wasn't high, wasn't wired --just
           clear. What I needed to do. And how
           to do it.
                         
          His eye falls on his COMPUTER.
                         
          The MONTAGE CONTINUES: Eddie flipping through research books,
          typing onto his keyboard, the printer printing, doing
          Internet searches... pages and pages spit out of the printer.
                         
          INT. EDDIE'S BEDROOM - MORNING
                         
          Eddie, in his underwear, is sleeping soundly. He stirs, rolls
          over, cracks open an eye.
                         
          He gets up, schlumps to the mirror, looks at his unshaven
          face. The penetrating gleam is no longer in his eyes.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           The next morning, I sent a little
           probe down into my brain. No surge
           of brilliance came up to greet me.
           I felt thick and stupid -- a
           shuffling zombie without my coffee
           and cigarette. In short...

          CLOSE UP -- EDDIE'S UNDERWEAR is tossed at the hamper -
          missing it by about a foot. The underwear remain on the
          floor.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           I was back.
                         
          INT. EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING
                         
          Eddie lies on the couch. (Already the room shows signs of
          being messed up again.) His eye suddenly falls on his desk.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           But something remained.
                         
          INT. EDITOR'S OFFICE - DAY
                         
          Eddie drops A STACK OF FRESH PAGES on the desk of MARK
          SUTTON. Mark looks skeptically at Eddie, then the pages.
                         
                          MARK
           You're kidding.
                         
                          EDDIE
           No.
                         
                          MARK
                          (SARCASTIC)
           Words have appeared on paper.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Yes.
                         
                          MARK SUTTON
           Written by you.
                         
          Eddie knows he's on thin ice.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Three pages. That's all you have to
           read. If you read them in the next
           hour, and you don't want to keep
           reading I'll give back the advance.
                         
          EXT. FLATIRON DISTRICT - DAY
                         
          Eddie standing on the street, the crowd flowing around him.
          He turns this way and that, clearly anxious, impatient. Where
          to go? What to do to kill the time?
           23.
                         
                         
          EXT. STREET - DAY - THREE SHOTS:
                         
          1. Eddie orders a PRETZEL from a food cart. He is having to
          dig into his pockets to come up with the change. The VENDOR
          becomes so impatient he won't give him the pretzel, and
          serves another customer first. Eddie looks at HIS CELL
          PHONE. Makes sure it's on. No call.
                         
          2. Eddie sits on a stoop, slowly nibbling on his pretzel, his
          eye glued to his phone. No call.
                         
          3. Eddie tosses the finished pretzel's wrapper and SHAKES HIS
          PHONE in frustration. A RING! Eddie jumps up, fumbles with
          his phone just as a passing male WALL STREET SHARK pulls out
          his phone and answers. The ring wasn't for Eddie.
                         
          INT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
                         
          Eddie comes in, then notices something's different. His
          ANSWERING MACHINE has a blinking red light. Eddie clicks the
          button, breathless.
                         
           MARK SUTTON'S VOICE
           Eddie... give me a call when you
           get in... (BEEP)
                         
          The second message is from Mark too.
                         
           MARK SUTTON'S VOICE (CONT'D)
           Eddie, I'm 40 pages further in...
           call me... it's a little grandiose,
           but I'm still reading...
                         
          A third message - BEEP!
                         
           MARK SUTTON'S VOICE (CONT'D)
           Okay, how did you do this? I'd, uh,
           I'd really like to -- shit, just
           call me the minute you get in,
           call. Okay? Okay. (BEEP!)
                         
          Eddie jumps up, gleeful-- he knew it! Then his smile fades.
          Reality hits.
                         
           EDDIE (V.O.)
           But how would I finish? It was
           "enhanced" Eddie who displayed all
           that brilliance. Not me.

          Eddie, holding Vern's card, buzzes the buzzer. There's no
          answer. Eddie buzzes again and again. Finally:

           Vern -- last night 90 pages just
           wrote themselves! I totally chucked
           the novel I pitched them --I
           suddenly SAW, Vern, how this whole
           societal economic class struggle --
           and its solution -- didn't have to
           be futuristic or fictional -- it
           was actually ACHIEVABLE here, in
           our lifetime -- and I could just
           lay it out, like, like a manifesto,
           or something, like Mein Kampf
           except not by a crazy racist fuck!
           (no response, realizing)
           Okay, I won't talk any more about
           this if you let me in.
                         
          The buzzer buzzes.
                         
          INT. VERN'S APARTMENT DOOR - DAY
                         
          The door opens. And Eddie is taken aback. Vern has been
          beaten up. Really worked over. His lip is split, his face
          puffy and bruised. His right hand is bandaged.
                         
                          VERN
           Well, that was fast.
                         
                          EDDIE
                          WHAT HAP-
                         
                          VERN
           Don't ask.
                         
          Leaving the door open, Vern turns around and motions at Eddie
          with his left hand to come in. The place is all mismatched
          antique furniture -- the possessions of someone who collected
          once, with enthusiasm, but who's letting it all go to hell.
          Vern sits, keeping his injured arm elevated.
                         
                          VERN (CONT'D)
           So, Eddie. I guess you're
           interested after all.

          And Eddie wants the drug more than he wants to know what
          happened.
                         
                          EDDIE
           What's... um... what's it called?
                         
                          VERN
           It doesn't have a street name yet,
           because it doesn't have a street
           profile. And that's the way we want
           it to stay. The boys in the kitchen
           are calling it MDT-48.
                         
                          EDDIE
           "The boys in the kitchen...?" Vern,
           that doesn't sound FDA approved.
                         
                          VERN
           "FDA-approved," that's a laugh. Did
           you really believe that shit?
                         
          Eddie stares at Vern as he pours himself a coffee.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           Okay, so what did we have here?
           Some unknown, untested, possibly
           dangerous drug scammed out of some
           unidentified lab somewhere, given
           to me by a highly unreliable guy I
           hadn't seen in years.
                         
                          VERN
           So you want some more of it?
                         
                          EDDIE
           Yes. Definitely.
                         
          Vern chuckles. He knew it.

           maybe you can do me a little favor.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Uh... sure.
                         
          Eddie wants to get on with it and get out of there, but Vern
          clearly has him by the balls.
                         
                          VERN
           You can see, I'm in no shape to go
           out right now. Will you hop down to
           the dry cleaners and get my suit?
           And maybe pick me up a little
           breakfast...?
                         
          Eddie sighs. Vern tosses him a set of KEYS.

           me a month's rent.
                         
          He arrives at Vernon's door. He takes out the keys Vern gave
          him, but he doesn't need them. The DOOR is AJAR.

          As Eddie pushes the door open, he can see Vernon sitting,
          quite normally, on the couch. As he enters the room, though,
          he sees that the place has been RANSACKED. Destroyed.
                         
          Eddie wheels back to ask Vern what the fuck. And then sees
          it.
                         
          VERN'S FACE -CLOSE
                         
          In the center of his forehead is a neat little BULLET HOLE.
                         
                         EDDIE
                         
          is no tough guy, and sweat springs to his brow. He starts
          shaking... then, seized with horror that they might still be
          in here, he edges to the bedroom. We hear THE POUNDING OF HIS
          HEART as he peeks in...
                         
          INT. EDDIE'S POV - VERN'S BEDROOM
                         
          It's been ransacked, too. Torn to shreds, bureau drawers
          opened and dumped, pillows ripped open with knives. But no
          one is there.

                          EDDIE
           Yes... I... I need to report a
           murder. Eddie. Morgan. --Edward J.
           I won't.
                         
          He puts down the phone, puts his head in his hands.
                         
          VARIOUS CUTS OF: Eddie sitting. Shifting his butt in various
          positions. Holding a BASEBALL BAT he's found --just in case
          "they" come back.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           It took them forever. And the
           longer I sat there, the clearer I
           saw... Vern had known whoever had
           done this. He'd opened the door.

          Eddie, cleverly wearing kitchen gloves, is now furiously
          tearing through the rubble the thieves have left behind, the
          scattered clothes, under the bed...
                         
          INT. BATHROOM -. DAY
                         
          Eddie pokes quickly through the medicine cabinet -- nothing
          but Tylenol.
                         
          INT. VERN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
                         
          Eddie sits on the couch with (dead) Vern, staring at him, as
          if a corpse could give up a secret. He looks down at VERN'S
          BREAKFAST CONTAINER.
                         
                          EDDIE
           At least you got your last meal.
                         
          There are lots of takeout containers around.
                         
                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           You never did like to cook...
                         
          Eddie's eye falls on VERN'S STOVE. Unlike the rest of the
          kitchen area, it's pristine. Unspattered. Eddie jumps up.
                         
          VERN'S STOVE - CLOSE
                         
          Eddie opens it. The inside is as clean as the outside. We
          HEAR SIRENS now -- the cops are finally coming, and Eddie
          must rush. Eddie pulls out
                         
          THE BROILER - CLOSE
                         
          Taped to the inside is A LARGE BROWN PADDED ENVELOPE.
          Slowly, Eddie pulls out the package, reaches into it.
                         
          EDDIE'S HANDS - CLOSE
                         
          He is holding about TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS in cash. But
          that's not all. He reaches in again... there's something else
          inside... Eddie's hand pulls out a LITTLE BLACK ADDRESS BOOK.
          But there's still something else.. he reaches in again. And
          now Eddie's hand pulls out A PLASTIC CONTAINER WITH AN AIR-
          LOCK SEAL... he pries the seal off... Inside are FIVE HUNDRED
          OF THE LITTLE WHITE PILLS.
                         
          Eddie HEARS THE THUD OF APPROACHING FEET, voices. Making a
          decision, he quickly tucks the envelope into his jacket,
          jumps down from the chair... JUST AS A COP pushes through the
          door.

                          EDDIE
           Okay.
                         
          A beat. Melissa's voice is wan, vulnerable.
                         
                          MELISSA'S VOICE
           Okay.
                         
          She's hung up. Gone. Eddie turns back to the detective who's
          staring intently at him.
                         
                          DETECTIVE
           Something doesn't jell here.
                         
          Eddie tries not to look panicked. The cop looks up, taking in
          the entrance of THREE newly arrested HIGH CLASS HOOKERS.
                         
          They are young. They are blond. They are wearing very short
          skirts and fuck-me heels. The cop eyes them appreciatively.
                         
           EDDIE (V.O.)
           But I knew, when his attention
           wandered to something more
           pressing, that he was going to let
           me go.
                         
          EXT. PRECINCT - DAY
                         
          Eddie walks down the stairs, shaken up but profoundly
          relieved. Even a little giddy. Then he stops.

           Only then did it occur to me that
           someone could have followed me from
           Vern's apartment.
                         
          EXT. THE STREET - DAY
                         
          Eddie walks, trying to cast inconspicuous glances over his
          shoulder.
                         
          EDDIE'S POV - THE STREET
                         
          Is this guy following him? That guy? They all look innocuous.
          They all look threatening. He has no idea.

           Probably not. Hopefully not.
           Worth the risk?
                         
          Eddie enters, and, casting a surreptitious look around,
          closes the door behind him.
                         
          INT. EDDIE'S DINING TABLE - DAY
                         
          The cash, the address book, and the bottle of pills are all
          laid out on the table. Eddie sits, looking at them, realizing
          that his life is now about to be jump-started. Yeah. Worth
          the risk. A smile twitches at the corner of his mouth.

          Eddie is walking down the street, a brisk confidence in his
          step, that penetrating gleam of intelligence back in his
          eyes. We know right away that he's on MDT.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           Back on MDT, it was obvious what I
           should do.

          He sits at his computer, a salad beside him. His printer
          spits out page after page of manuscript.
                         
                          EDDIE

          It contains ten tablets of MDT. Eddie's fingers reach in,
          take one.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           A tablet a day... kept the torpor
           away. And what I could do with my
           day... was limitless.

          phrases.
                         
           EDDIE V.0.
           Even half-listening to any
           language, I became fluent...
                         
          Eddie becomes aware that there's ANOTHER RUNNER --a powerful-
          looking man, gaining on him, closer behind than makes him
          comfortable. Eddie flicks a glance over his shoulder.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           The only cloud was the nagging
           feeling I was being followed.
                         
          With a surge of effort, Eddie speeds up, sprinting across the
          street just after the light changes. WHIZZING TRAFFIC cuts
          the mysterious runner off, stops him from following. He
          remains, panting, at the light.

                          EDDIE

           are unrelated to achievement, that
           the greatest hits CD cannot
           possibly contain good songs? That
           Shakespeare's catchiness belies

           Yeah. It'll all happen again.
                         
          Eddie toasts him.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Hey, I want in on it!
                         
          Kevin Doyle, wishing Eddie was right, clinks his glass.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           My brain was just pouring this
           stuff out. Everything I'd ever
           read, heard, seen, was now
           organized and available --here it
           is, here you go..

          Eddie leaves with several people. Kevin Doyle presses a card
          into Eddie's hand.
                         
                          KEVIN DOYLE
           You must have a portfolio, but if
           you don't, I'd be very interested
           in working with you.

                          EDDIE
           Thank you so much.

           "I must have a portfolio." Very

          INT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
                         
          Eddie pulls out the broiler and removes the ENVELOPE OF CASH
          he's taped in there. It's much thinner.
                         
           EDDIE (V.O.)
           But Vern's cash was low. And it

          Another ELEGANT MAN is there too, Mark's boss, DUNHAM.

                          DUNHAM
           Well... sit down, we'll be
           discussing that.
                         
                          MARK SUTTON
           First, ah... I want to apologize,
           Eddie, if I in any way communicated
           a lack of faith in your abilities.
                         
          Eddie smiles coolly. In control. It's Mark who's a little
          nervous.
                         
           MARK SUTTON (CONT'D)
           Mr. Dunham has read your pages, and
           we're prepared to make you what I
           hope will be a very exciting offer.

                          DUNHAM (CONT'D)
           We think this could be an important
           title, maybe one in a series. I
           have to say, you came out of
           nowhere, but the good ones always

                          MARK SUTTON
           Eddie, we take you very seriously
           as a writer.
                         
          Eddie sounds almost regretful.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Yes, but I now see that writing, as
           a profession, is for marginalized
           whiners not fit for anything else.
                         
          Sutton thinks Eddie's kidding. He laughs nervously.
                         
                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           No, I mean it, look at the life.
           Incarceration, loneliness,
           burrowing down into your own
           psyche, increasingly insulated from
           any truth, because you're not in
           the currents of the world any more,
           you're rattling around inside the
           cage of your brain, self-
           cannibalizing...
                         
          Dunham realizes he's losing Eddie, and jumps in.
                         
                          DUNHAM

          a large paper bag. Eddie reaches for it; Gennady holds it

                          GENNADY
           Okay, you take this... you mine.

           I'd heard the old metaphors about
           the stock market: it was a
           collective nervous system, a global
           brain, a numerical representation
           of the will of God...

          Lindy, Eddie's ex-girlfriend, is sitting across the table
          from Eddie. She peers at him, confused. Is this dapper

           I'm actually... more than proud.
           I'm a little...

          He walks back over to her, looks down. She is snuggled up in

          He puts his hand on a table, steadies himself. He catches a
          look, in the mirror, of this lean, handsome, dapper shark he
          has become.

          There is so much quiet authority in Eddie's tone that Kevin
          just shuts up. But a moment later, looking at the sweat on
          Eddie's brow, Kevin is pecking at him again.

          The martini is put down on the table. We tilt up to CARL VAN
          LOON, a young 50, no less vital and intense than the
          hungriest 27-year-old shark on the make. But he affects

          does the same.
                         
                          VAN LOON
           So. Eddie Morgan.
                         
          He looks Eddie directly in the eyes.
                         
           VAN LOON (CONT'D)
           What's your secret?
                         
          A beat. Eddie looks at him back, directly in the eyes.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Medication. I'm on special
           medication.
                         
          Another beat. And Van Loon laughs. Pierce doesn't.

          ANOTHER ANGLE - LATER - THAT NIGHT
                         
          Eddie is in mid-spiel, Van Loon listening intently.
                         
                          EDDIE
           --Yes, that's partially what I'm

           Pattern recognition? So that's your
           snake-oil? Look, if there's one
           thing we all understand, it's

           Of course, not everyone can
           understand the patterns.
                         
          Kevin sucks in his breath. Pierce is annoyed. Van Loon is
          mildly amused, but not necessarily impressed. Eddie
          continues with his unstoppable, MDT-fueled insights:
                         
                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           Look, there's no time for human
           judgement anymore. You see a
           chance, you blink, and it's gone.
           We entered the age of
           decentralized, online decision-
           making, with the decisions being
           made by hundreds of millions of
           individual investors around the
           world, people who don't even know
           each other -- making a killing in

           Same rules, even in a panic. It's
           not understanding how companies
           work. It's understanding how mass
           psychology works.

           I don't have delusions of grandeur.
                         
          A beat, as we PUSH IN on Eddie's face.
                         
                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           I have an actual recipe for
           grandeur.
                         
          Kevin stares in horror. Van Loon still says nothing.
                         
          EXT. THE ORPHEUS ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Eddie simply stands there coolly; Kevin is nervously saying
          goodbye to Van Loon and Pierce, making small talk.
                         
                          KEVIN

          Kevin blubbers with gratitude. Van Loon's car pulls up. Kevin
          pumps his hand. Van Loon looks past Kevin -- to Eddie.
                         
           VAN LOON (CONT'D)
           Eddie. Ride?
                         
          It's the first real acknowledgement that he's taken Eddie

           I don't know who you are, Eddie, or
           what your game is, but I'm sure of
           one thing: you don't work in this
           business. I'm up to my ass in
           investment guys, and you don't have
           their half-cocky, half-terrified
           line of bullshit. Which is not to
           say I like yours any better.
                         
          He picks up a file, hands it to Eddie.
                         
           VAN LOON (CONT'D)
           But you obviously pick your stocks

                          EDDIE

           Well -- you're upmarket energy --

           solar/windmill/hippie outfits?

          A flicker in Van Loon's eyes. Bullseye.

           bridge...
                         
          He steps off the curb.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           Suddenly...
                         
          A SHARP, JARRING
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          EXT. HOUSTON STREET - NIGHT
                         
          Eddie is stepping off another curb, God knows where.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           There was another skip.

          He stops, rocked.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           How had I gone that last 20 blocks?
           I got another ten...
                         
          ON EDDIE WALKING...
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           ... then...
                         
          ...in mid-step...
                         
          EXT. UPPER 5TH AVENUE - NIGHT
                         
          Eddie is walking past the Metropolitan Museum.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           I was back uptown.
                         
          A SHARP, JARRING CUT TO:
                         
          INT. A CLUB - NIGHT
                         
          Eddie is suddenly sitting at a bar, picking up a drink,
          people around him...
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           What bar was this? Was it
           Harlem...?
                         
          A SHARP, JARRING CUT TO:
                         
          Eddie is dancing with a BEAUTIFUL BLACK WOMAN...
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           Same bar? Different bar? How long
           had passed...?
                         
          He breaks away from her, starts for the door...
                         
          A SHARP, JARRING CUT TO:
                         
          INT. A CLUB LADIES ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Eddie comes to in the act of banging THE BEAUTIFUL BLACK
          WOMAN savagely, against the stall door.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           And it happened again--

          EXT. HARLEM STREET IN FRONT OF BAR
                         
          Bam! A LARGE BLACK MAN crumples in front of Eddie -- goes
          down, hit, blood pouring from his nose. (Could he be the
          boyfriend of the girl Eddie's just banged?) Eddie stares at
          his bloody fist. It hurts--!
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           And again...
                         
          INT. A LOFT - NIGHT
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           And again...
                         
          Eddie sits on a plush sofa with several MIDDLE-AGED
          INTERNATIONAL TYPES, some chattering in Italian.
                         
          He has a drink in his hand. There are paintbrushes, paints
          and canvasses strewn around... a live/work space.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           And again...
                         
          A SHARP, JARRING CUT TO:

          INT. A HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
                         
          Eddie is walking down the plush corridor with an ATTRACTIVE
          MIDDLE-AGED LATIN WOMAN we saw at the artist's loft... Now
          it's just FLASHES --skimming stones of consciousness-A WINE
          CORK being popped. A PLATE OF MUSSELS swimming in wine sauce.
          Rumpled SHEETS. And then...A BLUR OF MOTION -- bodies, a
          swirl of riotous color --
                         
          A FRENZY OF SHOTS: A CAB STOPPING. A GARGOYLE ON A BUILDING.
          A DOG LEASH ABANDONED IN A PUDDLE. No rhyme, no reason, just
          image, image, image...
                         
          And then blackness.
                         
          EXT. THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAWN
                         
          Eddie is walking, now with a limp. He stops. Looks back. The
          familiar postcard view of Manhattan is ahead of him, looking
          like it always looks.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           When it finally stopped, I couldn't
           account for the last eight hours of
           my life.

          He notices his foot hurts when he puts it down. He has a
          limp.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           There was nothing to do but walk
           home.
                         
          He turns around and limps back towards the island.
                         
          INT. EDDIE'S BEDROOM - MORNING
                         
          Eddie is sleeping in all his clothes.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           It was my first sleep in two days.
                         
          INT. EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
                         
          Eddie, looking very groggy, is holding a THICK PACKET marked
          "Van Loon Associates, -BY COURIER." The files Carl Van Loon
          sent. Sitting on the dining table is an MDT tablets. He
          stares at them.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           Should I? Would I start "skipping
           time" again?
                         
          He pushes the tablets away. Doesn't take them.
                         
          ANOTHER ANGLE - TIME CUT
                         
          Eddie is sitting in his reading chair, exhausted, going
          through the paperwork.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           Even off MDT, I decided to give Van
           Loon's files a shot.
                         
          VAN LOON'S FILES - CLOSE
                         
          Eddie leafs through them... pieces of paper charting
          corporate growth, covered with charts, graphs, and mind-
          numbing statistics. PUSH IN ON Eddie's face, as he
          realizes...
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           They were fucking hieroglyphs.
                         
          INT. A WALL STREET OFFICE - DAY
                         
          The phone rings. Kevin Doyle picks it up.

           Hello--? Eddie--? What are you
           talking about?
                         
          And we CROSS-CUT between them:
                         
                          EDDIE
           I can't make the meeting, I'm,
           uh... I'm sick.
                         
          It's a lame excuse, it sounds lame as he says it, but then,
          he's off MDT.
                         
                          KEVIN
           Yeah, well, you can't have the
           fucking flu right now -- he'll
           never give you this chance again!
                         
                          EDDIE
           I need to, ah, analyze this data-
                         
          We see the two men continue to talk, Kevin growing more
          agitated, Eddie growing more sheepish as we HEAR:
                         
           EDDIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           Already I recognized it... the
           thick tongue, the leaden synapses.
           It was regular Eddie - the Eddie
           that, now, was unbearable to be.
                         
          We FADE UP THE SOUND on the two men:
                         
                          KEVIN
           ... Don't you get it?! This is your
           test--!
                         
                          EDDIE
           Well, I can't pass a fucking test
           right now!
                         
                          KEVIN
           And how am I going to look if you
           don't?
                         
          Eddie looks pretty bad. He massages his temples.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Okay, Kevin. Okay.
                         
          He hands up on a still-yammering Doyle. He picks up the MDT
          pill, looks at it.

           It was my first morning off MDT in
           a month. The beginnings of a
           headache was curling around my head
           like a big fat, greasy python.
                         
          Again, he looks at the MDT tablet, weighing his options.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           But the time-skips had me scared.
                         
          He puts the tablet back down on the table.
                         
          INT. THE REGENCY HOTEL RESTAURANT - DAY
                         
          Eddie walks in, much more tentative in his stride, fear in
          his eyes. This is the real Eddie, the non-MDT Eddie and he
          feels suddenly out of place with the curly maple paneling
          antique Persian carpets.
                         
           EDDIE (V.O.)
           My thought -- such as I had one --
           was to tap dance with Van Loon
           until I could find out more about
           MDT.

          opposite, watching him.
                         
                          VAN LOON
           What do you know about Hank Atwood?
                         
                          EDDIE
           Uh... iconoclast... owns, um, a lot
           of Colorado...
                         
          He's struggling.
                         
                          VAN LOON
           Uh-huh. So this is "prepared,"
           Eddie?
                         
          He shoots Eddie a look of withering contempt. Eddie holds the
          stare and shoots a look back.
                         
                          EDDIE
           What is this, Atwood 101? Everyone

           Nowhere.
                         
          An agonizing pause. Then Van Loon nods.
                         
                          VAN LOON
           Two years ago Forbes didn't even

           Yeah, his Great Leap Forward.
                         
          Eddie is faking it. Pierce is looking at him intently. But
          Eddie's staying afloat.
                         
                          VAN LOON
           The guy comes on, out of nowhere,
           so fucking strong he has me on the
           run. Beat me out of two properties,
           invests in bumfuck countries with
           no oil, places I wouldn't go near,
           sextuples his money.
                         
          Eddie's glance flicks to the TV behind the bar. A WOMAN'S
          PICTURE flashes on the TV screen -- and he recognizes it.
          It's the ITALIAN WOMAN he met last night!

          Eddie strains to hear the ANCHORWOMAN'S VOICE...
                         
                          ANCHORWOMAN

           last night, victim of foul play.
                         
          Eddie tries to keep his face immobile. Van Loon's voice
          drones on, distorted now, as we HEAR Eddie's heart pounding.
                         
                          VAN LOON
           ...100 billion if he has a
           nickel... and I have to convince
           him, somehow, that I can raise his
           game.

           An unidentified eyewitness has
           reported seeing a man with a limp
           leaving the scene.

          Eddie bolts upright.
                         
                          VAN LOON
           You can't tell me he's in this to
           improve the fucking planet. He
           owns a ball team.
                         
          Eddie is pale, sweaty, faint. There's only one thing to do:
                         
                          EDDIE
           Excuse me.
                         
          Eddie dashes out. Van Loon and Pierce look at each other.
                         
          EXT. THE REGENCY - NIGHT
                         
          Eddie bursts from the door, VOMITS into the gutter.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           I couldn't have.
                         
          He leans against a street sign, trying to right himself. He
          gasps for breath.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

          Eddie comes in, breathing wildly, panicked.
                         
           EDDIE (V.O.)
           If I could walk, talk, conduct
           business, seduce a woman, fight--
           with no memory... could I kill
           someone? Was it even me? Who was
           I?!
                         
          Immediately the PHONE RINGS. He nearly jumps out of his skin.
          He can't answer. He sits on the couch, head in his hands,
          rocking, as it rings. Finally, the machine picks up.

          Eddie sits on the bed, the black book open on his knees.
          Eddie looks at the page, then reaches for the telephone.
          Picks it up. Hears STRANGE CLICKS over the dial tone.
                         
          He puts down the phone, fear on his face.

          Eddie walks, slipping through the crowd, trying to suppress
          his limp... he looks nervously behind him... is that MAN in
          the TAN RAINCOAT following him? He tries to walk faster, but
          it makes his limp more pronounced. He turns the corner. He
          seems to have lost the guy.

          Eddie turns to the last page of Vernon's book.
                         
           EDDIE (V.O.)
           Of all the people I called, three
           were dead, and the rest were sick.
                         
                         
          Eddie dials the last number. Instantly, there is a RING. We
          RACK FOCUS TO-The MAN in the TAN COAT, sitting a discreet
          distance from Eddie. His phone is ringing. Eddie turns white.
                         
          The man takes out his cell phone and answers.

           Hello...? Hello...?
                         
          The man suddenly looks up. Locks eyes with Eddie. Knows that
          he knows. Eddie leaps up, begins to run. The man leaps up and
          follows.
                         
          EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY
                         
          Eddie runs desperately, as fast as a person off MDT possibly
          can.
                         
          He still has the limp from his blackout escapade, too. He
          can't run fast.
                         
          Tan Coat is gaining. Eddie collides with pedestrians, steps
          on street sunglass displays, sends a saxophonist sprawling.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           In the end, my stupidity saved me.
                         
          Eddie, panicked, not looking, runs for the crosswalk.

          EDDIE is frozen. The TRUCK SWERVES, up on the curb. Tan Coat
          must dive out of the way, knocking down pedestrians like
          bowling pins, as the TRUCK hits a STREETLIGHT, mangling it --
          then is WHACKED -- twice -- by TWO CABS piling up behind it.
          When Tan Coat extracts himself from the pile of prone
          pedestrians, his last glimpse is of-

           EDDIE (V.0.)
           What was I dealing with? Who could

           Eddie...?
                         
          Eddie turns back. There, sitting at a booth, is a thick-
          waisted, short-haired brunette middle-aged woman, wearing a
          large, shapeless sweater. Eddie had looked right at her...
          and not recognized her. She bears no relationship to the
          siren Melissa of his memories. Eddie tries to hide the shock
          on his face.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Melissa...?
                         
          He goes to her, sits. Yes, it's the same person, but
          dramatically, tragically changed. Her face is puffy, her
          pallor blotchy. There are lines under her eyes and around her
          mouth, lines brought on by more than the passage of a few
          years.
                         
          Eddie tries to conceal his shock.

           Don't tell me I look good, because

           I mean, I did it too. And I only
           took nine or ten hits. Vernon
           didn't tell you any of this, did
           he?
                         
                          EDDIE
           No.
                         
          Melissa snorts as if to say, typical.
                         
                          MELISSA
           Well, when he told me about this
           amazing new drug...

           I was like, down the hatch. And it
           was amazing. I read Brian Greene's
           The Elegant Universe in 45 minutes
           and understood it. My work rate
           increased... just, insanely,
           overnight. My boss started to hate
           me -- they offered me his job. And
           then I got scared.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Why?
                         
                          MELISSA
           I'm not stupid. I mean, nobody can
           keep up that level of mental
           activity and not crash. I stopped
           taking it.
                         
                          EDDIE
           And...?
                         
                          MELISSA
           I got sick. Headaches, throwing
           up... I went back to Vernon to see
           if I maybe shouldn't take another
           hit, or half a hit, and then he
           told me about... about the people
           who were dying. One guy didn't die,
           but he's a vegetable, his mother
           has to sponge him down every day...
                          (BEAT)
           How much have you been taking,
           Eddie?
                         
          A long beat as they look into each other's eyes.
                         
                          EDDIE
           A lot.
                         
                          MELISSA
           Well, maybe they've worked out the
           bugs. Maybe... maybe this isn't the
           same batch...
                         
          Eddie hates the look in her eyes. His hands are at his
          temples.
                         
                          MELISSA (CONT'D)

           Finish your story.
                         
                          MELISSA
           Well, I didn't take more. And I
           didn't die. But after a while I
           found I couldn't concentrate on
           anything for longer than ten
           minutes. I missed deadlines. I got
           lazy... and slow... put on
           weight... the magazine let me go.
           My husband checked out. Sex? Get
           out of here.
                         
          She leans back, looks him in the eyes.

           That was two years ago, and I
           haven't been the same since. I
           can't read any more -- I mean, the
           fucking New York Post?
                         
          Eddie feels ill, physically ill, hearing this.
                         
                          MELISSA (CONT'D)
           After this, I'm going to have a
           migraine for three days. And I've
           got to pee. Which is another thing.
                         
          She gets up... goes to the Ladies room. And now Eddie sees --
          she wears a LEG BRACE. Like a kid, from the old days, with
          Polio.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           How many times had I thought of
           her, my first real love...
                         
          We see FLASHES OF YOUNG MELISSA...
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           But that Melissa had unraveled in
           time and space -- she was a ghost
           now. I was never going to see her
           again, never bump into her in the
           street...
                         
          The tears gather behind Eddie's eyes. He can't help it. He
          puts his hand to his face to hide his emotions.

          EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
                         
          Eddie leaves with Melissa. He is controlling his tears --
          barely.
                         
                          MELISSA
           You have some left? Good. Go home
           and take it. Take the dose down,
           but don't just stop -- you'll die
           if you just stop. Try to taper off.
           Otherwise, the headache's just the
           beginning... I have to go--
                         
          Eddie, indeed, is rubbing his temples.
                         
                          EDDIE
           But when I run out--
                         
                          MELISSA
           I don't know. I have to go--
                         
          Eddie catches her arm.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Who invented MDT?

           Goodbye, Eddie.
                         
          He lets go of her arm. A puffy, crippled woman about to cry.
          She turns her back and moves away from him, stiffly, limping,
          without looking back.

           EDDIE (V.O.)
           No one seemed to be watching my
           apartment, maybe I could chance it.
                         
                         ON EDDIE
                         
          He glances around - the coast is clear - and sets off across
          the street. He looks weak, ill - his breathing labored. He
          stumbles - catches himself
                         
           EDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           I was getting sicker by the moment.
           Luckily I had one pill on me...
                         
          He pulls it from his pocket.

          WHAM! He's pushed up against the wall of his building. Not
          by Tan Coat.
                         
          By GENNADY THE RUSSIAN.

          Eddie is stunned -- Gennady whacked his head against the
          building pretty hard. He still clutches the MDT tablet tight
          in his fist.
                         
                          EDDIE

                          EDDIE
           I'm here now!
                         
          INT. EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM - ON THE DOOR
                         
          They come into his apartment, Eddie using all his energy to
          stay upright.
                         
                          EDDIE
           I'll get you a check.
                         
          Gennady turns to ice.
                         
                          GENNADY
           A check? A check?! You out of your
           fucking mind?! What you think we
           are, some financial institution?
                         
          Eddie realizes his brain isn't working --of course Gennady
          can't take a check.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Gennady, look-
                         
                          GENNADY
           I cut your balls off!
                         
                          EDDIE
           I wasn't thinking. Look, we just
           need to go to my bank- OOF!
                         
          Gennady has punched him in the stomach. Harder than he's ever
          been punched. Eddie gasps for breath... holds his fist to his
          body, protecting the pill. Gennady notices.

          Gennady grabs Eddie's wrist and wrenches his hand open.
                         
                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           It's aspirin.
                         
          Gennady snatches the pill away from him. Examines it.
                         
                          GENNADY
           Don't look like no aspirin I ever

          His voice drips with crude contempt.

          Eddie's shaking hands are handing Gennady a thick envelope.
                         
                          EDDIE
           That's the whole thing, plus
           twenty.
                         
          He looks desperately ill. He can barely stand. Gennady,
          meanwhile, is coming on to MDT.
                         
                          GENNADY
           I feel good. What in that shit?
                         
                          EDDIE
           Aspirin and vitamins.
                         
                          GENNADY
           You fucking full of shit, Morgan. I

           too.
                         
          He wants to hit Eddie again, but thinks the better of it with
          all the bank cameras.

          Eddie lurches along the street, staggering like a drunk,
          barely able to walk. People avoid him, veering away.
                         
           EDDIE (V.O.)
           I had to get my stash.
                         
          INT. LINDY'S OFFICE - DAY
                         
          Lindy clearly has a mid-level executive job; her office is
          better than a cubicle and she has a bit of a view. There is a
          KNOCK. A FEMALE ASSISTANT appears in the door.
                         
                          FEMALE ASSISTANT
           Lindy...? I wouldn't have let him
           in, but I know you know him...
                         
          EDDIE appears in the door, looking deathly ill.
                         
                          LINDY
           It's all right, Lisa.
                         
          The girl goes. Lindy, sensing something dire, leaps up and
          closes the door.
                         
          Eddie immediately collapses on the floor. Lindy kneels down
          to help him - competent, trying to stay calm.

          The MDT IS NOT THERE. The broiler is slammed down in anger.

          Lindy enters. Tense, panicked. She walks to a SQUARE END
          TABLE, takes the lamp off it. The table is actually a box --
          she lifts the lid. She reaches in... and pulls out the PACKET
          OF MDT.

          There is a KNOCK on the DOOR. Lying on the floor, trying to
          breathe, Eddie ignores it. His PHONE rings again. It takes a
          lot of effort just to answer it.

          Lindy bolts from the cab just as TAN COAT puts his hand on
          the opposite door. She takes off into Central Park. And he's

          Lindy veers off the path, through the trees, zig-zagging,

          Up ahead, miraculously, A COP ON HORSEBACK. He steps the
          horse toward her. She races over and presses her body against
          the side of the horse.

          The cop seems to be paying attention, then suddenly GRUNTS

          HIS HORSE to the ground... ...revealing TAN COAT, on the
          other side of the horse. The BLADE in his hand is bloody.
          LINDY runs.... tries to lose herself in a WEDDING PARTY...
          comes to a section of huge, decorative BOULDERS and ROCKS.
          Dives behind one of them.
                         
          Ahead, she can see the outdoor ICE SKATERS, couples,
          families, enjoying the ice. It seems surreal. Several yards
          behind her is TAN COAT, looking behind every tree, every
          trash bin. Lindy picks up the phone, keeping her voice low,
          although she's hyperventilating.

           He's got a knife -- I can't think
           my way out of a knife--!
                         
                          EDDIE
           You'll come on in thirty seconds.
           And yes, you will think your way
           out, that's what it does. Are you
           taking it--?
                         
          She swallows the pill.
                         
                          LINDY
                          (A BEAT)
           Yes. He's getting closer.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Lindy. I love you.

           --Lindy? Are you there?
                         
          A beat. We PUSH IN on Lindy's eyes. Which are changing.
          Growing more steely. Determined.

           Eddie...? I feel it.
                         
          She hangs up. Eddie is left looking at the phone.
                         
          EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY
                         
          Tan Coat is perhaps five yards behind Lindy and getting
          closer. But she's not crying any more. She's looking at-THE
          ICE SKATING RINK, and the skaters, whirling across the ice.
                         
                         LINDY'S
                         
          eyes flash. She knows what to do. Suddenly, she BOLTS from
          her hiding place behind the rock, tearing down the hill as
          fast as she can. Tan Coat is behind her like a shot.
                         
          EXT. THE ICE SKATING RINK - DAY
                         
          Lindy races down the hill, pushing past the line of people,
          and onto the ice... Tan Coat is clearly desperate --he
          doesn't give a shit who sees him chasing her.
                         
          In a flash, he's on the ice after Lindy, running and sliding.
          People collide with him, he pushes skaters aside, sending
          them sprawling... Just as he's closing in on Lindy...
                         
          Lindy wheels around, grabs a SIX YEAR OLD GIRL under the
          arms, and HOISTS HER INTO THE AIR, swinging her legs at Tan
          Coat as hard she can! The little girl's skates arc through
          the air --whoosh! -and connect, CUTTING Tan Coat's FACE.
          Badly.
                         
          He sinks to his knees, hand to his cheek, welling blood.
          People scream and scatter. Lindy keeps her wits about her.
          She runs, sliding across the ice, and leaping the fence, with
          surprising grace. She's gone.
                         
          INT. LINDY'S OFFICE - DAY - ON EDDIE'S HAND - CLOSE
                         
          as an MDT pill is put into it. A WIDER SHOT shows Eddie
          swallowing it with a glass of water.
                         
                         LINDY
                         
          sits across the room, looking at him, her expression cool and
          composed.
                         
          They look at each other, a look of understanding.

          Eddie finishes checking in, Lindy beside him. He seems
          completely restored to his sharp, snappy self. The desk clerk
          gives him a key. He puts his arm around her, leads her to the
          elevators.
                         
          INT. W HOTEL - ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Eddie takes Lindy's hands, sits her on the bed.
                         
                          EDDIE
           We'll stay here for a couple of
           days. We'll be powered up, we'll be
           able to think our way out of
           this...
                         
          He kisses her hands. Looks into her eyes.
                         
                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           I'm back. All right?
                         
          Lindy looks at him for a long moment.
                         
                          LINDY
           Who's back, Eddie?
                         
                          EDDIE
           I can take care of you now.
                         
                          LINDY
           That was never what I wanted.
                         
                          EDDIE
           A lot's going to happen for us. And
           everything that I will have... I
           will share with you. I will love
           you.
                         
          Lindy's head comes up. She looks at him, steely.
                         
                          LINDY
           You know... you were always smart.
           You could have done this. Not
           this... but some of these things...
           maybe a third of these things...
           without any smart drug at all. A
           third of all this... to most
           people...? ...would be plenty.
                         
          She gets up, turns away from him.

           I understand that stuff now, Eddie.
           And I don't blame you for taking
           it. No one could ever tell you,
           till you take it, what it can do.
           Invincibility in a bottle. And I
           know I'm going to think about
           taking it again every day for the
           rest of my life.
                         
          There's eerie quiet to her tone that Eddie hasn't heard
          before. A matter-of-fact chill.
                         
                          LINDY (CONT'D)
           But once you can see everything
           that way, mapped out like that, on
           a grid... and always be right...?
           Who'd want to wing it? Who'd want
           to fuck up? Who'd want to be human?
                         
          She heads for the door.
                         
                          LINDY (CONT'D)
           I just came up to say goodbye. I
           don't ever want to see you again.
           I'm not even going to stay in New
           York. Don't try to find me, and
           don't try to help me.
                         
          She goes. He knows there's no point in stopping her. She's
          done with him.
                         
          EXT. W HOTEL - LATER
                         
          Eddie at the WINDOW, looking down...
                         
          EXT. EDDIE'S POV - THE STREET
                         
          He sees Lindy briskly walking away. RACK FOCUS as Lindy
          passes... GENNADY. Leaning against a sign post. Lighting a
          cigarette. And looking up at Eddie's hotel. Waiting.
                         
          EXT. W HOTEL - DAY
                         
          Gennady stands there, looking up at the hotel. So he's a
          little surprised to find EDDIE walking right up to him.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Looking for me?
                         
          Gennady quickly gets aggressive:

                          EDDIE
           I was under the impression that our
           business was settled.
                         
          Something is jammed into Eddie's ribs. Something under
          Gennady's coat. Eddie doesn't blink.
                         
                          GENNADY
           Walk.
                         
          Gennady walks him around the corner, down some stairs, to the
          (deserted) ground entrance of someone's apartment. Eddie
          remains cool.
                         
                          EDDIE
           So now you're going to rob me? I
           thought you were a businessman.
                         
                          GENNADY
           I want some more of that shit.
                         
                          EDDIE
           What shit.
                         
                          GENNADY
           The pills.
                         
          He whacks Eddie, hard, across the face. Eddie, stoic, on MDT,
          doesn't react.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Well, so do I. You took the last
           one.
                         
                          GENNADY
           So you get me more.
                         
                          EDDIE
           I can't get more -- the dealer's
           dead.
                         
          Now Gennady smiles.
                         
                          GENNADY
           Oh. Well. Too bad for you. Because
           how you gonna go to those fancy
           meetings with your nose fed to my
           dog?

                          EDDIE

                          EDDIE
           A hundred can't happen. The
           dealer's dead, I have to call three
           people to even get a line on--
                         
          The gun barrel is brought up beneath Eddie's chin.
                         
                          GENNADY
           You know I don't really do this. So
           clean, like this. What I do to you,
           I do in stages.

                          GENNADY
           Ten. Fuck your ten.
                         
                          EDDIE
           (holding his ground)
           Ten. And no guarantee there's more.
                         
          Gennady looks at him for a long, menacing moment.
                         
                          GENNADY
           Oh, I think guarantee.
                         
          But he's accepted the ten. For now. He PUSHES Eddie against
          the wall, hard, knocking the wind out of him.

                          VAN LOON
           I didn't ask for your projections.
                         
                          EDDIE
           I know, but I think if you look at
                          THEM-
                         
                          VAN LOON
           I already have.
                         
          A long beat as the two men size each other up. Van Loon looks
          away, but a tiny smile creases the corner of his mouth.
                         
           VAN LOON (CONT'D)
           As a matter of fact, there were
           firings over your projections.
                         
                          EDDIE
           I'm sorry.

           Two months after I started MDT, I
           was helping broker the most
           important merger in corporate
           history.
                         
          Eddie sits with Van Loon, Pierce, and several POWERFUL
          LOOKING MEN, conferring. They look at an elaborate
          chart/graph that Eddie is sketching... even Pierce, his
          detractor, looks impressed.

           EDDIE (V.O.)
           I found that if I maintained an
           even dose... remembered to eat...
           drank no alcohol... the blackouts
           didn't recur.
                         
          Eddie shakes one MDT pill into his hand, downs it.

           Quite large.
                         
          The Tailor nods, makes a note. He's certainly not going to
          ask any questions.

           I don't want it known that I have
           any security. You won't precede me,
           you'll follow me, never less than
           ten steps behind... `inconspicuous'
           doesn't begin to describe you.
           You're not there. You're a CEO'S

          furtive meeting Eddie is having with a TECHNICIAN, who passes
          back a small PLASTIC ENVELOPE to Eddie. In it we see SEVERAL

           Well, it's nothing you can cook up

           so of course information about its

           You haven't asked the question.
                         
                          EDDIE
           All right. If all this comes
           off... what's my take?
                         
                          VAN LOON
           You should have pre-negotiated.
                         
                          EDDIE
           I trust you.
                         
                          VAN LOON
           You shouldn't.
                         
          Eddie returns Van Loon's look coolly, implying that it really
          might be in Van Loon's best interest to trust him.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Well, given the scale of my
           contribution, it can't be anything
           lese than forty. Let's say forty-
           five.
                         
                          VAN LOOK

                          VAN LOON
           Forty million's plenty, Eddie.
           There's plenty more where this came
           from.
                         
          He tries to read Eddie's smile which is removed, far away...
                         
                          VAN LOOK
           ...But you're not going to continue
           working for me, are you?
                         
          Eddie opens his mouth. Pauses.
                         
                          VAN LOON
           Don't lie. You're already bored.
           Onto the next...?
                         
          Van Loon didn't get to where he is for nothing.
                         
           VAN LOON (CONT'D)
           I would really love to know what,
           after a forty million dollar
           payout, is "next" to you. But
           you're not going to tell me that,
           either.
                          (SMILES)
           And I'm not sure I want to know.
           Might singe my ego.
                         
          He shakes Eddie's hand.
                         
           VAN LOON (CONT'D)
           I'll open a line of credit for you.

          INT. A HUGE, DELUXE EMPTY APARTMENT - (THE CELESTIAL) - DAY
                         
          Eddie is being shown the apartment by a thirty-something
          female REALTOR. The apartment is still under construction --
          brand new -- and enormous, with a wall of floor-to-ceiling
          windows in the living room showing off spectacular views.
                         
                          REALTOR
           ... three restaurants, health club,
           of course, a private screening
           room, wine cellar, walk-in
           humidor... unparalleled, three-tier
           security system...

                          REALTOR
           Twelve point five.
                         
          Eddie has to look away from her, biting his lip. He can't
          show her any sign of sticker shock. The face he turns back to
          her is composed, even blase. He shrugs -- no problem!
                         
          We see an almost sexual excitement dance in her eyes.

           It was, as it turned out, a good
           moment to move.
                         
          Eddie comes in. The room has been completely ripped to pieces
          -- just like Eddie's apartment. Eddie just smiles. Because
          there was nothing for anyone to find.

           No one knew, or would ever know,
           that I now carried the pills with
           me at all times.
                         
          Eddie stands, waiting, his two security guys lurking 10 steps
          behind. GENNADY appears, now with TWO RUSSIAN THUGS of his
          own. This is new, and Eddie wasn't expecting it.
                         
          Gennady's security guys eye Eddie's security guys, and vice
          versa. Gennady is wearing a suit and looks much more
          sophisticated. Eddie hands Gennady a small envelope. Gennady
          takes it. In his eyes is a penetrating intelligence.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           Right away, it was obvious he was
           on MDT.
                         
          Gennady whips out a silver lighter and lights himself a
          cigarette. His movements are elegant, refined.
                         
                          GENNADY

          Gennady's eyebrow goes up. Gennady's security guys reach into
          their jackets. So do Eddie's guys. Gennady's eyes flick over
          the situation, motion to his guys to keep still. Gennady
          laughs, an unpleasant sound.
                         
                          GENNADY
           I don't think your Forbes 400 new

           with the police?
                         
          Gennady turns with a flourish and walks off. Over his
          shoulder, with smug confidence:
                         
                          GENNADY (CONT'D)
           Thursday. You have them here.
                         
          Gennady turns, walks to the curb, where a NEW BLACK TOWN CAR
          is waiting for him and his boys.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           Obviously, this could not go on.
           But there is very little on this
           earth that 45 million dollars can't
           solve. And tomorrow at nine, Atwood

           Obviously, it wouldn't be in our

          She shakes both of their hands. A driver has the door open

          SECURITY GUYS. He is thinking.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           Well. Why be surprised? How many
           other meteoric rises might be
           explained by MDT? At least I had
           some; my life wasn't in jeopardy.
           Only my money...

           EDDIE (V.0.)
           ...and my liberty.
                         
          Eddie stands with his favorite POLICE DETECTIVE and his
          lawyer in an anteroom leading to an institutional door. His
          lawyer talks to him, low.
                         
                          MORRIS BRANDT
           I've been all over them... we can't
           allow any disparity in race or
           physical type between you and the
           rest of the lineup -- they're as
           close to your clones as I could
           possibly get away with -- it's
           going to be one big handsome blur
           to this guy-
                         
          A FEMALE COP approaches Eddie.
                         
                          FEMALE COP
           Mr. Morgan...? I need you to change
           your jacket.

                          EDDIE
           Why?
                         
                          MORRIS BRANDT
           Oh, that's me... I want everyone in
           the same shirt, better for the blur
           factor...
                         
          A beat.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Of course.
                         
          Another beat of hesitation... then Eddie hands Brandt his
          jacket, takes off his shirt, puts on the blue shirt... and
          stoically follows the female cop through the grubby door.

          Please turn to the right. Eddie and four other dark-haired
          guys turn to the right. Eddie looks at the black one-way
          window.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           Who was out there? The woman's
           husband? Was some bellboy I
           undertipped about to end my life?

           dithering.
                         
          Eddie blinks at him.
                         
           MORRIS BRANDT (CONT'D)
           "Maybe the third from the right...
           No not him..." --Oh. Here you go.
                         
          He hands Eddie back his jacket.
                         
           MORRIS BRANDT (CONT'D)
           (re: the jacket)
           Thing of beauty. You had it made?
                         
          Eddie just nods, his eyes steely. The lawyer feels the molten
          stare and hands the jacket back.

          Eddie rushes down the steps, two at a time, looks at his
          watch.

          Gennady, wearing a gorgeous cashmere coat, waits, now with
                         
          THREE SECURITY GUYS.
                         
          Gennady looks at his watch, then says something low and
          sinister in Russian to his associates.
                         
           EDDIE (V.O.)

          Eddie hurries into the room. Van Loon doesn't look up. He's
          watching a monitor, which has a live news feed to a financial
          channel.

                          VAN LOON
           No. Atwood's in a coma.
                         
                          EDDIE
           A coma?
                         
          Black looks between them as the newscaster continues.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           It had gotten out, somehow. But I
           felt thick, stupid, tired. A small
           pain was starting behind my eyes.
           I'd been unable to take my MDT, and
           I was overdue.
                         
          He shoots Van Loon a glance. Van Loon is miserably fixated on
          the TV.
                         
          INT. VAN LOON'S HUGE, SLEEK BATHROOM - DUSK
                         
          Eddie stands in a stall. Reaches into the lining of his coat.
          Unfastens the opening of the compartment.
                         
          CLOSE ON THE OPENING
                         
          There is nothing inside.
                         
          EDDIE,
                         
          panicked, feels again. Nothing. The MDT is simply not
          there!!! He begins to hyperventilate. Spin in place. Push
          against the stall walls, trying not to scream.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           Was it Brandt? Or someone else? The
           police station? A coat room? How?
           How?
                         
          He bursts from the stall, alone in the bathroom. Stares at
          himself, terrified, in the mirror.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           In an hour I'd be useless. In two

          eyed.
                         
                          VAN LOON
           Eddie--? This came for you.
                         
          Eddie looks at a LARGE BOX on Van Loon's desk. Indeed, his
          name is on it. Eddie, mystified, approaches it. As Van Loon
          continues to stare at the TV, disinterested in the box, Eddie
          gingerly opens it.

          Inside are the SEVERED HANDS OF EDDIE'S SECURITY GUYS. (One
          black hand, one with the distinctive tattoos.) Gennady.
          Clearly these guys are dead. Eddie grabs the box and starts
          from the room.
                         
                          VAN LOON

          desperate, shoving people out of the way to get to the
          elevators.

          His brow is beaded with sweat.

          PUSH IN on Eddie's eyes.

          on the table in front of him, head in his hands.
                         
          (The room is filled with labeled boxes he has never had a
          chance to unpack.) The TV is on in the background. It's a
          financial channel. We see MRS. HANK ATWOOD is giving a
          statement.
                         
           MRS. HANK ATWOOD
           There is absolutely no truth to the
           rumor of this merger. None
           whatsoever. My husband is having
           some tests, this is a difficult
           time, and I would appreciate your
           directing further questions to our
           attorney...
                         
          She motions at the gentleman next to her. --Who is also
          Eddie's attorney, MORRIS BRANDT. The one who was so helpful
          with the police. The one who held his jacket.
                         
          Bitter amusement in Eddie's eyes. At least he knows. The
          APARTMENT BUZZER buzzes. Eddie freezes. Looks at the door. It
          BUZZES again.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           It wasn't downstairs security,

           It was my inner door. Someone was

           right now.
                         
          Eddie walks to his phone, picks it up. Pushes the button,
          puts it to his ear. It's dead.
                         
          He pushes the "on" button again and again. Nothing. The
          buzzer BUZZES again. Eddie rushes to the door, opens the COAT
          CLOSET. In the closet is a state-of-the-art SECURITY MONITOR.
                         
          Gennady and TWO MEN are outside his door! Suddenly the
          MONITOR goes BLACK. Eddie flicks the switch on the monitor.
          Nothing. Eddie flicks the switch again. It's dead. Someone,
          somewhere, has figured out how to disarm it.
                         
          The buzzer BUZZES again. Eddie backs away from the door. We
          HEAR Eddie's shallow, panicked breathing. He lunges for his
          briefcase, pulls out his CELL PHONE.

           EDDIE (V.O.)
           And so... here I am.
                         
          And now we pick up Eddie where we left him, standing on the
          ledge.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           I knew they would kill me, slowly
           and horribly. But this choice would
           at least be mine.
                         
          We now hear the ZZZZZZZZ! of some major power tool drilling
          at the door, punctuated by more BAMS! -- one way or another
          they're going to get in. Eddie takes a breath, tries to jump.
          He can't.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           But we're instinctive creatures. We
           want to live.

           So, my foggy brain tried to
           remember... where one tablet of
           MDT... might be.
                         
                         
          We PUSH IN on Eddie's eyes... We are still REWINDING in
          Eddie's mind... images of where we've seen him keep MDT...
          nothing... nothing... nothing... We STOP at the SUGARBOWL on
          Eddie's dining table. Then go forward --no, wait!-rewinding,
          stopping again on the SUGAR BOWL. Pushing in on the sugar
          bowl.
                         
          Eddie spins around, looks back into his apartment, eyes
          intense.
                         
           EDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           It was possible. And possible was
           enough.
                         
                         
                         
          INT. THE CELESTIAL - EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Eddie is tearing through boxes as the POUNDING and DRILLING
          become deafening... he rips open a box labeled "Kitchen" -
          it's full of BOOKS. Mis-labeled. JUMP CUTS as he rips open
          other boxes... his hands frantically scattering CDs, cutlery,
          cans of food... The door begins to give. Under the deafening
                         DRILL:
                         
          MORE JUMP-CUTS as Eddie hysterically tears the packing paper
          off of promisingly- shaped objects. --No. A glass. --No. A
          vase. --YES! The sugar bowl. With sugar still inside! Eddie
          rummages, frantically, among the sugar cubes as the door
          gives a few inches, groaning, and we glimpse blurred faces on
          the other side...
                         
                         EDDIE'S HAND
                         
          pokes, wildly, among the cubes... pushing them aside,
          revealing at the bottom of the bowl-
                         
          ONE MDT TABLET looks back up at him.
                         
          Yes. It's really there! Eddie grabs it, just as, with a
          splintering CRASH! -- The door goes down.
                         
          Eddie steps back, brings the pill up to his mouth... But as
          he steps, he TRIPS on a SOUP CAN he's scattered... he FALLS
          backwards... his HAND hits the side of the coffee table...

          The MDT TABLET goes flying... (slow motion)... as... ...also
          in slow motion, Gennady and his two thugs smile as they
          advance into the room... THE MDT TABLET... flies... flies...
          towards a GRATE in the floor -- a heating vent -- and HITS
          it... rolling... ... before disappearing forever down the
          grate.
                         
          Eddie knows that's it. His life has ended. He sucks in his
          last breath -- then, with a YELL, he rushes back for the
          terrace... for his suicide leap...
                         
          Thug #1 is quicker. Gets to the door first. Eddie will not
          have the luck to be able to jump. He's trapped between the
          two Thugs.
                         
                          GENNADY
           I told you I want more. You don't
           listen. Maybe you think I'm
           joking...
                         
          He reaches into his coat pocket...
                         
                          GENNADY (CONT'D)
           But I'm down to this last one.
                         
          ...and pulls out a syringe.
                         
                          GENNADY (CONT'D)
           See, I dissolve pill in solution.
           You shoot it - goes straight into
           blood and to brain. Works much
           better.
                         
          He pulls the plastic sleeve off the needle. Jabs himself in
          the arm and injects the cloudy liquid.
                         
                          GENNADY (CONT'D)
           Now. Where do you keep yours?
                         
          Eddie is backed to the wall. Nowhere to go.
                         
                          EDDIE
           I'm plum out.
                         
          Gennady just smiles -- that was an unfortunate choice. He
          gives an order to the Thugs who grab their tools and
          disappear deeper into the apartment. WE HEAR them starting to
          tear things up. Gennady and Eddie are alone.
                         
                          GENNADY
           They will find it. Or I will make
           you tell me. Which is quicker? We
           see, huh?

          INT. EDDIE'S STUDY - NIGHT
                         
          Thug #2 has found, behind a bureau, a SAFE. He calls
          excitedly, in Russian, to the other room.
                         
          INT. EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Gennady calls back in Russian. Then picks up a particularly
          delicate, yet sharp-looking KNIFE.
                         
                          GENNADY
           This is a waste of my time, you
           know that? I am getting out of this
           part of the business... starting
           import-export company. Very
           exciting stuff. A lot on my plate.
           I need to learn to delegate...
                         
          Eddie is backed up against a table, which is covered with
          stuff he's scattered, which includes a BUTCHER BLOCK with A
          KNIFE in it... Gennady starts arranging his instruments.
                         
                          GENNADY (CONT'D)
           First, I will cut skin from you,
           flay you... you stay alive nice
           long time... then maybe we cut meat
           from you, steaks... or maybe softer
           parts... I get inspiration...
                         
          He looks up, smiles, to see the effect his words have on
          Eddie.
                         
                         ON EDDIE
                         
          Staring back at Gennady, hard, a fuck-you stare. We can't see
          behind Eddie's back, but we can see the butcher block, and
          the knife is gone.
                         
                         GENNADY
                         
          senses something is not right. Looks at Eddie quizzically.

          Eddie brings the knife up as hard as he can, right into
          Gennady's stomach. Gennady gasps in surprise, chokes,
          writhes. Eddie drives the knife home, harder, grabbing
          Gennady's other hand, which lashes at Eddie with the fillet
          knife...

          The men fall to the floor in a death-struggle. Eddie
          exhausted, off MDT, but determined not to let go. Gennady
          writhes, flails, but doesn't cry out... he's already choking
          on blood. Eyes shocked, surprised. Eddie turns the fillet
          knife back on Gennady, slashes at his other arm; blood
          spurts. But it's not necessary. Gennady's eyes are glazing.
          His gurgling gets quieter. He's quite dead.
                         
          Eddie lies alongside him, panting, arm grazed and welling
          blood from where Gennady's filleting knife slashed him,
          suddenly weak and exhausted.
                         
          From the other room comes the BRRRRRRR! sound of the drill --
          the boys, oblivious, are hard at work on the safe. Eddie
          tries to get up, then falls back.
                         
           EDDIE (V.O.)
           Not much of a triumph, was it?
                         
          He's got the shakes... no, more of a convulsion... he sinks
          back to the floor...
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           Because I would die here, too.
                         
          There is a break in the convulsion. Then another one starts.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
           Only MDT could help me, and the
           last of it was in this fuck's
           bloodstream...
                         
          Gennady's BLOOD wells around Gennady's body in a crimson
          puddle. A puddle that's creeping closer and closer to Eddie's
          face, which is lying, convulsing, on the floor...
                         
          ON EDDIE'S EYES
                         
          between convulsions, suddenly looking. Looking at the blood.
          It creeps closer to Eddie's face. Eddie is trying to move,
          trying to push his face closer to the blood... he's there...
                         
          And now he turns his face down into the blood.
                         
          And begins to lap it up.

          standing behind him --(he's been holding up his neighbor's
          body) and, just as this registers -- WHACK! -- Eddie gives
          THUG #1 a savage shot with a fireplace poker. Thug #1 goes

          THUG #2 dives, reaches for it. Eddie grabs a piece of the
          shattered glass and, in a vicious swipe, brings it down on
          the Thug's hand. But this guy is not a tough Russian
          motherfucker for nothing. Bleeding profusely, he doesn't let
          go of the gun... his bloody hand comes up, tries to aim...

          BLAM! BLAM! Several holes appear in the canvas as the thug
          tries to shoot Eddie anyway, but Eddie has leapt out of the

          thug, who now realizes he's standing in a puddle, the
          overturned can of BBQ fluid next to him. In an instant, his
          LEGS AND PANTS are on fire. Now the man screams. Shoots
          blindly. But - click! -- is out of bullets. He rushes at
          Eddie, screaming, on fire, in animal rage. Eddie brings up a
          wrought-iron patio chair to meet him, catching him squarely
          in the ribs. He gasps, bends over... looks up at Eddie,
          beaten...
                         
          The face that looks back is without pity.
                         
          EXT. THE CELESTIAL - 20 STORIES BELOW, A WIDER TERRACE - DAY
                         
          We are looking up at the penthouse. A SHAPE is dropping,
          fast, towards us -- the shape of a man.
                         
          It's here! The man's head EXPLODES against the railing like a
          pumpkin as the rest of him disappears down, out of sight.
                         
           EDDIE (V.0.)
           Later, it would be noted that my
           neighbor was in the music business.
           One of his drug deals had obviously
           gone bad...
                          (BEAT)
           And the night was still young.
                         
          INT. A HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          A MAN is on a gurney. A NURSE puts a sheet over his head.
          Before our view of his face disappears we realize --it's Hank
          Atwood. Dead.

          INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Tan Coat is sitting, stoic and red-eyed in a chair. He senses
          something. Slowly turns his head and looks.
                         
          EDDIE is sitting in the chair next to him. The two men look
          at each other for a moment. Then:
                         
                          EDDIE
           I'm sure you're curious about
           what's happened to your boss. I
           certainly am. If my attorney was
           really working for Mr. Atwood, to
           save his life, then why is he dead?
           At what point was the Pony Express
           supposed to ride in with the life-
           saving medication?
                          (A BEAT)
           Or, did the Pony decide that he
           should be running his own Pony
           show? Minus the dog.
                         
          Tan Coat stares at him, his face without expression.
                         
          INT. A CONNECTICUT UPPERCLASS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          AN UPPERCLASS HOUSEWIFE enters, in sweats, from the gym.
          Immediately notices something is not right...

          INT. HER BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          She rushes in. We SEE her husband - MORRIS BRANDT - tied up
          and gagged, struggling on the floor. Next to him, a smashed
          PICTURE. It once covered a WALL SAFE which is now open. The
          SAFE is empty.
                         
           EDDIE (V.O.)
           I would not go back. I would not be
           stopped.
                         
           FADE OUT.

          INT. A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN OFFICE - DAY
                         
          Desks, employees, volunteers, ringing phones. REUBEN, LATE
          20's, sharp, a JAMES CARVILLE-TYPE, sits on a desk with
          casual authority, is on the phone.
                         
                          REUBEN
           ...actually, no, there's no more
           tickets. --Yeah, I know, an
           overbooked fundraiser -- there's a
           first -- well, here he comes, I'll
           ask him -- Edward!!
                         
          We see Eddie striding down the corridor, wearing a sharp
          suit, looking more dignified than we've ever seen him, more
          adult. The snap and crackle of something new -- power -- is
          in his step. TWO MALE AIDES flank him. Reuben approaches,
          falls into step with them.
                         
                          REUBEN (CONT'D)
           I think we're looking at a second,
           overflow event-- there's a wave of
           donations coming in -- and I don't
           think they're even going to try a
           second debate -- don't go yet --
                         
                          EDDIE
           I have a lunch.
                         
          They have arrived at Eddie's office. Reuben nods at the
          closed door.
                         
                          REUBEN
           John Steadman's in there.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Who's that?
                         
                          REUBEN
           --Eiben-Chemcorps? Look, they're
           your biggest contributor, give him
           his two shitty little minutes.
                         
          Eddie sighs, capitulating. Puts his hand on the door.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Eiben-Chemcorps. What are they --
           research?
                         
                          REUBEN
           Pharmaceuticals.
                         
          Eddie shoots him a look.

          INT. A LARGE, CASUAL OFFICE - DAY
                         
          Eddie comes in to find JOHN STEADMAN, 50's, well-dressed and
          gentlemanly, waiting.
                         
                          STEADMAN
           Mr. Morgan.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Nice to see you.
                         
          He shakes Steadman's hand, but Steadman doesn't get up. Odd.
          In fact Steadman looks uncommonly relaxed, almost slouched in
          his chair, looking up at Eddie with a subtle gleam in his eye
          that Eddie doesn't recognize.
                         
                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           We appreciate everything you've
           done for us--
                         
                          STEADMAN
           Well, you've done most of it for
           yourself. Senator Morgan.
                         
          He says this with a kind of casual, prescient authority. And
          suddenly, we know he's right. Eddie will win.
                         
                          STEADMAN (CONT'D)
           I mean, everything from here's a
           technicality, isn't it, Eddie?
                         
          Again, that smile. Eddie doesn't know what this guy is
          about. And nobody calls him "Eddie" any more.
                         
                          STEADMAN (CONT'D)
           I think we both know where it's
           heading...
                          (A BEAT)
           If... you can maintain.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Maintain?
                         
                          STEADMAN
           Eventually you'll run out. I just
           want you to know we're here to help
           you.
                         
          Eddie blinks at him. Did he just say what Eddie thought he
          said?
                         
                          EDDIE

           We've gotten most of the bugs out.
           It's longer lasting - you'll only
           have to take one a week.
                         
          Eddie is now dead silent. A long beat. Is it possible? Is
          he really talking to someone who makes MDT?!
                         
                          EDDIE
           Have you been watching me from the

                          STEADMAN
           No. Those of you who indulged...
           distinguished yourselves very
           quickly. You made yourselves clear
           to us.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Who's "us?"
                         
          Steadman just smiles, waves the question away.
                         
                          STEADMAN
           You went the furthest with it the
           fastest, so of course, to us,
           you're the most interesting.
                         
                          EDDIE
           How did it get on the street?
                         
                          STEADMAN
           Security breach. That was never
           our intention. We took care of it.
                         
          Meaning, they took care of Vern.
                         
                          STEADMAN (CONT'D)
           It will never again be on the
           street. It will never publicly
           exist. Obviously I don't need to
           detail the advantages for you.
                         
          A long beat. Eddie doesn't trust this guy -- not a bit.
                         
                          EDDIE
           And what about for you? Why don't
           you take it?
                         
                          STEADMAN
           We don't have to. You'll take it

           Just keep on doing what you're

           first.

           Well, given where you're heading,
           some of our ideas are... grandiose.
           But, I think, achievable.
                         
          Eddie takes that in.
                         
                          EDDIE

           Then we'll say Godspeed. And your

           But let's not even go there. Right
           now you should feel relieved, your
           problems are over. We just want to
           keep you healthy... and brilliant.

           Luckily I can do that myself.

           Well, no, ah, that won't be the

          Steadman stops, looks back at him.
                         
                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           Did I kill that woman?
                         
          Steadman looks puzzled that Eddie would ask.
                         
                          STEADMAN
           Do you really want to know?
                         
          Eddie thinks. No, he doesn't.
                         
          EXT. CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS BUILDING - DAY
                         
          Eddie and Steadman exit, come down the steps, Eddie looking
          thrown. He drifts along, half-a-step behind Steadman, deep
          in thought.
                         
                          STEADMAN
           It's not so bad, is it?
                         
          Eddie doesn't answer.

                          STEADMAN (CONT'D)
           Doesn't every man on the path to
           greatness have to tolerate the wind-
           drag of compromise?
                         
          A black LIMO waits at the curb.
                         
                          STEADMAN (CONT'D)
           Overall, we'll all be better off...
           foreign policy, the courts, even
           the Constitution could stand a
           little tweaking...
                         
          They descend the last few steps. Steadman opens the limo
          door for Eddie...
                         
          But Eddie hesitates. Doesn't get in.
                         
                          STEADMAN (CONT'D)
           Eddie?
                         
                          EDDIE
           After you.
                         
                          STEADMAN
                          (CORDIAL)
           No, "Senator". You first.
                         
          Eddie gestures for him to get in.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Please.
                         
                          STEADMAN
           All right then...
                         
          He gets in. And Eddie CLOSES THE DOOR AFTER HIM. Stands
          outside the limo, looking back at Steadman through the rolled-
          down window, his face a cold mask.
                         
                          STEADMAN (CONT'D)
           Oh, now. Don't underestimate us.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Don't underestimate your own
           creation.
                         
          Steadman looks at him quizically.
                         
                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           I mean, you invented it. What does
           it do? It puts me 50 steps ahead
           of you fucks.

           You think I didn't spend my days on
           MDT devising a personal defense
           structure that would scare the shit
           out of the Israelis--? You think
           there's not people with a bead on
           you right now, right in this
           building? You think this
           conversation is private?
                         
                          STEADMAN
           You don't know the caliber of
           enemies you'll be making.
                         
                          EDDIE
           You want to push that button? I'll
           show you my silos if you show me
           yours.
                         
                          STEADMAN
           You'll run out. You'll die.
                         
                          EDDIE
           Or I'll think of something. Isn't
           that what MDT does? Makes you
           think of something? Might even
           tell me how to get off it.
                         
          A flicker in Steadman's eyes. Anger.
                         
                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           What if I just ask the drug... how
           to tell the drug... how to fuck
           itself? I mean, isn't it like the
           8-ball?
                         
          Steadman raises his hand to the driver and the limo pulls
          away.
                         
                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           It always answers.
                         
          As the limo recedes into the distance, Eddie finally exhales.
                         
          And only then do we see it.
                         
          He's scared.
                         
                          THE END
