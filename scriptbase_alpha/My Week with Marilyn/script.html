                                  Adrian Hodges




<b>          1 EXT. TILBURY DOCKS. DAY. 1
</b>
           Over a DARK SCREEN we see the caption:
           "This is a fairy story, an episode out of time and space,
           which nevertheless was real" - Colin Clark.
           Then, FADE UP ON:
           Newsreel footage of SIR LAURENCE OLIVIER AND VIVIEN LEIGH
           arriving back at Tilbury Docks to be greeted by an excited
           crowd of fans. As they progress down the gangplank and stop
           to sign autographs we HEAR an excited commentary OVER:

<b>                          COMMENTATOR
</b>           "Returning to England are
           Britain's acting royalty Sir
           Laurence Olivier and Lady
           Olivier, better known as stunning
           Gone With The Wind star Vivien
           Leigh. Sir Laurence has added a
           new string to his bow with the
           announcement that he is to direct
           and star in a screen version of
           Terence Rattigan's stage play The
           Sleeping Prince with none other
           than Hollywood siren Marilyn
           Monroe. When the world's greatest
           actor romances the most famous
           woman alive, we can be sure that
           sparks will fly. Now, now Lady
           Olivier, don't worry - any
           romance is strictly for the
           camera!"
           As OLIVIER and VIVIEN smile for the photographers, we -

<b>          2 EXT. SALTWOOD CASTLE. DAY. 2
</b>
           It is 1956. Saltwood Castle, the family home of the Clark
           family, looms over the landscape, framed by the setting
           sun. It is majestic, an Englishman's dream of a home,
           complete with turrets and even a moat. There is a feeling
           of timeless beauty and stability about the scene, something
           profoundly English.
           We are a very long way from Hollywood.

<b>          3 EXT. SALTWOOD CASTLE. GARDEN. DAY. 3
</b>
           COLIN CLARK, 23, hurries across the lawn carrying a bag, he
           is casually dressed, boyish and handsome. He heads towards a
           beautiful, ramshackle building and through the ancient oak
           doors.

<b>           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 2.
</b>
                         

<b>          3A INT. SALTWOOD CASTLE. LIBRARY STAIRS. DAY. 3A
</b>
           COLIN bounds up the stairs into the Library.

                         

<b>          3B INT. SALTWOOD CASTLE. LIBRARY. DAY. 3B
</b>
           As COLIN enters, he sees SIR KENNETH CLARK, standing in front
           of a painting on an easel by the Italian Baroque painter,
           Annibale Carracci. He has two STUDENTS with him, a man and a
           woman in their early 20s, and is in mid-description of the
           painting.

<b>                          KENNETH
</b>           ... and this is one of Carracci's
           earlier works and one is able to
           see the emergence of his now famous
           Baroque style, which is clearly
           rooted in the tradition of high
           renaissance and antiquity...
           COLIN pauses briefly and hurries towards them. Throughout the
           scene there is a sense of his urgency and desire to go. The
           whole thing should be played at breakneck pace. KENNETH beams
           affectionately.

<b>                          KENNETH
</b>           Colin! Come in. Have you met James
           and Anna? Two very brilliant
           pupils.
           He has the avuncular air of a benign academic, affable and a
           little eccentric. COLIN smiles hurriedly at the students, no
           time to waste.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           I'm leaving for London now, Pa.

<b>                          KENNETH
</b>           Ah, yes. Well, bon chance, dear
           boy...
           He puts a friendly arm around COLIN's shoulder and starts to
           walk him back to the door.

<b>                          KENNETH
</b>           I can always get you a research
           position at the V&amp;A when you've
           grown up a bit and got this film
           idea out of your system...
           COLIN's smiles but before he can reply JANE CLARK whirls into
           the room, a ball of energy, talking nineteen to the dozen.

<b>                          JANE
</b>           Kenneth, you might have told Cook
           we were another two for dinner.
           What is everyone supposed to eat?
           Cabbage soup? Oh, Colin, darling,
           there you are...

<b>           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 2A.
</b>
                         
           She looks wonderful in a good quality but elderly dress,
           eccentrically combined with gardening attire, her mind on a
           dozen things at once.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           I'm off now, Mama.

<b>                          JANE
</b>           Off?

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           My job interview, remember..?
           But she is already continuing her journey. COLIN smiles
           hurriedly at KENNETH, who gives him an affectionate wave as
           COLIN dashes after his mother. She leaves the Library.

<b>                          CUT TO:
</b>
                         

<b>          3C INT. SALTWOOD CASTLE. GARDEN. DAY. 3C
</b>
           JANE strides across the lawn with COLIN rushing to catch up.

<b>                          JANE
</b>           Can't you stay for dinner? There's
           nothing to eat but I'm sure the
           conversation will be charming.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           I don't want to be late in the
           morning.
           As COLIN hurries after JANE he is nearly run down by an
           elderly GARDENER with a lawn mower, and has to take lightning
           evasive action. JANE doesn't notice.

<b>                          JANE
</b>           I'm sure they won't mind. You'll be
           a famous film director in no time.
           I know your father's put in a word.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           I wish he hadn't done that. I can
           manage on my own.
           She stops so abruptly he nearly slams into her. JANE looks
           around the garden with a frown.

<b>                          JANE
</b>           I have to watch Jenkins like a
           hawk. One more of his murderous
           prunings and we'll lose the tea
           roses for ever.
           And she's off again, with COLIN still following. He can't
           help smiling at the madness of it all.

<b>          4 EXT. SALTWOOD CASTLE. DRIVEWAY. DAY. 4
</b>
           The sun is setting, casting a golden glow over the castle.
           COLIN and JANE emerge from the front door, COLIN pauses in
           the driveway and dumps his bag in the back of his old but
           racy MG Sports car. Only now does JANE really turn her
           attention fully to him for the first time.

<b>                          JANE
</b>           Now go and have a lovely time,
           darling. We're always here when
           you're ready to talk your future.
           COLIN wants to protest but before he can get the words out
           JANE sees a YOUNG GARDENER walking at the side of the house
           with a wheel barrow. Her face lights up.

<b>                          JANE
</b>           Mullins! Be an angel - find Cook
           and ask her how many pork chops we
           need for tonight. Then bring the
           car round. I must get to the
           village before the shop shuts...
           She dashes away after the GARDENER, turning back as an
           afterthought to blow a kiss at COLIN as she goes.
           COLIN smiles, then pauses for a moment to look at the house.
           We can sense both his affection for it but more pressingly
           his need to get away.
           He gets in, puts the car in gear and the Bristol pulls out of
           the drive and across the moat. In the last rays of the sun,
           the countryside looks magical, but Colin only has eyes for
           the road ahead.

           A sharp contrast with the hazy beauty of the countryside.
           It is early morning in the heart of London's West End. The
           streets hum with activity as OFFICE WORKERS in hats and
           raincoats stream from the tube stations.
           COLIN pushes his way through the early morning crowds in
           Piccadilly. This is his patch; he is very much at home
           here, negotiating the busy streets with ease. As he passes
           by the upmarket Burlington Arcade a TAILOR pauses in
           measuring a suit for a client to give him a familiar wave.
           COLIN waves back.

           Checking his watch he runs the last few yards then stops
           outside the imposing facade of 144 Piccadilly. A plaque
           outside the door announces: LAURENCE OLIVIER PRODUCTIONS.
           Colin fingers his carefully knotted tie to make sure
           everything is correctly in place, then goes to the door and
           rings the bell.

           The reception area is luxurious - deep pile carpets and
           plush sofas. VANESSA, the beautiful secretary, sits behind
           her imposing desk, gazing doubtfully at COLIN.

           hear a man answer in an office down the hall, his voice
           carrying irritably.

           executive. He is tall and gloomy, with black-rimmed

           as he stuffs his pipe with tobacco.

           PERCEVAL gives him a grim stare as he goes through to his

           eye optimistically but she ignores him.

           A new morning. COLIN perches restlessly on the sofa.
           Despite his modest triumph he is back where he started. The
           seconds pass in dull silence. He is beginning to think his
           campaign will fail. But then, in a heartbeat, everything
           changes.
           He looks up in surprise as the door bursts open and SIR
           LAURENCE OLIVIER strides in with his wife VIVIEN LEIGH on
           his arm.

<b>           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 10.

          At the age of 49 SIR LAURENCE OLIVIER is at the peak of his
          fame. He is handsome and charismatic, and VIVIEN is
          scarcely less extraordinary. The Gone With The Wind star
          remains classically lovely, flirtatious and captivating.
          Individually they are charismatic enough, but together they
          are electrifying, seeming to charge the air around them
          with the power of their personalities, galvanising anyone
          who comes into contact with them.
          VANESSA leaps to her feet and PERCEVAL hurries to greet
          them as COLIN stands up uncertainly. OLIVIER is all amiable
          bluster and bonhomie.

<b>                          OLIVIER
</b>           Do you know, Hughie, it is simply

           great beauty has its way...
          He laughs, but then notices VIVIEN's less than enthusiastic
          response. Seeking refuge in some distraction he notices
          COLIN hovering by the sofa.

<b>                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
</b>           Hello, boy... remind me?
          He smiles vaguely and glances at VIVIEN for help.

<b>                          VIVIEN
</b>           You remember Colin, darling. You
           met him at the Clarks' party.

<b>                          (NO IDEA)
</b>           Of course. What are you doing

</b>           You said there might be a job on
           your film.
          OLIVIER has no recollection of this and fumbles in his
          pockets to cover his confusion, bringing out a packet of
          cigarettes and offering them to COLIN with breezy charm.

<b>                          OLIVIER
</b>           Have a cigarette. Keep the pack.
          He turns quickly to PERCEVAL.

           in?
          He puts an arm around PERCEVAL's shoulders and they
          disappear together into Perceval's office.
          VIVIEN lingers behind, smiling radiantly at COLIN who looks
          dumbly at the packet of cigarettes in his hand. He now sees
          they are called "Oliviers". VIVIEN wrinkles her nose in
          amusement.

           I'm afraid they're rather

          She cups Colin's cheeks with her hands and studies him in
          mock awe.

</b>           I suppose he's all right.
          VIVIEN's eyes sparkle. OLIVIER emerges from the office with a
          handful of script pages and VIVIEN looks at him slyly,
          getting her own back for his tactless over-praise of
          Marilyn's charms as she strokes COLIN's cheek.

           tray with tea and a plate of biscuits. The blinds are closed
           and a 16mm projector is running; silent images play on a fold-
           up screen in the corner of the room.
           Framed in the light of the projector are PERCEVAL and the
           film's lighting cameraman JACK CARDIFF. They take no notice
           of Colin.
           He looks up at the screen. The two men are watching make-up,
           hair and wardrobe tests for the film. MARILYN MONROE in
           character as Elsie Marina.

           The film shows Marilyn looking sweet and pretty, chatting
           silently to someone just off camera, mugging playfully in
           costume, larking about with her hair - and then, when she
           wants to, turning on her full film star wattage and looking
           wonderful, every inch the beautiful icon.
           It is an intimate glimpse of her at work. Colin watches,
           fascinated, completely forgetting why he's there, still
           holding the tray -

</b>           How the hell do you tone down
           Marilyn Monroe?!
           COLIN laughs. He immediately regrets it. Both men turn to
           look at him. PERCEVAL turns off the projector and gazes at
           him stonily.

           COLIN had forgotten the tray. He blushes furiously, puts it

           around its circumference. He taps his pencil thoughtfully
           as he lights a cigarette - one of the branded pack that
           Olivier gave him. He inhales deeply, thinking, then
           grimaces in distaste, quickly stubbing it out under his
           foot.

           He winds down his window and simply throws the whole lot

           behind the speeding car, landing in the pretty hedgerows
           and on neat front lawns.

</b>           Well, that was quieter than some.
           Vivien smiles at the wry joke. ARTHUR JACOBS watches the
           proceedings with an eagle eye.

</b>           Okay, let's get a snap of the

           not a firing squad.
           As the group breaks up, MILTON GREENE, handsome and dark-
           haired, now approaches OLIVIER and COLIN.

<b>                          MILTON
</b>           This is some place you found.
           He glances at the house. Olivier smiles generously.

</b>           You have my new assistant Colin
           to thank for that. (Pause, he
           shepherds COLIN over) This is
           Milton Greene. You must be very
           nice to him. He owns half of

           GREENE (34) offers them a tired smile.
           OLIVIER produces one of his branded packets and offers a
           cigarette to Milton.

          If he notices the "Olivier" name he doesn't show it.

           MILLER and MARILYN are now being photographed on their own.
           ROGER moves over to JACOBS and murmurs discreetly in his

           COLIN notices Marilyn grip Miller's hand tightly as the

           surprised to find VIVIEN at his elbow.

</b>           Oh, don't be such a boy!

           The Dog and Duck is a rundown pub in an out of the way lane
           near the studios. It is a rough, local place utterly devoid

           A few hard-core LOCALS stand nursing their pints at the bar.
           One is idly throwing darts. The wallpaper is faded yellow
           with cigarette smoke, stale sandwiches curl in a display
           case. COLIN looks around, his heart sinking. BARRY, the
           landlord looks him up and down, disparagingly.

</b>           Colin Clark. I booked a room.
           BARRY takes a dusty ledger from beneath the bar, spins it
           around for COLIN to sign.

          COLIN can't help looking a little pleased with himself.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           I'm here working on a film.
          The LOCALS look up from their pints, unimpressed.

<b>                          BARRY
</b>           What film's that?

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           It's called `The Sleeping Prince'.
          The darts player, ANDY, doesn't turn. His aim remains
          steady.

<b>                          ANDY
</b>           Sounds lousy.

</b>           Can't be bothered.
          COLIN tries to impress.

<b>                          BARRY
</b>           Oh, will you now?
          The regulars grin unkindly into their pints. ANDY doesn't
          look away from his game, as he offers laconically:

<b>                          ANDY
</b>           The Queen and Prince Philip popped
           in for a pint earlier. Pity, you
           just missed them.
          There are supportive snorts of derision from the LOCALS.
          COLIN takes it on the chin. BARRY hands him a key.

<b>                          BARRY
</b>           The room's three quid a week, first
           week in advance. You're in number
           two.
          COLIN takes the key and his bag, just as BARRY adds, with
          perfect deadpan timing:

           COLIN stands aghast. He is staying in a grim little room
           above the noisy saloon bar. The wallpaper is peeling, the
           furniture is ancient and the whole place reeks of damp.
           Dirty net curtains flutter in the window. He puts his bag
           on the bed and sits down. The mattress sags pitifully. He
           looks down and finds a stained and yellowing chamber pot
           under the bed. He slides it back with a look of revulsion.

           The principal cast of The Sleeping Prince, as it was still
           known at the time, assemble on the sound stage amongst the
           half-finished set. They chat and smoke, their scripts in
           their hands. OLIVIER stands in their midst, very much first
           amongst equals. One chair sits conspicuously unoccupied.
           DAME SYBIL THORNDIKE (74), severe-looking but kindly, very
           much the grand dame of the gathering, smiles cheerfully.
           RICHARD WATTIS leans over to her with a cheerful grin.

           COLIN hurries along the corridor and stops outside

           The door opens sharply and a small, bohemian looking woman
           in her 50s stands staring at him. This is PAULA STRASBERG.

           he makes his opening speech of welcome.

<b>                          OLIVIER

           around) We may seem a little

           first, but I hope that in time
           you may come to find your method
           in our madness.
           Pleased with his over-contrived rhetorical flourish, he
           gives Paula a pointed look. She glowers back, obscurely
           sensing that she has been insulted in some way. MARILYN
           also looks up in confusion at Olivier's well intentioned
           but clumsy joke.
           Oblivious to her reaction, he opens his script with a
           sentimental flourish.

           He is momentarily close to tears. WATTIS rolls his eyes
           discreetly, earning a grin from the actor PAUL HARDWICK.
           There is a rustle of pages and a few coughs, a mood of
           eager nervousness in the air as they all prepare for the

           OLIVIER tries to continue but is yet again brought up short
           by PAULA's passionate whispering.

<b>                          PAULA

           First light over Pinewood Studios. Although it is August it
           is chilly so early in the morning. COLIN stands by the gate
           wearing only his thin summer jacket. He blows on his hands
           to keep warm. A black car appears. The window winds down
           and DAME SYBIL THORNDIKE pops her head out.

<b>                          SYBIL THORNDIKE
</b>           How kind of you to meet us. Dear

</b>           Oh, to be young again!
           She blows him a kiss and the car rolls in through the gate.
           Almost immediately OLIVIER's chauffeur driven Bentley

           under the pressure of enthusiastic love-making.
           The phone rings. MILTON nods to COLIN to pick it up. COLIN
           is glad of the distraction. We hear ORTON's irate tones on

           The door finally opens and MARILYN emerges, with PAULA on
           one side and MILTON on the other. In her figure-hugging
           shimmering white sheath of a dress she is ravishingly
           beautiful. Her hair is like a halo of light around her
           head. No one can take their eyes off her. Slowly, all work
           on the set stops. MARILYN walks to the set, acutely aware
           of the scrutiny of the crew.
           She smiles nervously, then suddenly hesitates, feeling the
           weight of everyone's attention. Anxiety flits across her
           face.
           She whispers something to PAULA and bolts back towards her
           dressing room. OLIVIER stares after her in shock.

</b>           I'm sure we're all good union

           He's not in the union. (Pause, to
           Colin) Put the chair down.

          COLIN drops it as though it was on fire. It clatters to the

           fall out, it's only management
           that benefits.

           MARILYN and PAULA are heading for the dressing room.
           MARILYN looks tired and disconnected. COLIN is just behind
           them on another errand. He can't help overhearing Paula's
           insistent, honeyed tones as she responds to Marilyn's
           uncertainty.

<b>                          MARILYN

           She stops abruptly and gets down on her knees in the
           corridor in front of Marilyn. COLIN stops awkwardly, his
           path blocked.

<b>                          PAULA (CONT'D)

</b>           Oh, okay. I guess I was.

           The mood in the Club is cosmopolitan, lively but elegant.
           Rows of small tables are arranged around the stage, a few
           young couples are dancing to a jazz trio playing an
           exuberant, upbeat number. The music comes to an end and
           the couples return to their tables, COLIN and LUCY among

           both a glass.

<b>                          LUCY
</b>           You're not the average third, are
           you? Most of them would be happy

           COLIN touches Lucy's breasts and then opens the buttons of

          She gives Colin a swift peck on the cheek as she tidies
          herself. A moment later the door opens and Lucy's father, MR.
          ARMSTRONG comes in, wearing his dressing gown over pyjamas.
          He glances at COLIN with a suspicious smile as he looks at
          his daughter.

          Lost for words they stare at each other for another moment

          him with a smile at COLIN. He grins and whispers.

           As he walks down the path, COLIN pauses. He looks around at
           the uniform semi-detached houses all around him. He is
           uncomfortable here, so far from the glamorous world of his
           parents or Pinewood studios. He has a strong sense that he
           and Lucy are from very different worlds, and walks to his car
           with an uneasy sense of relief to be getting away.

           COLIN is back on the early morning watch. A black car draws
           up and SYBIL THORNDIKE leans out.

</b>           Colin, dear, I thought you looked
           cold so I bought you this.
           She hands him a bright red woollen scarf. COLIN is touched.

</b>           Thank you, Dame Sybil.

           his neck and looks up and down the road again.

           The crew stand around in sullen discontent. OLIVIER paces
           back and forth with MILTON at his side.

           OLIVIER scowls at COLIN, who gives him a cigarette. MARILYN
           finally emerges with PAULA at her elbow. OLIVIER advances
           on her, his anger simmering.

<b>                          OLIVIER
</b>           Marilyn, darling you are an
           angel, and I kiss the hem of your
           garment, but why can't you get
           here on time for the love of

</b>           Oh... you have that word in
           England too?
           She looks at him in surprise. She looks sedated, not quite
           there. PAULA leaps protectively to her defence.

<b>                          PAULA

           She has to find in herself all

           Acting isn't just a case of
           putting on a costume or some
           ludicrous false nose.
           OLIVIER gives her a freezing look then takes Marilyn's
           hand, leading her forward like a child.

           older woman's words sink in.

           This poor girl hasn't had your
           years of experience. She is in a

           part. Now, are you helping or
           bullying?

           looks on, startled.

</b>
           OLIVIER, MILTON, PERCEVAL, ORTON and the editor JACK HARRIS
           watch rushes. COLIN lurks about unnoticed at the back. They
           watch one of OLIVIER's speeches (from the " The Coconut
           Girl" sequence we saw filming in Scenes 61 and 62). He is
           dry and clipped, every take precise and professional. It is
           an effective but theatrical performance.
           MARILYN sneaks in with ARTHUR MILLER. They sit in the back
           row watching her performance from the same scene. She
           fluffs take after take, gets her words wrong and pauses,
           looking dazed. COLIN notices her clutching MILLER's hand
           tightly. But finally a good take comes up. She is charming
           and natural and her performance suddenly makes OLIVIER's
           look stiff and clumsy. MILLER smiles in relief and
           reassurance.

<b>                          MILLER
</b>           That one's pretty damn good. You
           knocked it out of the park.
           MARILYN glows at his praise.

<b>                          MILTON
</b>           When Marilyn gets it right you
           just don't want to look at anyone
           else.
           OLIVIER frowns. For all his greatness as an actor he will
           never be a film star like the maddeningly instinctive
           Marilyn. And the injustice of it is like a stab through his
           heart.
           At the back COLIN only has eyes for the screen. He watches
           MARILYN's image, enthralled. Until now he has taken Marilyn
           entirely at Olivier's valuation, but as he watches her on
           screen he begins to see things differently.

           He sneaks a look at her in real life. She is holding
           MILLER's hand tightly, looking tense and vulnerable as one
           disastrous take follows another.

           rushes. Besides, she's an

           Clothes are strewn carelessly all over the floor. There are
           pill bottles, full and empty, on every surface, along with
           empty bottles of champagne and bunches of flowers. COLIN
           rummages around on the table, moving piles of scripts and
           books. No luck. He walks casually through the half-open
           door into the inner chamber.
           And stops dead in his tracks.
           MARILYN stands by a chair, a towel wrapped around her head.
           She is completely naked.
           She looks at him in astonishment.
           He stares back, equally astounded.
           He sees her script, heavily covered in handwritten notes,
           lying on the table next to an open bottle of champagne and
           a bottle of pills.

          He looks around anxiously. But then a PASSER-BY suddenly
          narrows his eyes and takes a second look. His face lights
          up and he shouts -

          MARILYN gives him a radiant smile and within seconds is
          surrounded by a crowd of SHOPPERS alerted by the fuss. A
          feverish excitement grows out of nothing as people come
          running to look, pushing and shoving to see.
          MARILYN is quickly hemmed in by the heaving mob. To begin
          with she enjoys it, smiling and posing happily for the
          cameras that appear out of nowhere. But as the crowd press
          towards something in the mood of the gathering changes; it
          becomes wild and over-excited mood as people scream
          Marilyn's name and shove bits of paper to sign in her face.
          A WOMAN is pushed to the ground and MARILYN is forced back
          against the shop window. COLIN sees a flicker of panic on
          her face.

          COLIN and ROGER hurl themselves into the crowd doing what
          they can to keep the excited fans at bay.
          They manage to force a path to the car, drag the door open
          and bundle MARILYN and MILLER into the back. MARILYN is
          pinned against the door and COLIN has to put his arm around
          her shoulders as he helps her in. He hurls himself into the

          in beside Marilyn.

           RICHARD WATTIS, in character as Elsie Marina and
           Northbrook, open the doors of the Grand Duke's drawing
           room.

           charming.

           matters. Let's go straight away.
           MARILYN smiles vaguely. HAIR and MAKE-UP rush to do last
           minute checks.

          MILTON intervenes.

           great performance. You should
           give her as long as it takes.

</b>           Eight months of this? I'd rather
           kill myself.
          Throughout all this MARILYN herself looks lost. COLIN
          watches her as she feels the crew's irritable collective
          gaze. Flustered, she flutters her hands in a calming
          gesture, then goes to the side of the set to lean on a bar
          put there for her to rest on (her costume is too tight to
          allow her to sit down). PAULA accompanies her. MARILYN
          looks up at her in anguish.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           I can't do this. I can't.
          PAULA looks at her adamantly.

</b>           You can do it. You can't fail.

           suffer more but you will create.

          MARILYN looks at her, desperately wanting to believe it.

</b>           Remember, Marilyn, a tree is

          MARILYN listens intently, a frown flitting across her face.

           The clapperboard snaps one final time. Take twenty three.
           MARILYN's smile is a grimace of terror. COLIN can hardly
           bear to look. Everyone holds their breath.

<b>           MARILYN (AS ELSIE)

           all right too, isn't it?"
           There is a stunned moment. WATTIS gapes and MARILYN looks
           around uncertainly. Did she say it? OLIVIER gestures
           frantically from behind the camera that she should carry
           on. She hesitates...
           ... there is an agonising beat...
           ... and then she panics and bolts for the side of the set.

           He takes her arm and whisks her away to the side of the
           set, lowering his voice, trying to conceal his exasperation
           with a honeyed tone.

           act?
          OLIVIER is bewildered by her inability to appreciate her
          own natural talent - as he sees it. He looks at her in
          genuine anguish.

<b>                          OLIVIER
</b>           Marilyn, you are the most

          MARILYN flinches as though slapped. Tension ripples through
          the set. COLIN watches in dismay.

<b>                          MARILYN

           off the set with PAULA following. The atmosphere is awful.

<b>           DAY.
</b>           OLIVIER sits brooding savagely in front of his make-up
           mirror with MILTON GREENE. COLIN unobtrusively fetches
           whisky and cigarettes for them both as OLIVIER abruptly
           booms out to himself.

<b>                          OLIVIER
</b>           "O, now, for ever Farewell the

           virtue O, farewell/Farewell..."
           (Pause, exasperated) Paula's not
           an actress. She not a director,
           not a teacher. Her only talent is
           buttering up Marilyn.

<b>                          MILTON
</b>           It would be worse if she wasn't
           around.

<b>                          OLIVIER
</b>           You know what would make Marilyn
           Monroe a real actor? A season in
           rep. They wouldn't stand for this
           kind of nonsense at the
           Hippodrome in Eastbourne.

<b>                          MILTON
</b>           You have to be patient with her.

<b>                          OLIVIER
</b>           Trying to teach Marilyn how to
           act is like teaching Urdu to a
           badger.
           MILTON gives him a look but says nothing. Instead he picks
           up his bag and opens it. It is stuffed with bottles of
           pills. He takes one of them, checks the label and puts it
           in his pocket.

<b>                          MILTON
</b>           I better go see her. She'll need
           something to help her calm down.
           COLIN holds the door for him as he goes out.

<b>                          OLIVIER
</b>           (After a second)
           Pills to sleep, pills to wake up.
           Pills to calm her down, pills to

<b>                          OLIVIER

           in darkness. COLIN inches forward uncertainly.
           He stops, waiting for his eyes to adjust. The house is
           totally silent. Then, just as he is about to move, he hears
           something.
           Breathing, very close by. Faint but unmistakable. Shallow
           breaths, like sighs.
           COLIN is paralysed.
           A beat, then -
           A door is flung open along the hall and light floods into
           the corridor.
           MARILYN is sitting on the carpet leaning against the wall
           only a few feet away from Colin. She is wrapped in a pink
           bed-cover and stares directly at him, her expression blank
           and sedated. By her side is an open spiral bound notebook,
           its pages closely crammed with handwriting.

           She stares at COLIN. It is not even clear she knows he is
           there. COLIN gazes back at her, paralysed. MILLER's voice
           comes again, flat and tired.

           and let's get some sleep.
           Finally MARILYN stirs and closes the notebook. Holding it
           to her breast and clutching the cover around her shoulders
           she gets up and goes into the bedroom, closing the door.
           As the light snaps off COLIN breathes for the first time in
           what feels like minutes.

           suspiciously, sees it is Colin and turns back into the
           room.

           PAULA settles down in the corner. MARILYN lies on a sofa,
           wearing a bathrobe, her face in shadow. Pill bottles are
           scattered across the dresser at her elbow. There is a long
           pause. She sighs softly.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           How old are you?

           She turns her head and her beautiful face comes fully into
           the light.

           COLIN hesitates. It seems pointless to deny it.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           He was worried about you.

<b>                          MARILYN

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           No! Of course not. Why would
           anyone spy on you?
           She sighs, and looks away.

<b>                          COLIN (CONT'D)
</b>           Are you all right, Miss Monroe?
           He waits hesitantly, but she seems to have drifted off. But
           then, suddenly, she turns back to him, her eyes huge.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           Colin? Whose side are you on?
           COLIN stares at her. She looks utterly beautiful and
           vulnerable in the shadowy light. There is only one answer
           anyone could give.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           Yours, Miss Monroe.
           She rewards him with a brilliant smile, her whole face
           lighting up.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           Call me Marilyn.
           He is suddenly overwhelmed by a rush of sympathy. She looks
           so lost and vulnerable. Perhaps he means it. Perhaps he is
           on her side now.

           As COLIN walks down through the studio he meets RICHARD
           WATTIS with PAUL HARDWICK, on their way to wardrobe. WATTIS

           MARILYN is finally back on the set, filming a solo dance
           routine. Released from the need to remember any words she
           takes refuge in the physical activity, undulating sexily in
           her tight white dress in a performance which is gawky,
           mildly silly and charming all at the same time.
           The dance is deliberately a little amateurish. Elsie Marina
           isn't meant to be any sort of superstar. But she radiates
           joy and innocence and sheer happiness in the dance, and
           MARILYN captures all this perfectly. Within the scene the
           actor JEREMY SPENSER, playing Nicky, watches from the
           doorway.
           Everyone watches silently from behind the camera. No one
           can look away, least of all COLIN. It feels like one purely
           joyful moment in the agony the film has become, and Marilyn
           is radiant. Even OLIVIER has a reluctant half-smile on his
           face as he watches.

           The stage is empty except for OLIVIER and MILLER. They sit
           in a pool of light in the cavernous room. COLIN pours
           whisky for them and then steps back into the shadows. Both
           men ignore him. He is too unimportant to worry about.
           MILLER leans forward, holding his pipe but not smoking it.

<b>                          MILLER
</b>           I dreamed last night I could hear
           singing. And then I realised it
           wasn't a dream. There was a male
           voice choir serenading Marilyn
           under our window. At two in the
           morning. It's a circus. A freak

<b>                          MILLER (CONT'D)
</b>           She thought I could smash all her
           insecurities with one magical
           stroke. That I could make her a
           new person.
          He pauses for a second, weighing every word carefully.

<b>                          MILLER (CONT'D)
</b>           She wants me to protect her but I
           can't. I can't even protect
           myself. (Pause) She read some
           notes I made. They were nothing.
           Just a few ideas.

<b>                          OLIVIER
</b>           About her?
          He looks up and nods slowly.

<b>                          MILLER
</b>           She took them the wrong way.
          He leaves a long, uneasy pause.

<b>                          OLIVIER
</b>           But you do love her? Your new

          MILLER plays with his whisky.

</b>           I can't work. I can't think.

           everyone, from the lowest chippie to the Heads of
           Department with the same flirtatious grace. OLIVIER walks
           at her elbow. The crew crowd around her. She is easy and
           relaxed, relishing every second of their attention.

           Tough as he is, he melts visibly. She moves on to JACK
           CARDIFF, the lighting cameraman, looking at him in mock
           misery.

<b>                          VIVIEN

           VIVIEN glances away to see MARILYN standing nearby, awkward
           and excluded. She has come straight from make-up and wears
           only a towelling robe, slippers and curlers in her hair.

</b>           But I'm too old to play her in

           about that. You see, the truth is
           all that matters to him. That's
           why we all admire him so very
           much.
           She glances at OLIVIER with a fluttering laugh. He smiles
           back with a haunted look in his eyes.

           Goodbye, everyone!
           The crew press around her. MARILYN watches, feeling more
           than ever the odd one out. COLIN watches her from the edge
           of the crowd. She cuts a lonely, vulnerable figure. He is
           totally preoccupied with her, so much so that when VIVIEN
           comes up behind him he turns guiltily as though caught out.
           VIVIEN stares at him. All her exuberance has vanished and
           she looks suddenly tired and older. It as though the facade
           of a beautiful building is beginning to crack. She gazes at
           him with bitter disappointment.

<b>                          VIVIEN (CONT'D)
</b>           Oh, Colin. Not you too.
           He wants to protest but VIVIEN is already turning away.

<b>           BOOTH. DAY.
</b>           COLIN pushes open the door to the projection booth. The
           screen is lit up with the rushes of the scene in The Prince
           And The Showgirl where a startlingly beautiful MARILYN, in
           gorgeous close-up, eats caviar and drinks champagne in a
           toast to the American President.

          OLIVIER and VIVIEN stand in the shadows of the projector
          beam. COLIN freezes in the doorway to the projection booth
          holding a pile of film cans. VIVIEN is crying abjectly.

<b>                          VIVIEN
</b>           I didn't think she would be so
           beautiful. She... shines on that
           screen.

<b>                          OLIVIER
</b>           You shouldn't upset yourself. You
           are ten times the actress she
           will ever be.

<b>                          VIVIEN
</b>           If you could see yourself. The
           way you watch her...

<b>                          OLIVIER
</b>           There's never been anything
           between Marilyn and me.
          She laughs hysterically.

<b>                          VIVIEN
</b>           Only because she didn't want you.

<b>                          OLIVIER
</b>           You're imagining things.

<b>                          VIVIEN
</b>           Do you think I'm a fool? You
           didn't think the little tart
           could resist the great Laurence
           Olivier.
          She looks at him venomously, a dangerous, unbalanced hatred
          seething in her expression.
           VIVIEN (CONT'D) (cont'd)
           But she saw through you, didn't she
           darling? Take away the actor and
           what's left of the man? You can't
           even play the husband properly
           without a script.
           (slaps him hard across the
           face. )
           I hope she makes your life hell!

<b>                          OLIVIER

          She storms out. After a beat, COLIN tentatively enters.
          OLIVIER looks at COLIN in muted apology.

<b>                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
</b>           She hasn't been well. There was a
           baby... she... we... lost it...
           COLIN looks down awkwardly. OLIVIER sighs.

<b>                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
</b>           (After a pause)
           Do you have a cigarette, Colin?
           COLIN hurries to offer him one of his "Oliviers". OLIVIER
           grimaces wryly.

<b>                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
</b>           Not one of those awful things.
           COLIN finds a woodbine in his other pocket and gives it to
           OLIVIER, who lights it with a shaking hand. He inhales
           deeply.

<b>                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
</b>           Vivien's right... I did think I
           would fall shatteringly in love
           with Marilyn. What a joke.
           He looks at COLIN, his feelings raw and exposed.

           The set is dressed and the crew are waiting but once again
           there is no sign of Marilyn. The actors, RICHARD WATTIS and
           PAUL HARDWICK amongst them, sit apathetically in full
           costume, while ORTON stands with his arms folded.
           Technicians chat or sit idly. As COLIN watches, OLIVIER

          The phone rings. OLIVIER picks with a sudden burst of
          optimism.

<b>                          OLIVIER

</b>           Yes, he's here. (Pause) It's for
           you.
          Puzzled, COLIN takes the phone as OLIVIER stares at him.

           He shrugs awkwardly. MILTON looks at OLIVIER in panic.

<b>                          MILTON
</b>           He shouldn't be talking to her.
           He's just a kid. Supposing he
           says something? (Pause) Why the
           hell didn't she call me?
           His angry - and jealous - frustration is in stark contrast
           to OLIVIER, who looks at COLIN with a new interest,
           wondering if there is anything in this odd situation that
           can work to his advantage. He smiles calmly.

<b>                          OLIVIER

</b>           Miss Monroe said for you to wait.
           She won't be long.
           He looks at COLIN dubiously as he goes out. COLIN is
           nervous and not quite sure what to do with himself. He
           looks at the drinks in their decanters on the sideboard and
           is suddenly desperate for some Dutch courage. He finds the
           brandy and picks it up -

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>
<b>                          (OFF)
</b>           Help yourself to a drink.
           COLIN wheels in surprise. MARILYN stands in the doorway,
           casually but beautifully dressed in silk trousers and a
           pale cream shirt. COLIN looks guiltily at the brandy.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           I was just... checking you've got
           everything you need.
           She walks to the sideboard, standing only a few inches away
           from him. He can't take his eyes from hers. He drops his
           gaze, only to find himself staring at her breasts. He looks
           up again sharply but not before she notices. She takes the
           decanter from his hand.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           Here, let me.
           She pours some brandy into a glass and gives it to him.

</b>           Are you frightened of me, Colin?

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           Good. Because I like you.
          Colin doesn't know what to say. MARILYN gazes at him.

<b>                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
</b>           I want you to help me. Will you
           do that?
          She looks at him, her eyes wide. COLIN feels himself
          sinking into her gaze.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           I'm only the third. Just a
           messenger, really.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           But you know what's going on. You
           can see both sides of the
           situation.
          He shrugs in helpless agreement.

<b>                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
</b>           I want you to be honest. Tell me
           everything.
          She indicates a chair and COLIN perches on it awkwardly.

<b>                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
</b>           Relax. I thought you weren't
           scared of me. (Pause) Are you
           hungry? I'll have them send in a
           tray. I'm starved.
          He doesn't know how to reply and Marilyn misreads his
          silence. Her eyes widen in dismay.

<b>                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
</b>           Oh, gee, I'm sorry. Am I

           have a Mrs. Colin waiting for you
           at home?

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           There's no Mrs. Colin.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           So we can talk as long as we
           like?
          He nods uncertainly. She frowns.

<b>                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
</b>           Why is Sir Olivier so mean?
           He talks to me as if he's

          COLIN hesitates then decides to throw caution to the wind.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           I'll tell you what's wrong. It's
           agony for him because he's a
           great actor who wants to be a
           film star, and agony for you
           because you're a film star who
           wants to be a great actress. And
           this film won't help either of
           you.
          He stops, breathless, knowing he has gone to far. She
          stares at him, wide-eyed with surprise. Horribly self-
          conscious he takes a too large swig of his brandy, reddens
          and coughs. She laughs.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           Are you sure you can handle that?
           You don't look old enough to
           drink.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           I'm 23, Miss Monroe.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           It's Marilyn. (Pause) I'm 30. I
           guess that makes me an old lady
           to you.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           Seven years is nothing.
          She smiles then sits opposite him.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           Do you know I've been married
           three times already? How did that
           happen?

<b>                          COLIN

          She smiles wistfully. Her presence is overwhelming. The
          silence stretches for a second, pregnant with strange
          possibilities. Suddenly the phone rings, making him jump.
          Automatically he picks it up.

           He looks at MARILYN's voluptuous figure. MARILYN looks back
           innocently and mouths the word "packages". She giggles. He
           turns crimson with the effort of trying to suppress his own
           laughter but MARILYN isn't helping. She teasingly makes
           shapes in the air of just how large the packages might be.
           He covers the phone, agonised, before they both collapse in
           irrepressible laughter. COLIN finally pulls himself
           together.

           MILTON stares at the phone in disbelief.

<b>                          MILTON

           COLIN looks at MARILYN but she shakes her head between
           giggles. He turns back to the phone, barely able to get the
           words out between snorts of laughter.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           I'm sorry, Milton. I have to go.
           He hangs up quickly. They both laugh helplessly. MARILYN
           smiles.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           Let's walk in the garden. See if
           we can find any more reporters in
           the bushes.
           She giggles. COLIN's heart contracts as she casually takes
           his arm.

                         

<b>          104 EXT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. GARDEN. DAY/DUSK. 104
</b>
           There is a golden glow on the horizon as the sun sinks.
           MARILYN, a cardigan around her shoulders, walks along the
           path. COLIN is at her side, acutely aware of her physical
           closeness.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           I didn't know it was so pretty
           out here.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           You should get out more. See the
           sights.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           I am the sights.
           She giggles again, her mood lighter.

<b>                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
</b>           Look at us. We're just like
           Elsie and the young King. What
           would Sir Laurence say if he
           could see us now?

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           I don't think he'd mind.

<b>           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 76.
</b>
                         
           MARILYN grows reflective. She takes COLIN's arm in a
           friendly way as they walk.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           I wanted to be an artist. To
           grow as an actor. I was so proud
           to be working with the great
           Olivier. (Pause) Now he thinks
           I'm the enemy.
           She looks at him innocently. COLIN hesitates.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           He doesn't understand your kind
           of actor. He's hated the method
           ever since Vivien worked with
           Elia Kazan. It's all too new and
           strange. You're the future, and
           it frightens him.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           Every time I walk into the studio
           I feel this sense of doom come
           over me. He looks at me like
           he's smelling a pile of rotten
           fish. And the crew hate me.
           Paula is the only person I can
           trust. (Pause) Except for you
           now, maybe.
           She looks at him, her eyes huge. COLIN feels his senses
           swim as he stares into them...
           ... and then ROGER suddenly appears on the steps.

<b>                          ROGER
</b>           Phone call for you, Miss Monroe.
           It's Mr. Miller.
           MARILYN goes back up the path towards the house, glancing
           back briefly at Colin.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           Goodbye, Colin. Thanks for
           telling me the truth.
           COLIN stares after her. It is a second before he realises
           that ROGER is gazing at him sternly.

<b>                          ROGER
</b>           You'll be leaving now, I expect.

</b>           I don't care if he fucks her
           sideways. Perhaps it'll calm her
           down. (Pause) Oh, hello, boy.
          He smiles cheerfully.

<b>           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 77.
</b>
                         

<b>                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
</b>           I hear you spent last night with
           Marilyn.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           I didn't spend the night with
           her. We just had a chat.

<b>                          MILTON
</b>           I heard them chuckling.
          OLIVIER offers COLIN a lewdly suggestive grin.

<b>                          OLIVIER
</b>           Perhaps if Colin is very
           diplomatic Marilyn is more likely
           to behave herself.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           She just wants a chum, that's
           all.

<b>                          MILTON
</b>           A chum? Jesus Christ, what is
           this, Goodbye Mr. Chips? Grow up,
           kid.
          He barges out of the room, slamming the door behind him.
          OLIVIER checks the effect of his Grand Duke in the mirror
          and sighs abruptly.

<b>                          OLIVIER
</b>           I thought working with Marilyn
           would make me feel young again.
           But I look dead in the rushes.
           Dead behind the eyes.
          He gazes at himself thoughtfully.

<b>                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
</b>           Perhaps I'm angry with her
           because in my heart I know my own
           career is in a terrible rut. I
           wanted to renew myself through
           her but all I see reflected in
           that magnificent face is my own
           inadequacy.
          He leans back.

<b>                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
</b>           You know, I admire Marilyn. I
           really do. Despite her behaviour.
           She has taken everything
           Hollywood can throw at her and
           triumphed.
          COLIN waits, uncertain why OLIVIER is confiding in him.

           to get even a tenth as far as she
           has.
           He glances up at COLIN in the mirror, shrewd and
           sympathetic.

<b>                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
</b>           But be careful, boy. She doesn't

           Gossip is always fast to travel but on a film it goes at
           the speed of light. As COLIN arrives on the set he is
           greeted with wolf whistles and jeers by RICHARD WATTIS,
           PAUL HARDWICK and the crew.

<b>                          SOUNDMAN
</b>           What was Marilyn like then, Col?

<b>                          HARDWICK
</b>           Going over her lines with her,
           were you?

<b>                          SOUNDMAN
</b>           Will she be in today or is she
           too tired?
           It is all good-natured stuff but COLIN feels strangely
           protective, not so much on his own behalf as Marilyn's.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           She was just being friendly.

<b>                          WATTIS
</b>           I'll bet.
           There are hoots of laughter. COLIN retreats to a corner
           only to find RICHARD WATTIS pursuing him.

<b>                          WATTIS (CONT'D)
</b>           Ever heard of the Venus Fly Trap?
           There you are, Colin the innocent
           little fly buzzing about happily,

           attracts you and - Snap!

           life.

           A brief hiatus in filming. COLIN looks on uneasily as
           MARILYN, resting against her lean-to, has her costume
           attended to by LUCY.

<b>                          ORTON

           Three minutes.
           It has just dawned on COLIN that he has missed his date
           with LUCY. Before he can react he is jerked violently
           behind the scenery and pushed up against the wall by an
           angry MILTON.

<b>                          MILTON
</b>           Arthur Miller called me. He's not
           happy with you.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           He doesn't even know who I am.

<b>                          MILTON
</b>           Marilyn must have said something.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           Maybe she was trying to make him
           jealous...
           ORTON turns around frowning furiously at the voices behind
           the set. MILTON pushes COLIN off the set ahead of him.

           MILTON turns bitterly on Colin as soon as they are outside
           the studio door.

<b>                          MILTON
</b>           Listen, kid, I've known Marilyn
           for seven years. I fell in love
           with her, just like you've done.
           COLIN is about to protest but MILTON ignores him.

<b>                          MILTON (CONT'D)

           quit before you get burned.

           COLIN hurries along the corridor, looking for LUCY, who he
           sees pushing a rack of clothes. He stops awkwardly. She
           gazes at him meaningfully, hurt and puzzled.

<b>                          LUCY

</b>           Of course there isn't. Marilyn
           Monroe fancying you? Come on.
           COLIN is put out. Up to now he has never fully confronted
           the possibility of Marilyn wanting him, but he doesn't like
           the idea being dismissed so lightly.
           Lucy sees it and her eyes widen in surprise and hurt.
           Before she can respond MARILYN herself coming towards them
           in her gown, her hair up in towel, surrounded by PAULA and
           her MAKE-UP people. She offers him a dazzling smile.

           COLIN smiles, self-conscious. MARILYN stops and frowns,
           looking at Lucy.

</b>           Hey, are you guys dating? That's

           She looks at him expectantly and suddenly his growing
           fantasy that she might actually be interested in him kicks
           in hard. He shrugs casually.

           like to gossip.
           His voice trails off lamely as he realises he is repeating
           what he has just said to Lucy. MARILYN smiles.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           Too bad. You look cute together.
           She walks off with her retinue. There is a long pause.
           COLIN looks up to see LUCY staring at him in dismay. There
           are sudden tears in her eyes, which she wipes away angrily.

<b>                          LUCY
</b>           I thought you were different.

<b>                          COLIN

           (Pause) Who do you think you are,
           Cary Grant?
           She shoves the rack of clothes back towards the wardrobe
           department. Part of him knows he should go after her, but in
           the end he just stays where he is. He can't help feeling an
           unworthy sense of relief.

           COLIN crosses to the mean little bed on its iron frame and
           collapses on it gratefully. The noise of the rowdy pub floats
           up through the floorboards. He covers his ears with his hands
           then folds the pillow over his head in a desperate attempt to

          MILTON sees a bulky blanket on the back seat.

<b>                          MILTON
</b>           What do you have in there?

<b>                          ROGER
</b>           Just a picnic. We've been looking
           forward to it, haven't we, Colin?
          COLIN looks at him, bemused. He gets in quickly. MILTON
          frowns but shrugs and walks off with a wave.

<b>                          MILTON
</b>           Okay, well, have a nice time boys.
          Inside the car COLIN looks at ROGER.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           Is she okay?
          In the same moment MARILYN herself erupts from under the
          blanket in the back.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>
<b>           SURPRISE!
</b>
<b>                          COLIN
</b>           Oh, Jesus -
          She laughs, looking wonderfully naughty.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           Roger and I decided to take you out
           for an adventure. Didn't we Roger?

<b>                          (PAINED)

</b>           Oh, God. If Milton sees me with
           you... I'll be sacked...
          He tries to scramble out but MARILYN hauls him back
          gleefully.

</b>           No one can sack you, Colin. (Pause)
           Except me, of course.
           She pats the seat next to her.

<b>                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
</b>           I don't like being on my own in the

           Before COLIN can respond he sees the curious MILTON running
           back, having spotted MARILYN in the back.

<b>                          MILTON
</b>           What the hell?
           He peers into the back window. MARILYN screams and buries
           herself back under the blanket. COLIN scrambles to get over
           into the back seat while ROGER stamps on the accelerator and
           the car roars off.

           me? Fired!
           COLIN winces. ROGER looks at him sympathetically. MARILYN
           emerges from under the blanket, tousled and laughing.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           Do you think he saw me?
           COLIN can't help laughing. He finally tumbles into the back
           seat with MARILYN as the car speeds away. She scoots up to
           make room for him.

<b>                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
</b>           Snuggle up. This is fun.
           She threads her arm through his. He gazes down at their hands
           meshed together.
           ROGER's disapproval registers in the faintest flicker of his
           eyes.
           In the background the defeated and frustrated MILTON watches
           the car speed away.

           ROGER has parked up by the sentry post at the entrance to
           the castle. There are two uniformed POLICEMEN on duty.
           ROGER nods to the policemen, who instantly recognise one of
           their own.

<b>                          ROGER
</b>           Detective Chief Superintendant
           Smith. I'm escorting this lady
           and gentleman for the day. They'd
           like to look around the castle.
           As the policemen see MARILYN their eyes widen.

<b>                          POLICEMAN
</b>           Christ, is that..?
           He stares in disbelief. ROGER smiles.

<b>                          ROGER
</b>           Well, it's not Diana bloody Dors,

<b>                          POLICEMAN
</b>           (After a second)
           Does she know anyone here, sir?
           We need to write down a contact
           name in the book.
           ROGER looks stumped at this. He turns to Marilyn.

<b>                          ROGER
</b>           You don't know Her Majesty, by

           The POLICEMAN retreats into his box. We hear him talking on
           the telephone. ROGER looks at COLIN. He shrugs sheepishly.

           The library is a series of magnificent rooms lined from

           covered with important documents - the place is a shrine to
           antique learning and culture. SIR OWEN MORSHEAD (63), the
           Queen's librarian, is a pleasantly eccentric figure with a
           sly wit. He greets COLIN with a friendly, distracted air.

</b>           Colin, my boy! Come in, come in.

</b>           She's beautiful.

<b>                          MORSHEAD
</b>           She was the daughter of one of
           the King's courtiers, nearly 400
           years ago.

<b>                          MARILYN

<b>                          MORSHEAD
</b>           And these are all by Leonardo Da
           Vinci.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           I've heard of him! Didn't he
           paint that lady with the funny
           smile?
          She looks at him, wide-eyed, playing up to her image as the
          dizzy blonde. In fact she knows exactly who Da Vinci is, and
          MORSHEAD is tactful enough to acknowledge it gracefully.

<b>                          MORSHEAD
</b>           The Mona Lisa.

<b>                          MARILYN

<b>                          MORSHEAD
</b>           Alas, that one got away.
          He closes the portfolio and takes MARILYN's arm briskly.

</b>           Now, let's go to the Queen's
           apartments. She's not here at the
           moment, but she will be sorry to
           have missed you.
          MARILYN looks at him, wide-eyed.

           leads her out, with COLIN trailing in their wake.

           COLIN and an astonished MARILYN walk through the school
           buildings with ROGER a discreet distance behind them.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           This isn't a school, it's a
           palace!
           COLIN smiles.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           Eton is 500 years old. It was
           founded by King Henry VI.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           It's like walking through history.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           Take that room up there.
          They stop as COLIN points up at a window.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           That's where the boys were sent
           if they didn't work hard enough.
           Where we were whipped.
          MARILYN looks at him in shock.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           Whipped?

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           Beaten.
          She looks appalled.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           I'd never send my kids away.
           (pause) How long were you here?

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           Five years. But I was sent to
           boarding school when I was eight.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           Why?

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           That's what we do in my family.
          She smiles at this, looking at him shrewdly.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           It seems to me that you've had most
           things pretty easy.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           In one way, yes. But when you're
           brought up in a house of over-
           achievers, it's hard to make your
           own mark.
          She looks at him, sympathetic but pushing a little harder.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           So how are you going to do it?

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           Maybe it will be in films, but if
           not, there are so many
           possibilities out there.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           Sounds pretty good to me.
          She smiles warmly, liking him a lot more for his openness.
          We sense their relationship has moved quietly to a different
          and deeper level.
          But before either of them can say anything a SCHOOLBOY turns
          the corner in his Eton uniform.

           He looks up at MARILYN, his mouth hanging open in shock. Then
           he simply turns and runs, shouting at the top of his voice.

           MARILYN and COLIN are swamped in a joyous mass of Eton
           students. MARILYN smiles, waves, pouts, even kisses one boy
           on the cheek. Cheering BOYS hang out of every window.
           MARILYN blows kisses to them all. ROGER has to plunge into
           the crowd to rescue her. COLIN follows after them with
           difficulty. MARILYN pauses, jumping on a bench to wave
           goodbye and blow more kisses to the boys.

</b>           Work hard, boys! I don't want

           A gawky young teenager near the front shouts out cheekily.

</b>           You can whip me anytime, Marilyn!
           MARILYN laughs in delight. There are cheers as COLIN

           After the riotous excitement of the Eton schoolyard the
           peace and quiet of the river. MARILYN rushes along the
           sandy bank. The water glitters magically.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           Hurry up, slow poke.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           But we haven't got any...
           He stops in mid-sentence as he sees MARILYN unbuttoning her
           blouse and throwing it off carelessly.

           He tears his eyes away from her as she casually strips her
           clothes off. He hurries to find a bush to get changed
           behind. As he ducks down behind it he hears a splash and
           MARILYN's cry of shock as she hits the water.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           Oh my gosh! It's freezing!

           COLIN wades in, wincing at the cold. She laughs.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           This is great.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           What if a boat goes past? We
           could be arrested.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           Don't worry. Roger will fix it.
           Oh, darn it...
           She holds her head and he looks at her with concern.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           What's wrong?

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           I have something in my eye.
           He swims across to her, very aware of her naked body under
           the water. She holds her head up to him.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           I can't see anything.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           Get closer.
           She tips her head back. He looks deep into her eyes - and
           suddenly she grabs him and kisses him on the lips. Before
           he can respond she laughs playfully and swims away.

</b>           That's the first time I've kissed
           anyone younger than me. There's a
           lot of older guys in Hollywood.
           She swims happily, totally relaxed. COLIN is much more self-
           conscious, keeping one nervous eye open for pleasure boats.
           Finally she swims back into the shallows and wades to the
           shore. She glances back, catching Colin looking. He glances
           away, embarrassed.

</b>           Don't be shy, Colin. It's nothing
           you haven't seen before.
          COLIN wades awkwardly to the shore, trying to conceal his
          erection with his cupped hands. MARILYN giggles.

<b>                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
</b>           Oh, Colin! And you an old
           Etonian!
          He grins. She reaches for her blouse and stands shivering
          as she tries to dry herself. COLIN goes to take her in his
          arms.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           Let me warm you up.
          She snuggles into him gratefully, her teeth chattering. He
          rubs her naked back briskly, her thin blouse the only
          barrier between their bodies. Slowly his embrace becomes
          more sensual, his hands slowing, stroking rather than
          rubbing, his face buried in her hair, his arms pulling her

<b>                         CLOSER -

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           Don't spoil it.
          She looks at him, her expression knowing but sweet.

<b>                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
</b>           I want this to be the perfect
           date.
          He tries to kiss her but she ducks her head away gently,
          her expression wistful.

<b>                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
</b>           I haven't had a real date since I
           was 13 years old.
          She suddenly looks much younger, her smile a poignant echo
          of a lost childhood.
          He steps back politely, allowing her to put on her blouse.
          As she buttons it, she gazes at him, then impulsively leans
          forward to kiss him chastely on the lips. The kiss is as
          sweet and innocent as any 13 year old might wish.
          The kiss lasts for a few seconds, their lips touching
          gently, the river shimmering magically in the sunshine
          behind them. When they finally break apart she rewards him
          with a radiant smile.

<b>                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
</b>           That was nice. I don't get kissed
           much.
          She looks wistful for a second but quickly brightens.

</b>           Okay, what do we do now?
           COLIN looks at her, knowing it is time to return to the
           real world but reluctant to face it. There is a discreet
           cough and ROGER appears.

<b>                          ROGER
</b>           Time to go home, I think, Miss
           Monroe.
           She smiles, a little sadly, then gets up, walking past him
           as she puts on the rest of her clothes. ROGER averts his
           eyes respectfully and waits for COLIN. The two men look at
           each other for a second.

<b>                          ROGER (CONT'D)

           the right words. He puts his hand on hers and she squeezes
           it, but then pulls away.

           then gets out, glancing at Milton indifferently.

<b>                          MARILYN

</b>           I don't know what you did to her,

           A gentle summer breeze lifts the net curtains. COLIN is
           fast asleep. There's a sharp rap at the door.

<b>                          ROGER

<b>                          (OFF)

           COLIN opens his eyes, his mind drugged with sleep.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           Roger? What's the matter?

</b>
<b>                          (OFF)

           A cold dread clutches at COLIN's stomach. He stumbles out
           of bed and opens the door. ROGER stands in the doorway

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           Is she dead?

<b>                          ROGER
</b>           She's asking for you. She's sick.
           I think she might be in a coma.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           How can she be asking for me if
           she's in a coma?

<b>                          ROGER

           ROGER and COLIN drive up. MILTON, waits on the steps. He
           looks resentfully at COLIN but doesn't say anything.

</b>           That's her window.
           He points with his torch. The window is open. COLIN shins
           up the ladder while ROGER holds it.

           COLIN tumbles in through the window with a clattering
           thump.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           Marilyn?
           A shaft of moonlight reveals MARILYN lying naked across the
           bed, her body partly covered by the sheet. Half empty pill
           and champagne bottles are scattered all over her dresser;
           there is also an old photograph in a silver frame of her
           mother Gladys.

<b>                          COLIN (CONT'D)
</b>           Marilyn?
           For a second he fears the worst, but then suddenly she
           groans and sits up, looking at him blearily.

<b>           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 98.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           Oh hi, Colin.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           Are you okay? Everyone was
           worried about you.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           Phooey.
           She pats the sheets at her side and settles down sleepily
           on the pillow.

<b>                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
</b>           Get in.
           She is instantly back asleep. COLIN fumbles his way to the
           door. He searches for the key on the side table and quickly
           finds it. He goes to unlock the door, but then pauses,
           looking back at Marilyn. He puts the key back and bends
           down to whisper at the keyhole.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           It's me. She's fine but I'm going
           to keep an eye on her. I'll sleep
           on the sofa.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           (After a second)
           I can't find the key. (Pause) You
           can all go to bed now.

           COLIN goes back to the bed and gazes at the sleeping
           Marilyn, his expression suffused with a tenderness we have
           never seen in him before. He pulls up the sheet so that it
           covers her nakedness, then tentatively lies down to rest
           his head on the pillow.

           COLIN wakes with a jolt as the light snaps on, blinding
           him.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           Colin? What are you doing here?
           MARILYN sits up, the sheet clutched to her chest, her
           expression panicky and disoriented. COLIN hurls himself off
           the bed.

<b>           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 99.
</b>
                         

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           I came in through the window...
          He realises this doesn't sound reassuring.

<b>                          COLIN (CONT'D)
</b>           Milton thought you were sick.
          She stares at him in puzzlement then breaks into a dazed
          smile.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           The window? Is there a balcony,
           like in Romeo And Juliet? How
           romantic. (Pause) But I'm not
           sick. What makes them think that?
          She reaches instinctively for the pill container on her
          bedside table.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           Please don't take any more pills.
          She frowns, clutching the pill bottle in one hand. He
          reaches out and prises it gently from her grasp. As he puts
          it back on the side he glances at the framed photograph.
           COLIN (CONT'D) (cont'd)
           Who's that?

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           My mom.
          Her expression softens as she looks at the picture.

<b>                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
</b>           They took her to the Sanatorium
           when I was a kid. I grew up in
           other people's homes, mostly.
          Alongside her mother's photo is another framed picture,
          this time of Abraham Lincoln. COLIN frowns.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           Abraham Lincoln?

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           I don't know who my father is so
           it might as well be him. Why not?
           I can pick any father I want.
          She smiles, then looks at Colin wistfully.

<b>                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
</b>           Do you have a home, Colin? A real
           one?

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           Yes, I do.

<b>          MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 100.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           And a mother and father who still
           live together?

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           Yes.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           And do they love you?

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           I'm sure they do.
          He nods. She smiles sadly.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           You're lucky.
          Her eyes fill with tears. She looks up at him anxiously.

<b>                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
</b>           Do you love me, Colin?
          He stares at her. She looks lovely but desperately
          vulnerable.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           Yes.
          She reaches for the pills and pours three or four into her
          palm. COLIN gently takes her hand and takes two of them
          away. She smiles, not objecting as he settles her back
          gently on the pillow.

<b>                          COLIN (CONT'D)
</b>           But you and I come from different
           worlds. You're like some Greek
           Goddess to me...

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           I'm not Greek.
          She smiles, teasing him. He smiles back. She takes his
          hand, looking at him in appeal.

<b>                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
</b>           I don't want to be a Goddess. I
           just want to be loved like an
           ordinary girl.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           Mr. Miller loves you.
          She stares at him, her face going blank with misery.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           I found his notebook. It said I'd
           let him down.

<b>          MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 101.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           Writers scribble all kinds of
           things. It doesn't mean anything.
          She looks at him, her eyes full of pain.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           He wanted me to find it. It said
           he should never have married me.
           That I was unpredictable and a
           woman-child, flighty and self-
           centred. He's left me, Colin. Why
           do the people I love always leave
           me?
          She looks so wretched, so completely baffled, that COLIN
          responds with sudden passion.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           I'll never leave you.
          She smiles and embraces him gratefully. She sighs.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           All people ever see is Marilyn
           Monroe. As soon as they realise
           I'm not her, they run.
          He lies down next to her, taking her awkwardly in his arms.
          She sighs sleepily.

<b>                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
</b>           Boy, there's a lot of men in this
           business. And they all think
           you've got to sleep with them.
          She looks across at him, their faces inches apart.

<b>                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
</b>           You're not like that. That's why
           I like you.
          COLIN stares back at her guiltily. She smiles.

<b>                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
</b>           You should date that Wardrobe
           lady. She's pretty.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           I don't want to. (Pause) I love
           you, Marilyn.
          She stares at him and tears gather in her eyes again. They
          stare intently at each other, their mood fragile, touched
          with both sensuality and a longing for something less
          tangible. MARILYN leans forward and kisses him gently. The
          embrace grows in passion and they kiss properly, hungrily.
          He kisses her eyes and her face and she sighs happily.
          He wants her more than he has wanted anything before.

<b>          MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 102.
</b>
                         
          And then he stops. The fantasy he has been pursuing for
          weeks is within his grasp but he knows that whatever it
          does for him it will only damage her further. He pulls away
          from her gently. Her eyes flicker open lazily.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           What's the matter? Don't you want
           to make love?

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           Maybe we should just be friends.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           Okay. Friends.
          She wraps herself around him, curling up so their bodies
          cradle each other like spoons in a cutlery draw. As she
          buries her head in his neck he feels her breasts against
          his back. She curls against him.

<b>                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
</b>           This is nice. Like spoons. I used
           to do this with Johnny.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           Who's Johnny?

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           Johnny Hyde. My agent, back in
           the old days. He was thin, like
           you...
          Her voice is blurred and drifting with sleep. With her body
          warm against him COLIN's resolve nearly snaps but he is
          clear eyed now and determined.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           Marilyn?
          She mutters softly in reply.

           First light streams in through the curtains. COLIN wakes to
           hear Marilyn singing cheerfully. He gets up and sees her
           through the open door of the bathroom sitting in the bath,
           her back towards him. She is practicing the gentle waltz
           tune she is to sing in the film.

           COLIN races up the road and arrives panting at the gate a
           few seconds before OLIVIER's car swings into the entrance.
           The great man leans out of the back window.

<b>                          OLIVIER
</b>           Morning, boy. (Pause) Christ, you

           He looks at him thoughtfully, then shrugs.

           MARILYN, OLIVIER and WATTIS act a scene together; a drunken
           Elsie Marina is being seduced by the Grand Duke, and

</b>           "No, sir, Miss Marina's aunt has
           been in a motor accident. The

           urgently."

<b>           MARILYN (AS ELSIE)
</b>           "What? (Giggles drunkenly) Oh, go
           away, you silly man."

<b>           WATTIS (AS NORTHBROOK)
</b>           "Miss Marina, your aunt... you
           realise how serious her condition
           is?"

<b>           MARILYN (AS ELSIE)
</b>           "Well, it's her own fault. She
           has no right being out at this
           time of night. She's 93!"
           MARILYN is utterly adorable. The crew, COLIN, amongst them,
           can't take their eyes off her. OLIVIER glances at ORTON
           behind the camera. They have a good take and they know it.

<b>                          ORTON

           MARILYN is as happy as we have ever seen her. She seeks out
           COLIN amongst the crowd and beams at him. Half the crew,
           including OLIVIER, notice the look. COLIN blushes self-
           consciously but we can feel his pride.

           COLIN paces nervously up and down the hall. PAULA appears.
           She looks at him for a long, unnerving moment then speaks
           with sudden ferocity.

<b>                          PAULA
</b>           From the first moment all I have
           felt is Olivier's loathing and
           contempt. He thinks I'm
           unnecessary. Me, her drama coach,
           surrogate mother, nursemaid. On
           call 24 hours a day to help her
           act, dole out pills, bolster her
           ego, keep her sober enough to work.
           (Pause) Me. Unnecessary. (Pause) No
           me, no Marilyn.
           He is taken aback by her passion. She smiles bitterly then
           walks on. COLIN hesitates. She looks back briefly.

<b>                          PAULA (CONT'D)

           MARILYN lies in bed with MILTON possessively at her side.
           COLIN comes in with PAULA. MARILYN looks at him dully, her
           eyes clouded and unfocused. A half empty pill bottle stands
           on the side. COLIN sits down next to her and she takes his
           hand, ignoring the surprised look on Milton's face.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           You think I can act, don't you,
           Colin?

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           Of course I do. You were
           wonderful today.
           PAULA looks at MILTON, then moves between them busily.

<b>                          PAULA
</b>           Marilyn's tired now.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           I want him to stay with me.

<b>                          MILTON
</b>           What would Arthur say if he knew
           Colin was here?
           A flicker of terror crosses MARILYN's face. COLIN turns on
           them angrily.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           You heard what she said. She

          MILTON looks at him grimly but finally surrenders the
          field. Paula is more reluctant to give in. She sits on the
          bed, stroking Marilyn's hand.

<b>                          PAULA
</b>           You have no idea of your position
           in the world, Marilyn. You are the
           greatest actress there's ever been.
           Not just actress. The greatest
           woman of this or any time. I love
           you like a daughter.
          COLIN is surprised to see tears in her eyes.

<b>                          PAULA (CONT'D)
</b>           It's hard now, but believe me you
           will survive this and go on to
           better things. Your life is ahead
           of you. You're young, just
           beginning.
          Paula's love and sincerity are obvious. She means it. COLIN
          watches her in silence. MARILYN squeezes her hand and PAULA
          gets up with a heavy sigh, bitterly reluctant to leave.
          Finally she drags herself out, leaving them alone.
          As the door closes MARILYN curls herself up in the bed.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           I'm so tired of feeling scared.
           Life is so shitty. I hate it. It
           hurts too much.
          COLIN looks at her, his heart breaking at her anguish.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           I'm here now. I'll look after
           you.
          She gives him a wry look, teasing but thoughtful.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           Good old Colin. Looking after me,
           looking after Larry, looking after
           Vivien. Always putting everyone
           before yourself.
          There is an edge to this. He gazes at her, shaken, but she
          smiles and touches his face gently.
          He gets on the bed, fully clothed, to fold her in his arms.

           COLIN wakes with a start as he realises that MARILYN is

</b>           It hurts! It hurts, Colin!
           She is doubled up, clutching her stomach, sweating and
           frightened. COLIN sees a dark red stain on the sheets.

</b>           It's a surprise. For Arthur.

           MILTON gives him a sharp look but he no longer cares about
           anything except Marilyn. There is a shuffling sound and the
           door is unlocked. At the same moment PAULA comes rushing
           in, hair awry, gown flapping, a wild look in her eye.

<b>                          PAULA

           The HOUSEKEEPER now appears at the door with an elderly man

</b>           Perhaps you'd all like to give us
           a little privacy?
           As COLIN shepherds the others out MILTON turns on him
           bitterly.

           MILTON, PAULA, ROGER and COLIN all step forward as one.

           from his hand.

           to live together. You could have

          He is close to tears, suddenly looking very young. She
          looks at him with a sad, sweet smile. He shakes his head
          stubbornly, taking her hand in passionate appeal.

           ever dreamed about.
          She smiles tentatively, but he sees a terrible fear in her
          eyes. He looks down, realising with a cruel stab of pain
          that Olivier was right. There is no way back. She doesn't
          want to be rescued.
          He finally looks up, smiling despite the tears in his eyes.

           You're a star. The biggest star
           in the world.

          goes to the door, pausing for a second as he looks back.

</b>           OLIVIER sits in front of his make-up mirror in his Grand
           Ducal uniform, smoothing down his hair with pomade. COLIN
           knocks and comes in.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           They're ready for you on set, Sir
           Laurence.

<b>                          OLIVIER
</b>           Marilyn?

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           She's just arrived.

<b>                          OLIVIER
</b>           Only an hour late. Not bad by her
           standards.
           He smiles, then stands up, straightening his uniform.

<b>                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
</b>           Maybe we will finish this bloody
           film after all.

           The crew are ready. The actors are on set. OLIVIER stands by
           the camera. COLIN is half-hidden in the shadows. There is a
           flurry of activity and MARILYN emerges, with PAULA on one
           side and MILTON on the other. She looks exactly as Marilyn
           should. With her white dress shimmering in the lights and her
           platinum blonde hair glowing, she has the air of a Goddess.
           She sweeps past only inches away from Colin but ignores him.
           He can't help feeling a stiletto sharp pang of regret.

</b>
<b>           112A.
</b>          MARILYN turns to the assembled crew. A silence settles. She
          smiles around, blinking in the lights. She looks for comfort
          or support among the technicians but sees only blank faces or
          sullen hostility. She smiles nervously.

<b>                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
</b>           I hope you will all forgive me. It
           wasn't altogether my fault. I have
           been ill.
          She smiles up at their uneasy expressions, struggling to
          understand herself and their expectations of her.

<b>                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
</b>           I'd like you to remember I tried.
          This oddly moving and open confession is received in silence.
          No one quite knows how to react to her lacerating honesty.
          Perhaps they think it is just another performance.

<b>          147A INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 147A
</b>
           OLIVIER, in character, lies back on a sofa, with MARILYN on
           top of him, singing the waltz that Colin first heard after
           his night with her. MARILYN looks kittenish and irresistible
           as she sings only a few inches from OLIVIER's face.

<b>           MARILYN (AS ELSIE)
</b>           "..I found a dream and lay in your
           arms the whole night through, I'm
           yours no matter what others may say
           or do. Be light of heart and fancy
           free, that's the way to start,
           there will be nothing to lose till
           you lose your heart.."
           She sings with touching delicacy, nailing it perfectly. There
           is pin drop silence on the set as the crew watch. COLIN is
           amongst them. It is a moment of almost unbearable poignancy
           for him. He suddenly realises that SYBIL THORNDIKE has crept
           up silently behind him to watch the scene. As he turns to her
           she smiles with infinite wisdom and compassion, murmuring
           softly so that only he can hear.

<b>                          SYBIL THORNDIKE
</b>           First love is such sweet despair,
           Colin.
           She touches his cheek gently and smiles, perhaps lost in a
           long ago memory of her own, before retreating quietly into
           the darkness at the back of the set.

           Inch by laborious inch The Sleeping Prince moves towards the
           finish line. We see a montage of scenes being filmed -
           - HARDWICK enters as Major Domo through the main door of the
           oval room, carrying a silver tray bearing shaving
           equipment...
           - WATTIS and JEREMY SPENSER crossing the drawing room to the
           Grand Duke's bedroom...
           - WATTIS crosses the drawing room and knocks on a door...
           The process is hardly any easier but somehow the work is
           done, until we come to the final shot in the sequence -

<b>                          ORTON
</b>           Very quiet, studio! Going for a

           The big overhead lights switch on with a series of heavy
           clunks.

</b>
<b>           ACTION!
</b>           MARILYN looks up, in character as Elsie, her eyes glowing.

<b>           OLIVIER (AS REGENT)
</b>           "My dear..."

<b>           MARILYN (AS ELSIE)
</b>           "I've got a solemn word of warning
           for you."

<b>           OLIVIER (AS REGENT)
</b>           "What's that, my beloved?"

<b>           MARILYN (AS ELSIE)
</b>           "You know what's going to happen?
           I'm going to fall in love with you,
           because I always, always do."
           CLOSE on MARILYN as she smiles, her face radiating joy and
           vitality.
           And then, in the split second before ORTON calls `cut',
           MARILYN turns her head just a fraction and winks at Colin. He
           grins. OLIVIER looks up from the sofa, notices and smiles
           indulgently.

<b>                          ORTON
</b>           Cut! Okay boys and girls, that's a
           wrap!
           There is a smattering of applause from the crew. MARILYN
           leaves the stage.

                         

<b>          148A INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. CORRIDOR. DAY. 148A

           MARILYN walks away from us, down the long corridor, alone.

                         

<b>          149 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 149
</b>
           The crew shake hands and clap each other on the back like a
           group of hardened war veterans. ORTON offers COLIN a
           grudging nod - `well done'. MILTON now comes forward,
           calling out above the hubbub.

<b>                          MILTON
</b>           If you'd all like to step this way,
           you'll find something I think
           you'll like.
           MILTON indicates a trestle table at one end of the studio,
           loaded with gaily wrapped parcels. He ushers the crew over.

<b>                          MILTON (CONT'D)
</b>           A parting gift to each of you from
           Marilyn. Men on the left, ladies on
           the right.

</b>
                         
          At first there is a buzz of excitement but then something odd
          happens. One of the crew simply picks up his present without
          looking at it and drops it in the large bin standing against
          the wall.
          There is a moment, then a WOMAN does the same with hers.
          Suddenly there is a rush for the bin as almost everyone dumps
          their present. The bin is soon overflowing.
          MILTON stares at the scene, then simply shrugs and walks out.
          ARTHUR JACOBS, utterly indifferent to the hostile
          undercurrent, grins and waves cheerfully.

<b>                          JACOBS
</b>           It's been a lot of fun, kids. See
           you at the Academy Awards.
          He goes out, grabbing a discarded bottle of booze from the
          dustbin as he goes.
          COLIN watches all this in shocked silence. He looks at the
          label on his own small parcel, which reads simply "To Colin,
          with thanks, Marilyn".

           The wardrobe department is empty except for LUCY, who
           cradles her own gift from Marilyn. COLIN comes in, looking
           nervous. They look at each other awkwardly.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           Aren't you going to throw yours
           away?

<b>                          LUCY
</b>           Of course not. It's from Marilyn
           Monroe.
           He smiles. She shrugs and turns to leave.

           Lucy?
           She turns back to look at him.

<b>                          COLIN (CONT'D)
</b>           I was wondering if you're doing
           anything this Saturday.

<b>                          LUCY
</b>           I'm washing my hair.
           He nods, accepting this as no more than he deserves. She
           goes but then stops to look back at him.

<b>                          LUCY (CONT'D)
</b>           Did she break your heart?

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           (After a second)
           A little.

<b>                          LUCY
</b>           Good. It needed breaking.
           There is no malice in her response, just an awareness that
           he is older and wiser now, and perhaps a better man for the
           experience. He nods, accepting the rebuke.

<b>                          LUCY (CONT'D)
</b>           (After a second)
           I might be free on Wednesday.
           COLIN smiles. She goes out. He looks down at Marilyn's
           present in his hands.

           COLIN walks down the hall. He notices the red light is on
           outside the viewing theatre. As he goes towards it he sees
           ROGER coming the other way on his way out of the studio, his
           job done. The two men smile; an acknowledgment of everything
           they've been through together. ROGER offers him a friendly
           salute and then goes on his way.

           OLIVIER sits on his own, watching an edited version of the
           "The Coconut Girl" sequence (Scenes 61 and 62). COLIN comes
           in. OLIVIER glances at him.

          COLIN sits down next to the great man. They watch in
          silence as another sequence is projected for them. The
          sequence shows MARILYN improvising in the champagne and
          caviar scene. She serves herself food and drink before
          collapsing, drunk. The endless retakes and fluffs gone,
          what remains is a gifted comic performance by a luminous
          beauty.

</b>           (After a second)
           She's quite wonderful. No
           training, no craft, no guile,
           just pure instinct. Astonishing.
          He seems almost lost in awe. COLIN gazes at him in
          surprise.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           You should tell her that.

<b>                          OLIVIER
</b>           Oh, I will. But she won't believe
           me. That's probably what makes
           her great. It's certainly what
           makes her so profoundly unhappy.
          He smiles wryly.

<b>                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
</b>           I tried my best to change her,
           but she remains brilliant despite
           me. (Pause) Directing a movie has
           to be just about the best job
           ever invented, but Marilyn has
           cured me of ever wanting to do it
           again.
          He signals to the projection box and the film stops as the
          lights come up.

           believe me, most of the time, I
           really am the best.

</b>           You've done a good job, boy.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           Run it again, please.
           The lights go down. MARILYN's face appears on the screen,
           laughing and happy. It is another sequence, the one where
           Marilyn does her sweet, uninhibited little dance (Scene
           90), a performance both sexy and yet touchingly innocent.
           HOLD on COLIN for a long moment, gazing at her image in the
           darkness, then -

           The circus is leaving. The film is shutting down. Not knowing
           his next job COLIN sits, suitcase next to his chair, wearing
           the 'Marilyn' experience on his face and in his soul. Head
           down, sipping a pint. He could be a regular here.
           BARRY behind the bar, flitting around - the dart players and
           regulars at play.
           And then, as if a gust of wind invaded, BARRY looks up and
           freezes. The DART PLAYER, sensing something, turns to look up
           as well. The regulars are frozen in mid-action.
           COLIN is missing it all. 100% of his attention is given to
           his woe and his pint.

</b>           Can I get another one of those

           BARRY for once is silent, pours a pint. The regulars try not
           to stare.

           the car door for MARILYN.
           MARILYN beckons him closer. She kisses him gently. He smiles
           and says lightly:

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           What's that for?

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           That's for being on my side; and
           remember, when you see me wink,
           that's for you.
           ROGER walks around the car and looks over at COLIN.

<b>                          ROGER
</b>           (glancing at COLIN)
           Looking a couple of inches taller
           than when I first saw you.
           ROGER nods at COLIN (a silent salute suggesting job well
           done.) He gets into the car and we stay on COLIN as he
           watches it pull away. BARRY comes to the doorway of the pub.

<b>                          BARRY
</b>           Was that really Marilyn Monroe?

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           No - just a good friend of mine.
           BARRY walks back into the pub, leaving COLIN alone, staring
           at the vanishing car. And then the sun swallows it as it
           drives into the English countryside.

</b>
           COLIN walks along chatting to friends. Dressed in a neat
           dark suit he looks older and more confident. There is
           little sign left of the callow young man who paced up and
           down the pavement outside Sir Laurence Olivier's office.
           We see the caption: SIX YEARS LATER.

                         

<b>          154 INT. COLIN'S OFFICE. WARDOUR STREET. DAY. 154
</b>
           COLIN walks into a small office. Film cans are piled up all
           over the floor and books and papers spill off the shelves.
           A SECRETARY sits typing at her desk. COLIN goes to his own
           desk, glances at his diary, then looks up.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           Any messages?
           THE SECRETARY pushes a piece of paper at him.

<b>                          SECRETARY
</b>           It's probably just someone having
           a joke.
           COLIN looks down at the message. There is a Los Angeles
           phone number and then the name - Marilyn Monroe.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           (After a moment)
           Did she say anything?

<b>                          SECRETARY
</b>           She just asked you to call.
           (Pause) It is a joke, isn't it?
           COLIN stares down at the paper.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           Probably. (Pause) Book a call as
           soon as you can. Los Angeles,

           It is late. COLIN stares at the number on the scrap of
           paper.
           The phone rings. He picks it up eagerly.

<b>                          OPERATOR
</b>           Your call to Los Angeles.
           We hear the crackle of the international line. He waits
           anxiously as the ringing continues.

<b>           DAY.
</b>           The room is large and tasteful - white sofas and cushions
           and deep rugs. Picture windows look out onto the Hollywood
           hills.
           A white phone rings on the table.
           It rings continuously, insistently.
           It carries on ringing.
           No one comes.
           HOLD on the jangling phone. Each time it rings we think
           Marilyn might appear, but she never does.
           It carries on ringing, unanswered, in the empty room. As
           the picture fades we hear like a ghostly lament the sweet
           echo of Marilyn's voice singing the Sleeping Prince Waltz.

<b>           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 119.

           yours no matter what others may
           say or do. Be light of heart and
           fancy free, that's the way to
           start, there will be nothing to
           lose till you lose your heart..."
           The fragile voice hangs in the air for a second, then slowly
           drifts away to nothing.

                         

<b>          157 INT. COLIN'S OFFICE. WARDOUR STREET. NIGHT. 157
</b>
           COLIN sits with the phone to his ear. The sound of Marilyn
           singing the Sleeping Prince Waltz dies away and we realise
           has been revisiting it in his memory.
           He waits as long as he can but it is obvious no one is going
           to answer. In the end he puts the receiver back in its cradle
           in resignation.
           His gaze drifts up to a shelf stacked with film cans. He
           stands up and looks through them, blowing dust away; they
           have been here for a long time, ignored. He finds the one he
           is looking for - it says simply MM on the can.
           He takes the short reel of film and threads it through a
           Movieola in the corner of the room. He turns it on and bends
           to look.
           The screen bursts into life with an image of MARILYN at her
           most vital and captivating. It is a copy of some rushes from
           The Prince And The Showgirl, perhaps given to Colin by
           Olivier, or perhaps "borrowed" as a souvenir and long since
           forgotten.
           We see MARILYN dancing happily, exaggerating off camera,
           looking playful and sexy. She is radiant and full of life.
           After a moment she turns and looks off camera - perhaps to
           where Colin himself would have been standing - and winks
           happily.
           Blown up to the full size of the screen it is utterly sweet
           and charming.
           There is something so completely natural about the gesture
           COLIN feels he has been swept back seven years in time and
           MARILYN is standing in front of him again, in the flesh. It
           moves and delights him; perhaps he has never even really seen
           this clip before. At any rate he hasn't thought about it for
           years.
           It is MARILYN as he will always remember her, relaxed,
           affectionate and vital, a part of her, however tiny, forever
           his.
           She smiles, laughs at something, giggles in delight (without
           sound). She says something to an unseen crew member, then
           looks back, smiling at the camera.

<b>          MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 120.
</b>
                         
          Her face fills the screen.
          Beautiful, timeless -
          Happy.
          HOLD on the image for as long as we dare, then -

<b>           FADE TO BLACK.
