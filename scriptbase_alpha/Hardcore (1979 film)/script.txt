CREDITS

Credits are played over Currier and Ives-like winter scenes 
from life in Grand Rapids. It's Christmas morning.

-- Two well-bundled youths shovel out a suburban driveway 
while their father scrapes ice off the family car.

-- Youths pelter a passing car with snowballs. Others, more 
daring companions, grab onto the car's rear bumper and hitch 
a free ride across the icy roads and past a sign which reads 
"Grand Rapids City Limits."

-- Christmas decorations hang from the lamp posts on Monroe 
Avenue.

-- Children, dressed in bright parkas, and breathing steam, 
compare their Christmas presents: sleds, skis and a toboggan. 
In the b.g., other children speed down Richmond Park Hill.

-- A woman's distant voice sings an old hymn:

"Precious memories, unseen angels, 
Sent from somewhere to my soul, 
How they linger ever near me, 
And the sacred past unfolds. 
Precious memories, how they linger, 
How they ever flood my soul, 
In the stillness of the midnight, 
Precious sacred scenes unfold. 
Precious father, loving mother, 
Fly across the lonely years, 
And old home scenes of my childhood 
In fond memories appear."

END CREDITS.

INT. VAN DORN HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Four generations of the Van Dorn family have gathered at the 
family home.

A long kitchen leads to the dining area, then to the spacious 
living room.

The house is perhaps one hundred years old; deeply varnished 
woodwork and patterned yellow wallpaper section off the walls.

Apart from several recent tasteless acquisitions (an E-Z Boy 
lounge chair to replace the old Queen Anne which broke two 
Easters ago), the house remains furnished in the style of 
the previous century. The old dining room table, which 
Grandfather Van Dorn built because he was too cheap to buy 
one, has now become a priceless antique.

The rooms are littered with religious calendars, Bibles and 
plaster-of-Paris plaques bearing such sentiments as "As For 
Me and My House, We Will Serve the Lord." The oak buffet is 
laden with similar religious knickknacks and chintz. Framed, 
tinted photographs of the family patriarchs are 
indiscriminately mixed with newer snapshots of proud fathers 
and high school graduates.

The house radiates a sense of continuity. Generations come 
and go; the family remains. All of life's "old home scenes" 
have been played out here: births, deaths, romances, 
blasphemies, betrayals. And now the air is again alive with 
the sounds of playing children, busy housewives and bickering 
uncles.

The kitchen is crowded with mothers, daughters and aunts. 
Each has brought a special dish. ANNE DE JONG (nee Van Dorn), 
thirty-five, supervises the final preparations. One aunt 
shows another snapshots of her new grandchild.

JAKE VAN DORN, forty, and his brother JOE, fifty, sit at the 
table watching the kitchen activity.

The house echoes with small talk:

          AUNT
     ...He got accepted at Grand Valley, 
     but he'd rather go to Michigan...

          NEPHEW #1
     ...Get that pink rot...

          NEPHEW #2
     ...No way Uncle Joe talk me into 
     cutting celery again this summer. 
     Rather work in the car wash.

As the CAMERA TRACKS THROUGH the dining room, it passes a 
cluster of men standing near the buffet. WES DE JONG and 
JOHN VAN DORN, both about forty, casually discuss a 
theological point with GRANDFATHER VAN DORN. Across the table, 
a young boy, about eleven, listens with rapt awe.

These are men of the soil. Their faces are sun-blotched and 
weather-beaten. Wes has rolled up the sleeves of his white 
shirt; John has switched to a more comfortable plaid.

          JOHN
     ...I still say that if a man has 
     committed the unpardonable sin, he 
     knows he has.

Grandfather nods head approvingly.

          WES
     I don't know about that, John. It 
     don't seem to account much for God's 
     grace.

          JOHN
     What kind of grace do you mean, 
     universal or specific...?

INT. BASEMENT - DAY

A long line of folding tables have been set up in the 
basement. A mixed assortment of chairs can accommodate thirty 
or more persons. A pre-teen daughter helps her mother place 
dishes and silverware on the tablecloths. Evergreen branches 
and red candles decorate the tables.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

INT. DEN - DAY

Most of the teenagers have crowded into what was once called 
the study, but is now the "television room." KRISTEN VAN 
DORN, fourteen, and MARSHA DE JONG, fifteen, are scrunched 
onto the sofa. Kristen has long blonde hair, a clean Dutch 
complexion and an unaffected beauty. The girls' legs are 
innocently wrapped around each other's.

JOE, forty-five, another of the Van Dorn brothers, and a 
male cousin about nineteen, are also squeezed on the sofa. 
Young children squat on the floor in front of them. All are 
watching some inane Christmas variety show.

Joe, bored of this tripe, gets up and turns off the set. The 
children wail in unison. "Aw, c'mon, Uncle Joe."

          JOE
     I'm sick of watching this television 
     stuff. You know who makes it? All 
     the kids who couldn't get along here. 
     They go out to California and make 
     television. I didn't like 'em when 
     they were here, and I don't like 'em 
     out there.

One of the youngsters reaches over and snaps the set back on 
as Joe leaves the room.

                                   CUT TO:

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

As Joe leaves the den, he passes Jake Van Dorn and Wes De 
Jong. Unlike his older brother, Jake is not a man of the 
soil. He has been to college and runs his own business. He 
looks well-groomed and comfortable in his navy suit, white 
shirt and striped tie. Wes is Jake's brother-in-law and 
friend. They get along well enough.

          JOE
          (to Jake and Wes)
     Television. If you don't buy one 
     yourself, the kids go someplace else 
     and watch. And what do they sell on 
     television? More televisions.

          JAKE
          (light)
     They got to make their money, too, 
     Joe. Give the kids a break. It's 
     Christmas.

Joe shrugs and walks into the dining room.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

INT. BASEMENT - DAY

Anne listens as NADINE, her sister-in-law, about forty, and 
RUTH, her niece, about twenty, help her set out celery and 
carrot stalks.

          RUTH
     ...and they hadn't heard a word from 
     him before he died.

Three children, BILL, LENARD and JANE, ages six to ten, walk 
over to the three mothers. Lenard, six years old, wears a 
blanket over his head in mock Biblical dress.

          BILL
     Aunt Ruth, can we use Timmy for the 
     Nativity play? We need him to play 
     the Christ-child.

          RUTH
     But Timmy's only six months old.

          BILL
     We won't hurt him. I'm going to be 
     Joseph, Jane's Mary and Lenard will 
     be one of the shepherds.

Bill looks at blanket-headed Lenard, who has no idea of what's 
going on.

          RUTH
     I don't think so...

          NADINE
     You can't do that. That's blasphemy. 
     If anybody pretends to be Christ, 
     it's blasphemy.

          BILL
     But he's only a baby.

Anne nods in agreement. Bill seems disappointed.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Jake and West stand with their arms around their respective 
daughters, Kristen and Marsha. The girls squirm and giggle 
politely.

          JAKE
          (teasing Marsha)
     Your dad and I aren't sure you and 
     Kristen should go on the YC Convention 
     tomorrow.

          KRISTEN
     Oh, Dad.

Wes plays along:

          WES
     I don't know, Kristen, that's a long 
     trip to be on a bus with all those 
     boys.

          MARSHA
     You mean those creeps.

          KRISTEN
     There are more chaperones than boys 
     anyway.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

INT. BASEMENT - DAY

Every family is in place. The social order is complete: 
grandfather, parents, children, grandchildren. The long table 
is stacked high with salads, casseroles, and vegetables.

The diners turn their heads toward Jake who stands at the 
far end of the table, his closed fists pressed against the 
tabletop. He lowers his head in prayer.

One of the mothers, looking at her son, Lenard, quickly pulls 
the blanket off his head.

The CAMERA TRACKS ACROSS the table toward Jake.

          JAKE
     We thank the Lord for bringing this 
     family together at graduation time. 
     We ask Thee to watch over this family 
     and keep us together in the coming 
     year.

                                   CUT TO:

EXT. JAKE'S HOUSE - MORNING

Two cars are parked in the driveway of Van Dorn's suburban 
ranch-style home.

                                   CUT TO:

INT. KRISTEN'S ROOM - MORNING

Marsha sits on the bed as Kristen finishes packing her 
suitcase.

The items include: a bright red sweater, jeans, underclothes, 
Tampax, and a Bible.

                                   CUT TO:

INT. DINING AREA - MORNING

Jake, Wes and Anne wait in the spotless dining area. Harold 
Jay looks in the refrigerator.

          JAKE
          (to Anne)
     Sis, would you check if Kristen has 
     everything packed?

Anne nods and walks into the bedroom.

          WES
     You want to go for coffee after we 
     send the girls off?

          JAKE
     No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get 
     over to the office.

          WES
     Anne wants to make sure you come 
     over for dinner Sunday. With Kristen 
     gone you'll be all alone.

Jake nods.

Kristen, wearing a light blue sweater and skirt, emerges 
from the bedroom. She smiles demurely.

Her suitcase is in her hand. Jake, for a moment, feels a 
sharp twinge of loss. A foreboding of the day when Kristen, 
fully grown, will leave his house for good.

                                   CUT TO:

EXT. TWELFTH ST. CHURCH - DAY

Parents watch their children board a snow-covered bus outside 
Twelfth St. Church. A banner across the side of the bus reads:

               YOUNG CALVINIST CONVENTION

               GRAND RAPIDS, MICH. -- BELLFLOWER, CALIF.

Most of the parents, working folk long accustomed to the 
brutal Michigan winters, wear heavy overcoats, bearskin caps, 
fur-lined gloves and galoshes.

Jake, bare-headed and wearing a thin topcoat over his suit, 
waits with Kristen, Marsha, Wes and Anne. Harold Jay pelts 
the side of the bus with a snowball.

MRS. STEENSMA, one of the trip counselors, reads off the 
youngsters' names as they board the bus:

          MRS. STEENSMA
     ...Daverman, DeBeer, DeBoer, DeJong, 
     DeVries...

Marsha kisses her parents goodbye and heads toward the bus.

          MRS. STEENSMA
          (continuing)
     ...Vander Ark, Vander Hoven, Vander 
     Keen, Van Dorn, Van Dyke, E., Van 
     Dyke, S...

When Kristen hears her name she starts toward the bus, then 
stops, comes back and gives her father a farewell kiss.

          JAKE
     Take care of yourself, Kristen. I 
     love you.

          KRISTEN
     I will, Daddy.

          JAKE
     If you need anything, just call.

Later, amid horn-honking and farewells, the bus pulls away 
from the curb and heads down the snowy street.

INT. BUS - DAY

A sigh of relief goes up from the adolescent conventioneers: 
wheew! There are a few isolated cries of "We're on our way!"

A teenager instantly flips on his transistor RADIO to metal 
ROCK. Once away from home, these kids, like all kids, are 
the children of 1976. The old family glue doesn't hold. They 
live in the world of rock and television.

                                   CUT TO:

INT. FACTORY - DAY

Workmen fashion table legs on a wood lathe. In another part 
of the factory, laborers assemble chair frames.

Jake walks along the assembly line with MARY, a well-dressed, 
attractive employee about twenty-five. They turn a corner 
and step into a display area where a set features the Van 
Dorn Co.'s new modular office designs.

Mary shows Jake the set for his approval.

          JAKE
     Is this all the display space we can 
     get?

          MARY
     I tried to get more, but this is the 
     limit. The De Vries line has the 
     same area.

Mary is a cool, efficient display designer. Jake studies a 
patch of bright blue on the right wall.

          JAKE
     What do you think of this... ah, 
     shade of blue, Mary.

          MARY
     I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.

          JAKE
     Don't you think it's a little too... 
     bright?

          MARY
     Not really. But if you want me to 
     tone it down...

          JAKE
     No, no. I wouldn't hire a display 
     designer if I didn't trust her taste. 
     Maybe we should bring in more of 
     that shade. Perhaps a stripe across 
     the back wall.

He gestures.

Gently, relentlessly, Jake manipulates Mary. He does not 
wish to impose his taste on her but, through calculated 
argument, will get her to accept his views. It's only a matter 
of time before he wears her down.

          MARY
     No, that would be much too 
     overpowering.

          JAKE
     Yeah, overpowering. That was the 
     word I was looking for.

          MARY
          (sensing his ploy)
     Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the 
     color scheme for weeks. I think it's 
     just right.

          JAKE
     What's that shade of blue called?

          MARY
     Pavonine. It's the same tint as the 
     stripe in the fabric.

Jake bends down and examines the chair.

          JAKE
     Are you still going with that fella 
     that teaches at Grand Valley?

          MARY
     Sam?

          JAKE
     Yeah. He's a nice guy. Don't lose 
     him. Maybe we could tone down this 
     stripe a bit. It's a little...

          MARY
          (catching on)
     Overpowering?

          JAKE
     Yeah.

          MARY
          (gives in)
     Okay, Mr. Van Dorn, I think we could 
     knock that Pavonine blue a bit.

          JAKE
     Are you sure it's all right?

          MARY
     Yes. I think it'll look better.

          JAKE
     If you say so.

Mary watches him a moment and thinks.

          MARY
     Kristen went on that convention today, 
     didn't she?

          JAKE
          (mildly surprised)
     Yeah. How did you know?

INT. JAKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Jake lies in bed, sleeping. Blue light falls across his face. 
He is dreaming.

EXT. BELLFLOWER CHURCH - DAY

A row of church buses are parked in the lot of First Christian 
Reformed Church, Bellflower, California.

They have come from the various other Christian Reformed 
communities around the country: Zeeland, Michigan, Midland 
Park, New Jersey, Sioux Center, Iowa, Ripon, California.

Clusters of youths sit on the church steps and spacious lawns.

                                   CUT TO:

INT. MEETING ROOM - DAY

A hand-lettered poster on an easel reads: "Today's Topic: 
Doctrine -- Relevant or Old-Fashioned?"

A slight, pretty GIRL about fifteen stands up before the 
discussion group. She wears an Elton John T-shirt and name 
tag. She holds her Bible with both hands.

          GIRL
     Even though the doctrinal standards 
     were written a long time ago, I think 
     they are more relevant than ever. 
     Especially in this age of 
     permissiveness and "anything goes..."

                                   CUT TO:

EXT. BELLFLOWER CHURCH - DAY

Kristen and Marsha stand near a tree. Kristen is wearing her 
red sweater and jeans.

Nearby, a group of boys sit in a circle on the grass telling 
jokes and listening to metal rock on a transistor radio.

          KRISTEN
     You going to Knott's Berry Farm with 
     him?

          MARSHA
     He asked me. You going with anybody?

          KRISTEN
          (shrugs)
     I don't know.

          MARSHA
     You ever play Chicken?

          KRISTEN
     What's that?

          MARSHA
          (teasing)
     You never heard of that?

          KRISTEN
     Com'on, tell me.

          MARSHA
     Well, a boy goes like this, see.

Using her finger, Marsha traces a looping oval around 
Kristen's right breast, starting at the neck, working down 
to the midriff, and back up her left side.

          KRISTEN
     What does that do?

          MARSHA
     Well, each time he comes in closer, 
     like this.

Marsha traces another circle inside the first one. She draws 
a narrowing spiral around Kristen's breast.

          MARSHA
          (continuing)
     He keeps coming closer until you say 
     "Chicken." Then he stops.

The girls giggle.

          KRISTEN
     You and Jerry do that?

Mrs. Steensma steps out onto the lawn and calls to Kristen 
and Marsha:

          MRS. STEENSMA
     Kristen, Marsha! Time for your 
     discussion group.

          MARSHA
          (grudgingly)
     Oh, all right.

          MRS. STEENSMA
     And put your name tags back on.

The girls pull their name tags out of their jeans and clip 
them on as they walk back toward the church.

                                   CUT TO:

INT. TWELFTH STREET CHURCH

REVEREND VANTIL, a stately man about fifty, stands at the 
pulpit. The front of the church is plain and stark, adorned 
only by a large wooden cross.

The Christian Reformed Church is not one which believes in 
emotional appeals or confessions. It is a religion of 
scripture, creed and doctrine. Reverend Vantil, dressed in 
black, addresses the congregation as if he were a businessman. 
And his business is sin, guilt and redemption.

He speaks calmly and powerfully. The church echoes with the 
weight of his words:

          REV. VANTIL
     ...our study of the Heidelberg 
     Catechism, reading today Lords Day 
     number one, question and answer one 
     and two:
          (reads)
     Q: What is your only comfort in life 
     and death? A: That I, body and soul, 
     both in life and death, am not my 
     own but belong unto my faithful Savior 
     Jesus Christ. Q: How many things are 
     necessary to know to live and die 
     happily? A: Three: the first, how 
     great my sin and misery are; the 
     second, how I am delivered from all 
     my sin and misery; the third, how I 
     am to be thankful to God for such 
     deliverance.

Later. The CAMERA TRACKS UP the aisle as the congregation 
rises to sing the doxology. Jake stands with his sister and 
brother-in-law.

INT. DE JONG HOME - DAY

Jake, Wes, Anne and Harold Jay pass dishes around the De 
Jong's dining room.

          ANNE
     ...as soon as the service starts, 
     the ushers all go off to Big Boy's 
     and have coffee...

The PHONE RINGS.

          ANNE
          (continuing)
     I'll get it.
          (gets up)
     So that when someone like Mrs. Van 
     Dorn in a wheelchair needs some help 
     there's nobody there.

She walks into the living room. After a moment, Anne walks 
back into the room.

          ANNE
          (continuing)
     It's for you, Jake.

Van Dorn excuses himself, walks into the living room and 
answers the phone. His VOICE can be HEARD in the background

          ANNE
          (continuing)
     Well, I just hope I don't get old 
     and in a wheelchair and have to depend 
     on the ushers to help me out of 
     church.
          (to Harold Jay)
     You would never let that happen to 
     your mother, would you?

Harold Jay nods and keeps eating. He's used to this.

A moment later, Jake, his face drained of color, walks back 
into the room.

          WES
     What is it, Jake?

          JAKE
     Wes, Anne, come here a moment.

Wes and Anne step into the living room.

          JAKE
     That was Mrs. Steensma calling from 
     California.
          (a beat)
     Kristen's disappeared.

          ANNE
     Kristen?

          WES
     What happened?

          JAKE
     They don't know. They were having 
     some recreation deal out at Knott's 
     Berry Farm and Kristen wasn't there 
     when they got back to the bus and 
     they couldn't find her.

          ANNE
     Have they called the police?

          JAKE
     Yeah.

          WES
     Is Marsha there?

          JAKE
     Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going 
     to fly out today. They want me to 
     bring some pictures.

          WES
     I'll come with you. Let me pack some 
     things.

He starts to walk away.

INT. BELLFLOWER HOME - DAY

Jake and Wes sit near Marsha. Mrs. Steensma stands nearby.

          MARSHA
     ...They have a ride called "The Great 
     White Knuckler", a roller coaster. 
     Last time I saw Kristen was standing 
     over there...

          WES
     Why was she alone?

He looks at Mrs. Steensma. Marsha is hiding something: She 
was off necking when Kristen disappeared.

          JAKE
     Was she alone?

          MARSHA
     I told this to the policeman.

          MRS. STEENSMA
     They had met an older boy earlier.

          MARSHA
     But she wasn't with him when I saw 
     her last.

          MRS. STEENSMA
     She tried to give the officers a 
     description. It was nothing out of 
     the ordinary.

INT. L.A. POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY

DETECTIVE BURROWS, of Missing Persons, carries Kristen's 
picture and a form Jake has filled out into the "Runaway 
Room". Jake and Wes follow.

One long wall is covered with tacked-up snapshots of persons 
(mostly young) the police are looking for. Each snapshot is 
attached to a small form listing the missing person's name, 
age, home and so forth. A sign above the photo montage reads: 
"Have you seen this person?"

Burrows tacks up Kristen's picture on the Missing Persons 
wall.

          BURROWS
     The boy your daughter was talking to 
     didn't work at the park. We've 
     interviewed everybody there.

          JAKE
     But is she, has...

          BURROWS
     There's no evidence of any foul play 
     at present. I hope she's just a 
     runaway.

          JAKE
     There's something wrong here. Kristen 
     is not the type of girl to just up 
     and leave.

          BURROWS
     I said I hope she's a runaway. Better 
     that than she just disappears like 
     so many others do. Sometimes they 
     turn up years later, sometimes not. 
     A lot of crimes go unreported, 
     unknown. These are realities.

          JAKE
     What are you doing?

          BURROWS
     Two officers have been assigned to 
     the case. I can't keep them on 
     indefinitely, but we'll go through 
     every lead.

EXT. DOWNTOWN - DAY

Another day, Jake and Wes, wearing different clothes, walk 
with ANDY MAST, a private investigator, down an L.A. street.

They walk silently, Mast, forty, a stocky man in a wrinkled 
suit, looks like he's been up all night. He probably has.

Mast motions to a coffee shop and they enter.

                                   CUT TO:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Mast, slouching in the booth, sips his coffee.

          MAST
     Those cops, like all cops, are 
     intelligent enough, but they are 
     masters of de-ductive reason. That 
     is, you ask them what three and two 
     are they'll tell you five, but if 
     you ask them what five is, they go 
     blank. That's spec-u-lative reasoning, 
     and that's where I come in.

          JAKE
     Well, what do they know?

          MAST
     Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.

          JAKE
     So then, Mr. Mast...

          MAST
     Andy.

          JAKE
     ...What do you have to offer?

          MAST
     Let me ask you a personal question, 
     a painful one. The first of many. 
     Tell me, was your daughter the kind 
     of girl to run around, to, ah, play 
     practical jokes, maybe?

Van Dorn answers him with a cold stare.

          MAST
          (continuing)
     No, I didn't think she was. Let me 
     get the picture here. Let me guess. 
     She was an absolutely clean girl, a 
     model daughter, she never had 
     rebellious or impure thoughts, she 
     didn't fuck around...

          JAKE
     If I was you, Mr. Mast, I'd watch my 
     language.

          MAST
     Hey, I'm a private detective, Van 
     Dorn, you want to hire a choir boy 
     you can go back to Grand Rapids. 
     I've been to that scumbag town. It's 
     full of them.

          JAKE
          (cold)
     Who's paying you?

          MAST
     You are.

          JAKE
     That's right.

          MAST
          (backtracks)
     As I was saying, I'll pick up the 
     thread. There's a number of ways I 
     can go. There's not much you can do 
     here. Stay if you want. Maybe it'd 
     be better if you went back home. Go 
     through Kristen's personal stuff. 
     Ask around, maybe she knew somebody 
     out here.
          (a beat)
     Look, I do this a lot. I work at a 
     minimum rate of $750.00 a week. It 
     may seem like a lot of money to you, 
     but it ain't. You could hire cheaper.

          JAKE
     And better?

          MAST
     I suppose. But I'll tell you, Jake, 
     I'm like a little animal. When I get 
     my teeth into something I never let 
     go. If your daughter's here, I'll 
     track her down.

bureau. The room is unchanged.

-- Jake, his arms folded, stands outside church. A fellow 
parishioner is speaking to him; Jake doesn't seem to be 
listening.

Mast's VOICE comes over a long distance connection:

     Pilgrim, this is Andy. I'm in Phoenix.

     Yeah, it looks that way. I don't

-- Jake gets out of his car and looks down the street of a 
strange town. A nearby sign reads: Minneapolis National Trust.

-- Jake walks into a greasy spoon. Ahead of him, her back 
turned, sits a girl who looks like Kristen. She turns as he 
approaches; it is another girl, another runaway. He apologizes 
and walks away.

OVER this SCENE, we HEAR Van Dorn's telephoned VOICE:

          JAKE (V.O.)
     No, I was up in Minneapolis. Somebody 
     responded to my ad. Said there was a 
     girl who looked like Kristen there. 
     But it wasn't her. The police haven't 
     found anything?

          MAST (V.O.)
     I took a side trip to Mexico City.

          (sets down plate)
     Spring's early. Without a frost we'll 
     have a good year.

          WES
     Not as good as last.

          JOHN
     Lord's been good to us.

Across the street, two junior high boys, pushing their bikes, 
follow two female classmates. The girls dressed in tight 
halters and shorts try to ignore them.

          JOE
     Never had to make a dishonest dollar 
     in my life. Never cheated an employee.

          WES
     How could you? They're all your 
     relatives.

He laughs.

          JOE
     The Lord got his share, too.

Joe gets up to refill his coffee cup. Wes turns to Jake, who 
is watching the couples across the street.

     How's your business, Jake?

          JAKE
          (absentminded)
     Pretty good.

          WES
     You should come around more often. 
     You haven't been around for weeks. 
     Anne complains she doesn't see you 
     anymore.

Jake, looking away, doesn't answer. Wes contemplates something 
he's been planning to say.

          WES

     You can't dwell on Kristen all the 
     time, Jake. Sometimes we can't

EXT. DOWNTOWN GRAND RAPIDS - DAY

Jake and Mast walk out of the Pantlind and walk up Monroe 
Avenue. The heart of Grand Rapids, like that of many Mid-
western cities, is a ghost town. The major businesses have 
one by one gone broke or moved out to the suburban malls, 
leaving the core of the city to cut-rate stores, parking 
lots and federally-subsidized government buildings.

          MAST
     This used to be a real city. I was 
     here about fifteen years ago. 
     Embezzlement case. It was always a 
     little religious for my taste, but 
     at least it was a city. With a 
     downtown and all.

          JAKE
     What have you found out?

          MAST
     I've got some news. Your daughter's 
     all right. At least I think she is.

          JAKE
     Where is she?

          MAST
     I don't know.

          JAKE
     What do you mean?

          MAST
     Have you ever seen any, ah, 
     pornographic movies, Jake?

          JAKE
     No.

          MAST
     Do you know what a "hardcore" movie 
     is?

          JAKE
     That's like a stag film.

          MAST
     Yeah. You ever seen any of those?

          JAKE
     No.

          MAST
     They're legal now.

          JAKE
     They are?

          MAST
     Yeah.
          (a beat)
     All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.

          JAKE
     Hmm.

          MAST
     There's a little stall theatre up 
     here.
          (gestures)
     It's closed now, but I'm borrowing 
     it for an hour. I think there's 
     something you'd better see.

INT. THEATRE - DAY

Jake is uncomfortably seated in the dingy thirty-seat theatre. 
Mast walks back from the projection booth as the film starts.

He sits next to Van Dorn. We slowly TRACK INTO Jake's face 
as the color drains from it. O.S. We HEAR groans and the 
sounds of flesh on flesh.

We TRACK SLOWLY INTO the film itself:

A 16mm hardcore short on a simple, but classic theme -- rape. 
Two young men force a young, unwilling girl to submit to 
their desires. The girl -- Kristen -- nude, tries to get out 
of a wrinkled bed but is restrained by the long arm of a 
languid, long-haired nude youth. Another young man, wearing 
only pink elastic shorts, steps into the frame and takes 
Kristen into his arms.

The quality of the action is quite low; the young men posture 
and overact in the manner of high school dramatics. 
Occasionally, the action stops while the actors receive cues 
from an off-screen director. Grunts and groans are dubbed 
into the screen action.

Only Kristen's performance lends a note of credibility to 
the proceedings. She is genuinely disoriented or frightened -- 
or both. She's not play acting.

For one frightening moment, Kristen, regaining full 
consciousness, fights back, but the youth in pink shorts 
slaps her into submission. Her eyes turn pleadingly toward 
the camera.

The first youth laughs and takes Kristen into his arms. The 
youth in the pink shorts kneels on the edge of the bed and 
instructs Kristen to remove his shorts. As she begins to do 
this, the first youth fucks her from the rear.

As the film ends, Jake sinks his head into his hands, speaking 
to himself. It's almost as if we're hearing his thoughts:

          JAKE
     It can't be. Why me? What have I 
     done?

Looking up, he says softly, then louder:

          JAKE
          (continuing)
     Turn it off.
          (a beat)
     Turn it off.
          (a beat)
     Turn it off!
          (a beat)
     Turn it off!

Only then does Jake realize that the film has already been 
shut off and he's sitting alone in the quiet theatre.

Mast stands by the exit. Jake gets up and walks toward him.

INT. LOBBY

Jake catches up with Mast in the small lobby.

          JAKE
          (aggressively)
     Where is she?

          MAST
     I don't know.

          JAKE
     Where did you get that film?

Jake backs Mast from one side of the lobby to the other.

          MAST
     I bought it at a store in L.A.

          JAKE
     Who made it?

          MAST
     I don't know.

          JAKE
     What do you mean?

Mast calms him down.

          MAST
     Wait. Slow down. A film like this, 
     16mm, cost two three hundred dollars, 
     sold outright, shown in peep machines, 
     maybe theatres, maybe not, is almost 
     impossible to track. 'Nobody' makes 
     it; 'nobody' shows it; 'nobody' sees 
     it. It's like it doesn't even exist.

          JAKE
     What's it called?

          MAST
     It was called 'Slave of Love' when I 
     bought it. Next time it's sold, it'll 
     be called something else.

          JAKE
     But the police...

          MAST
     The police? They know less than you 
     do.

          JAKE
     Do you think she's safe?

          MAST
     Yeah. Probably.

          JAKE
     You like this, don't you. Showing 
     me... this.

          MAST
     I hate it. But you gotta know, buddy.
          (thinks)
     A lot of strange things happen in 
     this world. Things you don't know 
     about in Grand Rapids. Things you 
     don't want to know about. Doors that 
     should never be opened. I've known 
     more about this sort of thing than a 
     man should. Don't ask me why.

Jake turns away.

          MAST
          (continuing)
     I'm going back to L.A. today. I'll 
     track this film down, if I can. I'll 
     find her. But I can't make any 
     promises. I don't know what she'll 
     be like when I find her.

Jake, pale, looks away. Mast attempts to give him a comforting 
embrace. Jake pushes him away.

INT. HOLLYWOOD MOTEL - DAY

A porn film is being shot in a tacky motel room furnished 
with a pink circular water bed, a lime-brown shag rug, and 
peeling red felt wallpaper. An oil painting of a seagull in 
flight adds a touch of class.

The small set is crowded with technicians and onlookers. The 
harried collegiate filmmakers wear scruffy jeans and T-shirts. 
The onlookers, more refined, sport double knit suits.

Two girls and a middle-aged man lie on the pink satin sheets. 
Beach towels protect them from the unheated water bed. One 
of the girls, NIKI, has a long blonde wig and looks about 
nineteen.

The makeup girl hurriedly dabs some last minute cosmetic on 
the second girl's breast. A young man in a UCLA T-shirt pastes 
up the peeling wallpaper above the bed.

Random VOICES ECHO around the set. The DIRECTOR, a student 
filmmaker, tries to bring the set to order.

BILL RAMADA, 40, the Producer, watches silently from the 
b.g. He's in charge here. He wears gabardine slacks and a 
Gucci shirt.

His Assistant, KURT, 25, stands by his side.

          RAMADA
          (clapping hands)
     All right, kids, let's get back to 
     it.

          DIRECTOR
     Actors, to your positions, please.

Niki, the SECOND GIRL and the Actor remove their towels and 
form a contorted triangular position.

          NIKI
     Can't you get this bed any warmer?

          CAMERAMAN
     Bring another light over here.

          NIKI
     My ass is freezing.

          ACTOR
     Your ass is always freezing.

          NIKI
     Up yours.

The Second Girl coaxes her male partner into tumescence.

          SECOND GIRL
     He's got it up.

          NIKI
     Thank God.

          DIRECTOR
     Action. Rolling.

          CAMERAMAN
     The wallpaper's peeling again.

          DIRECTOR
     Forget it. Keep shooting.

Crouching, the Director approaches his actors.

          DIRECTOR
          (continuing)
     All right, Niki, you come around 
     this way and swing your legs around 
     his back.

The Director pleads with outstretched hands. His acting 
workshop courses have not been in vain. Lowering his voice, 
he coaxes Niki into the proper mood:

          DIRECTOR
          (continuing)
     All right, Niki, you're lying back 
     now, yes, just taking it easy, just 
     enjoying your body, yes, you're 
     thinking about your father, your 
     mind is open and free...

Mast walks into the rear of the room and looks around until 
he spots Ramada.

          DIRECTOR
          (continuing)
     Okay, now Bennie, you turn over and 
     lick her belly...

Ramada recognizes Mast as he walks toward him and motions 
for him to follow.

They step into an adjoining room. The Director's instructions 
drone in the distance.

          RAMADA
          (friendly)
     Hey, piss-head, what brings you 
     around?

          MAST
     You don't have to get uppity with 
     me, Bill. I remember when you was 
     running that car wash and couldn't 
     make it go. And what was that other 
     thing you tried? A Dairy Queen? Went 
     busted too.

          RAMADA
     At least I improved myself. What's 
     up?

Mast takes out a snapshot of Kristen. In the background the 
Director yells, "Cut."

          MAST
     I want you to take a look at this 
     girl here. She's been in some porn 
     stuff.

          RAMADA
          (looks at photo)
     No, Andy. Don't know the kid.

          MAST
     Look again, Billy-boy. This is jail 
     bait. Could get you in a lotta 
     trouble.

          RAMADA
          (shakes head)
     Nope never saw her before.
          (calls to assistant)
     Kurt, come over here. Don't use 
     underage kids. Wouldn't touch 'em 
     for all the cow shit in Mexico.
          (as Kurt steps over)
     You recognize this piece of wool, 
     Kurt?

          KURT
          (shakes head)
     No.

          RAMADA
     Sorry couldn't help you, Andy.
          (to Kurt)
     How'd the shot go? They about ready 
     to start again?
          (to Mast)
     You can come watch if you want, Andy. 
     Just don't hassle anybody.

Mast shrugs, tucks the photo in his pocket and follows Ramada 
and Kurt back onto the set.

INT. BEDROOM - DAY

Jake walks into his bedroom, pulls a suitcase out of the

He is motivated now. A decision has been made.

He throws in his shirts and socks. A travel clock. Pictures

     No, I don't know when I'll be back.

EXT. HOLIDAY INN - DAY

Van Dorn, dressed and ready to go, walks out of the Hollywood 
Holiday Inn and over to the parking lot.

Checking a city map one final time, he gets into his late 
model rented green Pontiac and drives off.

                                   CUT TO:

INT. CAR - DAY

Jake seems a new man; he's in charge now. To a man like Jake 
Van Dorn, a man from the Midwest, a self-made man, all is 
possible once you're in control. There are no ambiguities, 
no conundrums, no labyrinths; only problems. And problems, 
once understood, lead only to solutions.

All one needs is the will and the intellect to pursue those 
solutions.

Jake looks at the note pad on the seat. It reads:

Andy Mast 
Apt. #3-A 
14316 Chandler Blvd., 
Van Nuys, Calif. 
(213) 474-8759

He drives up Highland, past the freeway and over the hills.

EXT. MAST'S APARTMENT - DAY

Van Dorn parks in front of the Elite V Apartments.

Jake stops in front of the room, re-checks the number, and 
knocks.

There's no immediate answer. Hearing some commotion in the 
room, Jake stops, listens. He peeks through the partially-
curtained window.

Inside, he sees Mast banging away with a TEENAGE GIRL on the 
sofa.

Jake is curious, then outraged. He tries the door. It opens.

Inside, Mast and his teenage companion scramble for their 
clothes. The girl calls out.

          TEENAGE GIRL (O.S.)
     It's the cops, man.

          MAST (O.S.)
     Fuck.

INT. MAST'S APARTMENT - DAY

Jake strides into Mast's apartment.

Mast, his belt unbuckled, puts on his shirt. The Teenage 
Girl, pulling a Grateful Dead T-shirt over her head, looks 
at Jake and says:

          TEENAGE GIRL
     Who the fuck is this?

Not pausing to speak, Jake pushes Mast against the sofa. 
Reaching down, he pulls the detective up by the collar.

          JAKE
     What are you doing? You son-of-a-
     bitch! I've been paying you every 
     week for three months and you've 
     been out here...

          TEENAGE GIRL
     I'm splitting.

Jake turns as the girl vanishes.

          MAST
     I ain't cheated you, Pilgrim. This 
     is research, damn it! That girl could 
     have told us something.

          JAKE
     Research, my ass. I suppose these 
     are the 'extra expenses' I've been 
     paying for? And in the middle of the 
     morning, too.

Mast pulls himself away.

          MAST
     Oh, fuck off. You should stay where 
     you belong.

          JAKE
     Get out. Get out of here, Goddammit.

Mast picks up his shoes and says half-apologetically:

          MAST
     I'm only human, you know.

          JAKE
     Get out.

          MAST
     But this is my apartment.

          JAKE
     Get out!

Mast shrugs. There's no reasoning with Van Dorn. He pauses 
at the door and looks back.

          MAST
     You prick. You ass-hole prick. You 
     can find your own Goddamn daughter 
     now.
          (stops; looks at door)
     I'm not even smart enough to lock my 
     own fucking door.

Mast closes the door behind him. Van Dorn looks around the 
apartment. It's calm now.

On the desk are Mast's briefcase and papers.

Looking through Mast's files, Jake finds pages and pages of 
notes and information about his daughter's disappearance. 
Names, places, dates. Lists of massage parlors, sex shops, 
porn bookshops. The names of owners, managers, filmmakers, 
Interviews with street girls, cops, landlords.

Plus snapshots of Kristen as she once was and 8x10 frame 
enlargements from "Slave of Love," her hardcore film.

INT. HOLIDAY INN ROOM - DAY

Jake has spread Mast's papers and photographs across the 
floor of his Holiday Inn motel room.

His collar open, his tie loosened, Van Dorn squats over the 
notes and interviews. He studies his find. It includes:

-- sex ads from various local papers. Some are crossed out, 
others circled, others checked.

-- a list of massage parlors and sex shops under the heading 
"possible K was here."

-- An L.A. Times newspaper clipping about "Bill Ramada, L.A. 
Porn Movie Mogul." It features a photo of Ramada on his way 
out of court.

-- a sleazy porn mag article about "Parlor Girls: Hustling 
and Loving."

EXT. LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

Van Dorn drives through the crowded streets of Los Angeles' 
tenderloin. He cruises down Santa Monica, up Western, along 
Hollywood and back down to Santa Monica.

He passes row upon row of garish adult bookstores, massage 
parlors and porn theatres. He passes model shops, topless 
bars, "erotic motels," and peep shows.

Teenage girls stand in the red neon shadows, calling out to 
passing strangers. Drag queens and leather boys cruise the 
sidewalks. Jet black pimps, sporting high heels and make 
coats, stroll from one massage parlor to another. The sound 
of Latin jazz comes from one doorway; soul disco from another. 
L.A.P.D. black and whites patrol the streets. Occasionally, 
a uniformed officer leans out to hassle a passing pimp or 
hooker.

He drives on. The sex shops have names like "The Sexual 
Catharthis Center," "Pandora's Box," "The Institute of Oral 
Love," "69 Club," "The Church of Spiritual Sexuality," "The 
Participating Center of Sexual Experience," "Mother's Fun 
Palace," "The Hot Box."

A zoo of lusts.

Jake looks at the seat beside him, checking Mast's list of 
massage parlors and sex stores with the notation, "possible 
K was here."

EXT. ADONIS BOOKSHOP - NIGHT

Van Dorn pulls to the curb and parks his car. Ahead is the 
plexiglass lettered sign of the Adonis bookstore.

Jake locks his car, buttons his suit coat and walks toward 
the bookstore. He hesitates a moment, then enters.

                                   CUT TO:

INT. ADONIS BOOKSHOP - NIGHT

Jake steps into the bookstore and looks cautiously from side 
to side.

His expression is stern, withdrawn, as if suppressing some 
physical pain. He finds nothing titillating about this world; 
for him it is simply evil. Neither is he shocked. Has he not 
been taught: "For every imagination of man's heart is only 
evil continually"?

An improbable assortment of men peruse the long racks of 
pornographic books and magazines. A young MALE TELLER sits 
next to a cash register atop a high counter. Below him, a 
display case features sexual paraphernalia and films. A small 
radio softly plays Muzak.

          TELLER
     Fifty cents admission.

          JAKE
     What?

          TELLER
     It's fifty cents admission. It's 
     applicable to a purchase.

Jake fishes in his pocket, comes up with a couple quarters 
and places them on the counter. The Teller gives him a token 
in return.

Van Dorn walks down one row and up another. The explicit 
titles and magazine covers leap out at him: "Cropped 
Crotches," "Teenage Obedience Lesson," "Mouthful of Cock," 
"Hogtie." Many of the magazine covers feature obviously 
underage girls. He eases his way past a butch young man 
looking at magazines in the gay section.

Screwing up his courage, Jake steps back to the counter.

He tries but cannot avert his eyes from the grotesque sexual 
novelties in the case. Dildos, some small, some huge and 
gross, looking more like instruments of torture than pleasure. 
Stimulators, vibrators, spiked ticklers. Penis enlargers. 
Leather paddles, whips, masks, rubber vaginas, fuck faces, 
masturbators.

          JAKE
     Do you have a, ah, film called 'Slave 
     of Love?'

          TELLER
     What we got is just these here.
          (gestures)
     What you see.

          JAKE
     It's a short film.

          TELLER
     They're all about the same. You want 
     something?

Jake looks momentarily at the boxes of 16mm film. A couple 
titles read "Office Party," and "Butt Banger."

          JAKE
     Well...

Van Dorn pulls a folded 8x10 out of his vest pocket. It's a 
glossy frame enlargement from "Slave of Love" folded to reveal 
only Kristen.

          JAKE
     This is from the movie I was talking 
     about.

          TELLER
     I don't know what you're talking 
     about.

          JAKE
     I wondered if you had ever seen this 
     film or this woman...
          (points)
     ...right here.

          TELLER
     That girl? No, never saw her. I don't 
     know anybody.

          JAKE
     I'm just trying to find...
          (getting testy)
     Who owns this store?

          TELLER
     I don't know. Look, man, if you're 
     looking for somebody maybe you ought 
     to see the cops.

          JAKE
     But I...

          TELLER
     I don't know nothing, man.

Jake, realizing he's getting nowhere, pockets his photograph 
and turns to leave.

          TELLER
          (continuing)
     You don't want anything for your 
     fifty cents?

          JAKE
     No.

The Teller places two quarters on the counter.

          TELLER
     Here. Take your fifty cents back.

          JAKE
     That's all right.

          TELLER
     No, take it. I don't want your Goddamn 
     fifty cents.

Jake places the token on the counter, takes his quarters and 
walks back out into the neon night. The Teller turns to no 
one in particular and says:

          TELLER
          (continuing)
     It's one of those Legion of Decency 
     guys.

EXT. WILD MARY'S - NIGHT

Van Dorn walks west on Santa Monica Boulevard. The entrance 
to Wild Mary's is formed by the larger-than-life painted 
rear view of a bent over woman. Her long legs flank either 
side of the open passageway.

A young man in a cowboy shirt repeats monotoned litany to 
passersby:

          CALIFORNIA COWBOY
     Free information. Free information 
     inside. Come in and get free 
     information. Free information. Free 
     information inside.

Jake pauses in front of the California Cowboy, then enters, 
passing through Wild Mary's muscled thighs.

INT. WILD MARY'S - NIGHT

Jake walks into Wild Mary's and is greeted by a young woman 
in a shift and bikini pants. Her name is BEATRICE.

          BEATRICE
     Hello. My name is Beatrice. Have you 
     been here before?

          JAKE
     No.

          BEATRICE
     What we offer here is nude body to 
     body contact on a bed in a private 
     room. It's twenty dollars a half 
     hour, thirty dollars an hour. Anything 
     else you desire may be discussed in 
     the privacy of your room. Tips are 
     allowed. We accept Bank Americard, 
     Master Charge and American Express.

          JAKE
     I don't really want... 'body to body 
     contact.'

          BEATRICE
     That you may discuss with the girl 
     of your choice in the privacy of 
     your room.

A SECOND TEENAGE HOSTESS steps through a beaded curtain and 
joins Beatrice and Jake.

          SECOND HOSTESS
     Hi.

          JAKE
     I'm looking for a girl. Have you 
     ever been in a porno film?

Jake reaches for this folded photo but the Second Hostess 
takes him by the hand.

          SECOND HOSTESS
     Come back with me. I'm sure you'll 
     find what you want.

A THIN MAN walks into the room. He looks about 35 and carries 
a small bag.

          THIN MAN
     I called on the phone. You have a 
     Domination Room?

          BEATRICE
     Yeah. Did you bring your own 
     domination equipment?

          THIN MAN
     Yes, but I've never been here before.

          BEATRICE
     I'm sure everything will be just the 
     way you want it. Twenty dollars half 
     hour, thirty dollars hour. Tips are 
     allowed.

          THIN MAN
     Let's start with a half hour.

The Thin Man gives Beatrice a twenty and walks off with her. 
Jake, curious, follows.

Beatrice and the Thin Man step into the Domination Room: a 
simulation of a Medieval dungeon. A large wood X-shaped cross 
is bolted to one wall. There are straps for the client's 
hands and feet. Instruments of torture hang from another 
wall. A bare-breasted girl, wearing bikini pants and leather 
chaps, sits lethargically on a folding chair. A mask of black 
leather and buckles completely cover her face.

Beatrice notices Jake is following them.

          BEATRICE
     You want to take a session?

Jake is dazed by what he sees. He wasn't even aware such 
perversions existed.

          JAKE
     No. I don't think so.

          BEATRICE
     You sure? We have regular sessions, 
     too. Only twenty dollars?

Jake turns and (like Lot from Sodom) walks away without 
looking back. As he leaves, he passes the Second Hostess 
attempting to communicate with two teenage MEXICANS.

          TEENAGE MEXICAN
     Sexo?

The Second Hostess forms an oval with the index finger and 
thumb of her left hand and passes the index finger of her 
other hand through it in an obvious gesture:

          SECOND HOSTESS
     Si. Sexo. Sexo.

EXT. STAIRWAY TO LOVE - NIGHT

Later that night. Jake locks his car and walks south on 
Western toward Santa Monica Boulevard. Ahead, a continuous 
row of massage parlors blend into neon.

Girls call out as he walks: "Come on in and get free 
information," and "Want to have a good time?" and "Lonely?"

He stops by the Stairway to Love. Three girls stand just 
inside the door. A sign in the window reads: "Come in -- 
Satisfaction Here." He enters.

                                   CUT TO:

INT. STAIRWAY TO LOVE - NIGHT

The First Hostess, FELICE, greets Jake as he enters:

          FELICE
     Hi, you been here before?

The two other Hostesses gather round.

          JAKE
     No.

          FELICE
     We offer Female Wrestling, that is, 
     nude body to body contact, with a 
     girl of your choice in a private 
     room. Twenty dollars a half hour, 
     thirty dollars hour. Any other 
     arrangements may be discussed in the 
     privacy of your room. Tipping is 
     permitted. We accept Bank Americard, 
     Master Charge and American Express.

          JAKE
     Yeah.

          FELICE
     Do you want to take a session?

          JAKE
     I just want to ask some questions.

          FELICE
     You may do that in the privacy of 
     your room.

          JAKE
     Okay. I'll take a half hour.

          FELICE
     Do you have any particular choice of 
     girl?

          JAKE
     You'll be fine.

Jake gives Felice a couple tens. She in turn passes them to 
the MANAGER, a 225 pound, blond-haired Malibu surfer. He 
puts the money in a cash box and fills out a time sheet.

Jake eyes the Manager uneasily as Felice escorts him up the 
"Stairway to Love."

INT. ROOMS - NIGHT

Felice shows Jake into a ten-by-ten cubicle. The walls are 
barren; a bed-sized slab of foam rubber lies on the floor.

          FELICE
     Wait a second. I've got to get a 
     sheet.

He looks around the small room. Through the makeshift 
pasteboard walls he can hear the SOUNDS OF OTHER COUPLES 
"making love."

Felice quickly returns with a sheet and spreads it across 
the foam. She slides the door shut behind her.

          FELICE
     You're still dressed?

          JAKE
     Well, I want to...

          FELICE
          (sitting)
     Sit down. Make yourself comfortable. 
     My name's Felice.

Jake squats down on the foam, crossing his legs under him.

          JAKE
     There's a girl I want to ask you 
     about.

          FELICE
     You're not Vice, are you?
          (rote)
     Do you work for the Los Angeles Police 
     Department, or do you have any other 
     affiliation with any law enforcement 
     agency?

          JAKE
     No, I don't.

          FELICE
     I have to ask you that. If you were 
     Vice you couldn't deny it. You ought 
     to dress less square. You wouldn't 
     get hassled so much. Here, let me 
     help you get that tie off.

Felice reaches over to loosen his tie. Jake, self-conscious, 
removes his tie.

          JAKE
     Well, actually I wanted to ask about 
     this girl. I have her picture here.

          FELICE
     Pull out your cock.

          JAKE
     What?

          FELICE
     Cops aren't allowed to do that either. 
     A judge ruled that that was 
     entrapment. Don't ask me why. I guess 
     he figured the sight of a Vice 
     Officer's dong would make a girl 
     unable to stop herself.

She laughs.

          JAKE
     No, Felice, I'm not a cop. In fact, 
     right now I've got as little respect 
     for the police as you do.
          (pulls out folded 
          glossy)
     I'm looking for a girl. A runaway. I 
     need someone to help me.

          FELICE
     Are you going to stiff me?

          JAKE
     What do you mean?

          FELICE
     Look, that twenty dollars you just 
     paid, I don't get any of that. That 
     goes to the guys that own this place. 
     I get two bucks an hour, minus ten 
     percent for a bail fund. I make all 
     my money on tips.

          JAKE
     You want a tip?

          FELICE
     Sure. What do you want? Tips can be 
     anywhere from thirty dollars to 
     seventy dollars.

          JAKE
     What do you mean?

          FELICE
     What do you want to tip me for? Look, 
     you got to spell it out. Whatever 
     you want, just say it.

          JAKE
     I'll give you a tip. Here's forty 
     dollars.

Jake digs out a couple twenties and gives them to her. Felice 
tucks the bills into her bikini crotch and pulls off her 
shirt top. Her breasts seem surprisingly pale and small.

          FELICE
     Now, what do you want?

          JAKE
     I said I just wanted to talk to you...

          FELICE
     That's cool.

          JAKE
     ...about this woman.
          (showing glossy)
     I'm trying to find her. Do you know 
     her?

          FELICE
          (uptight)
     Look, I don't know anybody. I never 
     seen her before.

Jake, previously upset, is now angered. Nobody tells him 
anything, he gets nowhere.

          JAKE
     I'm getting angry.

          FELICE
     Wait a minute, that's going to cost 
     you more than forty bucks.

          JAKE
     I'm getting angry. I want some 
     answers.
          (stands)
     Where's the guy who runs this place?

He slides open the door and walks out. Felice pulls on her 
shift and follows him.

          JAKE
     Who is it? That blond guy? Where is 
     he? I'm going to talk to someone.

          FELICE
     Wait?

          JAKE
     Where is he? Where's the bastard 
     that runs this shit hole?

The Manager, as if on request, steps to the top of the stairs. 
His huge frame fills the hallway.

          MANAGER
     What do you want?

          FELICE
     He's causing trouble.

          JAKE
          (contentious)
     I got a picture here. I want you to 
     tell me where to find this woman. I 
     been asking everybody. Nobody knows 
     anything.

          MANAGER
     Calm down, mister. You don't want to 
     get the cops in here do you? You got 
     a family?

          JAKE
          (shows picture)
     I don't suppose you've ever seen 
     this girl before either? Her name's 
     Kristen, but I suppose you've never 
     seen her?

          MANAGER
     Why don't you just go outdoors, 
     mister? Cool off.

          JAKE
     Cool off, huh? How's this for cooling 
     off?

He knocks a cheap print of a naked woman off the wall. The 
frame crashes to the floor.

          MANAGER
     Hold it, mister.

          JAKE
     What do you think of that? Or this?

Jake knocks over a small table. The Manager has had enough. 
He grabs Jake's arm, wrenches it tight behind his back and 
rams Jake's face into the wall. He forces Jake down the 
stairway of love.

Jake struggles and kicks, but is no match for the larger 
man. At the foot of the stairs, the Manager ejects Jake, 
thrusting him across the sidewalk.

Jake rams face-first into a parked car. He staggers on the 
sidewalk. His mouth and nose bloody.

He looks back. A black and white slows down. There's nothing 
to be done. He moves on.

                                   CUT TO:

INT. HOLIDAY INN ROOM - DAY

Van Dorn, thinking, lies face up on the bed in his motel 
room. He wears slacks and a white undershirt.

His face is bruised, his lip is swollen. An open First Aid 
Kit sits on the lamp stand.

LATER. Jake slouches in a chair watching "Day of Discovery," 
a Sunday evening religious program. The chorus of wholesome 
young people look like they've come from another planet.

A soothing, innocuous hymn. In the distance church bells 
RING, as if signalling a call to action.

                                   CUT TO:

EXT. BEVERLY HILLS - DAY

The next day. Jake, now wearing a print sport shirt under 
his navy jacket, strides down Camden. He has a plan.

He checks an office building address and enters.

                                   CUT TO:

INT. OUTER OFFICE - DAY

Jake stands as a SECRETARY says to him:

          SECRETARY
     Mr. Ramada can see you now.

He thanks her and walks into Ramada's office.

                                   CUT TO:

INT. RAMADA'S OFFICE - DAY

Bill Ramada stands to greet Jake as he enters. His office is 
expensively decorated in chrome and glass. A framed poster 
from the New York Film Festival hangs on one wall.

Kurt sits on a plush white sofa.

          RAMADA
     Hello, Mr. Holcum. You look out of 
     breath. What's the matter? The 
     elevator broke?
          (to Kurt)
     Is the elevator broke?

Kurt shrugs.

          JAKE
     No. I walked up. Don't ride elevators.

          RAMADA
     My secretary said you wanted to 
     discuss a business proposition.

          JAKE
     Yes.
          (as Ramada sits)
     I'm interested in financing an adult 
     feature film. I was told you were 
     the man to come to.

          RAMADA
     Film making can be pretty expensive...

Jake has slipped into his business shoes. He's cool, 
confident.

          JAKE
     I've got fifty thousand dollars to 
     invest.

          RAMADA
     Oh.
          (a beat)
     Why is it that you want to get into 
     film financing?

          JAKE
     Well, Bill -- mind if I call you 
     Bill?
          (as Ramada nods)
     Let me be frank. I've made a lot of 
     money. I've got my own business in 
     Detroit. Rivets. I make rivets and 
     sell them to Fisher Body.
          (a beat)
     Well, rivets, you know, can get pretty 
     boring after a while. When my business 
     manager told me I should shelter 
     some money, I thought I'd try this.

          RAMADA
     What exactly do you have in mind?

          JAKE
     I thought I'd invest in a film. I 
     want to sort of become involved in 
     the process of making a film, meet 
     the people who make films, learn how 
     it's done...

          RAMADA
     In other words, you want to get laid?

          JAKE
     Not exactly...

          RAMADA
     It's cool. Why do you think I got in 
     the movies? How much poon do you 
     think you get in the car wash 
     business?
          (a beat)
     Look, fifty thousand dollars buys a 
     lot of pussy. You can get your joint 
     pulled by beautiful girls every night 
     for the rest of your life for fifty 
     thousand dollars. So why fuck with 
     the movie business?

          JAKE
          (smiles knowingly)
     It's an investment.

          RAMADA
     If you want to watch when we shoot a 
     film, for fifty bucks, I let guys 
     stand around and watch. It's a lot 
     cheaper.

          JAKE
     I thought you were a businessman.

          RAMADA
     Don't get me wrong. A couple years 
     ago, I woulda jumped at fifty thousand 
     dollars possible financing. But the 
     Lord's been good to me. I can now 
     finance any films I choose. Big ones, 
     small ones. Right now we're setting 
     up a two hundred thousand dollar 
     feature film. Live sound. I like to 
     keep my own money in my films. That 
     way you don't have to share the 
     profits. There's plenty of guys in 
     town that'll take it, though. But if 
     I was you, Mr... what was your name 
     again?

          JAKE
     Jake.

          RAMADA
     ...I'd just start my own business. 
     That's what I did. Get into kid porn. 
     That's big now. Why don't you come 
     around the set? Meet some people. If 
     you still want to invest, I'll ask 
     around.

          JAKE
     Sounds all right.

          RAMADA
     Okay. Keep in touch with my secretary.

Jake nods and turns to exit.

          RAMADA
     So long, Mr. Jake.

INT. L.A. FREE PRESS

The next day, Van Dorn waits in line to place a "Personals" 
ad in the Los Angeles Free Press.

He wears an open sport shirt, slacks and loafers. Bit by bit 
he's been going native. He realizes he isn't going to 
infiltrate the pornography underworld looking like a furniture 
dealer from Grand Rapids.

Even so, Jake's conventional dress sets him apart from his 
fellow advertisers. The long line winds back and forth and 
represents just about every possible deviation from the 
American heterosexual norm: studs, butches, hookers, freaks, 
cultists: misfits all.

The CAMERA studies the line: an attractive boy wears a studded 
collar, a low-rider sports his colors, a diminutive girl 
waits silently in her hari-krishna robe.

The line inches forward. Behind Jake, one woman tells another 
about this great swinging party. Van Dorn takes some comfort 
in the fact that the MAN in front of him, dressed in a 
seersucker suit, looks pretty straight.

The GIRL AT THE WINDOW takes his ad:

          MAN IN SEERSUCKER SUIT
          (reading ad)
     'W/M, 35, 140 fastest tongue in west, 
     will demonstrate proficiency in all 
     dialects to females under 50. Looks 
     not imp.' That's all in caps, 'LOOKS 
     NOT IMP.' 'George Harper. P.O. Box 
     102, Alhambra, Ca., 91801.'

          GIRL AT THE WINDOW
     That's 'dial-a' what?

          MAN IN SEERSUCKER SUIT
     Di-a-lects. D-I-A-L-E-C-T-S. Like 
     talking.

The Man in the Seersucker Suit pays his fee and Jake steps 
up to the window.

          JAKE
     I'd like to place a 'Personals' ad 
     in the Free Press.

          GIRL AT THE WINDOW
     How many weeks?

          JAKE
     Just one.

          GIRL AT THE WINDOW
     The rate is a dollar per line, a 
     dollar and a half bold face.

Jake takes out a slip of paper and hands it to the Girl.

          JAKE
     I have it here. Can you take this 
     down?

The Girl takes the slip of paper and reads it back to him as 
she fills in the advertising form:

          GIRL AT THE WINDOW
     'Film Producer' -- that should be in 
     caps, bold face.

          JAKE
     Okay.

          GIRL AT THE WINDOW
     'Film Producer seeks young men, 18 
     to 25, for hardcore film. Prior film 
     experience a must. Call Jake at 
     Players Motel. 777 Vine. 463-5671.

Jake nods.

EXT. DARK ROAD - NIGHT

A small film crew sets up a shot. Ramada, Kurt, Van Dorn and 
others, standing by a trailer, watch from the b.g. Jake's 
floral rayon shirt is open to the third button.

The script evidently calls for "Dark Road -- Night" because 
that's where the gaffer is arranging lights around a parked 
red Mustang. A YOUNG ACTOR in a soldier's uniform waits in 
the car. Niki and another actress, dressed as a stewardess, 
stand on their marks near the front of the car.

Ramada and Kurt walk over to talk to the YOUNG DIRECTOR. 
Niki, finished for the moment, walks back toward the trailer.

Niki picks a heavy coat out of the trailer, and wrapping it 
around her, stands next to Jake. They watch as Ramada gives 
the Director some last minute advice.

          JAKE
     Are you the star of this picture?

          NIKI
     You kidding? Three days work. I finish 
     tonight.

          JAKE
     The other girl is the star?

          NIKI
     She thinks so.
          (a beat)
     What do you do?

          JAKE
     I work with Ramada. We're doing some 
     pictures together.

          NIKI
     Well, next time you talk to him, 
     tell him to pay his actresses more.

          DIRECTOR
          (calling)
     All right, girls, Niki! To your 
     places.

          NIKI
          (to Jake)
     Nice meeting you.

Niki throws off her coat and runs to the set. The Actor backs 
the Mustang out of CAMERA range.

There is a pause, the Director calls: "ACTION!" and the 
Mustang drives to where the two stewardesses, stranded, are 
waving for help. The cameraman pans with the Mustang. The 
Soldier opens his door, looks at the girls' car and offers 
to help.

Kurt steps over to Jake.

The Soldier, looking at the stranded stewardesses, rubs his 
inner thigh.

          KURT
          (to Jake)
     We'll come in for a closeup here.

Niki unfastens the Soldier's belt and pulls down his zipper. 
The Soldier leans against the car as Niki sinks to her knees 
and opens his trousers.

EXT. PLAYERS MOTEL - NIGHT

The Players Motel is a "specialty motel." It offers "X-rated 
movies, Closed Circuit Color TV, Water Beds." Rates are $10 
a night, or $8 for two hours.

Most clients prefer the two hour rate.

Van Dorn pulls his rented Pontiac into the lot and parks in 
the first available space.

Weary, he gets out of the car and heads for his room. He 
passes a colored whore with a towering synthetic wig.

Further down the line of rooms, Wes De Jong sits slouched in 
the front seat of his rental car, watching, waiting.

A prostitute wearing jeans and a shoulder bag, enters a 
lighted room with her trick, a construction worker. He 
unbuttons his shirt as she closes the curtains.

Wes sits up when he sees his brother-in-law shuffle past the 
rooms, take out his key and open a door.

                                   CUT TO:

INT. PLAYERS MOTEL - NIGHT

Jake, not bothering to fully shut the door, steps into the 
room, throws his key on the bed and plops down beside it. 
He's emotionally and physically exhausted.

The decor is Vegas sleaze: tinted mirrors, red shag carpets, 
felt wallpaper, pseudo-Louis Seize chairs and a plexiglass 
chandelier. The large room has, at one end, a sitting area 
with a sofa and chairs, and at the other, a water bed covered 
with a black satin sheet. A large ceiling mirror is bolted 
above the bed.

Jake, hearing a NOISE, looks up.

Wes, wearing a suit and tie, steps tentatively in. He surveys 
the tawdry room. Jake just looks away.

          WES
     What's going on, Jake?

Jake says nothing for the moment.

          WES
          (continuing)
     Jake?

          JAKE
     How did you find me?

          WES
     I called every L.A. hotel. The Holiday 
     Inn gave this as a referral number. 
     Your office said you had no business 
     in New York, so I figured you had 
     come out here.
          (looks around)
     What's happening, Jake? What are you 
     doing? Nobody's heard from you. Anne's 
     worried sick. We didn't know if you 
     were dead or alive.

Jake stands and steps over to Wes:

          JAKE
     Wes, do me a favor.

          WES
     What?

          JAKE
     Leave me alone. Go home. Go away.

Wes starts to protest.

          JAKE
          (continuing)
     Just do what I say. Don't ask.

          WES
          (insistent)
     What is going on?

          JAKE
     I think I've found a way to find 
     Kristen. I have a plan. But I have 
     to be alone.

          WES
     What plan?

          JAKE
     You don't want to know.
          (a beat; softer)
     Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.

          WES
     What will I tell the others? They 
     care about you.

          JAKE
     Tell them anything you want. Tell 
     them I'm on a vacation, a business 
     trip. Tell them I needed a rest. 
     Tell them anything, just don't tell 
     them...

Jake looks about the whorey room. His voice cracks a little.

          JAKE
          (continuing)
     ...just don't tell them about this.
          (A beat)
     Now go.

Jake escorts his brother-in-law to the door. Wes turns and 
embraces him. Jake breaks the embrace and firmly pushes Wes 
out of the room.

Jake closes and chains the door.

INT. PLAYERS MOTEL - DAY

The next morning. Jake has rearranged the furniture so that 
the sofa directly faces the door. Van Dorn, wearing a blue 
tie-dyed shirt with a sunburst on the front, sits in the 
middle of the sofa. On either side of the sofa tall thin 
lamps stand on end tables. A telephone, legal pad and travel 
clock have been placed on the coffee table. Beside Jake rests 
Mast's sheaf of notes and pictures. Behind him hangs an 
iridescent poster featuring the sex signs of the zodiac.

He waits. There is a knock at the door.

          JAKE
     Come in.

A handsome STUD, about 22, wearing tight jeans, steps 
cautiously into the room.

          STUD #1
     Jake? Mr. Holcum?

Jake checks the appointment schedule on his legal pad:

          JAKE
     Pete? Come in.

          STUD #1
          (enters)
     Yeah. Peter Long. That's the name I 
     use.

          JAKE
     We're casting male roles in an 
     explicit sex action feature. The pay 
     is $100 a day. There'll be up to two 
     weeks work. You say you've had 
     experience?

          STUD #1
     I was in the Mitchell Brothers' film, 
     'Sodom and Gomorrah.' I don't know 
     if you saw that. I played Damon, the 
     slave of the Queen of Gomorrah.

Van Dorn's pretty good at this. He's given many job interviews 
before. The phone rings and he answers.

          JAKE
     Yes, this is Jake.
          (a beat)
     We're casting right now. Have you 
     had experience in hardcore films?
          (a beat)
     I can fit you in from 4:00 - 4:15 
     today.
          (a beat)
     At the Players Motel, 777 Vine, Room 
     106.
          (a beat)
     We'll see you then.

Van Dorn hangs up and looks through his sheaf of papers. 
Pulling back a page of notes, he reveals the unfolded 8x10 
glossy from "Slave of Love." He looks at the two young men 
violating his daughter, then back up at Peter Long. Long is 
neither of the men.

          JAKE
          (continuing)
     All right, Pete. I have your exchange 
     here. If we decide to use you, we'll 
     give you a call.

Long turns and exits. Jake checks his appointment schedule 
then puts his hand to his temples. He has become the thing 
he hates most: the procurer. Self-contempt fills his face.

TIMECUT: The next interviewee stands in front of Van Dorn. 
He's a tall black man about 25. An ex-athlete.

          JAKE
     You're not exactly the type we're 
     looking for.

          BLACK STUD
          (hostile)
     You mean I'm black?

          JAKE
     No, just not the type.

          BLACK STUD
     What do you mean, not the type? Don't 
     you know who I am? I'm Big Dick Brown! 
     I've been in more porno movies than 
     you ever saw. I've worked with Harry 
     Reems. I've worked with Johnny Wad. 
     Not the type! I can come ten times a 
     day. I can keep it hard two hours at 
     a time. My cock is nine inches long.

          JAKE
     I'm sorry, Mr. Brown. I'm sure you're 
     very good, but at the moment, I've 
     got nothing for you. If something 
     comes up, we'll give you a call.

          BLACK STUD
     Shit! You just don't want to hire a 
     nigger, that's all. I knew this was 
     a scam. I shouldn'ta come.

The Black Stud turns and storms out.

TIMECUT: An angelic, muscular boy about 19 stands in front 
of Van Dorn. Jake looks weary.

          JAKE
          (tired)
     I'm sorry, but you're just not the 
     type we are looking for. We had 
     something else in mind.

          STUD #2
     Don't you want to see my stuff, man?

          JAKE
     What stuff?

          STUD #2
          (pointing to crotch)
     You know, my stuff!

Jake nods with resignation.

The boy drops his jeans. Framed by firm, smooth, naked thighs, 
Van Dorn looks at the angelic boy's "stuff." He nods.

TIMECUT: It's the end of the day. The last orange rays of 
sun come through the window.

Jake, weary, looks up. A young man steps in from the fading 
sunlight.

The young man looks about 21. His sun-bleached hair falls 
just to his shoulders. A hippie who's hit the streets.

Jake looks at his 8x10 glossy, then back at the young man. 
This is him. This is the young man in the pink bikini shorts.

This is the YOUTH from Kristen's hardcore movie, the one who 
slapped her, the one who forced her face into his crotch.

          JISM JIM
     Hey man.

          JAKE
     We're casting for an explicit sex 
     action feature...

          JISM JIM
          (initially hostile)
     I know. Word's out on the street -- 
     word's also out you ain't really 
     hiring anyone.

          JAKE
     That's not true, Mr...?

          JISM JIM
     Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me 
     Jism Jim.

          JAKE
     That's not true, Jim. In fact, I 
     think you're very close to the type 
     we're looking for.

Jim immediately becomes more compliant.

          JISM JIM
     Oh yeah? I've done a lot of good 
     stuff. Shorts, features. No major 
     roles it's true. But good stuff.

          JAKE
     That's what I wanted to talk to you 
     about.

Jake reaches over and picks up the glossy.

          JAKE
     I've seen you in some stuff. I like 
     your looks. I particularly liked you 
     in this film.

Jake shows him the glossy.

          JISM JIM
     Oh yeah? I remember that. It was 
     made by some college kids.

          JAKE
     It was called 'Slave of Love.'

          JISM JIM
     God, I don't know what it was called. 
     I never saw it. I only got twenty-
     five bucks for the whole Goddamned 
     thing.

          JAKE
     I thought you were quite good in it. 
     I also like the girl in it. Really 
     thought she was good.
          (points out Kristen)
     I wondered if she was still around. 
     If she was still working.

Jim examines Kristen's picture. His expression sours.

          JISM JIM
     Wait.
          (a beat)
     Wait a minute. Look, I need the work 
     and I want to be in your picture, 
     but that is one bitch I will never 
     work with again.

Jim, nervous, paces around. He tries to explain.

          JISM JIM
          (continuing)
     Look, that was one freaky bitch, one 
     very, very freaky bitch. I don't 
     know what she was into, I don't know 
     what she was on, but I don't want to 
     have anything to do with her again.

Jake's face grows cold and mean as he listens to Jim's 
description of his daughter's defilement.

          JISM JIM
          (cups genitals with 
          right hand)
     Do you know what she did to me? Do 
     you know what she did to me, man? 
     That fucking cunt! I couldn't walk 
     for a week. My prick was sore and 
     red and chewed out. She was cra-zy. 
     I don't want to work with her again.

All the while Jim speaks, Van Dorn's long arm reaches slowly 
for the lamp on his right.

His right hand locks around the base of the lamp. Still 
listening, watching Jim intensely, Jake grips the balls of 
his feet into the carpet.

Jake is beyond logic, beyond restraint.

He rises, lamp in hand. The cord pops out of the wall; the 
bulb flashes out.

Reaching across the table, Van Dorn smashes the youth across 
the face. The plaster lamp shatters; the shade flies off. 
Jim reels backward.

Knocking over the coffee table, Van Dorn advances on the 
dazed, bleeding youth.

Van Dorn pounds him again with the plaster stump of the lamp.

Van Dorn stops. He looks down at Jism Jim. The youth is barely 
conscious.

Realizing what he's done, Jake pulls Jim up by his collar 
and drags him into the bathroom.

He hauls the youth into the large "erotic" shower. He pulls 
the shower douche off the wall, and sprays Jim's face.

The battered youth opens his eyes. He's terrified. He's been 
in kinky scenes before. He pleads:

          JISM JIM
     Hey, stop, stop. I'll do anything 
     you want. It's okay. I can dig it. 
     You can do anything you want to me.

          JAKE
          (full of rage)
     Where is she? Where is the girl?

          JISM JIM
     She's got a man. A white guy. Tod 
     something or other.

          JAKE
     Where does he hang out?

          JISM JIM
     I don't know.

          JAKE
     Where!

          JISM JIM
     Look, I know this chick Niki. She 
     works at Les Girls. She would know. 
     Honest.

Van Dorn lets him go and starts to walk away. Looking back, 
he sees Jism Jim struggling to his feet. Jake spins around 
and punches him once more. Jism Jim tumbles back into his 
shower. Jake walks off rubbing his red knuckles.

                                   CUT TO:

EXT. PLAYERS MOTEL - NIGHT

Jake throws his luggage into the trunk of his car and drives 
off.

                                   CUT TO:

EXT. LES GIRLS - NIGHT

Les Girls, a garish sexual supermarket, covers several 
storefronts. Its fluorescent exterior stands open to drifters 
and browsers alike.

Jake straightens his tie-dye shirt, and enters.

                                   CUT TO:

INT. LES GIRLS - NIGHT

Inside Les Girls is a glow of yellow and orange plexiglass. 
The bright fluorescents bounce off the white linoleum.

Jake passes an arcade of peep shows and turns the corner.

On one side is a rotunda around which men stand in pay stalls 
watching a pair of naked female dancers.

On the other side is a row of curtained "phone booths."

Jake walks up to a WOMAN with a coin changer around her waist. 
A lifer.

          JAKE
     I was told to meet a girl named Niki 
     here.

          LES GIRLS WOMAN
     In one of the booths. Any of the 
     first three.

Jake starts over.

          LES GIRLS WOMAN
          (continuing)
     It's five dollars for two minutes.

          JAKE
     Huh?

          LES GIRLS WOMAN
     Five dollars a token.

Jake fishes in his pocket and pulls out a ten-dollar bill. 
He hands it to the woman.

          JAKE
     Here. I'll take two.

The Les Girls Woman punches out two tokens.

Jake cautiously pulls the curtain aside and steps into the 
first booth.

The booth is divided by a floor-to-top glass partition. On 
Jake's side of the partition is a pay wall phone. On the 
other is an orange folding chair.

The sign on the phone reads "One token -- two minutes." Jake 
puts a token in the phone.

Niki, the girl from Ramada's set, naked, steps into the other 
half of the booth and plops down on the chair.

          NIKI
     Hello.

Jake picks up the receiver in his half.

          JAKE
     Are you Niki?

          NIKI
     Sure. Like in Mikey and Niki. Did 
     you see that picture?

          JAKE
     No.

          NIKI
     Too bad. I wasn't in it.

Jake's eyes flash downward for a moment. No longer shocked, 
he is saddened by the demeaning vulgarity of it all.

          NIKI
          (continuing)
     It's your money. You talk.

          JAKE
     I'm making a film. Jim Sullivan's 
     going to be in it. He said you might 
     know where Tod is.

          NIKI
     Do I know you? Weren't you on the 
     set the other night? With Ramada.

          JAKE
     Yeah.

          NIKI
     You making a feature?

          JAKE
     Um-hm. Live sound.

          NIKI
     Got any parts? I'm free. Not free-
     free, but, you know, free. I don't 
     really do this.

Gestures vaguely.

          JAKE
     Jim and I have been trying to run 
     down a girl.
          (takes out glossy)
     Do you know her?

He presses the picture against the stained glass partition.

          NIKI
     Joanne?

          JAKE
     You know her?

          NIKI
     No. I saw her with Tod.

          JAKE
     Do you know where she lives?

          NIKI
     Nah.

          JAKE
     Do you know where she would be?

There is a CLICK and the phone goes dead. Niki says something 
but Jake cannot hear her. She motions to the phone as she 
gets up to leave.

Jake puts his second token in the phone and Niki sits back 
down.

          JAKE
          (continuing)
     Where is she?

          NIKI
     Tod might know.

          JAKE
     Where's he?

          NIKI
     Last I heard he went to San Diego.

          JAKE
     If we went there, would you be able 
     to find him?

          NIKI
          (eyeing him)
     You're not a film producer, are you?

          JAKE
     How much do you make a week, Niki?

Jake uses his manipulative voice, the one he might use when 
discussing a shade of blue in a convention display.

          NIKI
          (catching on)
     Are you a private detective?

          JAKE
     Something like that. How much do you 
     make?

          NIKI
     Here? What a joke. There was some 
     detective asking about that girl.

          JAKE
     Three hundred?

          NIKI
     This is just temporary. I once made 
     nine hundred in outcall.

          JAKE
     I'll give you $700 a week, cash, if 
     you help me find this girl.

          NIKI
     Up front?

          JAKE
     Half now, half later.

          NIKI
     Make it nine hundred. That was my 
     best week.

          JAKE
     Okay. My client pays for it anyway.

          NIKI
     When do we start?

          JAKE
     Tonight. When you get out, we'll go.
          (a beat)
     Why didn't you tell the other 
     detective?

          NIKI
          (shrugs)
     This is different. This is nine 
     hundred dollars.

EXT. VAN NUYS DELL - NIGHT

Wes parks in front of a Van Nuys delicatessen and walks in.

                                   CUT TO:

INT. VAN NUYS DELI - NIGHT

Wes walks into the well-lit deli and spots Andy Mast sitting 
alone with a glass and a bottle of beer.

A cross section of California types are scattered around the 
room. A JUKEBOX plays country and western.

          WES
     Mr. Mast? My name's Wes DeJong. I'm 
     Jake Van Dorn's brother-in-law. We 
     met out here a couple months ago 
     when he hired you. Your agency said 
     you might be here.

Mast motions for him to sit.

          MAST
     Ssh. I'm on a stakeout.

          WES
          (looks around)
     Oh.

Mast looks down at the beer bottle.

          MAST
     I'm staking out this beer bottle. 
     Trying to find out if I'll finish it 
     or it'll finish me.

          WES
     I'm worried about Jake.

          MAST
     I'm off that case. He fired me.

          WES
     He didn't look good at all. Something 
     strange is going on. He's got himself 
     into some trouble. He wouldn't say 
     what.

          MAST
          (lights cigarette)
     I'll tell you, that was an interesting 
     case. The Van Dorn girl. I've handled 
     runaway cases like it before. Usually 
     when you put the pressure on the 
     porn underworld for an underage kid, 
     she pops up in about a week. Everybody 
     denies ever seeing her, but there 
     she is at the airport with a prepaid 
     ticket home. Well, I put pressure on 
     all over town for this girl and it 
     stayed cold as ice. In fact, certain 
     people for this girl and -- nothing.
          (thinks)
     I guess I gave your brother-in-law 
     sort of a raw deal.

Mast spots a long-haired youth walking toward the juke box 
and calls to him:

          MAST
          (continuing)
     Hey, buddy, E-fifteen.

The kid ignores him and makes his selection: a rock song.

          WES
     I want to rehire you. To find out 
     what's happening to my brother-in-
     law.

          MAST
     I've been on another case. All day.
          (a beat)
     I suppose I can move it over. Seven 
     fifty a week, plus travel expenses.

          WES
     Do you really think Kristen is just 
     a runaway?

Mast thinks. A shadow crosses his face.

          MAST
     Maybe. Maybe not.

          WES
     I also want you to protect my brother-
     in-law.

          MAST
     Huh?

          WES
     You have to understand. He can be 
     mean, self-righteous. He had a Vishund 
     once. Loved that dog. He came home 
     one day and the dog bit him. He took 
     that dog and staked him out in the 
     back yard. It was winter. Every day 
     he came home and watched that dog 
     until he froze. He's capable of doing 
     anything.

          MAST
     To his own daughter?

          WES
     To anybody.

EXT. SAN DIEGO MOTEL - NIGHT

Jake pulls into a freeway exit motel and parks at the office.

                                   CUT TO:

INT. JAKE'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Jake's suitcase lies open on the luggage rack. He pulls off 
his tie-dyed shirt, folds it up neatly, and places it in the 
suitcase.

He sits on the edge of the bed and undoes his shoestrings. 
He removes each shoe as if it were an individual effort.

There's a KNOCK.

Jake looks through the blinds, unhooks the chain and opens 
the door.

Niki, tugging up her jeans, scuffles in.

          NIKI
     You actually paid for both these 
     rooms? I thought you were just going 
     to get a receipt for two, and kickback 
     the desk man.

Jake, awkward, puts a shirt on.

          NIKI
          (continuing)
     I thought you were going to bed?

          JAKE
     I am.

Niki is street-wise. She can instantly interpret situations 
which would stymie the average person; but, as if to balance 
this perceptivity, she is often stymied by the ordinary.

In brief: she assumes Jake is paying her $900 a week not 
only to help him but also to be his personal playmate.

          NIKI
     Do you have any pills? Any Valium, 
     Librium? You know, pimps will sell 
     Valium at fifty cents a piece. Can 
     you believe that?

Niki sits on his bed, her legs folded under her.

          NIKI
          (continuing)
     You know Valiums pick me right up? 
     Take four or five and I'm wide awake. 
     Isn't that strange? Know what puts 
     me to sleep? Coke. I think I'm really 
     fucked up.

Niki removes her sweater and starts to pull off her Rorer T-
shirt. Jake motions for her to stop.

          JAKE
     No.

          NIKI
     Huh?

          JAKE
     Niki. Calm down. Relax. Let's just 
     talk for a while. Then, later, you'll 
     go back to your room and we'll get 
     some sleep.

He sits on the bed beside her.

          NIKI
     You have anything to drink? You want 
     to go out and get something?

          JAKE
     I don't drink, but you can go out.

          NIKI
     You don't drink?

          JAKE
          (points to stomach)
     Ulcers.

Niki studies him for a moment, then says:

          NIKI
     You're not a private detective either, 
     are you?

          JAKE
     No.

          NIKI
     I didn't think so. I've fucked 
     detectives. Who are you?

          JAKE
     A friend.

          NIKI
     Of Joanne's?

          JAKE
     Yeah.
          (looks away)
     I'm her father.

          than shock)
     Jesus.

     Her name is Kristen. She disappeared 
     a couple of months ago.

          NIKI
     And your wife? Where's she?

          JAKE
     She's dead.

     Hey, don't worry about it. Your

Jake holds the door open for Niki as they enter.

The Okinawa is a credit to its namesake. A BLACK PLAYER, 
sitting at the bar, stares absently at two girls playing 
pool.

Niki, in her element, steps up to the bar.

They turn to exit.

EXT. SAN DIEGO BEACH - DAY

Jake and Niki sit at a ramshackle picnic table at a park 
overlooking the ocean. Several children play in the distance.

Niki finishes her Big Mac, crumbles the bag and throws it 
away. She unwraps a Milky Way and she finishes her fries.

Jake watches with astonishment as she chomps her way through 
a second candy bar.

          JAKE
     You really shouldn't eat like that. 
     All that sugar. It's not good for 
     you.

     At least I'm a growing person.

          NIKI
     Did you ever live in a room with six 
     people and you didn't have any money, 
     any food, any furniture? Have your

     Not very.

          NIKI
     We're just alike. You think sex is 
     so unimportant you don't do it. I 
     think sex is so unimportant I don't 
     care who I do it with.

Jake thinks. That sounds right. But it can't be right. He 
looks away, then back at her.

          JAKE
     You can never understand a person 
     like me. I am a mystery to you. A 
     middle class person, a Mid-westerner. 
     A man who doesn't pursue women. A 
     man who believes in social order. A 
     man who goes to church, believes in 
     God, and a man who, at the end of 
     his life, believes he will be 
     redeemed.

          JAKE
          (continuing)
     I don't see why I must justify myself 
     to you. I don't care about the things 
     you do. I don't care what's happening 
     in New York or Los Angeles. I don't 
     care about movies or TV. I don't 
     care who's on Johnny Carson.

          NIKI
          (incredulous)
     What do you care about?

          JAKE
          (cold)
     I care about my daughter.

INT. OKINAWA BAR - DAY

Niki and Jake stand at the counter talking with JIM RUCKER, 
an entrepreneurial type about 40.

          NIKI
     You remember me. Louise? Rhymes with 
     squeeze.

          RUCKER
          (looks, then nods)
     You working in San Diego now?

          NIKI
     I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking 
     for Tod. I heard he was around.

          RUCKER
     'Was.' He and that shitheel Ratan 
     went down to T-J. Maybe I shouldn't 
     say that. Anyway, I hear he's back 
     in Frisco now.

          NIKI
     Was he with a girl?

          RUCKER
     No.

          NIKI
     Thanks.

Niki starts to leave.

          RUCKER
     Keep in touch, baby. Got some good 
     stuff comin' up. Need you back, baby.
          (as they exit)
     And take good care of your friend 
     for me.

     Tod was.

     He was with Ratan.

     What does that mean?
          (no answer)
     What does he do?

          NIKI
     He deals in pain.

She doesn't answer.

DETECTIVE BURROWS walks back into his office. Mast, sitting 
on the edge of the desk, is waiting for him.

          BURROWS
     Apparently your friend has gone into 
     Mexico. A Border Guard responded to 
     the APB. How does it feel to have 
     the L.A.P.D. doing your work for 
     you?

          MAST
     You're going to thank me for this. 
     You know what the media's like. They 
     love this kinda shit. If that guy 
     goes off half-cocked and gets himself 
     hurt, you're going to have so much 
     bad publicity, you...

          BURROWS
          (interrupting)
     I heard you the first time. We had 
     nothing to go on with this kid. Just 
     a runaway.
          (a beat)
     Do you really think he's in danger?

          MAST
     If he has anything to say about it, 
     yeah. I've been asking a lot of 
     questions and I don't like the answers 
     I'm getting. He's made a lot of people 
     nervous, including some poor faggot 
     who thought he was going to be a 
     movie star.

          BURROWS
     We aren't gonna arrest him for that...

          MAST
          (interrupting)
     Big threat. TV would ream you.

          BURROWS
     Keep me informed of what he's up to. 
     You help me, I'll help you.

Mast nods.

INT. SAN DIEGO AIRPORT - DAY

Jake and Niki sit in a line of multi-colored plexi-glass 
chairs in the Western Terminal of the airport. Niki munches 
a pack of Chuckles while Jake, his elbows on his knees, looks 
at the floor. Niki prattles on.

          NIKI
     You know what your problem is? You're 
     a very negative person. You think 
     negatively.

Jake tries to ignore her.

          NIKI
          (continuing)
     You have to believe in something. 
     What do they believe in -- the 
     Whatjamacillit church?

          JAKE
     Christian Reformed. It's a Dutch 
     Calvinist denomination.

          NIKI
     Do they believe in reincarnation? I 
     believe in reincarnation.

          JAKE
     They believe in the 'TULIP.'

          NIKI
     What the crap?

          JAKE
          (smiles)
     It's an anagram. It comes from the 
     Canons of Dort. Every letter stands 
     for a different belief. T-U-L-I-P. 
     Like -- are you sure you're interested 
     in this?

          NIKI
     Yeah, yeah, go on.

          JAKE
     T stands for Total depravity, that 
     is, all men, through original sin, 
     are totally evil and incapable of 
     good. 'All my works are like filthy 
     rags in the sight of the Lord.'

          NIKI
     Shit.

Jake is charmed. He's never been called upon to explain his 
beliefs to someone so totally ignorant of them.

          JAKE
     Be that as it may. U is for 
     Unconditional Election. God has chosen 
     a certain number of people to be 
     saved, The Elect, and He has chosen 
     them from the beginning of time. L 
     is for Limited Atonement. Only a 
     limited number will be atoned, will 
     go to Heaven.

          NIKI
     Fuck.

          JAKE
     I can stop if you want.

          NIKI
     No, please go on.

The INTERCOM ANNOUNCES a flight: Jake listens for a moment. 
It's a flight to Mexico City.

          JAKE
     I is for Irresistible Grace. God's 
     grace cannot be resisted or denied. 
     And P is for the Perseverance of the 
     Saints. Once you are in Grace you 
     cannot fall from the number of the 
     elect. And that's the 'TULIP.'

          NIKI
     Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure 
     this out. This is like Rona Barrett. 
     Before you become saved, God already 
     knows who you are?

          JAKE
     He has to. That's Predestination. If 
     God is omniscient, if He knows 
     everything -- and He wouldn't be God 
     if He didn't -- then He must have 
     known, even before the creation of 
     the world, the names of those who 
     would be saved.

          NIKI
     So it's already worked out. The fix 
     is in?

          JAKE
     More or less.

          NIKI
     Wow. Then why be good? Either you're 
     saved or you ain't.

          JAKE
     Out of gratitude for being chosen. 
     That's where Grace comes in. God 
     first chooses you, then allows you, 
     by Grace, to choose Him of your own 
     free will.

          NIKI
          (amazed)
     You really believe all that?

          JAKE
     Yeah.
          (shrugs)
     Well, mostly.

          NIKI
     I thought I was fucked up.

          JAKE
     I'll admit it's confusing from the 
     outside. You've got to see it from 
     the inside.

          NIKI
     If you see anything from the inside 
     it makes sense. You ought to hear 
     perverts talk. A guy once almost had 
     me convinced to let his dachshund 
     fuck me.

          JAKE
     It's not quite the same thing.

          NIKI
     It doesn't make any sense to me.

     Tod'll meet you at the bookstore at

     told him you were a 'specialty' 
     customer.

          JAKE
     Why can't I meet him now?

Niki, cocky, walks next to Jake. She is in her element. She 
calls out to a pimp:

          NIKI
     I hope your prick falls off.

Jake, surprised, turns away from the pimp's cold stare.

          JAKE
     Why can't I meet him now?

Niki brazenly calls out to a strutting hooker:

     Rot in hell, honey.

     He's busy now.

     you find that out?

          NIKI
     Just a guess. Did you have it good 
     with your wife? You know, sex.

Jake resents Niki's forwardness: what business of hers is 
this?

          JAKE
     I don't blame you, Niki. Really I 
     don't. It's this culture, where 
     everything's based on sex, sold on 
     sex...
          (starts to get angry)
     ...magazines, music, TV. It's 
     destroying everything. Buy this 'cause 
     of sex, use this 'cause of sex. Kids 
     think it's normal. They think they're 
     supposed to talk dirty, wear scanty 
     clothes...

          NIKI
          (interrupting)
     Don't get upset. I lied too. I don't 
     make no five hundred dollars a week. 
     Everything I make goes to Granville.

     Granville?

          NIKI
     My man. 'Pimp.' I split 'cause he 
     don't treat me for shit. Thinks he's

     tried to take my clothes but he says, 
     'You can't take 'em 'cause they're 
     my clothes -- I bought 'em.' Yeah, 
     with my fucking money...

Jake doesn't want to get involved with Niki's problems:

          JAKE
     Look, Niki, this really isn't my 
     business. I don't know anything

     I felt like such a shit, pilgrim, 
     after what I did to you -- not that 
     I did anything wrong -- that I kept 
     investigating, poking around. There's 
     some poor s.o.b. in L.A. with his 
     face all bent out of shape who you've 
     damaged his movie career. Lucky for 
     him, people don't look at his face.

          JAKE
     Do the police want to arrest me?

          MAST
     Nah. They don't care about some faggot 
     hustler. They're more interested in 
     your daughter's health -- and yours. 
     Like I am.

          JAKE
          (disbelieving)
     Yeah, sure.

          MAST
     Listen, pilgrim, you're way out on a 
     limb here. You don't know what you're

          JAKE
     You sure as hell haven't been any 
     help.

          MAST
     I'm sorry about that. Have you found 
     anything out? You've got to tell me.

          JAKE
     Why don't you tell me something for 
     a change?

          MAST
     Like what?

     Who is Ratan?

Mast pales.

          MAST
     Where'd you hear that name?

          JAKE
     I just heard. Who is he?

Mast walks toward the swimming pool.

Mast looks at the still, blue surface of the pool. Jake steps 
beside him. A tourist passes by with his two sons. Mast 
thinks, then speaks:

          MAST
     You know, it's possible to buy 
     anything on this earth. You can buy 
     child whores, slaves. You can have 
     people raped, killed...

     such things is named Ratan. He usually 
     isn't in this country.

     How'd you hear about him?

          JAKE
     It's just a name.

     Don't do anything more. I'll find 
     out what I can.

INT. PANDORA'S BOOKS - DAY

Jake looks around.

Seeing no one he recognizes, he pays his admission fee walks 
down a rack, picks up a copy of "Hot Twat," pages through 
it.

It's been over a week since Jake first stepped into a porno 
bookstore. The change in his manner is striking. He now seems 
at ease in the endless night-world of pandering and 
pornography.

A few moments later, a long-haired man steps up behind him. 
The young man is wearing red alligator boots and a silver 
and turquoise belt -- like the man in "Slave of Love." Tod 
scrutinizes Jake a moment before speaking.

          TOD
          (under his breath)
     Hey, Jake.

Jake turns. Tod gives him some skin. Tod seems unattractive 
at first, but the longer one looks at him, the more oddly 
sensual he appears.

          TOD
          (continuing)
     I hear you got money to spend.
          (as Jake nods)
     I hear you're interested in... 
     interesting things.

     Yeah.

     Do you work for the San Francisco 
     Police Department, or do you have 
     any other affiliation with any law 
     enforcement agency?

          JAKE
     No.

          TOD
     What you got in mind?

          JAKE
     I want to meet Ratan.

          TOD
          (backs off)
     What is that? A kind of chair? I 
     never heard of no Ratan.

          JAKE
          (studying Tod)
     I was told that there were certain 
     things that only Ratan could provide.

          TOD
     You're talking about real excitement?

          JAKE
     Yeah. I heard you and Ratan just 
     came from Mexico. And that you had a 
     film of a girl being, ah you know...

          TOD
     Who told you about this?

          JAKE
     Rucker.

          TOD
     I don't know no Ratan, but I may be 
     able to help you out. It's not me, 
     of course. Just helping out a friend. 
     It'll cost you five hundred bucks 
     for a single screening.

          JAKE

     Okay.

     Meet me here today at seven o'clock. 
     With the money. Then we'll go see 
     the film.

Tod leads Jake past two girls into the back of the parlor. 
Tod smiles to one of the parlor girls and touches the other.

INT. MASSAGE PARLOR - NIGHT

Tod ushers Jake into a barren "office" in the rear of the 
parlor.

A sheet has been tacked up at one end of the office. Across 
the room, the projectionist, a boy about 15, stands next to 
a battered old 16mm silent projector.

Two other men sit in the darkened room. One looks middle-
aged and decadent; the other, about 26, wears jeans, a western 
shirt, and a beat up flight jacket. He's saved up several 
years for this.

Jake sits in an empty office chair next to the other men.

Tod nods to the boy and he starts up the projector. A grainy 
black and white image appears on the screen.

The projectionist punches a cheap cassette player which echoes 
scratchy Mexican fiesta music through the room.

It's clear why the projectionist has chosen a Latin sound 
track: the film is set up in a Tijuana flophouse.

On screen, a girl with long blonde hair and Kristen's build 
sits on the edge of a barren double bed. She wears jeans and 
a shirt. Her face is covered by a black leather mask. The 
eye slits are taped shut.

A Cerveza poster of a half-naked Mexican girl hangs on the 
wall behind her.

A young Mexican, stripped to the waist, walks over to the 
girl. Taking instructions from someone off camera, he starts 
to undress her.

The girl, unable to see her seducer, nevertheless submits to 
his desires.

Jake watches the screen from the shadows. The pale images 
flicker across a metal filing cabinet behind him. Tod slips 
out of the room.

On screen, the young Mexican has finished the girl. He turns 
to the director for further instructions.

A man wearing a white suit walks into the frame. He flashes 
a stiletto from his sleeve and stabs the young Mexican. The 
girl, not able to see what is happening, turns her head 
quizzically.

Jake watches in unbelieving horror. The young man in the 
flight jacket is calm and dispassionate.

The young Mexican falls to the floor bleeding. The man in 
the white suit bends down and wipes the stiletto on the 
Mexican's pant leg.

The man in the white suit steps over to the girl and puts 
one hand under her mask. He lifts his stiletto again. He 
rips off the mask from the girl's face; it is not Kristen.

Jake is relieved. The faces of the others are full of 
anticipation.

Jake's relief turns to horror at what he now sees. Blurred 
images reflect against the metal cabinet behind him.

INT. TRAVEL LODGE - NIGHT

Mast, waiting for Jake, talks to Niki. The TV still plays in 
the background.

          MAST
     You know Granville's looking for 
     you, Niki?

          NIKI
     My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, 
     like in Attica.

          MAST
     Granville's looking for you anyway.

          NIKI
          (arrogant)
     Who's that?

          MAST
     The guy who bought you that ring.

          NIKI
     Well, he can just fuck himself.

She pulls off her ring and starts to hand it to Mast.

          MAST
     Keep it, honey. You're gonna need 
     it. I know that boy. He can make 
     life real tough for a working girl. 
     He'll string you out again.

Gestures to his veins.

          NIKI
     You can fuck off, too.

          MAST
     You're taking a big chance.

          NIKI
     I ain't ever gonna see him again 
     anyway.

          MAST
     Oh no? What you gonna do? Get a job?

Niki, sullen, looks away. Then, defensive, she says what 
she's been thinking.

          NIKI
     Jake'll take care of me.

          MAST
     Who? Van Dorn? You must be kidding 
     yourself, honey. You think once that 
     guy finds his daughter he'll care 
     about you?

Niki looks away again.

A car pulls in front of the motel room. They both turn toward 
the door.

Jake, weary and angry, walks in out of the night. Ignoring 
Mast, he takes Niki by the arm and leads her out of earshot.

          JAKE
     Niki...

When Mast moves to overhear them, Jake turns and edges him 
toward the door.

          MAST
     What happened, pilgrim?

          JAKE
          (forceful)
     Just leave me alone.

          MAST
     But I'm here to help you...

Jake ushers Mast out the door and chains it. Mast waits 
outside as Jake returns to Niki.

          NIKI
     Did you find out where she was?

          JAKE
     Tod gave me the slip. I have to find 
     him again. Where does he live?

          NIKI
          (sensing something is 
          wrong)
     What happened?

          JAKE
          (cold)
     Where is he?

          NIKI
     I can't tell you that.

Taking Niki gently by the shoulder, Jake sits her on the 
edge of the bed. He speaks in a calm, forceful, parental 
tone:

          JAKE
     Listen, Niki. My daughter's been 
     missing five months. I've gone through 
     a lot to find out what's happened to 
     her. I just saw a girl killed. I 
     will not let Tod slip out of my hands. 
     You have to tell me where he is.

          NIKI
     But then you'll forget about me.

          JAKE
          (insistent)
     Where is he, Niki?

Jake starts to raise his hand.

          NIKI
          (relents)
     Try a place called the House of 
     Bondage. It's a plain black storefront 
     next to Jane's. There are some 
     apartments in back.

Jake stands up and, taking Niki's head in his hands, kisses 
her on the forehead.

          JAKE
     I won't forget you.

Jake turns and exits.

                                   CUT TO:

EXT. TRAVEL LODGE - NIGHT

Jake passes Mast and heads for his car. Mast restrains him.

          MAST
     What are you doing, pilgrim? Where 
     are you going?

Jake tries to push his way past Mast.

          MAST
          (continuing)
     Let me take care of this. I don't 
     want you to get hurt.

Jake pushes Mast aside. Mast continues to talk as Jake opens 
his car door and gets in.

          MAST
          (continuing)
     Don't do anything until the police 
     get there. Don't hurt that girl.

Jake turns his car and takes off. Mast hurries back into the 
motel room.

                                   CUT TO:

INT. TRAVEL LODGE - NIGHT

Mast heads immediately for the phone, talking to Niki as he 
goes:

          MAST
     You've got to tell me where he's 
     going.

Mast sits down and dials.

          MAST
          (continuing)
     Hello, police? My name's Mast. Get 
     me Joe Klein in Vice.

Mast turns to Niki:

          MAST
          (continuing; tough)
     You don't know that man. He'll hurt 
     his own fucking daughter. I've got 
     to stop him.
          (a beat)
     You know about Ratan, don't you?

Niki looks on in fear and confusion.

                                   CUT TO:

EXT. EDDY STREET - NIGHT

Van Dorn walks down the garish neon strip past "Jane's 
Pleasure House" to an unmarked black storefront. The door is 
open.

A light shines on a sign reading: "387 OPEN."

He walks in.

                                   CUT TO:

INT. HOUSE OF BONDAGE - NIGHT

As Jake steps through the barred black door, he is hit with 
a wave of familiar smells: Human sweat, blood and sexual 
fluids.

The House of Bondage specializes in the three "disciplines:" 
bondage, dominance and humiliation. It has four domination 
rooms, each decorated in a different decor -- Babylonian, 
Medieval, Louis Quatorze, prison motifs -- to satisfy a 
variety of tastes.

Two dominants, dressed in black satin pants and shirts, sit 
on the sofa. HOPE, wearing a black silver-studded collar, 
walks over to Jake. Her voice is hard:

          HOPE
     Hello. You want some information?

          JAKE
     Yeah.

          HOPE
     We offer...

          JAKE
     Yeah, yeah...

          HOPE
     ...the disciplines: bondage, 
     domination and humiliation.

          JAKE
     I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?

          HOPE
     I don't know no Tod.

          JAKE
     What girls you got here?

          HOPE
     My name is Hope. This is Faith.
          (gestures to girl on 
          sofa)
     Charity's in back.

          JAKE
     That's all you got, three girls?

          HOPE
     Man, how many girls do you need?

          JAKE
     I was told there was a real nice 
     girl here named Joanne. Quite young.

          HOPE
     That's Charity. She's out back. She'll 
     be free in half hour.

Jake pushes her aside.

The girls watch with surprise as Jake marches through the 
curtain toward the rear of the parlor.

                                   CUT TO:

INT. HOUSE OF BONDAGE - REAR - NIGHT

Jake steps down the corridor. A customer emerges from a room 
and passes him.

He slides open one door: the Medieval Dungeon is empty. He 
continues on.

He passes the Louis Quatorze Room. It, too, is empty.

Hope calls from behind Jake:

          HOPE (O.S.)
     Tod!

Tod steps into the corridor in front of Jake. Tod squints to 
recognize the intruder.

          TOD
          (suspicious)
     What do you want?
          (scrutinizes him)
     Do I know you from somewhere?

          JAKE
     I want to know where my daughter is. 
     Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's 
     with you.

          TOD
     I don't know what you're talking 
     about.

He starts to leave.

          JAKE
     The police know about Ratan. They 
     know he's here with you. They know 
     everything.

Tod is taken aback, but tries not to show it.

          TOD
     Oh, yeah? Goody for them.

Tod starts past Jake, but Jake stretches out his hand.

          TOD
          (continuing)
     Get the fuck out of here.

Tod tries to push past Van Dorn but Jake grabs his arms and 
tries to twist them. Tod breaks free and Jake smacks him 
across his forehead with his open hand.

          TOD
          (continuing)
     You wait here. I'll find out where 
     she is.

          JAKE
     You ain't goin' nowhere alone.

Jake is beyond reasoning. Tod looks around for an alternate 
route of escape.

Tod ducks into the Prison Room. Jake follows.

Vertical bars cover the grey walls. Handcuffs and chains 
hang from the bars. In the center of the room, a Harley 
Davidson "Hog" is incongruously mounted, its front wheel 
pointed skyward. Leather straps are attached to the 
handlebars.

Tod skirts the Harley and pushes it toward Jake as he enters. 
The huge 1200-pound machine crashes toward Van Dorn.

Jake jumps back as the bike bounces in front of him, then 
starts for Tod.

Lowering his shoulder, Tod smashes through the thin pasteboard 
wall. Jake, steeping over the motorcycle, pursues.

In the Louis Quatorze Room, Jake grabs Tod by the shoulders 
and spins him around. Tod swings as he turns, hitting Jake. 
Jake grabs Tod's legs as he falls.

They both crash through the next pasteboard wall into the 
Medieval Dungeon.

Tod breaks free, runs through the dungeon and bursts through 
the last pasteboard wall. Jake pulls himself to his feet and 
follows.

          JAKE
     Where is she?

Hope and Faith, standing against the wall, watch as Tod and 
Jake burst through the wall and dash out the front door.

                                   CUT TO:

EXT. O'FARRELL - NIGHT

Jake chases Tod out of the House of Bondage.

Van Dorn pushes one girl, knocks over another and catches up 
with Tod at the corner.

He tackles Tod around the waist, rams him into a building 
and turns him around.

          JAKE
     Where's Ratan?

          TOD
     Who?

Jake grabs the young man by his hair and pulls him down the 
street. Tod yelps.

          JAKE
     Ratan!

Passing a parking meter, Jake smashes Tod's head into it. 
Tod's forehead cracks into the glass.

Tod, bleeding, protests:

          TOD
     That film was a fake! Everything's 
     phony...

          JAKE
     Ratan!

When Tod doesn't immediately answer, Jake rams his skull 
into the next parking meter. Tod, bleeding, dazed, struggles 
to stay on his feet. Jake pulls him forward.

          JAKE
          (continuing)
     I know he's here!

Gripping his hair more tightly, Van Dorn drags him to the 
next parking meter and smashes his head into it.

          JAKE
          (continuing)
     Ratan!

Curious bystanders watch Jake smash the youth's bleeding 
head into the next parking meter.

          TOD
          (terrified)
     Who the fuck knows? The Four Aces. 
     He goes there.

          JAKE
     Let's go.

Van Dorn pulls Tod down the sidewalk toward the Four Aces.

                                   CUT TO:

INT. FOUR ACES - NIGHT

Van Dorn pulls the bleeding Tod into the Four Aces, a low-
life strip club.

A dozen solo patrons are scattered around the dimly lit bar. 
On stage, a couple performs a routine sex simulation act to 
a scratchy Barry White record.

                                   CUT TO:

EXT. HOUSE OF BONDAGE - NIGHT

Two police cars, dome lights flashing, pull up in front of 
the House of Bondage. Mast's car pulls up behind them.

                                   CUT TO:

INT. FOUR ACES - NIGHT

A man wearing a white suit sits at a table with several girls. 
He immediately recognizes Tod. This is RATAN. The man who 
killed the young Mexican and girl in the film.

Ratan starts to rise. Jake drops Tod and heads toward Ratan.

A girl wearing a skimpy halter stands up between Ratan and 
Jake. She turns and looks back at Jake: it is Kristen.

She is terrified. Kristen turns and runs away, stumbling 
over a chair.

Ratan rushes toward the front door.

In the same instant Jake sees Kristen falling, Ratan fleeing.

Trying to get around Jake, Ratan flashes his stiletto forward.

A gash razors across Jake's upper chest.

Ratan's stiletto flashes forward: Jake's arm is cut. Jake 
clasps Ratan and thrusts him backward.

                                   CUT TO:

EXT. FOUR ACES - NIGHT

The street fills with SIRENS, flashing light and police.

Mast rushes toward The Four Aces. Niki follows.

                                   CUT TO:

INT. FOUR ACES - NIGHT

Jake rams Ratan backward into the smoke-colored front window.

Ratan's back smashes through the plate glass. Ratan's feet 
lift off the floor as he falls backward.

Sinking backward against the broken glass, Ratan swings his 
stiletto at Jake.

Jake, protecting himself from the knife, flips Ratan over.

Ratan's chest and stomach rasp across the jagged glass.

Jake grabs Ratan's head in both his hands and forces it 
downward onto the bottom edge of the jagged window frame.

He rubs Ratan's neck across the glass: every artery, vein 
and capillary rip out of Ratan's neck.

Ratan collapses against the window frame.

TWO OFFICERS, guns drawn, rush toward Ratan's body. The Second 
Officer pulls out his handcuffs, then realizes it will not 
be needed.

Jake turns and heads toward where he last saw Kristen.

The First Officer aims his gun at Jake and calls out:

          FIRST OFFICER
     Halt!

Mast and plainclothes officer (Joe Klein), rush over and 
instruct the Officers to ease off.

Jake walks across the now empty bar. Several tables are 
overturned.

Jake walks to the table where Kristen tripped. Following her 
logical path, Jake walks into the women's rest room.

                                   CUT TO:

INT. REST ROOM - NIGHT

Kristen squeezes herself against the yellow rest room wall.

Trembling, she holds her twisted ankle and looks at her father 
in fear.

Jake takes off his torn coat and drapes it over his daughter's 
shoulders. She tries not to look at him.

          KRISTEN
     Don't hurt me.

          JAKE
     Come on, Kristen. Let's go home.

He helps her up.

                                   CUT TO:

EXT. O'FARRELL - NIGHT

Flashing red and yellow lights illuminate the chaos:

-- Curious mobs press against police lines.

-- Ambulance attendants lift Ratan's body onto a stretcher.

-- The two officers handcuff a bloodied and confused Tod.

-- Police officers interview Hope, Faith and other by- 
standers.

Mast walks over to Jake and Kristen. Niki watches from a 
distance.

          JAKE
     There's another one. Tod. In the 
     club.

Mast watches the ambulance attendants cover Ratan's body. 
Jake leads Kristen to a police car and places her in the 
rear seat.

Jake sees Niki in the crowd. She is watching Jake and Kristen. 
She knows she no longer has a place in his life.

He walks over to her.

          JAKE
     Niki, maybe I can... There's probably 
     some way to...

Niki does what Jake cannot: she breaks the connection.

          NIKI
          (ice cold)
     You got your daughter. I got my money. 
     So now fuck off.

Niki turns on her heel and walks into the neon darkness.

Jake walks back to Mast.

          JAKE
     Andy, can you do something for her? 
     Maybe money...

          MAST
     Go home, pilgrim. There's nothing 
     you can do. Forget this place. Start 
     over.

Jake walks back to where his daughter waits for him.

The MUSIC turns into an orchestrated version of "Precious 
Memories."

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

MONTAGE

As the MUSIC RISES we DISSOLVE BETWEEN:

-- Wes, Anne and Marsha welcome Kristen back in their home. 
Anne embraces her tearfully.

-- Jake, back at work, talks to Mary near the lathes.

-- Niki, wearing white vinyl boots and a blonde wig, walks 
the streets of Los Angeles.

-- Kristen lies sleeping peacefully in her bedroom.

-- Jake sleeps. Blue light falls across his face.

Slowly, burning through his face, the grainy black and white 
image of a girl wearing a black mask appears. A hand reaches 
down to pull off the mask.

Jake wakes suddenly from his dream, his screaming face double-
exposed with the terrified young girl's.

                                   FADE OUT:
                    THE END
