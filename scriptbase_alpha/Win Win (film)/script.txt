          EXT. WATCHUNG RESERVATION - DAWN.
                         
          It's a bitter cold January morning. The woods are quiet.
          Desolate. In the far off distance a man is jogging. He banks
          around the end of a small pond and runs right at us. This is
          MIKE FLAHERTY, FORTY-TWO. He is running hard. Or at least as
          hard as he can.
                         
          Suddenly TWO JOGGERS blow past him.
                         
                         
          INT. HOUSE, BEDROOM - SAME.
                         
          A HOME MADE STAIN GLASS ANGEL hangs on a window. It falls to
          the ground.
                         
          ABBY FLAHERTY, SIX-YEARS OLD, stirs and gets out of her bed
          out. She picks up the Bird and inspects it. It's broken.
                         
                          ABBY
           Shit.
                         
                         
          INT. HOUSE, BEDROOM - LATER.
                         
          JACKIE FLAHERTY, THIRTY-SEVEN is still sleeping. Abby walks
          into the room. Jackie opens her eyes.
                         
                          ABBY
                          (WHISPERS)
           Mommy, can we play croquet today?
                         
          Jackie lifts Abby onto the bed.
                         
                          ABBY (CONT'D)
           Where's Daddy?
                         
                          JACKIE
           He's running.
                         
                          ABBY
           From what?
                         
          Jackie smiles.
                         
                         
          INT. MIKE AND JACKIE'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - LATER.
                         
          STELLA, TWO YEARS OLD is standing up in her crib crying. Mike
          comes in and picks her up.
                         
                          MIKE
           OK. OK. Hi there.

          INT. MIKE AND JACKIE'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - LATER.
                         
          Jackie prepares some food. She knocks a glass over into the
          sink and it breaks.
                         
                          JACKIE
           Shit.
                         
          She looks over at Abby who is immersed in her coloring. Then
          she sets the food down in front of Stella who is sitting in a
          high chair. Mike enters wearing a suit and tie.
                         
                          JACKIE (CONT'D)
           How was the run?
                         
                         
                          MIKE JACKIE
          Good. It was good. Abby, finish your cereal.
                         
                          JACKIE (CONT'D)
                          (TO MIKE)
           I'm very impressed with you keeping
           it up.
                         
          Mike shrugs and takes a yogurt from the refrigerator.
                         
                          ABBY
           I don't like it.
                         
                          JACKIE
           You do too, so stop drawing and
           eat.
                         
                          MIKE ABBY
          What brand is this? Daddy, look. It's your team.
                         
                          JACKIE (CONT'D)
           They're all the same.
                         
          Mike looks at the drawing. It looks nothing like a team.
                         
                          MIKE
           That's my team? That's great,
           honey. Are they winning?
                         
                          ABBY
           Yeah.
                         
                          JACKIE
           Maybe you should show the team.

          Abby knocks over a glass of water. It spills onto the
          drawing.
                         
                          ABBY
           Shit.
                         
                          JACKIE
           Honey, you can't use that word.
           It's a bad word.
                         
          Off Mike's look.
                         
                          JACKIE (CONT'D)
           What? Don't look at me.
                         
                          MIKE
           Uh huh. Bye sweetie.
                         
          He kisses Abby.

           Can I have more juice?
                         
          Mike leaves. Jackie is not convinced.
                         
                          JACKIE

          Mike walks outside toward his car. He opens the car door.
                         
                          JACKIE
           Mike?
                         
          Mike turns. Jackie is standing at the door.
                         
                          JACKIE (CONT'D)

           No. I will today.
                         
                          JACKIE
           Please do. I don't want it coming
           down on the house.
                         
          Mike looks at a VERY DEAD TREE in the side yard.
                         
                          MIKE
           Yeah. You're right. I will.

           I love you too, sweetie. Bye.
                         
          Jackie shuts the door. Mike looks up at the tree.
                         
                          MIKE (CONT'D)

          Mike pays for his coffee and bagel and starts to leave. He
          nods to a group of FIVE OLD MEN who wave him over. He tries
          to keep moving but they continue to engage him. Finally he
          joins the table. The group shares a laugh.

          Mike's car pulls into a driveway of an OLD HOUSE that has
          been converted into TWO OFFICES.
                         
          A SIGN on the lawn reads: "MICHAEL S. FLAHERTY, COUNSELOR AT
          LAW" and "STEPHEN VIGMAN, CPA"
                         
                         
          EXT. MIKE'S OFFICE, PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS.
                         
          Mike parks his car as a WORKMAN walks up from the basement of
          the house and gets into his VAN and pulls away.
                         
          Mike gets out of his car and walks toward the back door
          carrying his briefcase. He stops at the basement steps.

          INT. MIKE'S OFFICE, BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS.
                         
          It's an old, musty basement filled with endless shelves of
          files.
                         
                          MIKE
           What's up, Vig?

           anything without her. It sucks.
                         
          STEPHEN VIGMAN, FIFTY, emerges carrying some files.
                         
                          MIKE
           Who was that guy?
                         
                          VIGMAN
           Oh, that sucks more. He's the
           plumber. I called him to look at
           that piece of crap of boiler.
                         
          Vigman points to an ANCIENT HOT WATER BOILER.

                          VIGMAN
           Well it is but he took one look at
           it and said we should replace it
           before it blows.
                         
                          MIKE

                          VIGMAN
           Six grand to replace everything.

           Tell me about it. I gotta be
           honest, Mike, it's not a good time
           for me. My business is off and my
           step son wants to get Lasik.
                         
                          MIKE
           Really? Isn't he too young?
                         
                          VIGMAN
           I don't really care at this point.
           If it makes him happy, he can have
           it. I get nothing from that kid.

           Well Leo, remember you got lost and
           the police had to help you a few
           times. That's why we brought Jolie
           into help you, right?

                          MIKE
           No, she can't. His guardian still
           has to make every single decision.

           That guy's starting another fund?

           Yeah. He's an animal. He prints
           money. Come on, let's finish
           strong.
                         
          Terry starts to run. Mike follows. After about thirty feet,
          Mike pulls up. He's breathing is labored.
                         
                          MIKE
           Hold up!

           Just...hold up.
                         
          Mike is really breathing hard now. He's making some funny
          noises.
                         
                          TERRY
           You alright?
                         
          Mike just holds up a hand. He can't really speak.

          wrong? Yeah. Fine. I just...
                         
          He drops to a knee. He's not alright.

           Holy fuck! Mike? Hang on pal.
                         
          Terry takes out his black berry but immediately fumbles it
          into the wet mud.

           That could be a heart attack, Mike.
           You should lie down.
                         
          Terry tries to help him but it's only seems to annoy Mike.

           to do that and I want to make sure
           that happens. If the State can do

                          MIKE
           Let me call you back.
                         
           TERRY (O.S.)
           Fine. But get rid of the convict,
           Mike!
                         
          Mike hangs up.
                         
                          SHELLY
           She's in a drug treatment program
           in Columbus. She has five weeks to
           go.

                          SHELLY
           They said she would call you.
                         
          Mike shakes his head. Nothing is easy here.

           are doing it right. You want to put
           your chest into his side.
                         
          Vig does it but he's a bit off.

          Vigman grabs Pill under the crotch, applies a stiff cross-
          face and then drives him hard to the mat. Another Wrestler,
          STEMLER chimes in. Stemler is wearing a STAR WARS t-shirt.

          He moves well. Fluidly. Carlos keeps trying to grab Kyle's
          ankle but Kyle easily defends against it. Mike checks his

          down to the mat.

          Kyle just looks at Mike, almost blank.
                         
                          KYLE
           I'm pretty good.

          Mike runs inside. It's a sparsely furnished bachelor pad with
          all the toys.
                         
           MIKE (O.S.)

           Yeah. Kyle Timmons. That's the kid?
                         
           MIKE (O.S.)
           Yeah. That's the kid!

          Terry is in the den at his computer, reading excitedly.
                         
                          TERRY
           Holy shit! He was thirty-five and
           one as a freshman!
                         
                          MIKE
           I know. He finished second at the
           states. In Ohio!
                         
          Mike walks into the kitchen and grabs a beer.
                         
                          TERRY
           This kid had seventeen pins. He's a
           killer.
                         
                          MIKE
           I know. It's nuts. And he quit
           after his freshman year.
                         
                          TERRY
           Why?
                         
                          MIKE
           I don't know. He doesn't talk much.
           He's kind of a weird kid. Why
           can't I have one kid like that on
           my team? Just one.

           What're you talking about? You do.
           You have him. You can take this kid
           to the states, Mike.
                         
                          MIKE
           He's not on the team, Ter. He's not
           even a student. He's been here for
           three days.
                         
                          TERRY
           So what? Enroll him!
                         
                          MIKE
           I'm not enrolling him. He's just
           here until we reach his mother and
           figure this out.
                         
                          TERRY
           So he's gotta do something, right?
           Let him wrestle. Look at this way,
           you're helping out the old man and
           this kid's a little bonus for doing
           the right thing.
                         
                          MIKE
           I'm not just helping out the old
           man, Ter. It's not like it's
           charity work. I'm getting paid for
           it.
                         
                          TERRY
           No. Shit, everyone gets paid, but
           think about it, Mike. What are the
           chances that this kid ends up on
           your door step and he can wrestle
           like that? It's a sign, pal.
                         
          This lands with Mike. Terry sits down at his computer.
                         
                          TERRY (CONT'D)
           Check this out. There's a video
           link of him wrestling in some
           tournament.
                         
          Terry presses play. It's grainy and amateur but good enough.
          Mike looks on.
                         
                          TERRY (CONT'D)
           Look at that kid.
                         
          Mike gets sucked in.

                          MIKE
           How the shoe's fit?
                         
                          KYLE
           Good.
                         
                          MIKE
           So let me ask you something, Kyle.
           You think you might want to wrestle
           in a match?
                         
                          KYLE
           OK.
                         
                          MIKE
           Great. We have a match on Saturday.
           What do you wrestle?
                         
                          KYLE
           One-nineteen.
                         
                          TERRY
           Excellent. Done.
                         
                          KYLE
           Is anyone there now?
                         
                          MIKE
           Yeah. Jimmy Reed. But I think he
           might be better off at 125.
                         
                          KYLE
           Don't you think we should wrestle
           off?
                         
           MIKE/TERRY/VIG
           Yeah.

          KYLE's tying his NEW WRESTLING SHOES. The rest of the team is
          sitting around the mat.
                         
                          VIGMAN
           Alright, let's go guys. Wrestle
           off.
                         
                          MIKE

           Yeah.
                         
                          TERRY
           I'll do it.
                         
          Terry grabs the watch from Mike.
                         
                          TERRY (CONT'D)
           You don't mind, do you?
                         
                          VIGMAN
           No. Go ahead.
                         
          Mike gives Terry a look. Vig minds. Kyle and JIMMY REED shake
          hands. And set themselves on their marks.
                         
                          VIGMAN (CONT'D)
           Ready? And...wrestle.
                         
          Vigman blows his whistle and the room erupts in cheering.
          Most of it for Jimmy Reed except for Stemler who is rooting
          for Kyle.
                         
          Jimmy and Kyle lock arms but Kyle pushes him away. Jimmy
          locks again but Kyle pushes him away again. Jimmy comes in
          hard this time and Kyle uses his momentum to quickly throw
          him to the ground.
                         
          Jimmy tries to scramble to his knees but Kyle is all over
          him. He quickly locks Jimmy in a cradle and rocks him onto
          his back. It looks easy. Vigman calls the pin. The room is
          quiet...except for Terry.
                         
                          TERRY
           Wow!
                         
          Mike shoots Terry a look. Kyle helps Jimmy off the mat.
                         
                          KYLE
           Good match.
                         
                          JIMMY
           Didn't feel good.
                         
          Vigman turns to Mike and Terry.
                         
                          VIGMAN
           I don't think we can teach him
           anything.

          Mike, Terry, Kyle, Jackie and the kids are eating pizza.
                         
                          TERRY
           I don't know why we didn't quit.
           Just the smell of that room brought
           back the memories. I hated it, it
           was like a form of self-abuse.
                         
                          KYLE
           Were you guys that bad?
                         
                          TERRY
           Mike was average. I sucked. Sorry
           Abby.
                         
                          ABBY

          Mike checks his watch.
                         
                          MIKE
           I gotta stop by the office and deal
           with the computer. Should I...?
                         
                          JACKIE
           No, I'll take him.
                         
                          TERRY
           We both should have quit. Then we
           could have joined the ski club and
           gotten busy with Allison Shepard on
           the overnights.

           Who was busy?
                         
                          JACKIE
           Your Uncle Terry is just silly.
                         
                          TERRY
           Sorry Abby. Getting busy is bad.
                         
          Kyle cracks up. Terry catches his eye.

          Terry is sitting in Mike's office. A bottle of scotch and two
          glasses on the desk.
                         
                          KYLE
           Hey, how do you think we'd do
           against Kyle? Now?
                         
           MIKE (O.S.)
           He'd kill us. Both of us. Together.
                         
                          TERRY
           Yeah, you're right. The kid has man
           strength, dude.
                         
          Mike emerges from under the desk.

           Yeah. You know. Not kid strength.
           Man strength.
                         
                          MIKE
           Yeah...I wouldn't say that around
           the locker room.
                         
                          TERRY

                          MIKE
           I don't have an IT guy. IT guys
           cost money.
                         
                          TERRY
           OK. I'm just gonna say what's on my
           mind. I want to be an assistant
           coach too.

           Especially compared to Vig.
                         
                          MIKE

                          TERRY
           Well first of all I'm fun. No
           denying that. And secondly, unlike
           Vig, I actually used to wrestle.
                         
                          MIKE
           Yeah, but Ter, you sucked.
                         
                          TERRY
           That doesn't matter, your team
           sucks. Plus I even look more like a
           coach then Vig.
                         
                          MIKE
           Yeah, that's not really value
           added.
                         
                          TERRY
           Look, Mike, I'm serious here. I
           need some distraction in my life
           right now. All I do is sit in my
           condo and think about Lori and that
           guy having sex in the jacuzzi I
           paid for. It's fucking unhealthy.
           I've been really kind of going
           crazy. Really.
                         
          Mike looks at his friend. He can tell he's serious.

          Jackie is hanging laundry. She hears a phone ringing from the
          laundry room. She peeks around the corner and sees that Kyle
          is not there. She crosses to his phone and picks it up. It
          reads "Mom". She answers it.
                         
                          JACKIE
           Hello? Hello, this Jackie Flaherty.
           Kyle is staying with us. Hello?
           (She closes the phone)
           I'm gonna kill that lady.
                         
          She sets the phone down and turns. Kyle is standing on the
          stairs. His hair is wet and he's carrying his towel.

                          KYLE
           You answered it?

           Yeah, well, I saw it was your Mom

                          JACKIE
           She didn't say anything. She hung
           up. Have you talked to her?

          Mike and Jackie are sleeping. A sound from downstairs. Then a
          door opens and shut. Mike sits up and listens.
                         
                          JACKIE

          The Pioneers are getting beat. Carlos is wrestling and
          putting up a good fight but time is running out and he's down
          by three points. He tries a desperate takedown but it
          backfires and the other wrestler picks up another two points.
          The buzzer sounds. Match over.
                         
          The team gets up to greet Carlos. Kyle strips off his sweats
          and buckles up his head gear. He walks up to Mike for a pep
          talk.
                         
                          MIKE

           know...be ready out there.
                         
          Terry gives Vigman a look. "Be ready?"

           Uh, OK.
                         
          Mike cuffs Kyle on the side of the head gear.

          Mike slaps him hard. And Kyle sprints to the mat and takes
          his stance.
                         
          The Ref blows the whistle and the wrestlers circle each
          other. The OTHER WRESTLER is clearly on the offensive.

           break.
                         
          The Other Wrestler is relentless. Kyle keeps trying to get up
          and the kid keeps breaking him down. Kyle stands up and Other
          Wrestler slams him to the mat. Kyle is getting beat up.
                         
          The two Wrestlers go out of bounds and the Ref stops the
          action. Kyle gets up and Mike checks in with him.

          The Ref blows the whistle and Kyle explodes to his feet,
          kicking a leg back between the Other Wrestler's legs. He

          Kyle shakes the other wrestler's hands and the Ref raises his
          hand in victory. Kyle crosses to the opposing coaches and
          shakes their hands. Then he runs to back to his bench. Mike

           So he's gonna be overconfident. You
           take advantage of that and when you
           get your shot, put him away.
                         
          Kyle nods and Mike slaps him across the face and Kyle sprints
          to his place on the mat and gets ready. Mike turns to the
          team.

          The Ref blows the whistle and the match starts. As Mike
          predicted KENNY RANDALL tries to end the match quickly with a
          throw but Kyle is too strong and too good. Kyle counters and
          throws Kenny to his back. Before anyone can blink, Kyle pins
          him. Mike, Terry, and Vigman explode off their chairs.
           MIKE (CONT'D) TERRY

          Kenny Randall looks shocked. He throws off his head gear and
          gets up. The MILBURN COACHES look equally shocked. The Ref
          raises Kyle's hands. Kyle runs over to shake the Milburn
          Coaches hand and then he runs back to his bench and is
          greeted by Mike.

           No. It's gonna be fine.

          The SCORE BOARD reads 33- 31. The 112 pound weight class is
          wrestling.
                         
                          MIKE
           Hook the arm! Carlos, hook the arm!
                         
          Carlos does and holds on for the win. The team cheers. Mike
          turns to Vigman and Terry.
                         
                          MIKE (CONT'D)
           How we doing?
                         
                          VIGMAN
           With that win, we're up by five. If
           Stemler doesn't get pinned, we win.

           I can hear you, Coach.
                         
          They all turn. Stemler is standing right there. He looks
          petrified.
                         
                          VIGMAN
           Good job, Ter.

           Sorry, Stemler. You're a champ.
                         
                          MIKE
           Come here, Stemler.
                         
          Mike takes Stemler by the shoulders.

           You've been practicing for a long
           time. You're ready for this. You
           hear me?
                         
          Stemler nods.
                         
                          MIKE (CONT'D)
           If you get in trouble out there,
           you just listen to me. I'm right
           here, OK?
                         
          Stemler nods again. Too scared to respond.
                         
                          MIKE (CONT'D)
           OK. You are not going to get
           pinned! You hear me! No way!
                         
                          STEMLER
                          (BARELY AUDIBLE)
           No way. No way.
                         
                          MIKE
           Good. Now I'm going to slap you.
           Ready?
                         
                          STEMLER
           Yeah but not so hard.
                         
          Mike gives him an odd half-slap and Stemler runs out to the
          mat and takes his place at the line. The team cheers.
                         
          But then the other WRESTLER runs out. He is wearing a BLACK
          PROTECTIVE FACE MASK. Stemler spins away from the line and
          looks pleading at Mike.
                         
                          STEMLER (CONT'D)
           Holy shit! It's Darth Vader! Are
           you kidding me? No way!
                         
          He does look like Darth Vader. But in a singlet.
                         
           MIKE/TERRY/VIGMAN
           Don't worry. It's just a mask. You
           are ready! Get on that line. Now!

           Secret Apprentice. You got this.
                         
          Stemler buys it.
                         
                          STEMLER
           Yeah. You're right.
                         
          Stemler returns to the line slightly more confident. The Ref
          blows the whistle and the match starts. Stemler is
          immediately taken down. Terry looks at his feet.

          It's late in third period. Stemler is losing 13-0. Stemler
          is flat on his belly and he's getting mauled. The Ref calls
          him for stalling. One point. 14-0. Thirty seconds to go.

                          VIGMAN
           He's one point away from a tech
           fall and we'd lose on criteria.
                         
                          MIKE
           Shit. Really?

                          VIGMAN
           If he falls behind by fifteen
           points it's a technical fall. They
           get five team points. If that
           happens the score would be tied but
           we'd lose the match on criteria.

          Stemler almost manages a smile and then he hits "the move".
          It's not pretty but somehow he manages to get up and out. The
          team goes nuts. One point for Stemler. 15-1.
                         
          The Other kid frantically tries to take him down but Stemler
          holds him off dancing wildly around the mat. The buzzer
          sounds. The team goes nuts.
                         
          The Ref raises the other wrestler's hand in victory but it's
          Stemler who celebrates as if he just won the states. He runs
          off the mat and into the arms of his teammates.

           Right. OK. So I'll go get Kyle.
                         
          Mike starts to go but Cindy doesn't quite seem ready.

           Oh, he's doing really well. He's
           going to the high school here and
           he's wrestling on the team
           actually.
                         
                          CINDY
           Really? That's good. He loves
           wrestling so much.
                         
                          JACKIE
           He's a really sweet kid. Our girls
           love him.

          Jackie and Mike share a look. Then Jackie caves and slides
          over next to her.

           You know Kyle's doing really well
           with wrestling here, Cindy. The
           regions are this weekend and if he
           wins there then he goes to the
           states.
                         
                          CINDY
           That's great.
                         
                          MIKE
           Yeah. It is and it could be really
           good for him. It might even mean a
           scholarship. Anyway, I was
           wondering if you could stay here
           for another three weeks until
           that's all over.

           Cindy has decided that she wants a

           What kind of a role is that?
                         
                          CINDY
           I want to take care of him.

           Really? So you want to move here?
                         
                          ELEANOR
           No. Cindy would like to bring her
           father back to Columbus.

           Well I'm not sure that's what Leo
           wants.
                         
                          CINDY
           I already talked to him about it.
           He seem to like the idea.
                         
                          MIKE
           I understand that, Cindy. But you
           haven't seen Leo in a long time and
           he's battling dementia now so it
           puts me in a tough position here.

           So do I and I'm sure we can. Now,
           I'm sorry, but I actually have to
           go see a client so we'll have to
           set up another time to discuss

           I just can't go back in front of

           So maybe you'll get a different

                          MIKE
           She's the only Judge who handles
           these cases and if I look bad in
           front of her right now, I'm
           screwed. I'll have to close my
           fricking doors.
                         
                          TERRY
           Then dump it. Give her Poplar. It
           sucks but you've got your practice

           hate each other. You can't let her

          The four men walk into the huge gym. It's packed. Kyle is
          completely focused.
                         
                          VIGMAN
           Wow. This is big time. I bet there

          Mike smiles but then his smile fades. Cindy Timmons is
          standing against the wall. She steps forward and Kyle sees
                         HER

           Listen to me. One more win and we

           what counts. That's all that
           matters. You hear me?
                         
          Kyle nods. Mike can tell that he's half listening.
                         
                          MIKE (CONT'D)
           Hey! Kyle. Stay in this, OK. This
           is your place. You are in control,
           remember! You control it. Now go
           get him. Finish this!
                         
          Mike slaps him. And Kyle races to the mat.
                         
          The wrestlers slap hands and THE REF blows the whistle. Kyle
          immediately shoots in for a double leg. The Other Wrestler
          tries to sprawl but Kyle is in too deep. Kyle lifts him high
          and dumps him hard to the mat. The audience reacts and the
          Ref stops the action. The other wrestler bravely pops up but
          he is obviously stung.

          Kyle looks at Mike and nods but his eyes are wild. The Ref
          blows the whistle and Kyle and the Other Wrestler lock up.
          They dance a bit and finally the Other Wrestler tries to wrap
          Kyle up. Kyle back pedals and then literally throws the Other
          Wrestler off the mat. The Ref has seen enough. He quickly
          issues Kyle his second warning and disqualifies him from the
          match. It's over.
                         
          The Other Wrestler pops up and runs at Kyle. Kyle responds.
          The Coaches all intervene. It's a melee.

          Mike squeezes him.

          takes his hand. They all get into their car. Mike is just
          about to get in but then he sees Cindy standing by her car

          He sits on one bed.

           No. What do you want?

           I just wanted to say how sorry I
           was about the match and if I did
           anything to cause it then I will
           never forgive myself. I know how
           much wrestling means to you, baby.

                          CINDY
           No. I also wanted to say that I'll
           do whatever you think is best for
           Leo. I promise.

           OK. I will. If that's what you
           want. But I have to be honest, I'm
           not sure that's what Leo wants.

           It's the court transcript from when
           Leo was in court. My lawyer got it.

          Finally, he wraps his arms around Kyle and pulls him off.
          Kyle spins free and fronts Terry. Terry immediately puts up

           mind. No one can question that.
                         
                          MIKE
           I can't, Jack.
                         
                          JACKIE
           Why not?
                         
                          MIKE
           Because it's not true.
                         
                          JACKIE
           Well I'm glad your done lying now,
           just in time to lose your practice.
           That's how we survive, Mike. Your
           family. You ever think of that?
                         
                          MIKE
           Yeah. All the time.
                         
          Jackie quickly crosses to the sink. She starts to clean. She
          breaks something.

          Jackie and Mike walk downstairs. Kyle is angrily gathering
          his stuff and putting it in his back pack.

           Are you hungry? I was gonna make
           some pancakes.
                         
                          KYLE
           No. I'm leaving. I just came to get
           my shit.
                         
          They share a look and walk over to Kyle.
                         
                          MIKE

           I moved Leo back home, Kyle. And

           So what?! You want me to forgive

           No. I just want you to give me
           another chance. That's all I'm
           asking.
                         
          Mike's sincerity is undeniable. Kyle looks to Jackie. They
          connect. Kyle shakes his head, turns around, and then throws
          his bag.
                         
                          KYLE

          Mike looks at Jackie.
                         
                          MIKE
           Hey, Kyle, listen -

           OK. All right. Yeah.
                         
          Jackie and Mike turn and start to walk upstairs but Jackie
          stops.
                         
                          JACKIE
           Kyle, I just wanna say - we love
           you.
                         
          Kyle keeps his back turned to them as they continue up the
          stairs.

          Mike is sitting alone at the kitchen table drinking a cup of
          coffee. The remnants of a pancake breakfast are on the table.
          There is one clean plate where Kyle usually sits.
                         
          After a moment, Kyle comes up from the basement and sits down
          at the table without saying anything.
                         
          He just looks at Mike. Then he serves himself a few pancakes.
          Mike passes him the bottle of syrup. He takes it and puts
          some on his pancakes.
                         
          He eats. Mike watches.

                          JACKIE
           Do you have time to eat.
                         
                          MIKE
           I'll eat there.
                         
                          JACKIE
           Make sure you do.

          INT. MIKE AND JACKIE'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - LATER.
                         
          Mike takes off his suit and throws it on the bed. He puts on
          a casual button down blue shirt.
                         
          He takes a hard look himself in the mirror, almost as if he's
          steeling himself for something.
                         
          Mike smiles.
                         
                         
          INT. BAR - NIGHT.
                         
          Terry walks in and crosses to the bar. He sits down.
                         
                          TERRY
           Can I get a banana daiquiri,
           please?
                         
          The Bartender turns. It's Mike.
                         
                          MIKE
           Sure.
                         
          Mike opens a beer and sets it down in front of Terry.
                         
                          MIKE (CONT'D)
           You want an umbrella with that?
                         
                          TERRY
           Nah. I'm good. But keep these
           coming.
                         
          Mike checks a ticket and prepares two drinks.
                         
                          TERRY (CONT'D)
           So how you doing, pal?
                         
                          MIKE
           Me? I'm pretty good.
                         
          We hold on Mike as he continues to work.
                         
           BLACK OUT.
