"Lord of Illusions" -- by Clive Barker


     TITLE SEQUENCE


     As the credits run, we INTERCUT the following two sequences:


     EXT. NEVADA DESERT - IDOLS - DAY


     A SLOW DRIFT through a collection of crudely constructed,
     surreal, six-foot tall "IDOLS."  Like modern demons. 
     Grotesque.  Disturbing. WE LAP DISSOLVE between details of
     their twisted anatomies:  headlamp eyes, bright metal claws,
     broken glass teeth.

     EXT. NEVADA ROADS - DESERT - DAY

     Two vehicles, one a Volkswagen "bus" decorated with stylized
     flames, the other a '66 Thunderbird, speeding along a series
     of eerily empty desert roads, somewhere in a wilderness of
     sand and heat.

     END CREDITS.

                    CUT WIDE TO;

     EXT. NEVADA DESERT - DAY

     A violent WIND HOWLS around, but through the sand we-can just
     make out a large, ominous building:  the HOUSE of William
     Nix.  Its walls are white-washed and scrawled with GRAFFITI. 
     The "family" of IDOLS surrounds the doorway, guarding it. ON
     SCREEN, the words:  '"Nevada - Thirteen Years Ago"

     EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - DAY

     We're at the front door now, which stands open.  Leaning
     against the door-frame is a scrawny, wild-eyed YOUTH, about
     sixteen.  His name is BUTTERFIELD.  He's got a brooding,
     almost sultry look on his face.  One of his eyes is black,
     the other milky blue.  He's whittling something with a
     scalpel. Distantly, the sound of CAR ENGINES.  Butterfield
     narrows his eyes.

     BUTTERFIELD'S P.O.V.

     The Volkswagen "bus" and Thunderbird are approaching the
     house.

                    BUTTERFIELD
               (softly)
          Swann...?

     He turns from the door.  In his haste he drops the WOOD he's
     whittling.  He's been carving a DEATH'S HEAD.

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - ROOMS AND CORRIDORS - DAY

     The house no longer serves any domestic function.  It has
     become the temple and dormitory of Nix's small apocalyptic
     cult.  As we go through the house with Butterfield we glimpse
     a little of what life here is like. 

     The rooms are murky, and chaotic.  The walls, PAINTED with
     scenes of cities and landscapes BURNING, and creatures from
     some unspeakable nightmare ATTACKING, RAPING, and DEVOURING
     helpless humanity.  The atmosphere is joyless, and
     oppressive. 

     The passages become progressively darker as the boy makes his
     way to the heart of the house.  Only OIL LAMPS, set on the
     floor, light these claustrophobic corridors.

                    BUTTERFIELD
          Master?

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - DAY

     A dozen CULTISTS sit cross-legged on the floor in front of
     their leader, WILLIAM NIX.  His black hair grows to his
     shoulders.  His eyes are deep and glittering, his voice
     seductive.  A terrifying yet charismatic presence. 

     All the Cultists - who are a cross-section of obsessives -
     wear the same simple T-shirts, painted with the cult's SIGIL. 
     They watch Nix in adoration. 

     As Nix speaks, he juggles a FLAME, passing it from hand to
     hand with casual ease...

                    NIX
          And the fire said to me:  Nix, Nix,
          you're my instrument. From now on,
          you'll be called the Puritan...

                    CULTISTS
               (murmuring)
          Puritan...

     NIX You will find a few good men and women, and together,
     together you will cleanse the world.

                    CULTISTS
          Yes...

     Butterfield enters. 

                    BUTTERFIELD
          Master?

     Nix looks up.

                    BUTTERFIELD
          Swann's here. 

     Nix rises, smiling.

                    NIX
               (to Cultists)
          We'll come back to this. Get about
          your business. 

     As the Cultists disperse, Nix and Butterfield exit into

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

     A place of nightmares. Hanging from the middle of the ceiling
     is another grotesque SCULPTURE, three times the bulk of a
     large man, and made of metal, fly-blown animal parts and
     knotted rope.  It is vaguely cruciform, but its swaying,
     creaking bulk is not even faintly Christian.  It is a
     perverse, sickening image, evoking insanity and agony.

     From the shadows in the corner, we hear a young girl's soft
     SOBBING.

                    NIX
          Hush...

     Nix goes to the GIRL.  She is twelve; beautiful, blonde, and
     presently in a state of mortal fear.  She sits, bound, in a
     fetal position, her face soaked with SWEAT and TEARS, her
     mouth BLOODIED, her cheek BRUISED.

                    NIX
          I said hush.

                    GIRL
          Please.  Let me go.

     From the opposite corner the SCREECH of Nix's pet BABOON. 
     Nix goes to it.  The animal is large and lethal.

                    NIX
               (to Baboon)
          What is it?

     The Baboon pulls on its chain, staring at the Girl and baring
     its teeth as it screeches.

                    NIX
               (to Girl)
          I think he's in love.

     He unshackles the Baboon.  The animal pads toward the Girl,
     trailing its chain.

                    GIRL
          Keep it away from me.

     Nix catches hold of its chain.  Holds it back.  The Baboon
     starts screeching again, scrabbling at the Girl, its NAILS
     catching her arms and legs, drawing BLOOD.

                    GIRL
          Please... please...

     Nix watches her terror dispassionately.

                    BUTTERFIELD
               (also watching, wide-
          eyed)
          Want me to shoot Swann?

                    NIX
          You don't like him, do you?

                    BUTTERFIELD
          He wants your magic.

                    NIX
          Maybe.  Go fetch him.

     Butterfield exits.  Nix advances on the Girl.

                    GIRL
          What are you going to do?

                    CUT TO:

     EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - DESERT - DAY

     The two vehicles come to a halt outside Nix's house.

     From the Thunderbird steps PHILIP SWANN, a nineteen- year-old
     with shoulder-length hair and brilliant blue eyes.  He's not
     conventionally handsome, but he's certainly striking. 

     From the passenger seat steps CASPAR QUAID, a black man,
     studious and intense.  From the bus emerges MURRAY PIMM,
     skinny and jittery, and JENNIFER DESIDERIO, a woman with a
     steely gaze.

                    SWANN
               (to all three)
          Are we ready?

                    JENNIFER
               (cool)
          Say the word.

                    PIMM
               (very nervous)
          Look, maybe we should think this over.

     On Swann, as he brings from his car three very bizarre pieces
     of METALWORK.  We get only a tantalizing glimpse of them, as
     he slips them into his pocket.

                    SWANN
          No.  He's gone too far.

                    PIMM
          So he took a child.

                    JENNIFER
          He'll kill her.

                    PIMM
          No he won't.

                    SWANN
               (determined)
          He's not going to get the chance.

     Quaid checks a gun, then slips it into his belt.

                    QUAID
          If he gets in our fucking heads he'll drive us crazy.

                    SWANN
          So stay out here.

     Swann starts towards the House.  Jennifer is the first to
     follow, with the other two on her heels.

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

     Butterfield comes to the door, as Swann steps inside.

                    BUTTERFIELD
          He's expecting you.

     Behind Swann, Quaid and Pimm exchange nervous looks.

                    SWANN
               (to others)
          Look around.  If you find 'the
          child, yell.  She's got blonde
          hair, that's all I know.

     Butterfield turns away, smiling to himself.  Swann follows
     him.

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - "MEDITATION" ROOM - DAY

     Quaid looks into a large circular room where FIVE CULTISTS
     (three men and two women) still sit.  One of the women is
     breast-feeding a baby.

                    1ST MAN
          Hey, Quaid.  I thought you said you
          weren't coming back.

                    QUAID
          I changed my mind.

                    1ST WOMAN
          Come and join us.

     She smiles a crazy smile.  Reaches out for Quaid.  A SNAKE
     appears from around the back of her neck.  Quaid recoils. 

     And now we see that there are snakes everywhere.  In the
     Cultists' clothes and hair.  Even on the baby.  Quaid turns
     away.  And - shock! - there's a SNAKE on the door frame,
     winding around his hand.  He strikes it to the ground, and
     drives his heel down on its head.

                    SNAKE-HANDLER CULTIST
               (angry)
          Don't do that!

     The Snake-Handler gets up.  Quaid retreats from the door. 
     Snake-Handler picks up the dead snake and, lifting it above
     his head, dribbles its BLOOD onto his face.

     INT.   NIX'S  HOUSE  -   "BEDROOM"   -  DAY

     Jennifer enters a gloomy room.  She goes to a mattress where
     a BLONDE GIRL lies with her bare back to us.

                    JENNIFER
          Don't be afraid.

     The Blonde Girl, BARBARA, turns over.  She has a dirty cloth
     pressed to a wound between her breasts.  It is not the Girl,
     of course.  She stares up at Jennifer, clearly drugged.

                    BARBARA
          I'm not... want to see?

     She pulls the cloth away.  She has carved the cult SIGIL into
     her FLESH.  The BLOODY KNIFE lies beside her. Jennifer
     retreats to the door, and exits back out into --

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

     Pimm is standing against the wall, clutching a CRUCIFIX. He
     is ashen with terror.  Jennifer snatches the crucifix from
     his white-knuckled fingers.

                    PIMM
          He's going to kill us all...

                    JENNIFER
          Where did Swann go?

     Pimm points down the passageway towards Nix's room.

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY OUTSIDE NIX'S SANCTUM - DAY

     Swann wipes sweat from his upper lip, then reaches down to
     his belt, to check the GUN tucked out of sight at his side. 
     He turns the door handle.

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

     Swann steps inside.  Nix's chair has its back to him. The
     folds of Nix's robe are visible, however.  Swann hears a
     muffled SOBBING from the far side of the room. 

     On the Girl, now gagged and lying amongst bones and filth.

     Swann starts towards her, his footsteps barely audible.  As
     he approaches the chair - the Baboon leaps at him screeching!

     He reaches for his gun.  The chair topples.  The Baboon, half
     dressed in Nix's robes, bounds towards Swann. 

     Swann FIRES at it.  The bullet blasts off half its head.

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

     On Quaid, who draws his GUN as three CULTISTS appear in the
     passageway that leads to Nix's Sanctum.

                    QUAID
          Stay the fuck away!
               (yells)
          Pimm!  Get over here!

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

     PAN UP from the twitching Baboon corpse to Swann as he
     struggles with the Girl's gag.  He has laid his gun on the
     ground beside her.

                    SWANN
          You're going to be okay.

     Out of focus, behind him, the cruciform sculpture swings
     round.  Nix is hanging on it, like an idol on a grotesque
     altarpiece. 

     The Girl sees Nix over Swann's shoulder.  Terror crosses her
     face.  Swann turns.

                    NIX
          I knew you'd come. 

     He reaches down to Swann.

                    NIX
          I've got so much power to give
          you, Swann.  All you have to do
          is...beg.

                    SWANN
          Fuck you.

                    NIX
          You don't think I've got it to
          give?

                    SWANN
          No!

     Suddenly. Nix swoops down on Swann. apparently defying
     gravity.

                    NIX
          You're wrong.

     He catches hold of Swann with one hand and drives him back
     against the wall.

                    NIX
          I could eat your fucking soul,
          Swann.

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

     Jennifer, reaches the door of the Sanctum.  Butterfield steps
     from the shadows.  His KNIFE flashes as it strikes Jennifer's
     hand.  BLOOD SPURTS.

                    JENNIFER
          Fuck!

     She retreats, staunching her bleeding hand.

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

     Nix has Swann trapped against the wall and is working his
     fingers against Swann's temples.  Working, working, like a
     psychic surgeon plying against the belly of a patient.

                    NIX
          You want to know what the world
          really looks like?

     Swann struggles, but he can't get free of Nix's hold. 

     And now -- horribly -- Nix's fingers slide beneath the skin
     of Swann's temples, without a drop of blood being spilt.

                    NIX
          Want to see flesh with a god's
          eyes?

     Swann SCREAMS as Nix's mind-hold seizes him.

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

     Quaid levels his gun at Butterfield, who is guarding the
     Sanctum door.  Jennifer is at Quaid's side.

                    SWANN (V.O.)
          Aah!

                    QUAID
          Get away from the door!

     Butterfield shakes his head.  Quaid FIRES.  The bullet.
     strikes the wall beside Butterfield's head.  He retreats,
     growling like a rabid animal.  Quaid kicks the Sanctum door
     open, and enters.

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

                    QUAID
          Swann?

                    NIX
               (to Quaid)
          Here he is.

     Swann stumbles into the middle of the room, the whites of his
     eyes blood-red.

                    NIX
          Take a look, Swann!  These are your
          friends.

     On Swann, reeling like a drunkard as he looks up at Quaid and
     Jennifer.

                    JENNIFER (V.O.)
          What have you done to him? 

SWANN'S P.O.V.

     of Quaid and Jennifer.  To Swann's eyes, their faces seem to
     be MORPHING.  Their humanity is MELTING AWAY. What's left is
     like a jellyfish with black, soulless eyes:  PRIMEVAL MUCK.

                    QUAID (V.O.)
          Swann.  It's okay.

     Quaid reaches for Swann, who retreats in horror, shaking his
     head violently.

                    SWANN
          Don't touch me.  He's got... got
          into my head.

                    NIX
          You want to be like that, Swann? 
          Mud and shit?

     Swann turns away from Quaid and Jennifer in disgust.

     SWANN'S P.O.V. 

     of Nix, his arms outstretched in welcome.  His face has an
     aura of pulsing light.

                    NIX
          Come here.  Share the power.

     ON a GUN, leveled. .We don't see by whom.  The trigger is
     pulled. 

     The bullet strikes Nix's back and explodes out of his chest.

     ON SWANN, staring at Nix. 

     SWANN'S P.O.V. of Nix, as the aura of light dies. 

     Just for a moment - a terrible moment - Swann glimpses
     something else. MORPHING out of Nix's features.  A NIGHTMARE
     FACE with waves of DARKNESS emanating from the middle of its
     forehead. 

     Swann covers his eyes.

                    NIX
               (raging, terrifying)
          Swann!  Swann!

     Nix staggers, letting out an ungodly HOWL, and drops to his
     knees, clutching the WOUND.  As he falls, he reveals the
     ashen Girl, who is still holding Swann's smoking GUN.

                    NIX
               (a roar)
          Help me!

     Swann shakes his head, ridding himself of Nix's mind-
     control.

                    SWANN
          Jesus-

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY OUTSIDE SANCTUM - DAY

     Pinon stands guard, his gun pointed on several cultists.

                    1ST CULTIST
               (with distressing
          confidence)
          You can't kill him.

                    2ND CULTIST
          He'll just rise up again!

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

     On Nix, doing just that:  rising up.  Right hand clamped to
     his bloody chest, left hand reaching for Swann.

                    NIX
          Help me!

     Quaid FIRES at him again. Strikes his shoulder.  And again. 
     Strikes his leg.  Nix collapses to the ground,

                    JENNIFER
          Quickly!

     They have come prepared for this.  Swann now takes from his
     jacket the three strange pieces of METALWORK.  There are
     SCREWS in then all.

                    NIX
               (seeing)
          Swann?  What are you doing?

                    SWANN
          Binding you.

     He clamps one of the pieces over Nix's EYES.  It fits like an
     eyeless mask.  Nix thrashes and SCREAMS.  Swann lays his
     hands on the side of the mask, and — LIKE MAGIC -- his touch
     makes the screws tighten of their own accord, grinding into
     Nix's flesh and bone with a gut- wrenching SOUND.  BLOOD runs
     from the screw-holes.

                    NIX
          Fuck you, Swann!  Fuck you!

     Now the second piece, over his MOUTH.

                    NIX
          Sw—

     He's silenced.  The piece screws itself into-his head, like
     the first.  And now comes the third and final piece:  over
     the nose and into the ears.  Again, it screws itself into
     place. 

     Swann has done all he can.  He retreats from Nix's body, as
     it continues to convulse.  We go from face to ashen face, as
     each man and woman watches and waits.  Why won't he die? 

     And now, at last  the violence of Nix's death-throes
     diminishes.  Nix's body bends like a bow, arching off the
     ground, and with one last, terrible spasm, he dies.

                    GIRL
               (quietly)
          Is it finished?

                    SWANN
          It's finished.

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

     The Cultists' faces slacken, as though some mental hold Nix
     had upon them has disappeared.  Then they start to retreat,
     their confidence and courage gone. 

     Pimm steps into the Sanctum.

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

     The five assassins, including the Girl, stand around Nix's
     body.  Swann has his arm around the Girl.

                    PIMM
          Dead?

                    QUAID
          Dead.

                    PIMM
          What now?

                    SWANN
          We bury him so deep no one will
          ever find him.

                    CUT TO:

     EXT. NIX'S .HOUSE - WIDE SHOT - DUSK

     The wind has died away.  It's eerily calm.  Butterfield
     dashes towards camera, then halts. 

     HE LOOKS BACK, as Nix's killers load his huge, limp CORPSE
     into the back of Murray Pimm's bus. 

     ON Butterfield.  He watches, with a feral look on his face.

                    FADE OUT

                    FADE IN

     EXT. LOS ANGELES - MONTAGE - DAY

     The city looks magical in the spring light, its palms and
     gleaming towers, its rivers of sun-baked traffic, evoking
     some fantastical metropolis.  This, for all its smog and
     congestion, is a city of exoticism and enchantments.

     ON SCREEN, the words:  "LOS ANGELES - THIRTEEN YEARS LATER"

     EXT. STARDUST HOTEL - DAY

     The facade of this small HOTEL off Hollywood Boulevard needs
     a lick of paint, and the neon sign is blinking fitfully, but
     it has a certain charm.

     INT. STARDUST HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY

     A large deteriorating mural of Hollywoodland, depicting a
     host of 50's movie stars, dominates the lobby. 
     At the front desk - with his back to us at present - stands
     HARRY D'AMOUR.  He is having difficulty getting the pretty
     but vacant BLONDE at the reception desk to comprehend his
     name.

                    BLONDE GIRL
          How'd you spell that again?

                    HARRY
          D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry
          D'Amour.

                    BLONDE GIRL
          D'Amour.

                    HARRY
          Right.

                    BLONDE GIRL
          Isn't that French for something?

     ON THE BELLBOY, approaching Harry from the front door.

                    BELLBOY
          Mister D'Amour?

                    HARRY
               (to Blonde)
          Yeah.  It's French.

                    BLONDE GIRL
          For love, right?

                    BELLBOY
          Mister D'Amour?

                    HARRY
               (to Blonde)
          Right.

                    BLONDE GIRL
               (grinning)
          That's so cool.

                    BELLBOY
          Mister D'Amour?

     Harry turns.  He's wearing a washed-out Grateful Dead t-
     shirt, an Italian cut linen suit, and glasses.  He's
     handsome, unshaven, 35-ish, with an open easy smile.

                    HARRY
          Yeah?

                    BELLBOY
          You haven't paid the cab.  He won't
          give us your bags 'til you pay him.

                    HARRY
          How much?

                    BELLBOY
          Thirty-five bucks.

                    HARRY
          Tell him he can keep them. The
          Bellboy looks puzzled.

                    HARRY
          Just kidding.

     Harry gets out his wallet and hands over four ten-dollar
     bills.

                    HARRY
          I've got my life in there.

     INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

     On the suit-case, which is now on the bed.  Harry flings it
     open.  Inside, mingled with the clothes, a bizarre collection
     of items, which he tosses out onto the coverlet.  A GUN.  A
     CRUCIFIX.  A STATUE of Shiva, the Hindu Lord of creation and
     destruction. 

     ON HARRY, as he heads into the bathroom.  Turns on the
     shower.  Starts to undress.

     EXT. STARDUST HOTEL - DUSK

     Harry, his hair still wet from his shower, steps out into the
     sun.  Squints.  Puts on sunglasses.

                    HARRY
          Hello, L.A.

                    BELLBOY
          Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.

                    HARRY
          You bet.

     EXT. MELROSE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

     Harry stands, in a shabby doorway across the street from a
     classy restaurant.  It's RAINING.
     ON TAPERT, a middle-aged, balding man with a very pretty
     WOMAN opposite him, sitting at a table close to the window. 
     Tapert makes a joke (unheard).  The woman laughs. 

     ON HARRY, chewing on a hamburger, as he speaks into his tape
     recorder.

                    HARRY
          Nine-eighteen p.m.  Tapert's either
          got a great sense of humour or he's
          paying her to laugh.
               (looks at hamburger in
          disgust)
          Jesus.

     On Tapert, as he rises from the table.

                    HARRY
               (into tape recorder)
          He's finished.

     Tapert exits the restaurant, and crosses the street. Harry
     tosses his half-eaten hamburger away, and goes to his car.

     EXT. HARRY'S CAR - MELROSE - NIGHT

     Harry pulls the parking ticket off the windshield, screws it
     up and gets in.

     INT. HARRY'S CAR - MELROSE - NIGHT

                    HARRY
               (into tape)
          Nine twenty-six p.m.  He's off
          again.

     He turns the key in the ignition.

                    CUT  TO:

     EXT. QUAID'S OFFICES - SILVERLAKE - NIGHT

     In neon blue and purple, a sign blazes in a store window.  It
     reads:  TAROT CARD AND CRYSTAL READINGS - $15 SPECIAL

     ON TAPERT, as he hurries across the street, and through the
     door beside the store window. 

     WE PAN OFF the door as Harry's car comes to a halt on the far
     side of the street. 

     Harry gets out of the car.  Stares at the sign in the window,
     puzzled.

                    HARRY
          Superstitious?

     He starts across the street.  Suddenly:

                    TAPERT (V.O.)
          Oh my God!

     Tapert emerges, his face white with terror.  He stumbles to
     his car, and he's away.  Harry freezes, caught between the
     need to follow Tapert and sheer curiosity. He gives in to the
     latter, and steps inside.

     INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - STAIRWELL - NIGHT

     An illuminated ARROW points up the stairs.  Harry ascends,
     past faded PHOTOGRAPHS of Caspar Quaid with famous faces.

     At the landing, the passageway turns ninety degrees. Harry
     halts, and takes out his GUN. 

     There's a strange RUMBLING SOUND approaching from round the
     corner.  Harry chances a look.  There's a short length of
     passageway, leading to an open door.  From the threshold a
     CRYSTAL BALL rolls towards Harry, BLOOD- SMEARED.  This is
     the source of the rumbling.  Harry stops the ball before it
     falls down the stairs. 

     Dead silence.  After a beat, Harry creeps towards the open
     door.  He pushes it open.  Inside, chaos.  The fake antique
     FURNITURE is splintered, the ASTRAL CHARTS slashed.

     INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

     There are two offices.  In the front, a Waiting Room, into
     which Harry now steps.  Beyond it, through a door that stands
     narrowly ajar, the Fortune Telling Room. 

     From out of the Fortune Telling Room, a MOAN.

                    QUAID (V.O.)
          Ahh. . .

     Harry crosses the Waiting Room, reaching into his jacket for
     his gun.  Suddenly, a nightmarish FIGURE leaps from the
     shadows. 

     His name is RAY MILLER.  He's as crazy as a rabid dog, teeth
     sharpened, eyes wild.  Nix's SIGIL is tattooed on the middle
     of his forehead.  He STRIKES the GUN from Harry's hand and
     goes for his throat. 

     Harry reaches out behind him, picks up a phrenologist's BUST
     and SMASHES it on Miller's skull. 

     Miller reels back.  Harry makes a dash for the door to the
     Fortune Telling Room.

                    MILLER
          Fuckhead.

     INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - FORTUNE-TELLING ROOM - NIGHT

     A mysterious, candle-lit space.  In the middle of the room, a
     table.  At it sits Quaid. thirteen years older. He has been
     tortured close to death.  Several small SCALPELS protrude
     from his chest and neck.  His life is ebbing away.  On the
     table in front of him, a fan of TAROT CARDS, BLOOD-SPATTERED.

     Harry races in through the open door from the Waiting Room.

                    HARRY
          What the fuck!?

     Harry picks up the PHONE.  It's dead.  Miller charges at the
     door.

                    HARRY
          Shit!

     Harry SLAMS the door in Miller's face, and locks it. 

     As he does so, the candles FLICKER.  Harry looks up.  A
     FIGURE looms from the darkness behind Quaid.  He's in his
     late twenties:  an androgynous, disturbing sight. His long
     hair is drawn back into a pony-tail.  His mismatched eyes -
     one black, one milky blue, tell us that he is Butterfield. 
     His hands are BLOODY, and he carries one last SCALPEL.

                    HARRY
               (to Butterfield)
          Don't touch him."

     Butterfield strokes the wounds on Quaid's cheek.  Quaid sobs
     in pain. 

                    BUTTERFIELD
          What are you going to do about it? 

     Miller's hand tears at the wood around the lock from the
     other side.  His fingers appear, scrabbling to tear the lock
     out.  Harry doesn't move, or Miller will be through.

                    BUTTERFIELD
               (to Harry)
          Ever watched a man die?  If you
          watch very closely, you can
          sometimes see the soul escaping. 
          And if you're very quick, you can
          catch it.

                    QUAID
          Please... Butterfield... I wasn't
          there.  Ask Pimm.

                    BUTTERFIELD
          Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's
          disappeared.  They knew the Puritan
          was coming home. 

     As this exchange goes on, Miller pulls the lock out of the
     door and starts to THROW HIMSELF against it from the other
     side.  It's all Harry can do to keep himself from being
     pitched across the room.  He looks around for some means of
     defense.  There's a crack in the drapes to the left of the
     table.  Behind it a WINDOW.

                    BUTTERFIELD
          So do you.  You've seen the future. 
          Haven't you?

                    QUAID
          Yes.

                    BUTTERFIELD
          And are you afraid?

                    QUAID
          Yes.

     Suddenly, Harry steps aside.  The door's flung open. Miller
     CHARGES in.  Harry catches hold of his arm, and THROWS him
     against the drape.  The window CRACKS; the drape comes down
     around Miller.  Amber STREETLIGHT floods in. 

     Butterfield is momentarily distracted.  Harry STRIKES the
     scalpel from his hands. 

     Miller, meanwhile, is struggling to free himself from the
     folds of the drapes.  Harry lands a solid KICK to the man's
     belly.  Miller is THROWN back against the cracked window,
     which SHATTERS.  Still wrapped in the drape, he FALLS OUT. 

     Harry turns back to arrest Butterfield, but he's already
     making his escape.  Harry starts after him.

                    QUAID
               (to Harry)
          Don't leave me.

     He turns back.  TEARS are pouring down the man's face. Harry
     goes back to comfort Quaid, as Butterfield escapes down the
     stairs.


                    HARRY
          You need an ambulance.

                    QUAID
               (in pain)
          Too late.  Why are you here? Did
          you cone... up here for a reading? 

     Quaid takes hold of Harry's hand.

                    HARRY
          NO ... I...

     Quaid stares at Harry's HAND.  Fascinated, he momentarily
     forgets his pain.  He traces the lines with bloody fingers.

                    QUAID
               (quietly)
          My God.

                    HARRY
          What?

                    QUAID
          You've taken some strange
          journeys in your life.

                    HARRY
          Yeah.  You could say that.

                    QUAID
          You're drawn to the dark side, over
          and over.  And it's drawn to you.
               (looks at Harry)
          You don't like that.

                    HARRY
          Not much.

                    QUAID
          You can't change it.  You have to
          walk...
               (coughs)
          ...walk the line between Heaven and
          Hell.  It's your destiny.  Accept
          it.

     Harry takes his hand from Quaid's grip.  Quaid winces in
     pain.

                    HARRY
          Hold on.

                    QUAID
          I'm not afraid to die.  There's
          something terrible... coming
          home...

                    HARRY
          The Puritan?

                    QUAID
          Yes...

                    HARRY
          Who is he? 

     Quaid shudders, and dies.

                    HARRY
               (softly; sadly)
          Shit.

     He looks away, down at the CARDS.  All have been turned over
     but ONE.  He turns it.  The card is the Ten of Swords which
     pictures a prostrate man against a thunderous sky, pierced by
     all ten swords.  An image of death and desolation.

     EXT. QUAID'S OFFICES - ALLEY BEHIND BUILDING - NIGHT

     The flashing LIGHTS of two patrol cars illuminate the scene. 
     DETECTIVE EDDISON, a surfer-turned-policeman with buzz-cut
     blond hair, heads along the alley with Harry.  He's midway
     through taking Harry's statement. There are already two
     OFFICERS examining the drapes.  We can't yet see the body.

                    EDDISON
               (to Harry)
          What were you doing up there?

                    HARRY
          I'm a private detective.  I was
          hired to follow somebody for a few
          days.  A guy called Tapert.
          Insurance fraud.

                    EDDISON
               (writing)
          Tapert.  So, now I've got Tapert,
          Butterfield.

                    HARRY
          Tapert's got nothing to do with
          this.  He came here to get his palm
          read.

                    EDDISON
          What makes you so sure?

                    HARRY
               (shrugs)
          I got a file on him two inches
          thick.  He's a petty fraudster.
          This is something else.  Ever heard
          of someone called the Puritan?

                    EDDISON
          New one on me.
               (to Officer)
          Okay.  Let's see him.

     OFFICER #l shakes his head, and opens up the drape. Broken
     GLASS drops from the folds, but that's all. Miller has gone.

                    EDDISON
          Where the fuck is he?

                    HARRY
          He got up and walked.

                    EDDISON
               (looking up at window)
          After that fall?. He must have
          broken half his bones.

     WE MOVE IN ON HARRY, as he stares down at the drape.

                    HARRY
          I don't think he'd have given a
          shit.

                    CUT TO:

     INT. BUTTERFIELD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     The rooms are spartan.  Nothing on the walls.  Nothing on the
     floors.  Very little furniture. 

     Butterfield sits beside the window, obsessively combing his
     long hair.  There is something feminine about him now:  his
     voice a whisper, his stare distracted.  If we didn't guess it
     already, we're in the presence of a madman. 

     Miller is squatting against the wall, picking shards of GLASS
     out of his torso.  It hurts, but he's enjoying himself.

                    BUTTERFIELD
          D'Amour... D'Amour... Why do I know
          that name?

                    MILLER
          I know him.  I saw him.

     He stops to pull out a particularly large piece of glass,
     sighing with pleasure.

                    MILLER
          I saw him on T.V.  Some kid got
          possessed and he saved the little
          bastard's life.

                    BUTTERFIELD
          He's a priest?

                    MILLER
          No.  He's just a guy who's got a
          nose for this shit.
               (a beat.  A smirk)
          Like you.

     A long beat of silence.  Butterfield combs.  Miller digs for
     glass.

                    BUTTERFIELD 
          I don't want him getting in the
          way.

                    MILLER
          He won't. 

     Another silence.

                    BUTTERFIELD
               (dreamily)
          We've all of us waited too long to
          have the homecoming spoiled.

                    MILLER
          What do you mean, "all of us?"

                    BUTTERFIELD
          You didn't think it was just going
          to be you and me?  A lot of people
          believed in Nix. They haven't
          forgotten his promise.

     Venetian blinds shut out most of the sunlight, but a lamp
     burns on the desk (huge), showing us the furniture (leather),
     the books (innumerable), and the figure of SWANN, sitting
     behind the desk smoking a CIGAR.  He's lost some hair and
     some colour over the years, but he still has the same
     hypnotic eyes.

     He studies the L.A. TIMES in front of him.

     ON THE OPEN PAGE

     "Fortune Teller Brutally Murdered," the headline announces. 
     Underneath, a PHOTOGRAPH of Quaid's wrecked room.  WE CLOSE

               (softly)
          Hey... 

     He looks up, startled.

     DOROTHEA The sun's shining out there. Dorothea is dressed in
     a white robe now.  She literally brings light into this
     gloomy room.  On the shelves behind Swann are a number of art
     brut figurines, vaguely recalling the idols outside Nix's
     "temple."

          I just saw him.

     A difficult silence.  Then Swann crosses to the door.

                    SWANN
          I'm putting in a new illusion
          tonight.  Will you be there?

                    DOROTHEA
          Sure.  You want me to find out
          about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?

                    SWANN
          No.
               (superstitiously)
          I'm not going near him.

     INT. SWANN'S MANSION - LOBBY - DAY

     VALENTIN is overseeing the hanging of a new piece in Swann's
     collection:  a huge, framed POSTER from a late nineteenth
     century magic spectacular.  Valentin is fifty or so, his gray
     hair combed back close to his scalp. Immaculately dressed in
     a distinctively European fashion.  Precise.  Cautious. 
     Elegant. 

     He orders the TWO PICTURE-HANGERS in a clipped fashion.

                    VALENTIN
          Higher.  Another inch.  The left
          hand side's too low.

     Dorothea descends the stairs, dressed for the day.

                    DOROTHEA
          Valentin?

                    VALENTIN
               (to Hangers)
          Good.  There.
               (to Dorothea)
          Yes?

                    DOROTHEA
               (gives him the newspaper)
          You saw this?

     Valentin nods.  They walk back through the house together,
     while the picture-hanging goes on behind them.

                    DOROTHEA
          I want you to find this man D'Amour
          for me.

     She passes the newspaper to Valentin.  He looks down at it.

     INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

     Harry is sprawled on the bed, in his under shorts.  A shaft of
     sun darts between the drapes, missing his face by inches. 

     Somebody is knocking on the door, hard.

                    HARRY
               (waking)
          What...?

     He rolls over.  The sun strikes his eyes.  He winces.

                    HARRY
          Shit.

                    VALENTIN (V.O.)
          Mr. D'Amour?

                    HARRY
          Go away.

                    VALENTIN (V.O.)
          It's one in the afternoon.

                    HARRY
          What are you, my mother?

                    VALENTIN (V.O.)
          I need to speak to you, Mr.
          D'Amour.  About last night.

     Harry gets up and stumbles to the door.  He opens it a
     little.  The face of VALENTIN is visible through the crack.

                    HARRY
          Whatever I said, I didn't mean it,
          okay?  I get a few drinks inside me --

                    VALENTIN
          We've never met.

                    HARRY
          Then what do you want?

                    VALENTIN
          I'm here to offer you a job.

                    HARRY
          I'm going back to New York in--
               (consults his watch)
          Shit!  I'm outta here.

                    VALENTIN
          Have you got a job that'll pay you
          five thousand a day?

     A beat.  Then Harry takes the chain off the door.

                    HARRY
          Do I get lunch?

          Whose is the car?

                    VALENTIN
          Mine.

                    HARRY
          Nah.  You're driving it too
          carefully.

                    VALENTIN
               (sparring)
          Maybe I just bought it.

                    HARRY
          Somebody's been smoking in here for
          months.

     He pulls open the ashtray. Pulls out a cigar-butt.

          Havanas.  You're not the
          smoker.  So who is?

          Are you a gambling man?

                    HARRY
          When I can afford to lose. Swann's
          quite a magician.

                    VALENTIN
          Never call him that.  He's strictly
          an illusionist.

                    HARRY
          What's the difference?

                    VALENTIN
          Illusions are trickery. Magicians
          do it for real.

     The sedan turns into a driveway.

     EXT. HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY - DAY

     The sun beats down on a pristine panorama of palms and white
     marble tombs.  Harry and Valentin walk towards a large
     mausoleum.

                    HARRY
          Any movie stars buried here?

                    VALENTIN
          Probably.

                    HARRY
          It's not a bad place.  Warm.
          Great view.

                    VALENTIN
          I don't think the dead much care.

                    HARRY
          Are you sure?

                    VALENTIN
          Are you a believer, then?

     Valentin gives him an inquisitive look.

                    HARRY
          I've signed on for them all in my
          time.  Hindu.  Catholic. You can't
          have too many saviours.

     Harry's gaze is on the mausoleum now; or rather on the woman
     in white standing in its cool shadows:  Dorothea Swann.  She
     wears a wide-brimmed hat.

                    HARRY
          Who is she?

                    VALENTIN
          Swann's wife.

     VALENTIN sitting on the mausoleum steps reading a book.  He
     glances up. 

     Harry and Dorothea are wandering between the graves, deep in
     conversation.

                    DOROTHEA
          I want you to help me help my
          husband.  I know he's in some kind
          of trouble.  And it's something to
          do with the man you saw murdered.

                    HARRY
          Did your husband know Quaid?

                    DOROTHEA
          Yes.  They weren't close, but they
          saw each other once in a while.  I
          think Philip believes all that
          stuff with the tarot cards.

                    HARRY
          You don't?

                    DOROTHEA
          I think we make our own futures.

     Harry makes an approving MURMUR.

                    HARRY
          What's the connection?

                    DOROTHEA
               (covering now, but well)
          I don't exactly know. 
          Philip doesn't like to talk about
          the past.

                    HARRY
          Why not?

     Dorothea stops talking.  Takes off her sunglasses.  Her gaze
     is troubled, but direct.  There is an attraction between the
     two of them that simmers beneath the dialogue.

                    DOROTHEA
          He's a secretive man.

                    HARRY
          And you don't ask questions?

                    DOROTHEA
          We don't share our lives the way a
          lot of people do.

                    HARRY
          Does that mean...?

                    DOROTHEA
          We haven't slept in the same bed
          for years.

                    HARRY
          But obviously you still care what
          happens to him.

                    DOROTHEA
          We wouldn't be having this
          conversation if I didn't. Swann's
          one of the most remarkable men
          alive.

     Harry, frowns.

                    DOROTHEA
          You don't believe me.

                    HARRY
          He's an illusionist.  It's not
          exactly brain surgery. 

     Dorothea stares at him. 

                    HARRY
          Sorry.  You asked.

                    DOROTHEA
          No.  You're right.  He could have
          been something more. Maybe a lot
          more.  But people get lost.  Even
          good people. Too much fame.  Too
          much money,

                    HARRY
          Where do I sign? 

     Dorothea LAUGHS lightly.

                    DOROTHEA
          Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?

                    HARRY
          Harry.

                    DOROTHEA
          Harry.

                    HARRY
          I'm no bodyguard.

                    DOROTHEA
          That's not what I'm asking for. I
          want somebody who can find out what
          Philip saw in those damn cards. 
          And stop it from happening.

                    HARRY
          When do you want me to start?

                    DOROTHEA
          Come to the show with me. Tonight I
          want you to see him with an
          audience.  They love him.

                    HARRY
          Do you?

     The question catches Dorothea off guard.

                    DOROTHEA
          I didn't marry him for love, Mr.
          D'Amour.  Tonight?

                    HARRY
          Sure.

     Dorothea makes a little smile, and walks away.  Harry watches
     her go, exhaling an appreciative breath at the sight of her
     departing figure.

     Harry can't help but smile to himself.

                    LOOMIS
          I thought so.  'Night, Harry.

     Click.  Harry puts down the phone.  Glances at himself in the
     mirror.  Raises a rueful eyebrow.

                    CUT TO:

     EXT. WILTERN THEATRE - NIGHT

     CRANE DOWN from a looming STANDEE of Swann, perched above the
     theatre marquee.  SPOTLIGHTS rake the skies. The sidewalk
     below is jammed with AUDIENCE MEMBERS, STAR-SPOTTERS and
     PHOTOGRAPHERS.  This is a flashy, prestigious event.  LIMOS
     are disgorging scantily- dressed STARLETS and smiling MONEY
     MEN; a NEWS TEAM is interviewing audience members as they
     file in. 

     The atmosphere is noisy and excited.  Amid the throng, Harry. 
     He makes his way inside.

     INT. WILTERN THEATRE - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

     The atmosphere, is closer to a rock concert than a
     conventional stage show.  Security people with walkie-
     talkies roam the aisles; the audience buzzes with barely
     controlled hysteria. 

     Harry heads down the aisle, eyes on the stage.  A star-lit
     CURTAIN covers it.  Six rows from the stage is Dorothea,
     already in her seat.  She smiles lavishly, happy to see him.

                    DOROTHEA
          I'm glad you could make it. 

     Harry takes a seat beside her.

                    HARRY
          Hey, this is a big deal for me. You
          know what seats like this cost in
          New York?

     INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - NIGHT

     Center-stage, behind the closed curtains, Swann is ready for
     the opening of the show.  TECHNICIANS buzz around him like
     flies.

                    SWANN
          Valentin!

     Valentin emerges from the wings, patting the PANTHER that is
     waiting there.

                    SWANN
               (irritated)
          Valentin!

                    VALENTIN
          I'm here.

                    SWANN
          The guy with Dorothea.  Is that who
          I think it is? 

     Valentin nods.

     ON SWANN, his expression unreadable.

                    SWANN
          He's young.

     MUSIC strikes up.  A dramatic, Wagnerian chord. Valentin
     hurries away.  Swann's expression becomes very focused.

                    1ST TECHNICIAN
               (to Swann)
          Ready?

                    SWANN
          Ready.

     Swann rises up into the flies.

                    1ST TECHNICIAN
          How the fuck does he do that?

                    2ND TECHNICIAN
          It's wires, man.

                    1ST TECHNICIAN
          I never seen no wires.

                    2ND TECHNICIAN
               (sarcastic)
          So what is it?  Magic?

     INT. WILTERN THEATRE - AUDITORIUM AND STAGE - NIGHT

     The LIGHTS are DIMMING.  Harry glances across at Dorothea,
     whose gaze is intent. 

     The LIGHTS go OUT.  The MUSIC SWELLS, and the CURTAINS fly
     apart.  A spectacle worthy of Seigfried and Roy is about to
     blast our senses!  Magic for the 90's:  a wild, erotic ride
     into mystery.

                    SWANN (V.O.)
          Ladies and gentlemen.  You are
          standing on the threshold of a
          miracle...

     A vortex of SMOKE and LIGHT swirls in the middle of the
     stage. 

     The vortex BLAZES -- 

     And suddenly Swann SWEEPS DOWN out of the flies, as the floor
     of the stage opens and the head of a glittering, razor
     toothed DRAGON emerges in a cloud of CRIMSON SMOKE. 

     Swann raises his hands above his head and a SPEAR
     miraculously appears in his grasp.  He descends on the
     dragon.  It's a classic image:  St. Michael smiting the
     Devil.  Swann drives the spear down the throat of the dragon. 
     The theatre SHAKES at its dying ROARS.  Then the head cracks
     open, and out of the dragon's mouth emerge a dozen scantily
     dressed DANCERS, male and female.  Swann throws down the
     spear, and where it strikes the stage his PANTHER appears. 

     A ROAR of APPLAUSE from the audience.  Swann's plain white
     tunic falls away from him as he descends.  By the time his
     feet touch the stage he is dressed in a star- shot TUXEDO. 
     The PANTHER licks his hand in welcome. The MUSIC comes to a
     crescendo.  The DANCERS freeze in their erotic dance.  In the
     sudden hush, Swann speaks in a whisper.

                    SWANN
          My friends ... come with me...into
          the Great Beyond.

     A barrage of LIGHTS and MUSIC erupt. 

     The AUDIENCE APPLAUDS wildly. 

     ON HARRY and Dorothea.

                    HARRY
          He's good.

                    DOROTHEA
          You haven't seen anything yet.

     INT. WILTERN THEATRE - LOBBY - NIGHT

     The doors SQUEAK as a gust of WIND blows through them. 

     Butterfield stands in the lobby, listening to the muted
     SOUNDS of MUSIC and APPLAUSE.  Then he offers his ticket to
     the TICKET-COLLECTOR and steps inside.

     INT. WILTERN THEATRE - AUDITORIUM AND STAGE - NIGHT

     A new musical motif hangs in the air:  MUSIC announcing
     danger. 

     The AUDIENCE watches intently, nervously. 

     ON HARRY and DOROTHEA.

                    DOROTHEA
               (a whisper)
          This is the new illusion.

     ON STAGE, Swann is bound to a spinning WHEEL, while the
     DANCERS, dressed like Boschian DEMONS, cavort around him,
     somersaulting and leaping over eruptions of yellow FLAME. 
     It's a scene from Daniels Inferno.  Above him. a dozen
     glittering SWORDS - six feet long - are descending.  He
     struggles to free himself.  The MUSIC gets more exciting as
     the wheel spins faster and faster. 

     Suddenly, a sword DROPS.  It falls between Swann's
     outstretched legs, skewering the wheel.  Then ANOTHER, close
     to his head. 

     ON HARRY.  He's tense.  Excited. 

     BACK TO STAGE.  Swann is free I  He throws off the last
     shackle and uses it to thrust into the mechanism of the
     wheel.  There's a theatrical BLAZE of white-hot SPARKS.

     The wheel slows.  He starts to step off it, as another of the
     the swords DROPS. 

     The AUDIENCE GASPS.  Swann smiles, and TRIPS. 

     As he FALLS, the sword runs through the middle of his back,
     carrying him down to the still-spinning wheel, and pinning
     him there.  Some of the DANCERS continue to cavort.  Some
     stop. 

     More GASPS from the audience. 

     ON HARRY, having a -- 

     FLASHBACK:  Harry's hand turns over the final tar of card. 
     The scene on the stage is that image coming to life. 

                    HARRY 
          There's something wrong... 

     ON Swann, as a second sword FALLS, skewering his thigh, and a
     third, running through his buttock, and a fourth and fifth,
     until TEN SWORDS have entered his body. 

     ON THE AUDIENCE, not certain whether this is a trick or not.

     The MUSIC has stopped.  In the silence, somebody GIGGLES
     nervously.  A couple of PEOPLE break into APPLAUSE, but it
     dies away in a matter of moments.

     ON DOROTHEA AND HARRY

                    DOROTHEA
          No. . .

     ON THE STAGE, Swann raises his head and looks out at his
     wife, his eyes already glassy with imminent death.  He
     reaches out towards her, and then sags on the wheel, dead. 

     There are GASPS now from the audience.  Murmurs of disgust;
     sobs of horror.

                    1ST AUDIENCE MEMBER
          What happened?

                    2ND AUDIENCE MEMBER
          It's a trick.

                    3RD AUDIENCE MEMBER
          Somebody help him.

     The curtains start to close.

     ON Dorothea, tears of shock filling her eyes.

                    DOROTHEA
               (to Harry)
          I've got to get to him!

     The AUDIENCE is rising now, as the horror of what they've
     seen sinks in.  There is panic.  A few people have fainted. 
     One or two are even praying. 

     Harry carves out a path down to the stage for Dorothea
     against the flood of the exiting crowd.

                    HARRY
          Out of the way!  Out of the way!

     He helps Dorothea onto the stage, and lifts the curtain so
     she can duck beneath it.

     INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - NIGHT

     Chaos.  PEOPLE running, sobbing, puking; some simply standing
     watching.  Valentin is already at the body, with the STAGE
     MANAGER at his side.

                    VALENTIN
               (to Stage Manager)
          Get then out of here, for God's
          sake --

                    STAGE MANAGER
          You heard him!  It's not a fucking
          show!

     He starts to physically push the crowd back.  Harry grabs his
     arm.

                    STAGE MANAGER
          Who are you?

     Harry uses his grip to gently but efficiently move the STAGE
     MANAGER out of Dorothea's way.  She goes to Swann's body,
     which has been removed from the wheel.

     INT. WILTERN THEATRE - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

     The audience is clearing now.  But Butterfield is coming
     towards the stage, with an ambiguous look on his face. Is he
     enraged?  Or puzzled?  Or both?

                    MILLER
          Psst!

     Miller stands at an open door, leading below the stage.

     Butterfield enters.

     INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - NIGHT

     Dorothea kneels at Swann's side.  A few yards from her, Harry
     examines the mechanism of the wheel.

                    DOROTHEA
               (softly)
          Swann... 

     A DOCTOR appears.

                    DOCTOR 
          I'm a doctor.  Let me through. 

     The Doctor checks Swann's body.

                    DOCTOR
               (to Dorothea)
          I'm sorry...

     Harry has discovered a CABLE snaking down beside the device. 
     He's suspicious.  He slips round to the back of the
     mechanism, and climbs down beneath the stage, tracing the
     cable as he goes.

     WILTERN THEATRE - BELOW STAGE - NIGHT

     It's an eerie, shadowy space, filled with the PROPS that are
     used in the show, including the DRAGON we saw at the
     beginning.  From above we hear FOOTSTEPS and VOICES, muted
     and echoing. 

     The cable ends in bare wires.  Whatever was here has been
     taken. 

     A NOISE, behind Harry.  He swings round.  Sees a shadowy
     FIGURE ducking away.

                    HARRY
          Hey!

     He gives chase.  Loses the man in the shadows.  Stops and
     listens for movement. 

     Suddenly, Miller steps out of the shadows with a plank of
     wood and smashes it into Harry's face!

     Harry reels back.  Falls to his knees, BLOOD running from his
     nose.  Miller pulls Harry's GUN out of his jacket.

                    MILLER
          Got you, fucker!

     Harry is facing the dragon's head, dazed.  And now, out of
     the dragon's mouth, comes Butterfield. 

                    BUTTERFIELD
          Who did this, D'Amour?  Who killed
          Swann? 

     Harry is barely holding on to consciousness.

                    HARRY
          You did.
               (a beat)
          Didn't you?

                    BUTTERFIELD
          Why would I do that?

                    HARRY
          Beats me.

     Butterfield is a foot from Harry now.

                    BUTTERFIELD
          You don't have a clue what you're
          into, do you?

                    HARRY
          Deep shit? 

     Butterfield hits him.

                    BUTTERFIELD
          Who did this?

                    HARRY
          I told you --

     Butterfield hits him again.

                    BUTTERFIELD
          Who did this?

                    HARRY
               (raises his hand)
          All right.  It was...

     Butterfield comes a little closer.

                    HARRY
               (feigning a near collapse)
          ... it was...

     Butterfield leans in.  And Harry grabs him by the balls --
     literally -- rising as he does so.

                    BUTTERFIELD
          Aah!

     Harry THROWS Butterfield aside. Butterfield hits the ground
     in agony, and Harry swings round to protect himself from
     Miller, who's leveling Harry's gun. 

     He FIRES once, missing Harry by inches.  Harry catches hold
     of a ROPE underfoot and pulls it, tripping Miller, who
     TOPPLES backwards into the mouth of the dragon.  The GUN GOES
     OFF again, the bullet BLOWING APART the dragon's JAW
     MECHANISM. 

     Miller starts to sit up, his body splayed between the
     dragon's steel teeth.  He has Harry in his sights. 

     -- something CREAKS.  He looks up.  The dragon's jaw is
     closing, FAST.  He starts to scramble to his feet.  Too late! 
     The teeth SLAM CLOSED on his body.  Sudden death. 

     Harry looks round to see Butterfield retreating into the
     shadows.  Then he's gone.  Harry looks down at Miller's
     BLOOD, which is pooling around his feet.

                    HARRY
          Deep shit...

                    FADE OUT

                    FADE IN

     INT. POLICE STATION - EDDISON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     Harry sits at Eddison's desk, looking exhausted and bruised. 
     Eddison has just finished taking his statement.

                    EDDISON
          And this Butterfield guy--

                    HARRY
          --vanished.

                    EDDISON
               (frustrated sigh)
          Another fucking magician. Jesus.

     Harry looks past Eddison and sees an ashen, tearful Dorothea
     being taken into another office.

                    HARRY
          Are you finished with me?

                    EDDISON
          For now.  Are you planning to go
          back to New York?

                    HARRY
               (watching Dorothea)
          No.  Not yet...

     INT. POLICE STATION - OTHER OFFICE - NIGHT

     Dorothea sits alone, staring at the wall.  Harry enters.

                    HARRY
          Are they treating you okay?

                    DOROTHEA
               (nods)
          I heard what happened.  It looks
          like somebody murdered him.

                    HARRY
          I'm sorry I got into this too late. 
          But if you want me to stick around,
          maybe dig where the cops don't
          look...

                    DOROTHEA
          I don't know where you'd start.

                    HARRY
          Well... how about some of the other
          illusionists?

                    DOROTHEA
          They won't tell you anything.

                    HARRY
          I can be very persuasive.

                    DOROTHEA
               (a beat)
          Yes.  I think you probably can.
               (another beat)
          We'd need to talk about your fee.

                    HARRY
          Forget the fee.  If I find
          Butterfield, maybe we'll talk about
          money.  If I don't...
               (he shrugs)
          ...my gamble.  Either way... I
          get to spend some time... here.

     The way he says this, it's plain "here" doesn't mean L.A., it
     means near -Dorothea.  And by the tiny smile on her face,
     it's also plain she knows it.

                    CUT TO:

     EXT. MAGIC SHOP - HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - DAY

     Noon.  Bright sun.  Busy street.  Harry, now wearing a
     bandage on his cut face, enters.

     INT. MAGIC SHOP - DAY

     A wonderland for illusionists.  Books, props, masks, tricks,
     etc.  Two or three CUSTOMERS browse.  Harry glances at them
     all, then targets a MAN in late middle age, who is browsing
     through books, one-handed.  His other hand constantly
     manipulates a card, concealing and revealing it in a dozen
     ways.  He doesn't even look at his hand.  His name is WALTER
     WILDER. 

     Harry stands beside him.  Scans the shelf.

                    HARRY
          Where'd you learn that?

                    WILDER
          What?

                    HARRY
               (points)
          That.

                    WILDER
          At birth.  I don't know you --

                    HARRY
          Harry D'Amour.

                    WILDER
          I know all the kids coming up. Got
          to stay ahead of the game. But I
          don't know you.

                    HARRY
          I'm in from New York.  I came to
          see Swann.

                    WILDER
          What a tragedy.  It was just a
          matter of time, of course, but it's
          not good for the business.

                    HARRY
          Was he taking a lot of risks?

                    WILDER
          You don't know the half of it. I'm
          Walter Wilder, by the way.

                    HARRY
          Not the Walter Wilder? 

     Walter beams.

                    WILDER
          The one and only. 

     He hands Harry a card.

                    WILDER
          Want to try?

     Harry tries to emulate Wilder's card manipulation through the
     rest of this conversation.

                    WILDER
          You know Vinovich?

                    HARRY
               (not a clue)
          Sure.  Vivovich.

                    WILDER
          He knew Swann way back.  He says
          there were a lot of drugs, a lot of
          crazy shit.

                    HARRY
          I'd love to... you know... hang
          with some of you guys.

                    WILDER
          People are pretty cagey.  Who do
          you know?

                    HARRY
          For what?

                    WILDER
          For an introduction.

                    HARRY
          Well... nobody.

     Wilder takes a moment to assess Harry, who is attempting to
     manipulate the card he's been given with charming ineptitude.

                    WILDER
               (magnanimously)
          You do now.

     EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - DUSK

     The castle is faux, of course, but it has a Gothic charm. 

     Harry and Walter wander towards the front door.  Harry is
     knotting a newly-bought tie.

                    HARRY
          I only wear ties for funerals.

                    WILDER
          You don't get in without one. It's
          like a gentlemen's club for
          illusionists.  Except most of us
          aren't gentlemen.

     INT. MAGIC CASTLE - CORRIDORS - NIGHT

     The interior is murky and atmospheric, the walls covered with
     illusionists' posters. 

     Walter leads the way through the long corridors, past rooms
     where illusionists are performing close-up magic for
     audiences of well-heeled patrons.  Walter nods and waves to
     half a dozen people on their way through the house, up the
     stairs and towards the bar.

HARRY
          Are they all in the business?

                    WILDER
          It's not a business. Harry. It's a
          vocation. 

     Wilder points to a locked door.

                    WILDER
          That's what they call the
          Repository.  Every magic secret
          known to man's locked up in that
          room.

                    HARRY
          Have you been in?

                    WILDER
          No.  There's only three keys.
          Vinovich has got one, of
          course.
               (beat)
          He's a little crazy, by the way. 
          And he's a mean drunk. Otherwise,
          he's a real charmer.

                    CUT TO

     INT. MAGIC CASTLE - BAR - NIGHT

     Later.  A drunken VINOVICH is holding court.  He's in his
     40's:  a flamboyant and loquacious man with a heavy (and
     fake) middle-European accent.  At the table - besides Harry
     and Walter - are:  Vinovich's starlet/nymphet girlfriend
     LAURA; an Asian-American illusionist called BILLY WHO; and
     two of Vinovich's adoring courtiers, an overblown,
     overdressed female illusionist - DEBRA DEVINE - and a thin,
     waspish fellow in a spangly suit:  the AMAZING QUENTIN. 

     In the conversation that follows we go back to Harry
     repeatedly as he studies this extraordinary group.

                    VINOVICH
          It's more than entertainment. We're
          opening people's heads up.  Putting
          miracles back into their boring
          little lives.

                    BILLY
          But they're fake miracles.

                    VINOVICH
          Houdini believed he had spirit
          guides.

                    HARRY
          You believe that?

                    VINOVICH
          I think we walk a narrow path,
          between... between...

                    HARRY
          Heaven and Hell?

     Vinovich stares hard at Harry, trying to figure out whether
     he's being sarcastic or not.

                    VINOVICH
          Trickery and divinity.

                    HARRY
          Are you saying that sometimes
          the miracles are real?

                    VINOVICH
          No.  I'm saying they were always
          fake.  The saints, the messiahs,
          they were just illusionists.

                    HARRY
          So could you walk on water?

                    VINOVICH
               (deadly serious)
          I could reproduce any miracle
          that's ever been performed, with a
          little preparation.

                    HARRY
          What about Swann's miracles?

     The smug smile on Vinovich's face dies.  Furtive glances are
     exchanged around the table.  Only Billy Who makes a tiny
     smile.

                    VINOVICH
          They weren't worth a damn.

                    HARRY
               (goading)
          I heard he was the best.

                    VINOVICH
          If he was so good why's he so dead?

     Vinovich begins to look suspicious.

                    HARRY
          You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd
          maybe have a theory.

                    VINOVICH
          Oh, I've got plenty.

                    HARRY
          I'd like to hear them. 

     Vinovich rises.

                    VINOVICH
          I'm not saying another word.
               (to Wilder)
          You damn fool.  He's a
          journalist.

                    HARRY
          Just tell me about Swann.  Or are
          you too scared?

                    VINOVICH
          He was a freak.  Everything he did
          was tainted.

     Harry rises.  Looks straight at Vinovich, unintimidated.

                    HARRY
          With what?

                    VINOVICH
          Evil.  He was evil.
               (to Laura)
          Come on.

     She rises.

                    VINOVICH
               (to the rest)
          Say nothing to this man if you wish
          to keep my company.

     He stalks away.  Harry calls after him, across a now-
     silenced bar.

                    HARRY
          Great accent, by the way.  Is it
          Brooklyn?

                    VINOVICH
               (pure Brooklyn)
          Fuck you.

     EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     Harry heads to the car.

                    BILLY (V.O.)
          Harry!

     Harry turns.  Billy approaches, glancing behind him to see
     that he's not being watched.

                    BILLY
          I gotta be careful.  If Vinovich
          sees me talking to you.  He's an
          asshole, but he's a powerful
          asshole.

                    HARRY
          They go together.

                    BILLY
               (lowered voice)
          I've heard a name.  Someone they
          talk about in whispers.

                    HARRY
          Who?

                    BILLY
          Nix.

                    HARRY
          Nix?

                    BILLY
          Like in nothing.  Nobody.  Nix.

                    HARRY
          Who is he?

                    BILLY
          I think maybe he taught Swann.
               (hands Harry a card)
          This is me.  See ya around. 

     Billy hurries away.

                    CUT TO:

     INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

     Harry lies on his bed, dozing.  The CAMERA CREEPS IN on him.

                    DOROTHEA (V.O.)
          ... I want somebody who can find
          out what Philip saw in those damn
          cards... 

     Harry frowns in his semi-doze.

                    DISSOLVE TO:

     FLASHBACK - QUAID'S ROOM

                    BUTTERFIELD
          Ever watched a man die?

     The image darkens, and fades up a beat later on Quaid.

                    QUAID
          Please... I wasn't there... Ask
          Pimm.

                    BUTTERFIELD
          Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's
          disappeared...

                    BACK TO:

     INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

     Harry is still asleep.

                    CUT TO:

     FLASHBACK - QUAID'S ROOM

                    QUAID
          I'm not afraid to die.  There's
          something terrible... coming
          home...

     A long silence. 

     SUDDENLY, a telephone RINGS.

                    BACK TO:

     INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

     HARRY sits up, shocked awake.

                    HARRY
          Shit!

     He picks up the receiver.

                    HARRY
          This is D'Amour.
 
           
               CUT TO:

     INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     She sits up on her bed, dressed in a silk robe, and nothing
     else, drinking a SCOTCH, talking on the phone. The primary
     source of illumination is the massive T.V. set in the wall
     opposite the bed.

                    DOROTHEA
          Harry... I know it's late.

     INTERCUT PHONE CONVERSATION

     There should be a subtle eroticism pervading this exchange. 
     Both of them on beds, in different bedrooms. Each aroused by
     the other's voice, and frustrated not to be able to see and
     touch them.

                    HARRY
          That's okay.

     As he speaks, Harry scrawls Jennifer Desiderio on the title
     page of the Gideon's Bible beside the bed.

                    DOROTHEA
          How did it go today?

                    HARRY
          I went up to the Magic Castle. You
          were right.  He didn't have a lot
          of fans up there.

                    CUT TO:

     INT. SWANN'S MANSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT

     Valentin, on the kitchen PHONE, is listening in.

                    DOROTHEA (V.O.)
          They were jealous of him.

                    HARRY (V.O.)
          Why?  Because he had you?

                    BACK TO:

     INTERCUTTING: HARRY - DOROTHEA - VALENTIN

                    DOROTHEA
          He... didn't have me..  I told you-

                    HARRY
          You didn't marry him for love.

     DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM

     She's a little uncomfortable now.

                    HARRY
          So why did you marry him?

                    DOROTHEA
          That's my business. Harry.

                    HARRY
          Just curious.
               (a beat)
          Back to business.  Ever heard of a
          man called Nix?
               (silence)
          Dorothea?

                    DOROTHEA
          Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't
          know the name.

                    HARRY
          What about Jennifer Desiderio?

                    DOROTHEA
          It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to
          go.

                    HARRY
          Okay.  I'll keep digging.

                    DOROTHEA
               (uneasy)
          Yes.  You do that.

     She puts down the phone, and swallows a mouthful of scotch. 
     She's shaking.  She gets up.  Paces the room. Then she picks
     up the phone again.

     INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

     On the pad beside the bed, Jennifer's name, surrounded by
     Harry's doodles.  The phone RINGS. 

     CUT WIDE:  The room is empty.

     EXT./INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - STAIRWELL - NIGHT

     The Tarot Card and Crystal Readings sign is dark now. Harry
     heads up the stairs, past the PHOTOGRAPHS, to the door of
     Quaid's Waiting Room. 
     It has been locked and taped by the police.  Harry has come
     prepared.  He takes out a small crowbar and levers off the
     locks.

     INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - WAITING/FORTUNE TELLING ROOMS - NIGHT  

     Harry enters, FLASHLIGHT on.  He crosses the Waiting Room and
     enters the Fortune-Telling Room where Quaid died.  On the
     TRACK -- a remote, eerie presence -- we hear Quaid's SOBS,
     Miller's SHOUTS, and, as Harry's flashlight illuminates the
     blood-spattered table:

                    BUTTERFIELD (V.O.)
          If you watch very closely, you can
          sometimes see the soul escaping.

     Harry is spooked.  He starts to search the room, opening
     cabinets and drawers.  Quaid's hordes of mystical bric-a-brac
     are stashed everywhere.  Boxes of crystals, religious
     statues, elaborate cards, incense, etc.

     He pulls open a drawer, and notices that a rosary is wedged
     in a niche at the base of the drawer.  He pulls the drawer
     out, empties its contents on the table, and examines it. 

     Using the crowbar, he forces the drawer apart.  It has a
     false bottom.

                    HARRY
               (smiles)
          Yes...

     In the secret compartment, some papers and an address book. 
     He flicks to "D."

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          Desiderio...

     There it is.  Jennifer Desiderio, and an address.  He pockets
     the book.  Then, sensing a presence behind him, he pulls out
     his gun and whirls around, his flashlight beam revealing --

     -- Valentin!

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          What the fuck are you doing here?

                    VALENTIN
          Looking for you.  I tried the
          hotel.

                    HARRY
          Why'd you come here?

                    VALENTIN
          You're a detective, with no clues. 
          Where else are you going to look? 
          I'm going to keep this brief.
               (he takes out an envelope)
          Here's thirty thousand dollars.

                    HARRY
          What for?

                    VALENTIN
          A ticket home,

                    HARRY
          You didn't hire me.  She did.
          If she wants me off the job, I
          want to hear it from her.

                    VALENTIN
          She doesn't want to see you. She's
          had enough pain.  Enough churning
          over the past.  She wants it all
          left alone.

                    HARRY
          Left alone?  Somebody's been
          murdered.

                    VALENTIN
          Yes.  It's regrettable

                    HARRY
          Fuck regrettable!  I want to know
          why.

                    VALENTIN
          What for?  You need to stay busy?

                    HARRY
               (a confession)
          I like to know why things happen.

                    VALENTIN
          Why people die?
               (shakes his head)
          Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.

                    HARRY
          No.

     Harry crosses to the door, brushing past Valentin.

                    VALENTIN
          Don't try and see her, D'Amour.
          Just leave her alone.  Let her
          heal.

     He glances back at Valentin.

                    HARRY
          Lock up, will you?

                    CUT TO:

     EXT. ST. LUKE'S SANITORIUM, PASADENA - DAY

     ON THE ADDRESS BOOK, in Harry's hands.

     Harry looks up - with some surprise - not at a house but at a
     building, the sign on which reads, "St. Luke's Sanitorium".

     INT. ST. LUKE'S SANITORIUM - DAY

     The place is bland and functional throughout, the walls
     decorated with sun-faded reproductions of great paintings. 
     Nothing disturbing.  Harry is talking to D.A. TOFFLER -
     black, fortyish, softly spoken - and a Nurse.

                    TOFFLER
          Jennifer's only ever had one
          visitor.

                    HARRY
          A Mister Quaid?

                    TOFFLER
          Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I
          saw it on the news. Jennifer
          doesn't know.  And frankly, this
          isn't the best tine for her to be
          told.

                    HARRY
          I won't say anything.

     INT. ST. LUKE'S SANITORIUM - CORRIDORS AND WARD - DAY

     Toffler excorts Harry through -the place.  There are
     distressing scenes on every side.  Nothing melodramatic no
     screaming, no fits.  Just a subtle, pervasive air of despair. 
     Blank, empty FACES in blank, empty rooms.

                    TOFFLER
          Jennifer's been with us four years. 
          She was coming on nicely. 
          But just the last month or so,
          she's worse than ever.

                    HARRY
          What's her problem?

                    TOFFLER
          She has no real grip on reality.

                    HARRY
               (a joke)
          Does anybody?

                    TOFFLER
               (deadly serious)
          Oh yes.  We have to agree what's
          real and what's not. That's what
          holds us together.

                    HARRY
          And what does Jennifer think's
          real?

     They've come to french windows, which are wide open. Sitting
     outside in the sun is Jennifer, with her back to us.

                    TOFFLER
               (quietly)
          Jennifer thinks the Devil's coming
          for her.
               (louder)
          Jennifer?

     Jennifer turns.  She looks terrible.

     EXT. ST. LUKE'S SANITORIUM - GROUNDS - CITY STREET - DAY

     Harry and Jennifer walk amongst the flower-beds, with the
     Nurse keeping a watch from a discreet distance. Throughout
     the scene we HEAR the SOUND of earth being dug, which
     steadily gets louder as they walk.

                    JENNIFER
          Have we met before?

                    HARRY
          No.

                    JENNIFER
          Only I forget.  They give me pills,
          you know, to keep me... even...
          and... I forget things,

                    HARRY
          Well, you didn't forget me.  I just
          came because I wanted to know if
          you knew a man called Butterfield.

                    JENNIFER
          Maybe... I... don't...

                    HARRY
          What about Philip Swann?

                    JENNIFER
          I knew Swann.
               (sudden vehemence)
          He's a fucking liar.

     A WORKMAN saunters past, carrying pipes.

                    HARRY
          Why's that?

                    JENNIFER
          He said he knew how to protect us. 
          But he didn't know anything.  He
          made us think it was over and done
          with.

                    HARRY
          What is?

                    JENNIFER
               (tears nearing)
          I don't want to think about it. If
          I think about it he'll hear me. 
          He'll find me.

                    HARRY
          Swann?

     Ahead now, the site where the workmen are digging a hole,
     laying pipes.  The CAMERA doesn't focus on this action, but
     we're aware of it.

                    JENNIFER
          I told you.  I don't --

     She stops.  Looks ahead of her.  Her face is suddenly ashen
     and clammy.  Harry follows her gaze to: 

     The hole.  Somebody is in it, digging.  Earth emerges in
     shovelfuls, piling up beside the hole.

                    JENNIFER (CONT'D)
               (screaming)
          God no!  Oh God no!

     She backs away from the hole.  The Nurse grabs hold of her.

                    NURSE
          Calm down!

     She delivers the Nurse a backhand SWIPE.  The Nurse is flung
     back.

                    JENNIFER
          He's not going to get me!

     She races down towards the street.  Harry goes after her.

                    JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          He's not!  He's not!

                    HARRY
          Who's not? 

     He catches up with her.

                    JENNIFER
          Nix! Nix!

                    HARRY
          Is he the Puritan?

                    JENNIFER
          Yes! Yes!

                    HARRY
          And he's dead?

                    JENNIFER
          No.  He's coming back.  He's
          digging his way out!

     The Nurse appears behind Harry.

                    NURSE
          I'll take care of her now.

     Jennifer struggles in Harry's grip.

                    NURSE
          Let go of her, Mr. D'Amour!

     The Nurse breaks Harry's hold on Jennifer, who slips away
     instantly, racing towards the street.

                    HARRY
          Jennifer!

     She scrambles up over a wall, and flings herself from the
     top.  There's a SCREECH of brakes, then the smashing of
     metalwork and glass.  Harry gets to the wall before the
     Nurse.  Hoists himself up onto it.  Looks down.

     HARRY'S P.O.V. OF STREET

     Jennifer is dead in the middle of the street, beneath the
     wheels of a car.  The DRIVER is out, and yelling
     incoherently. 

                    HARRY
          Jesus.

     He slips back down the wall, and leans against it.

     He looks towards the hole.  The Workman has stopped digging. 
     His mud-encrusted hands emerge, and for a moment, before his
     head appears, the image is eerily like somebody climbing from
     a grave.  Harry closes his eyes.

                    HARRY
               (very quietly)
          Jesus.

     EXT. LOS ANGELES - DUSK

     The sun is setting, the city giving way to night.

     INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - DUSK

     Harry's on the phone.



                    HARRY
          I want to speak to Dorothea.

                    VALENTIN (V.O.)
          I'm afraid she's not in.

                    HARRY
          When will she be in?

     INT. SWANN'S MANSION - STUDY - NIGHT

     Valentin on the phone in the study.

                    DOROTHEA
          Who is it?

     Valentin puts the phone down.

                    VALENTIN
          Crank call.  I'll get the number
          changed.

                    DOROTHEA
          No word from D'Amour?                   

     Valentin shakes his head.

                    VALENTIN
          It's better he's gone.  He would
          have done more harm than good.

                    DOROTHEA
          Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think,
          so.  Try him again at the hotel.

                    VALENTIN
          I left three messages already.

     Dorothea nods, plainly sad at Harry's desertion.  She turns
     and leaves the room.

     INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

     ON BILLY WHO'S CARD, in Harry's hand.

                    HARRY
               (on phone)
          Billy?  It's Harry.  Suppose I
          wanted to get into the repository
          at the Magic Castle?

                    CUT TO:

     INT. MAGIC CASTLE - SKYLIGHT ROOM - NIGHT        

     THE PLACE IS EERIE BY NIGHT:  ALL MASKS AND SHADOWS. 

     PAN UP TO THE SKYLIGHT.  HARRY IS CUTTING AWAY A PANE OF
     GLASS.  BILLY'S BEHIND HIM.  THE PANE STARTS TO FALL. WITH
     LIGHTNING REFLEXES, BILLY REACHES THROUGH AND CATCHES IT.

                    HARRY
          You've done this before.

                    BILLY
          I've had my moments.

     INT. MAGIC CASTLE - HALLWAY OUTSIDE REPOSITORY - NIGHT

     Harry's manipulating the lock.

                    BILLY
          I'm sure they'll have this place
          rigged.

                    HARRY
          How?

                    BILLY
          It'll be something hokey. 

     CLICK! The door opens.

                    BILLY
          Houdini'd been proud of you.

     INT. MAGIC CASTLE - REPOSITORY - NIGHT

     Undusted shelves piled high with manuscripts, old books, and
     posters in every direction.

                    BILLY
               (impressed)
          Whoa...

     On the wall, plaster LIFE-MASKS.  In glass cases, the tools
     of the great magicians:  KNIVES, KEYS, GUNS, WANDS, even an
     IRON MAIDEN.  Billy is in awe.  He wanders around wide-eyed
     while Harry scans the shelves. The dialogue runs as they
     investigate.

                    BILLY
          I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.

                    HARRY
          You heard right.

                    BILLY
          You ever been married?

                    HARRY
          Yeah.  She was killed in a car
          crash.  Her lawyer was driving. She
          was filing for divorce.

                    BILLY
          Why?

                    HARRY
          My life was too weird for her.

                    BILLY
               (grinning)
          I love weird.

     Harry has seen a small SIGIL carved onto one of the shelves.

                    HARRY
          Billy?  This was on Miller's
          forehead.  Any idea what it is?

                    BILLY
          Nope.

     Harry presses it.  The entire bookcase opens up, CREAKING.

                    BILLY
          What did I tell you?  So fucking
          hokey.

     Inside, there is a small shelf.  On it, FILES and PAPERS.

                    HARRY
          What have we got here?

     Ever-eager, Billy steps into the recess.  And -- 

     two spiked, latticed gates close on his arm! 

     Harry grabs the gates before they snap closed, inches from
     skewering Billy's flesh and bone!  He keeps them open, his
     sinews straining.

                    HARRY
          Grab the files!

     Billy reaches in and pulls out a handful of the files. As he
     steps out of range. Harry lets go and the gates close with a
     CLANG!

                    BILLY
          Jesus!

     He slams the files down.  He's trembling.

                    BILLY
          I could have lost my fucking hands.

                    HARRY
          That would have kept you out of the
          Magic Circle.
               (he studies the files)
          Which was presumably the idea.
               (a beat)
          These are about Nix.

     Harry takes a sheaf of papers, and hands them to Billy.

                    HARRY
          You go through these.  Go on!

     Reluctantly, Billy does so.  Harry picks up a faded
     PHOTOGRAPH of the doorway to Nix's HOUSE (with the sigil
     painted on it) and BUTTERFIELD the child standing in the sun. 
     There are other CULTISTS standing around.  And in the DOORWAY
     -- a barely visible figure (and all the more intimidating for
     that) - is NIX.

                    HARRY
          Wait a minute...

     He stares at the boy's face.  The eyes are clearly different
     colours.

                    HARRY
          That's Butterfield...

                    BILLY
               (points to nan in)
          doorway)
          And who's that?

     ON HARRY, staring at the ambiguous presence. 

     ON THE PHOTOGRAPH of the shadowy figure.

                    HARRY
          At a guess?  The Puritan.  Nix.

     Billy picks up an ETCHING, water-stained and dirty.  It shows
     a horror we recognize:  a man's HAND pressed into the FLESH
     of another man's HEAD.

                    BILLY
          Take a look at this.

                    HARRY
               (looking at it)
          A Nix specialty?

     Billy is getting subtly spooked now.  He puts the etching
     down and starts to go through others in the series.  We
     glimpse them as he does so.  In one, a MAN regurgitates a
     serpentine form made of FLAME.  In another, a MAN stares at
     his own HAND which is STRIPPED OF FLESH.  There is no bone
     beneath.  Only a form of solid blackness.  In a third, we see
     a HEAD with a slit in the middle of the brow, emanating
     DARKNESS.

                    BILLY
          I don't know any of these tricks...

     Harry studies the etchings.

                    HARRY
               (a slow burn)
          Maybe they're not tricks.

                    BILLY
               (mystified)
          I mean, there's no instructions--
               (realizes what Harry said)
          What do you mean, they're not
          tricks?

                    HARRY
          What did Vinovich say? Something
          about walking a path between --

                    BILLY
          Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he
          says that all the time.

                    HARRY
          That's because he knew.  He'd seen
          these files and knew.

                    BILLY
          Knew what?

     Out of the corner of his eye. Harry sees a motion between the
     book-stacks.  Billy frowns.  Harry puts his fingers to his
     lips.  Gestures for Billy to take cover. Billy backs away. 
     Harry slowly turns in the direction of the motion. 

     Something eerily sepulchral is gliding between the stacks.  A
     figure in a straight-jacket with his head bowed.

     Harry takes out his gun. 

     Billy disappears around the back of one of the stacks. Harry
     goes after the apparition. 

     The TRACK is completely silent. 

     Suddenly, the creature appears behind Billy!  It looks up,
     its face that of a psychotic:  burning eyes, manic smile. 

     It tears open its straight-jacket and reaches for Billy, who
     backs away.

                    BILLY
          Harry!

     Books tumble on top of Billy as he stumbles against the
     shelves.

                    BILLY
          Where the fuck are you?

     Harry appears, and puts his gun to the PSYCHO'S head.

                    HARRY
          Okay.  Hold it right there.

     The gun goes through the Psycho's skull, as though it's made
     of smoke. 

     Harry waves his hands through it.  It's completely ethereal. 

     But it's still terrorizing Billy.

                    BILLY
               (in mortal terror)
          Get it off me!

     Harry glances around.  Sees a LIGHT flickering between some
     books.  FIRES at it.  The light goes out.  The "Psycho"
     vanishes.  Billy is left hyper-ventilating on the ground.

                    HARRY
          Hokey enough for you?

                    BILLY
          I'm out of here, man!  Are you
          coming?

     Harry picks up a handful of papers from the Nix file.

                    HARRY
          I'm coming.

     Billy is already out of the room.  For a moment. Harry pauses
     to look back at the other files, sealed behind the spiked
     gates. 

     As he does so --

     -- the proiector sparks into life one last time, and the
     "Psycho" appears --ROARING - at Harry's shoulder.

                    HARRY
          Ah, shaddup!

     He FIRES at the projector a second time.

     On the GUN SHOT --

                    CUT TO:

     EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - NIGHT

     Billy and Harry are parting.

                    HARRY
          Thanks, Billy.

                    BILLY
          Hey, anytime.
               (a beat)
          Actually, no.  This was enough. 

     They shake, and part.

     EXT. SWANN'S MANSION - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

     Harry waits on the doorstep.  Valentin opens the door.

                    VALENTIN
               (quietly)
          I can't let you in.

                    HARRY
               (stepping in)
          Yeah, I know.

                    VALENTIN
          You want more money, is that it?

     Harry pushes him aside.

     INT. SWANN'S MANSION - VARIOUS - NIGHT

     Harry starts to go through the house, opening doors.

                    HARRY
          Dorothea?

     He sees candle-light through a partially open door. Starts
     towards it.

                    VALENTIN
          Leave her alone --

                    HARRY
          Shut up!

     He pushes open the door.

     INT. SWANN'S MANSION - CASKET ROOM - NIGHT

     The room is a museum of Swarm's career.  Posters, and
     memorabilia everywhere.  And in the middle of the room,
     Swann's sealed CASKET, surrounded by flowers and candles. 
     Dorothea is standing beside it, head bowed.

                    DOROTHEA
          This is the way he wanted it... no
          autopsy, no embalming. Nobody
          meddling with his body...

     Harry approaches, slowly.

                    DOROTHEA
          Flesh is a trap.  That's what he
          used to say.  Flesh is a trap and
          magic sets us free.
               (a beat)
          Why did you come back?

                    HARRY
          I didn't leave.  I was just digging
          around.

     Dorothea looks up at him.

                    DOROTHEA
               (uneasy)
          What did you find?

                    HARRY
          Jennifer Desiderio, for one.
               (he watches her for a
          response)
          She threw herself in front of a car
          this afternoon.

     Dorothea can't disguise her distress.

                    DOROTHEA
          Oh Christ.

                    HARRY
               (a beat)
          Why don't you tell me the truth?

     INT. SWANN'S MANSION- STUDY-- NIGHT-

     Dorothea pours herself a drink, while Harry spreads the
     PHOTOS and the PAPERS from the repository on the table.

                    HARRY
          Nix ran some kind of cult, right? 
          Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?

                    DOROTHEA
          It was more than that, I think.

                    HARRY
          He was the real thing, right?

                    DOROTHEA
          Swann said he could do stuff, yes.

                    HARRY
          Stuff?

                    DOROTHEA
          He could get into people's heads. 
          Make them see things. Terrible
          things.  And he could levitate. 
          Juggle fire.

                    HARRY
          He taught all this to Swann?

                    DOROTHEA
          Some or it.

     INT. SWANN'S MANSION - HALLWAY OUTSIDE STUDY - NIGHT

     Valentin is listening at the door.

     INT. SWANN'S MANSION- STUDY-- NIGHT-

                    HARRY
          So Swann was performing magic. not
          illusions?
               (Dorothea nods)
          And what?  You thought he should be
          using it to cure cancer, not making
          millions.

                    DOROTHEA
          I told you --

                    HARRY
          Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess
          that'd turn anybody's head.
          Including yours.

                    DOROTHEA
          No.

                    HARRY
          You said you weren't with him for
          love.

                    DOROTHEA
          I wasn't.

                    HARRY
           What then?

                    DOROTHEA
          I was grateful to him.  I owed him
          my life.  And he loved me. He
          couldn't always show it, but he
          felt it.

                    HARRY
          He thought Nix was coming back,
          didn't he?

     Dorothea is pouring herself another drink.  The glass slips
     from her hand.  It SHATTERS.  Harry goes to help her.  They
     stoop together, very close.  The sexual attraction is almost
     palpable. Dorothea cuts herself on a shard of glass.

                    DOROTHEA
          Shit!

     They are very close to each other.

                    HARRY
               (reassuring)
          It's okay.

                    DOROTHEA
          No it isn't.  You can't help me.

                    HARRY
               (tenderly)
          I'm here, aren't I?

     He kisses her.  She kisses him back, hard.

                    HARRY
          Nothing's going to happen to you.  

                    DOROTHEA
               (seductive)
          Nothing?

                    HARRY
               (smiles)
          Nothing you don't want. 

     They kiss again, passionately.

     INT. SWANN'S MANSION - LOBBY - NIGHT

     Valentin breaks into the shadows, as Harry and Dorothea cross
     the darkened lobby and head upstairs.  Then Valentin crosses
     to the phone and dials.

     INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     A room of illusions.  Walls lined with mirrors, and warm,
     flattering lighting, bathing the naked forms of Dorothea and
     Harry as they make love, sitting on the floor.

     It is a deeply passionate, but slow, sensual coupling.

     INT./EXT. SWANN'S MANSION - LOBBY - NIGHT

     Valentin opens the front door.  There's a wind blowing. The
     palms churn against the night sky...

     INTERCUT

     Roiling, wind-filled pains with the glistening, urgent bodies
     of Harry and Dorothea.

     INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Harry cradles Dorothea in post-coital languor.

                    DOROTHEA
               (whispers)
          I was so afraid.

                    HARRY
          Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.

                    DOROTHEA
          Are you sure?

                    HARRY
          I'm sure.
               (kisses her)
          He's dead.

                    DOROTHEA
          I know.  I'm the one who shot
          him.

     ON HARRY. He's startled, to say the least.

                    DOROTHEA
          I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage,
          to get Swann to come to him.

                    HARRY
               (realizing)
          And they all came...

                    DOROTHEA
          Yes.

                    HARRY
          Quaid and Jennifer--

                    DOROTHEA
          And Pimm and Swann.  Only Nix was
          ready for them.

     There's a NOISE downstairs.

                    DOROTHEA
               (nervous)
          What was that?

                    HARRY
          It's okay. 

     Harry slips out of bed.

     INT. SWANN'S MANSION - STAIRS - LOBBY - NIGHT

     Harry descends the stairs, buttoning up his trousers (which
     is all he wears).  He has his gun.

                    HARRY
          Valentin? 

     Dorothea appears behind him.

                    DOROTHEA
          Harry?  Wait!

     Harry's at the bottom of the stairs now.  Across the hall, in
     a passageway, an eerie SILHOUETTE.  We can make out no detail
     of clothing or face.

                    HARRY
          What the hell-?

     Suddenly, the shadowy FIGURE comes at Harry.  A BLAST of
     ENERGY bursts against Harry's face.  As it breaks against his
     skin, we see (for three frames or so) a glimpse of Harry's
     skull.

                    HARRY
               (in pain)
          Aah!

     Harry FIRES at the figure.  The shadows fold up around the
     Stranger like an origami puzzle.  He's gone.

                    DOROTHEA
          It's him!  It's Nix!

     Harry goes out into the passageway.

                    HARRY
          Valentin!  Get some lights on!

     As if in reply to the command, a burst of vivid white FIRE
     erupts behind Harry.  He swings round to see the Stranger
     "unfolding" out of the shadows again, defying physics and
     physiology to do so.  The FIRE is at his feet, like a serpent
     writhing on the ground.  It comes at Harry.  Harry FIRES at
     it, but it comes at him faster still, rising to burn Harry's
     leg.  He retreats, the FIRE racing after him. He makes for a
     door, and flings it open.  He's in -- 

     INT. SWANN'S MANSION - CASKET ROOM - NIGHT     

     The FIRE follows him across the ground and STRIKES his hand. 
     Harry drops the GUN.  Looks up to see the Stranger in the
     doorway, arm raised to will the fire-serpent on.  But then,
     he hesitates.  Harry glances round, and sees that the
     Stranger - whose face is still a dark smear - is staring at
     the CASKET.

                    HARRY
          Somebody you know?

     Dorothea appears behind the Stranger.  Sees Harry, burned and
     sweating, cornered against the casket.

                    DOROTHEA
          Oh my God!

     The Stranger looks round.  Harry snatches up the GUN,
     supporting his burned hand with -his good hand.  Levels the
     gun at the Stranger.  The FIRE raises its head, like a cobra.

                    HARRY
          Which goes first?  My face or
          your heart?

     The Stranger draws a deep breath.  The Fire-Serpent withers
     and dies.

                    DOROTHEA
          Who in God's name are you?

     She reaches for the Stranger, who simply folds up again; gone
     into darkness.  The WIND blows through the house, masking his
     exit.

                    DOROTHEA
          Are you all right?

                    HARRY
          Find Valentin!  Find him!  Get him
          in here!

     Dorothea disappears.  Harry takes one of the candle-holders
     and jams it under the casket lid.  Wood splinters.  He starts
     to force off the lid. 

     Valentin and Dorothea enter.

                    VALENTIN
          What are you doing?  This is
          sacrilege.

     He starts towards Harry.  Dorothea goes after him and catches
     hold of his arm.  Her expression is a mingling of fascination
     and dread, as Harry gets his fingers under the casket lid and
     pulls. 

     Inside, Swann's corpse.

                    VALENTIN
          Are you satisfied now?

                    HARRY
          No.

     Harry holds Valentin back with one hand, and puts his finger
     into the corpse's mouth.

                    DOROTHEA
          Harry?

                    HARRY
          It's all right.  It's not
          hurting...

     He now has four fingers in Swann's mouth and seizes hold of
     his lower jaw.  It cracks -- 

     -- and comes away in a little rain of plaster and latex.

                    HARRY
          ...plaster doesn't bleed.

     He tosses the jaw to Valentin.

                    HARRY
               (to Dorothea)
          It looks like you're not a widow
          after all.

     INT. SWANN'S MANSION - STUDY - NIGHT

     Harry interrogates Valentin in a white fury, while Dorothea
     binds Harry's hand.

                    HARRY
          You rigged the illusion to fail,
          right?

                    VALENTIN
          Yes.

                    HARRY
          You paid off the doctor.  You set
          up the fake body.  Yes?

                    VALENTIN
          Yes.

                    HARRY
          And then... because I was
          getting too close to something --
               (at Dorothea)
          --or someone, you called Swann

                    VALENTIN
          I tried to pay you off.

                    HARRY
          Was that Swann's idea?

                    VALENTIN
          No.  It was mine.  I didn't want
          any more bloodshed. That's why we
          went to all this trouble, so
          there'd be no one for Nix to come
          after.

                    HARRY
          Nix is dead and buried, for
          fuck's sake.

                    VALENTIN
          Haven't you seen enough to know
          that doesn't matter?

     ON HARRY.  He looks as though he's beginning to think maybe
     Nix's resurrection is plausible.

                    HARRY
          I want to see Swann face to face.

                    VALENTIN
          Why don't you leave this alone? Let
          everybody think it's over?

                    DOROTHEA
          What about me?

                    VALENTIN
          Nix was never interested in you. 
          It was always Swann. 

     A beat.

                    HARRY
               (to Dorothea)
          Maybe Valentin's right.  We should
          let it alone. 

     A BELL starts to TOLL-

                    HARRY
               (con't.)
          He went to all that trouble to be
          dead.  Maybe we should let him stay
          that way.

     The TOLLING carries over into

     EXT. HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY - DAY

     WE CRANE DOWN from a high angle on a GRAVE, surrounded by
     MOURNERS.  The graveside service has just ended, and the
     Mourners are beginning to disperse.  Dorothea is there
     amongst them, of course.  So are several faces we recognize: 
     Vinovich, Wilder, Billy Who, Swann's Stage Manager, his
     Dancers, his Technicians.  There are also several members of
     the PRESS, and thirty or fourty other Mourners, some of whom,
     to judge by their dress and manner, are also illusionists. 

     Harry stands some distance from the crowd, watching (hidden)
     from the doorway of a mausoleum.  His eyes are on Dorothea as
     she goes amongst the Mourners, receiving unheard words of
     condolesence.

     EXT. WILTERN THEATRE - DAY

     The standee of Swann is being demolished by two WORKERS. They
     are taking hammers to it, smashing it to pieces.

     INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - DAY

     The stage is starkly lit with working lights, the auditorium
     in darkness.  Swann's equipment - including the partially
     dismantled Dragon's head - is heaped on the stage. 

     Valentin wanders through the boxes to the place where Swann
     "died."  He stares down at the BLOOD on the stage.

     EXT. WILTERN THEATRE - DAY

     THE 1st WORKER throws the cut-out head of Swann's standee
     down into the street.

                    1ST WORKER
          Watch out!

     On the HEAD, as it strikes the sidewalk at somebody's feet. 
     We don't see who.

     EXT. HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY - DAY

     Harry catches sight of somebody close to the gates of the
     cemetery.  Dark glasses, a beard, an anonymous black suit. 

     Harry smiles slightly, and slips off between the mausoleums.

     EXT. HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY - PARKING LOT - DAY

     The BLACK-COATED MOURNER gets into his car. 

     On Harry, as he gets into his.

     INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - DAY

     Valentin hears something in the auditorium.  Looks up.

                    VALENTIN
          Who's there?

     He reaches into his jacket to draw a GUN. There's a NOISE. 
     He swings round.  Too late.

     Butterfield has a scalpel at his throat.  He kicks Valentin
     to the ground.

                    BUTTERFIELD
               (conversationally)
          I've sometimes thought, if I'd had
          another profession, I would have
          been a surgeon.

     On Valentin, staring up in terror. 

     Valentin's P.O.V.- of Butterfield, upside down, above him,
     the scalpel glittering.

                    BUTTERFIELD
          To be able to heal with one little
          cut.

     On Valentin again, as Butterfield's blade touches his cheek,
     just beneath his eye.

                    VALEMTIN
          No. . .

                    BUTTERFIELD
          Let's say those eyes of yours were
          giving you trouble.

                    VALENTIN
          Please.

                    BUTTERFIELD
          I could scoop them out.

                    VALENTIN
          Don't.

                    BUTTERFIELD
          So tell me where Nix is buried.

                    VALENTIN
          I don't know.

     Butterfield pushes the blade into Valentin's skin. 

     CUT WIDE, as Valentin thrashes, his face obscured by
     Butterfield's body.

                    VALENTIN
          Wait!

     On Valentin again.  There is a small cut beneath his eye, but
     that's all.

                    VALENTIN
          I'll tell you.

                    BUTTERFIELD
          You'll do more.than that.

     EXT. L.A. STREET - SEMI-DERELICT BUILDING - DAY

     A bad neighborhood, to judge by the state of the streets. 
     Harry gets out of his car and crosses to a gate, topped with
     barbed wire.  He peers through the bars. 

     Harry's P.O.V. of the STRANGER from the funeral disappearing
     into the building.  He glances back towards the street.  We
     get a glimpse of a bearded face beneath the brim of his hat. 

     Harry slides out of sight.  Waits until the Stranger has gone
     inside.  Then he's up, over the gate, braving the barbed
     wire.

     INT. -SEMI-DERELICT BUILDING - DAY             

     It's been a hospital.  Now the echoing corridors and wards
     are deserted, littered with reminders of old suffering. 
     Rotting mattresses; spilled boxes of surgical supplies. 

     Harry explores this tiled labyrinth, looking for some sign of
     the Stranger. 

     He enters a shadowy room.  Birds fly UP into his face! 

     As he retreats, another SOUND, a little distance from him. 
     GUN in hand, he heads towards it, and steps into

     INT. SEMI-DERELICT BUILDING - OPERATING THEATRE - DAY

     Narrow shafts of light through the circular viewing window
     fall on an operating table, and looming pieces of discarded
     equipment.  Eerie.  Disturbing. 

     Harry scans the shadows as he advances into the room.

                    HARRY
          I knew you wouldn't be able tn stay
          away.

     Silence.  Harry notices the beard and glasses on the
     operating table.

                    HARRY
          You had to see who wept for you the
          most.

     Silence.

                    HARRY
          A lot of people are going to be
          really pissed off when they
          discover you're still alive.

                    SWANN (V.O.)
          They'll never find out. 

     Harry looks up.

     Svanrt is hovering in the air above him.  The veins in his
     temples bulge and throb.  This trick requires a lot of
     concentration.

                    HARRY
          Look, Ma, no wires.

                    SWANN
          You shouldn't have followed me,
          D'Amour.

                    HARRY
          How the fuck do you do that?

                    SWANN
          Now I'm going to have to kill you.

                    HARRY
          I don't think so.  You need me
          alive.

                    SWANN
          Why?  So you can fuck my wife?

     Swann swoops down towards Harry, who levels his gun.

                    HARRY
          Be careful.  Funerals make me
          trigger-happy.

     Swann stops, inches from the ground.

                    HARRY
          You know, it's such a fucking
          waste.  You can do shit most of us
          can only dream about, and you go
          around pretending it's some trick.

                    SWANN
          Illusionists get. Las Vegas
          contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get
          burned.

                    HARRY
          Or murdered, like Nix.

                    SWANN
          He deserved it.

                    HARRY
          Maybe he doesn't see it that way. 
          Maybe he's digging his
          way out of the hole you put him
          right now.  That's what you're
          hiding away from, isn't it?

                    SWANN
          I did it for Dorothea.

                    HARRY
          Oh yeah?

                    SWANN
          Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's
          off her.

     Harry grabs Swann, literally pulling him down to earth. Now
     they're face to face.  Eye to eye.  Swann, for all his
     posturing, is afraid.

                    HARRY
          So Nix won't come looking for her?

                    SWANN
          It's me betrayed him.

                    HARRY
          And she shot him I  I think that'd
          piss me off if I were Nix.

                    SWANN
               (despairing)
          I don't know what else to do.

                    HARRY
          Help me.

     On Swann, his face a churning mass of rage and fear.

                    HARRY
          Listen.  If he's back from the
          dead, then he is some kind of god. 
          And he'll find you, wherever the
          fuck you are. 
          And if he's just another phony
          Messiah, then you can stage the
          greatest come-back in history.

     ON Swann.  This doesn't sound like such a terrible idea.

     EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

     A car comes to a halt outside the house, where six vehicles
     are already gathered.  The SNAKE-HANDLING Cultist gets out. 
     SNAKES seethe out of the open car door.

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - VARIOUS - LATE AFTERNOON

     We MOVE THROUGH the shadowy interior, catching sight of
     several CULTISTS as we go.  They all have looks of barely
     suppressed ecstasy on their faces. 

     We are moving towards the Sanctum, and it's getting darker. 
     A MATCH is struck, and an OIL-FLAME sputters into life.  We
     see NORMAN'S gleaming face. On the wall is a PICTURE of Nix,
     floating over a scene of apocalyptic destruction. 

     Norman brushes away thirteen years' accrual of DIRT. Beneath,
     Nix's expression is as rabid and terrifying as ever.  Norman
     grins.

                    CUT TO:

     EXT. LIQUOR STORE - LATE AFTERNOON

     A small, garishly-lit liquor store.  Harry's car pulls into
     the lot.  Swann gets out, his disguise back on. Heads into
     the store.  Harry, agitated and impatient, follows him.

     INT. LIQUOR STORE - LATE AFTERNOON

     Swann is at the cashier's desk, with a bottle of cheap
     brandy.

                    SWANN
          Is this the best brandy you've
          got?

                    CASHIER
          If that's what's on the shelves.

     Swann produces a thousand dollar bill out of thin air.

                    SWANN
          Can you change a thousand for me?

                    CASHIER
               (amazed)
          You're shittin' me.

                    HARRY
          Can we go?

     Swann starts to COUGH.  A QUARTER falls from his mouth.

                    HARRY
          Oh Jeez.

                    SWANN
          Will that do?  No?

     Swann coughs again.  Puts his hand to his mouth.  A DELUGE of
     QUARTERS runs between his fingers.

                    SWANN
          That better? 

     The Cashier gapes.

                    CUT TO:

     EXT. SWANN'S MANSION - POOLSIDE - GROUNDS - DUSK

     The house could not look more reassuringly calm.  A SWAN
     struts beside the pool.  A long, HUSHED MOMENT...

                    SHOCK CUT TO:

     DOROTHEA'S DREAM

     A BABOON SHRIEKS, its mouth filling the frame. 

     CUT WIDE, to reveal the Baboon, racing around Nix's Sanctum,
     crazed. 

     Hanging on the sculpture that swings from the roof is a
     shadowy figure.  Is it Nix?  We can't quite see.  Black BLOOD
     runs from the figure and splashes on the ground.

     NOW WE SEE DOROTHEA, being pulled by the Cultists towards the
     falling gouts of dark fluid --

     -- she struggles, SOBBING --
                CUT TO:

     INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     She tosses around on the bed

                    BACK TO:

     DOROTHEA'S DREAM

     -- Dorothea has a GUN in her hand.  The Cultists shake it
     from her grip, and pull her directly under the BLOOD -- as it
     SPLASHES on her upturned face --

     INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     A SOUND. Dorothea wakes, distressed by the dream.  She gets
     up and goes out onto --

     INT. SWANN'S MANSION - LANDING - DUSK

     Looks down the stairs.

                    DOROTHEA
          Who's there?

     Silence.  Then, Valentin speaks behind her.  She jumps.

                    VALENTIN
          I'm sorry.

     BLOOD runs from his cut face.

                    DOROTHEA
          Jesus.  Valentin.  What did you do
          to your face?

                    BUTTERFIELD (V.O.)
          It was me.

     She turns.  He's on her in a heartbeat, pressing her back
     against the wail.

                    BUTTERFIELD
          Guess who we're going to see?

     INT. HARRY'S CAR - DUSK

     Harry drives.  Swann takes a throatful of brandy.  Then he
     stares at Harry.

                    SWANN
          You think I'm an asshole.

                    HARRY
          Didn't know you read minds.

                    SWANN
               (a warning)
          I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. 
          But you know that.
               (an apology)
          So I like playing games with
          people.  Gives them something to
          wonder about...

                    HARRY
          Is that all?

                    SWANN
          I distract them from their banality
          for a few minutes. It's like a
          public service.  It doesn't mean
          much in the end. They're all going
          to die.

                    HARRY
          And you're not? 

     Silence for a moment.

                    SWANN
          Oh, I was going to discover the
          secret of the universe.  That's why
          I liked Nix.  He promised me all
          these explanations.

                    HARRY
          And he didn't have them?

                    SWANN
          He had something.  He showed me how
          to bend the rules.  A little
          levitation.  A few fireworks.

                    HARRY
          Is that all?

                    SWANN
          No.
               (a beat)
          At the end... when we had him
          cornered, he got into my head. He
          showed me what we really look like,
          when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. 
          Shit...

                    HARRY
          And you believed him?

                    SWANN
          I saw it with my own fucking eyes! 
          See, that's his best trick.  No
          illusions.  Just the truth.
               (he looks at Harry)
          Are you ready for that? 

     Harry grabs the brandy bottle from Swann.

                    SWANN
          Hey!

     Harry drinks.

                    SWANN
          Thought not.

     EXT. SWANN'S MANSION - NIGHT

     PAN DOWN from the palms to Harry's car, outside the front
     door.

     INT. SWANN'S MANSION - VARIOUS - NIGHT

     Harry puts his head in the study, the library, the bedroom.

                    HARRY
          Dorothea?

     Now he's on the landing.  Swann's below.

                    SWANN
          She's not here.

     Harry spots Valentin's BLOOD on the carpet.

                    HARRY
          Did she know where Nix was buried?

                    SWANN
          No.

                    HARRY
          Who else did?  Did Valentin?

                    SWANN
          Yes.

                    HARRY
          Jesus!

     EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT      

     Butterfield's SEDAN crosses the desert, under a sky full of
     stars.

     INT. BUTTERFIELD'S SEDAN - NIGHT       

     Valentin drives.  Butterfield and Dorothea are in the back. 
     Dorothea is handcuffed. 

     He has a bag open at his feet.  One by one he takes out a
     series of extraordinary instruments.  Dorothea looks on,
     confounded.

                    BUTTERFIELD
          Like the look of these?  I made
          them myself, to set him free.

                    DOROTHEA
          Why did you wait so long?

                    BUTTERFIELD
          I didn't have the skill to
          resurrect him.  I had to teach
          myself.  And that took time.

                    DOROTHEA
          And you think he'll be in a fit
          state to resurrect, after thirteen
          years?

                    BUTTERFIELD
          If he was just a man like me, then
          no.  But he's not.

                    DOROTHEA
          What is he?

                    BUTTERFIELD
          Maybe he'll show you.

     ON DOROTHEA, terror in her eyes.

     EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Now there are a dozen vehicles parked around the house.
     Through the windows, the flickering of oil-lamp FLAMES.

     There is a low, ominous CHANT floating from the house.

     It has no words, but it is steadily BUILDING in intensity. 
     We DRIFT towards the front door.

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

     Now we move down the passageway to the Meditation Room.

     Inside, SEVENTEEN CULTISTS kneel in a circle.  They are all
     CUTTING OFF THEIR HAIR, and throwing it into the FIRE that
     blazes in the centre of the circle.  They hack
     indiscriminately, with KNIVES, SCISSORS and RAZORS, their
     eyes wild.  BLOOD runs down their faces and necks from nicked
     ears and scalps.

     And still the CHANT BUILDS, and BUILDS...

                    NORMAN
          He will come!  He will come! He
          will come!

     EXT. DESERT - NIX'S GRAVE - NIGHT

     Wide.  A few rocks, and emptiness. 

     The headlamps of Butterfield's sedan burn in the darkness,
     illuminating the dig.  Valentin is in the grave, digging. 

     ON Butterfield, as he stands at the edge of the hole,
     watching the work.  Dorothea stands a yard or two behind him.

                    BUTTERFIELD
          Anything?

                    VALENTIN (V.0.)
          Not yet.

     Butterfield squats at the edge of the hole and suddenly
     reaches out for Valentin, hauling him close.

                    BUTTERFIELD
          If you've lied to me to me --

                    VALENTIN
          I swear... this is the place Swann
          told me about.  The rocks...

     On Dorothea, who uses Butterfield's distraction to take a few
     steps back towards the open car door. 

     Dorothea's P.O.V. of Butterfield, back to her, interrogating
     Valentin.

                    BUTTERFIELD
          Five more minutes.  Hear me? And
          you'd better not --

     A SOUND behind him.  Butterfield wheels round.  On the ground
     beside the open car door, the instruments.

                    BUTTERFIELD
          What the fuck are you playing at?

     He goes to pick them up.  Dorothea steps from behind the
     door, with the sharpest in her hand.  She slashes at him. 
     Opens a WOUND across his arm.

                    BUTTERFIELD
          Aah!

     He comes at her suddenly, striking the instrument from her
     hand, and slamming her against the car.  He hits her.  Once.
     Twice.  Then --

                    VALENTIN (V.O.)
          Butterfield!

     Butterfield goes to the edge of the grave, picks up the
     flashlight and trains the beam on Valentin.

                    VALENTIN
               (blinded)
          In the corner...

     The beam goes to the corner of the grave. 

     A mummified HAND is sticking out of one of the walls.

                    BUTTERFIELD
               (to Valentin)
          Keep away from it.

     Butterfield jumps down into the grave, and goes to the hand. 
     The TRACK is silent, but for Butterfield's shallow breath. 
     He reaches out to touch Nix^s fingers...

     Closer... 

     Closer... 

     He touches the hand - and the wall of sand comes down with a
     ROAR!

     He jumps back as Nix's corpse, his head still sealed by the
     mask rolls into view.

                    VALENTIN
          Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!

                    BUTTERFIELD
               (reverentially)
          It's him... it's him.

     On Dorothea, sliding down the car in despair.

                    CUT TO:

     INT. HARRY'S CAR - NIGHT

     The car is static; the engine still running.

                    HARRY
          They got here before us.

                    SWANN
          Looks that way.

     EXT. NIX'S GRAVE - NIGHT

     Harry gets out of the car and starts towards the open grave.

     HARRY'S MOVING P.O.V. OF THE GRAVE

     Harry reaches the grave's-edge.  It's totally dark.  He peers
     in.  On his heel, as the ground CRUMBLES beneath his weight. 
     Harry slides into the grave.

                    HARRY
          Shit!

     He's in darkness now.  He gets to his feet, and starts to try
     and scramble out.

                    HARRY
          Swann?  Swann!

     Silence.

     Suddenly, a hand is laid on his shoulder!  Harry swings
     round.  It's Valentin.  He has been badly cut up. 

                    VALENTIN
          D'Amour --

                    HARRY
          Shit...

                    VALENTIN
          Help me.

     He collapses into Harry's arms.

                    HARRY
          Swann!

     INT. HARRY'S CAR - NIGHT

     Indecision is written all over Swann's face:  to help or not
     to help?

                    HARRY (V.O.)
          Swann!

     He decides.  Gets out.

     EXT. NIX'S GRAVE - MIGHT

     Swann goes to the graveside, terrified.

                    HARRY
          Give me a hand.  I got Valentin.

     Together, Harry and Swann lift Valentin out of the grave and
     lay him in the blaze of the headlamps.

                    VALENTIM
          He's got Dorothea. 

                    SWANN
          And Nix?

                    VALENTIN
          Him too.

                    HARRY
          We've got to get you to a hospital.

                    VALENTIN
          Don't bother.

                    HARRY
          Shut up.  We've lost enough lives
          already.

                    VALENTIN
          I'm sorry, D'Amour...

                    HARRY
          What about?

                    VALENTIN
          ... Looks like you're going...
          to lose... one more.

     Valentin dies.

                    HARRY
               (despairing)
          ... no...

                    SWANN
          He's better off this way.

                    HARRY
               (furious)
          Nobody's better off this wav!

                    SWANN
          You don't get it, do you? We're
          shit. D'Amour.

     He puts his foot beneath Valentin's body.  It rolls back into
     Nix's grave.

                    SWANN
          That's where we're all going.

                    HARRY
          In my time, and nobody else's.

     ON THE EMPTY GRAVE, as we HEAR the SOUND of Harry and Swann
     getting into the car.  The doors SLAM.  The CAR LIGHTS
     retreat.  The grave is left to DARKNESS.

     EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     The house is silent now.

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAYS - NIGHT

     We TRACK through the house.  The CULTISTS, all Seventeen of
     them, stand in the passageways, looking toward Nix's sanctum.

     ON THE SANCTUM DOOR.  Butterfield emerges.  He is wearing
     WHITE now.

                    BUTTERFIELD
          Do you wish him to be amongst us?

                    CULTISTS
          Yes...

                    BUTTERFIELD
          Will you come to him on your
          knees?

                    CULTISTS
          Yes...

                    BUTTERFIELD
          Be ready.

     Now we see that the Cultists have BOTTLES in their hands. 
     With looks of ecstatic fervour on their faces, they SMASH the
     bottles to the ground at their bare feet. Then they pick up
     MORE BOTTLES, and SMASH them, littering the ground with razor
     sharp pieces of GLASS. 

     ON Butterfield, smiling.  He steps back into the Sanctum.

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT

     HIGH, WIDE SHOT of the room, as Butterfield approaches the
     BODY of Nix.  It lies on a table, surrounded by bowls of OIL. 
     Bandages, soaked in oil, are laid over its limbs.  Beside its
     head, Butterfield's INSTRUMENTS are laid out. 

     ON Dorothea, crouched in the corner of the room, terrified as
     she watches Butterfield remove the multi- part MASK screwed
     into Nix's face.  He works with surgical precision.

                    DOROTHEA
          Listen.  You've got everything you
          want.  You don't need me. .. 

     A piece of the mask comes away from the cheek.  A subtle
     POWER plucks at dust around the room, disturbing it minutely. 
     We CUT CLOSE to Dorothea's face throughout this sequence (on
     occasion her eyeball fills the screen) as she sees these
     signs of disturbance in the ether, growing in magnitude.

                    BUTTERFIELD
          No, but he will.  After what you
          did to him.

     He pulls a piece of the mask from Nix's mouth.

                    BUTTERFIELD
          He'll want vengeance.  Simple PS
          that.

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAYS - NIGHT

     The bottle-breaking has ceased.  The Cultists stand,
     breathless with anticipation.

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT

     On Nix's emaciated mouth.  The lips TWITCH. 

     On Dorothea.  The DUST moves around her. 

     And Nix DRAWS BREATH. 

     On Butterfield, TEARS in his eyes.

                    BUTTERFIELD
          Oh my Lord.  He's coming home...

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

     The whisper runs through the congregation:

                    CULTISTS
          He's coming home... he/s coming
          home...

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT

     ON Dorothea, eyes wide.

                    DOROTHEA
          Christ in Heaven.

     ON Nix, as his body starts to thirstily soak up the oils. 
     His withered flesh starts to REHYDRATE; his veins start to
     THROB. 

     Butterfield is watching the process in amazement. Nix's HANDS
     move up to his face, where the last portion of the mask is
     still screwed over his eyes.

                    BUTTERFIELD
          He's with us...

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

                    CULTISTS
          He's with us... He's with us...

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT

     Unnoticed by Butterfield, who has his eyes on Nix, Dorothea
     gets to her feet and creeps away to the door. Very quiet
     TRACK. 

     Suddenly, the snake-handling Cultist steps into view, snakes
     coiled around his face and fingers!

                    DOROTHEA
          Oh God!

     Butterfield looks up. 

                    BUTTERFIELD
          Hold her!

     On Nix, as he starts to pull at the mask on his face.  It
     comes away with a moist, WRENCHING SOUND.  At last, we see
     his eyes.

     NIX'S P.O.V.

     The candle-lights blaze, BLINDING his sensitive eyes.

                    NIX
               (fury to agony)
          Aaarrrgh!

     He gets up and flings himself around the room, knocking over
     all the lights but two.  Then he strikes Butterfield to the
     ground, and slams his foot on Butterfield's neck, knocking
     him unconscious.  It's a terrifying, almost demoniacal
     display of instant physical superiority.  Throughout, he
     literally ROARS in rage.

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

     The Cultists SCREAM in sympathy, letting out years of
     repressed frustration.  Many of them are dancing on the
     shards of glass now, crazed.

                    CUT TO:

     EXT. DESERT NEAR NIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Harry's car is parked a quarter mile from Nix's house. He is
     getting out.  Swann stays put. 

     The SOUND of SCREAMING is carried towards them on the wind.

                    HARRY
               (spooked)
          Jesus... what the hell's going on
          in there?

                    SWANN
          At a guess... they just resurrected
          him.

                    HARRY
          Fuck.

     Harry starts towards the house. After a beat, Swann gets out
     of the car and follows.

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM- - NIGHT

     On Butterfield, as Nix removes his foot.  Butterfield is out
     for the count. 

     On Nix, as he stops screaming.  His face is grotesquely
     disfigured by the mask, the flesh stained and corrupted. 

     The SCREAMING of the Cultists is dying away.

                    NIX
          Children...

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

     The Cultists all face the Sanctum door, awaiting instruction.

                    NIX
          Will you suffer to come unto me?

     One by one, the Cultists fall to their knees.  We never see
     flesh pierced by broken glass.  But we HEAR IT, and see the
     agony on the Cultist's faces.  They start to sob.

     Then, Nix appears in the doorway, mostly hidden by shadow.

                    NIX
          I've come back to share the wisdom
          of the grave.  Will you hear it?

                    CULTISTS
          Yes... yes...

                    NIX
          Follow me then.

     He steps out of the doorway.  The Cultists let out sobs of
     adoration.  Nix locks at Dorothea.

                    NIX
          Do I know you, child?

     He reaches for her.  Pulls her close to his body. Dorothea
     keeps her self-possession; but only just.

                    NIX
          Oh yes... I do, don't I?  No gun
          this time, child?
               (a beat)
          Where's Swann?

                    DOROTHEA
          I don't know where he is.

     Nix picks her up, so that her feet are inches off the ground.


                    NIX
          He'll come.  We've got unfinished
          business, he and I.

     Then he carries her down the passageway to the Meditation
     Room, walking on the glass, apparently indifferent to the
     wounds he's receiving. 

     The Cultists follow.

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

     Nix strides into the middle of the room.

                    NIX
               (whispered to Dorothea)
          Something terrible's going to
          happen.  But if you hold on to me,
          very tight, you may live a little
          longer.

     The Cultists enter the room, knees and hands BLOODY.

                    NIX
               (to Cultists)
          Are you ready for my wisdom?

                    CULTISTS
          Tell us... tell us...

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT

     Harry pushes open the window, and climbs in.  Swann follows. 
     He is frozen by the memory of what happened here. 

     ON SWANN, as the TRACK fills with eerie ECHOES of that
     terrible event.  Nix's SCREAMS.  The GUN-SHOTS.  The sound of
     the SCREWS GRINDING into Nix's flesh.

                    SWANN
               (in terrified awe)
          This is where we killed him.

                    HARRY
               (looking at table)
          You didn't try hard enough.

                    SWANN
          I can't... I can't go any
          further...

     Harry nods, and gently detaches his arm from Swann's panicked
     grip.  He crosses to the door. 

     Suddenly. Butterfield reaches out of the darkness, and
     catches hold of Harry's leg. throwing him to the ground. 

     He has one of the INSTRUMENTS in his hand.  He STABS at
     Harry, striking the ground between Harry's legs.

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

                    NIX
          Here is my wisdom.

     He stamps on the ground.  CRACKS spread from his foot in all
     directions. ON THE CULTISTS, amazed by this manifestation of
     power.

                    BARBARA
          Show us. Puritan.

                    NORMAN
          Yes, show us!

                    ALL
          Show us!  Show us!

     With a ROAR, a PIT four or five feet across opens up beneath
     Nix and Dorothea.  Nix HOVERS over it.  It's utterly dark;
     perhaps bottomless. 

     Dorothea SCREAMS!

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM- - NIGHT

     Hearing Dorothea's CRY, Harry looks back towards the
     passageway.  Butterfield pulls the instrument out of the
     ground and stabs at Harry a second time.  But Swann catches
     hold of his arm.

                    SWANN
               (to Harry)
          Whatever he's doing to her, stop
          him!

     And Harry's up and away --

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

     -- he dashes over the glass --

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

     On Nix, Dorothea clasped close to him.  He REVOLVES as he
     floats over the chasm below then.

                    NIX
               (to unseen Cultists)
          You see, I escaped the grave. So I
          have to give something to the grave
          in return.

     On the Cultists, listening to their lord with love in their
     eyes. 

     A SLIT OPENS in the middle of Nix's forehead, above the
     bridge of his nose (this is an image we saw in the prints in
     the library), and from it comes a WAVE OF DARKNESS.  As Nix
     REVOLVES, the darkness STRIKES the GROUND around the
     Cultists.

     At first they don't realize what's going on.  They think this
     is some kind of bizarre blessing. 

     Then the ground starts to LIQUIFY beneath them.

                    NORMAN
          What's happening?

                    NIX
          I have to give something back. So
          I'm giving you.

     They're starting to SCREAM now as they sink into the ground. 
     They struggle, of course, but the earth seems to be hungry
     for them.  They are dragged down, THRASHING as they SINK.

                    BARBARA
               (sobbing)
          Why?  Why?

                    NIX
          You're not worthy.  None of you. 
          Only Swann was worthy. You just
          waited like lambs.

     Harry appears in the doorway.  Nix, still swinging round, has
     his back to Harry.

                    NIX
          Well I'm not your shepherd.

     Harry surveys the horrific scene in front of him.  The ground
     is now re-solidifying around the Cultists, some of whom have
     disappeared from view completely, some of whom still reach up
     out of the dirt.  The scene has a surreal beauty to it
     despite its horror.  SCREAMING FACES locked in the solid
     ground.  TWITCHING HANDS the same. Harry starts towards Nix
     and Dorothea, GUN levelled.  So far, he has avoided Nix's
     gaze.

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT

     Butterfield and Swann are locked in a life-or-death struggle. 
     They tumble back against the table upon which Nix was
     resurrected.  It collapses under them, and for a moment Swann
     is stunned.  Butterfield snatches up one of the instruments
     and STABS at Swann, who rolls out of the way in the nick of
     time. 

     The BLADE catches him in the arm, however.

                    SWANN
          Aah!

                    BUTTERFIELD
          Go on, bleed.
               (he slashes at Swann
          again)
          Go on!  Go on!

     Butterfield comes after him, and Swann backs off against a
     wall.  He SPITS out a serpentine FLAME, which races across
     the floor and leaps at Butterfield's face!

                    BUTTERFIELD
               (screaming)
          No!

     He falls backwards, his face ON FIRE.  Swann doesn't wait to
     watch him die, but races out into the passageway, BLOOD
     running from his wound.

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

     Harry is staring up at Dorothea as he very gingerly crosses
     the still-sticky ground.  He's a yard from the edge of the
     pit now. 

     Nix swings round.

                    NIX
          You're not Swann.  Who are you?
               (a beat) )
          Oh... I know what you want. He lets
          Dorothea slip from his arms.  

     Harry flings himself towards the hole and CATCHES HOLD of
     Dorothea's arm before she falls away into the abyss.  His GUN
     goes spinning across the ground, back towards the door
     leading to the passageway.

                    DOROTHEA
          Oh God!

                    HARRY
          Hang on!

     Nix reaches down to torment Harry.  But before he can make
     contact

                    SWANN (V.O.)
          Nix!

     Nix looks up.

                    NIX
          There you are. 

     Suddenly, Nix isn't interested in Harry and Dorothea. He
     steps onto solid ground, and walks towards Swann, his tone
     suddenly conversational.

                    NIX
          I've had a lot of time to think
          about you.  Where I went wrong...

     With Nix's back turned, Harry pulls Dorothea back out of the
     chasm.

                    SWANN
          And?

                    NIX
          I should have been honest with you,
          right from the start.  I wasn't
          born to show people the error of
          their ways.  I was born to murder
          the world.

     ON HARRY, as he leads Dorothea to the door.  Harry glances
     back into the room.

                    NIX
          You could still help me do that.

                    SWANN
          Why would I want to?

                    NIX
          Because you've got nothing else to
          live for.

                    SWANN
          Not true.

                    NIX
          The woman has a new love in her
          life.  Your friends are dead.
          Nobody's left to save you, but me

     He lays his hands on Swann.  Draws him into an embrace.

     ON HARRY and Dorothea.

                    HARRY
               (to Dorothea)
          I've got to help him.

                    DOROTHEA
          You can't.

                    HARRY
          Nix has got to have a weak spot. 
          Everybody's got a fucking weak
          spot.

     A NOISE. He turns, and suddenly --

     Butterfield is there!  His face is horribly burned, but he's
     still very much alive.

                    BUTTERFIELD
          Bastard!

     He launches himself at Harry, driving them both back into the
     BROKEN GLASS.  A FIGHT ensues, carrying them out into the
     Passageway. 

     Nix has Swann in a bear-hug.

                    NIX
          Will you help me? 

     A beat.  Then Swann nods.

                    SWANN
          Yes.

     Nix lets him go.

                    NIX
          You know I'll kill you when we're
          done.  I have to.

                    SWANN
          Yes.

                    NIX
          But until then... it's you and
          me... the way it always was.

                    SWANN
          Yes.

     Dorothea, at the doorway, watches this bizarre exchange.
     Swann's eyes flicker towards her.  Nix turns.

                    NIX
          Wait... you still feel something
          for that bitch?

                    SWANN
          No!

                    NIX
          Liar!

     Nix makes a gesture, and Swann is flung against the wall,
     pinned there like a fly, legs off the ground.

                    NIX
          Will!  You!  Never!  Learn!?

     With each word, Nix almost casually throws a gesture in
     Swann's direction, and though there is six feet between them,
     they have the force of terrible blows.  One to the ribs. 
     They CRACK.  One to the face.  It BLEEDS.  One to the legs,
     one to the arms.  They all BREAK.  Then Nix turns towards
     Dorothea.

                    NIX
          She's just flesh, Swannnie-boy.
          I'll show you!

     He moves towards Dorothea.  Swann falls to the ground,
     broken.

                    SWANN
          Harry!

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

     The fight between Butterfield and Harry continues.

                    SWANN (V.O.)
          Harry!  Stop him!

     Harry looks up.  Sees Dorothea retreating from the door, and
     running off into the darkness. 

     Butterfield comes at Harry again.  Harry's got no more time
     for this creep.  He delivers Butterfield a backhand swipe,
     and Butterfield lands face down in the glass.  We don't see
     the impact.  HEARING it's enough. 

     Harry looks down at the body.  Then --

                    NIX (V.O.)
          Where is she? 

     Harry turns.

     Nix is on him like a luoaernaut. treading on Butterfield's
     body as he comes at Harry!

                    NIX
          Where did she go?

     Nix GRABS hold of Harry's head with one hand and PRESSES the
     fingers of -the other hand against Harry's TEMPLES. He
     struggles to get free, but Nix is simply too powerful.

     Nix's fingers slowly SLIDE BENEATH the skin of Harry's
     temples.  As before, there's no blood.

                    NIX
          You've got Swann's disease. You
          think a little courage, a little
          love, and it'll all be all right. 
          Wrong!

     His fingers slide all the way in!

                    HARRY
          Oh God!

     Harry wrests himself free of Nix, and stumbles away. His eyes
     are BLOOD-RED.  Nix is a few yards behind him.

                    NIX
          Tell me where she is... and I'll
          make it go away...

     Harry is reeling around in the grip of a nightmare.

     HARRY'S P.O.V.

     The apocalyptic images on the walls seem to move!  A face
     SCREAMS!  FIRE blossoms! 

     ON HARRY, verging on insanity.

                    HARRY
          Oh God... oh God...

     HARRY'S P.O.V.

     Harry sees a WOMAN, wrapped in the sickly-sensual embrace of
     some glistening, barely visible OBSCENITY.  We can't see her
     face.  Only her mouth is visible in the coils of her
     devourer.

     ON HARRY

     as he approaches the wall, on which this woman is painted. 
     Reaching out for the image.

     HARRY'S P.O.V.

     The Woman reaches for Harry.

                    WOMAN           
          Help me.

     ON HARRY

     as he touches the wall.

                    HARRY
          Dorothea!

     He starts to SCRATCH out the plaster on which the image is
     painted.

                    HARRY
          Dorothea!  Dorothea!

     HARRY'S P.O.V.

     Darkness swallows the image of the woman.  She is still
     screaming when she disappears.

     ON SWANN, dragging his broken body to the door.

     ON HARRY 

     literally beating his head against the wall!

                    HARRY
          No!  No!  No!

                    DOROTHEA (V.O.)
          Harry...

     Harry stops.  Dare he believe this is truly her voice?

                    DOROTHEA
          It's not real, Harry-

     Harry turns around.  Dorothea is there.

     HARRY'S P.O.V.

     For a moment, he sees Dorothea as she is.

     ON HARRY, relief flooding his face.  Then --

     HARRY'S P.O.V.

     -- the image MORPHS.  Dorothea's beauty is replaced by
     primeval muck. 

     ON HARRY, appalled.  Dorothea grabs hold of him.

                    DOROTHEA
          Harry.  Listen to me. Whatever's
          good between us, believe it.

     Harry's face is deathly white, and pouring SWEAT.  He's
     fighting the delirium.  Or doing his best.


                    HARRY
          ... oh... God...

                    DOROTHEA
          I'm here, Harry.

                    HARRY
          ...yes?

                    DOROTHEA
          Yes.

     Nix steps from the shadows of the doorway behind Harry.

                    NIX
               (to Dorothea)
          There you are, child. 

     Harry starts to look round.

                    DOROTHEA
          Don't look.

                    HARRY
          I... have... to.

                    NIX
          Come on, child.  I want Swann to
          see you die. 

     Harry turns and looks at Nix.

     HARRY'S P.O.V.

     Nix's face darkens as it MORPHS.  And the flesh in the middle
     of his brow UNFOLDS, revealing a dark, pulsating THIRD EYE.

                    NIX
               (to Harry)
          What are you looking at?

     ON DOROTHEA, who has gone to the door of the Meditation Room
     and now slips inside. 

     ON HARRY, staring up at Nix.

     ON DOROTHEA, re-emerging from the Meditation Room.  In her
     hand, Harry's GUN.  Harry looks round at her.

                    HARRY
               (points to his brow)
          There... there!

     ON NIX, as he looks up at Dorothea. 

     ON DOROTHEA, as she raises the GUN.  She FIRES. 

     The bullet STRIKES Nix's FOREHEAD.  He sinks to his knees,
     BLOOD pouring down his face from the hole where his third EYE
     used to be.

     ON HARRY, as Nix's mind-hold falters.  He leans against the
     wall, shaking.

                    DOROTHEA
          Harry?

                    HARRY
          I'm okay.  I'm okay.

     Harry opens his eyes.  Looks up at her.

     HARRY'S P.O.V.

     The last of the MORPHING fades.  He sees Dorothea as she
     actually is.  Dorothea goes down to comfort him, and they
     embrace. 

     Suddenly, a ROAR from Nix.  They look towards him --

     -- it isn't over. 

     One last, terrifying transformation is overtaking Nix as he
     kneels in the GLASS.  His sallow flesh is running in STREAMS
     up his body towards the DARK HOLE in the middle of his
     forehead --

                    NIX
          One... last... illusion...

     -- his humanity is disappearing, vanishing into the vortex of
     the bullet wound.

                    DOROTHEA
          Oh my God.

     Harry and Dorothea start to get up... 

     Nix is no longer human.  He is a shape of gleaming DARKNESS,
     stripped of features.  He opens his mouth, the only visible
     element on his body is his toothed maw, which looses an
     utterly inhuman SHRIEK!

                    SWANN (V.O.)
          ... D'Amour...

     Harry glances through the door into the Meditation Room.
     Swann is on the threshold. 

     Nix RISES now.  He is a terrifying spectacle, his bulk
     somehow more intimidating than ever in this simplified form. 

     He comes at Dorothea, who has no choice but to back away into
     the Meditation Room.

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

     The pit still yawns in the middle of the floor. Dorothea is
     backed towards it by Nix. 

     When Nix SPEAKS, his voice is not remotely human.  It is
     DEMONIACAL.

                    NIX
          I am the purest of the pure.  I am
          the darkest of the dark...

     Harry is at the door now, starting towards Nix.

                    SWANN
          Harry.  You can't kill him. 

     Harry crouches beside Swann.

                    HARRY
               (whispers)
          He did something with the ground.

                    SWANN
          Yes?

                    HARRY
          Can you do it?

                    SWANN
          I don't know.

                    HARRY
          Try.

     ON DOROTHEA.  She's a couple of yards from the pit now.

                    NIX (V.O.)
          I'm beyond Heaven.  I'm beyond
          Hell.

     Suddenly, Harry lunges at Nix, grabbing hold of his legs. 
     Nix topples.

     ON SWANN, who puts his hands on the ground.  Closes his eyes. 

     A wave of LIQUIFICATION runs through the ground from Swann's
     broken fingers -- 

     -- the Cultists' bodies MOVE in the softening ground, like
     corpses in surf, and ROLL towards the pit, their dead faces
     resurfacing --

     Barbara's body floats past Nix, and disappears over       
     the edge of the pit.

                    HARRY
               (to Dorothea)
          Get out of here!

     The ground is very liquid now, and the corpses are lodging
     around Nix as they're all carried towards the pit.  So's
     Harry, of course. 

     Nix tries to get up, but he's too late.  The corpses weigh
     him down, the ground is too fluid for him to get a proper
     hold, and Harry still clings to his legs.

                    NIX
          No!  No!  No!

     He's at the edge of the pit.

                    DOROTHEA (V.O.)
          Harry!

     Harry looks round.  Dorothea's behind him, risking the
     flowing ground to offer him a hand. 

     Nix starts to fall into the pit.  At the last minute, he
     reaches for Harry, as -- 

     -- Harry is pulled out of reach bv Dorothea. 

     Together they stumble to THE DOOR, where Swann still lies. 
     They look back to see 

     NIX, as he goes over the edge of the pit and FALLS SCREAMING. 

     At the door, Dorothea lifts up Swann's head.  He's dead. She
     closes his eyes.

                    CUT TO:

     INT. THE PIT

     What we are about to witness is the longest fall-to-his-
     death by any villain in the history of cinema... 

     Nix is falling through rock.  Still SCREAMING.  He CRASHES
     against a layer of stone, which his body smashes to
     smithereens.  And as he falls --

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

                    DOROTHEA
          Is it finished?

                    HARRY
          I think so.

     No it's not.  Nix keeps falling, breaking through another
     layer of rock as he descends deeper and deeper into the
     earth. 

     And now... there's a hint of FIERY LIGHT below.  He's
     approaching MAGMA.

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

                    DOROTHEA
          Come on...

     She puts her arms around him.  Kisses him, sobbing with
     relief.

     INT. THE PIT

     Nix hits a layer of molten rock, and, SCREAMING, he
     disappears.  A BURST of dark, roiling ENERGY erupts from the
     spot where he sank, and starts up the pit --

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

     The room TREMBLES.  There's a ROAR in the earth.

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

                    HARRY
          What the fuck? 

                    DOROTHEA
          Harry-?

                    HARRY
          Out!  Out! 

     They race for the front door --

     INT. THE PIT

     -- the wave of ENERGY, like a howling, dark WIND, ascends at
     a breath-taking rate

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

     Harry and Dorothea race for the open air, as

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

     The ENERGY ERUPTS from the pit.

     EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

     Harry and Dorothea stumble out, into the night --

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

     The ENERGY howls from room to room, ERODING the images off
     the walls, BLOWING out the doors, DESTROYING all the
     resurrection equipment in the Sanctum --

     EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - DESERT - DAWN

     Harry and Dorothea stumble to the car.  They look back at the
     house, as the cacophony of destruction dies down. 

     ON THE RIM OF THE SUN, as it peeps over the desert horizon.

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - VARIOUS - DAWN

     The SUNLIGHT creeps through the rooms as the DUST settles.

     INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - DAWN

     The hole in the floor CLOSES UP, and is SEALED... SILENCE
     reigns.

     EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - DESERT - DAWN

     Harry and Dorothea get into the car.  Harry glances back at
     the house.  Nothing.

                    HARRY
               (quietly)
          It's finished.

     EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - IDOLS - DAWN

     ON THE IDOLS and the FRONT DOOR, virtually destroyed by tine.

     WE DRIFT THROUGH THEM, INTERCUTTING WITH:

     EXT. HARRY'S CAR - DESERT ROAD - DAWN                  

     Harry's car speeds away, leaving a plume of dust as

     THE CREDITS ROLL
