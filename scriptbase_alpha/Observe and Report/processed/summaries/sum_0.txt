Ronnie Barnhardt lives with his alcoholic mother.
He's chief security guard at Forest Ridge Mall, where he's in love with Brandi, a cosmetic sales clerk, and gets a free coffee each day from Nell, a cheery clerk in the food court.
A flasher haunts the mall's parking lot, and at night, thefts occur.
Ronnie is intent on catching the criminals but has no investigative skills, is delusional about his abilities, and makes mad accusations.
His bête noire is Detective Harrison, the city cop sent to investigate.
Ronnie thinks he could be an officer, thinks he stands a chance with Brandi, and slowly loses his self control.
Will reality set in?
What about redemption?
