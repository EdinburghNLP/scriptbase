<b>                          JENNIFER EIGHT
</b>

                            Written by

                          Bruce Robinson






                                                  June 1991




<b>     1:  INT.  COMMUNITY HALL.   DAY.
</b>
     The Church of St. Peter Los Angeles. "WHOEVER YOU SEE HERE -
     WHATEVER YOU HEAR HERE - STAYS HERE." That's a notice on a
     wall. Here's another notice "NO SMOKING." Everyone is smok-
     ing. This is an AA meeting. There's a lot of Faces to look
     at. I don't know when we'll get to the one that's talking,
     but when we do it's like this. Eyes like glue. 50 years old
     with a face the color of a snuff-users hanky. He says this:

<b>                                 BENNY
</b>                 .. after my third recovery my wife made
                 me swear I'd never bring another bottle
                 into the house.  And I never did. I bur-
                 ied it under the lawn.  Cut out a turf &amp;
                 stood it upright with a piece of tin-
                 foil instead of a cork. So here we are
                 out in the yard, and she's happy because
                 I'm getting healthy in a pair of swim-
                 ing shorts &amp; no way near no booze. She
                 decides to prune the roses. Meanwhile,
                 I'm laying there with a straw stuck in-
                 to the fucken lawn doing a quart of red ..

     Curious thing about drunks. Their disease often amuses them.

                 That's how crazy I was - I was sick for
                 half a life till I finally found my san-
                 ity again in these rooms. Don't take that
                 drink - And for the one or two new faces
                 I see here, I say this: just do it by the
                 day. You gotta do it by the day - Don't
                 take that drink. And keep coming to these
                 meetings. Because here is where it works ..

<b>                                 CHAIR
</b>                 Thank you, Benny .. We have a few more
                 minutes .. Anyone else like to share? ..

     Ash into an ashtray and now a face. He's around 40 years old.
     Intense eyes &amp; dark hair. Probably good looking when the ang-
     le's right. But this is a bad angle. His name is JOHN BERLIN.

<b>                                 BERLIN
</b>                 My name's John .. and I'm an alcoholic ..

<b>                                 ALL
</b>                 Hi, John.

<b>                                 BERLIN
</b>                 I didn't intend to speak today.  Matter of
                 fact, I wasn't gonna come to the meeting ..
                 But I wanna say a couple of things I hope
                 may be of use, particularly as Benny says,
                 to the new faces here. I first came into
                 this fellowship ten months ago. I came to
                 a meeting I was convinced was gonna be my
                 last - how could a buncha drunks help me? -
                 Then someone got up, I think it was Micky,
                 and described himself as "the shit around
                 which the universe revolved." I don't know
                 if that was original to him - it doesn't
                 matter, it was the first time I'd heard it,
                 and I still can't think of a better way to
                 describe how I felt - We all have our own
                 place in the darkness, and I was in such a
                 mess I could hardly fucken see - I'd lost
                 someone very dear to me - she hadn't died -
                 I had - I don't know whether she left coza
                 the drinking, or whether I drank coz I knew
                 she was gonna leave - either way, the booze
                 won - I replaced her with alcohol &amp; anger -
                 I was angry with her, myself, everyone and
                 everything - Where I was I wanted to be
                 someplace else - any place but here - any
                 moment but now - But here I am, and it is
                 now, and there's a big change about to hap-
                 pen in my life - and I'm going for it coz
                 this time I know I'm not running away - I'm
                 actually two miles into a 600 mile journey,
                 and I feel good about myself going there -
                 So I stopped off to share that with you -
                 and to thank everyone of you, and everyone
                 in this fellowship for letting me walk out
                 of here, free ..

<b>     2:  EXT.  OAKLAND BRIDGE.  SAN FRANCISCO BAY.  DUSK.
</b>
     High above the Golden Gate. Too high for specifics. But there
     is something down there of interest to the Camera. Descending
     with the Music it seems to isolate a particular car. Too many
     and too distant to know which it is. But the Camera is follow-
     ing and already a mile up the 101 Interstate travelling north.

     Maybe via a dissolve. And maybe not. But red and white either
     way as the headlights are coming on. The Camera is closing on
     the highway. And a car has definitely been selected. There is
     nothing much of interest about it. It's a blue Mercedes sedan.

     Mussorgsky will choreograph the pace of these cuts. The first
     puts the frame directly in front of the car. In a few moments
     its brights snap up. And Titles continue in a dazzle of light.

<b>     3:  INT.  MERCEDES SEDAN.  101.  DUSK.
</b>
     Nobody in the car except BERLIN. And a lot of cigarette smoke.
     Just time to wedge in a P.O.V. There's an intersection coming
     up. He hits the indicators and crosses lanes winding his wind-
     ow down. Takes a last hit at his cigarette and exits the butt.

<b>     4:  EXT.  FREEWAY INTERSECTION.  DUSK.
</b>
     An instant of red as the cigarette shatters up the highway. A
     heavy sky of red and black cloud. The Mercedes turns off head-
     ing east. This time the Camera doesn't follow. Remains static
     over the intersection until the tail lights finally disappear.

<b>     5:  INT.  LIVING ROOM.  HOUSE.  DAWN.
</b>
     Bare wooden boards and the sound of singing birds. This house
     hasn't been lived in for years. No furniture other than a new
     mattress in the middle of the floor. Still in polythene wraps.

     BERLIN just about awake on top of it. Ten seconds of disorien-
     tation while he puts this together. A stone fireplace. Stairs
     leading to what's got to be a tiny room above. With enough ef-
     fort this place could be charming. But right now it's a wreck.

<b>     6:  INT.  KITCHEN.  HOUSE.  DAWN.
</b>
     This kitchen was out of date by 1963. A huge china sink and a
     fat fridge. But the cooker works and a battered old kettle is
     already on the gas. T-shirt and instant coffee. BERLIN checks
     cupboards out. Crockery includes a cup and that'll do for now.

     His lips articulate a silent expletive. The gas has just gone
     out. Tries to relight it without success. On hands &amp; knees he
     explores a rubber supply pipe that snakes under the back door.

<b>     7:  EXT.  OPEN END GARAGE AND YARD.  HOUSE.  DAWN.
</b>
     In the garage he finds the gas cylinder.  Empty and so is the
     bastard with it. He drags fingers through hair in frustration.
     Looks around at the heaps of crap that need clearing out. The
     view beyond he hardly cares to look at.  But if he does it is
     as follows.  Clouds massing on the horizon. Fields getting re-
     ady for rain.  His nearest neighbor is around 200 yards away.
     His nearest Cow about 50. This house is remote and rural look-
     ing with a veranda out back. But BERLIN has no inclination for
     sight-seeing. As he walks away a dreary female Voice seeps in.

<b>     8:  INT.  LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN.  HOUSE.  DAWN.
</b>
     The Voice comes via a police scanner. Most of this dialogue's
     bullshit. Illegally parked autos and a few drunks still about.
     BERLIN sits on the mattress eating a breakfast of chewing gum
     and milk. He unwraps another Juicy Fruit and regrets it. Goes
     round his mouth like a shoe in a washing machine. A reluctant
     decision is taken. Spits gum at the sink as he arrives in the
     kitchen. Starts unloading his leather bag. A flotsam of stuff
     is excavated including a 9mm Beretta and a pack of cigarettes.

     He lights up and takes a cruel hit full of nicotine and guilt.
     Wouldn't need a clairvoyant to realize he's trying to give up.
     Something on the scanner interests him and he wanders back to
     the living room. There's a call going out for "David 72 Sam 3."
     David 72 acknowledges and BERLIN clearly recognizes the voice.

     "We have a 927D/ Springfield Street/ City Dump." But David 72
     is already hired. "I'm outside Emersons/ I wanna be the first
     horrible face of her day." BERLIN exhales through a smile. The
     Controller needs an E.T.A. for the 927? David 72 doesn't know.
     Advises her to roll a couple of cars and "Secure the location."

<b>     9:  EXT.  HILLSIDE.  SPRINGFIELD STREET.  EUREKA.  DAY.
</b>
     A Chevrolet zig-zags up a shabby canyon. It's the road to the
     city dump. Its final bend reveals a line of bellowing garbage
     trucks. Everything is backed up. Nothing moves except the car.
     The cause of the hold-up is explained at the top. A Sheriff's
     car blocks the road. A Uniform moves to wave the Chevrolet in.

<b>     10:  EXT.  ENTRANCE/TRACK/INFILL.  CITY DUMP.  EUREKA.  DAY.
</b>
     The car parks at a weigh-house and a man in his 50's gets out.
     Looks like he hasn't slept in a while. And got the mood to go
     with it. Sports jacket and cowboy boots. A lot of laugh lines
     around the eyes. But you wouldn't want to get arrested by him.
     And especially not this morning. His name is FREDERICK T ROSS.

<b>                                 TRAVIS
</b>                        You can drive down there, Sir ..

<b>                                 ROSS
</b>                        I'm already walking. Where is it?

     One of those walking with him is a 10-year-old Kid with a Dog.
     TRAVIS looks almost too young to own his struggling moustache.

<b>                                 TRAVIS
</b>                        On the infill. The guy from
                        L.A.'s just gone down there ..

<b>                                 ROSS
</b>                        He has? .. What's he doing here?

     A series of terraces have been created as the canyon fills up.
     Black smoke drifts from a distance at will of the wind. Gulls
     and bulldozers. Plus a stinking ten foot cliff of human filth.

     Several cars parked here including the blue Mercedes. Several
     On Lookers behind yellow police tape. ROSS negotiates it look-
     ing pissed off. Looks up and somewhere in the smoke is BERLIN.

                        knife. I can't find the knife.

     And the next thing ROSS is looking at is a death in the trash.
     A massive dozer in the background. Everything else is garbage.

     Another face here is so familiar ROSS hasn't bothered to ackn-

     Little is visible of the body except a blood-stained raincoat.

     BERLIN wears surgical gloves. Removes film from a small camera.

     Swatting smoke ROSS directs anger at a fat cop called VENABLES.

                        You, too .. Move that ass ..

     BERLIN hands the film to ROSS as he gets into identical gloves.

                        You done the pockets?

     ROSS has a Vic inhaler up his nostril. An inadequate defense.
     A sudden stink slams into his neck muscles. Head and inhaler
     travel rearward. He shifts eyes to BERLIN who scans the Bum's
     autopsy reports. A PATHOLOGIST comments on his handiwork into
     a microphone hanging from the ceiling. "Except as previously

     A newspaper featuring a small photograph and article on Berlin.
     Holding the Finger he carefully inserts a hypodermic needle un-

     "Notice anything weird about it?" The answer from ROSS is "No."

                        How come she's got so many scars?

     He walks out of the projection beam and neon light flutters on.

     Approximate date of birth/Approximate date of death/ Identity
     Unknown. Visible misgivings as he hauls it out and reads. One
     or two chairs already on desks. ROSS still at his pawing over

                        with a thumb nail, or something?

     But CITRINE isn't interested in finger nails. He's staring at
     a polystyrene torso of a faceless girl. She wears a brassiere
     stuffed with newspaper and a black wig. (Welcome Jennifer Two)

                        She's almost identical to Jennifer.

     A question he doesn't need because he hasn't an answer. CITRINE
     has an eye on further photographs relevant to the Jennifer case.

                        I don't know nothing about this "Jenn-

                        body. He wanted it found. So if this is
                        the same guy, why's he hidden this one?

     The lights change and off they go and BERLIN waits for a turn.

<b>                                 ROSS
</b>                        Why don't you dump it? Mail it off.

                        you feel about him. That's how you
                        feel about yourself. You won't give
                        yourself one-fucking-minute for you.

     And by now they've arrived and pulled up on the garage forecourt.
     It's indicative of their friendship that ROSS can talk like this.

                        Wait for me. It might not be ready.

     He quits the car and BERLIN watches him scurry towards a service
     shop. Rain beats on the roof and BERLIN looks stubbed out. A lot
     of cuts coming up and here are some of them. Runs a hand through
     his hair in unconscious frustration. A finger constantly bothers
     the Zippo. Eyes towards ROSS who silhouettes in florescent light.

     Somewhere in the background the lights change to red. Once again
     the beeping sound of traffic-lights speaking to the blind. Maybe
     he looks across but that doesn't matter. Something just happens
     inside his head he isn't yet quite aware of. Everything in close
     up. Big on the Zippo. Big on BERLIN. And he leaps out of the car.

     BERLIN sprints through the weather.  A station wagon is still in
     the air at the end of an hydraulic jack. Surprise from ROSS and a
     MECHANIC as BERLIN arrives. Fuck the fanbelt and listen to this.

<b>                                 BERLIN

                        and redecorate your entire house ..

     Rain beats at the roof and the jack sinks the wagon behind them.

                        She's blind, Ross - that's why all
                        the scars - hear that traffic light?
                        That noise is to help blind people -
                        that's why the marks on her finger-
                        tips? - this lady reads in Braille ..

<b>     27:  INT.  ADMINISTRATION.  POLICE STATION.  DAY.
</b>
     BERLIN sits at a desk at the end of the room. Nothing here but
     a legal pad and a phone. The pad is covered in names &amp; numbers.
     Right now he's into a call and this is sounding promising."How
     old?" And he writes 26. "How long?" About 6 weeks ago. Hope in
     his eyes as he looks across to a woman called ANN. She's doing
     what he's doing on a different line "Wait a minute, I specific-
     ally said I was looking for a girl?" And all hope over because
     Lesley is a boy. But here comes ANN &amp; this might be something?

     Sticks a sheet of notes on his desk and he junks the last call.

                                 BERLIN (New call)

     ROSS in transit grinning from ear to ear. BERLIN interested in
     little but his notes and ROSS in nothing but obvious good news.

<b>     28:  EXT.  LANDSCAPE/ROAD.  TRINITY FOREST.  DAY.
</b>
     Mussorgsky is back on a shock cut. Big music and a shattering
     landscape. Juniper woods and mountains. Sunlight on fresh fal-
     len snow. Somewhere a long way off a car crawls up the valley.

     Ross's car bursts into frame and as quickly the bend snatches
     it away. An unexpected building in the distance. Victorian at
     a glance but probably later. A clock tower and fifty lifeless
     windows. The Chevy disappears towards its somber architecture.

<b>     29:  EXT.  THE SHASTA-TRINITY INSTITUTE.  DAY.
</b>
     Pine trees and slush and parked cars. The Chevrolet swings in
     and parks in front of the mansion. Breath in the air and eyes
     on the ugly pile as they slam doors and head for its entrance.

<b>     30:  INT.  ENTRANCE/RECEPTION.  INSTITUTE.  DAY.

     BERLIN first with ROSS following. As soon as they hit the ent-
     rance they trigger a recorded voice. "YOU ARE NOW AT THE MAIN
     ENTRANCE. THERE ARE SIX STEPS." Midway up them with ROSS look-
     ing back. "RECEPTION IS THROUGH SWING DOORS AND TO YOUR RIGHT."

<b>     31:  INT.  PRINCIPAL'S OFFICER.  INSTITUTE.  DAY.

     GOODRIDGE is mid-50's with a beard like Abraham Lincoln. Sits
     far side of his desk alternating eyes between ROSS and BERLIN.
     The latter studies a photograph of a Girl in a file. It's pos-
     sible they've found Jennifer Two? "How recent is the picture?"

<b>                                 GOODRIDGE
</b>                        Then you could have saved yourself
                        a lot of driving, Sergeant. What I
                        said on the phone's the same as I'm

     He doesn't like them but not as much as ROSS doesn't like him.

<b>                                 ROSS
</b>                        A blind girl can just walk out of

</b>                        Then let me put your mind at ease ..
                        Firstly, Amber isn't "blind" - she
                        has some useful vision - and second,
                        this isn't a prison, it's a college
                        of higher education - a severe vis-
                        ual disability doesn't mean my stud-
                        ents don't value their independence
                        as much as anybody else - and Amber
                        was a very independent young woman -
                        She decided to leave - so she left ..

<b>                                 ROSS
</b>                        And you got no idea with who?

<b>                                 GOODRIDGE
</b>                        No, Sergeant, I got no idea with who.
                        And I might add, that in another six
                        weeks, a hundred and fifty students
                        will be leaving here, &amp; driving away
                        for their Christmas holidays with pe-
                        ople whose name I-won't-know-either ..

     ROSS could sock him in the crop but the phone rings and he ex-
     cuses himself to answer it. Whatever he hears he isn't liking.

                        You have an appointment with Miss
                        Robertson?

<b>                                 BERLIN

<b>                                 GOODRIDGE
</b>                        As she's a member of my staff,
                        may I ask what this is about?

<b>                                 BERLIN
</b>                        Well, apparently, she saw Amber the
                        weekend she left, &amp; was briefly in
                        the room with the guy she left with.

<b>                                 GOODRIDGE
</b>                        I see .. Well, she's teaching an-

<b>     32:  INT.  CORRIDOR.  INSTITUTE.  DAY.
</b>
     Looking back down a deserted corridor. Someone tried to put sun-
     shine on the walls with yellow paint. Somewhere a long way away
     there is a sound like children singing. ROSS loathes this joint.
     Loathes its silence. Eyes back to BERLIN as he rings a doorbell.

<b>                                 ROSS
</b>                        Where is everyone?

<b>                                 BERLIN
</b>                        I dunno .. I guess this is
                        staff side of the building?

     Here come footsteps and the door is opened by HELENA ROBERTSON.
     Early 20's and blonde and not immediately beautiful. But delic-
     ate features than need no make up and big dark eyes. They look
     away for introductions as though she's shy. ROSS &amp; BERLIN grab
     glances as they follow in. Neither expected HELENA to be blind.

<b>     33:  INT.  APARTMENT.  INSTITUTE.  DAY.
</b>
     Claustrophobia evaporates instantly. Great views down the val-
     ley from every window. Plus a bizarre jumble of furniture and
     colors. But no pictures on the walls. No friendly photographs.
     Nor any lights. Although the afternoon is shutting down there
     isn't a light in the room. ROSS elects to stay at the windows.
     BERLIN takes an offered chair. HELENA sits nervously opposite.

<b>                                 HELENA

                        here. And Mr Ross is maybe gonna
                        take a few notes, if that's O.K.?
                             (She nods)

                        in what ever way you want, what

                        phone .. I went up to her room
                        to say good-bye, and we just sat
                        on the bed and chatted a while,
                        while her friend was coming in
                        and out collecting her things ..

     Lots of headshake. And lots of silences. "I really don't know."

                        That's O.K. Can you give me any
                        idea what this fellow was like?

     Possibly the only grin ROSS is going to get out of this place.

     A good point. And a point taken. And BERLIN might even say so.

                        We don't have some kind of
                        sixth-sense, you know. Ex-

     Now another silence overtaken by a low whistle in another room.

                        He used a breath freshener ...

     A sardonic headshake from ROSS. Well that solves the case then!

                        And I think his name was John?

                        ing tea. Would you like some?

     BERLIN would but ROSS wouldn't. She leaves and whispers begin.

                        Someone must have seen something?

     Negative from BERLIN. Checked it out. Sunday and no one about.

                        This is fucken crazy. Two hours
                        here, two hours back, and the
                        only word I've written is John ..

     A touch later and the sun is setting. ROSS stands at a window
     to watch it go. Watches one or two cars driving away. Watches
     a bird sitting outside on the fire-escape. BERLIN's voice can
     just about be heard off screen "You said he spoke? Can you re-
     member what he said?" ROSS saunters back into HELENA's answer.

<b>                                 HELENA

                        hurry up, will you, because
                        it's starting to snow again.

     Empty teacups and empty notebook. ROSS sits opposite BERLIN.

                        And I remember, he was a lit-
                        tle breathless from carrying
                        the cases because the elevat-
                        or had gone out that weekend.

</b>                        No, it has a mind of its own.

     A clock strikes four somewhere. And BERLIN knows he's lost it.

<b>                                 BERLIN
</b>                        Can I see your hands?

</b>                        My hands?

     He takes her hands and HELENA immediately looks uncomfortable.
     He examines scars and she stares at him with her useless eyes.

                        I have a class.  I have to go.

<b>                                 BERLIN

                        tell me? Anything about him or
                        her? Doesn't matter how small?

<b>                                 HELENA
</b>                        No. Except he smoked. Like you.

                        breath, like I can on your's.

     A taut instant between ROSS and BERLIN. BERLIN caught out and
     he knows it. ROSS roars in silence "YOU LYING PIG" and writes
     in his notebook. The angle switches to see "BERLIN IS A LIAR."

                        I'm late .. I really have to go ..

     Everyone suddenly on their feet and HELENA gets into a jacket.

                        this memo here, Sergeant?

     He tries to get his notebook under BERLIN's nose.  But BERLIN
     isn't looking or listening but following HELENA into her hall.

<b>                                 BERLIN

     She opens the door and ROSS is barely through before it slams.

<b>     34:  INT.  CORRIDOR.  INSTITUTE.  DAY.
</b>
     ROSS baits BERLIN up the corridor. Ridicules in silence while
     counting imaginary winnings. Watch my lips! F.I.F.T.Y. HELENA
     walks innocent of the pantomime and BERLIN tries to ignore it.

<b>                                 BERLIN

                        thing at all, you let me know, O.K.

     He bells the elevator refusing to acknowledge ROSS's bullshit.

                        I'll leave a number with the office ..

     Lips drill a whisper into his ear. "Fifty fucken dollars, O.K."

                        What exactly do you teach, Helena?

     Meanwhile the elevator arrives triggering a Voice. "YOU ARE NOW
     ON THE FOURTH FLOOR." Doors slide open and Christ look at this?
     What kind of eye-defect needs glasses like this? Lenses like ei-
     ther half of a glass ball.  He's early 30's and decidedly "iffy."
     Is he student/staff or what? As he exits they enter staring aft-
     er him. As the doors close the MYOPIC turns to stare after them.

<b>     35:  INT.  CHEVROLET.  TRINITY VALLEY.  DUSK.

     Gloom congeals around flashlights. A winter mist falling down.
     TRIMBLE and Doberman watch as BERLIN goes at it with a shovel.
     A dozen graves already dug and he's halfway into another. Des-
     pite the cold he sweats in shirt sleeves. Also breathless and
     rests to catch his wind. "Don't you have to go to bed?" No he
     doesn't. He wants to see the victim. Digging recommences with
     TRIMBLE supplying the light. BERLIN suddenly stops. "Get that
     lamp down here." White lime. Black fur. They've found the Dog.

     BERLIN begins an examination holding a tiny flashlight in his
     teeth. Eyes excitedly back to TRIMBLE and gesturing towards a
     bag. "That bag there. You find a knife and a paira long-nosed
     pliers." TRIMBLE does it relishing the snap of a switch-blade.

     BERLIN still busy with the light in his mouth. TRIMBLE pissed
     because he can't see what's happening. BERLIN removes a crump-
     led bullet from the back of the Labrador's skull. Holds it up
     for scrutiny. Small calibre. Badly distorted. "Looks like a 22?"

     fast as its mechanics are capable. Details coming in from San
     Diego. VICAP Case Number/F.B.I. Case Number/Victim Status/etc
     etc. Letters smacking into paper too fast to read. But one de-
     tail is repeated constantly and underlined. "Identity Unknown."

     Transmission ends and BERLIN hauls at least a yard of homicide
     out of the machine. Can't believe what he's looking at. "Jesus.
     He hit six." Reads as he walks back into the big room and gets
     interrupted by a call. "Miss Robertson. Holding." He heads for

     ity presently evident in both. Engine roaring and ROSS is cov-

     And this is the second time they stop and stare at each other.

                        That old Wino on the heap wasn't
                        a suicide. He stumbled into some-

                        He was trying out a new pair of
                        skis in his hallway. The phone
                        rings, and he goes for it, and
                        falls off. He must be the only
                        skier in Northern California to
                        break a leg in his living room.

     But he doesn't really believe it. And doesn't enjoy saying no.

     The Mercedes and Music travel north. The latter made sinister
     by this landscape. Forest plunging into dark ravines. The sun
     colors the mountains red. But most of the valley is in shadow.

     A high wind in the chimneys. And the view is still from above.
     Like someone's looking down from the top of the building. And
     maybe someone is? BERLIN parks it and gets out. Stretches and
     walks towards the institute. He looks very small from up here.

     HELENA plays Elgar in an empty gymnasium. Sunlight streams in
     staining the air red. As BERLIN arrives doors on the opposite
     wall flap together like somebody just hurried out. Did he see
     someone? Perhaps not. The trees outside move a lot of shadows.

     Music stands. Vacant chairs. BERLIN takes one to watch her re-
     hearse. Realizes just how beautiful she is. And HELENA realiz-
     es someone is there. Before she can ask he identifies himself.

     But she's already fussing about stuffing sheet music in a bag.

                        Matter of fact, I saw a little
                        restaurant place down the road.
                        Looked kinda pretty? I thought
                        maybe we could have some lunch?

     No answer but the answer is no. BERLIN finds her book for her.

                        Alright, whatever .. Was some-
                        one in here with you? When I

                        some cars sound thin, and this
                        kind of car sounded "hollow" ..

     Any moment now they turn a corner of the stairs into close-up.

                        Maybe it was a foreign car?
                        Our kinda cars sound "fat."

     The elevator is parked on this floor with its doors half open.

                        Are you sure you wanna see it?
                        It's another three floors up?

     Despite breathlessness he does. "How often does it break down?"

                        Oh, all the time. They keep
                        threatening to have it re-

     at the door. "I sat right there, on the bed." The bed is gone
     but why tell her? He checks the wardrobe. Guess what? Hangers.

     His smile deteriorates as he realizes she's "staring" at him.

                        What are you staring at, Hel-

                        reminded me of him .. He was
                        standing right where you are,
                        kind of breathless, like you.

     Nothing happening except the wind. Then a smile as she leaves.

                        I'll get my coat, wait
                        for you downstairs ..

     And he begins an exploration. Musty bathroom with old-fashion-
     ed fixtures. A tap leaking behind shower curtains. Nothing in
     the cabinet. Nothing under the sink. Six steps and he is in a
     kitchen. Finally finds something worth looking for. Tears the
     sack out of a vacuum cleaner. Discovers a knot of hair from a
     black dog. Simultaneously the door slams. Shock powers him in-
     to the sitting room in time to hear a key turning in the lock.
     Hits the door and shouts. Hears footsteps moving rapidly away.

     Hellava wind that turns a key! But he says nothing. Takes the
     book while she gets into her coat. She's obviously made an ef-
     fort. A change of clothes and her hair pinned up. But she has
     got the sweater on inside out and the label is under her chin.

<b>                                 HELENA
</b>                        Coz I wanted to feel the snow
                        on my face .. I think that's
                        when I heard her call him John?

     Time to go and both know it. Stale shadows and growing silence.

                        Is it snowing now?

<b>                                 BERLIN
</b>                        No. Getting dark though.

     And his eyes are searching her so hard she must be aware of it.

                        You think you'd know this man? If
                        he was in the room with you again?

     The silence is almost uncomfortable. BERLIN continues to stare.

                        Amber's dead, isn't she?

<b>                                 BERLIN

<b>     50:  EXT.  SUBURBAN STREET.  CITY OF EUREKA.  DAY.
</b>
     Pretty houses in a pretty little street. Hills in the back and
     sunshine out front. BERLIN pulls up in his Mercedes and does a
     bit of tie adjusting as he walks up a path and hits the chimes.
     This could only be MRS CITRINE. A budget smile and he's inside.

<b>     51:  INT.  "STUDIO"/CONSERVATORY.  HOUSE.  DAY.
</b>
     Dozens of repulsive paintings.  A truly repulsive painting "By
     Numbers" of the Mona Lisa in progress. The color codes are com-
     pletely fucked up. CITRINE wears a wooly hat and hates walking
     on crutches. BERLIN picked a bad day to come in here with this.

<b>                                 CITRINE
</b>                        You're pushing this too hard. It's
                        like you want me to say stop? You
                        must know that's the way this is
                        going, John? There's other work to
                        do, why don't ya ease off a little?

</b>                        Then where's the body? .. Where's
                        the body, and why's he hidden it?

<b>                                 BERLIN
</b>                        He hasn't hidden it. He never made
                        a hit this far north before, and
                        he never read a weather forecast ..
                        She's probably fifteen feet from
                        the highway, three feet under snow.

                        Her dog's shot. And she's missing.

<b>                                 CITRINE
</b>                        She's not "missing." Did she shout?
                        Did she scream? Did he coerce her?
                        No. She left of her own free will ..
                        And if she gets on a plane and goes
                        to Peru with the prick, she's still
                        not missing. You got no case, John.

                        Chief, in this country, would put a

                        circumstances - a tailor's dummy
                        wearing a brassiere - and a bill
                        for seventeen dollars for its wig!

<b>     52:  INT.  CORRIDOR/ADMINISTRATION.  POLICE STATION.  DAY.
</b>
     BERLIN arrives at the station in the same mood he left Citrine.
     Heads for his room and runs into ROSS's stare. Problems on his
     plate too. He sits at his desk looking uncharacteristically an-
     xious. What ever he's drinking isn't tea. He finds a bottle of
     J&amp;B in a drawer and walks toward Berlin's freshly slammed door.

<b>     52:  INT.  CRIME LAB.  POLICE STATION.  DAY.
</b>
     The lab is stuffed with junk waiting his attention. (Dozens of
     common things made sinister by their labels and plastic sacks).
     ROSS delivers a dose of Scotch in a plastic cup. Pours himself
     another. Leans on a bench and gets into the pissed-off silence.

<b>                                 ROSS
</b>                        Did he shut you down?

                        the fucking mayor walks in - mad

</b>                        I wish he'd tell that to Citrine.

     He almost does the whiskey but reaches for chewing gum instead.

                        He thinks the kid shot the dog ..

     He looks at ROSS like what-are-you-looking-at-me-like-that-for?

                        He didn't.

<b>                                 ROSS

<b>                                 BERLIN

<b>                                 ROSS
</b>                        No, I think you'll find I looked like
                        he could have? By accident even? He's
                        up here spraying the scenery all day.

<b>                                 BERLIN
</b>                        He didn't shoot it, Ross. And
                        no way by accident. There's a
                        flash-burn. It was point-blank.

     SERATO walks in with a cigarette plugged into his ashen kisser.

<b>                                 SERATO

<b>                                 SERATO

<b>     54:  INT.  ANTI ROOM/INTERROGATION.  POLICE STATION.  DAY.
</b>
     This room and the interrogation room are linked with a one-way
     mirror. BERLIN looks through munching gum. EMERSON is 25 years
     old and many pounds of vexed flesh. But something about her ex-
     pression expects apology. SERATO paces the place chain-smoking.
     ROSS listens devastated as the EXPERT explains his lousy chart.

<b>                                 EXPERT
</b>                        This is the important one. She
                        gets a dead straight line, and
                        that's an exceptional reading ..

                        know she someway busted it.

<b>                                 EXPERT
</b>                        This is an honest girl. She
                        couldn't lie if she tried ..

<b>                                 BERLIN
</b>                        Is she lying, Ross?

     For a moment there is an intense trust between ROSS and BERLIN.

<b>                                 ROSS
</b>                        Yes.

     Alright fuck it. Let's go for broke. BERLIN grabs the read out.
     Fueled on residual anger he vanishes out the door. ROSS is fir-
     st at the mirror to see him reappear in the interrogation room.

<b>     55:  INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM.  POLICE STATION.  DAY.
</b>
     The polygraph machine looks like state of the art. A table and
     two chairs. BERLIN takes one and sits opposite EMERSON. She at-
     tempts a smile but he kills it with the intensity of his stare.

<b>                                 BERLIN
</b>                        My name's Sergeant John Berlin.

     And the time is his. He knows what he's doing. And she doesn't.

                        I been a policeman 17 years: 16
                        years 9 months of which with the
                        L.A.P.D. I witnessed literally
                        hundreds of lie-detector tests,
                        and I never seen one like this?

<b>                                 EMERSON

<b>                                 BERLIN
</b>                        Well, look at it. Look at this
                        line? That's the important one.
                        Dead straight down the page. No-
                        body gets a dead straight down
                        the page. Even our expert says
                        a dead straight's "exceptional."

     All he's doing is telling her truth. Up to her to interpret it.

                        Thought you might wanna comment?

     A tongue slides through the lipstick like something being born.

<b>                                 EMERSON
</b>                        I wasn't actually lying, Officer.

     And suddenly the only thing holding her chops up is Max Factor.
     He's got her on the roll now and all it needs is one more push.

<b>                                 BERLIN

                        truthful statement you made's your
                        name .. Your name is Carol Emerson?

     The quivering lip and flooding eyes amalgamate into a horrible
     sort of groan. She's bellied up and anxious to spill her beans.
     BERLIN better get through the door fast because he might laugh.

                        You tell one more lie, you're go-
                        ing in a cell. Sergeant Ross is

<b>     56:  EXT.  ROSS'S BOAT.  HUMBOLDT BAY.  EUREKA.  DAY.

     A wave atomizes and comes down like silver champagne. HELENA &amp;
     BERLIN hang on the prow of the boat with the ocean rushing bel-
     ow. Another wave and more spray for HELENA. She turns like get-
     ting sea in your face is the best invention ever. Oilskins sat-
     urated and her hair streaming and she knows he's loving it too.

<b>     57:  INT.  WHEELHOUSE.  BOAT.  DAY.
</b>
     Sunshine &amp; spray on the windshield. ROSS at the wheel with MAR-
     GIE next to him. Eyes on BERLIN &amp; HELENA playing like children.

<b>                                 MARGIE

     Stairs descend to a cabin and ROSS interrupts himself to shout.

                        Bobby, what happened to that
                        beer? Rule one, is you don't

     BOBBY clatters up the stairs clutching a six pack of Budweiser.

                        Tell em I'm going up the coast
                        a way, get out of this weather.

     Wind over and sea content and anchored about a mile from shore.
     Smoke from a dying barbecue and Nat King Cole croons "Unforget-
     able." ROSS sports shades and sits staring down the line. Some-
     one plays lousy guitar and he shifts eyes into the well of the
     boat. HELENA teaches BOBBY to play chords. Hardly worth the ef-
     fort but they're enjoying it. BERLIN looks down from the oppos-
     ite side of the deck. His gaze interrupted by MARGIE "You want
     another Coke, honey?" Sure he does and her eyes travel to ROSS.

<b>                                 MARGIE

     In code so BERLIN won't understand. But he and ROSS swap grins.

     MARGIE climbs the stairs with drinks and drinks a beer herself.
     Popped cans change the subject. This seems like a question BER-
     LIN doesn't really want to ask &amp; MARGIE doesn't want to answer.

                        How's your little sister?

     BERLIN is more amused than annoyed. They arrive at the car and
     his suggestion is met with an appropriate response from HELENA.

     "I can't drive a car." Doesn't like cars. But he's not hearing.

                        drive me around in circles ..

     No lady ever had a driving lesson like this before. BERLIN all
     but sits in her seat. Arm on the back of it. Hand on the wheel.
     For a split second they're doing 60. Now they're doing about 4.

     The Mercedes spirals in widening circles. Instructions and enc-
     ouragement from BERLIN .. O.K. .. Straight now .. The Mercedes
     straightens and heads through the dunes. "It's a big car park?"

                        We're going along a little track.

     HELENA may like driving but she doesn't like the sound of that.

                        It's O.K. It's not a public road.

     Headlights behind them approach quickly. Disappear and reappear
     as they follow the geography of the dunes. BERLIN only now bec-
     omes aware of them. one more dip and they slam in. Her anxiety
     is misinterpreted. He takes the wheel. No problem. Let him pass.
     The vehicle is right up behind them. As it overtakes HELENA is
     scared. And still scared even though BERLIN has stopped the car.

                        It's alright, I'm sorry. It was
                        my fault, it wasn't a good idea.

     Christmas ads interrupt the movie. BERLIN sighs in frustration.

                        Alright .. Let's have some wine ..

<b>     64:  INT.  BOOTH.  "ANGELA'S BAR."  NIGHT.

     A shabby booth with black and whites of the two unrecognizable
     Celebrities who ate here. Hamburgers are almost over and a bot-
     tle of wine almost drunk. Both look tanked and especially ROSS.

<b>                                 ROSS

                        there. Remember me? Up to my asshole

     Waving his empty at the bar ROSS communicates need for another.

<b>     65:  INT.  ADMINISTRATION.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.
</b>
     Very late and the only light comes from coloured bulbs pulsing
     on a Christmas tree. Apparent BERLIN has had too much to drink.
     Makes it to his desk and shuffles at the messages. One is just
     about important enough to get a close-up. "TIME 18:52: SUBJECT:
<b>     A MAN CALLED DAN STANLEY TELEPHONED:  SAYS THERE ARE 109 JOHNS
</b><b>     WITH VOLKSWAGEN VANS IN BAY AREA: WILL TELETYPE INFO THIS P.M."
</b>
<b>     66:  INT.  CRIME LAB.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.
</b>
     BERLIN finishes typing something. Tears it out and seals it in
     an envelope. Shirt sleeves and yawns. He slumps in the chair &amp;
     stares at "Jennifer 8." Fuck this for a Friday night. He's had
     enough of it. Grabs several envelopes and turns out the lights.

<b>     67:  INT.  ADMIN/OFFICE.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.
</b>
     BERLIN emerges from one office and heads for another. J.K. Tay-
     lor on the door. Delivers the envelope and an his way out when 
     something detains him. Lights on the tree strobe through venit-
     ian blinds. Illuminate bits and pieces of rattan. Plus a board
     covered in Christmas cards and a pair of steel filing cabinets.

     Maybe motivated by the booze? But a desk drawer is open almost
     before he realizes it and he searches for a key. Nothing but a
     bunch of business cards and family snaps. Taylor with his Moth-
     er Taylor with his Sister (red hair like him) and Taylor with
     his Dog. The drawer slams and one underneath opens.  Same flot-
     sam of personal junk. Scotch Tape and paper clips and more bus-
     iness cards. A bottle of tablets and salad of loose ammo. Fuck
     all else and he closes the drawer. But what's this? A cane let-
     ter rack at the rear of the desk where he finds a pair of keys.

     Excitement lasts as long as it takes to try them. Don't fit ei-
     ther lock. Now he's staring at the shadows with nothing moving
     but thoughts. A few moments more and he's heading for the door.

<b>     68:  INT.  OFFICE.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.
</b>
     Massive close-up of the lock. A weird looking tool goes in and
     another follows it. This bastard ain't easy even for an expert.
     The frame widens to reveal BERLIN. He shuffles picks in a wall-
     et on top of the cabinet. Was that a noise somewhere? He stops
     to listen. wipes cold sweat away. Only thieves and foxes about.

     A final twist and the lock delivers. Several dozen manilla col-
     ored files from which to choose. A pair of folders titled Jenn-
     ifer travel to the desk. The first is full of press-cuttings &amp;
     some gruesome looking snaps. Next file and this one looks more
     interesting? A notebook full of random questions/answers/comm-
     ents. A list of ships and sailing times. "MUST FOLLOW THIS UP"

     Underlined twice. "CAN'T OVER ESTIMATE IMPORTANCE." Also under-
     lined. Lists of numbers. Street numbers? Vehicle numbers? What-
     ever they might be is history because the neon just flashed on.
     TAYLOR stands in the doorway. The surprise is mutual. The play
     one-sided. This is already TAYLOR's game. Smokes his cigarette.
     BERLIN is up to elbows in the jam jar and up to him to explain.

<b>                                 BERLIN

                        like I'm sharpening a pencil with
                        a broken load .. I'm sorry, King J ..

<b>                                 TAYLOR
</b>                        What are you looking for?

<b>                                 BERLIN

<b>                                 TAYLOR
</b>                        Wrong cabinet.

     He gestures to the right one. BERLIN feels about 2 inches tall.

                        I'm gonna get some coffee. When you
                        finish in here, maybe you'll let me
                        know? .. I got a report to type up ..

     As he exits he tosses a bunch of keys. They crash uselessly on-
     to the desk. BERLIN looks like he couldn't get a fuck with mud.

<b>     69:  EXT.  ROAD.  TRINITY VALLEY.  DAY.
</b>
     The mood is low as it goes. And so is the angle. Ultra low beh-
     ind the car. Just road and a blur of tires. The frame widens &amp;
     the Mercedes fills it. Brake lights on as it descends the hill.

<b>     70:  INT.  TRINITY VALLEY/ROAD.  DAY.
</b>
     BERLIN in big close-up. His face like the Music. Here come the
     gates of the Institute. As he turns in he stamps the brakes. A
     van veers past him. Nothing special about it except it's a V.W.
     He watches it vanish up the hill with other things on his mind.

<b>     71:  INT.  CORRIDOR.  INSTITUTE.  DAY.
</b>
     Christmas vacations and the building sounds deserted. BERLIN's
     foot steps might be the only sound in the place. They stop and
     a bell rings. Ho tries to assemble sox* kind of appropriate ex-
     pression. But as soon as she opens the door it's obsolete. HEL-
     ENA looks pretty as flowers &amp; delighted he's here. She reaches
     for his hands. And every new second makes it a tougher goodbye.

<b>     72:  INT.  APARTMENT.  INSTITUTE.  DAY.
</b>
     Oh Jesus look at this. She prepared him a surprise dinner. And
     she looks so happy about it. A pathetic little table with cand-
     les and Forget-Me-Nots and can of Diet Coke by his plate. He's
     barely through the door and goodbye is already in deep trouble.

<b>                                 HELENA
</b>                        I wanted it to be a surprise.

     BERLIN's face gets ready for something he doesn't say. Why did
     she have to do this? And why didn't he tell her over the phone?

<b>     73:  INT.  APARTMENT.  INSTITUTE.  DUSK.
</b>
     A Schubert Sonata in the background. Candles low and the atmos-
     phere junk. Evening already in the room and it feels like time
     to go. But first he's gotta toll her something he doesn't want
     to hear himself. "Would you like me to make some fresh coffee?"

<b>                                 BERLIN
</b>                        I have to talk to you, Helena.

<b>                                 HELENA
</b>                        I know.

<b>                                 HELENA

                        since you got here. But you been
                        thinking pretty loud ..

     She stands and collects the cups and gets halfway with a smile.

                        I'll make some more coffee.

<b>     74:  INT. KITCHEN.  APARTMENT.  DUSK.
</b>
     A hiss of running water. Close on the kettle. Close on the tap.
     She knows what he's going to say. And now she's alone her face
     doesn't mask her feelings. She's missing him already. But does-
     n't know why. Simply knows she doesn't want him to say goodbye.

     She reaches high into a cupboard. Her shirt stretches over her
     breasts. Christ this girl has a great figure. Carting hair out
     of her eyes she returns to the sink. For an instant she's star-
     ing out of the window and right into somebody's face. Tall and
     weird looking. But just a glimpse before he moves rapidly away.

<b>     75:  INT.  APARTMENT.  DUSK.
</b>
     BERLIN has moved to the sofa. A shaft of dead sunlight crosses
     the apartment. HELENA comes in making a brave face of it. Does-
     n't realize he's moved. "I'm here, Helena." And she smiles and
     changes direction. Puts the coffee tray on a table in front of
     him. No music now and all sounds in close-up. Close on the lip
     of the coffee pot as she pours. Close on the cup she gives him. 
     Everything close in Helena's world or her world wouldn't exist.

<b>     76:  EXT.  (P.O.V. FROM FIRE ESCAPE)  INSTITUTE.  DUSK.
</b>
     Not a lot to look at but the man is looking in. From his P.O.V.
     he's fortunate. HELENA sits facing him but BERLIN has his back
     to the window. This sort of surveillance is always ominous and
     here is no exception. BERLIN's explanation comes with occasion-
     al use of hands. HELENA suddenly smiles so it can't be all bad.

     They stand and BERLIN reaches for his coat. HELENA crosses the
     room. Finds her Forget-Me-Nots and now they're his at the door.
     As he takes them he takes her hand. Kisses her finger tips and
     can't avoid embracing her. They kiss like awkward kids bumping
     noses. Finally part and disappear into the dark of the hallway.

<b>     77:  INT.  ELEVATOR/CORRIDOR.  INSTITUTE.  DUSK.
</b>
     BERLIN is already in the elevator. Resists doors determined to
     separate them. They shunt in and out perpetually informing him
     he's on the 4th floor. "I'll call, O.K." She nods and releases
     his hand. He watches her walk all the way back up the corridor.

<b>     78:  INT.  MERCEDES SEDAN.  TRINITY VALLEY.  NIGHT.
</b>
     Headlights follow the meandering road. Another bend and lights
     in the distance. In seconds he's passing the Diner. Still open
     with cars out front including the white Volkswagen that nearly
     busted his fender. He's not gonna stop. Then decides to. Makes
     a U and pulls in. Parks a couple of vehicles away from the van.

<b>     79:  INT.  KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM/BEDROOM.  APARTMENT.  NIGHT.
</b>
     HELENA finishes the dishes. Stacks a last plate and closes the
     cupboard. Heads back into the living room. Something about the
     apartment doesn't sound right? She follows the noise through a
     door into a bedroom. Curtains dance in the darkness and behind
     them she finds a half open window. Curious because she doesn't
     remember leaving it open? Secures it and silences the icy wind.

<b>     80:  EXT.  VOLKSWAGEN VAN/CAR PARK.  DINER.  NIGHT.
</b>
     BERLIN checks the driver's door. Locked and he explores with a
     pencil-flashlight. Moves to a slide door at the side. Simultan-
     eously the door to the Diner opens releasing a quartet of midd-
     le-aged Drunks. He dissolves while they bullshit around. Laugh-
     ter in chill air. The Comedian of the night keeps himself amus-
     ed. Jokes about getting into the wrong car with the wrong wife.
     BERLIN isn't laughing "C'mon, you drunken fuck. Get outta here."

<b>     81:  INT/EXT.  VOLKSWAGEN VAN/CAR PARK.  DINER.  NIGHT.
</b>
     A slide door rolls open and BERLIN peers in. Full of furniture
     and cardboard crates stenciled "TRINITY INSTITUTE - CRAFT DEPT."
     Worth the try but forget it. This bastard obviously has legit-
     imate business at the institute. Takes a last poke around with
     the light. Spots something red. A cigarette butt caked in lip-
     stick. But what's this white stuff? Some kind of powder spills
     from a capsule crushed in the door rails. He picks it up for a
     look and gets a bad one from behind! "Whatta you doing, Mister?"

     BERLIN finds himself facing an irate looking Woman in her 20's.
     A lot of red hair and freckles. But definitely more frightened
     than angry. His Police Department badge is an instant sedative.
     Gives her some crap about thefts from vehicles round here. She
     should keep her doors locked. She smiles and thought they were.

<b>                                 BERLIN

     She hands it across and he inspects it coz that's what cops do.

                        I noticed you coming outta the
                        institute. You up there a lot?

<b>     82:  INT.  BATHROOM/LIVING ROOM.  APARTMENT.  NIGHT.
</b>
     If there's moonlight that's the only light. Nothing to see but
     a pair of large taps. Nothing to hear but a bath filling. Then
     something starts bleeping. It's a liquid-level-indicator activ-
     ated by rising water. A hand searches for taps. Shuts them off
     and silences the indicator. The frame expands to reveal HELENA.

     She moves to a hand basin. Finds a brush and fixes hair. Finds
     a clip and pins it up. Close as she kicks off shoes. Pantyhose
     descend on top of them. Walks into the living room unbuttoning
     her shirt. Vanishes into the bedroom and the Camera waits. Ret-
     urns with towels and the Camera follows back into the bathroom.

     A creaking hinge as she closes the door. A dressing gown hangs
     on a hook. She reaches for it and turns and virtually bumps in-
     to the Sonovabitch. Dressed in black and stealthy as a cat. He
     retreats a pace deeper into the darkness. Just enough light to
     see he wears glasses. And just enough light to see her undress.

     HELENA unzips her skirt. Slides it down her lags. Drapes it on
     a chair. Removes her shirt and hangs it on the back. She wears
     a white brassiere and panties. And no apologies for repetition.
     This is a fantastic body. She checks water temperature. Either
     too hot or too cold. Either way a tap goes on. Now she reaches
     behind her back. Unclips her bra. Gets hit with dazzling light.

     The Intruder is taking photographs. And if this is his turn-on
     he's in paradise. She stands in front of him in total oblivion.
     Her panties join clothes on the chair. Nov she's naked and now
     another picture. Again the bathroom detonates with white light.

     His face is concealed by the camera. But this bastard is about
     to run out of luck. Moves in as she silences the tap. Suddenly
     a lot of silence about. HELENA twists in panic. She just heard
     something? Didn't she just hear something? Is somebody in here?
     Fear kills her scream. She hits at the darkness. But he's gone.

<b>     83:  INT.  LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN.  BERLIN'S HOUSE.  DAY.

     Big close on telephone ringing. No one home except the machine
     and Camera. The former answers on behalf of Berlin [John, it's
     me .. please call me .. I left two messages at the police stat-
     ion .. they said you weren't there .. please, please, call me].
     The camera moves on. Breakfast remains on the table. Newspaper
     still in its wraps. Out the window a bonfire rages in the yard.

<b>     84:  EXT.  YARD.  HOUSE.  DAY.

     BERLIN clears rubbish from the garage. Grime and sweat and the
     effort's got him breathless. Heaves another armful on the fire.
     The phone starts ringing again. This time he decides to answer.

<b>     85:  INT.  CORRIDOR/ADMIN.  POLICE STATION.  DAY.

     BERLIN in a hurry to get there. Footsteps tell the story. Fast
     up a corridor and through a door. Faces look as he crosses the
     department. SECRETARIES and BISLEY and ROSS. But only one face
     of interest. TAYLOR turns halfway through lighting a cigarette.
     "Are you outta your fucken mind?" TAYLOR says nothing. "If any-
     thing happens to that girl, I'm gonna break your fucking back."

                        So the case is closed, so what?

     His indifference inflames BERLIN. Smashes the newspaper at him.

     His cigarette is already stubbed and he's already walking away.

                        Why don't you get yourself a dict-

                        is blind as a blonde fucken bat.

     A big mistake Mister Taylor. Mister Berlin suddenly turns into
     Harrison Ford. TAYLOR slams into filing cabinets right next to
     the Christmas tree. Gets BERLIN's forearm under his throat and
     fucking lucky not to get the knuckles in his gut. Both men are 
     heaving. No volume necessary in this room of paralyzed silence.

<b>                                 BERLIN

     BERLIN moves away and the silence is brutal. Nothing happening
     but bad vibes. ROSS and BERLIN exchange glances, And this shit
     is really bad. BERLIN vanishes into his lab and the door slams.

     BERLIN and his Dummy wearing a bra and his photographs and his
     rage are all alone. And that's how they wanna be. But the door
     opens and here is ROSS. Have to be a friend to survive in here.

                        I told you what was gonna happen &amp;

                        good enough for the "committee?"

     And as long as you like evaporates before ROSS can speak again.

     BERLIN is drinking whisky. Sticks another slug in the cup. Now
     realizes whose bottle this is. Slams it somewhere on the bench.

                        Here. You left your booze in here.

     Ross gets the kind of smile a smart guy wouldn't give an idiot.

                        You think it was him?

<b>                                 BERLIN

                        jerk-off. Some peeping-tom prick.

     His hand has found the switch-blade. A nasty click as it opens.

                        .. but definitely not him. This
                        guy's in the trade. He's not gon-

                        if he's in the room, she's dead ..

     BERLIN puts the knife in his Dummy. If she's alive. She's dead.

<b>                                 ROSS

                        able. But there's also a reason-
                        able explanation for the opposite.

<b>                                 BERLIN
</b>                        Don't give me that! Not another
                        word! When you had the Fat Lady
                        in there, and I asked you if she
                        was lying, you looked me right
                        in the eyes and said yes. So as
                        far as I was concerned, she's ly-
                        ing. And if the King of fucking
                        England had walked in &amp; told me
                        different, I wouldn't have bel-
                        ieved him - because you told me ..

     This atmosphere would stretch any friendship to breaking point.

                        And now I'm telling you. I'm looking
                        you right in the eyes and telling ya,
                        there's a "bad man" out there, and I
                        don't know if he's in the next room,
                        or the next state: and I don't know
                        what his trigger is? But if he reads
                        her name in the newspaper, I believe
                        he'll be inclined to do something ab-
                        out it. I've got a bad feeling. And I
                        been doing this too long to be wrong.

     There are tough eyes to look into. And ROSS finally looks away.

     Wide over the countryside. The car is a long way off. A pretty
     magic looking dawn. Cows on hills and mist in the hollows. The
     Mercedes finally arrives. Up the track and into the (refurbish-

     hope so .. right now, I'm scared to be there .. who? .. just a
     second .. O.K. .. just a second.. Goodridge wants the number?"
     She seeks decision from BERLIN who doesn't want him to have it.

     And that's it except for "Goodbyes." He takes the phone and re-
     places it. Her expression is a toss up between guilt &amp; anxiety.

     Only thing he fails to mention is which guy he's talking about.
     Anyway the subject is already changed. He notices tapes in her
     bag. "Would you like me to put your music on?" No, she doesn't
     want music. O.K. He's gonna light the fire and make them lunch.

     Christmas cards. Several photographs from the happy years. One
     a picture of Ross &amp; Berlin in uniform. Another features Berlin
     with his arm around a beautiful young lady with long dark hair.
     For a moment it could be Helena? But the Camera's already gone.

     HELENA cuddles knees in the corner of a sofa. Looks considerab-
     ly more relaxed. But there's a tension here and both are aware
     of it. Stifled yawns. She stares at him and BERLIN stares back.
     A billion people in love have been through this. It's bed-time.
     [A suggestion of Berlin's bed to be is heaped in pillows/blank-
     ets at the end of the couch.] "Come on, I'll take you up there."
     She finds his hand and stands. The Music follows them upstairs.

     Moonlight through the windows. They are silhouettes. They want
     to embrace but in a situation like this a bedroom is the worst
     place to be. No sound except the Music. And what's anyone supp-
     osed to say? This atmosphere is about kissing and nothing more.

     Christ hear this Music. A sweet pulse of Puccini. Big close of
     lips meeting in moonlight. Now in each other's arms. They kiss.
     And then they're kissing. And nothing else is happening in the
     whole fucking universe except a telephone just started to ring.

     Still ringing. Still kissing. Somebody has got to give in. The
     phone finally gets answered. The voice at the end isn't expect-
     ed. But BERLIN sounds pleased to hear it. It seems one problem
     got solved. "I gotta tell you, Margie. You are Mrs Santa Claus."

<b>     92:  INT/EXT.  KITCHEN/REAR ENTRANCE.  ROSS'S HOUSE.  DAY.
</b>
     Is Ross throwing a party or opening a bar? Crates of booze and
     stack upon stack of beer. A bit of "where do you want it?" act-
     ing from BERLIN as he staggers in with a delivery of Bud. ROSS
     makes room on a table. Rips a beer out the plastic and pops it.

<b>                                 BERLIN
</b>                        Can't thank you enough, Ross ..

<b>                                 ROSS
</b>                        Don't thank me. Thank Margie.

     Swallowing beer ROSS exits the back door with BERLIN following.

                        It's her invitation. And as
                        far as Citrine in concerned,
                        better we keep it like that.

     The wagon waits outside with a few crates left to unload, BER-
     LIN heads for his Mercedes with ROSS calling after him. "John.
     Here." Pulls a six pack from his supplies and throws it across.

                        There's an old desperado in
                        one of the cells. Why don't
                        you give him this, and tell
                        him happy Christmas from me?

<b>     93:  INT.  BEDROOM.  THE ROSS RESIDENCE.  DAY.
</b>
     The Girls prepare for festivity. They got a full length mirror.
     A wardrobe of dresses. A menu of shoes, What they do with them
     in this scene is their affair. Right now MARGIE's holding some
     blue number in front of HELENA."It's blue silk. You like blue?"

<b>                                 MARGIE
</b>                        Not "you" blue. This isn't you.

     She slings the dress on the bed. It joins a pile of rehearsals.
     Moves deeper into her dresses and HELENA appears in the mirror.

<b>                                 HELENA
</b>                        When did John divorce?

<b>                                 MARGIE
</b>                        Two or three years ago.

<b>                                 HELENA
</b>                        What was she like?

<b>                                 MARGIE
</b>                        Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi-
                        professional model. But a policeman's
                        wife she wasn't. So one day, she just
                        packed it and left. And his whole life
                        went straight down the nearest toilet.

<b>                                 HELENA
</b>                        What does that mean?

<b>                                 MARGIE
</b>                        You know, he crashed. He just couldn't
                        come to terms with it .. John hates to
                        lose, and he hated losing her .. Every
                        spare minute, he's driving down to San
                        Diego, having a terrible time with her,
                        getting drunk, and driving back .. you
                        just don't believe the amount he drank ..

     She pirouettes with black sequins. "What do you think of black?"
     Evidently not much and MARGIE is getting short of alternatives.

                        Wait a minute, I just had
                        the most brilliant idea ..

<b>                                 HELENA
</b>                        You think he still loves her?

<b>                                 MARGIE
</b>                        Think he still thinks about her. But
                        not like then. Then was an obsession.

     She emerges from the wardrobe with red satin high heeled shoes.

                        Here .. try these .. if these
                        fit, we got the perfect dress ..

<b>                                 HELENA
</b>                        I haven't worn heels since I was 16.
                        I don't think I could walk in these?

<b>                                 MARGIE
</b>                        Sure you can. Anyway, parties
                        are all about standing still ..

     HELENA is excited to try them out. The experiment is a success.

                        I'll go get the dress .. It's kinda
                        sultry .. I only wore it once, coz
                        in reality, I can't get away with it ..

<b>                                 HELENA

<b>                                 MARGIE

<b>     94:  EXT.  HOUSE.  NIGHT.
</b>
     The Ross residence looks like an ad for J&amp;B. Warm yellow light
     from the windows. Holly wreath on the front door. The Mercedes
     pulls up and BERLIN gets out with his bag and suit on a hanger.
     A hard wind around the house. He walks inside without knocking.

<b>     95:  INT.  DEN.  HOUSE.  NIGHT.
</b>
     The den looks like a little museum. Walls decorated with Civil
     War memorabilia. One wall occupied by a cabinet of modern guns.
     ROSS looks like Roy Rogers trying to look like Fred Astaire. A
     powder blue evening suit. Ho dumps ice in a barrel full of Bud-
     wieser and BERLIN produces a couple of presents. "This is from
     Helena. And this is from me." The first obviously a music tape.
     ROSS holds it to his ear. "Sounds like Frank Sinatra?" And the
     second a bottle of (Ross tears the wrappings off) Chivas Regal!

<b>                                 ROSS
</b>                        Let's do one of these right now,
                        then we'll hide the sonovabitch.

     But he's already lost BERLIN's attention. MARGIE walks in with
     HELENA. Jesus what have you done to her? Bright red lipstick &amp;
     jet black mascara and dress made of blood red sequins. Sexy it
     is but her it isn't. She looks like one of those big tit dopes
     from Tennessee. She also looks like 37 million dollars. Christ
     that smile works with paint. An appraisal comes from ROSS "Wow."

<b>     96:  INT.  LIVING ROOM.  HOUSE.  NIGHT.
</b>
     The whole house is going around in a haze of booze and colored
     lights and laughter. Buddy Holly supplies the music "True Love
     Ways" and ROSS is a victim of the nostalgia. Dances close with
     MARGIE. Among the kaleidoscope of passing couples are HELENA &amp;
     BERLIN. Eyes closed and oblivious of everything but each other.

     But someone is staring at them. About forty years old with big
     hands. Too old for acne but the skin is bad. Got a scar on his
     cheek like a ladder in a stocking. He continues to stare until
     the dancers separate. Music ends and he's already in the crowd.

     BERLIN arrives with a whisper for MARGIE and next thing HELENA
     is on her arm heading for the stairs. Obviously a "ladies room"
     run. Everly Brothers next record up and SERATO appears through
     the crush. Spots ROSS who wants to know "What happened to you?"

<b>                                 SERATO
</b>                        Duty Sergeant fucked up .. can
                        you believe it, I'm on tonight ..

     "How long have you got?" "One big drink." And they head for it.

                        Did you get my message?

<b>                                 BERLIN
</b>                        No.

<b>                                 SERATO
</b>                        I left a message on your machine.
                        It wasn't me calling. Sam around?

     This last question to ROSS who delivers a typically large shot.

<b>                                 ROSS
</b>                        Yeah .. I guess she's in the kit-
                        chen .. We got a so-called prof-
                        essional cook out there having a
                        nervous breakdown over a turkey ..

<b>                                 BERLIN

<b>                                 SERATO
</b>                        I spoke to old whass-his-name
                        a couple of times. But not to
                        her, and I never asked for her ..

<b>                                 ROSS
</b>                        Her who?

<b>                                 BERLIN
</b>                        Someone's calling the institute
                        to talk to Helena. Says he wants
                        to ask her some more questions ..

<b>                                 SERATO
</b>                        Not guilty ..

     And he pushes off to see his wife. BERLIN looks around worried.

<b>                                 BERLIN
</b>                        You got a quiet phone somewhere?

</b>                        Hey, John, don't start getting
                        antsy over this tonight. It may
                        well have been the local cops?

<b>                                 BERLIN

<b>     97:  INT.  BATHROOM.  HOUSE.  NIGHT.
</b>
     MARGIE fixes HELENA's lips. Big on the lipstick. Another layer
     of magenta is going on "Are you sure I look O.K." Her question
     interrupts the Revlon "You're the prettiest girl here by about
     two hundred per cent." MARGIE moves in again for the lower lip.

<b>                                 MARGIE
</b>                        How you doing on those shoes?

</b>                        Don't mix very well with beer.

     Perhaps she is a tiny bit tipsy? MARGIE smiles and says "Press."

<b>                                 MARGIE
</b>                        Girl like you should be drinking
                        chill white wine. Press. All done.

     A knock on the door. "Come in" and BOBBY sticks his head inside.

<b>                                 BOBBY
</b>                        That woman in the kitchen says
                        if she doesn't get help within
                        10 seconds, she's gonna resign.

</b>                        That woman is a disaster ...

     She turns to the mirror in exasperation and mends her own face.

                        Alright, tell her I'm coming. No,
                        wait a minute, honey. Take Helena
                        for me, and find John? And don't
                        let go of her hand until you do ..

<b>     INT.  LIVING ROOM/DEN.  HOUSE.  NIGHT.
</b>
     A pause in the Music amplifies conversation. Bullshit and beer
     and everyone talking about nothing. BOBBY leads HELENA through
     the row. Can't find Berlin and now they're in the den. The ser-
     ious Guzzlers have made it base. Everyone talking and everyone
     lying but no Berlin and BOBBY is about to make a major mistake.

<b>                                 BOBBY
</b>                        I'll just go see if he's in the
                        kitchen .. you stay right here ..

     Her protest is absorbed in sound. And anyway he's already gone.
     At once she is vulnerable. Doesn't know if she's staring at the
     back of a head or straight into someone's face. "Didn't we meet
     somewhere?" The question comes from the man with the scar. He's
     drunk as a dog and already got a tattooed hand around her waist.

<b>                                 VENABLES

                        about to ask this lady for a dance?

     Trash aftershave and lousy breath and clearly the answer is no.

                        If I told you I'd driven all the way
                        from Oakland would you dance with me?

     Willy Nelson starts to sing. And HELENA attempts to break away.

                        What's so special about the other guy?
                        You like cops, don't you .. I'm a cop ..

     HELENA finds the top of a couch. Holds it like a raft of secur-
     ity. But where ever she goes this frightful mouth is following.

                        .. let me ask you a question? How do
                        you know the difference between one
                        guy and another? .. Maybe you don't ..
                        Maybe you only know the "difference"
                        when you're dancing? (he laughs) If
                        you knew what I looked like, you'd
                        dance with me. I look like John Wayne ..

<b>                                 HELENA
</b>                        I know what you look like. Excuse me.

     She navigates the back of the sofa. Collides with somebody and
     apologizes. "I'm sorry. Is anyone sitting there?" Enough ambiv-
     alence in the question for the guy not to know she's blind. No.
     No one sitting there. Simultaneously a pair of middle-age crew
     cuts occupy the sofa. A second later HELENA sits bang into one
     of the laps. Spilt drinks and surprise all round. Pleasant sur-
     prise for the victim. He's a lecherous looking old bastard and
     Helena's dress rides up for a damned good view of the lingerie.

     Every humiliation there is. However HELENA gets out of this is
     however she achieves it. But by the time she does she's crying.

<b>     99:  INT.  HALLWAY/STAIRS.  HOUSE.  NIGHT.
</b>
     A calm spot between kitchen &amp; stairs. In the background Guests
     raid the kitchen for food. BERLIN looks like he should be smok-
     ing a cigarette. At last MARGIE comes downstairs with the news.

<b>                                 MARGIE

     ROSS already arrived. BERLIN looks desolate. She can't go back.

                        You better go talk to her ..

     ROSS watches him walk upstairs. His eyes an assessment of this
     absurd relationship. "All sorts of people fall in love, Darlin."

<b>                                 ROSS

<b>     100:  INT.  BEDROOM.  HOUSE.  NIGHT.

     A wedge of light as BERLIN walks in. Then moonlight again. HEL-
     ENA sits at the edge of a single bed. Hair a wreck and mascara
     streaks down her face. He sits identifying himself with an emb-
     race. Clears the hair from her eyes and kisses where the tears
     were. "It was an accident .. everyone has accidents." Whatever
     he said would be the wrong thing to say. Because he doesn't un-
     derstand. And her only explanation of this misery is new tears.

<b>                                 HELENA

     Gently he reaches down and takes off her shoos "You don't have
     to dress like this for me." And suddenly the mood is different.
     He is amongst her tears. Kissing her mouth. Already undressing
     her. Her dress glides up. Silk stockings. He unclips them. She
     feels his hands drift down her legs. Hears the zip opening her
     dress. She returns his desire and helps him with her brassiere.
     He kisses her breasts and by now the Camera's too close to see.

     HELENA asleep in BERLIN's arms. Just the worry of the wind. He

     From somewhere a very soft sound of Christmas carols drifts in.

<b>     102:  INT.  STAIRS/LIVING ROOM/DEN.  HOUSE.  NIGHT.
</b>
     This is deep past midnight, The house is quiet and gone to bed.
     Fallout from the party everywhere. Still that distant sound of
     carols. BERLIN dumps his bag and walks into the den. Just dark-
     ness and the forgotten tape machine. Flips on a lamp and tries
     to open the gun cabinet. Still trying when startled by a voice.

<b>                                 ROSS (O.S.)

                        That's "Comanche Proof."

     BERLIN swings round in surprise. ROSS is half asleep on a sofa.

<b>                                 BERLIN
</b>                        Jesus. What are you doin?

<b>                                 ROSS
</b>                        I spose I'm drinking myself to
                        sleep. It's Helena's Christmas
                        songs .. they're really pretty ..

     "Silent Night. Holy Night" and about two inches of Chivas left.

<b>                                 BERLIN

                              (Ross does)
                        Twenty fives?

     BERLIN sticks a foot on a table. Pulls a .25 Walther automatic
     from an ankle holster. Ejects the mag and clicks out the slugs.

<b>                                 ROSS
</b>                        What exactly you doing, John?

<b>                                 BERLIN
</b>                        I'm going up to the institute.

<b>                                 ROSS

                        she gonna be there over Christmas.

     ROSS unlocks a cabinet and BERLIN is about to load the Glasers.

                        I checked with the locals and our
                        station, no one's called. Whoever
                        it is, isn't the police.  I think
                        this bastard's getting worried ab-
                        out something? .. and I think the-

</b>                        Well, let's hope he does ..

     ROSS selects a 12 gauge Winchester and rams the mechanism open.

                        And if he does, I'm gonna
                        drop a bomb on the fukker.

     ROSS is stuffing solid lead "car killers" into the pump action.

                        Watch my lips. I'm your partner.

<b>     103:  EXT.  SHASTA-TRINITY INSTITUTE.  NIGHT.
</b>
     This is probably a crane shot. A gale works up the valley. The
     institute is in total darkness. Not a vehicle out front. Not a
     sound except the marauding wind. Ross's Chevrolet is concealed
     amongst trees. Been here long enough to allow slow flurries to
     accumulate. It stares towards the building maybe 75 yards away.

<b>     104:  INT.  CHEVROLET SEDAN.  NIGHT.
</b>
     BERLIN wears a black wool hat. ROSS a big black overcoat. Both
     got shit frozen out of them. A bottle available and anyone who
     wants a slug better help himself. Plus sleet on the windshield
     and a lot of stale time. BERLIN asks what time it is? And ROSS
     takes a heave on the booze and waits for about a week to go by.

<b>                                 ROSS
</b>                        Where's your watch?

</b>                        It's twenty of three.

     Yawns do a circuit. ROSS flops in his seat and the angle chang-
     es. The view from the rear covers windscreen and back of heads.

                        A little young for you, Bro?
                              (Gets his eyes)
                        You think if she could see,
                        she'd be hanging around with
                        an old dog like you? You got
                        a stomach growing around to
                        meet itself behind your back.

     A star-light on the windshield. Distant and nobody seen it yet.

                        its fifties. Balls in their six-

</b>                        Hit those wipers, Ross.

     Urgency snaps him into close-up. Big noise as wipers clear the
     screen. "I thought I saw a light?" BERLIN stares at the instit-
     ute through small binoculars. "There. Flashlight went right ac-
     ross those windows!" Instant excitement as the adrenalin pumps
     in. "Fourth floor. See it? He's fucken in there!" And suddenly
     everything including super-sinister Music is happening at once.

<b>     105:  EXT.  CHEVROLET.  INSTITUTE.  NIGHT.
</b>
     Pines singing as the gale tears into them. Clutching his Winch-
     ester ROSS opens the trunk. A dim light and a fluster of equip-
     ment. BERLIN sorts out a pair of radios. Selects a channel and
     ROSS whispers "What are you on?" ("local Tac.") Here come huge
     12 cell flashlights and the intense whispers continue. "Local?"

<b>                                 ROSS
</b>                        What if we need a back up?

<b>                                 BERLIN
</b>                        We're not here. I don't
                        want the desk to hear us ..

     O.K. it's channel 4 and copy? And they're already on their way.

<b>     106:  EXT.  BACK OF BUILDING.  INSTITUTE.  NIGHT.
</b>
     The storm bullies its way around the building. Lights approach
     quickly. But one of them is already fading. It belongs to ROSS.
     This fucker's got about 5 minutes in it. And whatever the plan
     was it just got changed. BERLIN looks around in apprehension -
     going in there alone ain't no joy - his flashlight ascends the
     fire escape. And there it is 2 floors up. A half opened window.

<b>                                 BERLIN
</b>                        Alright. I'll start at
                        the top, and work down.

<b>                                 ROSS
</b>                        You ain't going in alone?

<b>                                 BERLIN
</b>                        That's a liability, Ross. I
                        don't want you hanging on to
                        my shirt. Anyone but me comes
                        down these stairs, take em out
                        but try and keep him alive. I
                        want this bastard living ..

     Takes off up the stairs. ROSS watches him vanish. (Waiting out
     here ain't so tasty either.) The wind rages in nearby trees. A
     door slams repeatedly somewhere a long way away. [Ross?] "10/2"
     [I'm going in.] Big on ROSS and the radio. "You take care, Bro."

<b>     107:  INT.  REAR STAIRWELL.  INSTITUTE.  NIGHT.
</b>
     BERLIN climbs through the window. Drops down and waits to orien-
     tate himself. He's on a small landing midway between flights of 
     stairs. Different kinds of noises in here. One hundred per cent
     more sinister. "Ross. Ross? You hearing me?" [10/2]. "I'm going 
     upstairs." Snaps the safety-catch on his Beretta. And it sounds 
     ominous. Every shadow in this place is animated with foreboding.

<b>     108:  INT.  STAIRWELL/CORRIDOR.  INSTITUTE.  NIGHT.
</b>
     Looking down the stairwell. The light comes up. BERLIN arrives
     on another floor. Hard to sweat in here but he's doing it. His
     progress is distinctly cautious. A harsh wind rockets down the
     stairs flapping a pair of owing doors. BERLIN eases through in-
     to the corridor. At its far end is the elevator. He travels to-
     wards it in an eerie piston of light. [John? What's happening?]

<b>     109:  EXT.  REAR OF INSTITUTE.  NIGHT.
</b>
     ROSS has moved into the shelter of a wall. Sleet passes almost
     horizontally. His flashlight is over. The color of a tangerine.

<b>                                 ROSS [BERLIN]
</b>                        [I'm on Helena's floor .. I'm

                        apartment .. You O.K.] Fucken

                        ing, Brother? [I can hear some-
                        thing? .. Something upstairs?]

     110:  INT.  CORRIDOR.  INSTITUTE.  NlGHT.

     BERLIN stares up at the coiling "I can hear footsteps .. right
     up above?" They disappear into the gale. Doors beat at the end
     of the corridor. He moves towards them and pushes out onto the
     stairway. Nothing but the wind. He's about to climb when an al-
     arming voice shocks him rigid. "YOU ARE NOW ON THE THIRD FLOOR."

     BERLIN is already running. Light swinging wildly as he sprints
     back up the corridor. Fifteen yards to elevator/stairs. Breath-
     less as hell he hits the radio. "Fucker's in the elevator." Al-
     most jumps stairs in haste. Bursts out onto the 3rd floor. Ham-
     mer back on the Beretta. Just in time to see the doors closing.

     "Get ready, Ross. He maybe coming down." But he isn't. He's go-
     ing up. By the time he's recovered breath the Voice is back in
     business. Whoever rides the elevator is now on the fifth floor.

<b>     111:  INT.  STAIRWELL.  INSTITUTE.  NIGHT.
</b>
     Totally breathless now. Eyes ascend faster than feet. Whine of
     a swinging door. BERLIN rounds the stairwell. The door's still
     busy. Top of the building here and the ceilings are closing in.

     BERLIN'S P.O.V. as he heads for that door. Closer. Three steps
     to go. Closer. Two steps more. One step. Reaches for it. Whamm! 
     The door smashes into him like it hates him. So fast it hardly
     happened. He staggers back. His flashlight clatters downstairs.

     Banisters capsize as the light passes. Every shadow goes crazy.
     The flashlight arrives at a lower level. Rolls away and stops.
     Wastes power into a corner. Can't see Berlin and can't see his
     radio. But Ross cuts into the silence with increasing disquiet.

                        [John? John? Are you al-
                        right? .. Come in, John?]

<b>     112:  EXT.  REAR OF INSTITUTE/FIRE ESCAPE.  NIGHT.
</b>
     ROSS savaged by the gale. In considerable anxiety. Less than a
     volt in his batteries. His failure to contact Berlin accelerat-
     es his concern by the moment. Calls repeatedly "You hearing me?"

     Big close on the radio. Fingers switch channels. Tries calling
     on five/six. Still nothing and goes to channel eight. "Come in,
     John?" Alright fuck it. Light or no light. He's going up there. 
     Still calling he barges at the wind making for the fire escape.

                        [You hear me? Just be care-
                        ful now, coz I'm coming up]

     Stares up into the gloom of the iron stairs. Hardly got a foot
     on the first before a Figure rushes down. Dressed in black and
     very breathless. A powerful flashlight floods on dazzling ROSS.

                        Is that you, John? .. Ans-
                        wer. NOW .. Or I blow this
                        fucken staircase to pieces.

<b>                                 BERLIN [?]
</b>                        Me, Freddy.

     Thank Jesus the anxiety's over. The 12 gauge drops to his side.

<b>                                 ROSS
</b>                        What the hell's going on up there,
                        Brother? I been calling 10 minutes.

     The light remains steady and blinding and straight in his face.

                        Hey, c'mon, John .. Talk to me ...

     Just the sound of breathlessness. Plus a .25 Walther automatic.

                        Jesus Christ .. What are you doing?

     It glints at the peripheries of his vision and ROSS is alarmed.

                        What the fuck are you doing? - It's
                        me - Holy shit! - John - John - Not
                        you - Don't shoot you crazy bastard!

     Two deathly flashes in quick succession. The first practically
     taken Ross's hand off. The second slams into his guts and he's
     down. The Glaser is unequalled in ferocity by any other bullet.

<b>     113:  EXT.  FIRE ESCAPE (ATTIC LEVEL).  INSTITUTE.  NIGHT.
</b>
     The MYOPIC JANITOR looks down. Five floors below a man lays on
     his back. His shotgun discharges uselessly into trees. Another
     man leans over him. Illuminates his agonized face with a flash-
     light. Shoots him again point-blank in the upper body. The MYO-
     PIC isn't staying for more. Hurries back along the fire escape.

<b>     114:  INT.  ATTIC APARTMENT.  INSTITUTE.  NIGHT.
</b>
     Wind breaks on the roof like waves. An utterly dismal room lit
     by a starving light bulb. The MYOPIC arrives from the fire esc-
     ape. Huge eyes behind those orb-like glasses. Picks up a phone
     and dials. Piles and piles of old newspapers. Hundreds of fuck 
     magazines. In the kitchen section a mass of photographic equip-
     ment includes an enlarger on the table a flash camera.  On the
     wall behind him a collage of snaps of half dressed girls. Plus
     a special enlargement of Helena standing naked in her bathroom.

<b>     115:  EXT.  REAR OF INSTITUTE.  FIRE ESCAPE.  NIGHT.
</b>
     Close on a bulb in a flashlight. The merest glimmer of energy.
     Barely the light to see the blood. It seeps into a long-frozen
     footprint in the ice. Fills it fast and expands over the sides.

     Somebody say this can't be happening? BERLIN crumples to knees
     in the snow. Dumps his light gasping for breath. Oblique light
     creating desperate silhouettes. BERLIN howls like a dog. Howls
     into his radio. "Nine - Nine - Nine." Blood all over his hands.

     "This is a Nine - Nine - Nine - officer down." ROSS is heaving 
     like an old bull elephant. On the verge of unconsciousness. He
     tries to speak. Got hit in the throat. BERLIN fights off tears.

     "Don't talk old man." Repeats the emergency code but this time
     he can't be heard. Almost imperceptibly a Carol filters in (In
     The Bleak Mid Winter) and the Camera moves slowly away. BERLIN
     cradles ROSS's tragic head and the song drowns the raging wind.

     This beautiful Christmas carol will articulate rhythm of these
     cuts. And there will be no other sound until the sequence ends.

<b>     116:  EXT.  CITY STREET.  CITY HOSPITAL.  NIGHT.
</b>
     A blue emergency light. Revolving in slow motion. Like a dream.
     The city streets are a blur. The light accelerates into sudden
     reality. Ambulance plus police convoy speed to a city hospital.

<b>     117:  INT.  EMERGENCY ROOM.  HOSPITAL.  NIGHT.
</b>
     Close-up of MARGIE kissing her husband's lips for the last time.
     Tears spill down his cheeks from her eyes. FREDDY ROSS is dead.

<b>     118:  INT.  WAITING AREA.  HOSPITAL.  NIGHT.
</b>
     Outside in the corridor. Looking in at BERLIN. He sits head in
     hands on a bench. This is somebody's point of view. The camera
     travels up the windows. Waits at a distance as CITRINE arrives.
     Pajamas under his clothes. He walks with assistance of a stick.

     Neither say anything because both know what this is about. BER-
     LIN stands and hands over his badge. Exits the mag and now his
     Beretta. A brief word from CITRINE and he turns and walks away.

<b>     119:  EXT.  LANDSCAPE.  BERLIN'S HOUSE.  DAWN.
</b>
     A little house in winter meadows. Kind of pretty now it's pain-
     ted. Just the first tint of pink on its roof. The Carol dissol-
     ves into birdsong. Here comes the sun for a fine Christmas day.

<b>     120:  EXT.  VERANDA.  HOUSE.  DAWN.
</b>
     All new paint and all new things in expectation of happy times.
     A barbecue still in polythene wraps. Price tag and unconnected
     gas pipe shift gently in the breeze. A brand now swinging seat.

     BERLIN sits in it with shock wearing on. Expressionless of sor-
     row. Though he suffers every sorrow and guilt and regret there
     is. Sunlight reaches the veranda and colors the end of it red.
     silent and motionless he watches the lousiest dawn of his life.

<b>     121:  EXT/INT.  THE ROSS RESIDENCE.  LIVING ROOM.  DAY.
</b>
     Lights glow on the Christmas tree. Unopened presents still und-
     erneath. SERATO sits smoking in silence. Listens to a sound of
     plates getting stacked in another room. He looks up but not in
     surprise. He just wasn't aware BERLIN had arrived in the house.

<b>                                 BERLIN

     Stunned and stubbled and full of grief. And that's just SERATO.

<b>                                 SERATO
</b>                        Taken Bobby to her sister's ..

     This atmosphere is unbearable and even these whispers seem laud.

                        They were going there anyway.

<b>                                 BERLIN

     SERATO shakes his head. Loses his cigarette. And SAMMY appears.

</b>                        Thinks his dad's in hospital.

     SAMMY SERATO is 30 and pretty. She continues collecting plates.

                        Why'd you go up there, John?

     Knows he's not going to get a reply and doesn't bother to wait
     for it. HELENA materializes from the den like a shadow. Sallow
     for want of sleep and glad to have BERLIN's hand to hang on to.

<b>                                 BERLIN

     A suggestion that surprises HELENA. And clearly doesn't appeal.

<b>                                 HELENA

                        ions now .. Not right now ..

     If silence can intensify it's now. Sound of the front door and
     then footsteps. BERLIN freezes as MARGIE appears. Wracked with
     grief. Dead sickness of tears. Like she cried bones out of her
     face. But no weeping now. Maybe shock. Maybe brave. Maybe both.

<b>                                 HELENA

     The strongest face in the house. And now HELENA is in her arms.

                        old cop and he didn't like tears ..

     Dead echos of plates in the kitchen. And song of birds outside.

                        Feels like every second in my life,
                        was just the moment leading to this.

     Raises her hand to silence him and this is silence Margie owns.

                        Don't.

     Christ this is just awful. HELENA crying and BERLIN on the way.

                        What's gonna happen now, John?

                        to .. I'd like her to .. I'll look
                        after her .. and she can look after

     The Camera will slowly crane down on BERLIN. Fully dressed but
     wiped out he lays an the bad. Last thing he needs is booze. He
     is clearly full of it. Drifting in and out of consciousness. A

     A memory that is too terrible to bear. BERLIN gets up and sits
     at the edge of the bad. Head in hands. Wants the pain to go aw-
     ay. But anguish is stronger than alcohol. Hears noises outside
     and makes it to a window. Tears curtains back revealing lights.
     His Mercedes hangs in space as though staring into the bedroom.

     The man from the F.B.I. is 50. Black suit and wing tips. All F.

     fellow looks like both. When he smiles it's a decaffeinated ex-

     on a twin spool tape recorder. But no sound of yakking in here.
     St Anne's ASSISTANT sucks a pencil. Busy with a cross-word puz-
     zle. Fills in a word but the Camera isn't interested. It moves
     away to discover head phones. And moves closer to hear St ANNE.

                        [Always figured I'd like to retire

</b>                        Because he reads I'm investigating
                        the disappearance of her friend, &amp;
                        Miss Robertson becomes the focus of
                        his anxiety. How good of a "witness"
                        is she? He's crazy, but not stupid,
                        he's intelligent. Got a flexible M.
                        O., and he doesn't wanna get caught.

                                 St ANNE
                        Just like "Jack The Ripper?"

     This is meant to humiliate and meant to annoy and it does both.

                        Alright, we'll have plenty of time
                        to discuss your "Mystery Man," and
                        his "flexibility" later, Right now,
                        I'd like to talk about the "event."

                        I was in possession of it ..

                                 St ANNE

                        Nothing. Static. I got blood on
                        my hand, realized my eye was cut.

                        down the fire escape, and right
                        at the bottom, I found Ross ..

                                 St ANNE
                        You figure you lost it in the

                        Like the flashlight? [Yeah] Had

     The chair moves back in and its pilot has an icicle up his ass.

                        You said you figured it had fallen
                        down the stairs with the flashlight?

                        The man who shot Ross, used it ..

     Implications are ganging up quicker than BERLIN can focus them.

                        And you don't know where that little
                        twenty-five calibre Walther's gone?

     BERLIN confirms it. Looking very concerned. The wheels retreat.
     St ANNE shakes out a cigarette and takes his time with matches.

                        O.K. Sergeant, here it is. I intend to
                        produce evidence, that will prove you
                        shot Frederick Ross with malice afore-
                        thought. My angle therefore, is to pre-
                        pare a case on behalf of your Chief, to
                        prosecute you for first degree murder.

     A yellow cab splashes through puddles and pulls up in front of
     the house. HELENA gets out and pays. No she doesn't need assis-
     tance. Picks up her suitcase and the cab vanishes into drizzle.

<b>     135:  INT.  KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM.  BERLIN'S HOUSE.  DAY.
</b>
     Back door opens and HELENA walks in. First thing she senses is
     cold. This place smells like it hasn't been lived in since she
     was last here. And last time she was here she was happy. Dumps
     her case and heads for the living room. Can't see it but feels
     the overwhelming gloom. Finds a couch and now she sits to wait.

     The silence is almost total. But something disturbs it. HELENA
     looks around. Back on her feet she tries to discover source of
     the sound. Finally arrives at a table lamp. She feels the bulb
     and it's hot. A large moth beats itself crazy inside the shade.
     Reaches in and turns it off &amp; the house is in virtual darkness.

<b>     136:  INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM.  POLICE STATION.  DAY.

     St ANNE lights a cigarette. Attention with his notes. Sniffing
     a fair bit. He's acquired a toilet roll to deal with it. Occas-
     ionally will tear a sheet or two off to blow his nose. Glances
     at BERLIN "You want a cigarette?" No he doesn't "I've given up."

                                 St ANNE
                        You have? .. How about the booze? ..

     How does St ANNE know? Perhaps he doesn't? Sounds like he does.

                        Too much booze can be very dangerous ..
                        memory black outs .. stuff like that ..

     His attention still with notes like a quack about to prescribe.

                        "The Man Takes a Drink, Then the Drink
                        Takes a Drink, Then the Drink Takes

                        have been real breathless by then?

     BERLIN doesn't know where this is going but he doesn't like it.
     Eyes to BERLIN now and his smile looks real for the first time.

                        We're gonna get our "observer" in
                        here this afternoon. Keep an eye

                        withholding information, the F.B.I.

     St ANNE makes a note. Junks the pencil. Sits back in his chair.

                        Were you aware there was a janit-
                        or in the institute that night?

     St ANNE breaks off to blow his nose. BERLIN looks very worried.

                                 St ANNE
                        I'm really catching cold up

<b>                                 BERLIN
</b>                        No.

                                 St ANNE
                        Alright, let me answer your question?
                        "What's the relevance of the janitor?"

     Hits the cigarette like this is the one that caused the cancer.

                        Why don't I take you through it, from
                        where I'm sitting .. At some time bet-
                        ween 2 &amp; 2:30 a.m. the janitor thought
                        he heard a vehicle approaching through
                        the woods. He looks out, and sees noth-
                        ing, no lights, nothing. Figures it must
                        be hunters. Some time later, he thought
                        he heard something else, like a door, or
                        a window slam? He gets up, and between
                        half past two and a quarter of three, he
                        makes a search - with a flashlight - of
                        the top 3 floors. Finds nothing untoward,
                        &amp; goes back to his apartment in the roof.

     BERLIN looks grey as sick. Knows what's coming. And here it is.

                        The flashlight you saw, was his. The
                        "footsteps" you heard, were his. The
                        elevator you were chasing up and down
                        after was empty, and is prone to such
                        activity, due to an electrical fault ..
                        Apparently it happens frequently dur-
                        ing gales. The gale that was swinging
                        the door. That knocked you down. That
                        confused you so much? And here we are,
                        back to where I'm sitting. You wanna
                        tell me what really went on that night?

     It seems St ANNE has effectively destroyed the "Serial Killer"
     scenario. Stubs his cigarette and waits for BERLIN's response.

<b>                                 BERLIN
</b>                        Two people know I didn't kill
                        him, Mr St Anne. One's me, and
                        the other's the man that did.

                                 St ANNE
                        What man?

     St ANNE is winning. And they both know it. And he almost grins.

                        We just dealt with "the man?"

<b>                                 BERLIN
</b>                        How d'you know the Jan-
                        itor didn't shoot him?

     If St ANNE can raise an eyebrow he does. By implication BERLIN is
     ditching his "Killer." During this St ANNE rewinds his Sony.

                        You're telling me it's his
                        flashlight I saw, O.K., he
                        sees my flashlight? And I'm
                        coming up the stairs with a
                        Beretta in my hand. And he's
                        frightened. He hits the door
                        on me. Picks up my gun. He's
                        running. He runs into Ross,
                        and in panic, he shoots him.

     The little Sony snaps to a stop and St ANNE looks at his watch.

                                 St ANNE
                        Not unless he had a gun in one
                        hand, and a phone in the other,
                        he didn't. Ross was shot at ex-
                        actly two fifty-seven a.m. The
                        janitor put a call through to
                        the local police, at 2:57 a.m.
                        You obviously realize how I can
                        get so accurate with my timing?

     St ANNE backs off and carefully replaces the Sony on the table.

                        Ross switched into channel 8, &amp;
                        we got a recording of the whole
                        incident. I was gonna play it to
                        you, but I got a meeting, we'll
                        have to do it after lunch. It's
                        one, let's make it back by three?

<b>     137:  INT.  BEDROOM.  BERLIN'S HOUSE.  DAY.
</b>
     HELENA is curled up under blankets. Maybe day-dreaming but not
     asleep. She's maybe here to keep warm as much as anything else.
     Sound of a vehicle approaching and she sits to listen. The car
     pulls up and its engine silences. HELENA is already out of bed.

<b>     138:  INT.  LIVING ROOM/PORCH/FRONT YARD.  HOUSE.  DAY.
</b>
     Silhouette of a figure outside the front door. Someone rattles
     the handle but it's locked. And by the time HELENA reaches the
     door the visitor has gone. Thinking it's Berlin she twists the
     key and steps onto the porch. A stale winter fog settling down.

     Hardly a sound except her own voice. "John? Is that you?" Just
     the rattle of local Crows and a Bull heaving somewhere in some
     distant field. "John?" She cautiously descends wood stairs and
     walks two or three paces before bumping into a brown Chevrolet.

     Exploration of the car establishes nil. More confused than con-
     cerned she listens. Country sound and not a sound out of place

     Then suddenly she is alert. Something clatters somewhere. Like
     cans kicked in the garage? Was it the garage? "John, is it you?"

<b>     139:  INT.  KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM/BEDROOM.  HOUSE.  DAY.
</b>
     HELENA locks the front door. Moves into the kitchen. Locks the
     back door. Glum silence in the house. Nothing but an old alarm
     clock ticking. Then a sound like something moving. Like a door
     creaking open? Was it in the garage? The living room? Upstairs?

     She returns to the living room. Curtains drawn and almost dark.
     The endless silence is interrupted by a rush of water in pipes.
     If anybody's here they're upstairs? HELENA moves to the bottom
     of them "John, are you up there? It's me, darling. I got a cab."

     The only reply is more silence. She begins to climb the stairs.

     One hand on the wall. She ascends slowly. Her helplessness giv-
     ing way to suspicion with each new step. At the top she pushes
     into the bedroom "John, are you here? Darling? Are you alright?"

     Apparently no one is here. Certainly no one in the bed. And no
     one in the bathroom. She reappears with an expression suppress-
     ing anxiety. Feels her way past an antique wardrobe. Curiously
     its door is open. A full length mirror inside. Shuts it as she
     passes and for a split-instant the Man in the room is revealed.

     Almost simultaneously fingers in black leather clasp her wrist.
     HELENA in speechless with shock. Both she and the INTRUDER are
     breathing hard. The only other sound is the wardrobe door whin-
     ing open again under its weight. Manifests a reflection of his
     back. Totally in black. Black wool hat. Leather jacket. Gloves.

<b>                                 INTRUDER
</b>                        Got really fucken lucky, didn't ya?

     He backs her to the bed and sits her before releasing his grip.
     The frame remains static and staring into the mirror and still
     on the INTRUDER's back. HELENA stares unseeing at her own face.

                        I was getting kinda concerned about
                        you Jenny. Like, how blind are you?
                        Blind as your friend? Or less blind?
                        Coz she could see, you know. Had a
                        view outta one of em. But you don't
                        see nothing do you? Nothing at all?

     He reaches into his jeans and produces a stainless steel knife.
     Even closed this thing is 10 inches long. A leather loop attat-
     ched at one and. He teases the metal in front of HELENA's eyes.

                        Can you see this, blind girl?

     Not a switch-blade but by snapping it like a whip it locks out.

                        Gimme your hand.

     Too terrified to obey and her inability momentarily angers him.

                        Gimme your fucken hand.

     HELENA lifts her hand and he takes it. He runs the edge of the
     blade over her palm. Then closes her fingers around the handle.

                        You like it?

     She is paralyzed except for the tears spilling down her cheeks.

                        I cut your friend's
                        head off with that ..

     Words come out she can barely hear herself. "You are a coward."

                        You say something, Jenny?
<b>                        
</b>     In this terrible silence she hears a double hiss of an aerosol.

                        I'd like to cut you. I'd like to
                        cut you so bad .. But ain't life
                        strange? You're my little buddy

     Fog and dusk in that order. Headlights descend the slope. Park
     and CITRINE plus cane get out. As he crosses the lot a Uniform
     fires up a Harley. Next face is SERATO heading for his car. He
     accosts the Chief with a piece of paper. It is read with escal-
     ating incredulity. This would be comic if it wasn't so serious.

</b>                        Would you ask Mr St Anne
                        to come in here a moment?

     The ASSISTANT does it via phone. And BISLEY looks over unhappy.

<b>                                 BISLEY
</b>                        I hear I've been nominated
                        as an official "observer?"

                        one of you is going in today ..

     St ANNE comes in blowing his nose. CITRINE shoves him the mess~
     age. He reads it with similar incredulity (but perhaps a touch
     more amusement than Citrine) "What d'you wanna do with it, Sir?"

                        What do you wanna do with it?

                                 St ANNE
                        Let him have it .. I don't
                        mind putting a little salt
                        at the edge of his plate ..

<b>     142:  EXT.  FRONT YARD.  BERLIN'S HOUSE.  DUSK.
</b>
     A single light in a downstairs room. The house is stifled with
     fog. A brown police Chevy parked out front. Here comes another
     to join it. As BERLIN gets out SERATO appears on the porch. He
     descends stairs with the impartial expression of a working cop.

<b>                                 BERLIN
</b>                        I need a friend, Angelo.

     SERATO keeps it dispassionate. Ignores BERLIN's desperate eyes.

<b>                                 SERATO
</b>                        You got one.

     Puts a thumb towards the house and already heading for his oar.

                        She's a bad witness, John.
                        But a fucking lousy alibi.

<b>     143:  INT.  LIVING ROOM.  HOUSE.  NIGHT.
</b>
     This isn't a good place to be. A dismal lamp supplies light. A
     close-up Of HELENA on the sofa. Hears a sound of booze getting
     poured. But nothing else in the house except for a harsh voice.

<b>                                 BERLIN (O.S.)

                        house, and has a "chat" with you?

     By now BERLIN and his glass of anaesthetic are well into frame.

                        No one in the State of California
                        is gonna believe that. They got the
                        man in there - an A/1 F.B.I. inter-
                        rogator, and he's taking me to pie-
                        ces - doesn't believe a word comes
                        outta my head - not a word - no one

                        enough darkness, don't I?

     He doesn't want to. But now he's got to. And so here it comes.

<b>                                 BERLIN

<b>                                 HELENA
</b>                        Then why didn't he kill me?

     Back at the booze and he's almost inaudible "Stop it, will you?"

                        Why didn't he kill me, John?

     Something snaps in BERLIN and he throws his glass at the grate.

<b>                                 BERLIN
</b>                        Will you fucken stop it. I'm not

                        room with you, and lets you live ..

     And just as suddenly he's full of remorse. Takes HELENA in his
     arms with a lot of sorrys. But she isn't interested in apology. 
     There's a passion in her face. And fire even in her blind eyes.

<b>                                 HELENA

<b>     144:  INT.  GARAGE.  HOUSE.  NIGHT.

     Music slams in on the cut. Berlin is about to take this garage
     to pieces. He searches cans and boxes and stacked timber. What
     ever it is his eyes are looking. The Camera looks down from ab-
     ove. Bits &amp; pieces all over the floor but he discovers nothing.

<b>     145:  INT.  BATHROOM/BEDROOM.  HOUSE.  NIGHT.
</b>
     Close on a hand searching underside of the bath. Pipes and cob-
     webs. He reaches toward the taps. His hand is literally inches
     from the Walther (taped to the end of the tub). Fingers almost
     touch it. Just a fingernail away when HELENA interrupts "John?"

<b>                                 HELENA (O.S.)
</b>                        I just remembered something ..

     And BERLIN rolls out and stares up like a mechanic under a car.

                        He used a breath freshener.

<b>                                 BERLIN
</b>                        A "breath freshener?"

     HELENA stands in the doorway and BERLIN is already on his feet.

<b>                                 HELENA
</b>                        I heard it hiss, twice.

     BERLIN wipes a thought through his hair with fingers. "I don't
     know what that means." Walks past into the bedroom. Everything
     taken apart. Every drawer open and the bed heaped with clothes.

<b>                                 BERLIN
</b>                        ... he's either here to take

<b>     146:  INT.  LIVING ROOM.  HOUSE.  NIGHT.

     BERLIN pours last of the whisky. Looks totally snuffed out. He
     and HELENA sit on the same sofa but the atmosphere puts them a
     mile apart. A yellow pad on the table covered in notes. BERLIN
     swallows scotch and reads to himself "I guess we all got lucky?"

<b>                                 HELENA
</b>                        You gotta stop drinking, darling.

     Another mouthful of scotch &amp; she hears the glass hit the table.

                        He's glad you're drinking. Every
                        drink you take you're helping him.

<b>                                 BERLIN

     That's what she knows about alcohol and he'd prefer to be dead.

                        I lost everyone I ever loved .. I
                        lost my hopes .. my future .. I'm

     St ANNE is close enough to kiss BERLIN. Right into his space &amp;
     talking right into his face. And today he's not in a good mood.

                                 St ANNE
                        He humiliated you. In front of every
                        one .. In front of a bunch of secret-
                        aries? .. Well, that would piss any-
                        one off? ... That would piss me off ..

                        me, &amp; called himself a friend .. Coz

                        go bitchin on them behind their back?

     And he suddenly switches gear. And whispers like it's a secret.

                        He wasn't much of a "friend" at all?

<b>                                 BERLIN

<b>                                 BERLIN

                        ion, you're gonna tell me the truth.

     St ANNE shunts back in his chair. Expands the frame as he goes.
     Sergeant TAYLOR sits on a chair with his back to the wall. Cig-
     arettes and ashtray on the table next to his. St ANNE lights a
     Pall Mall and as if it's an after-thought he snaps the Sony on.

     BERLIN already looks devastated. He's about to got annihilated.

                        "Me, Freddy." .. [Just the gale] "What
                        the hell's going on up there, Brother?

                        heave for air) "Hey, c'mon, John, talk

                        ness] "Jesus Christ .. What are you do-

                        Don't shoot you crazy bastard! [2 shots]

     St ANNE clicks the Sony off &amp; BERLIN is too stunned to breathe.

                                 St ANNE
                        That's second degree - you wanna stop
                        at that? Will you give me that, John?

     BERLIN gives him nothing but silence. A knock on the door "Come
     in." And the ASSISTANT hands St ANNE a note. Reads it and excus-
     es himself. Leaves the silence for BERLIN. But TAYLOR breaks it.

<b>                                 TAYLOR

     TAYLOR lights a cigarette and exhales. Something of a real red-
     headed fuck about him. And BERLIN would like to break his neck.

                        You're letting it show, King Jay.

<b>                                 TAYLOR

     He rolls ash off his cigarette and pushes it round the ashtray.

                        Your an alcoholic, aren't you?
                             (BERLIN stares)

     The phone rings and TAYLOR answers. Puts his red eyes at BERLIN.

                        They want you to look in the mirror.

     BERLIN has to find every strength for this one. Humiliation com-
     pounds. Gets up and stares at his own haunted face in the glass.

<b>     148:  INT.  ANTI ROOM/INTERROGATION.  POLICE STATION.  DAY.

     The MYOPIC peers into BERLIN's face. St ANNE stands close with
     his toilet roll. Light refracts in the MYOPIC's lenses "I seen
     him up there quite a lot." St ANNE blows his nose "Is that the
     man you saw that night?" He stares again at the tormented face.

     St ANNE on his way to the door now. He pauses for the question.

     HELENA waits on a bench in the empty room. Maybe a few scruffy
     magazines? But nothing of use to her in here except she's near

     If the waiting room felt bad try sitting in here. Both St ANNE
     and TAYLOR are smoking and the Sony playing again. This is the
     final part of the tape. No speech but a lot of labored breath-
     ing. Ross groaning and now the sound of his shotgun. More desp-
     erate inhalations and now sound of the last shot into his neck.

                        it down in his book? "John Berlin
                        is a liar." Right here, underlined.

     BERLIN stares at the book &amp; can barely credit what he's seeing.

                        "break" with your "Mystery Man?"

                              (He doesn't)
                        Maybe he thought there was no "Myst-
                        ery Man?" That the investigation was
                        bullshit? That you were making it up?

     And during the next attack St ANNE will work himself into rage.

                        Coz you wanted to be "Top Cop?" Isn't
                        that why you went running up that gar-
                        bage dump, so everyone could stand in

                        Guy?" But Ross was "Top Guy", wasn't he?
                        Always would be Top Guy? And you know
                        what? He did it without even trying ..
                        Everybody loved him. He had everything
                        you wanted, didn't he? - Great woman -
                        Great kid? - Everything you couldn't
                        have? - And you wanted it to go away?
                        Coz your life was lousy, wasn't it? -

     Tears of grief and tears of rage. BERLIN can't restrain either.

                        What do you take for that
                        breathlessness, Sergeant?

     Can't take anymore questions. Answers with a shake of his head.

                        How about Aminophylline?

<b>                                 BERLIN

     Produces a capsule in a plastic bag and throws it on the table.

                        Came out of the ashtray of your car?

     Every cell in BERLIN's body freezes. Misinterpreted by St ANNE.

                        But you "don't know" what it is?

     But he does know what it is. The pill he found in the V.W. van.

                        You don't know how it got there?

     TAYLOR stares a rock drill and St ANNE stares something similar.

                        You don't use it for breathlessness?

     BERLIN focuses a fragment of hope. But no sign of hope in here.

                        I'm running outta questions, John, and

     BERLIN hurries in and grabs HELENA's hand. Instantly transmits
     the adrenalin. They head for the door with him whispering hard.

     BERLIN/HELENA couldn't have been in the house longer than it's
     taken to call Los Angeles. MARGIE infected with the excitement
     although as yet she hardly knows what's going on. BERLIN paces
     the tiles on a long phone lead. Eyes to MARGIE while they wait.

     Another excruciating wait plus further explanations for MARGIE.

                        I had the van - this guy drove that

     Dumps the phone and stokes anxiety in HELENA and MARGIE's eyes.

                        No Amanda with a white Volkswagen ..
                        You don't have a Yellow Pages for

     Everything happens in a hurry. He embraces HELENA. She'll pray
     for him. Already out the back door with MARGIE in tow. A black
     &amp; white parked in the drive with VENABLES stuffed inside. Plus
     a grim wind tearing trees. BERLIN pauses as he reaches his car.

     Wide over the bay area. Wind swept and rain swept. City lights
     beginning to come on. In the distance the docks and far beyond
     the ocean. Somewhere here is a solitary phone booth. "I'm look-
     ing for a special type of rattan .. friend of mine recommended
     you, said I should ask for someone called Amanda .. You don't?

     A stack of coins and a pair of ripped out Yellow Pages. BERLIN
     crosses off another number. Running out of craft shops and run-
     ning out of quarters. A new number hears the same old bullshit.
     But this one is answering good! Fights to keep his voice light.

                                 BERLIN (Phone)

     And he comes out of there running. The Chevy roars up the hill.

<b>     155:  INT.  ANTIQUE MARKET.  CRAFT EMPORIUM.  DUSK.
</b>
     The kind of store heads open in abandoned warehouses. A jungle
     of jewelry and cane furniture and ethnic junk.  Many chairs of
     the ilk Berlin saw in the Volkswagen van. And now he's staring
     at its driver. His P.O.V. through windows. He watches as a red
     headed Girl clears the till in preparation to close up. within
     moments the lights are dead and AMANDA is heading for her door.

<b>     157:  EXT/INT.  CAR/STREETS.  SUBURBS.  OAKLAND.  NIGHT.

     The Chevy tails the Datsun through city streets. A lot of rush
     hour traffic. Music to go with it and it's probably Mussorgsky.

     A final cut and headlights are navigating the hills. Disappear
     and reappear as they ascend. Steep inclines and the houses are
     middle class. Too dark to see much now but lamp posts and rain.

     Still climbing the Datsun takes a side street. BERLIN keeps 50
     yards behind. She turns off and parks in a sloping driveway. A
     white Volkswagen van at the top of it. BERLIN has already pull-
     ed over. Kills his lights and watches her hurry into the house.

<b>     158:  EXT.  STEEP STAIRS.  PORCH.  HOUSE.  NIGHT.

     BERLIN just rang the doorbell. Imposes an impartial expression.
     But this is his last chance and he knows it. The front door is
     opened &amp; secured on a safety-chain. AMANDA carries a white Cat.

     His hopes are collapsing by the moment and nothing else is left.

                        Would you mind if I took a look at it?

<b>                                 AMANDA
</b>                        I thought this was "routine?"

     The Cat cries for its food and AMANDA begins to look suspicious.

                        The only man that has driven it in
                        the last 6 months is my uncle. And
                        no way is he involved in a robbery.

<b>                                 BERLIN
</b>                        Could I have his name? Just so
                        I can officially eliminate him?

     Maybe too much charge in his head and she doesn't like the vibe?

<b>                                 AMANDA
</b>                        Could I see your badge again?

     Sure she can and he searches for it. "Must have left it at home?"

                        Then you better go and get it. I
                        feel uncomfortable without an I.D.

     AMANDA opens the front door just long enough for BERLIN to leave.

<b>     160:  INT.  LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN.  HOUSE.  NIGHT.

     The emerging Music is full of threat. Like it's part of the dark-
     ness. Too dark to see much of anything here. A sound of somebody 
     hammering at a door. A light outside and the Camera moves closer. 
     Creeps towards the door as though it's going to answer. Suddenly
     glass shatters. The door flies open. Flashlights and Men rush in.

<b>     161.  INT.  CHEVROLET SEDAN.  STREET.  NIGHT.

     BERLIN stares towards the house. Music and rain and a downstairs
     light just wont out. Headlights go on and the Datsun drives away.

<b>     162:  INT.  CHIMNEY FLUE/BEDROOM.  BERLIN'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.
</b>
     A flashlight searches cobwebs and soot. Descends the chimney and
     TAYLOR emerges from a long-sealed-off fireplace. Blinks dirt out
     of his eyes and moves back into the bedroom. Upended bed against
     the wall and everything upsidedown. The search looks like it has
     been thorough. St ANNE appears at the door and TAYLOR looks over.

     BERLIN searches the bedroom. Anxiety and antiques. Does a vanity
     and now a wardrobe. Nothing much in either. But finds a shoe box
     full of letters in the latter. Postcards/birthday cards etcetera.

<b>     164:  INT.  BATHROOM.  BERLIN'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.
</b>
     Half the floorboards already up. VENABLES levers at another. The
     music is nervous and louder. Next floorboard is next to the bath.

     Big close on a postcard (a fantasy yacht on a blue sea). The cap-
     tion reads "JUST ANOTHER DAY IN SAN DIEGO." Close enough to read
     the message ".. too hot .. asthma not too good .. as soon as I'm 
     settled I'll write .. love John .." Next letter out is also post-
     marked San Diego. Inside is a happy snap of Sergeant John Taylor.

<b>     166:  INT.  BATHROOM.  BERLIN'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.
</b>
     Almost too close to see what's happening. But a gloved hand just
     found a pistol under the bath. Out it comes with BISLEY shouting.
     And St ANNE and TAYLOR arrive. "Got a little Walther. It's a 25."

     HELENA looks at the floor and listens. MARGIE looks at the T.V.
     and listens. Big close on the screen. This scene will intercut
     between the television and those in front of it as appropriate.

     [1]  An exterior shot of Berlin's house. Sheriff's cars parked
     out front. Various people come and go. One of them is Sergeant
     Taylor. Perpetual wind on the sound track interrupted by a V.O.

     [2]  Heineman's B.M.W. pulls up outside the police station and
     this is conducted on the move. A Reporter asks "What's the nat-

     He pauses briefly an the steps with the wind savaging his hair.

     HELENA looks in utmost despair. "Is it true he resisted arrest?"

                        You'll have to put that question
                        to the Chief. I've nothing to add.

     BOBBY appears somewhere behind the Ladies. T.V. commentary con-
     tinues. "Meanwhile, Sergeant Berlin remains in a cell at police
     headquarters arraigned on what is believed to be  a $500,000.00
     bail. As Mayor Heineman said, this, is a 'sad day' for Eureka."
     Except for the one face that isn't sad and it belongs to BOBBY.

<b>     168:  INT.  CORRIDOR/CELLS.  POLICE STATION.  DAY.
</b>
     The cell window is reinforced glass. BERLIN smashes on it like
     an insane man. TRAVIS (apparently on cell duty) has never seen
     nothing like this before. CITRINE doesn't want to see any more.

<b>                                 BERLIN

     But he isn't and CITRINE moves off. BERLIN cracks blood out of
     knuckles on the glass. Hollers up the corridor after the Chief.

                        Get St Anne .. I want St Anne ..

<b>     169:  EXT.  DRIVE.  THE ROSS RESIDENCE.  DAY.
</b>
     Gale still making a mass of the trees. A police Chevy pulls up
     and TAYLOR gets out. Puts a knuckle on the window of a black &amp;
     white. A Uniform wakes and TAYLOR interrupts his apologies "Go."
     And the young Cop does the drive as TAYLOR heads for the house.

<b>     170:  INT.  STAIRS/LIVING ROOM.  THE ROSS RESIDENCE.  DAY.
</b>
     HELENA descends the stairs with her luggage. She's towards the
     bottom when TAYLOR appears via the kitchen. Lights momentarily
     stall as the gale sucks their electricity. Ignorant of his pre-
     sence she loses her bags and disappears into the den. He moves
     after her and startles the shit out of MARGIE as she comes out.

<b>                                 MARGIE
</b>                        Jesus. What are you doing here?

                        we're taking the guard off today.

     MARGIE heads for a table and unloads a strong-box of documents.

                        Is she going somewhere?

<b>                                 MARGIE

     He watches her select various papers aware of what she's about.

<b>                                 TAYLOR

                        I really wouldn't bother, Margie ..

     HELENA reappears wearing a coat and TAYLOR is in generous mood.

                        You want me to drive her? ..
                        I'm through with my shift ..

     Here's a classic twenty-two. BERLIN is consumed with anxiety &amp;
     rage. But get mad in here and get nothing. No shoe strings and
     no wrist watch. But a wrist-band like something medical summar-
     izing his charge. St ANNE sits impassive as BERLIN walks floor.

<b>                                 BERLIN

                        her and Margie here. I want an opp-

<b>                                 BERLIN

                        pretty dammed quick, Mr St Anne,
                        because if you don't, she's dead.

                                 St ANNE
                        Didn't push her down stairs on
                        their previous meeting, did he?

<b>                                 BERLIN
</b>                        He was up there to plant the gun.

                                 St ANNE
                        Did Taylor plant this, too?

     Produces a Zippo in a plastic sack and BERLIN's senses capsize.

                        Is it yours?

     A question for which St ANNE expects no answer and he is right.

                        We found "Jennifer Eight." At least,
                        we've found a headless and handless
                        girl. A couple of hunters found her.

     Maybe BERLIN asks him "Where" or maybe his expression's enough?

                        About 4 miles south of the institute,
                        less than 50 feet from the road. This
                        was less than 100 feet from the body.

     BERLIN can't believe it and knows St ANNE wouldn't believe him.

                        Is it yours? - (no answer) - I know
                        it's yours? - You know it's yours?
                        The only prints on it are Freddy's?
                        You wanna tell me how it got there?

     BERLIN wouldn't believe it either. Door open and TRAVIS enters.

<b>                                 TRAVIS
</b>                        Margie Ross put up your bond, Sir.

     St ANNE and BERLIN look surprised. And BERLIN looks at St ANNE.

<b>                                 BERLIN
</b>                        Are you getting in the way of it?

     St ANNE examines the bail/bond paper and raises eyes to BERLIN.

                                 St ANNE
                        I don't make the law.

     Music on the cut and this is a crane shot high above the house.
     A car tears up the drive with the Camera descending to meet it.
     BERLIN out and into the house. And still the gale howls around.

     Darkness and silence. Where the hell is everyone? He quicks it
     to the den, Cartoons on T.V. but no one watching. With escalat-
     ing concern he hits the kitchen and now he's shouting upstairs. 
     "Margie. Margie." About to climb when BOBBY appears at the top.

<b>                                 BOBBY
</b>                        There's no one here.

</b>                        Mom took her back to the institute.

     BERLIN freezes. He maybe says "What?" He definitely says "When?"

                        I dunno. How come they let you out?

<b>                                 BERLIN

                        ain .. gone to see Auntie Charles ..

     BERLIN has already grabbed a telephone. Aware it's dead before
     BOBBY tells him "They're all out around here." He wanders down-
     stairs in apparent oblivion to BERLIN's distress. BERLIN races
     back to the den and new problems. Desperate to get at the guns
     but all cabinets locked "Where's the keys, Bobby? I need a gun."

                        They're my Dad's guns.

<b>                                 BERLIN

                        wanna get the man that killed him.

     BOBBY stares at BERLIN as though he's staring at that very man.

</b>                        I hate you .. I really hate you ..

     He turns away into the darkness. BERLIN looks frantic and with-
     out options. Smashes the cabinets with a chair. Grabs a 44 rev-
     olver plus a 12 gauge Remington and the slugs that go with it.

<b>     174:  EXT.  FREEWAY INTERSECTION.  NIGHT.

     Wide over an intersection. Berlin's Chevy crosses a bridge and
     descends into lights. Music travels with him but the Camera re-
     mains static. Watches tail lights dissolve into a river of red.

<b>     175:  EXT.  FREEWAY.  NIGHT.
</b>
     Tracking back with the car. As yet 100 yards away. Moving fast
     and getting closer. As it approaches a remote sound of a phone
     drifts in. And headlights so near now they wipe out everything.

<b>     176:  INT.  CHEVY SEDAN.  FREEWAY.  NIGHT.
</b>
     Starting to sleet and windshield wipers on. The phone is still
     ringing like it's at the end of Berlin's brain. Like it's part
     of his thoughts mixed up with the nightmare he's hearing again.

     Intercutting BERLIN's fearful eyes with his P.O.V. of the road.

                        cunning. He's not going after her

     A miserable corridor with the merest of lights. A phone rings
     somewhere at its end. HELENA is on her way up the corridor and
     the ringing is louder. Finds keys and walks into her apartment.

     This is a little country stop some place an the peripheries of

     Screeches out onto the highway and the Camera begins to ascend.

     The Camera climbs higher revealing somber mountains. Plus mile
     upon mile of road he has yet to travel. Still it ascends until
     the Chevrolet is reduced to an insignificance by the landscape.

     lousier road on which to overtake. BERLIN is right up behind a
     forty ton truck and he's trying to overtake. Hits the horn and
     tries again. Halfway past the trailer when a bend suddenly rel-
     eases headlights. An angry claxon and he's forced to pull back.

<b>     183:  INT.  BEDROOM.  APARTMENT.  INSTITUTE.  NIGHT.
</b>
     Although curtains are open the room is in darkness. Someone on
     the fire escape looking in. A flashlight snaps on and a circle
     of light explores the room. Creeps across the floor and pauses
     at the bed. Climbs slowly to illuminate HELENA's sleeping face.

<b>     144:  EXT.  FIRE ESCAPE.  INSTITUTE.  NIGHT.
</b>
     Close-up sound and close-up picture. A glass-cutter scores the
     window. A nasty noise but you'd have to be wide awake and list-
     ening to hear it. A gloved fist punches the section out. Falls
     to the floor and shatters. And a hand reaches in for the catch.

<b>     145:  INT.  BEDROOM/LIVING ROOM.  APARTMENT.  NIGHT.
</b>
     HELENA is wide awake and listening. Hurrying into her dressing
     gown with a similar urgency to get out. She arrives in the liv-
     ing room as the FIGURE is clambering through the window. Panic
     as she blunders for the front door. Tears it open and vanishes
     into the corridor. He crosses the room and follows her outside.

<b>     186:  INT.  CORRIDOR/STAIRS.  INSTITUTE.  NIGHT.
</b>
     HELENA knows the building and moves faster than he may have ex-
     pected. Green dressing gown and bare feet. White nightgown and
     blonde hair. The man in black hurries after her. She's already
     at the swing doors and he's virtually running to stay with her.

     She bursts through the doors and rushes downstairs. He follows
     only seconds behind. The wind groans down as they descend. HEL-
     ENA turns a corner of the stairwell and momentarily disappears.

     For a moment he loses her! Which way did she go? Downstairs or
     along the corridor? His anxiety is immediately assuaged. Spots
     what already looks like a ghost fleeing into shadows. He takes
     off along the corridor. Getting breathless. But getting closer.
     Near enough now to sense her fear. Near enough now to grab her.

<b>                                 TAYLOR
</b>                        Say night, night, dead girl.

     As he reaches for her she turns. MARGIE wears a green dressing
     gown and a blonde wig and has a very big fucking pistol in her
     hand. TAYLOR can't believe what he's looking at. And for an in-
     stant neither does MARGIE. Their surprise is mutually stunning.

     How can it be him? How can it be her? TAYLOR's still trying to
     work out how they made the switch when the first bullet smacks
     into his chest. Gets another as he goes down. He crumples in a
     deadly heap and revenge is completed with two more in the back.

<b>     187:  INT.  LANDING/STAIRS.  INSTITUTE.  NIGHT.
</b>
     MARGIE barges through the doors. The MYOPIC Janitor is halfway
     up adjacent stairs peering down. No time for introductions and
     no time for explanations. "Call the Police. Do it. Now." Shout-
     ing up at him she's already descending. "Tell em the gymnasium."

<b>     188:  INT.  GYMNASIUM.  INSTITUTE.  NIGHT.
</b>
     MARGIE patrols plate glass windows. Where are the fucking cops?
     She's shocked and looks strange indeed. Wig off but hair grips
     all over her head. An overcoat and shoes but still wearing the
     nightgown underneath. A couple of dreary lights in the ceiling.
     HELENA sits numb under one of them all but hidden in a blanket.

     MARGIE can't stand waiting any longer. "I'm gonna call them my-
     self." HELENA nods and sure she's O.K. to stay here. The doors
     settle and she is alone. Headlights cross the windows shifting
     the shadows of everything. Swooping the walls they move attent-
     ion back to the door. TAYLOR stares in and then pushes through.

     Worse for wear but very much alive. Discarded his leather jack-
     et revealing the bullet proof vest. Blood all over his T-shirt.
     Looks like he caught one in the shoulder. A bad burn and blood
     runs from his left hand. In his right hand he clasps the knife.

     He cracks it open like a whip. HELENA hears it and stands. Ter-
     ror as the footsteps approach. "Margie. Margie." But Margie is-
     n't around. He's less than 30 feet away. She tries to back off
     but is hindered by the blanket. Tries to scream but is stifled
     with fear. Maybe six seconds to live but this refers to Taylor.

     "Taylor" He swings around but this time he doesn't get time to
     look surprised. BERLIN blows the fucker across the room. Solid
     load slugs weighing an ounce each crash into him. BERLIN keeps
     pumping the Remington and doesn't stop firing until the magaz-
     ine is over. No conjecture now. This bastard is very much dead.

     BERLIN throws the 12 gauge aside. And maybe it means something.
     Maybe at last he accepts he's stopped living in that world and
     ready to give himself a chance in this. HELENA in his arms and
     this is his new world. Flashing lights and headlights flood in-
     to the darkness. Their embrace goes on. And this story is told.
