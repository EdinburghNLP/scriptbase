Over the BLACK we hear the SOUNDS of two people making love.  A
MAN'S VOICE MOANS passionately.


FADE IN:


INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

ANDREW MARSH lies on his back in bed.  He is a frail-looking
man in his early sixties, with thinning gray hair.  On top of
him is a much younger WOMAN.  Although her back is to us, we
catch flashes of her face for a moment as she turns from side
to side.  We see enough to know that this is a beautiful woman.

She moves wildly, grinding her hips into him, her head arched
back, her hands rubbing lightly over her breasts.  She reaches
down, grabbing his hips and jerks them upwards, forcing him
deeper inside her.  They move together -- faster -- and faster.

The CAMERA slowly begins to PULL BACK.  As it does we see what
we are watching is on a TELEVISION.

Further back still.  We see TWO UNIFORMED POLICE OFFICERS
standing before the television watching the act.

The CAMERA begins to pan around the room.  Rain streaks down
the windows of the room -- LIGHTNING flashes outside.  A VIDEO
CAMERA is set up on a tripod.  More PLAIN CLOTHES POLICE,
looking, dusting, talking.

We continue to PAN.  We can now see it is the same room on the
tape.  ON the bed lies the naked body of ANDREW MARSH, a sheet
covering his lower torso.  His face is ashen, mouth open, his
dull eyes looking out in a fixed stare.  The last instant of
his life is etched upon a face frozen in pain.


EXT.  RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

LIGHTNING fills the night sky.  THUNDER BOOMS overhead.  The
wind whips the RAIN furiously against anything in its path.
The CAMERA moves slowly along rows of beautiful HOMES.  At the
end is a cul-de-sac.  Several POLICE CARS are in the driveway,
their RED LIGHTS FLASHING.

A four-door SEDAN pulls into the driveway.  JOHN CARDENAS steps
out into the rain.  He is a handsome Latin in his thirties,
with hard, chiseled features and black, slicked-backed hair.
He does not run through the rain -- he walks.

DETECTIVE REESE, a man who looks more like an accountant than a
homicide detective runs out to meet him.

								2


		CARDENAS
	Is it Marsh?

		REESE
	Yeah.

Just a hint of sadness shows on Cardenas' face.  It lasts an
instant, then it's gone.

		REESE
	Sir, do you mind if we get out of the
	rain?

Cardenas doesn't move.  He ignores the question.

		CARDENAS
	Who found him?

		REESE
	His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.

		CARDENAS
	She was here?

		REESE
	No.  She stopped by to pick up some
	papers.

		CARDENAS
	Show me.

Reese starts for the house.  Cardenas looks up into the night
sky.  A FLASH of LIGHTNING fills the SCREEN.


INT.  HOUSE, BEDROOM - CLOSE ON CAMERA - NIGHT

Pull back to reveal a POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER snapping pictures of
Marsh in bed.

Cardenas enters followed by Reese.  He moves through the
FORENSIC and MEDICAL TEAMS.  Anything Cardenas feels about the
gruesome sight before him is hidden behind a mask of
indifference.

Standing by the bed is ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY, ROGER
TROXELL, a short, baby-faced man.  Cardenas looks down at the
body, then over at the MEDICAL EXAMINER, DR. HENRY McCURDY, a
portly man with windblown cheeks and bloodshot eyes.

		CARDENAS
	How long?


								3

		MCCURDY
	About three hours.

		CARDENAS
	Cause?

		MCCURDY
	Not sure.  I'll have everything you
	need tomorrow.

		REESE
	Take a look at this.

Reese points to the nightstand drawer and Troxell opens it.  On
top of the nightstand is a box of tissues and a bottle of nasal
spray.  Inside are ROPES, HANDCUFFS and an assortment of SEXUAL
AIDES.

		TROXELL
	This guy was into some kinky shit.

Cardenas looks at the various sexual devices, then walks out of
the room.


INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT

JOANNE BRASLOW sits on chair.  Her eyes are tired -- red from
crying.  She is mid thirties -- attractive, but her looks come
more from effort than nature -- expensive hair cut -- the right
cosmetics.  She has a corporate look to her.

Cardenas steps into the hall and walks over to her.

		CARDENAS
	Miss Braslow -- I'm District Attorney
	John Cardenas.  You arrived at what
	time tonight?

		JOANNE
	A little after eleven.

		CARDENAS
	Why did you come by?

		JOANNE
	I had some papers to pick up.

		CARDENAS
	Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?

		JOANNE
	I assume his girlfriend.


								4

		CARDENAS
	Her name?

		JOANNE
	Rebecca Lawson.

		CARDENAS
	You wouldn't know her address, would
	you?

		JOANNE
	No -- but I can get it for you.

		CARDENAS
	Thank you.


INT.  HALLWAY, CITY HALL BUILDING - DAY

Cardenas walks down the corridor with McCurdy.

		MCCURDY
	Marsh wasn't alone.  We found traces
	of sperm on the sheets.  The
	toxicology report says there were
	high levels of cocaine in his blood.

		CARDENAS
	What'd he die of?

		MCCURDY
	The official cause of death was a
	cardiac arrest.

		CARDENAS
	The official cause?

		MCCURDY
	That's what my report will read.

		CARDENAS
	But there's more?

They reach a door and stop.

		MCCURDY
	It's speculative at this point.
	Marsh had advanced Arterial disease.
	His heart attack was induced by
	excessive aerobic activity -- in
	conjunction with the drug.

McCurdy enters the room.  Cardenas thinks for a moment, then
follows.


								5


INT.  CARDENAS' OFFICE - DAY

Spacious and sparsely furnished.  The walls are empty.  No
commendations, plaques or photographs to add prestige to the
office.  Cardenas steps into the room and looks at McCurdy who
is already seated next to Reese and Troxell.

		CARDENAS
		(to McCurdy)
	What are you saying, Henry?  That his
	girlfriend fucked him to death?

		MCCURDY
	Yes.

A trace of a grin shows on Cardenas' face.  He walks over to
the window and stares outside.  Reese, Troxell and McCurdy wait
as he thinks.  A beat.  Cardenas turns back to the room.

		CARDENAS
	What can we prove?

		MCCURDY
	We know Marsh had a head cold.   We
	found cocaine mixed with water in a
	nasal spray container on the
	nightstand.  The coke would contract
	the nasal membrane the same as any
	decongestant, but for a much shorter
	time.  He'd keep using more and more
	-- never knowing what he was taking.

		CARDENAS
	Any prints on the nasal spray?

		REESE
	Marsh's and Rebecca Lawson's.

		TROXELL
	What if he did know what was in it?
	A lot of users put it in nasal spray
	bottles so they can use it in public.

		MCCURDY
	Cocaine is the last thing a man in
	his condition would want.

		CARDENAS
	Can we put Rebecca Lawson at the
	scene?

								6


		REESE
	A man across the street from Marsh
	saw her drive up about four thirty
	Sunday afternoon.  And her prints are
	all over the place.

Cardenas stands and walks to a DART BOARD on the wall.  He
gathers the DARTS, moves back and tosses one.

		TROXELL
	Marsh's Cardiologist told me that
	after Marsh was diagnosed with heart
	disease he quit smoking, quit
	drinking and started exercising every
	day.  Does that sound like a guy
	who'd start shoveling cocaine up his
	nose?

		CARDENAS
	What did he say about Miss Lawson?

		TROXELL
	He can remember at least one occasion
	-- and the receptionist can recall
	two times when she accompanied Marsh
	to the office.

Cardenas throws another dart at the board.

		CARDENAS
	So she knew about his heart?

		TROXELL
	Had to.  I also interviewed three
	women who were in past relationships
	with Marsh.  There's no evidence that
	he had anything but straight sex
	prior to meeting Miss Lawson.

		CARDENAS
	What about the will?

		TROXELL
	That's the best part.  She gets it
	all -- everything.


EXT.  CEMETERY - MORNING

Gray clouds hang over head.  A light drizzle falls.  A GROUP of
MOURNERS hold umbrellas as they stand around the grave.

In the b.g. the PRESS is visible, held back my private SECURITY
GUARDS.

								7


A WOMAN dressed in BLACK stands in the front of the MOUNERS,
her face hidden behind a hat and veil.  RAYMOND SATTLER, a
tall, distinguished-looking man in his sixties stands beside
her.  He supports his weight with the aid of a CANE.  The
service concludes.  Sattler along with several other PEOPLE
offer her their condolences.  Joanne Braslow is there.  She
does not go over to Rebecca.

CARDENAS AND REESE stand off to the side by a large oak tree.
Cardenas watches and waits.  He steps forward as Sattler leads
the woman by.

		CARDENAS
	Miss Lawson?

The Woman stops.  Her back is to Cardenas.

		CARDENAS
	I'm District Attorney, John Cardenas.

REBECCA LAWSON removes her hat and veil and slowly turns
around.  She is in her late twenties.  A deep pain fills her
face -- controlled, but evident.  Her eyes are tired -- heavy
from crying -- but no tears show now.  This is a woman whose
grief is private and not displayed for others.  Although
emotionally drained she is still stunningly beautiful.  So
beautiful that even Cardenas' usually cool demeanor cannot hide
how impressed he is.

		SATTLER
	I don't think that this is the time,
	or the place.

		CARDENAS
	I just wanted to introduce myself and
	inform Miss Lawson that there will be
	an inquiry.

		SATTLER
	An inquiry into what?

		CARDENAS
	For starters I'd like to know why she
	left the house and didn't report the
	death?

		SATTLER
	Because he wasn't dead when she left,
	and even if he was, not reporting a
	natural death in a timely fashion
	isn't a crime.

		CARDENAS
	Did I say it was a natural death?

								8


Cardenas and Rebecca lock eyes.  Rebecca stares at him
genuinely shocked by his accusation.  Cardenas nods and walks
away.  In the b.g. we see Joanne staring at Rebecca with
hostility.


INT.  HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Large and homey.  A fire roars in the fireplace.  FRANK DULANEY
sits on his couch as he goes over some PAPERWORK.  He is mid-
thirties, powerful, self-assured.

SHARON DULANEY enters.  She is an attractive woman in her early
thirties.  She kisses him on the cheek then pushes his
PAPERWORK aside and sits down on his lap.

		SHARON
	You're on vacation, remember?  You're
	supposed to be relaxing.

		DULANEY
	I am relaxing.

		SHARON
		(pushing the papers
		 aside)
	This is not relaxing.

		DULANEY
		(playfully)
	Really?

		SHARON
	Really.

		DULANEY
		(playing along)
	And I suppose you're going to show me
	how to relax?

		SHARON
	If you want me to.

		DULANEY
	I'm always open to learning new
	things.

She kisses him -- soft, gentle kisses.  Dulaney puts his arms
around her and kisses her harder.

		DULANEY
	I'm beginning to see what you mean.
	Why don't we go upstairs and work on
	the advanced course?

								9


		SHARON
	I can't.  I've got to finish a
	counter offer on the Bergman
	property.

The moment is passing by.  A trace of frustration shows on
Dulaney's face -- this is obviously not a new occurrence.

		DULANEY
	Can't it wait?

		SHARON
	No -- it has to be done by tomorrow.

The moment is gone.  Dulaney forces an understanding smile.  He
looks towards the door and sees his EIGHT YEAR OLD SON,
MICHAEL.

		DULANEY
	Hey, Slugger.  Ready for bed?

Michael walks over to this parents.

		MICHAEL
	Uh huh.

The PHONE RINGS.  Dulaney answers it.

		DULANEY
		(into phone)
	Hello?... Hi Raymond.... What?...
	Well, I was sort of planning on...
	Alright... Okay, goodbye.
		(hangs up; to Sharon)
	That was Sattler.  He thinks the
	D.A.'s going to file on Rebecca
	Lawson.  He wants me in the office
	tomorrow morning.

		SHARON
	We're supposed to go to the lake.

		DULANEY
	I know.  What can I do?  He is the
	boss.

		SHARON
	He could let you have your vacation.

		MICHAEL
	Dad -- is it true what they're saying
	about that Miss Lawson Lady?


								10

		DULANEY
	What are they saying?

		MICHAEL
	The kids at school say she humped Mr.
	Marsh to death.

		DULANEY
	Hey, you know better than that.  What
	did I teach you to say when someone
	is accused of doing something?

		MICHAEL
	She allegedly humped him to death?

Dulaney grins.  Sharon is fighting the temptation to laugh.

		SHARON
	I swear -- the both of you.
		(to Dulaney)
	Some example you set.

		DULANEY
		(imitating her)
	Some example you set.

He makes a funny face at Michael who LAUGHS and makes one back.
Dulaney grabs him and starts TICKLING him.  Michael SCREAMS
with LAUGHTER as he tries to tickle him back.  Dulaney then
starts TICKLING SHARON -- Michael helps him.  Sharon ROARS with
LAUGHTER and falls to the floor.  The three of them roll around
LAUGHING hysterically.


INT.  SATTLER'S OFFICE - MORNING

Sattler sits on a couch sipping a cup of coffee.  Dulaney sits
across from him.

		DULANEY
	Andrew Marsh was a very wealthy man.
	A trial like this is going to put
	Cardenas in the spot-light.

		SATTLER
	We've already got press arriving from
	over the country and she hasn't even
	been charged yet.
	Cardenas wants to see her in his
	office tomorrow at ten.  I'd like you
	to go with her.

		DULANEY
	I'm supposed to be on vacation.


								11

		SATTLER
	I know -- but she wants you to
	represent her if Cardenas files.

		DULANEY
	Why?

		SATTLER
	Because I told her you were the best
	criminal attorney we have.

		DULANEY
	Raymond, I'm the only criminal
	attorney you have.

		SATTLER
		(jokingly)
	Well, I guess that makes you the
	best.
		(candidly)
	Look, Frank -- she stands to inherit
	three million dollars.  As executors
	of the estate and her attorneys that
	could generate a lot of legal fees
	for us.  All I'm asking you to do is
	talk to her.

Dulaney thinks about it for a moment.

		DULANEY
	Alright, I'll talk to her

		SATTLER
	She's waiting in the conference room.

Dulaney stands and walks towards the door.

		SATTLER
		(continuing)
	You know, I knew Andrew Marsh for
	almost twenty years -- or thought I
	did.  What do you think would make a
	man in his condition do the things he
	did?

Dulaney stops at the door and looks back.

		DULANEY
	I think the question is:  What is it
	about her that made him want to do
	it?



								12

INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Rebecca is seated at the end of the conference table smoking a
CIGARETTE.  Sunlight flows through a window and highlights her
hair.  She is dressed in a fashionable business suit that
clings to every curve of her body.

Dulaney enters the room.  When he sees her he can't help but
stare.  Rebecca notes his gaze.

		DULANEY
	Miss Lawson, I'm Frank Dulaney.

She raises the cigarette to her lips.  Dulaney notices despite
her outward composure her hand is shaking.

		REBECCA
		(nervously)
	Are you going to represent me?

		DULANEY
	There are no charges against you. I'm
	here to decide if I'm going to
	represent you should that occur.
		(beat)
	Did you kill him?

Rebecca appears hurt by the question.

		REBECCA
	You don't waste any time, do you?

Dulaney doesn't answer.  He studies her -- his eyes probing
hers.

		REBECCA
		(continuing)
	Do you think I did it?

		DULANEY
	I don't know.  That's why I'm asking
	you.

		REBECCA
	You must have some feeling.  Some
	immediate impression.  A young,
	attractive woman, involved with an
	older man who leaves her everything
	in his will.  And the things that
	went on in that house.  Such wild
	sex.  What kind of picture does that
	paint?

		DULANEY
	Not a very good one I'm afraid.

								13


		REBECCA
	And that's exactly what the jury will
	see when they look at me.  That's why
	I need a very good lawyer, Mr.
	Dulaney.

		DULANEY
	You're assuming the District Attorney
	is going to file charges.

Rebecca's anxiety begins to surface.  She feigns a weak smile.

		REBECCA
	He'll file.  He's an ambitious man.
	Ambitious men build their careers on
	the bodies of others.

		DULANEY
	You still haven't answered my
	question.

She takes a long drag of her cigarette before answering.  She
looks at Dulaney.  Displaying emotions is not something that
comes easily.  Tears well up in her eyes.

		REBECCA
		(emotionally)
	I loved him.  A big part of my life
	has been torn away from me, Mr.
	Dulaney.  A part I can never get back
	-- and on top of that people are
	saying that I am somehow responsible
	for it.  They've taken everything
	that is good and caring about two
	people in love and made it dirty.

A single tear streams down her check.  She knows what he wants
to hear her say -- and she resents having to say it.

		REBECCA
	No -- I didn't kill him.


INT.  HALLWAY, D.A.'S OFFICE - DAY

Cardenas walks down the hall, sipping a cup of coffee.  Troxell
walks towards him excitedly.  They walk together.

		TROXELL
	I think I'm going to make your day.

		CARDENAS
	How?


								14

Troxell points to an Office.  Through the glass partition we
can see a MAN sitting at a table.  ALAN PALEY is a well-groomed
man in his thirties who makes every effort to look good.

		TROXELL
	I've got this guy in my office.
	Doctor Alan Paley.  Wait until you
	hear what he has to say.

Cardenas and Troxell enters the room.  Cardenas shakes hands
with Paley and listens with great interest as he starts to
talk.


INT.  DULANEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Dulaney and Sharon are in bed.  Dulaney reads some PAPERS.
Sharon finishes reading her MAGAZINE.  She puts it on the
nightstand and looks at Dulaney.

		SHARON
	How can Cardenas possibly think he
	can build a case against two
	consenting adults?

		DULANEY
	He must have something or he wouldn't
	be pressing so hard.

		SHARON
	If he files are you going to take the
	case?

		DULANEY
	I don't know yet.  I want to hear
	what she says at her statement
	tomorrow.

		SHARON
	What's she like?

		DULANEY
	Attractive.  Bright.  Distant.
	Charming when she wants to be.

Dulaney's description seems to bother her.

		SHARON
	She sounds like quite a woman.

		DULANEY
		(joking)
	Yeah -- but can she cook?

Sharon hits him on the arm playfully.

								15


		SHARON
	The whole thing gives me the creeps.
	I mean -- what if she really humped
	him to death?

Dulaney grins at her choice of words.

		DULANEY
	Humped

		SHARON
		(grinning)
	Yes.

		DULANEY
	I can think of worse ways to go--

Dulaney rolls over, gathering her up in his arms.

		DULANEY
		(continuing)
	--and speaking of humping.

He reaches over to the nightstand and turns off the LIGHTS.


EXT.  CITY HALL BUILDING MORNING

As Dulaney and Rebecca walks up the steps they are engulfed by
a CROWD of REPORTERS.  Dulaney puts his arm around Rebecca and
ushers her through the crowd.


INT.  CARDENAS' OFFICE - MORNING

Dulaney and Rebecca sit on one side of a table.  Reese stands.
Cardenas sits at his desk.

		REBECCA
	I didn't know that Andrew was dead
	until Mr. Sattler called me at home
	that night.

		REESE
	We have a witness who saw you go into
	the house at four thirty.

		DULANEY
	She's not denying she was there.

		REESE
	Did you have sex?


								16

		REBECCA
	Yes.

		REESE
	What time did you leave?

		REBECCA
	Six thirty -- and he was very much
	alive.

		CARDENAS
	Miss Lawson, do you use cocaine?

		REBECCA
	I have.

		CARDENAS
	Did you use it the night Marsh died?

		REBECCA
	No.  I haven't done it in years.

		REESE
	Did Marsh use it?

		REBECCA
	No -- never.

		REESE
	It had to get there somehow.

		REBECCA
	It didn't get there from me.

		CARDENAS
	Were you aware of Mr. Marsh's heart
	condition?

		REBECCA
	No.

		CARDENAS
	Mr. Marsh's Cardiologist and his
	nurse have told us that you
	accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office
	on at least two occasions.

		REBECCA
	That's correct -- but Andrew never
	told me he had a heart condition.  He
	said he had a heart arrhythmia and it
	was nothing serious.

		REESE
	He never mentioned his heart disease?

								17


		DULANEY
	She just said that.

		REESE
	Why do you think he lied to you?

		DULANEY
	That's something only Marsh would
	know.

		REESE
	I think Miss Lawson knew it too.  I
	think she slipped him the coke and he
	popped his cork giving her the high-
	hard-one.

Dulaney's anger shows.  He stands.

		DULANEY
	That's it.  My client doesn't have to
	take this crap from you.

		CARDENAS
	Sit down, Frank.

		DULANEY
	No.  Miss Lawson came in here
	voluntarily to answer your questions.
	She doesn't have to sit here and be
	insulted.  So, either you charge her
	now or we're leaving.

A beat.  Dulaney and Cardenas lock eyes.  Cardenas shrugs his
shoulders.

		CARDENAS
	Fine.

Dulaney motions for Rebecca to get up.  She stands and they
walk to the door.  Reese looks at Cardenas.  Cardenas nods.

		REESE
	Rebecca Lawson, you're under arrest
	for the murder of Andrew Marsh.

Rebecca is stunned -- frightened.  She looks at Dulaney in
disbelief.  Dulaney looks at Cardenas angrily.  Reese removes
his handcuffs as he moves towards Rebecca.

		REESE
	You have the right to remain silent.
	If you give up--


								18

		CARDENAS
		(to Reese)
	I don't think the handcuffs will be
	necessary.  You can finish giving
	Miss Lawson her rights outside.

Reese grabs Rebecca by the arm and leads her to the door.  She
looks back at Frank, her face filled with fear -- her eyes
welling with tears.

		REBECCA
		(frightened)
	Frank!

		DULANEY
	I'll have you out in a few hours.

Reese ushers her through the door.  A beat.  Dulaney and
Cardenas are left alone.  Cardenas starts fishing through a can
of NUTS, carefully extracting the cashews.  Dulaney continues
to stand.

		DULANEY
	Lookin' to make the papers, John?

		CARDENAS
	Marsh left her close to three million
	dollars in his will.  That's motive.
	She admits to being there the night
	of his death.  That's opportunity --
	and her fingerprints are on the nasal
	spray bottle.

		DULANEY
		(continuing)
	You can't show intent.

Cardenas looks at Dulaney wryly.  He knows that Dulaney is
trying to discover his game plan.  Cardenas looks into his can
of nuts and fishes for another cashew.

		DULANEY
		(continuing)
	Can you?

		CARDENAS
	Take your pole out of the water,
	Frank.  The fish ain't biting today.

		DULANEY
	You're bluffing.  John, it's me,
	remember?  I've known you since your
	name was Juan Carlos.

Cardenas doesn't appreciate Dulaney mentioning his real name.

								19


		DULANEY
		(continuing)
	C'mon -- think about it.  If she was
	going to kill Marsh why leave the
	nasal spray bottle there for the
	police to find?

		CARDENAS
	She planned this.  She wanted us to
	find the nasal spray.

		DULANEY
	Why would she want that?

		CARDENAS
	Because she's clever.  Because she
	knows that even if we didn't find it
	we'd have suspicions as to why a man
	in Marsh's condition would use
	cocaine.

		DULANEY
	Suspicions maybe -- but suspicions
	aren't enough for a conviction.

		CARDENAS
	The M.E.'s report stated that Marsh's
	nasal membranes showed no sign of
	prior cocaine use.  Without the nasal
	spray we would have still treated it
	as a poisoning.  We would have looked
	for motive and the trail would have
	still led back to her.

		DULANEY
	I don't buy it and neither will a
	jury.

		CARDENAS
	We're going all the way on this one,
	Frank.  Tell your client she has
	until the prelim to cop a plea for
	murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.

		DULANEY
	I'll tell her but she won't take it.

		CARDENAS
	Then she's not as smart as I thought
	she was.  You've seen her in the
	depositions.  Tell me you don't have
	any doubts?


								20

		DULANEY
	She's innocent.

		CARDENAS
	Aren't they all?

		DULANEY
	Yeah.  Well -- we'll let the
	blindfolded lady with the scales
	decide that.

Dulaney gets up slowly and leaves.


INT.  CITY JAIL, BOOKING COUNTER - AFTERNOON

Dulaney waits at the counter.  A barred door slides open and
Rebecca is led out by a WOMAN JAILER.  Even in these
surroundings she maintains her composure.  She walks to the
counter and waits silently.


EXT.  CITY HALL BUILDING - AFTERNOON

As Dulaney and Rebecca leave they are once again encircled by
REPORTERS, screaming questions, asking them to verify Rebecca's
arrest.  Dulaney plows through the crowd with Rebecca in tow.


EXT.  RIVER - AFTERNOON

Gray clouds hang overhead, threatening rain.  Tall birch trees
line the river, the color of their leaves hinting that autumn
is approaching.  Dulaney and Rebecca walk along a jogging path
cut along the bank.

		DULANEY
	I want you to know right now that the
	trial's going to be nasty.  Your sex
	life is going to be dragged through
	the mud.  They're going to say that
	you enticed Marsh -- led him down a
	dark path.

		REBECCA
	Andrew hardly needed leading.  He was
	a very passionate man.  He was eager
	to explore.  I gave him what he
	wanted.  We fulfilled each others
	needs.

		DULANEY
	This is a very small town -- people
	here have very straight views on sex.


								21

		REBECCA
	I'm used to being on the outside
	looking in.  The same men who will
	publicly profess their moral outrage
	for my sexual tastes are the same
	ones who privately rest their sweaty
	little hands on my legs and talk
	about weekend trips together.

		DULANEY
	Those same men will be sitting on the
	jury.

		REBECCA
	I am who I am.  I can't deny it,
	anymore than you can deny who you
	are.  I like sex different -- I like
	it wild.  That's not a crime.
		(emotional)
	I loved Andrew.  We made love
	together.  We made it differently,
	but we still made love.  It was our
	way.  It was private -- and now the
	whole world wants to look in through
	the pretense of justice.  If I was
	some middle-aged divorcee who screwed
	him once a week do you think this
	would be happening to me?

She stops walking and stares out over the River.

		REBECCA
	Have you ever seen animals make love,
	Mr. Dulaney?  They have such passion
	-- such savage emotion.  They
	struggle, and snarl, and claw, but
	neither hurts the other.  Not really.

		DULANEY
	No pain, no gain?

		REBECCA
	Something like that.

		DULANEY
	We're not animals.

As Rebecca speaks, Dulaney seems captivated.


								22

		REBECCA
	Of course we are.  Our primal urges
	are still there -- but we've taken
	sex and intellectualized it, refined
	it down to its most essential
	components.  It's bland, easy,
	mechanical.  There's great passion in
	the struggle -- such craving in
	denial.  Do you know what it's like
	to yearn for something?  I'm not
	talking about wanting, or needing.
	I'm talking about an urge so deep
	that your skin burns and every cell
	in your body pulses with desire?

Dulaney appears moved by the passion of her words -- but he's
uncomfortable by it and quickly pushes it aside.

		DULANEY
		(awkwardly)
	I think we're getting a little off
	the subject here.

		REBECCA
	I thought the subject was sex?

		DULANEY
	As it pertains to you -- not me.
		(beat)
	Did you always know you had
	different... tastes?

		REBECCA
	Yes.

		DULANEY
	How?

		REBECCA
	I don't know if it's something I can
	explain to you.

		DULANEY
	Why not?

		REBECCA
	Because -- it's beyond intellect.
	It's emotion.  It's passion.  It has
	to be experienced -- it can't be
	imagined.

		DULANEY
	Try.

Rebecca thinks for a moment.

								23


		REBECCA
	When I was growing up we had a
	strawberry patch in our backyard. So
	did this family down the road.  I
	used to sneak in their yard and steal
	their strawberries.  It wasn't easy.
	The stone walls were high and I'd
	scrape my knees as I climbed over.
	On the other side were wild rose
	bushes.  The thorns would dig into my
	legs and cut my thighs as I lowered
	myself down.

		DULANEY
	If you had what you wanted at home
	why did you sneak into their yard?

		REBECCA
	Because -- somehow the fruit always
	tasted that much sweeter because of
	the pain it took to get to it.

Dulaney appears lost in her words.  This isn't lost on Rebecca.
She walks off.  Dulaney stares after her intrigued.


INT.  DULANEY'S HOUSE, DINING ROOM - EVENING

A light rain falls outside.  Dulaney picks at his food.  He
stares out the window.  He seems oblivious to the conversation
between Sharon and Michael.

		MICHAEL
	Albert's got the stomach flu.

		SHARON
	That's too bad.

		MICHAEL
	No, it's not.  Now I get to pitch.

		SHARON
	Michael, you shouldn't be happy when
	someone else isn't feeling well.

		MICHAEL
	Not even if they're a dork?

		SHARON
	Not even if they're a dork.  You
	should go by and see how he's
	feeling.


								24

		MICHAEL
	No way.  Jerry Milner stopped by and
	Albert puked right in front of him.

Sharon tries to suppress a grin.

		SHARON
	Don't use language like that at the
	dinner table.

		MICHAEL
	Sorry.

Sharon looks at Dulaney.  He is still staring out the window,
deep in thought.


INT.  DEN - EVENING

Dulaney is at his desk, looking at PHOTOGRAPHS of Marsh and the
bedroom.  Sharon enters.

		SHARON
	Frank -- I know you're busy, but
	Michael asked me after dinner if you
	were angry with him.  He wanted to
	know why you weren't talking to him.

		DULANEY
	I'll talk to him later.

		SHARON
	Why don't you talk to him now?

		DULANEY
	Because I go to trial in seven weeks.
	I've got a lot of preparing to do.

		SHARON
		(angry)
	No one's asking you not to work.  I
	just think you could make some time
	for your son.


INT.  MICHAEL'S BEDROOM - EVENING

Michael lies on his bed, doing his homework.  The door opens
and Dulaney enters and sits beside him.

		DULANEY
	I'm sorry if it looks like I'm not
	paying attention to you lately.


								25

Michael looks at Dulaney somewhat confused.  Dulaney tries to
explain it another way.

		DULANEY
		(continuing)
	You know how it is sometimes when
	you're out playing ball with your
	friends?  How you're really
	concentrating on what you're doing --
	and you lose track of time and you
	come home late and Mom yells at you?

		MICHAEL
	Yeah.

		DULANEY
	Well, that's kind of how I am right
	now.

		MICHAEL
	Is Mom yelling at you too?

Dulaney grins.

		DULANEY
	Yeah -- a little.

Dulaney leans over and hugs Michael.

		DULANEY
	I love you.

		MICHAEL
	I love you too, Dad.


INT.  DULANEY'S OFFICE - MORNING

CHARLIE BIGGS is a tall, wiry black man.  Street-wise, but
basically good humored.  He is tossing a NERF BALL through a
basketball hoop mounted on the wall as Dulaney enters.

		BIGGS
	How you doin' Mister D?

		DULANEY
	Fine, Charlie.  You familiar with the
	Marsh case?


								26

		BIGGS
	Yeah -- I hear they had 'em a real
	dog and pony show going on up there -
	-  I'll tell you, sometimes white
	people are a real puzzle to me.  I
	mean, did this old guy really think
	he was gonna be able to keep up with
	a sweet little number like that?

		DULANEY
	It could've happened to anyone.

		BIGGS
		(ghetto accent)
	I'm sorry, man -- but I ain't ever
	heard of no brother dying from
	gettin' too much pussy.

Dulaney grins in spite of himself.

		DULANEY
	We have to find out who else would
	profit from Marsh's death -- and who
	knew enough about his personal life
	to know that putting cocaine in the
	nasal spray would be fatal.

		BIGGS
	So -- where do we start?

		DULANEY
	I want you to hit all the dealers in
	town.  Give them a list of people
	close to Marsh and see if any of them
	use.  Then I want you to check out a
	Doctor Alan Paley.  He lives up in
	Roseburg.

Dulaney's SECRETARY'S VOICE crackles over the intercom.

		SECRETARY (VO)
	Mister Dulaney, I have Rebecca Lawson
	on one.

Dulaney picks up the phone.

		DULANEY
		(on the phone)
	Hi... No, I don't... One o'clock is
	fine... Alright La Brasa... Bye.

Dulaney hangs up.  Biggs is staring at him with a grin.

		BIGGS
	La Brasa?

								27


		DULANEY
		(defensive)
	I'm taking a client to lunch.  Where
	should I go, Taco Bell?

Biggs tosses the ball to Dulaney, then raises his hands
indicating he is backing off.  He leaves.  Dulaney shoots from
his desk.  SWOOSH!


INT.  RESTAURANT - DAY

Dimly lit.  Dark wood and leather.  Dulaney sits at a table
with Rebecca.  She removes a CIGARETTE and holds it, waiting
for Dulaney to light it.  Dulaney fumbles through his pockets
and removes a book of MATCHES.  He lights one.  Rebecca doesn't
lean forward to meet him.  He must go to her.  She looks into
his eyes as she cups her hand over his.  A beat.  She lights
the cigarette and takes a drag, then arches her neck back and
blows a stream of smoke towards the ceiling.  SHE DOES NOT BLOW
OUT THE MATCH OR REMOVE HER HAND FROM DULANEY'S.  She watches
him as it burns down towards his fingers.  After a long moment
she leans in and sensually blows out the match and releases his
hand.

		DULANEY
	How'd you meet Marsh?

		REBECCA
	I was at a cocktail party.  Very
	trendy.  Andrew was in Chicago on
	business.  He had broken his wrist
	the week before and was wearing it in
	a sling.  He looked so helpless.

A FOURSOME a few tables away are staring at her.  Rebecca sees
them.

		DULANEY
	-- And then?

		REBECCA
	We started talking.  In fact, we
	talked until four in the morning.  We
	discovered we shared a lot of the
	same interests.  After that we were
	together all the time until he left.
	He used to call me every night after
	he came back.  Then after a few weeks
	he invited me to come visit him.
	I've never left.

		DULANEY
	Why didn't you live together?

								28


		REBECCA
	Andrew was worried about how it would
	look.

A COUPLE in a booth are looking at Rebecca and whispering.
Rebecca and Dulaney notice them.

		REBECCA
	Can we get out of here?

		DULANEY
	Sure.  Where to?

Rebecca stands up.  She doesn't answer.  She just walks off.


EXT.  REBECCA'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

Dulaney pulls up in his car behind Rebecca's.  They get out.
Dulaney follows her as she walks to the door.

		DULANEY
	This is your house.

		REBECCA
		(walking towards the
		 door)
	I know.

Dulaney stops.

		DULANEY
	I don't think this is a good idea.

Rebecca stops and turns towards him.

		REBECCA
	Why not?

		DULANEY
	Because, I'm your attorney.  I
	shouldn't be going to your house.

		REBECCA
	Is it against the law?

		DULANEY
	No -- it just doesn't look right.

Rebecca stares at him for a moment, then looks down the street
to her left and back to her right, then back at Dulaney.

		REBECCA
	No one's looking.

								29


She walks to her front door and opens it.  She enters, leaving
the door open.  Dulaney waits for a moment, then follows.


INT.  REBECCA'S, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

Dulaney enters.  Rebecca is standing in the middle of the room.
Her back is to Dulaney, but she knows he is there.  Dulaney
looks around the room.  He stares at a group of PHOTOGRAPHS on
the wall.  On the other WALL is a GIANT TELEVISION SCREEN.

DULANEY'S POV - OF THE WALL

filled with EROTIC PAINTINGS AND PHOTOGRAPHS -- sensual but not
vulgar.

Rebecca walks over and stands very close to him as he studies
the artwork.

		REBECCA
	What do you think?

		DULANEY
	I think the photographer's probably a
	voyeur.

		REBECCA
	I'm the photographer.

		DULANEY
	Oh -- Well, they're different.

		REBECCA
	That's not an answer.

		DULANEY
	It's not my taste.

		REBECCA
		(seductively)
	Tastes can change.

Rebecca looks up to the top of a high cabinet.  Sitting on top
of the cabinet is a WHITE PERSIAN CAT.

		REBECCA
	There you are.

She stands on her tip toes as she reaches up.  Dulaney watches
her -- the arch of her back -- the hem of her skirt rising up
her legs.  She lowers the cat down and walks to a chair and
sits down.  The slit of her dress opens revealing her thighs.
Dulaney's eyes trace along them.  Rebecca notes his gaze.


								30

		REBECCA
	What are you thinking?

Dulaney looks up quickly.

		DULANEY
	Nothing.

		REBECCA
	Not true.  Shall I tell you what you
	were thinking?  You were wondering if
	I was wearing anything under my
	skirt.

The fact that he doesn't protest confirms that she is right.
She runs her finger lightly along her thighs.

		REBECCA
	I am.

Dulaney walks to the window and stares out.  Rebecca seems
amused.  She puts the cat down and walks over to him.

		REBECCA
	Sorry.  I wasn't trying to embarrass
	you.

He slowly turns towards her.

		DULANEY
	Yes you were.

Dulaney stares at her for a moment, then places his briefcase
on the table and opens it.


INT.  RESTAURANT - CLOSE ON STRAWBERRIES - NIGHT

A fork digs into a large strawberry.  PULL BACK as we follow
the strawberry into Sharon's mouth.

Dulaney sits across from Sharon.  His eyes are on the
strawberries.  His mind is someplace else -- and it isn't hard
to guess where.

		SHARON
	--he said it might be too expensive
	to add another room.  He suggested we
	might convert the garage into a guest
	room.  He's going to check with the
	contractor and let me know.  I'll let
	you know how much and we can decide.
	Alright?


								31

Dulaney looks up slowly.  It is not so much that he has heard
the question -- it is more that he is aware that Sharon has
stopped talking.  A beat.  Sharon isn't sure he has heard her.

		SHARON
	Is that alright, Frank?

		DULANEY
	Yeah -- fine.  Excuse me.  I'll be
	right back.

He stands and leaves the table.


INT.  RESTAURANT, HALLWAY - NIGHT

Dulaney walks to a PAY PHONE near the bathrooms.  He thinks for
a moment, then dials a number.  Rebecca answers.

		REBECCA (VO)
	Hello?

		DULANEY
	Hi.  It's Frank.

		REBECCA (VO)
	Hi, Frank.

		DULANEY
		(awkwardly)
	I just wanted to see if my secretary
	called to confirm your appointment
	tomorrow.

		REBECCA (VO)
	Yes -- she did.

		DULANEY
	Great.  I'll see you at the office at
	nine.

		REBECCA (VO)
	No -- not at the office.  I've got a
	better idea.


EXT.  CABIN, KLAMATH LAKE - AFTERNOON

An old wood cabin set on the shore of the lake.  Dulaney and
Rebecca get out of the car and walk towards it.

		REBECCA
	I figured if we have to talk all day
	we might as well do it someplace
	nice.

								32

		(looks at the cabin)
	Isn't it beautiful?

		DULANEY
	Yeah.

		REBECCA
		(sadly)
	Andrew loved this old cabin.
		(fondly remembering)
	He always dreamed about moving to
	Tahiti -- living in a hut and
	becoming a beach-bum.
		(a sad smile)
	I could never imagine myself doing
	that -- but somehow when he talked
	about it, he made it sound so alive -
	- so wonderful.  Soft ocean breezes
	and beautiful sunsets -- leaving the
	world and it's problems behind.  I
	wish he'd had a chance to do it.

Her mind drifts away for a moment, locked on some distant
memory.

		REBECCA
		(snapping out of it)
	Sorry.

		DULANEY
	It's okay.


EXT.  LAKE, FURTHER - DUSK

Dulaney and Rebecca walk along the shore.  A soft wind blows
through her hair.

		DULANEY
	Tell me about Doctor Paley?

		REBECCA
	I hardly know him.  He wanted me and
	he couldn't have me.

		DULANEY
	It's going to be hard to convince a
	jury that he's testifying against you
	in a murder trial because you blew
	him off.

		REBECCA
		(confidently)
	It won't be that hard.


								33

She walks off.


EXT.  CABIN - DUSK

Dulaney and Rebecca sit on an old porch swing.

		REBECCA
	Did you always want to be a lawyer?

		DULANEY
	No -- I wanted to be a professional
	hockey player.

		REBECCA
	Really?

		DULANEY
	Yeah.

		REBECCA
	That seems so far away from who you
	are now.  What happened?

		DULANEY
	I broke my ankle skating.  That ended
	that dream.

		REBECCA
	It's hard to let go of a dream, isn't
	it?  To let go of what you want?

Dulaney stares at her -- she looks beautiful in the warm light
of the setting sun.  Their eyes meet.  He starts to lean in
towards her -- then stops.  He gets up and walks away.


EXT.  REBECCA'S HOUSE - EVENING

Rebecca's car pulls up in front.  Dulaney gets out.

		REBECCA
	I'm going to put the car away.  You
	can let yourself in.  There's a key
	under the flower pot.

Rebecca drives to the rear of the building.  Dulaney walks to
the door.  He lifts the FLOWER POT -- removes a KEY -- opens
the door and goes inside.

ANGLE - DOWN THE STREET

Detective Reese is parked in his car, watching the house.  He
glances at his watch, then makes a note in his note pad.


								34


INT.  REBECCA'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING

Rebecca walks over to the STEREO and turns on the CASSETTE
PLAYER.  The room fills with soft, sexy MUSIC.  Dulaney stands
in the middle of the room -- his eyes following her every move.

		REBECCA
	Yes -- it would be nice.

		DULANEY
	What would?

		REBECCA
	You and me -- making love.

		DULANEY
	Is that what you think I was
	thinking?

		REBECCA
	No -- that's what I know you were
	thinking.

Before Dulaney can start to protest she continues.  She slowly
walks behind him.  Dulaney stares straight ahead.

		REBECCA
	How often do you make love to your
	wife, Frank?  Once a week?  Sometimes
	twice?  There once was passion,
	wasn't there?  But now it's bland,
	predictable.  Tell me, when you do it
	-- do you always think of her?  Or do
	you wonder what it would be like to
	be with someone else?  Someone wild.
	Someone who would force you to lose
	control.

Her words strip his thoughts bare.  He is vulnerable.

		REBECCA
		(continuing)
	There's nothing wrong in admitting
	that you want me, Frank.

		DULANEY
	You take a lot for granted.

Dulaney starts for the door.  Rebecca's cool exterior fades,
giving way to her vulnerable side.


								35

		REBECCA
	Please stay, Frank.  I don't want to
	be alone.  I don't expect anything
	from you -- no demands -- no
	complications.  I just need to feel
	close to someone.

Dulaney turns back towards her.  A beat.  He thinks for a
moment, then walks back into the room.  Rebecca smiles warmly,
invitingly.

		REBECCA
	I'll be back in a minute.  Help
	yourself to a drink.

She disappears down the hall.  Dulaney stands were he is,
wondering what he is doing there.  He walks over to the BAR and
pours a SCOTCH.  He looks down the hall.

HIS POV - REBECCA'S BEDROOM

The bedroom door is open.  The room is DARK -- Lit only by the
moon.  Rebecca slowly pulls her sweater off over her head.
MOONLIGHT washes over her body, SILHOUETTING her.  She runs her
hands lightly over her stomach -- working her way up to her
round, full breasts.  She stops for a moment -- and we sense
she knows Dulaney is watching her.

Dulaney stares at her -- mesmerized.  He knows he should turn
away, but he cannot control the urge that moves him to look.

One by one Rebecca unsnaps the buttons of her jeans, revealing
her sheer, white panties.  She bends forward slightly and
slowly peels the jeans down to her ankles -- then steps out of
them.

We can see the desire on Dulaney's face.  He looks away.  The
conflict inside him grows.  He looks back.

Rebecca walks into the hall.  She is barefoot --  wearing a
long, slinky dress -- her eyes catch Dulaney's.  If she wasn't
aware he was watching her before -- she is now.  It doesn't
seem to bother her.  She moves towards him slowly -- her eyes
inviting his.

Dulaney moves towards her.  They meet in the middle of the
room.  She waits -- he moves closer -- so close that he can
smell her.  She cranes her neck back, subtly tempting him to
bring his lips to hers.  The longing overcomes him.  He kisses
her lightly -- the kiss lingers for a moment, then she grabs
him forcefully by the hair, arching his head back.  She bites
his lip.


								36

		REBECCA
		(whispering)
	My way.

Dulaney ignores her.  He tries to kiss her again.  She turns
her head away.

She walks down the hall into the bedroom and closes the door.
Dulaney follows.  He tries the door -- it's locked.  He starts
to knock -- stops -- turns and walks back into the living room.
He starts to leave -- stops.  He looks at the bedroom door.
His passion builds -- his hunger for her devours him.  He moves
quickly down the hall -- eyes filled with determination.  He
breaks the door open with his shoulder.

Rebecca is standing in the center of the room -- as if waiting
for him.  He moves to her.  She can see the fire in his eyes.
He takes her in his arms -- kisses her neck feverishly --
feeding his craving for her.

		REBECCA
	My way.

He is lost within her now and doesn't hear her.  She pulls his
hair, jerking his head back.  Her eyes command him to follow
her demand.

Something in him snaps -- a new door opens.  He pushes her back
onto the DRESSING CABINET.  He kisses her, running his hand up
her thighs, hiking up her dress.  She wraps her legs around his
waist.  They move along the cabinet -- knocking jars and
bottles to the floor.  He lifts her -- carries her to the bed -
- lays her down and rips her dress from her body.  Their
passion is unleased.  They grope and claw for one another
hungrily.  She pulls his shirt off and bites him on the
shoulder.  His face tenses from the pain, but he MOANS with
pleasure.


INT.  DULANEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Dark.  Sharon is asleep.  The door opens and Dulaney enters
quietly.  He walks towards the bathroom.


INT.  DULANEY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

Dulaney splashes a handful of water across his face.  He
unbuttons his shirt and takes it off -- wincing as he does.  He
turns his back to the mirror.  Several deep FINGERNAIL SCRAPES
are dug into his back.  He looks at himself in the mirror.



								37

INT.  HALLWAY, LAW OFFICES - MORNING

Dulaney and Biggs walk down the hall to a water cooler.  Biggs
pours himself a glass.

		BIGGS
	Before you ask there's nothing new on
	the coke.

		DULANEY
	You've got to get me something I can
	use, Charlie.

		BIGGS
	I'm trying.

Sattler walks over with another MAN.  He ignores Biggs.

		SATTLER
	Frank -- this is Harvey Willows from
	the L.A. Times.  He'd like to ask you
	a few questions.

		MAN
	It's an incredible story going on
	here.
		(as if quoting a
		 headline)
	Woman accused of using sex to kill
	lover.

		BIGGS
	I'll say -- it's gonna give a whole
	new meaning to the state nickname.

Biggs LAUGHS and walks off.  Sattler glares at him.  Dulaney
smirks.

		MAN
		(confused)
	What's the state nickname?

		DULANEY
		(dryly)
	The Beaver State.


EXT.  RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY

Rows of new Town Houses line the street.  Dulaney drives up and
walks towards the front door of one of them.  He KNOCKS.
JOANNE BRASLOW answers.  She stares at Dulaney innocently.



								38

INT.  JOANNE'S TOWN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Sparsely decorated.  Very trendy.  High tech furniture and
designer lights.  Joanne sits on the couch -- Dulaney on one of
the chairs.  There is COFFEE on the table.

		JOANNE
	I worked for Mr. Marsh for six years.
	He was a good man -- until she came
	along.

		DULANEY
	What changed?

		JOANNE
	He did.  Look, I know you can lead a
	horse to water but you can't make him
	drink -- but you hold a pail of water
	in front of an old horse for long
	enough  -- and well...

Joanne stops as emotion fills her.  Her eyes well with tears.

		DULANEY
	You don't really believe what the
	district attorney is saying about
	Miss Lawson, do you?

		JOANNE
	I don't know.  It's incredible to
	think that anyone could be capable of
	doing that -- but if anyone could it
	would be Rebecca.

		DULANEY
	I take it you don't like Miss Lawson
	very much?

		JOANNE
	I really don't know her that well.
	We would say hello to each other when
	I would come to the house, but that
	was about it.

		DULANEY
	If you don't know her that well what
	makes you think she's capable of
	murder?

		JOANNE
	Andrew was a kind and gentle man, but
	he was thirty years older than her.
	Where's the attraction to sleep with
	someone like that -- to have the kind
	of sex they had.

								39


		DULANEY
	How do you know what kind of sex they
	had?

		JOANNE
	I wasn't lookin' through the keyhole
	if that's what you're thinking.  I'd
	come to house sometimes to pick up
	papers or speak to Andrew.  I'd find
	their little toys all over the place.

		DULANEY
	Did Mr. Marsh use drugs?

		JOANNE
	No.

		DULANEY
	What about Miss Lawson?

		JOANNE
	Yes -- cocaine.

Dulaney is shocked by this.

		DULANEY
	How do you know that?

		JOANNE
	I was at the house one morning -- I
	thought Miss Lawson was upstairs with
	Mr. Marsh.  When I went into the
	guest bathroom she was standing in
	front of the mirror pouring this
	white powder out of a vial.

Dulaney looks like he's been kicked in the stomach.

		JOANNE
	Is something wrong.

A beat.  Dulaney looks at her slowly.
		DULANEY
	What?  No -- nothing.  Thank you for
	your time.

He gets up and walks to the door.  Joanne stands and stares
after him with a trace of a grin.


INT.  REBECCA'S HOUSE - DAY

Rebecca opens the front door and Dulaney barges into the room.

								40


		DULANEY
	You lied to me!

		REBECCA
	What?

		DULANEY
	I just left Joanne Braslow.  She told
	me she saw you doing cocaine at
	Marsh's house!

		REBECCA
	She's mistaken.

		DULANEY
		(Yelling)
	That's not good enough, Goddamit!

		REBECCA
	It isn't true.  You have to believe
	me.

		DULANEY
	No, I don't have to believe you.  The
	jury has to believe you and answers
	like he's lying or she's mistaken
	aren't going to convince them.

		REBECCA
	I don't use cocaine anymore.  If she
	says she saw me doing it she's lying.

		DULANEY
	Why would she lie?

		REBECCA
	I don't know, Frank -- but don't you
	think that's something we should find
	out?

Dulaney is confused, struggling to decide if he believes her.


INT.  LAUNDRY ROOM, DULANEY HOUSE - DAY

Sharon is getting a load of washing ready.  She picks up one of
Dulaney's tee shirts and notices several thin stripes of BLOOD
near the shoulder.


INT.  DULANEY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

RAIN falls.  Dulaney enters the room to find Michael on the
PHONE.  Dulaney appears nervous -- anxious.

								41


		DULANEY
	Michael -- get off the phone.

		MICHAEL
	Why?

		DULANEY
		(impatiently)
	Because I'm expecting a call.

		MICHAEL
	-- But it's Sunday.

		DULANEY
		(snapping)
	I know what day it is!  Get off the
	phone.

		MICHAEL
		(hurt; into phone)
	I gotta go.  I'll call you later.

Michael hangs up and leaves the room.  Dulaney stares at the
phone -- struggling against himself.  He picks it up and dials.

		REBECCA'S VOICE
	This is Rebecca Lawson.  I'm not in
	right now.  So if you please leave a
	message--

Dulaney slams down the phone.  He checks his watch.


INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

Dulaney wears another tee shirt as he sleeps.  Sharon is awake,
staring up at the ceiling.  A beat.  She rolls over and
carefully lifts up Dulaney's tee shirt.  She sees the scratches
on his back.  She does not wake him.  She just lays there, deep
in thought.


INT.  HALLWAY, COURTHOUSE - MORNING

Rebecca walks down the hall.  In the b.g. we see Dulaney
walking quickly to join her.

		DULANEY
	I called you all weekend.  Where were
	you?

		REBECCA
	I went out on the boat.


								42

		DULANEY
		(concerned)
	Alone?

		REBECCA
	Of course.


INT.  COURTROOM - MORNING

The gallery is crowded with REPORTERS and SPECTATORS.  Dulaney
sits beside Rebecca at the defense table.  Cardenas stands
before the jury.

Dulaney and Cardenas are seated at their respective tables.
Rebecca sits beside Dulaney.  She is wearing a beautiful, well
tailored dress.  She looks beautiful and has surprisingly made
no attempt to down-play her looks.

JUDGE BURNHAM, a confident BLACK MAN in his fifties sits behind
the bench.  He is strong-willed -- tough but fair.  There is a
rough edge to him from his childhood on the streets.


		JUDGE BURNHAM
	This trial by its very nature is
	explosive.  The press is going to
	have a field day and I will not
	tolerate any activity in my courtroom
	that will fuel it.
		(to Dulaney and
		 Cardenas)
	Both of you are going to be delving
	into very personal aspects of peoples
	lives.  I warn you now.  When you do
	so -- if you cannot establish a clear
	line of relevancy early on in your
	examinations I will stop you.  Is
	that clear?

Dulaney and Cardenas both nod.

		JUDGE BURNHAM
	Mr. Cardenas.

Cardenas stands and walks towards the JURY.

		CARDENAS
		(points to Rebecca)
	You all can see the defendant,
	Rebecca Lawson.  But as this trial
	proceeds you will see that she is not
	only the defendant -- she is the
	murder weapon itself.

								43

		(stops and thinks for
		 a moment)
	Is that possible?  Can a person
	actually be a weapon?  The answer is
	yes.  If I hit you and you die -- I
	am the cause of your death.  But can
	sex be called a weapon?  Yes.  And
	what a deadly weapon Rebecca Lawson
	made of it.  The State will prove
	that Miss Lawson seduced Andrew Marsh
	-- that she put increasing sexual
	demands on him while she secretly
	administered cocaine.  All the while
	knowing that he had a severe heart
	condition.
		(beat)
	She is a beautiful woman -- but when
	this trial is over you will see her
	no differently than a gun, or a knife
	or any other instrument used as a
	weapon.  She is a killer.  And the
	worst kind -- one who disguised
	herself as a loving partner.

Cardenas walks back to the prosecution table and sits down.

		JUDGE BURNHAM
	Mr. Dulaney?

Dulaney stands up and approaches the jury.

		DULANEY
	I know what you're thinking -- and
	it's a mistake.  You look at Miss
	Lawson and you see a beautiful woman
	who was involved with an older man --
	and you think she looks like the
	type.  She could've done it.  And
	that's exactly what the District
	Attorney wants you to think.  Yes,
	she is beautiful.  So what?  Does
	that make her a killer?  Of course
	not.  This case is not about
	appearances.  It's about facts.
		(beat)
	As Mr. Cardenas presents his case you
	will see that there are very few
	facts -- that the bulk of the States
	evidence is circumstantial.  I'm
	confident that by the conclusion of
	this trial you will not just have a
	reasonable doubt.  You will have no
	doubt at all --  that Rebecca Lawson
	is innocent of the charges against
	her.

								44



INT.  COURTROOM - LATER - DAY

McCurdy is on the witness stand.  Cardenas stands before him.

		CARDENAS
	Doctor McCurdy, what was the cause of
	death?

		MCCURDY
	A massive cardiac arrest.

		CARDENAS
	What was Mr. Marsh's physical
	condition prior to his death?

		MCCURDY
	Very poor.  He was suffering from
	severe arterial disease.

		CARDENAS
	Was the heart attack the result of
	natural causes?

		MCCURDY
	No.

		CARDENAS
	What induced it?

		MCCURDY
	We found a high concentration of
	cocaine in his blood.

		CARDENAS
	So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?

		MCCURDY
	I don't think so.  The membrane in
	his nasal passage didn't show any
	sign of long time usage.

		CARDENAS
	Then how did it get into his body?

		MCCURDY
	We found a bottle of Dristan nasal
	spray on the nightstand.  It was
	filled with water and cocaine.  Mr.
	Marsh had a head cold at the time of
	his death.  I believe he wasn't aware
	that he was ingesting cocaine.


								45

Cardenas holds up a bottle of NASAL SPRAY in a PLASTIC BAG.  He
brings it over to McCurdy.

		CARDENAS
	Is this the bottle that was found on
	the nightstand?

		MCCURDY
		(examines it)
	Yes.

		CARDENAS
	Your Honor, the State enters this
	evidence as exhibit A.
		(to McCurdy)
	Were any fingerprints found on the
	bottle?

		MCCURDY
	Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb
	print of Miss Lawson's.

		CARDENAS
	Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to
	someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?

		MCCURDY
	Increase his heart rate.

		CARDENAS
	-- And if he were in the midst of
	making love while under the influence
	of cocaine?

		MCCURDY
	It would be an added stress to his
	heart.

		CARDENAS
	What would be the effect if someone
	secretly administered cocaine to Mr.
	Marsh and then induced him to make
	love?

		MCCURDY
	It would be the same as shooting a
	gun at him.

		CARDENAS
	Thank you, Doctor McCurdy.
		(to Dulaney)
	Your witness.


								46

Rebecca looks at Dulaney for his opinion of McCurdy's
testimony.  Dulaney gives her a reassuring glance before he
stands up and approaches McCurdy.

		DULANEY
	Can you say with any certainty that
	Mr. Marsh didn't ingest the cocaine
	himself?

		MCCURDY
	No -- but it seems highly unlikely
	that a man in his condition would use
	cocaine.

		DULANEY
	That's your opinion, Doctor -- but
	I'm asking you if there is any
	scientific test that can tell who
	actually put the cocaine into the
	Dristan bottle?

		MCCURDY
	No.

		DULANEY
	Thank you.


INT.  COURTROOM - LATER - DAY

Cardenas stands before DOCTOR TRAMMEL, a thin, pasty-faced man
in his fifties.

		CARDENAS
	Doctor Trammel, when did you first
	diagnose that Mr. Marsh had heart
	disease?

		DR. TRAMMEL
	About a year and half ago.

		CARDENAS
	Did Mr. Marsh change his lifestyle
	after that?

		DR. TRAMMEL
	Yes -- he stopped smoking and
	drinking and exercised regularly.

		CARDENAS
	He did everything he could to take
	care of his heart?

		DR. TRAMMEL
	Yes.

								47


		CARDENAS
	Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr.
	Marsh to your office?

		DR. TRAMMEL
	Yes.

		CARDENAS
	Just one last question.  What does
	the sign on your office door say?

		DR. TRAMMEL
	Doctor Steven Trammel.  Cardiologist.

Cardenas walks back to his seat, signaling his examination of
the witness is over.  Dulaney stands.

		DULANEY
	Dr. Trammel, did you ever speak to
	Miss Lawson about Mr. Marsh's
	condition?

		DR. TRAMMEL
	No.

		DULANEY
	Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he
	had spoken to Miss Lawson about his
	illness?

		DR. TRAMMEL
	No.

		DULANEY
	Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr.
	Marsh inside during his examinations?

		DR. TRAMMEL
	No.

		DULANEY
	Then you have no way of knowing what
	Mr. Marsh told Miss Lawson were the
	reasons for his visits?

		DR. TRAMMEL
	No.  No, I don't.


INT.  COURTROOM - LATER - DAY

Joanne Braslow is on the stand.  She is wearing a smart
business suit and large-framed glasses.  Her hair is pulled
back tight.  Cardenas stands before her.

								48


		CARDENAS
	How long were you Mr Marsh's personal
	secretary?

		JOANNE
	Six years.

		CARDENAS
	Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use
	Cocaine?

		JOANNE
	No -- never.

		CARDENAS
	What about Miss Lawson?

		JOANNE
	Yes.

		CARDENAS
	Tell the court about that, please.

		JOANNE
	I opened the bathroom door one day
	and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine
	out of a vial.

		CARDENAS
	Did you see Mr. Marsh the day before
	his death?

		JOANNE
	Yes.

		CARDENAS
	How did he look?

		JOANNE
	Horrible.  He was tired and pale.

		CARDENAS
	Did you talk about Miss Lawson?

		JOANNE
	Yes.

		CARDENAS
	What did Mr. Marsh say?


								49

		JOANNE
	He was worried.  He said that she was
	acting stranger and stranger.  He
	said that if this kept up she was
	going to kill him.  That his heart
	couldn't take it.

There is an audible BUZZ from the crowd.  For the first time
Rebecca's confident exterior seems to fade and is replaced with
genuine concern.

		CARDENAS
	Thank you.
		(to Dulaney)
	Your witness.

Cardenas sits down.  Dulaney gets up slowly and walks towards
Joanne.

		DULANEY
	How do you know it was cocaine that
	Miss Lawson had in the bathroom?

		JOANNE
	What other kind of white powder do
	people keep in a vial?

		DULANEY
	Do you remember the date when you saw
	Miss Lawson in the bathroom?

		JOANNE
	Yes--
		(thinks a moment)
	It was on a Friday.  I remember
	because I was going to visit my
	sister for her birthday.  It would be
	October twenty-eighth.

		DULANEY
	Could you repeat the last part of
	what Mr. Marsh said to you the day
	before his death?

		JOANNE
	He said that if it kept up she was
	going to kill him.  That his heart
	couldn't take it.

		DULANEY
	Didn't Mr. Marsh also tell you that
	Miss Lawson felt bored here and was
	thinking about going back to Chicago
	for awhile?


								50

		JOANNE
	Yes -- he mentioned it.

		DULANEY
	So, the woman he loved passionately
	was thinking about leaving.  That
	must cause tremendous anxiety.
	Sleepless nights.  Incredible stress.

		JOANNE
	I suppose.

		DULANEY
	So, isn't it possible that he was
	confiding in you about the pain he
	was feeling about losing what might
	be his last chance for love?  That
	what he really was saying was that
	the uncertainty of her leaving was
	driving him crazy and if it didn't
	stop it was going to kill him.  That
	if she did leave his heart couldn't
	take it.

THE JURY waits anxiously for her answer.

Joanne fidgets in his chair as she thinks.  She appears
confused.

		JOANNE
	I don't know.  I'm not sure.

		DULANEY
	Well, think about it.  Isn't it
	possible?

		JOANNE
		(begrudgingly)
	Yes.  I suppose it's possible.

Cardenas leans back in his seat frustrated.  Rebecca breathes a
sigh of relief.


INT.  UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON

Quiet and desolate -- most of the city employees have left for
the day.  Dulaney walks towards the back of the lot with
Rebecca.

		REBECCA
	You were brilliant today.

		DULANEY
	It's only the beginning.

								51


		REBECCA
	Strong endings start with strong
	beginnings.
		(growing excitement)
	I love the way you twist what people
	say around --  manipulating their own
	words against them.

They reach Rebecca's car.

		DULANEY
	Can I see you later?

		REBECCA
	You can see me now.

Rebecca presses against him, raising her knee gently into his
groin -- as she kisses him passionately.  Dulaney is lost in
her kiss for a moment, then breaks it off and looks around.

Rebecca smiles -- takes off her shoes and stands on the hood of
her car.  She takes one of the shoes and hits the PARKING LOT
OVERHEAD LIGHT FIXTURE.  The BULB breaks sending the area in
darkness.

		DULANEY
	What are you doing?

She steps down and kisses him again.  For a moment he tries to
resist.

		REBECCA
	I want you inside me.

His desire fills him.  He pushes her back onto the hood of her
car, hiking up her dress with his hands, as she reaches down
and unbuttons his pants.


INT.  REBECCA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The room is dimly lit.  Dulaney is in bed.  He appears to be
deep in thought.  Rebecca enters wearing a sheer, silk bathrobe
and carrying a tea service on a tray.  He places it on the bed
and sits beside him.

		REBECCA
	Something wrong?

		DULANEY
	Paley could be a problem tomorrow.


								52

		REBECCA
	I'm sure you'll be able to handle
	him.

		DULANEY
	I'm glad you have such confidence in
	me.

		REBECCA
	Don't worry about Paley.  He can't
	touch me.  No one can.  I've thought
	it all out.

		DULANEY
		(sits up; very
		 concerned)
	What does that mean?  You've been
	thinking about the case?  Or you
	thought everything out before you
	killed Marsh?

The question hurts Rebecca -- it shows on her face.  She looks
away from him.  A beat.  Dulaney thinks.  He feels bad for
asking such a question.

		DULANEY
	I'm sorry.
		(she doesn't look at
		 him)
	Rebecca -- I'm sorry.  Really.

He takes her hand.  She slowly looks at him and smiles.  She
points to the tea service.

		REBECCA
	Sugar or honey?

		DULANEY
	Honey.

She lifts a PLASTIC BOTTLE of HONEY and starts to pour it into
a cup.  She stops and smiles seductively at Dulaney, then parts
her bathrobe and slowly draws a liquid line with it along her
thigh.  She reaches out -- grabs him by the hair and gently
pulls him forward.  He kisses her knee and slowly runs his
tongue along her thigh, following the trail upwards.  She
arches her back -- closes her eyes -- breathes deeply from the
pleasure of his touch.


INT.  DULANEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Dark.  The door opens -- light from the hall streaks into the
room.  Sharon is asleep.  Dulaney enters quietly.  He watches
her.  He looks over at the nightstand.

								53


HIS POV

A PHOTOGRAPH of Dulaney and Sharon on vacation.  Dulaney is
carrying her on a beach.  He is wearing a LARGE SOMBRERO.  They
are both laughing.
Dulaney looks back at Sharon.  He is a man lost within himself.
He walks to the bathroom.  Sharon opens her eyes and stares at
him.


INT.  COURTROOM - MORNING

Court is in session.  Cardenas stands.

		CARDENAS
	The State calls Doctor Alan Paley.

Doctor Paley stands and walks towards the witness stand.

CARDENAS AND PALEY - MOMENTS LATER

Paley has been sworn in.  Cardenas examines him.

		CARDENAS
	Where did you meet Miss Lawson?

		DR. PALEY
	At a dinner party -- about eight
	months ago.

		CARDENAS
	Did you ever see her again after
	that?

		DR. PALEY
	Yes -- several times.

		CARDENAS
	What eventually happened to your
	relationship with Miss Lawson?

		DR. PALEY
	We stopped seeing each other.

		CARDENAS
	Why?

		DR. PALEY
	Well -- I realized that she wasn't
	interested in me.  She was just
	trying to get information out of me.


								54

		CARDENAS
	What kind of information?

		DR. PALEY
	She said that she was working on a
	novel and she wanted to know what
	kinds of drugs would be harmful to
	someone with a bad heart.

WHISPERS from the crowd fill the room.

		CARDENAS
	Did you suggest any?

		DR. PALEY
	Yes -- Insulin and others.

		CARDENAS
	What did she say?

		DR. PALEY
	She said that those weren't any good
	-- because their use would be
	detected and the police would know
	the victim had been poisoned.  She
	wanted to know if there was a drug
	that would induce a heart attack but
	could also be used to enhance a
	sexual high.

		CARDENAS
	-- And what did you suggest?

		DR. PALEY
	Cocaine.

More GASPS from the crowd.  Rebecca's remains calm, but her
eyes glare at Paley hatefully.

		CARDENAS
		(to Dulaney)
	Your witness.

Cardenas sits down.  Dulaney approaches Paley with a smile.

		DULANEY
	Dr. Paley, where were you the last
	time you saw Miss Lawson?

		DR. PALEY
	We had dinner at a restaurant.


								55

		DULANEY
	Isn't it true that later that night
	you tried to force yourself on Miss
	Lawson in the parking lot?

		DR. PALEY
	No.

		DULANEY
	You didn't grab her and try to kiss
	her?

		DR. PALEY
	No.

		DULANEY
	If necessary I can bring in the valet
	parking attendant and two customers
	who witnessed the occurrence.

Paley thinks for a moment.  He is nervous.

		DR. PALEY
	Well -- as I remember it, we had an
	argument.

		DULANEY
	And the argument was about the fact
	that you wanted to be romantically
	involved and she did not.

		DR. PALEY
		(hesitantly)
	Yes.

		DULANEY
	And after that didn't you
	continuously harass Miss Lawson?

		DR. PALEY
	No.

Dulaney walks back to his desk and removes a TAPE PLAYER from a
cardboard box.

		DULANEY
	Your Honor, this is a tape from Miss
	Lawson's answering machine.  I would
	like to play it now.

		CARDENAS
	Objection.  Your Honor, we don't know
	where this tape is from.  Who made it
	-- or under what circumstances it was
	made.

								56


Dulaney takes out two pieces of PAPER and approaches the bench.

		DULANEY
	These are reports from two
	independent audio labs.  They each
	state that the voices were recorded
	over the phone and that no
	alterations have been made.

Judge Burnham studies the paper.

		JUDGE BURNHAM
	I'll allow it.

Dulaney walks back to his desk and presses the PLAY BUTTON.  We
HEAR a BEEP, then...

		DR. PALEY'S VOICE
	Rebecca -- I know you're there,
	Godammit.  Answer the phone, you
	bitch!  You can't treat me like this!

We HEAR a PHONE slam down.  Another BEEP.

		DR. PALEY'S VOICE
	You want to play games with me?  Who
	the fuck do you think you are? Okay -
	- we'll play.  You'll be sorry.

Dulaney stops the machine.  He takes a dramatic pause, letting
the words on the tape sink in.

Cardenas is dismayed and tries to hide his frustration.
Dulaney approaches Paley who is now very nervous.

		DULANEY
		(quoting)
	You'll be sorry?

		DR. PALEY
	I was angry.

		DULANEY
	You're still angry, aren't you?
	Isn't it true that your whole story
	is nothing more than a vindictive
	attempt on your behalf to get back at
	Miss Lawson?

		DR. PALEY
	No -- she asked me about cocaine.

		DULANEY
	I suggest it never happened.

								57


		DR. PALEY
		(angrily)
	You can suggest anything you want.
	It happened.

		DULANEY
	No further questions.

Dr. Paley's temper explodes.  He is a loose cannon.

		DR. PALEY
	I may have been infatuated with her -
	- but I wouldn't perjure myself.

		DULANEY
	That's all Dr. Paley.


INT.  REBECCA'S BEDROOM - EVENING

RAIN FALLS, streaking along the bedroom windows.  CANDLES light
the room.  Dulaney and Rebecca are on the bed.  She sits on top
of him, writhing back and forth -- lost in the rhythm of their
love making.

CLOSE ON DULANEY - LATER

He is asleep, laying on his back -- the sheets pulled up to his
waist.  LIGHTNING FLASHES outside -- a CLAP of THUNDER follows.
He stirs and wakes up.

HIS POV

Another FLASH OF LIGHTNING illuminates Rebecca, who is standing
over him in a sexy silk ROBE.  Dulaney starts to sit up but
something restrains him.  He is HANDCUFFED to the BRASS HEAD
BOARD.

		DULANEY
	What the...  What are you doing?

She sits next to him -- looks at him fondly -- gently strokes
his face with her hand.

		DULANEY
		(nervously)
	Rebecca -- take these off.

		REBECCA
	Tonight we open new doors.


								58

She slowly drags the tip of her finger up his stomach -- to his
chest.  Dulaney follows it with his eyes.  Rebecca picks up a
LARGE CANDLE on the nightstand and moves it slowly -- back and
forth over his chest.

		DULANEY
	What are you going you doing?

		REBECCA
	Are you scared?

He doesn't answer.  He doesn't have to.  She can see the fear
in his eyes.  She tilts the candle -- a stream of WAX pours out
on his chest.  Dulaney winces with pain, his body arching on
the bed, his hands straining against his restraints.

She smiles -- a wicked smile, then pours more wax, making a
thin trail of LITTLE BEADS that moves down his chest towards
his stomach.  Dulaney's face cringes.  He stares at her through
eyes filled with fear.

		REBECCA
		(whispering)
	I love you, Frank.  I love your
	strength -- be strong for me now.

She continues to pour the wax in little BEADS, filling his
navel and working her way towards his groin.

		DULANEY
		(pleading)
	Rebecca -- please.  No more.

Rebecca stares at him warmly -- fondly.

		REBECCA
	I told you in the beginning that it
	was my way.  My way can be many
	things -- pleasure or pain.

She lifts a bottle of white vinegar and holds it over his burn.
He tenses as she pours it on his chest.  -- then relaxes when
he realizes it's water.  He breathes a SIGH of relief.

		REBECCA
	You see how life is, Frank?  We judge
	things.  We look at things from the
	outside and assume we know what's on
	the inside.

She takes a sip from the bottle.


								59

		REBECCA
	Water.  But you assumed it was
	vinegar -- because you were only
	looking at the outside.

Her meaning isn't lost on Dulaney.  She watches him -- as if
studying him -- then slowly -- very slowly,  she pulls on the
belt of her ROBE.  The robe parts revealing the beauty of her
body.  She gently lowers herself on top of him -- pressing her
breasts against him.  Dulaney's breathing quickens in
excitement.  Rebecca moves her head to his chest -- kissing his
burns softly while her fingers caress lightly over his stomach.
She gradually moves her head down -- lower -- and lower.

CLOSE ON DULANEY

he stares at the ceiling -- his mind a maze of confusion.  Soon
the power of her touch fills him -- overpowering him.  His eyes
close.  The pain that only moments ago filled his body is
replaced with pleasure.


INT.  DULANEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

It's late.  Dulaney enters quietly and heads for the stairs.  A
LIGHT comes on.  Sharon is sitting on the couch waiting.

		SHARON
	Late night?

Her voice startles Dulaney.

		DULANEY
	Yeah -- what are you doing up?

		SHARON
	We have to talk.

		DULANEY
	What's wrong?

		SHARON
	That's what I was hoping you'd tell
	me.

Dulaney enters the living room.

		DULANEY
	Sharon, it's late.  Can we get to the
	point?

		SHARON
	Where have you been?


								60

		DULANEY
	Working.  Charlie and I were going
	over some statements.

		SHARON
	Charlie called at eleven thirty
	looking for you.
		(beat)
	You were with her, weren't you?

		DULANEY
	Yes.

		SHARON
	Why did you lie to me?

		DULANEY
	Because I knew you'd think exactly
	what you're thinking.

Sharon springs off the couch.

		SHARON
	This isn't a courtroom.  Don't try to
	turn this around on me.

		DULANEY
	I'm not.

		SHARON
	You're sleeping with her, aren't you?

		DULANEY
	No.

		SHARON
	It's bad enough that you are.  It's
	even worse that you can stand here
	and lie to me.

She starts to walks out of the room.  Dulaney grabs her by the
arm.

		DULANEY
	Sharon...

She swings around and slaps him across the face, then stares at
him angrily, her eyes filled with tears.

		SHARON
	You bastard!  Do you think I'm some
	kind of idiot?  That I don't have
	fuckin' eyes.  I see.  I feel.  I
	hurt.


								61

She walks out of the room, leaving Dulaney alone with his
thoughts.


INT.  COURTROOM - DAY

ESTER CRAWFORD is on the stand.  She is a BLACK WOMAN in her
thirties -- thin and tired-looking, although we get the
impression she once was pretty.  She is dressed in what is
obviously her Sunday dress.  Cardenas questions her.

		CARDENAS
	Mrs. Crawford, you were Mr. Marsh's
	maid for nine years?

		ESTER
	Yes.

		CARDENAS
	Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever
	argue?

		ESTER
	Like cats and dogs.

		CARDENAS
	What did they argue about?

		ESTER
	You name it -- they argued about it.
	Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her
	happy -- but it seemed that no matter
	what he did it was never enough for
	her.

		CARDENAS
	Did they argue the day before he
	died?

		ESTER
	Well -- he died on a Sunday and I
	have the weekends off -- but they
	were ripping at each other with both
	barrels Friday afternoon.

		CARDENAS
	What was the nature of the argument?

		ESTER
	Sex.

		CARDENAS
	Could you be more specific?


								62

		ESTER
	She was calling Mr. Marsh an old man
	-- making discourteous insinuations
	about his sexual abilities.  She said
	that she had needs and that if he
	couldn't fulfill them she'd find
	someone who could.

Dulaney jots down a note.  Cardenas continues.

		CARDENAS
	Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use
	cocaine?

		ESTER
	No -- never.

		CARDENAS
		(to Dulaney)
	Your witness.

Cardenas sits down.  Dulaney approaches Ester with a smile.

		DULANEY
	Did you go to college, Mrs. Crawford?

		ESTER
	No.

		DULANEY
	High school?

		ESTER
	No.

		CARDENAS
	Your Honor, I fail to see what Mrs
	Crawford's educational background has
	to do with this case.

		DULANEY
	I was just about to make my point,
	Your Honor.

		JUDGE BURNHAM
	Do it quickly, Mr. Dulaney.

		DULANEY
		(reading from note
		 pad)
	"Discourteous insinuations about his
	sexual abilities."  Who told you to
	say that?


								63

Ester doesn't answer, but her eyes drift past Dulaney and focus
on Troxell.  Dulaney follows her stare.

		DULANEY
	Did Mr. Troxell help you with that
	phrase?

Troxell and Cardenas squirm a little.

		ESTER
	I heard him say it.

		DULANEY
	Then -- those are not your own words?

		ESTER
	No.

		DULANEY
	What else did the District Attorney's
	Office tell you to say?

		CARDENAS
	Objection, Your Honor.  The fact that
	Mrs. Crawford heard Mr. Troxell
	reconstruct her sentence and decided
	to rephrase her words in a more
	intelligent manner for the court
	doesn't mean the incident never
	happened.

		DULANEY
		(to Cardenas)
	I'm just curious to see if Mr.
	Troxell reconstructed anything else.

		CARDENAS
	Your Honor -- please!

		JUDGE BURNHAM
	I'll see both of you in my chambers.
	Right now.


INT.  JUDGE BURNHAM'S CHAMBERS - MOMENTS LATER

Judge Burnham lights a cigarette and sits on the edge of his
desk.  Dulaney and Cardenas stand before him.


								64

		JUDGE BURNHAM
	Mr. Dulaney, before you cast
	aspersions on the District Attorney's
	Office by suggesting they've coaxed
	this witness to say things that
	aren't true -- you better have more
	than a hunch.  Do you?

		DULANEY
	No, Your Honor.

		JUDGE BURNHAM
	Maybe you don't know what it's like
	where Mrs. Crawford comes from -- but
	I do.  I came from a neighborhood
	just like hers.  This is a whole
	other world for her.  She's a poor
	working woman who has been thrust
	into a room full of highly educated
	and mostly unsympathetic people.  So,
	she puts on her best dress, fixes her
	hair and tries to present herself as
	intelligently as possible.
		(beat)
	Being poor and having pride is not a
	crime, Mr. Dulaney -- and before you
	attempt to impeach another witness'
	testimony in my courtroom -- your
	foundations better be based on
	something other than semantics.


EXT.  COURTHOUSE - AFTERNOON

Dulaney walks down the steps.  Cardenas joins him.

		CARDENAS
	I'm surprised you can walk after the
	way Burnham chewed your ass out this
	afternoon.

Cardenas grins.  His comment was meant as a friendly jab
between old friends.  Dulaney doesn't see it that way.

		DULANEY
		(coldly)
	I've got work to do.

		CARDENAS
	Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's
	between rounds.

		DULANEY
	I didn't hear it.


								65

		CARDENAS
	What's happening to you, Frank?
	You're acting like you're on trial
	here.  This has become personal to
	you.

		DULANEY
	Back off, John.

Cardenas studies him for a moment.

		CARDENAS
	You're sleeping with her, aren't you?

Dulaney forces a laugh.  It's not a very convincing one.

		DULANEY
	That's ridiculous.

		CARDENAS
	I'm talking to you as a friend now.
	Don't ruin your life, your career for
	her.  She'll spit you out when this
	is over.

		DULANEY
	You don't know what you're talking
	about.

		CARDENAS
	Really?  What does an attorney speak
	to his client about at her house
	until three o'clock in the morning?

		DULANEY
	You've been following me?

		CARDENAS
	Her.  It's an obvious move.  I'm
	building a case against her,
	remember?

Something in Dulaney snaps.  He grabs Cardenas and pushes him
up against the wall.  Cardenas pushes back.

		CARDENAS
	If your head wasn't up your ass you
	would have thought of it too.  You're
	losing perspective.  Get out while
	you can -- before she takes you down
	with her.



								66

INT.  HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

Dulaney walks towards his office.  Biggs walks quickly down the
hall and joins him.

		BIGGS
	I've been waiting for you to get
	back.

		DULANEY
	You got something on the coke?

		BIGGS
	No -- but I got something.

Biggs steps into Dulaney's office.  Dulaney follows.


INT.  DULANEY'S OFFICE - MORNING

Biggs picks up a remote control off the desk and sits on the
couch.  Dulaney sits at his desk.

		BIGGS
	During lunch I was watching some of
	Marsh's home videos.

Biggs clicks the control.  On the TV we see Rebecca on top of
Marsh in the bedroom.

		BIGGS
	He was really into recording this
	stuff.  The D.A.'s office found a box
	full of tapes.

Watching Rebecca with Marsh bothers Dulaney.

		BIGGS
	This girl has really got some moves,
	huh?

Dulaney stands up and turns off the television.

		DULANEY
	If you want to get your kicks go to a
	video store and rent a porno movie.

Biggs studies Dulaney for a moment.  Dulaney's reaction bothers
him.  He turns the TV back on and fast forwards the tape.  The
screen turns to SNOW where the tape has been recorded over.

		BIGGS
	This tape was recorded over an
	existing recording.


								67

		DULANEY
	Over what?

Biggs raises a hand signaling patience.  SNOW still fills the
TV screen.

		BIGGS
	I would have missed it -- but the
	phone rang and I let it play while I
	talked.  It looks like blank tape --
	but it isn't.  It's been erased
	without any input signal coming in.

		DULANEY
	So, what good is it to us if it's
	been erased?

		BIGGS
	It's very good -- because when the
	D.A's office saw it they assumed it
	was the end of the tape, otherwise
	they would have buried it.

		DULANEY
	Why?

		BIGGS
	Because it hasn't all been erased.

Biggs looks at the screen.  A beat.  The SNOW dissolves and a
picture fades in.  The PICTURE LASTS only about five seconds.
We see Rebecca from the back as she straddles Marsh, grinding
up and down on the bed -- her hair flowing down her back.
Marsh raises his hand.  His WRIST IS IN A CAST.  She turns her
head to the side and as she does we see that it is not Rebecca
-- but Joanne Braslow.  The Tape clicks off.

Dulaney stares at the blank screen.

		DULANEY
		(quoting Joanne)
	Where's the attraction to sleep with
	someone like that.


EXT.  PARKING LOT - DUSK

Joanne Braslow walks to her BMW 325i.  She is about to open the
door when Dulaney approaches her.

		DULANEY
	I need to speak with you.


								68

		JOANNE
	I don't think we have anything more
	to talk about, Mr. Dulaney.

She starts to get in the car.

		DULANEY
	You were sleeping with Marsh.

She stops -- appears shocked that he knows this.  There is now
a different quality to her -- an edge.

		JOANNE
	Who told you that?

		DULANEY
	He video taped you.

		JOANNE
	That bastard!

		DULANEY
	I thought he was a kind, gentle man?

Joanne doesn't appreciate Dulaney throwing her words back in
her face.

		JOANNE
	Yes, I slept with him but that was a
	long time ago.

		DULANEY
	You're lying.  Marsh was wearing a
	cast on the tape.  It was right
	before he went to Chicago and met
	Miss Lawson.  He dumped you for her,
	didn't he?

Joanne can't hold back the emotion that is building.

		JOANNE
	Yes.

		DULANEY
	It must have been horrible.  Having
	to go there -- seeing them together -
	- knowing he was sleeping with her in
	the same bed he did with you.

		JOANNE
	I was jealous.  Of course I was hurt.
	He switched me off like a little toy
	he was finished playing with.  But I
	didn't kill him.


								69

Dulaney studies her.

		JOANNE
		(continuing)
	I'm a practical woman Mr. Dulaney.
	Killing Andrew wasn't in my best
	interest.  As it is I'm out of a job
	and I'm not in his will.

		DULANEY
	Money isn't the only reason people
	commit murder, Miss Braslow.

Dulaney walks off.  Joanne stares after him.  Her face is cold,
showing no sign of emotion.


INT.  COURTROOM - DAY

Dulaney sits beside Rebecca, but he seems distant.  Cardenas
stands up.

		CARDENAS
	The State calls Jeffery Roston.

As soon as she hears the name Rebecca's face becomes tense,
nervous.  Dulaney notices it.  He checks a list.

		DULANEY
	Your Honor, I don't see a Mr. Roston
	listed as a prosecution witness.

		CARDENAS
	The State's investigation just
	uncovered Mr. Roston yesterday
	afternoon in Chicago.

Judge Burnham motions for Dulaney and Cardenas to approach the
bench.

		CARDENAS
	Your Honor, Mr. Roston is an ex-lover
	of Miss Lawson's.

		JUDGE BURNHAM
	Why didn't the State's investigation
	uncover Mr. Roston earlier?

		CARDENAS
	He was away on an extended vacation
	and just returned two days ago.

		JUDGE BURNHAM
	Alright -- I'm going to allow his
	testimony.

								70


		DULANEY
	But Your Honor--

		JUDGE BURNHAM
	That's it, Mr. Dulaney.  Take a seat.

Dulaney walks back to his chair.  Rebecca appears genuinely
nervous.


INT.  COURTROOM - LATER

Cardenas stands before ROSTON a handsome man with salt and
pepper hair in his late fifties.

		CARDENAS
	Mr. Roston, what was your
	relationship with Miss Lawson?

		ROSTON
	We were lovers.

		CARDENAS
	How long were you together?

		ROSTON
	For about one year.

		CARDENAS
	How would you describe your sex life
	with Miss Lawson?

		ROSTON
	Intense.

		CARDENAS
	I know this is a very personal
	subject, but could you be a little
	more specific?

		ROSTON
	It was wild.  She was constantly
	trying to get me more and more worked
	up -- kinky things.  I tried to
	satisfy her the best I could, but it
	was difficult in my condition.

		CARDENAS
	What kind of condition are you
	referring to?

		ROSTON
	I had a bad heart.


								71

There is an AUDIBLE GASP from the crowd.  Cardenas waits,
giving the jury plenty of time to digest the implications of
Roston's last statement.

Dulaney looks at Rebecca dumbfounded.  He tries to control his
surprise from the eyes of the jury, but he can't.  He stares
ahead with a blank expression as he listens to the rest of the
testimony.

		CARDENAS
	What happened next?

		ROSTON
	I had bypass surgery.

		CARDENAS
	And how are you now?

		ROSTON
	Fine.  The doctors say if I keep
	taking care of myself I can live to
	be a very old man.

		CARDENAS
	How did your relationship with Miss
	Lawson progress after the surgery?

		ROSTON
	It didn't.

		CARDENAS
	Why not?

		ROSTON
	She left me.

Dulaney slowly turns and looks at Rebecca.  The anger and his
sense of betrayal show on his face.

		CARDENAS
	Why did she say she was leaving?

		ROSTON
	She didn't.  She just left.

		CARDENAS
	Why do you think she left you?

		ROSTON
	Well -- I think that after the
	operation she realized that...

It takes Dulaney a few seconds to object to the question.  He
is clearly preoccupied with the implications of Roston's
testimony.

								72


		DULANEY
	Objection.  The question calls for a
	conclusion on the part of the
	witness.

		CARDENAS
	Your Honor, Mr. Roston lived with the
	defendant for many months.  I feel
	that his opinion is valid in
	substantiating the character of the
	Miss Lawson.

		DULANEY
	The opinion of a scorned lover is
	hardly an objective view.

		JUDGE BURNHAM
	Objection sustained.

		CARDENAS
	Did Miss Lawson ever give you any
	indication why she was leaving?

		DULANEY
	Objection.  The witness has already
	stated that Miss Lawson left without
	an explanation.

		JUDGE BURNHAM
	Mr. Cardenas, I suggest you move on
	to another line of questioning.

		CARDENAS
	When you say your sexual relations
	with Miss Lawson were intense what
	exactly do you mean?

		ROSTON
	It was like she was trying to push me
	as far as she could.  She called it
	opening new doors.

		CARDENAS
	Can you give the court an example?

		ROSTON
	It was like sex was a game to her.
	She got off on the control.  She
	always used to tell me it had to be
	her way.

This strikes a chord with Dulaney.


								73

		ROSTON
		(continuing)
	It's hard to resist a woman as
	beautiful as she is.

		CARDENAS
	What would she do that made it hard
	to resist?

		ROSTON
	She's a woman who is very much aware
	of her own sexuality.  Sometimes I
	felt she could read my mind.  It was
	uncanny how she knew exactly what I
	wanted.  A few nights before my heart
	surgery Rebecca woke me.  She had
	handcuffed me to the bed.

There are a few SNICKERS from the crowd.  Dulaney is thinking
about the familiarity of Roston's testimony.  Judge Burnham
BANGS his GAVEL.  The crowd becomes silent.

		ROSTON
	She told me that tonight we were
	going to open new doors.  I asked her
	to stop -- to take off the handcuffs,
	but she wouldn't listen.

		CARDENAS
	What did she say?

Roston is clearly uncomfortable having to relate this part of
his life.

		CARDENAS
	Mr. Roston I know this is difficult
	for you, but it's important you tell
	the court what she did.

		ROSTON
	She said she was going to fuck me
	like I've never been fucked before.

More noise from the Crowd.  Judge Burnham is annoyed.  He BANGS
his gavel again.

		JUDGE BURNHAM
	Due to the sensitive nature of this
	witness' testimony and the inability
	of the spectators to allow him to
	complete it, I am clearing the
	courtroom.

Sounds of protest fill the room as the BAILIFFS start to usher
out the crowd.

								74



INT.  COURTROOM LATER

The gallery is empty.  Only Dulaney, Rebecca, Cardenas,
Troxell, Roston, Judge Burnham, The Jury and Court Officials
remain.

		CARDENAS
	What did she do next, Mr. Roston?

		ROSTON
	She started touching herself and
	telling me how much she wanted me.
	She reached down and put me inside
	her.  My doctor had warned me about
	exerting myself -- but you really
	don't think of those things at a
	moment like that.  You just think
	about how beautiful this woman is --
	how much you want her.  How deeply
	you want to please her.
		(beat)
	At first it started off slowly -- but
	the rhythm built and built.    Every
	time I got close to an orgasm she
	would stop.  Eventually I started to
	have trouble breathing.  Rebecca just
	kept going -- faster and faster.  No
	matter what I said she wouldn't stop.
	I really thought for a moment I was
	going to die.

		CARDENAS
	If you knew it was bad for you why
	did you do it?

		ROSTON
	I couldn't help myself.  You get lost
	inside a women like her.  It was like
	a drug.  It was the best sex I ever
	had.

		CARDENAS
	What happened after that?

		ROSTON
	I woke up the next morning and she
	was gone.

		CARDENAS
	Did you change your will while you
	were with Miss Lawson?


								75

		ROSTON
	Yes.

		CARDENAS
	Who was your primary beneficiary?

		ROSTON
	She was.

		CARDENAS
	Thank you.  The State rests.

		JUDGE BURNHAM
	Mister Dulaney?

Dulaney is stunned -- deep in thought.  He doesn't appear to
hear the question.

		JUDGE BURNHAM
	Mister Dulaney?

Dulaney looks at the jury.  What he sees isn't good.  He thinks
for a moment.  He leans over and quickly speaks with Rebecca.
We cannot hear them -- but their conversation is heated.
Rebecca says something.  Dulaney looks at Roston.  A beat.
Dulaney stands.

		DULANEY
	Mr. Roston, you said it was the best
	sex you ever had.  Is that the best
	sex with a woman, or a man?

Cardenas bolts from his seat.

		CARDENAS
	Objection!

		DULANEY
	I'll rephrase the question.  Mr.
	Roston isn't it true you are
	bisexual?

		CARDENAS
	Objection!  Mr. Roston's sexual
	preferences are not at issue in this
	trial.

		DULANEY
	Your Honor, I'm trying to establish
	the sense of betrayal Miss Lawson
	felt when she discovered the man she
	lived with was a different person
	than she thought he was.

Judge Burnham thinks for a moment.

								76


		JUDGE BURNHAM
	The witness will answer the question.

		DULANEY
	Mr. Roston?

		ROSTON
	Yes.

		DULANEY
	And your sexual tastes were something
	that you hid from Miss Lawson?

		ROSTON
	Yes.

		DULANEY
	And didn't Miss Lawson come home one
	day and find you in bed with your
	male lover?

		ROSTON
	Yes.

		DULANEY
	And she left shortly after that?

A pause.  Roston thinks, struggling to make a decision.

		ROSTON
	No.  We worked things out.  It was
	three weeks later when I told her
	about the heart surgery that she
	left.

Roston looks around the court room.  He is embarrassed, filled
with emotion.

		DULANEY
	Would it be fair to say that when she
	did find out it was a shock to her?

		ROSTON
		(very upset)
	Yes.

		DULANEY
	No further questions.

Roston looks at the jury -- their disapproving stares.  He is
on the verge of tears.



								77

INT.  REBECCA'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

Rebecca opens the door.  A tired-looking Dulaney enters.  They
walk to the couch together in silence.  Dulaney sits.  Rebecca
lifts a BOTTLE of CHAMPAGNE out of an ice bucket.

		DULANEY
	What's that for?

		REBECCA
	To celebrate how masterfully you
	destroyed Roston today.

		DULANEY
	Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life
	in open court.

		REBECCA
		(suddenly ice cold)
	Fuck him!  He tried to shatter mine.

		DULANEY
	He was only doing what he thought was
	right.

		REBECCA
	You're too weak, Frank.  When you
	want something you have to do what-
	ever it takes to get it.  If
	something gets in your way you remove
	it.

Dulaney stares at her.  The person he sees has no feelings --
no empathy for anyone.

		DULANEY
	You killed him -- didn't you?

		REBECCA
	I knew you were thinking that.  I
	could see it in your eyes today in
	the courtroom.  You're wrong, Frank.
	I need you to believe that.

		DULANEY
	You don't need anybody.

		REBECCA
	I do need you.  No matter what you
	think of me -- I didn't do it.

								78

		(beat)
	I could see the looks on the juror's
	faces.  To the men I represent what
	they can never have.  I'm a cold,
	heartless bitch -- and this is their
	chance for pay-back for every woman
	that's ever blown them off in a bar.
	To the old women I'm a vulgar whore
	and to the young ones I remind them
	of what they'll never be.  It doesn't
	matter to them that I'm innocent.
	They've already convicted me.

		DULANEY
	I'm dropping the case.

		REBECCA
		(matter of factly)
	No -- you're not.

Rebecca picks up a REMOTE CONTROL from the coffee table and
pushes a button.

CLOSE ON TELEVISION

A TAPE of Dulaney making love to Rebecca fills the screen.  It
is wild, passionate.

CLOSE ON DULANEY

he is dumbfounded as he watches.  The implications of what this
tape could do to him run through his mind.

Something in Dulaney snaps.  He grabs Rebecca.  They struggle,
falling down onto the coffee table.  The CHAMPAGNE bottle
crashes to the floor.  Rebecca rolls off the table to the
floor.  She sits up and moves away from Dulaney by pushing
herself backwards.  Dulaney lunges at her.  His hand grabbing
her ankle.  Rebecca kicks -- breaks free -- stands up.  Dulaney
gets to his feet -- runs after her.  He grabs her by the throat
and smashes her into the wall.  He slaps her across the face.
A thin stream of blood flows from the corner of her mouth.  She
smiles.

		REBECCA
	It gets easier, doesn't it?  Once you
	open the door it never closes.

Dulaney realizes what he is doing.  He stares at her in horror,
then walks towards the door. He stops.  Goes back to the VHS
machine.  He pushes the EJECT BUTTON on the VCR, removes the
tape and destroys it.


								79

		REBECCA
	I've got another copy.  How do you
	think your wife would feel if she saw
	this -- not to mention your
	colleagues?

Dulaney's temper is near the breaking point again, he strains
to control himself.

		REBECCA
	You can think whatever you want,
	Frank -- but I didn't kill Andrew,
	and I'm not going to prison for
	something I didn't do.

		DULANEY
	You're a monster.

		REBECCA
	No -- I'm a survivor.


INT.  DULANEY'S HOUSE, DINNING ROOM - NIGHT

Dulaney, Sharon and Michael sit at the table eating dinner.
There is a tense silence.  Although Michael does not know what
is going on he can sense the tension.  The DOORBELL RINGS.

		DULANEY
	I'll get it.


INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Dulaney answers the front door and Biggs rushes in excited.

		BIGGS
	I'm sorry to barge in -- but I
	figured after that bombshell that got
	laid on you today you could use some
	good news?

		DULANEY
	You got something on the Coke?

Biggs grins.

		BIGGS
	Do I?  I talked to one of the dealers
	I put the word out to.  He's been
	following the trial pretty closely.
	He said at one time he wanted to be a
	lawyer before he became a dealer.


								80

		DULANEY
	Charlie -- are you going to make a
	point soon?

		BIGGS
	Right now.  Guess who's been buying
	Coke from him for the last five and
	half years?

Dulaney shrugs his shoulders indicating he doesn't have a clue.

		BIGGS
	Marsh's secretary -- Joanne Braslow.

Confusion fills Dulaney's face.


INT.  COURTROOM - MORNING

Court is in session.  Rebecca looks around the courtroom,
trying to get a feel of the CROWD'S opinion.  Dulaney is not
there.  She looks at the door anxiously.  The rooms waits.  A
beat.  Dulaney enters -- sits beside Rebecca -- but acts as if
she isn't there.


INT.  COURTROOM - LATER

Dulaney stands at the witness stand in front of an ORIENTAL MAN
in his thirties.

		DULANEY
	Dr. Wong -- what type of medicine do
	you practice?

		DR. WONG
	Oriental medicine.

		DULANEY
	--And is Miss Lawson a patient of
	yours?

		DR. WONG
	Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a
	year.

		DULANEY
	Why does she come to you?

		DR. WONG
	She suffers from severe menstrual
	cramps.


								81

		DULANEY
	Did you ever prescribe any medication
	for her cramps?

		DR. WONG
	Yes.

		DULANEY
	What did you prescribe for her?

		DR. WONG
	Chinese peony root.

		DULANEY
	Would you describe for the court what
	Chinese peony root looks like?

		DR. WONG
	It's a white powder that comes in a
	vial.

There is a MOAN from the CROWD.  Cardenas looks at Troxell.

		DULANEY
	How do you instruct your patients to
	take it?

		DR. WONG
	I tell them to pour an amount the
	size of a quarter into the their hand
	and mix it with water.

		DULANEY
	A previous witness stated that she
	saw Miss Lawson pouring a white
	powder into her hand on October
	twenty-eighth.  According to your
	records when did you prescribe the
	drug?

Dr. Wong checks his records.

		DR. WONG
	October twenty-seventh.

		DULANEY
	One last question, Doctor.  If
	someone didn't know better, would it
	be easy to mistake the peony root for
	cocaine?

		DR. WONG
	Yes -- quite easy.


								82

		DULANEY
		(to Cardenas)
	Your witness.

Cardenas realizes there is nothing to gain by examining this
witness.

		CARDENAS
	No questions.

		JUDGE BURNHAM
	You may call your next witness.

		DULANEY
	The defense calls Miss Margaret
	Sellers.

Cardenas looks worried as he watches an attractive woman in her
mid twenties approach the stand.

DULANEY AND MISS SELLERS

Miss Sellers appears a little nervous.  Dulaney smiles warmly.

		DULANEY
	Miss Sellers, do you know Dr. Alan
	Paley?

		MISS SELLERS
	Yes.

		DULANEY
	Where did you meet him?

		MISS SELLERS
	I'm a nurse.  I used to work at
	Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr.
	Paley's on staff there.

		DULANEY
	What was the nature of your
	relationship with Dr. Paley.

		MISS SELLERS
	We dated for about a month last year.

		DULANEY
	Then what happened?

		MISS SELLERS
	I realized he wasn't serious.  He was
	seeing other women -- asking other
	nurses at the hospital out, so I
	ended it.


								83

		DULANEY
	-- And what did Dr. Paley do after
	you stopped seeing him?

		MISS SELLERS
	He used to call me -- tell me that I
	couldn't just walk out on him.  He
	said that if I didn't come back he'd
	make my life miserable.

		DULANEY
	Did he make your life miserable?

		MISS SELLERS
	Yes -- he did.

		DULANEY
	How?

Cardenas stands again.

		CARDENAS
	Objection!  May I remind Mr. Dulaney
	that the person on trial here is Miss
	Lawson -- not Dr. Paley.

		DULANEY
	Your Honor, I'm trying to establish a
	pattern in Dr. Paley's behavior with
	women.

		JUDGE BURNHAM
	Objection overruled.  The witness
	will answer the question.

		MISS SELLERS
	He'd call me in the middle of the
	night.  Show up at my house and bang
	on the door.  Finally after two weeks
	I went to his office one day to tell
	him to stop.

		DULANEY
	What did he say?

		MISS SELLERS
	He laughed -- and basically said he
	would decide when it was over.

		DULANEY
	Do you remember his exact words?


								84

		MISS SELLERS
	Yes.  He said, "If you want to play
	games, we'll play -- and you'll be
	sorry."

Another BUZZ from the CROWD.   Cardenas inwardly cringes.

		DULANEY
	What happened next?

		MISS SELLERS
	While I was seeing Dr. Paley I
	mentioned to him one night that
	someone was stealing drugs from the
	third floor dispensary.   Three days
	after I spoke to him in his office he
	went to the Head Nurse and told her
	he had witnessed me stealing drugs.

		DULANEY
	What happened?

		MISS SELLERS
	There was an inquiry.  It was his
	word against mine.  They believed
	him.  I was fired.


INT.  DULANEY'S OFFICE - DUSK

Dulaney is at his desk.  Biggs enters excited.

		BIGGS
	Joanne Braslow is getting more and
	more interesting.  I followed her
	today to an attorney's office.
	Joseph Koehler.

		DULANEY
	Joe Koehler.  I know him.  He's an
	estate attorney -- and he's very
	expensive.

		BIGGS
	What would Joanne Braslow need with
	an estate attorney?  She wasn't even
	mentioned in Marsh's will.

Dulaney thinks for a moment.  He grins as an idea enters his
mind.

		DULANEY
	Not this will.


								85

INT.  FILE ROOM - EVENING

Dulaney and Biggs sit at a table going through a stack of
papers.  Dulaney traces his finger along a piece of paper.

		DULANEY
	Here it is!  According to the old
	will Joanne Braslow was to inherit
	two hundred and fifty thousand
	dollars.

		BIGGS
	What good does that do -- it's the
	old will?

		DULANEY
	Under the law a person cannot profit
	from their own wrong doing.  Since
	Rebecca Lawson is the sole
	beneficiary of the new will, if she
	is found guilty the will is void and
	Joanne Braslow could make a very good
	case to have the old will reinstated.

		BIGGS
	She kills the old man and makes it
	look like Miss Lawson did it.  Pretty
	slick.


INT.  DULANEY'S HOUSE, BATHROOM - EVENING

Dulaney is washing up for dinner.  He speaks to Sharon who is
in the bedroom.

		DULANEY
	I was thinking that when the trial is
	over we'd all go skiing for a
	weekend.

		SHARON
	Maybe it would be a good idea if you
	just took Michael.

Sharon leaves the room.  Dulaney reaches for his TOOTHBRUSH --
picks up a TUBE of TOOTH PASTE.  It is empty.  He stares at the
EMPTY TUBE.

		DULANEY
		(to himself)
	Drug store.


INT.  COURTROOM - MORNING


								86

Dulaney looks worn, tired -- the tension between him and
Rebecca shows.

		JUDGE BURNHAM
	Mr. Dulaney, are you ready to call
	your next witness?

Dulaney doesn't seem to hear him.

		JUDGE BURNHAM
	Mr. Dulaney, are you with us?

Dulaney snaps out of it.

		DULANEY
	Yes, Your Honor.  The defense recalls
	Joanne Braslow.

As Joanne walks towards the stand Dulaney looks over at
Rebecca.  It's as if he is trying to make up his mind about
her.  Joanne takes her seat.

		JUDGE BURNHAM
	Miss Braslow, I'd like to remind you
	that you are still under oath.

		DULANEY
	How often do you use cocaine?

Cardenas shoots out of his seat.

		CARDENAS
	Objection, Your Honor.

		JUDGE BURNHAM
		(impatiently)
	Counsel approach the bench.

Dulaney and Cardenas walk over to the bench.

		JUDGE BURNHAM
	Mr. Dulaney, I'm getting tired of
	seeing you this close to me.

Judge Burnham looks at Cardenas indicating he will hear his
argument now.

		CARDENAS
	Whether or not Miss Braslow uses
	drugs is not an issue here.


								87

		DULANEY
	Your Honor -- the prosecution has
	introduced cocaine as one of the
	contributing reasons Mr. Marsh died.
	How it may have been introduced into
	the household is of vital importance.

		JUDGE BURNHAM
	Are you able to back up this
	allegation -- or are you fishing?

		DULANEY
	I can back it up.

		JUDGE BURNHAM
	You better.
		(to Joanne)
	Please answer the question.

		JOANNE
	I've tried it.

		DULANEY
	You've tried it?  Isn't it true that
	you've been in and out of Rehab
	centers for the last four years?

This is clearly embarrassing for her.

		JOANNE
	I've been to a few -- yes.

		DULANEY
	You don't like Miss Lawson much do
	you?

		JOANNE
		(hesitantly)
	No.

		DULANEY
	You don't like her because you were
	involved with Mr. Marsh before she
	came along.  Isn't that true?

		JOANNE
	Yes.

		DULANEY
	You resented the fact that she told
	you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?

		JOANNE
	Yes.


								88

Dulaney moves the questions along, quickening their pace,
building a rhythm.

		DULANEY
	And you resented that he cared for
	her in a way he once cared for you?

		JOANNE
		(breaking down)
	Yes.

		DULANEY
	--And that Mr. Marsh paid less
	attention to you?

		JOANNE
	Yes.

		DULANEY
	--and that he changed his will?

		JOANNE
	Yes.

She has blurted out the answer before the full implications of
the question has dawned on her.  Her face reveals her mistake.

Cardenas can only watch uncomfortably from his seat.

		DULANEY
	In his previous will Mr. Marsh left
	you two hundred and fifty thousand
	dollars -- then he cut you out.  Why
	do you think he did that?

		JOANNE
	She talked him into it.  She wanted
	everything.

		DULANEY
	Two hundred and fifty thousand
	dollars is a lot of money.  That must
	have made you pretty angry?

		JOANNE
	Yes.

Dulaney picks up a small PIECE OF PAPER and walks towards
Joanne.

		DULANEY
	You testified that you returned to
	Mr. Marsh's house at eleven o'clock
	the night of his murder.  Is that
	correct?

								89


		JOANNE
	Yes.

		DULANEY
	Well - I'm a little confused.
		(holds up the paper)
	This is a charge receipt from Rosen's
	Drug Store where Mr. Marsh had an
	account.  It's dated the day of the
	murder.
		(hands it to her)
	Is this your signature?

		JOANNE
		(nervously studies
		 it)
	Yes.

		DULANEY
	There's an item you picked up that's
	marked.  Will you read it?

		JOANNE
	Dristan nasal spray.

		DULANEY
	Would you read for us the time of the
	purchase?

		JOANNE
	Three fifteen.

		DULANEY
	A.M -- or P.M.?

		JOANNE
	P.M.

		DULANEY
	You see that's what bothers me.  No
	other bottle of nasal spray was found
	in the house.  The police looked.
	There was only the one bottle.  But
	you say you didn't arrive until after
	Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he
	was using the nasal spray prior to
	his death.  How do you think it got
	there?

		JOANNE
	I don't know.


								90

		DULANEY
	Isn't it true that you stopped by the
	house after you left the drug store
	and dropped off the items you bought?

		JOANNE
		(nervously)
	No.

		DULANEY
	Isn't it true that you put the
	cocaine in the bottle?

		JOANNE
	No!  Why would I want to kill him?

		DULANEY
	Because you were jealous.  Because he
	cut you out of the will.  Because you
	have a cocaine habit to feed --
	because you know that if Rebecca
	Lawson is found guilty the new will
	is void -- and there's a very good
	chance the old one would be honored.

SILENCE fills the room.  Members of the JURY look at Rebecca,
they are confused -- doubt fills their minds.

		DULANEY
	The defense rests.


INT.  DULANEY'S DEN - EVENING

Dark.  Dulaney is standing by the window, watching the RAIN
FALL outside.  Sharon enters.

		SHARON
	We can't go on like this, Frank.

Dulaney continues to stare out the window.

		DULANEY
	I know.

		SHARON
	Talk to me.

He shakes his NO.

		SHARON
	Please -- this is ripping us apart.


								91

		DULANEY
		(emotionally)
	I can't talk about it now.

She senses his pain and moves to him, wrapping her arms around
his shoulders.

		SHARON
	Don't shut me out.  Let me in.

He turns and faces her.  She can see the pain on his face.

		DULANEY
	You wouldn't like what you'd see.
	You don't know me anymore.  I don't
	know me anymore.

		SHARON
	We can't pretend this isn't
	happening.

		DULANEY
	Please -- not now.

		SHARON
	Why didn't you come to me?

		DULANEY
	I don't know.

		SHARON
	You used to like to touch me -- to
	make love to me.

		DULANEY
	It's more involved than that.

		SHARON
	It was a place to start.

		DULANEY
	You think that's the answer?  Sex?
	Is that what you want?  You want me
	to make love to you?

		SHARON
	I don't want our lives ruined because
	of this.  I love you, Frank.  I want
	this to work -- but you have to help
	me.  You have to come back from where
	ever it is you are.


								92

Dulaney's confusion and emotion begins to surface.  She kisses
him, softly, gently.  Dulaney closes his eyes.  He kisses her
harder - and harder.  His passion builds -- his anger grows.
He runs his arm over his desk, brushing everything to the
floor.

He grabs her and firmly pushes her down on the desk.  He kisses
her forcefully, his lips pressed hard against hers.  She
struggles against him.  His hands tear at her blouse.  It is
rough, angry sex and it frightens Sharon.

		SHARON
		(screaming)
	Frank -- stop it!  Stop it!

		DULANEY
	Is this what you want -- huh?  Is it?

She is crying now -- struggling futilely against him.

		SHARON
	Let me go!  Godammit, Frank let go!

		MICHAEL (OS)
		(racked with fear)
	Daddy -- stop it!

Dulaney stops and looks.

Michael is standing in the doorway, his face filled with fear
and incomprehension.  Tears streak down his face.

Dulaney freezes as the full power of his actions overwhelm him.
His face floods with anguish as he tries to grasp the total
effect of his behavior.

		DULANEY
		(softly)
	Oh -- Jesus.

Filled with pain and embarrassment Dulaney runs from the room.


EXT.  BAND SHELL, PARK - NIGHT

RAIN falls in sheets.  Dulaney sits inside the small structure,
huddled against one of the pillars.  He is a tragic figure,
desperately trying to claw his way back to the world he once
knew.



								93

EXT.  DULANEY'S HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT

RAIN continues to fall.  Dulaney is standing across the street,
staring at the house.  He crosses over and is half way to the
door when he stops.  He starts to leave.

The front door opens and Sharon steps out onto the porch.

		SHARON
	Frank?

He turns around slowly.  He can't bring himself to look at her.
She walks out into the rain.  He lifts his head.  Tears flow
down his face and he cries.  When she begins to cry with him
he breaks down.

		DULANEY
		(ashamed)
	I'm sorry.  God -- I'm so sorry.

He slowly drops to his knees -- holding on to her as if she
were a strong tree in a wind-storm.

		DULANEY
	Help me.  Please -- help me.


INT.  COURTROOM - DAY

Dulaney sits beside Rebecca. There is tension between them.  He
does not look at her.

		JUDGE BURNHAM
	Mr. Dulaney.

Dulaney stands and walks over to the jury.

		DULANEY
	The Prosecution's case is built on
	theory -- speculation.  Could Rebecca
	Lawson have done this?  Is it
	possible that she did that? Where are
	the facts?  The evidence.  The State
	has presented two spurned lovers and
	a jealous secretary.  Hardly what I
	would call impartial witnesses.
	Where is one shred of conclusive,
	irrefutable evidence?  I don't see it
	-- and I don't think you do either.
	Do you know why?  Because there isn't
	any.

								94

		(beat)
	What's the issue here?  That Rebecca
	Lawson likes wild sex?  No.  But the
	District Attorney is trying to make
	you think if Rebecca Lawson could
	stray from the path of normal,
	accepted sexual behavior, then she
	could be capable of murder.  Did she
	force Andrew Marsh to make love to
	her?  Did she hold a gun to his head?
	No.  Andrew Marsh wanted her -- and
	why wouldn't he?  She's beautiful,
	alluring -- the type of woman men
	dream about.

As Dulaney continues we sense he is applying his closing
arguments to himself.

		DULANEY
	It's human nature.  We want what we
	want -- when we want it.  We don't
	think about the consequences of our
	actions.  When desire fills us we all
	do things that we know are bad for
	us.  We live for the moment.
		(beat)
	Here was an exciting young woman who
	unlocked doors.  Doors that led into
	a new world.  A world he entered
	willingly -- eagerly.  He wanted to
	please her -- and so, he did not tell
	her of his illness.  I know it might
	be difficult for you to understand
	wanting something so badly that you
	are willing to risk everything -- but
	that's what passion does to you.
	It's a fire -- uncontrollable.  It
	consumes you -- and the only thing
	you can do is let it burn.  Andrew
	Marsh let it burn.  It was his life -
	- his choice -- and maybe his mistake
	-- but making love is not a crime.
		(beat)
	We all have fires inside us -- secret
	desires.  We guard them --hold them
	in the cages that we've built.  When
	someone comes along and opens the
	gate, they rush out and feed blindly
	on their pleasure.  Rebecca Lawson
	loved Andrew Marsh.  She didn't kill
	him -- if anything did, it was his
	own passion.


								95

Dulaney walks back to his table and sits down.  Rebecca looks
at him warmly.  Dulaney does not look at her.  Cardenas stands
to address the jury.

		CARDENAS
	It's true -- we all have fires
	burning inside us.  Rebecca Lawson
	was very aware of the fire burning
	inside Andrew Marsh -- and she stoked
	those flames -- fanning them until
	they burned so hot that reason and
	judgement left him.  Is making love a
	crime?  Of course not -- but the
	question isn't as simple as that.
	Rebecca Lawson used her seductive
	qualities to entice Andrew Marsh.
	She used sex as a catalyst and
	cocaine as the terminus.  The
	combination of the two provided the
	conclusion of a premeditated act.
		(beat)
	She asked Dr. Paley about cocaine.
	Her fingerprints were found on the
	nasal spray bottle that contained the
	cocaine -- and she was the sole
	beneficiary of Andrew Marsh's will.
	She planned it from beginning to end.
	She knew about his heart.  She
	secretly administered cocaine, then
	used wild and physically demanding
	sex to induce a heart attack.
		(beat)
	Making love is an act of passion
	between two people to affirm their
	vows of love.  This was not an act of
	love -- this was an act of greed.
	This was betrayal.  Rebecca Lawson
	killed Andrew Marsh -- and I'm
	counting on you to punish her for
	that crime.


INT.  WAITING ROOM, COURTHOUSE - DAY

Dulaney sits on one side of the room -- Rebecca on the other.
The room is quiet -- tense.  A MAN enters and nods to him.

		DULANEY
		(to man)
	They're back already?  It's only been
	three hours.



								96

INT.  COURTROOM - DAY

Dulaney sits beside Rebecca.  In the row behind them is Sattler
and Biggs.

The JURY enters.  Their faces betray nothing.  One by one they
file into their seats.

Cardenas sits with Troxell -- both of them watching anxiously.

		JUDGE BURNHAM
	Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
	have you reached a verdict?

The JURY FOREMAN stands.

		JURY FOREMAN
	We have, Your Honor.

The BAILIFF walks over and takes the VERDICT SLIP from the
FOREMAN, then walks over to Judge Burnham and hands it to him.
Judge Burnham reads the decision.  He hands it back to the
Bailiff who takes it to the COURT CLERK.

ON REBECCA

She waits nervously for the Court Clerk to read the verdict.

ON CARDENAS

he taps his pen against the desk anxiously.

ON THE COURT CLERK

He opens the verdict slip and looks at it.  He stands slowly.

		COURT CLERK
	The jury finds the defendant -- not
	guilty.

Relief floods Rebecca's face.  Dulaney shows no emotion.
Sattler and Biggs shakes hands, then lean forward to
congratulate Dulaney.

Rebecca turns to Dulaney to hug him -- before she can, Dulaney
has picked up his briefcase and is leaving the courtroom.


INT.  UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON

Dulaney walks towards his car with Biggs.  There is no sense of
victory or elation.

		BIGGS
	What are you gonna do now?

								97


		DULANEY
	Take some time off.

		BIGGS
	You think the D.A.'s gonna file on
	Joanne?

		DULANEY
	I don't know.

Dulaney reaches his car.

		DULANEY
	You did a good job, Charlie.

		BIGGS
	Thanks, Mister D.

Biggs walks away.  Dulaney takes out his keys, opens the door
to his car.  He is about to get in when he senses someone
behind him.  He turns around.

Joanne steps out from behind a pillar.  She stares at Dulaney
hatefully.  Her hand is inside her purse.

		JOANNE
	That bastard should have left me
	something.  I worked for him for six
	years -- and he goes and gives it all
	to her.

Dulaney looks around the parking lot.  He is alone.  Joanne is
obviously very high on something.  Her mind seems to wander,
her eyes drift.

		JOANNE
	You take what people say and make it
	ugly.  You make others believe what
	you want them to.  She should have
	been found guilty.  She shouldn't
	have gotten off.

		DULANEY
	Then you would have gotten your
	money?

		JOANNE
	Yes.

		DULANEY
	You killed him -- didn't you, Joanne?


								98

		JOANNE
	Do you think if I did I'd be stupid
	enough to tell you?

Dulaney looks her hand fidgeting in her purse.

		DULANEY
	What do you have in your purse?

		JOANNE
	What do you think I've got?  A gun?
	Maybe I'm gonna kill you too.  Maybe
	I'll blow your head off right now.

Her hand starts to come out of the purse.  Suddenly, Biggs
appears, rushing her from behind a pillar.  He grabs her hand
and pushes her against a car.

He pulls her hand from the purse.  She is holding a piece of
paper.

		JOANNE
		(crying)
	I'm gonna go to jail.  I know they're
	gonna make it look like I did it.
	They gotta put it on someone.

		DULANEY
	Why'd you come here?

		JOANNE
		(holds up the letter)
	To show you this.  It's a letter from
	that lawyer, Koehler.  He wrote it to
	me the day after I saw him.  He's the
	one who told me I could get the money
	if Miss Lawson went to jail.

		DULANEY
	You didn't know about it before that?

		JOANNE
	No.

Dulaney is suddenly very confused.

		DULANEY
	Then why did you go see Mr. Koehler
	in the first place?

		JOANNE
	Because he called me.

Dulaney is stunned.  He looks at Biggs with a knowing stare.


								99


EXT.  HOUSE - EVENING

It is RAINING lightly.  Dulaney waits at the door of a nice two
story home.  It is answered by a heavy-set man in his fifties,
JOSEPH KOEHLER.

		DULANEY
	Hi, Joe.

		KOEHLER
	Frank -- what are you doing here?

		DULANEY
	I need to ask you a question.  What
	made you get in touch with Joanne
	Braslow?

		KOEHLER
	You know I can't talk about that.

		DULANEY
	I'm not asking for names or
	specifics.  I just want to know what
	prompted you to make the call?

		KOEHLER
	Sorry.

Koehler starts to close the door, Dulaney sticks his foot
inside, blocking it.  His face is filled with determination.
Koehler sees it.

		DULANEY
	Please -- I need your help.

Koehler thinks for a moment.  He can sense Dulaney's need.

		KOEHLER
	All I can tell you is I was contacted
	by an interested party on Miss
	Braslow's behalf.


INT.  DULANEY'S CAR - NIGHT

Dulaney stares through the windshield, straining to see the
road through the heavy rain.  His CAR PHONE RINGS.

		DULANEY
	Hello?

		REBECCA (VO)
	Frank -- It's Rebecca.  I need to see
	you right away.  I've got the tape.

								100


A calmness spreads over his face.

		DULANEY
	I'll be right there.


EXT.  REBECCA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

RAIN FALLS.  LIGHTNING fills the sky.  Dulaney drives up --
finds a PARKING SPOT down the street --  gets out of his car
and runs to the door.  As he KNOCKS as loud CLAP on THUNDER
BOOMS overhead.  Dulaney waits impatiently.  He lifts the
FLOWER POT, removes the key and opens the door.


INT.  DEN - NIGHT

The dim glow of a DESK LAMP is the only source of light.
Dulaney moves through the room slowly.

		DULANEY
	Rebecca?

Two CHAMPAGNE BOTTLES are on the floor by the couch.  Dulaney
looks on the coffee table.

HIS POV - COFFEE TABLE

A VIAL is open and on its side.  A RAZOR BLADE and STRAW lay
next to it.  A pile of WHITE POWDER has been dumped out.
Several lines of cocaine have been drawn.

Dulaney starts to move towards the living room.  He is almost
at the door when the BIG SCREEN TELEVISION TURNS ON.  We see
the tape of Dulaney and Rebecca making love.

		REBECCA (OS)
	Is this what you're looking for,
	Frank?

Dulaney turns around to find Rebecca standing behind him, a
remote control in her hand.

		DULANEY
		(distant)
	You killed him.  You killed him --
	and I got you off.

		REBECCA
	That's crazy.


								101

		DULANEY
	Is it?  Joanne Braslow was perfect,
	wasn't she?  You knew we'd see her on
	the tape and find out about her coke
	problem.  After that, the digging
	should have been easy -- but we
	missed the will.  You knew we were
	following her, so you called Koehler
	and had him contact her.  That put us
	right back on track.  All we needed
	then was to prove that she had an
	opportunity.  The drug store took
	care of that.  She dropped off the
	stuff and you came back and killed
	him.  Didn't you?

She shrugs her shoulders.  His frustration clearly amuses her.
She grins slightly, almost taunting him.

		DULANEY
	I want the tape.

Dulaney starts into the living room.

		REBECCA
	I've been thinking about that.  I've
	decided to give it to you after I've
	collected the inheritance.  You can
	take that one if you want -- but
	there's another copy.

		DULANEY
	That wasn't the deal.

		REBECCA
		(provoking him)
	So, sue me.
		(as cold as ice)
	Things have changed.  I think you
	should go home -- and after you leave
	I see no reason for us to ever have
	contact again.

		DULANEY
		(growing angrier)
	I'm not leaving without that tape.

		REBECCA
	Don't push me, Frank.  I might lose
	my temper and send it out just for
	spite.

Dulaney loses control.


								102

		DULANEY
	You fuckin' bitch!

He grabs her by the shoulders and pushes her into the wall.
Rebecca struggles, but it is little use -- he is a man consumed
with rage.  Dulaney continues to smash her into the wall.

Rebecca reaches onto the desk -- lifts up a FOUNTAIN PEN and
stabs it into Dulaney's shoulder at the base of his neck.
Dulaney SCREAMS and lets go.  Rebecca starts to runs into the
living room.  Dulaney follows.


INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Dulaney catches Rebecca -- grabs her -- spins her around --
then backhands her across the face, knocking her to the ground.
In the b.g. the VIDEO of them in bed plays on the screen.
Dulaney sits on top of her and grabs her by the hair.  He
repeatedly smashes her head onto the floor.

		MAN'S VOICE
	Let her go!

Dulaney stops.  He looks behind him.

HIS POV

Standing in the bedroom doorway is Dr. Paley.  He is holding a
GUN at Dulaney.

Dulaney stares at him with disbelief as he staggers to his
feet, his hand holding the wound on his shoulder.  A short,
breathless LAUGH drifts out of Dulaney as he starts to put it
all together.  Rebecca stands up, holding her head as she tries
to catch her breath.

		DR. PALEY
		(to Rebecca)
	Are you alright?

Rebecca NODS.  Her face hardens.

		REBECCA
	You've got to kill him, Alan.

		DR. PALEY
	What?


								103

		DULANEY
	She's right, Paley.  You've got to
	kill me.  She doesn't have to --
	she's free -- she can't be tried
	again -- but you, you planned it with
	her.  You supplied the Coke.  You're
	an accessory to murder.

		REBECCA
	Shoot him.

Paley struggles to make a decision.  The gun shakes in his
hand.  Suddenly, the whole scheme becomes clear to Dulaney.

		DULANEY
	Don't you see what she's doing?  She
	needs you to kill me.  She's planned
	it that way from the start.  That's
	why she phoned me tonight.

		DR. PALEY
	You called him?

		REBECCA
	No -- he's lying.

		DULANEY
	How's it supposed to work Rebecca?
	You and Paley celebrate your victory.
	You get me over here and provoke a
	fight so he has to rush in and save
	you -- but then he's given himself
	away as your accomplice -- now he has
	to kill me.
		(to Paley)
	After that I figure she'll tell the
	Police that you broke in.  That you
	were crazed because we humiliated you
	in court?

		REBECCA
	Don't listen to him.  Can't you see
	he's trying to turn you against me.

								104


		DULANEY
		(continuing; to
		 Paley)
	Here's the good part.  The truth dies
	with me and she turns State's
	evidence against you.  It won't
	matter what you say.  No one will
	believe your version -- you've
	already discredited yourself in
	court.  You'll go away forever and
	she'll have the money all for
	herself.  She's played us both
	perfectly.

Paley is becoming more and more confused.  Dulaney moves
towards him.  Paley lowers the gun slightly.

		REBECCA
	Alan, listen to me.  If you don't
	kill him it's over.  Everything we
	did will be for nothing.

		DR. PALEY
	Shut up, Rebecca.

		DULANEY
	She's good isn't she?  But maybe with
	you it's the real thing.
		(points to the
		 screen)
	I'm sure all those nights she was
	fuckin' me she was thinking of you.

Confusion crowds Paley's mind.

		DULANEY
	I'm sure that every orgasm she had
	with me was faked.

		DR. PALEY
	That's enough.

		DULANEY
	I mean she only screwed me two or
	three times a night because she had
	to -- I'm sure she didn't enjoy it.

		REBECCA
		(softly)
	I love you, Alan.  You have to
	believe I love you.  Kill him!  Kill
	him and we can be together forever!


								105

		DULANEY
	That's right, she loves you.  Just
	like she loved Roston and Marsh and
	me.  Don't be a fool.  You're nothing
	to her.  The second you pull that
	trigger she'll turn on you.

Betrayal fills Paley's face.  His eyes fill with tears.

		DR. PALEY
		(to Rebecca)
	I loved you.

		REBECCA
		(tense)
	Alan, don't let him do this.  You're
	everything to me.
		(she moves closer)
	Give me the gun.  Give me the gun and
	I'll do it for you.

Paley stares at her -- his mind races.  Pain fills his face as
he fights to make a decision.  Suddenly, his face tenses.  He
starts to raise the gun at Dulaney -- then just as suddenly he
turns it on Rebecca and FIRES.

The bullet hits Rebecca in the chest.  The force blows her off
her feet.

Paley stares at her blankly.  He slowly lowers the gun and
drops it to the floor, then staggers over to Rebecca.

ON REBECCA

she stares up through glazed, dead eyes.

Paley takes her pulse.  He breaks down, weeping over her body,
his tears signaling to Dulaney that she is dead.


EXT.  REBECCA'S HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT

Police cars are lined up outside, their RED LIGHTS FLASHING.


INT.  REBECCA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Members of the POLICE FORCE, along with FORENSIC PEOPLE go over
the area.  Dulaney sits on the couch.  He looks indifferent --
as if all emotion has been sucked out of him.  Troxell is
beside him, taking notes.  Dulaney looks up.

A BODYBAG on a stretcher is being wheeled out of the room.


								106

Dulaney follows it with his eyes.  Cardenas enters from the
bedroom.  They lock eyes.

		CARDENAS
	Paley's confessed to the whole thing.
	It's like he's got no will to live
	now that she's gone.
		(thinks for a moment)
	She almost got away with it.  Ironic,
	huh?  Do you believe in karma, Frank?

Dulaney doesn't answer.

		CARDENAS
	Well -- call it what you want.  Fate.
	Destiny.  We usually get what we
	deserve in the end.

A beat.  Dulaney looks at him wearily.

		DULANEY
	Can I go?

		CARDENAS
		(to Troxell)
	You get his statement?

		TROXELL
	Yeah.

		CARDENAS
	Then you can go.

Dulaney gets up and starts for the door.  Cardenas watches him.

		CARDENAS
	Frank?

Dulaney turns around slowly.  Cardenas reaches into his
RAINCOAT pocket and take out a VHS TAPE.

		CARDENAS
	I found this video in her room.  It
	has your name on it.

The two men lock eyes.  There is a long silence between them.
Dulaney waits for Cardenas' next move.

		CARDENAS
		(holding it out)
	I assume it's yours.

Dulaney knows that Cardenas has seen it.  A hint of a grateful
smile shows on his face.  He takes the tape.


								107

		DULANEY
	Thanks.


EXT.  REBECCA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A light RAIN falls.  Dulaney walks out and heads towards the
street.  He stops -- looks back at the condo -- then walks down
the street towards his car.
