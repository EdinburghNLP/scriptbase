Arthur is a rich, alcoholic playboy with no regards to his working life.
After another drunken run-in with the law, his aloof mother has had enough and forces him to marry Susan, a proper business woman, or else he will lose his inheritance.
Just as he's engaged to Susan, he meets Naomi, a free-spirited girl who Arthur thinks is perfect for him.
Any attempts at holding down a job are fruitless, so Arthur has to decide, what is more important: love, or his mother's money.
