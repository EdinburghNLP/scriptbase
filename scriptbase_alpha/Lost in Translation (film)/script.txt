               FADE IN:

               EXT. NARITA AIRPORT - NIGHT

               We hear the sound of a plane landing over black.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CHARLOTTE'S ROOM - NIGHT

               The back of a GIRL in pink underwear, she leans at a big 
               window, looking out over Tokyo.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Melodramatic music swells over the Girl's butt in pink sheer 
               underwear as she lies on the bed.

               INT. CAR - NIGHT

               POV from a car window - the colors and lights of Tokyo neon 
               at night blur by.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               In the backseat of a Presidential limousine, BOB (late-
               forties), tired and depressed, leans against a little doily, 
               staring out the window.

               P.O.V. from car window- We see buildings covered in bright 
               signs, a billboard of Brad Pitt selling jeans, another of 
               Bob in black & white,looking distinguished with a bottle of 
               whiskey in a Suntory ad... more signs, a huge TV with perky 
               Japanese pop stars singing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. PARK HYATT - NIGHT

               Bob's black Presidential (looks like a 60's diplomat's car) 
               pulls up at the entrance of the Park Hyatt, a modern sky 
               rise.

               The automatic doors open on the car, as Bob gets out.   Eager 
               BELLHOPS with white gloves approach at the sight of the car, 
               welcoming Bob and helping him with his bags.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PARK HYATT - NIGHT

               Bob stands in the back of a crowded elevator surrounded by 
               Japanese businessmen below his shoulders.

               The elevator stops at the 50th floor and the doors open onto

               the massive, streamline lobby of the Park Hyatt.

               Bob follows the JAPANESE BUSINESSMEN out into the marble and 
               glass lobby that frames the view of Tokyo.

               The CONCIERGE and several eager HOTEL MANAGERS greet Bob. He 
               just wants to sleep, but more STAFF continue to greet him, 
               ask him about his fright. They lead him to reception.

               INT. HOTEL RECEPTION - NIGHT

               At the reception area four JAPANESE BUSINESSMEN and two WOMEN 
               quickly sit up from their seats on sight of Bob, and extend 
               handshakes and gifts. They bow and introduce themselves from 
               the commercial company, extend name cards and welcome him 
               enthusiastically.

               More staff welcomes him and offer their service during his 
               stay.

               One of them presents a fax that has come for him.

               INSERT -

               "TO: BOB HARRIS

               FROM: LYDIA HARRIS

               YOU FORGOT ADAM'S BIRTHDAY.

               I'M SURE HE'LL UNDERSTAND.

               HAVE A GOOD TRIP, L"

               He doesn't know what to do with it, and stuffs it in his 
               pocket.

               The commercial people tell him when they'll be picking him 
               up, and ask if he needs anything else.

               Some JAPANESE ROCK STARS with shag haircuts and skinny leather 
               pants pass by. Each commercial person has to shake Bob's 
               hand before leaving.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BOB'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Bob sits on the end of the bed in a too small hotel kimono.

               INT. PARK HYATT BAR - NIGHT

               Bob sits at the bar. A few minutes pass as he sits in silence 
               looking around, drinking a scotch.  Chet Baker sings "The 
               Thrill is Gone" over the stereo.

               We see Bob's POV of tables of people talking. JAPANESE WOMEN 
               SMOKING, AMERICAN BUSINESSMEN tying one on, talking about 
               software sales. A WAITER carefully setting down a coaster, 
               and pouring a beer very, very slowly. It's all very foreign.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BOB'S HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

               The automatic hotel curtains open, pouring light into the 
               room.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT.HOTEL BATHROOM - DAY

               Bob gets in the shower overlooking the view of Tokyo. The 
               shower head is at his elbows, he raises it as high as it 
               goes, and leans down to have a shower. This hotel was not 
               designed with him in mind.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. STUDIO - DAY

               Whiskey commercial shoot.

               The set is full of activity as the JAPANESE CREW work. Bob, 
               in a shawl collared tuxedo sits at a European style bar set 
               with a cut crystal glass of whiskey. A JAPANESE GIRL quickly 
               powders his face as they adjust lights and the DIRECTOR and 
               crew speak in hurried Japanese.

               The Director (with blue contact lenses) says a few long 
               sentences in Japanese.

               TRANSLATOR, a middle-aged woman in a coordinated outfit, 
               translates but it is only a short sentence now.

                                     TRANSLATOR
                         He wants you to turn, look in camera 
                         and say the lines.

               Bob wonders what she's leaving out, or if that's the way it 
               works from Japanese to English.

                                     BOB
                         That's all he said?

                                     TRANSLATOR
                         Yes, turn to camera.

               Bob thinks let's just get it over with.

                                     BOB
                         Turn left or right?

               The Translator blots her face with a tissue, and asks the 
               director in a Japanese sentence 5 times as long. The Director 
               answers her in a long excited phrase.

                                     TRANSLATOR
                         Right side. And with intensity.

                                     BOB
                         Is that everything? It seemed like 
                         he was saying a lot more.

               The excited Director says more in Japanese. Translator nods 
               in understanding. Bob doesn't really know what's going on.

                                     TRANSLATOR
                         Like an old friend, and into the 
                         camera.

                                     DIRECTOR
                              (to Bob))
                         Suntory Time!

               They get ready, and roll camera:

               Bob turns and looks suavely to the camera:

                                     BOB
                         For relaxing times, make it Suntory 
                         Time.

               The Director yells something about ten sentences long. The 
               translator nods.

                                     TRANSLATOR
                         Could you do it slower, and with 
                         more intensity?

                                     BOB
                         Okay.

               The Translator answers for him in four sentences.

               ON THE MONITOR - we see the next take: the moody lighting 
               shines on Bob, the camera gets closer as he stares into camera 
               and gives them the line.

                                     BOB
                         For relaxing times, make it Suntory 
                         Time.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. TOKYO - NIGHT

               Shinjuku High rises sparkle.

               INT. PARK HYATT BAR - NIGHT

               Tall glass walls show the neon and high-rises of the city.

               A sad and romantic Bill Evans song plays. Bob sits alone 
               with a scotch at the bar.

               Some drunk AMERICAN BUSINESSMEN, with their ties thrown over 
               their shoulders recognize him.

                                     BUSINESS GUY
                         Hey- you're Bob Harris- you're 
                         awesome, man.

                                     ANOTHER BUSINESS GUY
                         Yeah, I love Sunset  Odds! BOB Oh, 
                         Ok, thanks.

                                     BUSINESS GUY
                         Man, that car chase-

               Bob  nods.

               INT. BOB'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Bob comes back to his room. The maids have left everything 
               perfect, his beige bed is turned down, and the TV has been 
               left on to a channel playing a montage of flower close-ups 
               in nature while sad violin music plays. It's supposed to be 
               relaxing, but it's just sad.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Bob lies in bed. He flips through TV channels from the remote 
               control.  He passes a Japanese game show, to an 80s Cannon 
               Ball run-type movie with him in it dubbed into Japanese. He 
               turns it off as he hears a knock at the door.

               He goes to the door, and opens it part way.

                                     WOMAN (O.C.)
                              (Raspy Japanese voice)
                         Mr. Harris?

                                     BOB
                         Yes?

                                     WOMAN
                         Mr. Kazuzo sent me.

                                     BOB
                         Oh?

                                     WOMAN
                         Can I enter?

               He pauses, then opens the door.

               A WOMAN in her forties in a short tight leather mini skirt 
               and stockings comes in. She is wearing '60s style make-up.

               Bob sits on the bed not sure what to do as he watches her.

               Bob's POV - We see her back to us as she puts a CD on the 
               stereo - it begins to play: Serge Gainsberg and Brigitte 
               Bardot sing "Bonnie & Clyde".  The woman turns slyly around 
               and shimmies over to Bob.

                                     WOMAN
                              (as she tries to 
                              undress him)
                         Mr. Harris?

                                     BOB
                         Yes?

                                     WOMAN
                         Do you like massage?

                                     BOB
                         I don't think so.

                                     WOMAN
                         Mr. Kazuzo send Premium Fantasy.

               She pushes him back onto the bed. He hesitates, but then 
               goes along with it passively.

                                     WOMAN
                         My stockings.

                                     BOB
                         Yes?

                                     WOMAN
                         Take them.

               He fumbles with her stockings, trying to do as she says.

                                     WOMAN
                         No - Lip  them... Don't touch me!

               He takes his hands back confused.

                                     WOMAN
                         Lip my stockings! 

               He backs away, as he tries to understand her.

                                     WOMAN
                         Lip them! 

               She throws her leg up to him on the bed.

                                     BOB
                         Huh?

               She pantomimes ripping them. He finally understands.

                                     BOB
                         Oh, you want me to rip them?

               He pulls at her stockings trying to rip them, but they just 
               snap.

               She pretends to struggle.

                                     WOMAN
                         Please let me go!

               He pulls his hands away. She grabs them and puts them back 
               on her, and keeps struggling dramatically. They wrestle around 
               awkwardly, her pretending to try to get away, but not letting 
               him go. She rips her stockings and falls off the bed in fake-
               defense.

                                     WOMAN
                         Let me go! 

               She pulls a confused Bob down on top of her. He doesn't know 
               what she wants.

               She rips another stocking and pins him on the ground. He 
               tries to crawl away, she grabs his leg and trips him. He 
               grabs a nearby table leg as he falls, the lamp crashes to 
               the floor, the room goes black.

                                     BOB
                         I think you should leave.

               In the harsh sunlight of the big windows Bob eats breakfast 
               alone. Next to him is a table of TEXANS in cowboy hats. At 
               another table a JAPANESE COUPLE in sunglasses chain smoke 
               and drink coffee.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOTEL ELEVATOR - DAY

               Bob gets into the ded elevator. He is stopped momentarily by 
               the Concierge who asks him if everything is fine for his 
               stay.

               In the elevator Bob's surrounded by JAPANESE BUSINESSPEOPLE 
               and a FAMILY dressed for a wedding.

               Across, at the other side of the elevator he sees CHARLOTTE, 
               a pretty Ivy-league girl in her mid-twenties, and the only 
               other Westerner in the elevator. Her honey-colored hair stands 
               out in the crowd.

               She's looking at him like you do when someone new comes in 
               the elevator, but the Japanese look straight ahead at the 
               elevator doors.

               Charlotte and Bob look at each other across the Japanese 
               heads. She smiles, from one foreigner to another. The door 
               opens and she gets out with the crowd. Bob watches her leave.

                         Mr. Harris

               He is approached by a group of eight excited people from the 
               commercial company there waiting to take him.

                                     PRESS AGENT

                              way)
                         We just got a request from Tanabe 
                         Mori-he is the Johnny Carson of Japan! 
                         It is a big honor to be invited to 
                         his show.

               Bob feigns enthusiasm briefly.

                                     MISS KAWASAKI
                         Can you stay until Friday?

                                     BOB
                         I'll have to see about that.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PHOTO STUDIO - DAY

               Bob's back is to us as a MAKE-UP ARTIST is putting some final 
               touches on him. The PHOTOGRAPHER is giving her enthusiastic 
               direction in Japanese. Bob talks on his cell phone, not paying 
               attention to the make-up artist.

                                     BOB
                         Can you get me on a flight Thursday 
                         night?

                                     ELAINE (O.S.)
                         We're looking into it Bob, but they 
                         really want you to stay to do that 
                         talk show Friday, apparently it's a 
                         really big deal, he's the Johnny 
                         Carson of Japan.

                                     BOB
                         Yeah, they told me.

                                     ELAINE (O.S.)
                         These people are paying you a lot, 
                         do you think you could consider it?

                                     BOB
                         Just get me out of here as soon as 
                         you can.

                                     ELAINE (O.S.)
                         Ok, you're scheduled to leave 
                         Saturday, but we'll hold a seat 
                         Thursday in case, but first class is 
                         full, you're waitlisted for an 
                         upgrade... there might be a seat on 
                         Lufthansa...

                                     BOB
                         Oh, great. I'll talk to you later, 
                         bye.

               He hangs up. The make-up artist dusts him with powder.

               The commercial people are crowding around. Bob's chair is 
               swivelled around and we see him in his tuxedo, wearing too 
               much make-up and some weird looking eyeliner.

               In front of a grey backdrop, moody lighting is being adjusted 
               and Bob is handed a bottle of Suntory.

               small documentary crew moves in on Bob with a video camera- 
               the camera man is tilting the camera at his face in arty 
               dutch camera moves.

               The agency people crowd around. The photographer is excited 
               and urges Bob to do dumb poses, he won't do.

                                     PHOTOGRAPHER
                         Can you put hands close to face.

               The photographer demonstrates a dramatic pose with his hands 
               at his face.

                                     BOB
                         Urn, I don't think so. How bout I 
                         just hold the bottle.

               The photographer starts shooting. Bob obviously hates the 
               whole thing, what you do for money.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PARK HYATT BAR - NIGHT

               Bob, still in his tuxedo and make-up from the shoot, sits 
               alone having a drink. A JAZZ BAND FROM SAUSALITO performs. 
               The SINGER is a middle-aged woman with red wavy hair, dressed 
               in red, and takes her singing very seriously. She sings a 
               slow version of "Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme".

               C.U. - a golden beer is poured very slowly.

               Bob drinks his scotch, hoping it will all go away.

               Across the bar, Charlotte sits with JOHN, her husband (he is 
               in his late twenties and sloppy in a fashionable way), and 
               some FRIENDS - super stylish, weird Japanese fashion people 
               (all smoking). One of them, CHARLIE, in a shiny suit, keeps 
               taking pictures, and showing them magazine layouts.

                                     JAZZ SINGER
                         Thank you. We're glad to be here, 
                         we're Sausalito.

               Charlotte laughs and looks down, the Japanese audience clap 
               very seriously... she and Bob catch eyes - about Sausalito 
               and how weird it is there.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ELEVATOR - LATER

               The mirrored elevator doors close and Bob sees himself close-
               up in the elevator's mirrored walls - noticing the heavy 
               makeup and weird eyeliner from the shoot which he had 
               forgotten about. He looks at himself.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Charlotte lays close to her young husband, John. She looks 
               to see if he's awake, but he's sleeping soundly. She leans 
               her chin on his shoulder.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Are you awake?

               He doesn't answer.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         John?

               He grumbles something, opens one sleepy eye to look at her, 
               and grabs her under the covers. He kisses her.

                                     JOHN
                         Go to sleep.

               He holds her close, but she can't sleep.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Charlotte sits on a ledge looking out at the big buildings. 
               The sun is starting to come up. Below she watches cars going 
               places.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BOB'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Bob lies in bed awake. The clock says 4:20.

               The in-room fax machine is making noise as a fax rolls in. 
               Bob looks at the fax machine but doesn't get out of bed.

               The fax curls and falls to the floor.

               CLOSE ON FAX -

               "BOB-

               QUALITY TIME WITH THE CONSTRUCTION CREW. HOPE YOU'RE HAVING

               INT. HOTEL GYM - NIGHT

               The gym is empty except for an old man vacuuming. Bob passes 
               piles of little towels and bottles of water. He takes a water 
               for his workout.

               He approaches an exercise machine and puts the water in the 
               drink holder of the machine. He looks at the lit-up 
               instruction panel'99 it is all in Japanese.

               He pushes a button, and the machine starts beeping, then a 
               soothing woman's voice recites instructions in Japanese.

               He gets on it, and sinks. He tries to make the arms and foot 
               peddles coordinate. He pushes a button and it starts moving 
               too fast. In an upward rotation he tries to reach the control 
               panel, but is not fast enough. The soothing woman's voice 
               continues instruction.(she occasionally includes an English 
               word- gently,   gently...vigorous)   He tries to keep up 
               with it, and tries again to push the right button to slow it 
               down, but the machine steps starts going swiftly backwards 
               instead.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PARK HYATT LOBBY (GROUND FLOOR) - DAY

               The agency group wait for Bob. They stand up as he approaches 
               from the elevator, trying to mask a slight limp.

                                     BOB
                              (everything's fine)
                         Good morning.

               Miss Kawasaki notices his limp with concern as they leave 
               the hotel.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SHIBUYA STATION - DAY

               Charlotte gets out at shibuya station, a crowded neighborhood 
               filled with neon, ads, and people.

               She looks up at the huge intersection as tons of JAPANESE 
               PEOPLE wait to cross the street, no one steps forward until 
               the cross-walk light changes, and all of them cross.

               A TV screen covering a building plays commercials.

               She roams around the narrow streets, crowded with stylish 
               JAPANESE KIDS, tan SCHOOLGIRLS pass her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Charlotte wanders down a crowded street, looking around.

               On a small side street she stops at a little park. She watches 
               a JAPANESE MAN AND WOMAN together:

               CHARLOTTE'S POV -

               C.U. The man reaches his hand to the back of the woman's 
               neck, and leans in close. The woman smiles at him, in love.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               John is sound asleep. Charlotte is awake next to him. She 
               looks at the clock - it's three a.m.

               She slides close to him, kisses his mouth. He grumbles 
               something in his deep sleep, and rolls over.

               She goes to the couch, stepping over camera equipment.

               She looks at the fruit basket, decides to try an apple. She 
               has a piece but isn't really hungry.

               She reaches over some proof sheets and looks at a magazine, 
               but she's already looked at it a few times before. She decides 
               to go downstairs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PARK HYATT BAR - NIGHT

               Bob sits alone at the bar. Charlotte sits down a seat away 
               from him, lost in his thoughts, he doesn't see her until he 
               turns and finds her next to him. They look at each other. A 
               young BARTENDER with a sweet face tends to them.

                                     BARTENDER
                         What can I get you?

                         I'm not sure.

                                     BOB

                         'Suntory time'!

               Charlotte smiles at him sympathetically

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         What are you doing here?

                         My wife needs space, I don't know my 
                         kids ' birthdays.  Everyone wants 
                         Tiger Woods, but they could get me, 
                         so I'm here doing a whiskey 
                         commercial.

               She looks at him.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Oh.

               She lifts a cigarette, he lights it for her.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I'll just have a beer.

               He makes small talk about the pickled seaweed breakfast and 
               jet lag, they commiserate about having not slept in days.

                                     BOB
                         What about you? Why are you here?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         My husband's here for work-he's a 
                         photographer- and I just came 
                         along...I'm not really doing anything 
                         right now, and we have some friends 
                         who live here.

                         Try twenty-five.

                         You're probably just having a mid-
                         life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?

                                     BOB
                         I'm thinking about it.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         25 years... that's a long time... 
                         Are you still in love with your wife?

                                     BOB
                         Yes... I don't know, I don't know 
                         her anymore. I don't know if you can 
                         be in love with one person the whole 
                         time. I was... actually I was in 
                         love with her sister first, when I 
                         was twenty-one. And one day her sister 
                         said to me she wanted to move to 
                         Paris, so I said okay, and she said 
                         no, she wanted to move to Paris with 
                         Francois,   and she's still married 
                         to him. And I moved in with Lydia... 
                         but I always really liked Lydia.

                              info)
                         Oh.

                                     BOB
                         What do you do?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I'm not sure, yet... I graduated 
                         last spring.

                         Oh, what do you do with that?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I don't know, but I can think about 
                         it, a lot.

                                     BOB
                         It takes a while to figure it out. 
                         I'm sure you will, though.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis 
                         will work out,too.

                                     BOB
                         Thanks.

               They clink glasses.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I wish I could sleep BOB Me, too.

               INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

               The hotel is filled with business people. A dressed up FAMILY 
               is going to lunch. We follow a jet-lagged Charlotte and John, 
               as they walk down the lobby hall.

               An energetic blonde actress, KELLY, pops up to them. (She's 
               carrying a copy of Memoirs of a Geisha.)

               John, who was holding Charlotte's hand, drops it.

                                     KELLY
                         John! What are you doing here?

                                     JOHN
                         I'm just here shooting this band, 
                         what about you?

                                     KELLY
                         Promoting that action movie I did...

               She does a karate chop and laughs.

                                     KELLY
                         ...doing like twenty million 
                         interviews a day... It's soo good to 
                         see you. How long are you here for?

                                     JOHN
                         We're here for the week. I'm shooting 
                         in Osaka for a few days.

                                     KELLY
                         It's amazing  there!

                                     JOHN
                         Have you met Charlotte? My wife.

                                     KELLY
                         No!  Hi! So great to meet you!

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Hi, nice to meet you.

                                     KELLY
                         You know, John, you're my favorite 
                         photographer, I only want to be shot 
                         by you.

               Charlotte looks at John.

                                     JOHN
                         Uh..thanks.

                                     KELLY
                              (as she fans out her 
                              top)
                         Sorry if I have the worst B.O., I've 
                         been sweating in this little room 
                         with T.V. lights for hours...

               Kelly, giggling and acting all too comfortable with herself, 
               is eating up all the oxygen around them.

                                     JOHN
                         Oh no...

                                     KELLY
                              (with a big smile)
                         ...Well, I have the worst  headache, 
                         I have to go find some aspirin. But, 
                         call me, let's have a drink, I'm 
                         under Evelyn Waugh.

               Kelly giggles. Charlotte smirks.

                                     JOHN
                         Ok, see you later.

               And Kelly and her make-up artist and publicist are off. John 
               and Charlotte continue.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Evelyn Waugh?

                                     JOHN
                         What?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Evelyn Waugh was a man.

               John shrugs.

                                     JOHN
                         Oh, c'mon, she's nice.  Not everyone 
                         went to Yale.

               Charlotte shoots him a look.

                                     JOHN
                         Its just a pseudonym, it doesn't 
                         matter.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Why do you have to defend her?

                                     JOHN
                         I'm not, but do you have to point 
                         out how stupid everyone is.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         No, I thought it was funny. Forget 
                         it.

               His producer comes up to them. John puts his arm around 
               Charlotte, kisses her, everything's fine.

                                     PRODUCER
                              (looks at his watch)
                         We should get going.

                                     JOHN
                         OK, I'll see you later.

               He kisses her on the cheek, and is gone.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Bob watches a Japanese BUSINESSMAN swimming, he looks like 
               an over-grown baby.

               Bob swims laps in the pristine pool.

               He continues his laps. Under water he sees the jumping legs 
               of MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN.

               A disco mixed tape starts, and above water we see a WESTERN

               Charlotte lies on the floor with big headphones on, listening 
               to a book on tape. After a corny music intro, a very serious 
               scholar man's voice speaks clearly :

               DR. KENGARD (0.S.) Did you ever wonder what your purpose in 
               life is? This book is about finding your soul's purpose or 
               destiny. Every soul has its path, but sometimes that path is 
               not clear.  The acorn theory is an example of each soul 
               beginning with an imprint....

               Charlotte tries to get into it, but can't get past feeling 
               like a loser listening to a self-help tape. She looks at the 
               doctor's photo on the audio-book box, he's bald, in a 
               turtleneck and glasses.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOTEL - DAY

               Charlotte follows a JAPANESE FAMILY in formal dress out of 
               the elevator onto the mezzanine level. She wanders down a 
               big hall.

               She sees an open door and steps in the crowded room, which 
               is in the midst of a press conference. Cameras flash as Kelly, 
               with wide eyes, behind a table, answers questions 
               enthusiastically.

               KELLY You know, barbecuing, and yoga, and I love taking my 
               dogs, Buster and Lulu, for walks on the beach... and it was 
               great learning karate for "Midnight Racer" - I did all my 
               own stunts!

               The JAPANESE JOURNALISTS seem excited by her answer.

               Kelly throws a Karate punch for a PHOTOGRAPHER.

                         What was it like working with Keanu 
                         Reeves?

                                     KELLY
                         It was great. I've known him for a 
                         while now- you know we both live in 
                         L.A. We both have dogs...

               Charlotte walks out.

               INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY

               Charlotte continues down a hall, she stops at an open door 
               and peeks in.

               A quiet group of JAPANESE WOMEN are gathered around a table. 
               Charlotte goes in, as she gets closer she sees they are being 
               instructed in Ikebana floral design. Each woman has a little 
               vase and elegant flower cuttings. She watches as they 
               delicately arrange the tiny flowers.

               The INSTRUCTOR hands Charlotte a vase and cuttings. Alongside 
               the women, Charlotte tries to follow along.

               INT. CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL - BATHROOM

               Charlotte reclines low in the bathtub staring off. She can 
               see mount Fuji in the distance.

               The audio tape plays on the stereo.

                         image that is your inheritance, your

                         continually being selected by your

               INT. CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - EVENING

               With her back to us, Charlotte looks out the big window.

               John comes up and kisses her.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         How'd it go today?

                                     JOHN
                         Good...I'm tired.

               He hugs her for a moment, leaning on her.

                                     JOHN
                         I gotta go meet Kelly for a drink 
                         downstairs. She wants to talk about 
                         some photo thing.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you.

                                     JOHN
                         You wanna come?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Sure.

                                     JOHN
                              (doesn't really want 
                              her to)
                         Ok.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PARK HYATT BAR - NIGHT

               At a corner table Charlotte sits with John, Kelly, and DJ 
               CLEAN, a skinny kid in a sweatshirt, on tour in Japan.

               Charlotte is bored while Kelly talks on.

               Sausalito performs in the background.

                                     KELLY
                         ...My Dad was anorexic.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         (she's never heard of that)
                         Really?

               John shoots Charlotte a look.

                                     KELLY
                              (very serious)
                         He was on the American side at the 
                         Bay of Pigs, in Cuba, and he was 
                         taken prisoner, and they tortured 
                         them about their food the whole time.

                                     BENZO
                         Where?

                                     KELLY
                         My dad fought on the American side 
                         at the Bay of Pigs. So, when he was 
                         a prisoner, they would tell them 
                         they had put poison in their food 
                         and they would make themselves throw 
                         up... and when he got back, he did 
                         better, but he still has food issues. 
                         He has to have really clean food.  
                         And really simple. He can't just go 
                         have, say, Chinese food.

                                     JOHN
                              (trying)
                         Oh, that's too bad.

               Charlotte ashes her cigarette in a clean ashtray, and she 
               watches as it is quickly replaced with a new one by a WAITER.

                                     BENZO
                              (nodding at the view)
                         How crazy is this shit?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Yeah, it is.

               DJ Clean starts doing a human beat box at her.

               Charlotte looks over at Kelly.

                                     KELLY
                         ...Oh my god you have to try it, 
                         this power cleanse is amazing- it's 
                         lemon juice and grade B maple syrup 
                         and cayenne pepper for seven days. 
                         Just like a half a teaspoon of 
                         cayenne. The first few days you're a 
                         little scattered, but by day four - 
                         it's amazing... my eyes were so 
                         white...

               Charlotte excuses herself.

               She passes Bob who sits at his usual spot at the bar, as she 
               is leaving.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Hi again, how's it going?

                                     BOB
                         Who do I have to fuck to get off 
                         this planet?

               Charlotte laughs with sympathy, but doesn't know what to 
               tell him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               John sleeps soundly (turned away from her), Charlotte can't 
               sleep. She turns on the T.V. to a crazy local T.V. variety 
               show.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT BOB'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Bob can't sleep, he watches the same show on T,V.

               He flips the channel- it's an old black & white Japanese 
               movie of a man committing Hari Kari.

               FADE IN:

               EXT. TOKYO - MORNING

               Charlotte finds her way down a narrow street in an old section 
               of Tokyo.

               She turns a corner and finds a square with what she was 
               looking for.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. TEMPLE - DAY

               The sun shines over a beautiful old temple. Birds chirp, 
               Charlotte approaches and goes inside.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. TEMPLE - DAY

               Charlotte stands in the back and watches a ceremony.

               A ROSHI speaks in Japanese, monks chant. It's all very 
               foreign.  Charlotte tries to feel something.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - AFTERNOON

               Charlotte sits on the bed talking to John who's coming out 
               of the bathroom, getting ready to go to work. He checks 
               himself in the mirror, CHARLOTTE Am I shallow?

                                     JOHN
                         No, what are you talking about.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I went to a temple today and I didn't 
                         feel anything.

                                     JOHN
                         That's ok.

               He looks for his mobile phone.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I don't know what to do.

                                     JOHN
                         That's ok, you'll figure it out.

               He comes close and kisses her.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You smell weird.

                                     JOHN
                         What?

               She leans back to look at him.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Like popcorn?

                         I got some hair stuff.

               She looks at him funny.

                         I gotta go to work.

               He grabs her, kissing her good-bye, she wraps her him, when 
               his cell phone rings.

                                     JOHN
                         I'll be right down...I'm just 
                         leaving...ok.

               He kisses her, and leaves.

                                     JOHN
                         See you later.

                         It's cool... but,I don't know... I 
                         went to a shrine today and all these 
                         little monk's were chanting... and, 
                         I didn't feel anything... I even 
                         tried ikebana, ...   and John's using 
                         hair products... I don't know who 
                         I—.

               Lauren's Call-waiting beeps, cutting off her sentence.

                                     LAUREN
                         Oh, wait, can you hold on one sec?

                         Sure.

               Charlotte waits.

                         Sorry about that, what were you 
                         saying?

               In the background a baby starts crying.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Oh, it's nothing... I better go, 
                         I'll talk to you later.

                                     LAUREN
                         Ok, have fun there, you're so lucky 
                         you don't have any kids yet and you 
                         can go off to Japan... call me when

                         Ok, bye.

               She hangs up. She sits there for a moment, starting to cry, 
               she wipes the tears, trying to make them go away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SUBWAY - AFTERNOON

               Tokyo goes by out the window. Charlotte looks at the PEOPLE 
               on the crowded train. A sweaty BUSINESSMAN blots his face 
               with a little handkerchief.  Another older BUSINESSMAN reads 
               an erotic comic book.

               INT. SUBWAY STATION - AFTERNOON

               Charlotte looks up at the many signs, trying to figure out

               which way to go, but they are all in Japanese characters. 
               Confused, she chooses the west exit.

               EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON

               Charlotte walks down a little street in a quiet neighborhood.

               She stops at a window of a portrait studio and looks at all 
               of the wedding portraits. They are very formal and retouched, 
               Japanese brides and grooms dressed in a Western old-fashion 
               style.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ARCADE - DAY

               Charlotte looks through the window as a tan Japanese boy, 
               tries to win a stuffed animal for his girlfriend.

               INT. ARCADE - AFTERNOON

               In a crowded arcade, Charlotte watches some kids play Dance 
               Revolution, a video game where you dance along to cues on 
               the

               light-up floor. One BUSINESSMAN in a suit is really good and 
               into it.

               She sees a sushi chef game where you have to cut an electronic 
               fish.

               She looks at a firefighter game, and rows of plexi boxes 
               filled with some little character dolls you try to win.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GALLERY BOOKSTORE - DAY

               Charlotte looks at the shelves of books she passes, she flips 
               through some books.

               She walks over to a small gallery space and goes up to the 
               wall to see the small photos.

               They are of tied-up, partially naked Japanese school girls, 
               one girl is spanking another one with a stuffed animal. She's 
               making a face of ecstacy.

               Charlotte looks at it, not getting it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SHIBUYA - DAY

               Charlotte stands alone on a side street, smoking a cigarette 
               and watching the CROWDS go by.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SHIBUYA - DAY

               Charlotte walks up a little street filled with shops.

               She stops at a window of cute underwear that she.looks at. 
               She goes into the shop.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

               51C.U. Charlotte's lips. She puts watermelon color lipstick 
               on.She looks at herself in the mirror in her new underwear.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               We hear the shower running in the bathroom.

               Charlotte decorates the room, putting up some paper cherry 
               blossom decorations.

               She goes over to the bed and stubs her toe on it, as she 
               flops down.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Ouch.

               She holds her toe, annoyed with her klutziness.

               John talks to her from the shower.

                                     JOHN (O.C.)
                         At the fitting, they had all these 
                         rock n roll clothes, the label guys 
                         kept saying lock n loll, though, but 
                         the band doesn't look tough at 
                         all...they look better just skinny 
                         and nerdy, like how when they came 
                         in...they looked so uncomfortable in 
                         these Keith Richards clothes, they 
                         should just be like they are, don't 
                         you think?

               She's drifted off.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Yeah.

                                     JOHN
                         Yeah, I think you're probably right... 
                         because when you try to...

               He gets out and is rushing to get his stuff together to go. 
               Charlotte's lounging on the bed in her new pink underwear.

               She tries her scarf on that she's been knitting.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Do you think it's done?

                                     JOHN
                         I don't know.

               He goes to get all his stuff together.

               He passes an ashtray with cigarette butts in it.

                                     JOHN
                         Will you please stop smoking?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         But I like to... and I don't smoke 
                         that much.

                                     JOHN
                         Its bad for you.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Ok, I will... later.

               He picks up a camera from a table in the corner. He looks at 
               the self-help audio book box.

                                     JOHN
                         A Soul's Search: Finding Your True 
                         Character and calling? Is this yours?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Oh... that's nothing, someone gave 
                         it to me.

                                     JOHN
                         You don't have to be embarrassed.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm 
                         not into it.

                                     JOHN
                         It's ok if you are.

               He kisses the side of her face and her shoulder like a cute 
               pet, and then continues getting his stuff together.

               John sets two bottles of Cristal on the bed next to her, not 
               really seeing her.

                                     JOHN
                         Oh, the record company sent these...

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.

                                     JOHN
                         I gotta go... and I don't really 
                         like champagne.

               As he unplugs his cell phone from the wall.

                                     JOHN
                         Are you sure you want to stay?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Are you sure you have to go?

               He looks at her - like don't make it harder.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Yeah, I know you have to work the 
                         whole time, I'll probably have more 
                         fun here. I'll call Charlie and those 
                         guys.

                                     JOHN
                         Ok, definitely call them, I'll be 
                         back Friday. I love you.

               They kiss.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I love you.

               He tackles her, kisses her, bites her, grabs her ribs, 
               tickling her in a burst of affection. She laughs, her arms 
               around his neck.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I miss you.

                                     JOHN
                         It'll just be a few days.

               He kisses her and is off.

               Charlotte sits there alone with the unopened bottles of 
               champagne.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PARK HYATT POOL - EVENING

               Water splashes as Charlotte dives into the pool (in a one-
               piece bathing suit) as the sun goes down.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               INT. PARK HYATT HALL - EVENING

               Leaving in her robe, Charlotte runs into Bob, in his robe, 
               going to the pool.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Oh, hi.

                                     BOB
                              (awkward, but glad to 
                              run into her)
                         Hi. Did you have a nice swim?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Yeah. Did you get some sleep?

                                     BOB
                         No, how about you?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Not really. How long are you here 
                         for?

                                     BOB
                         I'm here for the week.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Oh, good. Do you want to go to a 
                         party tonight with me and some friends 
                         who live here?

                                     BOB
                         Ok.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         See you later.

               He watches her go.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BOB'S ROOM - EVENING

               As Bob opens his door to his room, a FedEx package falls in 
               his path.

               He opens it - large carpet swatches fall out with a note

               "BOB - WHICH ONE DO YOU WANT FOR YOUR STUDY? I LIKE THE 
               BURGUNDY, BUT WHATEVER YOU WANT. LOVE, L"

               He looks at them for a second, they all look the same, and 
               why is she sending these? He puts them down.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               The elaborate chiming doorbell rings.

               Charlotte opens the door to see Bob. He's wearing an orange 
               camouflage T-shirt. She looks at his shirt, suppressing a 
               smile.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You really are having a mid-life 
                         crisis.

                                     BOB
                              (embarrassed)
                         I know, it's stupid.

               He goes into the bathroom to change it. He comes out with it 
               on inside out so it's just an orange T-shirt.

               He asks her to cut the label out for him. She goes to find 
               some scissors. He picks up A Soul's Search: Finding Your 
               True Calling audio-book box.

                                     BOB
                         A Soul's Search: Finding Your True 
                         Calling - are you reading this?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         No.

               She returns with the hotel room sewing kit.

                                     BOB
                         I read it, too.

               She smiles, busted, but doesn't say anything as she cuts his 
               shirt label with little hotel sewing-kit scissors.

               She slips on her shoes on to leave.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. TOKYO BAR - NIGHT

               All white nightclub, lit with black lights so it seems to 
               glow in the dark, with the booming sound of helicopters. 
               JAPANESE GALLAGER BROTHERS walk by.

               Bob watches Charlotte as Charlie, in a crazy outfit, hugs 
               her.  Charlotte tries to talk to Bob over the loud music.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Charlie, this is Bob. Bob — Charlie 
                         Brown.

                                     BOB
                         Hi, Charlie.

               They shake hands.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         His real name's Hayashi, but someone 
                         started calling him Charlie because 
                         they thought he looked like Charlie 
                         Brown. They've all got American 
                         nicknames because its easier for me 
                         to remember... they were just out in 
                         L.A. last month doing a shoot with 
                         John... that guy's Mr.Valentine, 
                         he's the art director of their 
                         magazine, I don't even know his real 
                         name, or why I call him that.

               Bob looks over at some SKINNY GUY in huge glasses smiling at 
               them. Charlie hands them some drinks.

                                     CHARLIE
                         This is Bambi.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Hi.

               A young SHY GUY with a shaved head smiles at her, and takes 
               her picture.

               A JAPANESE KRAFTWERK COVER-BAND plays Trans Europa Express.

               Some people at the bar buy drinks for Bob and insist on 
               drinking with him.

               Bob and Charlotte look over as Charlie gets into some problem 
               with the BARTENDER.  The Bartender gets mad and starts 
               shooting a real-looking BB gun at him. Orange bullets fly 
               through the air. They all rush out of there.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BAR - NIGHT

               Bob and Charlotte try to get past the crowd at the entrance. 
               A big BOUNCER stops them and is yelling fast Japanese at 
               him.

               The crowd parts as the Bartender emerges shooting his BB 
               gun, and Bob and Charlotte run for it.

               BB GUN CHASE -

               The Bartender climbs on a car, threatening them from above. 
               Bob covers Charlotte as they duck behind the car.

               They make a run for it, ducking into a pachinko parlor.

               INT.PACHINKO PARLOR - NIGHT

               Bob and Charlotte run past the blinking machines, and 
               gamblers, to another door to the street.

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               Bob spots a cab and they run to it, seeing Charlie now 
               throwing bottles in the direction of the bartender.

               Bob and Charlotte get in the cab.

               INT. CAB - NIGHT

               Charlotte hits her head as they get in. Bob yells to the 
               driver to go, but he doesn't understand.

               Through the windshield they see the Bartender and sidekick 
               coming with baseball bats.

               They hear a bang on the door and Charlie hops in. He makes 
               sure she is ok and shouts something to the Driver, and they 
               speed away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT

               Charlie, in his flashy outfit, sings "God Save the Queen" 
               into the Karaoke mic. He rolls his r's just like Johnny 
               Rotten.

               Charlotte laughs and loves watching Charlie. They're other 
               friends wear the different color wigs they provide at this 
               place. There are big bottles of beer and sake.  They are all 
               pretty formal. Bambi tries to talk to Charlotte with a big 
               grin, he can barely speak English.

                                     BAMBI
                         How's california?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (smiles)
                         Good.

                                     BAMBI
                         Good... I like your swimming pool.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Thanks, you guys should come back 
                         sometime.

                                     BAMBI
                         Yes.

               He tries wigs on her. He puts a light pink wig on her and 
               beams. Bob smokes and watches.

                                     BAMBI
                         Kawaii.
                              (Kawaii means "cute")

               She smiles a lovable smile at Bambi.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Charlie and Charlotte sings "Brass in Pocket" by The 
               Pretenders ("you're special, so special..."), everyone is 
               drunk now, as they all sing along at the chorus. WOMEN keep 
               refilling the glasses.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Mr. Valentine sings a popular slow heartfelt Japanese song 
               that everyone knows and sings along to. Charlotte and Bob 
               look at each other, it is very foreign, but Bob likes being 
               there with Charlotte and her friends.

               She flips through a big binder of songs.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         What do you feel like singing, Bob?

                                     BOB
                         No way.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Bob sings "I fall to Pieces" to Charlotte. Charlie and 
               everyone cheers for him.

               Beer pitchers are replaced. Charlie starts singing "Angle". 
               The little room is fxlled with smoke, Charlotte makes her 
               way to the door to get some air.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KARAOKE BAR HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Taking a break from the crowded and hot Karaoke room, 
               Charlotte sits for a break alone on a bench in the bright 
               hallway. It is quiet with just the muffled sound of music 
               from the Karaoke room. She's wearing a pink geisha wig. Bob 
               sits down next to her.

               Charlotte lights his cigarette with some crazy Japanese light-
               up lighter.

               She leans her head back - it's getting too heavy.

               She looks at his hands.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You bite your nails?

               He nods.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I could cut the ones that are left 
                         for you.

                                     BOB
                         Ok.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. NOBU'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

               NOBU, a cool skinny stoner guy in a Hawaiian shirt, plays 
               phsycadellic records in his seventies hippie surfer-pad.

               His JAPANESE  GIRLFRIEND, who looks like a 60's pin-up,   
               pours cold sake.

               Bob is  handed a ridiculously big bong.

               Charlie is drunk and taking polaroids.

               Nobu, really stoned, talks to Bob about surfing.

               A SHORT GUY with thick glasses introduces himself to 
               Charlotte, extending his hand.

                                     HANS
                         I'm Hans.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Hans?  Nice to meet you.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Charlie takes pictures of Charlotte and HIROMIX, a sexy 
               Japanese girl, posing on a sheepskin run. They are being 
               hammy for Charlie who loves it.

               Bob walks up and is amused watching her, she sees him and 
               gets embarrassed.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DECADENT TOKYO PARTY - NIGHT

               Hiromix dances — Charlotte dances with Hans - she looks sweaty 
               but beautiful... Bob dances with his eyes closed, really 
               into it, in the midst of all of them... the song "I Feel Too 
               Young" plays.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. NOBU'S ENTRY - NIGHT

               Bob and Charlotte are leaving Nobu's. She's wearing Bob's 
               jacket.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Make sure she gets home okay?

                                     BOB
                         I will.

               Bob takes Charlotte's arm carefully just as she bangs her 
               head walking into the glass door - it makes a loud thud.

                                     BOB
                         Are you ok?

               She nods. Bob looks back at Charlie who is watching- she's 
               fine.

               He leads her into a waiting cab.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               POV from cab - Tokyo neon blurs by. It looks beautiful.

               INT. CAB - NIGHT

               Charlotte looks at the neon going by. She looks over at Bob, 
               her eyelids are too heavy for her.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I don't want to go home.

                                     BOB
                         I know. I don't either.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOTEL HALL - NIGHT

               Bob carries a very drunk Charlotte to her room. Her purse 
               dangling from his arm.

               INT. CHARLOTTE'S ROOM - NIGHT

               He puts her on her bed. He takes her shoes off for her and 
               pulls a blanket over her.

               He looks at her lying on the bed.

               She opens her eyes to smile at him. He wants to kiss her, 
               but he leaves.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT.HOTEL HALL - NIGHT

               He walks down the empty hall, not wanting to leave her.

               As he goes he looks at various trays of leftover room service 
               in the hallway.

               INT. BOB'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Bob comes back to his room, tripping over the carpet samples.

               He makes a phone call from bed. He's still a little drunk 
               and thinking about his night out in Tokyo.

                                     BOB

                         He was this fashion guy, and there 
                         were all these Japanese fashion people-
                         it's a whole other world, and I was 
                         talking to these Japanese surfers...  
                         He was playing all this great music-

                         Well, you have to have something for 
                         breakfast. Do you want cereal?

               He hangs up.

               Charlotte can-'t get out of bed. She looks at the clock-

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Thanks for getting me back in one 
                         piece.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                                     BOB (O.S.)
                         Of course.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Do you want to have some breakfast?

               C.U. her hand wraps the phone cord around her fingers.

                                     BOB (O.S.)
                         Yeah, I'm going to take a shower and 
                         I'll meet you downstairs.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         OK, see you downstairs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - DAY

               They sit in the bright light. She squints and drinks a Bloody 
               Mary. Bob is distant.

               She looks across at two middle-aged MID-WESTERN WOMEN talking 
               about plastic surgery, you can't hear them, but can tell as 
               they gesture and one pulls her eye lids up.

               Charlotte looks at another table by the elaborate buffet and 
               sees the redhead Singer having breakfast with the rest of 
               Sausalito.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (trying to make it 
                              light)
                         Hey look, it's Sausalito.

                                     BOB
                         I see them every morning.

               They don't know what to say. Somehow it's too intimate having 
               breakfast. She eats her breakfast aware of her every movement.

               C.U. - her POV of soft scrambled eggs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY

               In the distance, Bob swings on a perfect golf course.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               INT. CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Charlotte lies in bed awake. The clock says its 4 a.m.

               Finally she gives up on trying to sleep, and turns the light 
               on. In John's old T-shirt and Ugg boots, she goes to the 
               couch, looks at some strange pastry with an elaborate 
               presentation left by the hotel.

               She picks up a magazine, but she's already looked at it a 
               few times before. She hears something and goes over to the 
               door. On her way, she passes her red T. Anthony suitcase 
               overflowing with stuff that looks like a bomb went off in 
               it.

               A HOTEL MESSAGE envelope is slipped under the door. She opens 
               it to see a typed note from the operator:

               "From: Mr. Harris. Message: Are you awake?"

               She smiles like she's gotten a valentine.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BOB'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Bob opens the door, Charlotte's standing there trying to 
               look casual, she's happy to see him (she's put some pants on 
               and flip flops instead of her dumb looking Ugg boots).

               She knocks into a low table, bumping her knee as she comes 
               in.

               Bob pours some cold sake, smoothly.

               Bob and Charlotte watch La Dolce Vita with Japanese subtitles 
               on the TV.

                                     BOB
                         Hans was very attentive to you.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I think he kind of liked me...Is 
                         that so hard to imagine?

                                     BOB
                         No, its easy.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         How'd a Japanese guy get a name like 
                         Hans?

                                     BOB
                         I don't know.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Charlotte gets up to pour more sake.

               She picks up and looks at a prescription bottle on his night 
               stand and reads the label : Lipitor.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Do you remember when we met at the 
                         bar? ...You were wearing a tuxedo.

                                     BOB
                         But the first time I saw you was in 
                         the elevator.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Really?

                                     BOB
                         Yeah, you don't remember?

               She shrugs.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Did I scowl at you?

                                     BOB
                         No, you smiled.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I don't remember.

                                     BOB
                         I know, I kind of blend in here.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Why do they switch the r's and l's 
                         here?

                                     BOB (O.C.)
                         I don't know. My fax said "have a 
                         good fright".

                                     CHARLOTTE (O.C.)
                         Let's never come here again, because 
                         it would never be as much fun.

                                     BOB (O.C.)
                         Ok, whatever you want.

                         with Bambi?

                                     BOB (O.C.)
                         No, I was looking at you.

                                     CHARLOTTE (O.C.)
                         Oh.  Well... they were dancing on 
                         the couch with that weird English 
                         guy who kept talking about hanging 
                         out with the Sex Pistols on Kings 
                         Road...

                         I got a fax today from your friend 
                         Hiromix.

                         Oh, for her show?

                                     BOB (O.C.)
                         No, for a candlelight dinner, yes, 
                         for her show.

                         I know.

                         I'm stuck. Does it get easier.

                                     BOB
                         No, yes, it does...

                         Yeah? But look at you.

                                     BOB
                         Thanks. It does, the more you know 
                         who you are... you don't care about 
                         things the same way...

                         to be. I thought maybe I wanted to 
                         be a writer... but I hate what I 
                         write, and I tried taking pictures, 
                         but John's so good at that, and mine 
                         are so mediocre... and every girl 
                         goes through a photography phase, 
                         like horses, you know dumb pictures 
                         of your feet...

                         You'll figure it out. I'm not worried 
                         about you. Keep writing.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         But, I'm mean.

                                     BOB
                         That's ok.

                         And marriage, does that get easier?

                                     BOB
                         It's hard. We started going to a 
                         marriage counselor.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Did that help? Did you learn anything?

                                     BOB
                         We established that we have no 
                         communication.

                         Oh.

                         We used to have fun, she used to 
                         like to go to places with me for my 
                         movies and we would laugh at all the 
                         weirdos, but now she's tired of it 
                         all. She never wants to leave the 
                         kids, she doesn't need me, and they 
                         don't need me, I feel like I'm in 
                         the way. It gets complicated when 
                         you have kids... that changes 
                         everything.

                         That's too scary.

                         When they're born its like Vietnam. 
                         It's terrifying.

                         after they can talk, and can do things 
                         with you.

                         That's nice. My parents were always 
                         traveling, they weren't around so 
                         much.

                         In D.C., my dad was the Ambassador 
                         to France in the eighties, so we 
                         went to school in Paris for a few 
                         years... but we mostly lived in D.C., 
                         and they were never around... and 
                         then I moved to Los Angeles when 
                         John and I got married... it's so 
                         different there.

               They are starting to get tired.

                         John thinks I'm so snotty.

                                     BOB
                         You are.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I know, but that's what you like 
                         about me.

               She looks over at him. He does like her.

                         Why do you have to be with your 
                         opposite, why cant similar people be 
                         together?

                                     BOB
                         Because that would be too easy.

               They fall asleep dressed, on top of the sheets, on opposite 
               sides of the bed.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               EXT.STREET BASKETBALL COURT - DAY

               Full of life, Bob plays basketball with some local guys.

               All over the court, and towering over the other players, Bob 
               dominates the game.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BOB'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

               Bob looks at himself in the bathroom mirror, he feels his 
               stubble and sees that it's turning grey.

               He opens the hotel shaving kit. He squirts shaving cream 
               from the child-size can. Even the razor is small. He covers 
               his face with shaving cream when the phone rings.

                                     BOB
                         Hello?

                                     RECEPTION
                         Mr. Harris, we have fax for you!

                                     BOB
                         Ok.

                                     RECEPTION
                         Do you want I send it to your room?

                                     BOB
                              (sarcastic)
                         Great.

                                     RECEPTION
                         Thank you, Mr. Harris.

               He hangs up and shaves.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOTEL GROUND FLOOR LOBBY - DAY

               Bob gets out of the elevator- the Suntory group is waiting 
               for him. He ducks behind a wall and sneaks out a side entrance 
               of the hotel.

               EXT. PARK HYATT - DAY

               Bob comes out of the hotel into the sunlight. The street is 
               crowded with MOTORCYCLE GANGS going by, one waves a big flag.

               Bob watches the strange scene in the street for a moment, 
               and then makes his way past.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. DAKINYAMA - DAY

               He walks down a little street in a more old-fashioned 
               neighborhood. He's wearing new techno sneakers. He makes a 
               call on his cell phone.

                                     BOB
                         Miss Kawasaki? It's Bob Harris... 
                         I'm not going to be able to do that 
                         interview today.., yeah... ok.... 
                         Yes, I'd love to stay to be on his 
                         talk show... sure.. ok... bye.

               A light rain starts as he looks at a fax from Charlotte with 
               a map she's drawn and tries to figure out where he is - there 
               are no street signs.

               EXT/INT. ICHICAN SUSHI - DAY

               Bob finally finds the small restaurant. The automatic door 
               opens for him, and Charlotte, at the bar with the cute chubby 
               SUSHI CHEF, turns to Bob happy to see him. He is disheveled 
               from the rain and adorable.

               He sits down next to Charlotte, she pours him a beer and 
               orders for him.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You made it.

                                     BOB
                         They really have to work on that 
                         street name thing.

               A perky recording voice says "Kornichiwa!" from his pocket.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         What's that?

               He pulls a pink Hello Kitty watch from his pocket.

                                     BOB
                         It's for my daughter.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         How old is she?

                                     BOB
                         Four.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Oh, she'll love it.

               The Sushi Chef gives him perfect little pieces of sushi on a 
               banana leaf.

               Charlotte takes a bite of a piece - but it won't break, so 
               she has to stuff the whole thing in her mouth, embarrassed. 
               Bob makes fun of her gracelessness.

                                     BOB
                         Nice one.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (mouth full)
                         Fuck off.

               They have lunch, he makes her laugh.

               He looks down at her feet in flip flops, her toe is purple.

                                     BOB
                         What happened to your toe?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I don't know, I think maybe I broke 
                         it? I knocked into something the 
                         other day...

               She slips her shoe off and shows it to him- her middle toe 
               is black and blue.

                                     BOB
                         That doesn't look good.

               She enjoys the sympathy.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         It's bad isn't it?

                                     BOB
                         We should get you to the doctor.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You think so?

                                     BOB
                         Yeah, look at that thing.

               She smiles at him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. DAIKANYAMA STREET - DAY

               Bob tries to get a taxi, finally one stops and they get in. 
               He tries to explain "hospital", he does pantomime, draws a 
               first aid cross, but the DRIVER doesn't understand. Charlotte 
               is enjoying Bob's effort.

               Finally he finds a Park Hyatt matchbook and calls the hotel 
               number.

                                     BOB
                         How do you say "hospital" in Japanese?

                         One moment, please.

               She transfers call, it rings.

                                     BOB
                         Yes, can you tell me how to say 
                         "hospital" in Japanese?

                                     CONCIERGE

                         Hosupitari? 

               He tells the Driver who looks at him funny. Bob says it again-
               faster, with a Japanese accent. The driver nods excitedly 
               and drives off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT.HOSPITAL LOBBY - DAY

               Bob and Charlotte walk in, looking around at where to go.

               Bob talks to a woman at the desk to explain what they need.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Bob takes a seat in waiting area as Charlotte goes into a 
               little room with a number on it.

               Bob waits next to a 100 year old lady.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Charlotte stands alone barefoot on a little box, wearing a 
               lead apron, as a MAN and ASSISTANT X-ray different angles of 
               her foot.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Bob looks around at all the Japanese gift stuff, and buys a 
               little stuffed bunny. His phone rings as he's paying for it.

                                     BOB
                         Hello?

                         Oh, hi, Elaine.

                                     ELAINE (O.S.)
                         So, we got you on an earlier flight, 
                         but I really think you should think 
                         about staying for that talk show.

                                     BOB
                         Ok.

                         Yeah, I'll stay.

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

               Charlotte's foot X-rays are displayed on a big light box. An 
               older DOCTOR talks about them in Japanese to his younger 
               ASSISTANT as he wraps Charlotte's toes together. She doesn't 
               know what they're talking about.

               INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - DAY

               Charlotte comes out where Bob waits with the little stuffed 
               bunny.

               Bob and Charlotte arrive back at the massive hotel, they 
               stroll in casually, she is carrying the stuffed rabbit in 
               her arm.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Bob reclines in the big Japanese wooden tub, steam rises as 
               he is turning red. His phone rings. He dries his hands quickly 
               to reach it before it stops ringing.

                                     BOB

                         (O.S.) It's really hard to reach 
                         you... Did you get the carpet samples? 
                         I like the burgundy.

                                     BOB
                         Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost.

                         It's just carpet.

                         That's not what I'm talking about.

                         I don't know... I want to be more 
                         healthy. I want to eat better.

                         Not all that pasta.

                         Like Japanese food.

                         Why don't you just stay there, and 
                         you can have it everyday.

                                     BOB
                         Oh, come on.

                         I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe, 
                         I'll talk to you later. Are you going 
                         to be Ok?

                                     BOB
                         Yeah, I'll be fine. Bye.

               INT. CAR - NIGHT

               Bob rides in the back of a cab.

                                     CHARLOTTE (V.O.)
                              (voice-mail message)
                         Hi Bob, it's Charlotte... how are 
                         you doing today?... I'm going to 
                         meet Charlie and those guys at this 
                         place called Orange around ten... 
                         come meet us if you get this...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

               Bob's cab pulls up at an empty office building.

               INT. OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

               Bob looks at a fax from Charlotte with a map, wondering if 
               he's in the right place. It's quiet and looks like a generic 
               office building.

               He goes in the little metal elevator, and the door opens on 
               the 8th floor onto a little nightclub you would have never 
               thought was there.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ORANGE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

               Lights strobe and Peaches' seedy "Fuck the Pain Away" booms 
               through the speakers.

               Tan JAPANESE STRIPPERS with platinum hair dance and hang 
               from a pole on a little platform.

               Bob sits alone on a brown ultra suede couch feeling out of 
               place and empty.

               He looks over at a table of young AMERICAN INVESTMENT BROKERS. 
               He wishes he wasn't there, but tries to seem comfortable.

               Charlotte shows up with Charlie and the other guys. She sits 
               down next to him, and gives him an 'are you going to kill 
               me?' look.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         How long have you been here?

               He looks at her like it's been forever. She smiles for 
               forgiveness.

               They look over and see a WEIRD GUY in the corner getting a 
               lap dance, they look at each other, sharing the joke of the 
               place, but both uncomfortable about the sexuality of it.

               Through a beaded curtain, Charlie and Bambi get lap dances 
               in a dark corner of pillows.

               Charlotte looks at Bob.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         C'mon, let's go.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. TOKYO STREETS - NIGHT

               Bob and Charlotte go up to a cab, but the driver refuses 
               them. They don't know why, but just make their way down an 
               empty side street. Little plastic cherry blossom decorations 
               hang above them.

                                     BOB
                         Where's your husband?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (like she's said it a 
                              million times)
                         Working.

                                     BOB
                         Do you ever see him?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (sorta)
                         Yeah.

                                     BOB
                         Do you know where we are?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         No.

               She puts a coin in a vending machine and takes a cold sake 
               "one-cup". A tiny brad Pitt head smiles at her next to an 
               iced coffee.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Isn't it weird there are no street 
                         names in Tokyo... you'd think a city 
                         like this would have street names... 
                         you need a map to get anywhere... 
                         look, there are no signs...

               They keep walking, small figures on a little empty street.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               INT. PARK HYATT LOBBY - NIGHT

               As they make their way back, they pass a lounge off the lobby. 
               It's late, it's pretty empty,  a housekeeper vacuums and 
               just a SLEEPING MAN sits in the back of the lounge, and a 
               snuggled up romantic JAPANESE COUPLE sit close to: Kelly, 
               the blonde actress, singing to them.

               She stands facing them with a karaoke mic singing "Nobody 
               Does It Better" with all her heart.

               Bob and Charlotte look at each other and keep walking (trying 
               to be invisible).


               FADE IN:

               INT.CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

               Charlotte lies in bed. She picks up a photo next to the bed 
               as she dials the phone.-

               The picture is of her and John on their honeymoon. The phone 
               answers - it's a weird Japanese recording.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Um..Hi, John, if this is your phone? 
                         I'm not sure...I'm going to go to 
                         Kyoto for the day...I'11 try you 
                         when I get back. Hope it's going 
                         good... I love you, bye.

               INT. TRAIN - DAY

               Charlotte watches the Japanese countryside go by out her 
               window.

               EXT. KYOTO - DAY

               Charlotte walks through a beautiful garden. She's a small 
               figure in the landscape.

               She approaches a temple where she stops to watch a wedding 
               procession. A young bride and groom in traditional kimono 
               walk under a parasol with their family.

               Charlotte looks as- the nervous, young bride clutches her 
               mother's hand. The young groom walks along with them.

               Charlotte is moved by the whole scene, the beauty of the 
               temple and the wedding party. Her eyes well up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               She walks up a narrow path, surrounded by red maple leaves.

               At the top of a little hill, she comes up to a shrine.

               At its entrance she sees a tree covered in little white pieces 
               of paper tied to its branches. She sees Japanese people 
               writing on the paper and tying them to the tree. Charlotte 
               writes her wish on a paper and ties it to a branch.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. T.V. STUDIO - DAY

               Exciting music plays as the talk/game show starts.

               Bob, in an elegant suit, goes out to meet the HOST.

                                     TV HOST
                              (in Japanese)
                         We hear you're quite a golfer.

               A TRANSLATOR translates.

                                     BOB
                              (nodding)
                         I enjoy the sport.

               The Translator translates - four sentences longer and with 
               added enthusiasm.

               After a few questions the Host excitedly announces something 
               to the AUDIENCE in Japanese. They scream, the lights flash, 
               Bob has no idea what's going on.

               A cloud of smoke reveals the IRON CHEF, with feathered hair, 
               wearing an 18th century waistcoat.  A large red chef hat is 
               placed on Bob's head.

                                     TRANSLATOR
                         They now have the competition for 
                         you with the Iron Chef.

               Bob looks around as a counter is pulled up to him and now 
               Bob and the Iron Chef are at dueling counters. The Host barks 
               instructions in Japanese, an apron with a stuffed animal 
               lobster on it is tied around Bob, the crowd cheers - there's 
               no way out.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAR - NIGHT

               Bob rides in the back of the presidential, looking out the 
               window at the city.

               He pulls a polaroid out of his pocket and looks at it. It's 
               Charlotte, peering over her shoulder with a little smile, 
               from their sake-drenched night at Nobu's compound.

               INT. PARK HYATT BAR - NIGHT

               Melodramatic '70s Japanese music plays. Bob sits alone, hating 
               himself, at the bar. The redheaded Jazz Singer takes a break, 
               and a seat next to him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BOB'S ROOM - MORNING

               In the harsh-morning light, Bob wakes up in his bed.

               He hears the Jazz Singer singing in the shower "Midnight at 
               the Oasis".

               Her red mane of hair passes frame as she ushers in room 
               service. She seems to have taken over the whole room. He 
               wants it all to go away. She walks off to the bathroom and 
               there's a knock at the door. Bob rushes to get it before she 
               can.

               He opens the door a crack, Charlotte looking sweet, is 
               standing there. Her hair is back in a pony-tail. Bob's just 
               wearing a towel around his waist, and his hair is sticking 
               up.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Rough night?

               He's not in the mood, he looks at her like he already hates 
               himself, doesn't need more help.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I'm going to Daikanyama, do you want 
                         to come walk around?

                                     BOB
                         Yes, but no, I can't right now.

               The singer starts singing again in the background.

               Charlotte gives Bob a look.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Oh, I guess you're busy, huh.

                                     BOB
                         I don't want to be.

               He watches Charlotte walk away down the beige hall.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Bob is walking down the crowded street looking for Charlotte, 
               when his cell phone rings.

                                     BOB

                         I couldn't hear you. How are you?

                                     LYDIA
                              (sighs)

                         What?

                         Zoe, come say hello to your father...

               A little girl's voice shouts "No!" in the background.

                                     LYDIA (O.S.)
                         I guess she's busy.

                         Ok.

               In the background the daughter calls for her Mommy over and 
               over and a dog starts barking.

                                     LYDIA (O.S.)
                         Ok, well, travel safely. See you 
                         soon.

                                     BOB
                         Bye.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ICHICAN SUSHI RESTAURANT - DAY

               Charlotte, with sunglasses on, leans against the wall as Bob 
               approaches.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan 
                         after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?

                                     BOB
                         No, we'll find something around here.

               She goes with him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SHABU SHABU RESTAURANT - DAY

               Bob and Charlotte are seated at a big booth in a corny Shabu 
               Shabu restaurant.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         The Jazz singer? The red-head?

               Bob looks at her like- don't make it worse.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Well, I guess she's more around your 
                         age...  You guys could talk about 
                         things in common, like growing up in 
                         the fifties.

                                     BOB
                         You're a brat, wasn't there anyone 
                         else around to lavish you with 
                         attention?

               She scowls at him.

               The waitress brings them drinks- she pours beer slowly, and 
               turns on a pot on the table to cook their food.

               Charlotte looks at the menu - it is filled with photos of 
               different trays of meat. The waitress doesn't speak English.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I can't tell the difference?

               They have trouble ordering, but point to a picture on the 
               menu.

                                     BOB
                         We'll have two of these.

               He makes some small talk, she is bugged.

                                     BOB
                         What do you want to drink?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         A coke.

               He orders the drinks.

                                     BOB
                         So, where'd you go today.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Around.

               "This is the End" by The Doors starts playing on the stereo. 
               The waitress brings two huge trays of sliced raw beef. Steam 
               rises from the pot on the table.

               The song ends, and another Doors song comes on.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         They're not going to play the whole 
                         album, are they?

               They look across the table, over the steam and meat, at each 
               other- the whole thing is awful.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               INT.CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               In the darkness, under covers, Charlotte is woken up by a 
               loud fire alarm.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. PARK HYATT - NIGHT

               The fire alarm booms as the hotel guests and staff hurry out 
               of the hotel.

               Amidst the crowd of Hotel guests in their pajamas, Charlotte 
               finds Bob- he's wearing a kimono and slippers. She's in boxer 
               shorts and an undershirt and slippers.

                                     BOB
                         I'm sorry.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         That lunch was the worst, huh.

               He laughs.

               She looks down at his feet stuffed into the little hotel 
               slippers.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         When are you leaving?

                                     BOB
                         Tomorrow.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (friendly)
                         I'm going to miss you.

                                     BOB
                         That's what you said the other night.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Well, I mean it more now.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PARK HYATT BAR - NIGHT

               and Charlotte, still in their pajamas, sit at their usual 
               spot at the bar, with the bartender, drinking cold sake. She 
               lights two cigarettes and passes one to him.

               A NEW JAZZ BAND is now playing. The SINGER is full of 
               enthusiasm as they start their stint at the Park Hyatt.

                                     NEW SINGER
                         Good Evening. I'm Carl West, and 
                         we're thrilled to be joining you 
                         this week, here at the NY bar in 
                         Shinjuku.

               He sings "Where or When" with all his heart.

               Now, old-timers there, Bob and Charlotte look at each other 
               and chuckle.

                                     SINGER
                         Jt seems we stood and talked like  
                         this before,   we looked at  each 
                         other in  the same way thenr   but  
                         I cant remember where or when...

               Bob and Charlotte sit there together.

                                     BOB
                         I don't want to go back tomorrow.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I know. But, it doesn't last, you 
                         have to go back sometime.

                                     BOB
                         Why can't it last?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I don't know, it just doesn't, reality 
                         changes things....we can't stay here 
                         forever, unless maybe we started a 
                         Jazz band.

               (alt Charlotte dialog: I don't know it just doesn't, reality 
               changes things...and we can't stay here forever)

               He looks over at her.

               The singer continues Where or When, as they sit there 
               together, the view sparkling.

                                     SINGER (O.C.)
                         Somethings  that happen for the first 
                         time,   seem to be happening again 
                         and so it  seems we have met before,   
                         and laughed before,   and loved 
                         before,   but who knows where or 
                         when...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

               Bob and Charlotte, drunk in the elevator.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         54?

               He nods, she pushes 54 for him and 56 for herself.

               They look at each other across the empty elevator, both 
               leaning against the walls.

               The elevator stops at 54, he leans in to kiss her good-night. 
               They kiss like you would on the cheek- but it's closer to 
               their mouths. The door shuts- he missed his floor.

               The elevator continues up, and stops on her floor. They kiss 
               good-night again and she gets out before the door closes.

               He watches the door close on her as she makes her way down 
               the long beige hall.

                                                                  FADE OUT:


               INT. CHARLOTTE'S ROOM - DAY

               A fax comes through the machine in the empty room.

               IT'S A NOTE AND CUTE DRAWING FROM JOHN -

               SEE YOU ON SATURDAY, I MISS YOU..."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PARK HYATT LOBBY LOUNGE - DAY

               A sexy EXECUTIVE WOMAN asks Bob for a light. He looks at her 
               great legs as he lights her cigarette. He looks around, 
               keeping an eye out for Charlotte. The group of commercial 
               people arrive to see him off.

               He excuses himself for a moment and goes to a phone on a 
               little table in the corner.

               Bob picks up the house phone.

                                     RECEPTION (O.S.)
                         Hello? Yes?

               Traditional Japanese music plays on hold.

                         I will connect you.

               Bob gets the room voice-mail.

                                     BOB
                         Uh...Hi, Charlotte... it's me, Bob... 
                         ok, I guess you're not there... wanted 
                         to say good-bye...

               He hangs up, feeling lame.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOTEL RECEPTION -DAY

               Bob with his bags tries to call again. The commercial people 
               and hotel staff crowd around to help him, asking about his 
               stay.

                                     BOB
                         Charlotte?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Hi, Bob.

                                     BOB
                         I'm just leaving.... do you have my 
                         jacket?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.

                                     BOB
                         That'd be great.

                                     CHARLOTT
                         E Ok, see you in a second.

               A member of the hotel staff brings him an envelope on a little 
               silver tray.

               Miss Kawasaki gives him some gifts from their company in 
               traditional Japanese wrapping, he doesn't know what to do 
               with them and has to carry them.

               The Executive Woman from the bar walks up to him. He hangs 
               up the phone.

                                     BOB
                         0hr hi.

                                     EXEC WOMAN
                         You're leaving?

               She looks at him like, we could have had some fun.

                                     BOB
                         Yeah, yeah, I'm going.

               He sees Charlotte come out of the elevator.

                                     BOB
                         I have to go, thanks, bye.

               He rushes over to Charlotte. She looks at his bag.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Just saying good-bye to everyone 
                         before you leave?

                                     BOB
                         Yes, no.

               She hands him his jacket.

                                     BOB
                         Thanks.

               She waits for him to say something more. He wants to tell 
               her he loves her, that she should come with him.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         That's it?

               The concierge tells him his car is here.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You're leaving right now?

                                     BOB
                         Yes.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Well... have a good flight.

                                     BOB
                         Thanks.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (hurt)
                         Ok, bye.

               She walks away.

               A hotel manager asks Bob about his luggage, another asks if 
               he had a pleasant stay. Charlotte gets in the elevator to go 
               out, the doors close on her back.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. PARK HYATT - DAY

               It's bright outside the main entrance. A presidential pulls 
               up and the automatic door opens. Bob squints as the Bellboy 
               in white gloves slowly loads his luggage into the trunk.

               INT. CAR - DAY

               In the backseat, Bob leans back on the little doily.

               The car pulls away.

               Around the corner, he looks down a crowded alley and sees 
               Charlotte's blonde hair.

                                     BOB
                         Can you pull over a second?

               The DRIVER, wearing white cloth gloves, pulls the car over 
               slowly. Bob tries to open the door'99 it won't open, he has 
               to wait for the automatic doors to open for him (slowly).

               EXT. TOKYO STREETS - DAY

               Bob gets out and rushes down the street to where he saw 
               Charlotte. The street is crowded with JAPANESE PEOPLE, and 
               different colored umbrellas, (it's sunny out with a light 
               rain).

               Music blasts from speakers on the street, and there is some 
               promo going on with GIRLS handing out little cologne samples. 
               Bob looks around for her, but only sees dark hair, umbrellas, 
               and super tan JAPANESE KIDS.

               In the distance an umbrella moves to reveal Charlotte.

                                     BOB
                         CHARLOTTE!

               But she can't hear him over the loudspeaker. He rushes to 
               her.

               C.U. she turns and we see she is crying.

               The music swells. He embraces her, holding her close to him 
               in the crowd.

                                     BOB
                         Why are you crying?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (sincere)
                         I'll miss you.

               He kisses her, hugs her good-bye.

                                     BOB
                         I know, I'm going to miss you, too.

               He holds her close.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Charlotte watches Bob as he reaches his car, he turns and 
               looks at her.

               She smiles at him, and is lost in the crowd.

               Bob gets into his car.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Charlotte walks with the crowd as they go on their way.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAR - DAY

               Back in the Presidential, alone, Bob leans against the little 
               doily.  They drive off.

               He looks out the window, Bob's happy he's going home, he's 
               happy he came to Tokyo.

               Bob's P.O.V.-  Tokyo goes past his window.

                                                             FADE TO BLACK:

                                         THE END
