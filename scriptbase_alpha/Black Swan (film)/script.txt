          1 INT. DARK STAGE - NIGHT 1
                         
                          OPENING CREDITS:
                         
           A SPOTLIGHT slices black space.
                         
           In its beam, a DANCER materializes. She is fair-skinned.
           Beautiful and pure.
                         
           The maiden twirls on pointe, a smile on her face, light as
           air and carefree.
                         
           She pauses, her face grows worried. Sensing someone watching.
                         
           Scared, she peers into the darkness.
                         
           She moves now, looking, growing more frantic.
                         
           Then, a SINISTER MAN emerges out of the darkness behind her.
           She stumbles backwards, frightened.
                         
           She tries to escape, twirling away, but he pursues. His true
           form is revealed, the demon ROTHBART.
                         
           He flings his open hand towards her, casting the spell.
                         
           She wants to scream, but nothing comes out. She looks at her
           body, sensing something happening to her. Something
           terrifying.
                         
           She spins, panicking, but it's too late. She disappears
           beneath the beast's cape.
                         
           She emerges as the WHITE SWAN, the iconic protagonist of SWAN
           LAKE.
                         
           CUT TO BLACK.
                         
                         
          2 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - MORNING 2
                         
           In the darkness, a pair of EYES. They belong to NINA, the
           same dancer. She lies awake in bed, thinking about her dream.
                         
           The room looks like it hasn't been redecorated since she was
           a teenager. Stuffed animals. Dolls. Pink and frilly.
                         
           The door opens, throwing LIGHT on her face. Nina looks
           towards the door and smiles softly at whoever opened it.
                         
           Nina sits up and hangs her BARE FEET off the side of the bed.
           Like all ballerinas, she's beautiful and her feet are
           atrocious. Covered in corns, broken blisters and bunions. She
           arches them, doing her first extensions of the day.
           2.
                         
          3 INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING 3
                         
           The room is empty of furniture to leave space for dancing. A
           large mirror covers the opposite wall entirely.
                         
           Nina rubs her knees to get them warm, and then begins her
           morning exercises, extending and contracting her feet and
           legs in precise and rhythmic motions.
                         
           The skin on her chest stretches tautly over her sternum.
           Defined vertebrae run up her back, sinewy muscles contract as
           she moves. Her slender neck leads into her hair, contained
           in a ballerina's bun.
                         
           Nina looks serene as she moves, completely in her element.
                         
           She hears someone fussing about in the kitchen.
                         
                          NINA
                          (WHILE STRETCHING)
           I had the most amazing dream last
           night. I was dancing the White
           Swan.
                         
           No answer.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           Different choreography, like the
           Bolshoi's. It was the prologue,
           when Rothbart casts his spell.
                         
           Still no answer.
                         
           Nina continues to stretch.
                         
                         
          4 INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 4
                         
           Nina sits at the table. An older woman, ERICA, places a
           POACHED EGG and a QUARTER-GRAPEFRUIT in front of her.
                         
                          ERICA
           You're in a good mood.
                         
                          NINA
           I'm just excited to get back.
                         
                          ERICA
           Off-season always makes you grumpy.
                         
                          NINA
                          (RE: GRAPEFRUIT)
           Look how pink. So pretty.
           2A.
                         
                          ERICA NINA
           (inside joke) (inside joke)
          Pretty. Pretty.
                         
          They giggle and Erica resumes packing Nina's shoulder bag
          with extra clothing, shoes, snack filled tupperware, duct
          tape, ribbon, thread, etc.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           Plus he promised to feature me
           more.
                         
                          ERICA
           He certainly should. You're the
           most dedicated dancer in the
           company.
                         
          Nina smiles, comforted, and begins taking her vitamins.
                         
          Erica walks over with a SWEATSHIRT and holds it above her.
          Nina pulls it over her head and starts to push her arms
          through the sleeves.
           3.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
                          (NOTICING SOMETHING)
           What's that?
                         
                          NINA
           What?
                         
                          ERICA
           There.
                         
           Erica points to her shoulder. Nina feels and finds a small
           SCRATCH MARK.
                         
           She shrugs and shakes her head.
                         
           Erica gives her a suspicious look, but lets it go and smiles.
           Nina finishes pulling down the sweatshirt.
                         
           Erica hugs Nina into her chest and kisses the top of her
           head.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           Sweet girl.
                         
           Erica releases her and Nina begins eating.
                         
                         
          5 INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - DAY 5
                         
           Nina rides inside a crowded subway, staring absentmindedly at
           her faint reflection in the train's window.
                         
           Suddenly, another train roars by on the opposite track,
           snapping her awake.
                         
           In the next train car, she sees the back of a BALLERINA
           standing in the midst of the crowd. Her head bops to music
           playing through iPod earphones.
                         
           Nina moves a strand of hair out of her eyes, and at that
           exact moment, the girl in the next car moves in the same way.
           Mirroring her.
                         
           Unnerved, Nina slowly lowers her arm. So does the other girl.
           Although Nina can't quite see her face, the girl seems
           IDENTICAL from Nina's vantage point.
           4.
                         
           The train jerks to a stop as it arrives at a station. Nina
           sees the girl head to the exit. She cranes to see her face,
           but her view's obscured.
                         
           The doors slide shut and the train pulls out. Nina watches
           the platform whisk by, keeping her eyes peeled, but she
           doesn't see the girl.
                         
                         
                         6 OMITTED 6
                         
                         
          7 EXT. LINCOLN CENTER - DAY 7
                         
           Nina emerges from the subway station onto a city street.
                         
           She arrives at the MAJESTIC-LOOKING THEATER, where a few
           other BALLERINAS likewise trickle towards the entrance. They
           all look strangely similar: slender, carrying shoulder bags,
           wearing leggings and loose sweatshirts.
                         
           She passes a ROW OF POSTERS featuring the company's prima
           ballerina, BETH MACINTYRE.
                         
           Nina looks at them, a little envious, before continuing on to
           the STAGE DOOR.
                         
                         
          8 INT. SOLOIST DRESSING ROOM - DAY 8
                         
           Crammed into a single dressing room, Nina and the company's 5
           SOLOISTS get ready for rehearsal. Chatting, sewing ribbon
           onto shoes, applying makeup, putting band-aids on blisters.
                         
           Nina removes a new pair of BALLET SHOES, admires them for a
           moment, before cutting off the satin toe with scissors.
                         
           In the background, catty VERONICA and Russian GALINA gossip.
                         
                          VERONICA
           Can't believe she's back.
                         
                          GALINA
           Of course she is.
                         
                          VERONICA
           She can't take a hint? Company's
           broke. No one comes to see her
           anymore.
                         
                          SOLOIST 1
           No one comes to see ballet period.
           5.
                         
                          VERONICA
           That's not true, I heard the Royal
           had one of their best seasons yet.
                         
                          GALINA
           He needs to try something new.
                         
                          VERONICA
           No, someone new.
                         
                          SOLOIST 1
           Like who?
                         
                          VERONICA
           Like someone who's not approaching
           menopause.
                         
          They snicker.
                         
                          NINA
           I think it's sad.
                         
                          VERONICA
           What's sad?
                         
                          NINA
           Beth's such an amazing dancer.
                         
                          GALINA
           So's my grand-mother.
                         
                          NINA
           Fonteyn danced into her 50's...
                         
                          VERONICA
                          (ROLLING EYES)
           Yeah, we know.
                         
          Irked, Nina starts POUNDING the shoes against the floor to
          soften the toe.
                         
          Her eyes are drawn to a NEW GIRL standing in the doorway.
          Nina pauses to scrutinize her. She wears vampy make-up, hair
          down. Dark and sexy.
                         
                          NEW GIRL
           Soloists?
                         
          Wary, the girls mumble mmm-hmm's and nod.
                         
           NEW GIRL (CONT'D)
           Great.
           6.
                         
           She slinks past the suspicious group of girls and plops down
           at an open spot.
                         
           NEW GIRL (CONT'D)
           Fucking got off the wrong stop and
           had to hoof it from 79th.
                         
           Nina exchanges glances with the other girls, taken aback.
                         
           The new girl notices the looks, smirks to herself and starts
           getting ready.
                         
                         
          9 INT. LARGE REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY 9
                         
           Nina wears a look of intense concentration as the entire
           company warms up, including the pubescent CORPS MEMBERS and a
           handful of MALE DANCERS.
                         
           LEGS, HANDS, and FEET repeat the same movements all around
           her, led by a severe BALLET MISTRESS.
                         
                          BALLET MISTRESS
           To the back, fondu, to the back,
           plie. Fourth, fourth, and one and
           fifth, to the back...
           (to a corps member)
           Like this. Push it. Why can't you
           do this?
                         
           Using the mirror, Nina monitors her movements carefully. The
           mistress surprises her.
                         
           BALLET MISTRESS (CONT'D)
           It needs to be looser. Relax. Let
           it flow.
                         
           Flustered, Nina nods and tries to follow her instruction.
                         
           Suddenly, the girls around Nina begin stripping off their
           sweatshirts and insulated pants.
                         
           Nina sees that the intense and brooding director of the
           company, THOMAS LEROY, has entered the space. He has the
           unkept look of an artist. Magnetic and intense.
                         
           The ballerinas remove their warm-up gear to show off their
           bodies.
                         
           Leroy walks around the room, judging his flock. Smiles and
           glances are thrown his way.
                         
           He goes up to the ballet mistress, takes her hand and kisses
           her on the cheek. Even she manages a smile.
           7.
                         
          He heads to the line of soloists, studying them.
                         
                          LEROY
           We all know the story: virginal
           girl, pure and sweet, trapped in
           the body of a swan. She desires
           freedom, but only true love can
           break the spell.
                         
          He taps a dancer on the shoulder, she lights up. He walks,
          then taps another. A selection process of some kind.
                         
          Nina looks nervous, has an inkling of what it means.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Her wish is granted in the form of
           a prince.
                         
          He nears Nina. She sneaks peeks at him, eager and hopeful.
          He acknowledges her with a small nod and a smile.
                         
          But he walks on without tapping her. She deflates.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           But before he can declare his love,
           her lustful twin, the Black Swan,
           tricks and seduces him.
                         
          He approaches the New Girl. Nina watches, threatened.
                         
          But he doesn't tap her either.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Devastated, the White Swan leaps
           off a cliff, killing herself. But,
           in death, finds freedom.
                         
          He taps one more soloist and then CLAPS.
                         
          The music stops and all the girls face him, attentive.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Good morning, company.
                         
          They respond "Good morning" in nervous, unsure voices.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           We open our season with Swan Lake.
           Done to death, I know. But not like
           this. We strip it down. Make it
           visceral and real.
                         
          He pauses for effect.
           8.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           And a new production needs a new
           Swan Queen. A fresh face to present
           to the world.
                         
           Surprised, the soloists glance at each other, trying to keep
           their cool.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           But which of you can embody both
           swans? The white and the black?
                         
           Nina prepares for disappointment.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           All the soloists I touched...
           Please go to your scheduled
           rehearsals this afternoon.
                         
           The girls are confused.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           And the girls I didn't touch, meet
           me in studio B at five.
                         
           Nina breathes, realizing the girls he didn't tap are the ones
           he's selected, purposefully toying with them.
                         
                         
          10 INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - DAY 10
                         
           Hidden inside a nook, Nina has her eyes closed, nervously
           HUMMING the score to Swan Lake.
                         
           She makes small motions with her feet and hands, going
           through the choreography in her mind. Preparing for the
           audition.
                         
           A loud CRASHING sound snaps her out of it.
                         
           She goes out into the hallway to investigate.
                         
           The door to a PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM is halfway open. Nina
           cautiously approaches.
                         
           Inside, she can see someone moving around the room in a fury,
           trashing it.
                         
           Suddenly, the door swings open and BETH MACINTYRE bursts out.
                         
           She makes brief eye-contact with Nina.
                         
                          BETH
           What?!
           9.
                         
           Nina just shakes her head.
                         
           Beth scoffs as she slams the door behind her. She clips down
           the hall in the opposite direction.
                         
           Nina waits until she's gone, then moves closer to the door
           and peeks inside, curious.
                         
           She checks to make sure no one's around and quickly enters.
                         
                         
          11 INT. PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM - SAME 11
                         
           Large and comfortable. Beth's presence is everywhere.
           Photographs, clothing, and personal belongings scattered
           across the space.
                         
           Nina looks at herself in the mirror and smiles, imagining how
           great it would be...
                         
           Then she notices a LARGE VASE lying on the floor. The flowers
           have been shredded, water everywhere.
                         
           She moves to the vanity counter and touches Beth's
           belongings in reverence. The items are neatly laid out:
           ballet supplies, jewelry, and makeup.
                         
           Her fingers brush a tube of LIPSTICK. She picks it up.
                         
           Nina slips the lipstick into her bag and exits the room.
                         
                         
          12 INT. PRINCIPAL REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY 12
                         
           In the middle of her audition, Nina dances Odette's Variation
           from Act II of the ballet, a frightened look on her face.
                         
           Although her movement is incredibly precise, there's a
           definite vulnerability. Exactly as the White Swan should be:
           fear tinged with melancholy.
                         
           Leroy waves his arm. The music and Nina stop abruptly.
                         
           He approaches her and, when he gets close, taps on her
           sternum with two of his fingers.
                         
                          LEROY
           So Nina, would you like to be the
           Swan Queen?
                         
                          NINA
           If you want me to be.
                         
           He leans in and talks softly so the other girls can't hear.
           10.
                         
                          LEROY
           Well, if I was just casting the
           White Swan, she'd be yours.
                         
          She can't help but smile, flattered. He pulls away from her.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           But I'm not.
                         
          He turns to the PIANO PLAYER.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Maestro, Odile's Coda.
                         
          The piano player rifles through the song book.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Show me your Black Swan, Nina.
                         
          Nervous, she glances over at Veronica and Galina, who
          anxiously await their turn.
                         
          She takes a few breaths, then looks towards the piano player
          and nods.
                         
          The music begins.
                         
          Nina dances a few steps, and then launches into the most
          difficult and famous part of Swan Lake: The Black Swan's
          Coda. It consists of 32 consecutive fouettes (spins).
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Come on, not so controlled.
                         
          The music builds in intensity, she pushes herself into the
          next turn.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Seduce us! Not just the Prince, but
           the court, the audience, the entire
           world! The fouettes are like a
           spider spinning her web. Come on!
           Attack it! Attack it!
                         
          Leroy runs his hand through his hair, dismayed.
                         
          A look of worry spreads across Nina's face. Knows she's
          blowing it.
                         
          The door CLANGS open and throws Nina's focus completely. She
          stumbles, several spins short of finishing.
           11.
                         
           The New Girl obliviously marches into the room, listening to
           an iPod.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
                          (SARCASTIC)
           Good of you to join us.
                         
           The New Girl notices everyone staring and pulls out her
           earphones to talk.
                         
                          NEW GIRL
           Sorry.
                         
                          LEROY
           Girls, this is Lily. Straight off
           the plane from San Francisco. She's
           filling Rebecca's old spot.
                         
           LILY gives a small wave. Nina eyes her with scorn as she
           catches her breath.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Go on, get warmed up.
                         
                          LILY
           I'm good.
                         
           Lily starts stripping off her layers, revealing her lithe
           body. On her back, she has a TATTOO OF LILIES.
                         
                          NINA
           Should I go again?
                         
                          LEROY
           (distracted by Lily)
           I've seen enough. Thank you, Nina.
                         
           She looks down, getting his meaning.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Okay, Veronica. Your turn. The
           White Swan's variation...
                         
           Furious, Nina marches out of the room.
                         
                         
          A13 INT. THEATER BATHROOM STALL - NIGHT A13
                         
           Nina stands up from a kneeled position and flushes the
           toilet. She wipes her mouth with the back of her hand and
           exits the stall.

          15 EXT. STREET - NIGHT 15
                         
           Nina walks along a quiet side street. She clutches her
           jacket, for warmth and comfort.
                         
           Her CELL PHONE starts ringing. She digs it out of her bag and
           checks the CALLER ID: MOM. She silences it and puts it away.
                         
           Up ahead, she sees the sidewalk dead end at a construction
           site, and detour into an enclosed PASSAGEWAY beneath the
           scaffolding.
                         
           Nina slows, a little scared, but decides to push on.
                         
           The passageway is dark. The temporary lighting dim and
           flickering.
                         
           She walks quickly, trying to get to the other side.
                         
           She hears the sound of soft FOOTSTEPS approaching. She
           stops, and the other FOOTSTEPS stop.
                         
           She looks up and sees the faint outline of a SLENDER WOMAN
           standing there, almost ghostlike.
                         
           Nina starts walking again, keeping her head down, and the
           other woman continues as well.
           13.
                         
           As they pass each other, Nina glances at the woman's face and
           discovers...
                         
           The woman looks EXACTLY LIKE HER.
                         
           But the moment passes as the woman continues walking.
                         
           Nina stares after her, perturbed.
                         
           Her cell phone starts RINGING again, piercing the silence.
           Nina continues out, ignoring the phone.
                         
                         
          16 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - NIGHT 16
                         
           Nina enters and locks the deadbolt and chain-lock behind her.
                         
           She turns and is startled to see Erica standing right there.
                         
                          ERICA
           How did it go?
                         
           Nina looks at her confused. Erica helps take off her coat.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           You were late, so I called Susie in
           the office. An audition?! Can't
           believe he just sprung that on you.
                         
           Nina nods.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           So?
                         
                          NINA
           It went okay.
                         
                          ERICA
           Just okay?
                         
           Erica hangs up her coat, turns and sees Nina tearing up.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           Darling?
                         
           The tears start falling now.
                         
           Erica goes to her and wraps her in an embrace.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           Shhh, shhh, tell me what happened.
           14.
                         
          17 INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 17
                         
           Nina lies on the floor, stewing. Her legs straight in the air
           to drain the lactic acid in her muscles.
                         
           ERICA (O.S.)
                          (FROM KITCHEN)
           I told them it doesn't matter how
           talented their daughter is, if she
           misses any more classes, she's out.
           She forgets half of what I teach
           her, and I waste time catching her
           up. It's ridiculous.
                         
           Nina sits up and retrieves a pair of point shoes from her
           bag. She considers them for a moment, then starts to put them
           on.
                         
           She stands, takes a breath, and does a single spin, testing
           the waters.
                         
           She takes a breath and spins again, then again, then again.
           Each spin is punctuated by a jab of her foot into the floor.
                         
           THWACK, THWACK. THWACK.
                         
           She jabs her toe down, hard...
                         
                          NINA
           Ow!
                         
           She winces in pain and automatically grabs her foot.
                         
           ERICA (O.S.)
           Everything alright?
                         
                          NINA
           I'm fine!
                         
           Nina leans her back against the mirror and removes her shoe.
           Her right big toenail has split, oozing blood.
                         
           Nina breathes through the pain and puts her shoe back on.
                         
           She reassumes the position, takes a couple breaths, and
           starts spinning again.
                         
           Her toe jabs into the floor. She winces a little with pain,
           but keeps pushing.
                         
           Her face grows more determined, focused. 20, 21, 22 spins....
                         
           She starts to look powerful, willing herself to succeed.
           14A.
                         
          At the end of the 32nd spin, Nina jabs her foot down hard.
                         
          She's done it!
                         
          Nina looks at herself in the mirror, glazed in sweat, a
          slight smile of satisfaction.
           15.
                         
          18 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 18
                         
           Nina sits on the edge of the bed, as Erica douses some GAUZE
           with PEROXIDE and dabs it on the split toenail. Nina reacts
           to the sting.
                         
                          ERICA
           Shhh. Almost done...You're working
           yourself too hard. We all have off
           days.
                         
                          NINA
           If that girl hadn't barged in.
                         
                          ERICA
           I'm sure she didn't mean to.
           Remember when you started? If I
           hadn't taken you to each of your
           classes, you would have been
           completely lost.
                         
                          NINA
           I'm gonna talk to him. Tell him I
           finished it.
                         
                          ERICA
           He knows you can do the coda. It
           won't convince him one way or the
           other.
                         
           Annoyed, Nina lies down, looking away from her mother. 
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D) 
           Oh, sweetheart, I know it's 
           disappointing. When you start to 
           get older, there's all this 
           ridiculous pressure. God knows, I 
           understand. 
                         
           Erica squeezes some arnica gel into her palm and massages it
           into Nina's calves.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           But it's alright. No matter what. 
           You'll probably get to dance the
           Pas de Quatre again. That's such a
           wonderful part. Or maybe he'll make
           you a Big Swan. Either way, you'll
           shine.
                         
                          NINA
           I know, mom.
           15A.
                         
          Erica removes Nina's EARRINGS, then opens a JEWELRY BOX
          sitting on the night stand and drops them inside. A TOY
          BALLERINA spins to TINNY MUSIC.
                         
          Nina gets under the covers. Erica tucks her in and sits down
          on the edge of the bed.
           16.
                         
                          ERICA
           Everything will be better in the
           morning. It always is.
                         
           She strokes Nina's hair, humming along to the music.
                         
           Nina watches the ballerina spin and spin with a determined
           stare.
                         
                         
                         19 OMITTED 19
                         
                         
                         20 OMITTED 20
                         
                         
          21 INT. SUBWAY - DAY 21
                         
           Nina applies the lipstick she stole from Beth, using the side
           window as a mirror. The jerky motion of the train makes it
           difficult, but she manages.
                         
                         
          22 INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - DAY 22
                         
           Nina waits anxiously outside Leroy's office.
                         
           She hears someone approach, looks up and sees Leroy coming
           down the hall.
                         
           She puts on a nervous smile. He doesn't reciprocate.
                         
                          LEROY
           Yes, Nina?
                         
                          NINA
           Do you have a minute?
                         
           He doesn't answer, just opens the door to the office and
           walks in.
                         
           She takes a breath and then follows.
                         
                         
          23 INT. LEROY'S OFFICE - SAME 23
                         
           Nina closes the door and faces the cozy, dark space. Large
           couch, posters from the ballet on the wall--several featuring
           Beth.
                         
           Leroy lights a cigarette, quietly studying her and not making
           this easy. He takes a drag, and exhales.
           17.
                         
                          NINA
           If now's not a good time...
                         
                          LEROY
           Now's fine, what is it?
                         
                          NINA
           I just wanted to tell you, I
           practiced the coda last night, and
           I did it.
                         
                          LEROY
           How thrilling for you.
                         
                          NINA
                          (THROWN)
           Well...
                         
                          LEROY
           Okay, Nina, listen, I honestly
           don't care about your technique,
           you should know that by now.
                         
                          NINA
           Yes, but-
                         
                          LEROY
           Anyway, I've already chosen
           Veronica, so...
                         
          He lifts his hands in the air, "there you go."
                         
                          NINA
                          (DEVASTATED)
           I see.
                         
          She makes a move towards the door.
                         
                          LEROY
           You're not going to try and change
           my mind?
                         
          She looks back at him, uncertain.
                         
          Leroy nonchalantly stubs out his cigarette.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           You must have thought it was
           possible, coming to find me like
           this.
                         
          He pauses, looks her up and down as if trying to decipher
          her.
           18.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Why are you here? All dolled up?
                         
                          NINA
                          (UNSURE)
           I came to ask you to give me the
           part.
                         
                          LEROY
           That all?
                         
          She doesn't know what he means. He comes around his desk and
          approaches her.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Truth is, when I look at you, all I
           see is the White Swan. Yes, you're
           beautiful, fragile, fearful. Ideal
           casting. But the Black Swan...it's
           a hard fucking job to dance both.
                         
                          NINA
           I can be the Black Swan too.
                         
                          LEROY
           Really? She's hungry, volatile. In
           four years, every time you dance, I
           see you obsess over getting each
           move exactly right, but I never see
           you lose yourself.
                         
          Insecure, she looks like she wants to run out of the room.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           All that discipline, for what?
                         
                          NINA
           I want to be perfect.
                         
          He laughs.
                         
                          LEROY
           Perfection's not just about
           control. It's also about letting
           go. Surprising the audience.
           Surprising yourself. Transcendence.
                         
          He considers her for a moment.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Very few have it in them.
                         
                          NINA
                          I-
           18A.
                         
          Without warning, he slowly plants a kiss on her mouth.
                         
          It lasts for a moment, but he suddenly jerks away.
                         
                          LEROY
           Ow! Fuck!
                         
          He touches his lip, stunned.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           You bit me.
           19.
                         
           She's too scared to respond.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
                          (AMUSED)
           I can't believe it. That fucking
           hurt.
                         
           He goes to the mirror to check for damage. He glances back at
           Nina.
                         
                          NINA
                          (MUMBLED)
           Sorry.
                         
           She quickly leaves, shell-shocked.
                         
                         
          24 INT. LARGE REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY 24
                         
           The company stretch and go through their usual warm-up
           routine, a tension in the air. The casting decision still
           uncertain.
                         
           Nina touches her lips, thinking about the encounter. Then
           looks over at Veronica, knowing the good news in store.
           Veronica notices. Nina looks away.
                         
                          VERONICA
                          (IRKED)
           What?
                         
           Nina shakes her head.
                         
           A sudden energy sweeps the room, and she hears the sound of
           scuffling feet and whispering. "It's up." "She just posted
           it." "C'mon."
                         
           The dancers start exiting into the hallway. Veronica turns to
           follow.
                         
                          NINA
           Veronica?
                         
           Veronica turns around. It's hard, but Nina decides to be a
           good loser.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           Congratulations.
                         
           Nina subtly glances at the exiting girls and Veronica
           immediately gets it.
                         
           She excitedly pushes through the crowd of girls, wanting to
           see for herself.
           20.
                         
           Knowing the outcome already, Nina continues stretching in the
           deserted space, resigned to her fate. She finishes, grabs
           her belongings and walks out.
                         
                         
          25 INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - SAME 25
                         
           A crowd of dancers surround the bulletin board, jostling to
           get a look.
                         
           Nina starts walking down the hall in the opposite direction.
                         
           Behind her, she can hear a small commotion and then:
                         
           VERONICA (O.S.)
           Why did you tell me that?
                         
           She turns and sees Veronica, her face flushed with anger.
                         
                          VERONICA (CONT'D)
           Your idea of a joke?
                         
                          NINA
                          (CONFUSED)
           What?
                         
                          VERONICA
           Fuck you.
                         
           Veronica storms away.
                         
           The group of girls stares at Nina, making her very self-
           conscious.
                         
           Nina tentatively approaches the bulletin board, to see what
           Veronica's outburst was all about.
                         
           First a few, then more and more of the girls smile at her.
           They make room for her as she pushes through.
                         
           She finally gets to the CASTING NOTICE, finds "Swan Queen"
                          AND UNDERNEATH:
                         
                          NINA SAYERS
                         
           Stunned, she turns around to face the mass of ballerinas.
                         
           She sees Lily eyeing her with a flat expression, which turns
           into a smile to mask her disappointment.
                         
           The other girls start congratulating and hugging Nina, some
           more sincerely than others.
           21.
                         
          26 INT. THEATER BATHROOM - DAY 26
                         
           Nina bursts in through the door and heads directly for one of
           the stalls.
                         
           She locks herself in for privacy and dials a number on her
           CELL PHONE. She holds it to her ear, anxiously waiting for
           the person to answer.
                         
                          NINA
           Hey...Everything's fine...He picked
           me, mommy.
                         
           She waits for a response.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           Did you hear me?...Yes, I'm going
           to be the Swan Queen.
                         
           Nina laughs at her mother's response and can't help but start
           crying.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           I'll be home soon, okay? I just had
           to tell you.
                         
           Nina hangs up and the tears really start flowing. She's
           dreamt of this for so long, it's almost too much to bear.
                         
           She wipes the tears off with the back of her hand and pulls
           herself together. She comes out of the stall...
                         
           Horrified to discover "WHORE" written on the mirror in RED
           LIPSTICK.
                         
           Nina looks around the bathroom, to make sure she's alone.
                         
           She snags a paper towel and wipes off the insult, smearing
           the mirror with red streaks.
                         
                         
          27 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - AFTERNOON 27
                         
           Nina unlocks the door to the apartment.
                         
                          NINA
           Mom?
                         
           Nina looks around, puzzled she isn't there.
                         
                         
          28 INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - LATER 28
                         
           Nina opens the door and pokes her head in.
           22.
                         
           But Erica's not in there either. Nina glances at the walls.
                         
           Where several homemade PAINTINGS hang, all of the same
           subject: Nina as a young girl, posing in a tutu. On a desk,
           the ORIGINAL PHOTOGRAPH is clipped to a painting in progress.
                         
           Out of the corner of her eye, one of the portraits seems to
           shift. Nina turns towards it, but the painting's now
           perfectly still.
                         
           Unsettled, Nina withdraws.
                         
                         
          29 INT. APARTMENT BATHROOM - NIGHT 29
                         
           Post-shower, Nina's fuzzy reflection stares back in a steam
           covered mirror.
                         
           Nina takes her hand and wipes a streak across, to see herself
           more clearly.
                         
           She looks nervous. The enormity of what's in front of her
           setting in.
                         
           She turns side-to-side, scrutinizing her body. She lifts her
           arm and pinches the skin to check her weight.
                         
           She notices a small cluster of RED BUMPS on her shoulder. A
           small RASH.
                         
           She feels the bumps with her fingers, bothered.
                         
           She checks the same place on her other shoulder.
                         
           There's no rash, just faint streaks of SCAR TISSUE.
                         
           Nina slides the hamper in front of the door to block it.
                         
           In the mirror now, one of the bumps is scratched and
           bleeding.
                         
           Nina quickly wipes the blood off with her finger.
                         
           The sound of the front door opening steals her attention.
                         
                         
          30 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - NIGHT 30
                         
           Nina exits the bathroom wearing a robe.
                         
           In the kitchen, she sees a CAKE with a lit SPARKLER sitting
           on the table. Her mother smiles anxiously.
           23.
                         
                          ERICA
           My daughter, the Swan Queen.
                         
           She opens her arms and Nina falls into a hug.
                         
           She looks at the cake. It has a ballerina sketched with
           frosting. Nina hides her disdain.
                         
                          NINA
           Oh, mom.
                         
                          ERICA
           It's our favorite, vanilla with
           strawberry filling.
                         
           Erica picks up a knife and slices into the cake.
                         
                          NINA
           Just a little piece.
                         
           Erica ignores her and starts cutting a very large piece.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           That's way too much.
                         
                          ERICA
           It's a celebration.
                         
                          NINA
           My stomach's still in knots.
                         
                          ERICA
                          (OFFENDED)
           Fine then.
                         
           Erica grabs the whole cake and heads towards the trash.
                         
                          NINA
                          (GUILTY)
           Mom, don't. I'm sorry.
                         
           Erica hesitates, but returns. She sets the cake back down.
                         
                          ERICA
           I'm just so proud of you.
                         
           Erica lifts the slice onto a plate.
                         
                          NINA
           It looks yummy.
                         
                         
                         31 OMITTED 31
           24.
                         
          32 INT. PRINCIPAL REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY 32
                         
           First day in the new role, Nina stretches alone.
                         
           Muffled sounds of other ballerinas chatting and giggling
           drift in from the large rehearsal space. Makes Nina feel a
           little isolated.
                         
           DAVID (O.S.)
           Hey there...
                         
           Nina turns and sees DAVID, the high-cheeked, cocky dancer
           playing Prince Siegfried.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           It is so full, where do I stand.
                         
           It is his version of a joke. Nina politely laughs.
                         
                          NINA
           Yeah...good luck finding a spot.
                         
                          DAVID
           I am David.
                         
                          NINA
           I know you are. I'm Nina.
                         
                          DAVID
           Yes. Here we go, huh?
                         
           She nods, nervous.
                         
                         
          33 INT. PRINCIPAL REHEARSAL SPACE - LATER 33
                         
           David dances around the space, miming a hunt with a cross-
           bow.
                         
           Nina enters, stretches her body to illustrate her
           transformation into human, then sees David and acts spooked.
           25.
                         
           She dances away from him, a scared look on her face,
           undulating her arms to resemble a bird's flapping.
                         
           David gives chase, but Nina spins out of his grasp,
           disentangles from him.
                         
           But he eventually snags her, and they come very close
           together.
                         
                          LEROY
           Okay!
                         
           The music stops. Nina breaks out of character and looks at
           Leroy, anxious for his reaction.
                         
           The Russian ballet mistress nods and smiles, clearly pleased.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Okay, Nina. Very good.
                         
           Nina smiles, relieved. Leroy hops out of his chair and
           approaches.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           But I knew the White Swan wouldn't
           be a problem. The real work will be
           your metamorphosis into the Black
           Swan.

           Okay.
                         
                          LEROY
           I saw a flash of her yesterday. Get
           ready to show me more of that bite.
                         
           He gives her an impish smirk. She looks down, embarrassed.
                         
                         
          34 INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - DAY 34
                         
           Nina takes a drink from the water fountain. She hears music
           emanating from the large rehearsal studio.
                         
           Curious, she walks to the open doorway and stops to watch.
                         
           CORPS MEMBERS and a few soloists form two lines on both sides
           of the room. In the middle, Veronica dances along with Lily.
                         
           Nina pays close attention to Lily, sizing her up. Her dancing
           is explosive, exudes sex.
                         
           LEROY (O.S.)
           Watch the way she moves...
           26.
                         
           Leroy has snuck up behind Nina at the doorway and gets very
           close to her.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Imprecise, but sensual. She's not
           faking it. Pay attention.
                         
           Lily makes a small mistake, but cracks up laughing, amused
           rather than bothered by her blunder.
                         
           Nina stares at her, attracted and threatened.
                         
                         
          A35 INT. PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM - DAY A35
                         
           The company's administrator, SUSIE, shows Nina into the room.
                         
                          SUSIE
           You share with Beth from now on, so
           be considerate.
                         
                          NINA
           Thanks, Susie.
                         
           Awed, Nina looks around the room. She scans Beth's
           photographs and personal belongings, and lands on a large
           bouquet of FRESH FLOWERS.
                         
                          SUSIE
           Those are for you. From Mr. Leroy.
                         
                          NINA
           Beautiful.
                         
           Susie leaves.
                         
           Nina pulls a card out from the flowers and reads. A faint
           smile curls her lips.
                         
           She opens her shoulder bag and removes a SMALL SATCHEL. She
           pulls out a pair of DIAMOND STUD EARRINGS and puts them on.
                         
                         
          35 INT. PATRON OF THE ARTS APARTMENT - NIGHT 35
                         
           Leroy pulls Nina through a fundraiser gala, filled with rich
           looking PATRONS and some DANCERS from the company.
                         
           Bewildered, Nina takes in her high-society surroundings,
           getting the occasional curious glance as she passes.
                         
           Leroy grabs a couple CHAMPAGNE glasses off a WAITER'S tray.
           He hands a glass to Nina with a smile.
           27.
                         
          He leads her up a staircase to a landing that overlooks the
          party.
                         
                          LEROY
           Ready to be thrown to the wolves?
           We need their cash, so smile. 
                         
          She smiles, as instructed.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.
                         
          The crowd turns their gaze towards them. All eyes on her.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           As I stand here tonight, I see so
           many familiar faces. Your 
           contribution to the art we all
           cherish profoundly goes straight to
           my heart and I am very grateful.
                         
          Polite applause.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Let me begin with a very important
           announcement. You all have had the
           chance to be enchanted,
           transported, sometimes devastated
           by the performances of this true
           artist of our company. She has been
           an exceptional inspiration to my
           work, a role model to our dancers
           and a deeply satisfying presence on
           our stage. You all know who I am
           talking about...Beth Macintyre
                         
          More applause. Nervous, Nina unconsciously picks at her
          cuticles.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           As we all know, every great career
           comes to an end. Beth is retiring
           at the end of the season. She will
           be giving her farewell performance
           as Melpomene, the role she
           originated in my first ballet.
                         
          People start whispering, stunned by the news. Nina sees Beth
          in the crowd, giving a sad smile to the surrounding guests.
          Trying to remain dignified.
           28.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           She will be greatly missed, but she
           will always be remembered. My
           little princess.
                         
           Amidst the mummering, Nina sees Beth quietly sneak out of the
           crowd and out the front door. Leroy quickly covers.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           But as we bid adieu to one star, we
           welcome another!
                         
           He looks at Nina. She stops picking her nails, self-
           conscious.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           As you know, we open our season
           with my new version of Swan Lake.
           Taking the role of our new Swan
           Queen is the exquisite Ms. Nina
           Sayers.
                         
           Restrained APPLAUSE.
                         
           Nina steps forward and curtseys. Someone seems to GIGGLE at
           her. Insecure, Nina glances towards the source and sees Lily
           flirting with a RICH GENT, uninterested in the official
           proceedings.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Soon you will have the pleasure of
           seeing her perform, tonight we
           raise a glass. To all of you, to
           Nina, to Beth, to beauty!
                         
           He downs his drink and the crowd follows suit.
                         
                         
          36 INT. LIVING ROOM, PATRON OF THE ARTS APARTMENT - LATER 36
                         
           PARTY GUESTS surround Nina and Leroy, trying to meet the
           company's newest star. Nina basks in all the attention.
                         
                          LEROY
           Dr. Brinson and his lovely wife,
           Ellen, tonight's sponsors.
                         
           She shakes DR. BRINSON'S hand and curtseys to MRS. BRINSON.
                         
                          NINA
           Such a beautiful event.
           29.
                         
           MRS. BRINSON
           Not as beautiful as you, dear.
                         
           Nina demurs. They're replaced by another HUSBAND and WIFE.
                         
                          LEROY
           And this is Mr. and Mrs. Stein.
                         
           Nina repeats the pleasantries, this time noticing that one of
           her cuticles is bleeding. She awkwardly pulls her hand away.
                         
           Leroy leans in and whispers in her ear.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Relax, you're doing great.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          37 INT. BATHROOM - LATER 37
                         
           Nina washes her hands. She looks at herself in the mirror and
           takes a deep breath.
                         
           Someone KNOCKS on the door.
                         
                          NINA
           Just a second.
                         
           She turns off the water and wipes her damp hands on the back
           of her neck, trying to cool herself.
                         
           She checks her finger. No blood, but there's a HANGNAIL.
                         
           Nina takes hold of the small flap and tries to yank it off.
                         
           Accidentally tearing a strip of skin from the nail to her
           second knuckle.
                         
           More KNOCKING startles her.
                         
           LILY (O.S.)
           Come on! I'm about to burst!
                         
           Nina quickly balls up the peeled skin and throws it away.
                         
           She opens the door.
           30.
                         
          Lily pushes in.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Hey! Look who it is.
                         
          Lily closes the door behind her and locks it.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           I'm Lily, by the way. Don't think
           we've officially met.
                         
                          NINA
                          (RATTLED)
           Nina.
                         
                          LILY
           Our New Swan Queen! That is so
           huge! You must be freaking out.
                         
                          NINA
           Yeah...
                         
          Lily slides her PANTIES out from under her dress and puts
          them in her clutch.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           I should probably get back.
                         
                          LILY
           Stay. Keep me company.
                         
          Lily starts to refresh her makeup.
                         
          Nina stays put for a second, uncertain.
                         
                          NINA
           Excuse me.
           31.
                         
           She opens the door and steps out, where she's immediately met
           by Leroy.
                         
           LEROY (O.S.)
           Ah, there you are.
                         
           Lily closes the door behind her.
                         
                         
          38 EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 38
                         
           Leroy escorts Nina out. It's a couple hours later and she's
           tipsy. She stumbles a little and grabs onto Leroy.
                         
                          NINA
           I think I drank too much. All those
           toasts...
                         
                          LEROY
           You did well.
                         
                          NINA
           Really?
                         
                          LEROY
           They tried to eat you alive, but
           here you are, in one piece.
                         
                          NINA
                          (MELTING)
           I guess.
                         
                          LEROY
           I'll get you a cab. Where you
           going?
                         
                          NINA
           Oh, Upper West Side.
                         
                          LEROY
           Why don't you come to my place
           first? It's on the way.
                         
           She gives him a coy glance, reading between the lines and
           hiding her excitement.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           For a drink. Unless you've had
           enough.
                         
                          NINA
           No, that's good.
                         
           He starts to look for a cab.
           32.
                         
           MRS. BRINSON (O.S.)
           Thomas!!!
                         
          They turn, see Mrs. Brinson, the host of the party, standing
          at the door.
                         
           MRS. BRINSON (CONT'D)
           You need to say hello to Karen
           Halloway before you disappear.
           She's from Texas. Correction: she
           is Texas.
                         
                          LEROY
                          (TO NINA)
           A minute more of ass-kissing. Wait
           here.
                         
          He runs back inside to say his goodbyes.
                         
          Nina smiles after him, giddy and anxious.
                         
          She notices a slender figure watching her from the shadows of
          the adjoining doorway. In the dark, she looks like Nina.
                         
                          NINA
                          (CONCERNED)
           Hello?
                         
          Spotted, the figure backs up, seeming to disappear.
                         
          Nina cautiously approaches, but can't see anyone.
                         
          She gets closer to the doorway...and someone JUMPS OUT,
          startling her.
                         
          It's Beth, drunk and shivering. Cheeks streaked with mascara.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           Beth? What are you doing out here?
                         
          Beth stares her down. Nina backs up, nervously grabbing her
          earlobe.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           I was crushed to hear that you're
           leaving.
                         
                          BETH
           What'd you do to get the role?
           33.
                         
          Nina shakes her head, confused.
                         
                          BETH (CONT'D)
           He always said you were a frigid
           little girl.
                         
          Her words needle Nina, too close to the truth.
                         
                          BETH (CONT'D)
           So what did you do to make him
           change his mind? Suck his cock?
                         
                          NINA
           Some of us don't need to do that.
                         
          Nina's struck a nerve. Beth starts to come at her.
                         
                          BETH
           You fucking little whore.
                         
                          NINA
                          (GUILTY)
           Beth, I'm-
                         
           LEROY (O.S.)
           What's going on?
                         
          They both turn to see Leroy returned.
                         
                          BETH
           I need to talk to you.
                         
                          LEROY
           You're drunk. You should go home.
                         
                          BETH
           Don't do that! Don't just dismiss
           me!
                         
                          LEROY
                          (EXASPERATED)
           Poor, poor little princess. Try to
           hold it together.
                         
                          BETH
           I'm going to drop by later, okay? I
           have something I want to give you.
                         
                          LEROY
                          (IGNORING HER)
           Come on.
                         
          He puts his arm around Nina, starts to lead her away.
           34.
                         
           BETH (O.S.)
           A token of my appreciation.
                         
           He ignores her and raises his arm to hail a cab. As they
           enter the cab, Beth calls after them.
                         
                          BETH (CONT'D)
           Make the most of it Nina.
                         
           Through the cab window Nina looks at Beth, troubled by her
           words.
                         
                         
          39 INT. LEROY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 39
                         
           Tasteful but spare loft. Modern and expensive furniture.
           Large windows.
                         
           Nina stands alone, looking around his inner sanctum, wide-
           eyed.
                         
           She explores the pieces of art, the furniture. She touches
           some of it, in awe.
                         
           LEROY (O.S.)
           Here.
                         
           She turns, finds Leroy holding out yet another flute of
           champagne. For himself, a scotch.
                         
                          NINA
           Thanks.
                         
           She looks up at him, expecting him to make a move. Instead,
           he walks away, and sits in a chair. He gestures for her to
           sit as well.
                         
           Confused, she sits across from him, alone on the large couch.
                         
           He takes an unceremonious sip of his drink and studies her.
           Uncomfortable, she takes a drink as well.
                         
                          LEROY
           I thought it'd be good to talk
           about the role. Ground us a little.
                         
                          NINA
           Yes.
                         
                          LEROY
           The better we get to know each
           other, the more productive we'll
           be. I don't want there to be any
           boundaries between us.
           35.
                         
                          NINA
           Me neither.
                         
                          LEROY
           Good. So, do you have a boyfriend?
                         
          She's caught off guard by his question and just smiles
          uncomfortably. He waits for an answer. Finally she manages a
          reply.
                         
                          NINA
           No...
                         
                          LEROY
           Have you had many in the past?
                         
                          NINA
           A few. But no one serious.
                         
                          LEROY
           You're not a virgin, are you?
                         
          Her expression sours at this line of questioning. She shakes
          her head.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Then there's nothing to be
           embarrassed about, is there?
           (she shakes her head)
           And you enjoy making love?
                         
                          NINA
           Excuse me?
                         
                          LEROY
           Sex. Do you enjoy it?
                         
          Blushing and feeling awkward, she takes a sip of champagne.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           We need to be able to talk about
           this.
                         
                          NINA
           Okay.
                         
                          LEROY
           So?
                         
          Nina looks at him, embarrassed, and shrugs.
                         
          He smirks, and joins her on the couch.
           36.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           I have a homework assignment for
           you.
                         
                          NINA
           Yes?
                         
                          LEROY
           Go home and masturbate. Live a
           little.
                         
           She blanches, scandalized. He finishes off his scotch and
           stands.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           It's late. Lots of work tomorrow.
           The doorman will find you a cab.
                         
           He leaves her alone in the living room.
                         
                         
          40 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 40
                         
           Nina looks at herself in the mirror, removing bobbie-pins, as
           Erica folds clothing and puts it away.
                         
                          ERICA
           Sounds like quite an evening. Wish
           I could have been there.
                         
                          NINA
           You know I asked.
                         
                          ERICA
           I know, Susie told me. Guess he
           wanted you all to himself.
                         
                          NINA
           That's not why.
                         
           Erica looks adoringly at Nina's reflection in the mirror.
                         
                          ERICA
           I don't blame him.
                         
           Erica starts to remove Nina's DIAMOND EARRINGS, but pauses.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           Where did you get these?
                         
                          NINA
           They're fake.
           37.
                         
                          ERICA
           Fooled me.
                         
           Erica removes the earrings, then walks behind Nina to unzip
           her. Nina faces her.
                         
                          NINA
           I can do it.
                         
                          ERICA
           Turn.
                         
           Nina turns back around, reticent.
                         
           ERICA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           He must have been at your side all
           night, showing you off.
                         
           Erica finishes unzipping the red dress and sees Nina's
           shoulder.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           Oh Nina...
                         
           Remembering, Nina pulls away from her.
                         
                          NINA
           It's just a rash.
                         
           Erica gruffly pulls Nina to the mirror and turns her around.
                         
                          ERICA
           What are you talking about?
                         
           Nina checks her reflection and sees the RASH, red and
           irritated from scratching.
                         
                          NINA
           It was worse a couple days ago.
           It's already getting better.
                         
                          ERICA
           You've been scratching again.
                         
                          NINA
                          NO-
                         
           Erica yanks her out of the room.
                         
                         
          41 INT. APARTMENT BATHROOM - NIGHT 41
                         
           Nina sits on the toilet, stripped to her underwear. She does
           her best to cover herself.
           38.
                         
           Erica finishes dabbing her back with HYDROGEN PEROXIDE and
           replaces the cap on the bottle.
                         
           She pulls out NAIL CLIPPERS and cuts Nina's nails down to
           their base. Each CLICK makes Nina twitch.
                         
                          ERICA
           I thought you'd outgrown this
           disgusting habit.(click) You
           haven't done it for years. (click)
                         
                          NINA
           Mom, please.
                         
           Erica grabs Nina's other hand.
                         
                          ERICA
           It's the role, isn't it? All this
           pressure... I was worried it'd be
           too much.
                         
           Nina stares at her, seething.
                         
                         
          42 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - LATER 42
                         
           Nina crawls into bed, avoiding her mother's eyes.
                         
                          ERICA
           Don't be mad at me. You know I love
           you, you know I want what's best.
           But we have to take care of you.
                         
           Nina doesn't respond.
                         
           Erica opens the JEWELRY BOX and the tinny music begins
           playing.
                         
           She hums and starts to stroke Nina's hair.
                         
           Nina tries to brush her hand away.
                         
           But Erica brings it back and keeps stroking.
                         
                         
          43 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - MORNING 43
                         
           Nina lies wide awake after a restless night.
                         
           She slowly reaches down under the covers, down between her
           legs, to complete Leroy's "homework assignment."
                         
           She closes her eyes and starts to maneuver.
           39.
                         
           She suddenly hears a RUSTLING sound and a short SNORE.
                         
           She freezes and opens her eyes. She slowly sits up in bed and
           sees Erica SLEEPING on a chair in the corner of the room.
                         
           Nina glares at her.
                         
                         
          44 INT. LARGE REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY 44
                         
           Nina waits her turn as a row of DANCERS perform grand jetes
           diagonally across the room.
                         
           She watches Veronica perform her leaps. She rejoins the
           group, giving Nina a nasty stare.
                         
           Nina avoids it, looking towards Lily, who gives her a small
           smile.
                         
           Just as Nina's turn arrives, a panicked YOUNG CORPS DANCER
           rushes in and makes a beeline for the severe ballet mistress.
                         
           Nina takes one leap and then stops dancing, sensing
           something's wrong.
                         
           The corps dancer whispers into the ballet mistress' ear. A
           look of shock on the mistress' face.
                         
           The dancer collapses into the older woman's arms.
                         
           The piano music trickles to a halt.
                         
           Nina exchanges glances with some of the other dancers.
                         
           First a few, then more dancers approach the two women,
           wanting to find out what's happened.
                         
           Nina hangs back, filled with a sinking feeling.
                         
                         
          45 EXT. LINCOLN CENTER FOUNTAIN - DAY 45
                         
           Nina sits as Leroy, worse for the wear, stares at the jets of
           water.
                         
                          NINA
           What happened?
           40.
                         
                          LEROY
           She walked into the street, got hit
           by a car.
                         
                          NINA
           Oh my god...
                         
                          LEROY
           I'm sure she did it on purpose.
                         
                          NINA
           How do you know?
                         
                          LEROY
           Everything Beth ever did came from
           within. From some dark impulse.
           It's what could make her so
           thrilling to watch. Even perfect at
           times. But also destructive.
                         
           Nina hesitates, but has to ask.
                         
                          NINA
           Was it right after we saw her?
                         
                          LEROY
           It's not your problem. This has
           nothing to do with you.
                         
           She looks away, not so sure.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Nina, don't let yourself be
           distracted. Dance is not
           immortalized like music, poetry or
           art. It lives for now. For this
           moment only. And this is your
           moment.
                         
           She attempts a nod.
                         
                         
          A46 INT. PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM - DAY A46
                         
           Beth's belongings have already been packed up and cleared.
           Guilt-ridden, Nina tries to get ready.
                         
           She picks up her duffel bag, and removes her SATCHEL. She
           unpacks its contents onto the counter: needle and thread,
           cigarettes, a makeup compact, and the tube of lipstick.
                         
           She looks over at the vase of flowers. A few have wilted.
                         
           She pulls them out to make the bouquet look fresh again.
           41.
                         
          46 INT. HOSPITAL - DAY 46
                         
           Nina exits the elevator with a BROWN SHOPPING BAG. She walks
           down a stark hallway and approaches Beth's hospital room.
                         
           Members of BETH'S FAMILY surround the bed, blocking Beth from
           view.
                         
           Nina considers going in, but shyly sulks past, drawing the
           attention of an OLDER NURSE.
                         
                          OLDER NURSE
           You can go in.
                         
                          NINA
           It's okay.
                         
           The older nurse gives her a skeptical glance and continues on
           her rounds.
                         
           Nina walks a little further and leans against the wall to
           wait.
                         
           She hears the sound of shuffling feet, looks over, and sees
           the group of people exit the room and walk down the hall,
           comforting one another.
                         
           Nina steps out from hiding and goes inside.
                         
                         
          47 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM- DAY 47
                         
           Beth is bandaged and unconscious, attached to MACHINES.
                         
           Nina stands at a distance, too intimidated to approach at
           first.
                         
           She looks around the room. It is lined with large, EXPENSIVE-
           LOOKING BOUQUETS.
                         
           She removes the flowers Leroy gave her from the brown bag,
           and sets them next to the others.
                         
           Nina slowly approaches Beth's bedside.
                         
           Beth's face is heavily wrapped with bandages. Only her closed
           eyes and pale lips can be seen.
                         
           She scans down her body, sees a sliver of her thigh, purple
           with bruises.
                         
           Curious, Nina lifts the top edge of the blanket and peeks
           underneath.
           42.
                         
           The legs are bloated and horribly bruised, pierced with large
           pins to reset the shattered bones.
                         
           She looks lower and lower, and discovers MAGGOTS feeding on
           her ankles.
                         
           Nina turns away, confronted by the Older Nurse.
                         
                          OLDER NURSE
           What are you doing?!
                         
           Nina doesn't have an answer. She just stumbles out the door.
                         
                         
          A48 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT A48
                         
           Nina steps out of her apartment into the dim hallway, lugging
           a bag of trash.
                         
           She notices some WOODEN DEBRIS from an apartment renovation
           sitting near the trash chute.
                         
           Nina drops the trash bag in the chute, then picks up a piece
           of BROKEN WOOD.
                         
           She considers it for a moment, and hides it inside the sleeve
           of her sweatshirt.
                         
                         
          B48 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - LATER B48
                         
           Nina quietly steps inside and heads towards her bedroom.
                         
           Through Erica's open bedroom door, Nina can see Erica busily
           sewing ribbon onto pointe shoes, humming to herself.
                         
           Nina quietly slips back inside her room.
                         
           She removes the wood piece and jams it between the door
           closet, creating a makeshift doorjamb
                         
           She tests it. Holds pretty well.
                         
           She hears a creek. FOOTSTEPS approach. She removes the wood
           and sticks it inside her dresser, not ready just yet.
                         
           She quickly lies down on her bed and waits to be tucked in.
                         
           The door SQUEAKS open, and Nina looks towards it.
           42A.
                         
          48A INT. PRINCIPAL REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY 48A
                         
           Nina, David, and the dancer playing ROTHBART rehearse the
           Black Swan and Prince Siegfried's Pas De Deux from Act 3.
                         
           David lifts her, then sets her down, and they lean-in towards
           each other, almost kissing.
                         
                          LEROY
           No, no, not so stiff. Don't be
           scared of him.
                         
           She pulls away from David, not at all coyly. Leroy exhales,
           frustrated.
           43-46.
                         
          48B INT. LARGE REHEARSAL SPACE - ANOTHER DAY 48B
                         
           Nina and David dance the next part of the section, looking
           more worn out.
                         
                          LEROY
           Forget about control. I want to see
           passion.
                         
           She still looks tense, not getting it.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Let it out!
                         
                         
          48C INT. LARGE REHEARSAL SPACE - ANOTHER DAY 48C
                         
           Nina practices with an OLDER BALLET MISTRESS. She
           demonstrates a movement, and Nina mimics her. The mistress
           scrutinizes, unimpressed.
                         
                         
          A49 INT. PHYSICAL THERAPIST'S OFFICE - ANOTHER DAY A49
                         
           Nina is worked over by a PHYSICAL THERAPIST. Every joint and
           muscle aches, but Nina breathes through the pain.
                         
                         
          49A INT. PRINCIPAL REHEARSAL SPACE - YET ANOTHER DAY 49A
                         
           Nina and David finish the section, completely soaked with
           sweat.
                         
           They look at Leroy, heaving breaths.
                         
                          LEROY
           David, answer me this question: are
           you interested in fucking her?
                         
           David snickers, embarrassed, shakes his head.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           No, of course not. No one would be.
                         
           Leroy comes face to face with her.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Nina, your Black Swan still looks
           no different than your White Swan.
           She's's just as...frigid.
                         
          49B Suddenly, the lights turn off, throwing them into total 49B
           darkness.
           43-46A.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Fuck!
                         
           Leroy angrily marches to the door and whips it open.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           (to someone in hall)
           Hey! We're still working in here.
           Lights back on.
                         
           There's a momentary pause, and then the lights return.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Thank you!
           (to David, Piano Player)
           Okay, you guys can go. Thank you
           for your patience.
                          (TO NINA)
           You stay.
                         
           David gives her an insinuating glance, then shakes his head.
           Very used to Leroy's "methods."
                         
                          DAVID
           Have fun.
                         
           David and the Piano Player leave them alone.
                         
          49C Leroy approaches Nina and takes her hands in his. 49C
                         
                          LEROY
           I'll be the Prince.
                         
           Made nervous by his touch, she nods.
                         
           He walks behind her and puts his hands on her waist.
                         
           He starts humming the score. And then they begin.
                         
           They do a series of lifts and spins, Leroy bracing her.
                         
           He lets go, she moves away from him.
                         
                          LEROY
           Use each finger, your face, your
           tits, everything. Entice me!
                         
           He grabs her wrist. She spins. He lets go. He grabs her other
           wrist, she spins to face him.
                         
           They get very close.
                         
           Just before they kiss she dips, pulls away.
           43-46B.
                         
          He grabs her arm again, she spins, then he stops her, her
          back to him.
                         
          He runs his hands down her arms. Slowly, seductively. She
          trembles.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Just feel my touch and respond.
                         
          She turns and leans in close, as though to kiss him... almost
          touching lips...but then she tries to push off again. He
          tightens his grip, holds her there.
                         
          She looks back at him, questioning. He looks at her
          intently, pulls her to him, and kisses her.
                         
          She melts and eagerly kisses him back. He pulls away,
          momentarily.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Slow down. Open your mouth.
                         
          She doesn't.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
                          (INSISTENT)
           Open it.
                         
          Nina follows his instruction.
                         
          The kiss grows more heated and he wraps his arms around her.
                         
          He pushes her back against the mirror. She whimpers.
                         
          He runs his hand down her body, then reaches between her
          legs. She GASPS, tries to pull his hand out, but he persists.
                         
          She throws her head back as he kisses her neck. She breathes
          deep, emits short MOANS, succumbing...
                         
          Suddenly, he pulls away from her. She looks at him confused,
          flushed and breathing hard.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           That was me seducing you. It needs
           to be the other way around.
                         
          He turns and starts to walk away. She can't believe it.
                         
                          NINA
           Please don't...
                         
          He ignores her and walks out of the room.
           47.
                         
          50A INT. PRINCIPAL REHEARSAL SPACE - LATER 50A
                         
           Nina sits on the floor, head in hands.
                         
           VOICE (O.S.)
           Hey...
                         
           Nina startles and looks up. Sees the dark figure of somebody
           watching her from the doorway. Looks like HERSELF.
                         
                          NINA
           Who's that?
                         
           Lily emerges from the darkness, dressed to leave.
                         
                          LILY
           You okay?
                         
                          NINA
           I'm fine.
                         
                          LILY
           You sure?
                         
          50B Lily sits down beside her, oblivious of Nina's desire 50B
           to be left alone.
                         
           She digs out a cigarette from her bag. Offers it to Nina.
           Nina doesn't take it.
                         
                          NINA
           We can't smoke in here.
                         
                          LILY
           I won't tell if you won't.
           48.
                         
          Nina reluctantly takes the cigarette, holds it a little
          awkwardly, clearly not a regular smoker.
                         
          Lily sparks a flame for her and then lights one for herself.
          Nina puffs, but doesn't inhale. Lily smirks.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Big day's getting closer and
           closer, huh? I can't wait. You're
           going to be amazing.
                         
                          NINA
           Thanks...
                         
          Nina wipes off her tears with her hand.
                         
                          LILY
           So, want to talk about it?
                         
                          NINA
           Just had a hard day.
                         
                          LILY
           Leroy play too rough?
                         
          Nina looks at her surprised.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           He seems like a prick.
                         
                          NINA
           He's brilliant.
                         
                          LILY
           Sure, but not exactly warm and
           fuzzy.
                         
                          NINA
           You don't know him.
                         
          Lily smirks with a realization.
                         
                          LILY
           Someone's hot for teacher.
                         
          Nina gives her a withering glance.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           It's okay. I don't blame you.
                         
          Nina stands up.
           49.
                         
                          NINA
           I should go. It's getting late.
                         
                          LILY
           Hey, I was only playing.
                         
           Nina walks towards the door.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Nina?
                         
           She ignores Lily and exits.

          52A INT. APARTMENT BATHROOM - NIGHT 52A
                         
           Nina lies in the bath, eyes closed, concentrating.
                         
           Her body jostles slightly, moving her hand between her legs,
           seeking release.
                         
           Growing frustrated, she moves more and more aggressively.
                         
           She abruptly stops and submerges herself under the water,
           defeated.
                         
           She lies still, her arms wrapped around her chest.
                         
           She opens her eyes, her vision distorted by the water.
                         
           Suddenly, her blurred Double appears, staring down at her.
                         
           Nina shoots up.
                         
           The Double is gone.
                         
           Nina scans the bathroom, but she is alone.
                         
           Nina notices some water dropping off her fingers, onto the
           lip of the tub.
                         
           Then a few drops of RED land on the white porcelain.
                         
           Worried, she examines her fingernails, which have started to
           grow back. She discovers blood and bits of skin.
           50.
                         
          52B LATER 52B
                         
           Out of the tub, Nina checks herself in the mirror. Her
           shoulder is streaked with deep SCRATCHES.
                         
           She grabs a pair of little SCISSORS from the medicine cabinet
           and starts trimming her fingernails.
                         
           She looks up at the mirror and sees her reflection snip off
           the tip of her index finger.
                         
           Nina GASPS and drops the scissors, CLANGING in the sink. Two
           of her fingers are bleeding, their tips sliced.

           Nina looks at the door, already blocked by the hamper.
                         
                          NINA
           I'll be out in a second.
                         
           She stays still, hoping she won't try to come in.
                         
           Footsteps recede and Nina breathes.
                         
           She runs her hands under some water to clean off the blood.

           David and Nina dance the Black Swan's Pas de Deux. Once
           again, Nina's rigid and self-conscious.

          They resume dancing. She finishes, out of breath, and looks
          at Leroy and the Russian ballet mistress.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)

          The piano music starts up again, and she begins dancing.
                         
          When she finishes, she looks at him, eager for feedback.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Again.
                         
          The music starts up again. Nina stays still, frustrated.
                         
                          NINA
           Do you have any corrections?
                         
                          LEROY
           No.
                         
          She doesn't understand. He gets up from his chair and goes to
          her.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Lily talked to me. Said she saw you
           crying.
                         
          Nina looks away. Can't believe Lily talked to him.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           She said you were upset and I
           should "take it easy" on you.
                         
                          NINA
           I didn't tell her that.
                         
                          LEROY
           Maybe you'd like a break for a day
           or two.

           She shouldn't have said anything!
                         
                          LEROY
           I don't care! You shouldn't be
           whining to her!

                          LEROY
           You could be brilliant. Taking it
           easy would be a betrayal.
                         
           He walks away from her.
                         
                          NINA
           I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

           Hears them chatting in their usual manner.
                         
           Nina KNOCKS loudly at the door, interrupting them.
                         
                          VERONICA
                          (RESENTFUL)
           Look who's gracing us with her
           presence...
                         
                          NINA
           Lily, I need to talk to you.
                         
                          LILY
           Okay...
                         
                          NINA
           Now.
           53.
                         
                          VERONICA
           (you're in trouble)
           Ooooh.
                         
           The other girls giggle.
                         
                          LILY
           Shut up.
                         
           And they do.
                         
                         
          57 INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - DAY 57
                         
           Nina leads Lily to a private nook, fuming.
                         
                          LILY
           What's wrong?
                         
                          NINA
           You told Thomas about last night?
                         
           Lily falters, guilty.
                         
                          LILY
           I ran into him this morning. He
           said you guys were having some
           trouble.
                         
                          NINA
           Why would he talk to you?
                         
                          LILY
           Whoa your highness, I just told him
           you're working your ass off and I'm
           sure you'll be great.
                         
                          NINA
           You shouldn't have done that.
                         
                          LILY
           I didn't fucking do anything.
                         
           Lily takes off. Nina stares after her, at a loss.
                         
                         
          A58 INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT A58
                         
           Nina sits on the subway, going home. She notices that one of
           her fingernails has a jagged edge. She removes an EMORY BOARD
           from her bag and begins filing it down.
                         
           A SKEEZY MAN across the aisle ogles her.
           54.
                         
           Nina keeps her eyes down, trying to ignore him. He starts to
           sing an OLD LOVE SONG from the 20's.
                         
           Nina stands and goes to the other end of the car. He
           continues singing, undeterred.
                         
                         
                         58 OMITTED 58
                         
                         
          59 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - NIGHT 59
                         
           Nina sits on the floor in a loose sweatshirt, sewing ribbon 
           onto pointe shoes. 
                         
           Erica sits across from her, sewing ribbon onto another pair. 
                         
                          ERICA
           Has he tried anything with you?
                         
           Nina doesn't respond. 
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           He has a reputation...
                         
           Nina tries to ignore her.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           I have a right to be concerned,
           Nina. You've been staying late so
           many nights. "Rehearsing." I hope
           he's not taking advantage, that's
           all.
                         
                          NINA
           He's not. 
                         
                          ERICA
           Good. I don't want you making the
           same mistake I did.
                         
                          NINA
                          (INSULTED)
           Thanks.
                         
                          ERICA
           Not like that. I just mean as far
           as my career was concerned.
                         
                          NINA
           What career?
                         
                          ERICA
           The one I gave up to have you.
           55.
                         
                          NINA
           You were 28.
                         
                          ERICA
           So?
                         
                          NINA
           And only...
                         
          Nina bites her tongue.
                         
                          ERICA
           Only what?
                         
                          NINA
           Nothing.
                         
                          ERICA
           What?
                         
                          NINA
                          (DEFIANT)
           Nothing.
                         
          Erica glares at her.
                         
                          ERICA
           How's your skin?
                         
                          NINA
           It's fine.
                         
                          ERICA
           We leaving it alone?
                         
                          NINA
           Yes.
                         
                          ERICA
           Let me see. 
                         
          Nina stares back defiantly. 
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D) 
           Take off your shirt. 
                         
                          NINA 
           No. 
                         
          Erica starts to come towards her. 
                         
          The DOORBELL RINGS. 
                         
          Erica looks at Nina questioningly. Nina shakes her head.
           56.
                         
           Erica goes to the door and cracks it open, keeping the chain
           engaged.
                         
                          ERICA
           (to person outside)
           Can I help you? (pause) I'm sorry,
           she's not in.
                         
           Erica shuts the door. Nina rushes out to see who it was.
                         
                          NINA
           Who was it?
                         
           Erica doesn't answer.
                         
           Irritated, Nina walks around Erica and quickly opens the door
           to find out.
                         
                          ERICA
           It's no one.
                         
                         
          60 INT. BUILDING HALLWAY- NIGHT 60
                         
           Nina sees a ballerina walking away from the door.
                         
                          NINA
           Hello?
                         
           Lily turns.
                         
                          LILY
           Hey.
                         
                          NINA
                          (SUSPICIOUS)
           What are you doing here?
                         
           Nina steps out of her apartment and closes the door.
                         
                          LILY
           I wanted to apologize.
                         
           Nina just stares, incredulous.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           You were right, I shouldn't have
           talked to him about you.
                         
           Erica opens the door and sticks her head out.
                         
                          ERICA
           Sweetheart?
           57.
                         
                          NINA
           Give me a second.
                         
                          ERICA
           Your dinner...
                         
                          NINA
           Mom, please!
                         
          Erica closes the door.
                         
                          LILY
           She's a trip...
                         
                          NINA
           How did you know where I live?
                         
                          LILY
           I have my ways.
                         
          Nina looks at her, darkly.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Relax, I got it from Susie in the
           office. I feel really shitty. Can I
           make it up to you? Take you out to
           dinner?
                         
                          NINA
           I don't think-
                         
                          LILY
           A drink?
                         
          Nina's tempted. Erica pokes her head out again.
                         
                          ERICA
           Sweetie, you need to rest.
                         
                          LILY
           Jesus.
                         
          Nina pushes the elevator call button.
                         
                          NINA
                          (TO LILY)
           Wait.
                         
          Nina walks to the door, and grabs her coat.
                         
                          ERICA
           What are you doing?
           58.
                         
                          NINA
           I'm going out.
                         
                          ERICA
           What?
                         
           Nina ignores her and shuts the door.
                         
                          NINA
                          (TO LILY)
           Let's go.
                         
                         
          61 INT. CORNER BISTRO - NIGHT 61
                         
           A noisy bar and burger joint, packed to the brim. Lily and
           Nina sit at a small table.
                         
                          LILY
           Can't believe that's what he called
           her. So gross!
                         
                          NINA
           I think it's sweet.
                         
                          LILY
           Little princess? He probably calls
           every girl that.
                         
                          NINA
           Only Beth.
                         
                          LILY
           Well, I'm sure she lost the title
           after her game of chicken.
                         
           Nina's smile fades.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Bet he'll be calling you little
           princes any day now.
                         
                          NINA
           I don't think so.
           59.
                         
                          LILY
           Sure, just gotta let him eat the
           pussy.
                         
          Nina blushes, embarrassed, and Lily cracks up. A WAITER drops
          a plate in front of her.
                         
                          WAITER
                          (TO LILY)
           Cheese burger, extra bloody.
                         
                          LILY
           Danke schoen.
                         
                          WAITER
           Let me know if it's not juicy
           enough.
                         
                          LILY
           Oh, I will.
                         
          He smiles, keeping his eyes locked on Lily, as he rudely
          plops down Nina's plate.
                         
                          WAITER
           Enjoy.
                         
          Lily watches him go, then notices Nina looking annoyed.
                         
                          LILY
           What?
                         
                          NINA
           Guess I'm invisible.
                         
          Lily studies her and digs into her purse. Pulls out a SEXY
          SHIRT.
                         
                          LILY
           Here, wanna spruce up?
                         
          Nina gives her a puzzled look.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           I always carry a spare, case I wake
           up somewhere unexpected.
                         
          Lily picks up her ungainly burger and takes a big bite, a
          little grease dripping down her chin. Nina cuts into her dry
          chicken breast.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Not like you need more attention
           these days. How is he?
           60.
                         
          Nina doesn't understand the question.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Thomas?
                         
                          NINA
           I wouldn't know.
                         
                          LILY
           Yeah, right.
                         
                          NINA
           I don't want to talk about it.
                         
                          LILY
           Relax, you're so tense.
                         
          Lily pulls out a cigarette case and clicks it open. Inside,
          CIGARETTES and a couple PILLS.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           One for you...
                         
          Lily grabs one of the pills and slides it over.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           And one for me.
                         
          Lily grabs her pill and downs it with a beer.
                         
          Nina stares at her pill, too embarrassed to admit she doesn't
          know what it is.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Don't worry, it's pure. Brought it
           with me straight from San
           Francisco.
                         
                          NINA
           What is it?
                         
                          LILY
           You're kidding? You never rolled?
                         
          Nina blinks.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Oh boy. It'll just make you have a
           good time. Loosen up. See the night
           sky.
                         
                          NINA
                          (CURIOUS)
           How long does it last?
           61.
                         
                          LILY
           Couple hours. Tops.
                         
           Nina looks at the pill, thinks about it for a second...
                         
                          NINA
           That's okay.
                         
                          LILY
           Sure?
                         
           Nina nods. Lily puts the pill back, and SNAPS the case
           closed.
                         
                         
          62 INT. GRUNGY BATHROOM - NIGHT 62
                         
           Wearing the SKIMPY SHIRT Lily offered her, Nina rinses her
           mouth out with water from the sink, then checks herself out
           in the mirror.
                         
           It's broken and covered with graffiti and stickers. One
           particularly bright one says, "Seize the Day-glo."
                         
           Nina's cell phone RINGS. She checks the ID--"MOM"--and
           silences it.
                         
           Nina puts her SWEATSHIRT back on over the shirt, and exits.
                         
                         
          63 INT. CORNER BISTRO - NIGHT 63
                         
           Nina returns to her table, but when she gets there, Lily is
           gone and the table is cleared.
                         
           She looks around the crowded room, doesn't see her anywhere.
                         
           She heads towards the exit, and sees Lily at the bar,
           flirting with TWO ATTRACTIVE MEN. She's very touchy-feely.
                         
           Intrigued, Nina stays put, wanting to observe Lily from a
           distance.
                         
           The BARTENDER sets a drink down in front of Lily. The men
           compete to pay for it.
                         
           Lily takes out the CIGARETTE CASE from her purse, and removes
           the pill.
                         
           Nina looks on, suspicious.
                         
           Lily opens the pill, and dumps its contents into the drink.
           She stirs it with her finger.
           62.
                         
          She holds out her finger to one of the men, he sucks off the
          liquid.
                         
          Lily looks over and catches Nina watching. She waves for her
          to join them.
                         
          Nina reluctantly walks to her.
                         
                          LILY
           Heeey, thought we could use some
           drinks.
                         
                          NINA
           I'm gonna go.
                         
                          LILY
           This is Tom and this is Jerry.
                         
          The guys laugh.
                         
                          ANDREW
           Actually it's Andrew.
                         
                          TOM
           Tom.
                         
                          NINA
           Hi.
                         
                          LILY
           You can't leave, I bought you a
           drink.
                         
          Lily holds out the doctored beverage. Nina eyes it, tempted
          to go down the rabbit hole...
                         
                          NINA
           I really shouldn't, we're on the
           stage tomorrow.
                         
                          LILY
           What, you gonna go home to mommy?
           Live a little.
                         
          Nina grins sheepishly and takes the drink. Lily smiles.
                         
                          NINA
           Just a couple of hours?
                         
                          LILY
           Tops.
                         
          Nina takes a tiny sip.
           63.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Go on.
                         
           Nina takes another sip and smiles.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Let's go sit somewhere a little
           more comfortable. Gentlemen?
                         
           She gets up and holds out her hands. The two men each grab
           one and she leads them deeper into the bar.
                         
                         
          64 INT. CORNER BISTRO - MOMENTS LATER 64
                         
           Nina's drink is half gone. The foursome sits snugly at a
           booth. Nina next to Andrew, shyly avoiding his gaze. She
           takes another tentative sip of her drink.
                         
                          ANDREW
           You haven't told me who you are.
                         
                          NINA
           Oh, I'm a dancer.
                         
                          ANDREW
           No, I mean your name.
                         
                          NINA
           Nina.
                         
                          TOM
           You two sisters?
                          LILY NINA
           Yes. No.
                         
                          ANDREW
           Well?
                         
                          LILY
           We're blood sisters.
                         
                          NINA
           We dance in the same company.
                         
                          TOM
                          (PLEASED)
           Ahh, ballerinas. So that's why you
           look alike.
                         
                          LILY
           Tom and Jerry are gay lovers.
           64.
                         
                          TOM
           Very funny.
                         
                          LILY
           Oh, I just assumed.
                         
                          ANDREW
           I've never been to the ballet.
                         
                          LILY
           In that case you're definitely NOT
           gay.
                         
                          TOM
           It's pretty boring, isn't it?
                         
                          NINA
                          (OFFENDED)
           No, it's not.
                         
                          LILY
                          (FLIRTY)
           It's not for everyone. You probably
           aren't sophisticated enough.
                         
                          TOM
           You've got some mouth, you know
           that?
                         
                          LILY
           Isn't that compliment a little
           premature?
                         
          Lily sips her drink, staring at Tom flirtatiously.
                         
                          NINA
           You guys should come sometime. I
           can comp you tickets.
                         
          Tom laughs, amused by Nina's earnestness.
                         
                          TOM
           Yeah...that'd be neat.
                         
                          LILY
           I think we all need another round.
           Bottom's up.
                         
          She looks at Nina and sucks down her drink, challenging her
          to follow suit. Nina takes a breath of courage and empties
          her glass.
                         
          She waits for something to kick in.
           65.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Tom, come with me?
                         
          Lily slips out of the booth and Tom follows, leaving Nina and
          Andrew alone. She avoids his gaze, nervous.
                         
                          ANDREW
           So...what are you guys working on
           these days?
                         
          Her cell phone RINGS, interrupting him. She quickly turns it
          off and gives him an embarrassed smile.
                         
                          NINA
           Sorry. Swan Lake.
                         
                          ANDREW
           Yeah?
                         
                          NINA
           You know it?
                         
                          ANDREW
           Oh, no, not really. Heard of it
           though. What's it about?
                         
                          NINA
           It's about a girl who's been turned
           into a swan. She needs love to
           break the spell.
                         
                          ANDREW
           Okay.
                         
                          NINA
           Yeah, but her prince falls for the
           wrong girl and she kills herself.
                         
                          ANDREW
           So a happy ending, then?
                         
                          NINA
           It's beautiful, actually.
                         
                          ANDREW
           Like you.
                         
          She starts to feel the initial tingles of the drug.
                         
                          NINA
           Huh?
                         
                          ANDREW
           I said you're beautiful.
           66.
                         
           She giggles.
                         
                          ANDREW (CONT'D)
           That funny?
                         
           She gives him a flirtatious glance.
                         
                          NINA
           My hands are all sweaty.
                         
           Andrew touches them. She grabs onto his hands. She looks at
           his face. His eyes twinkle at her.
                         
           Lily slides in next to her. Nina sees her and melts into her
           body. Lily hugs her back.
                         
                          LILY
           Uh oh! Looks like someone's
           rolling. Let's get you dancing.

           Nina kisses Tom on the floor of a crowded dance club. The
           drug is in full effect.
                         
           The world has soft edges, colors are vivid and bleed into one
           another.
                         
           Lily twirls her around.
                         
           Nina attaches herself to her, hungry for the attention. A
           cheering section of guys surrounds them.
                         
           Nina lets loose. Dances with abandon.
                         
                         
          66 INT. CLUB BATHROOM - LATER 66
                         
           Nina makes out with someone, her back pushed up against the
           wall. Her eyes are closed, she's shiny with sweat.
                         
           She opens her eyes, confused to find that it's not Andrew or
           even Tom, just a STRANGE MAN.
                         
           She backs away. He reaches for her, but she swats him off.

          67 INT. DANCE CLUB - SAME 67
                         
           She stumbles around the dance floor, looking for Lily, but
           only sees a mass of moving bodies.
                         
           She finally spots a girl that looks like her from behind.
           Nina grabs her shoulder and the GIRL spins around. Not Lily.
                         
                         
          68 EXT. DANCE CLUB - LATER 68
                         
           Nina pushes her way out of the club, starting to panic. She
           looks around, trying to figure out where she is, but the city
           is dark and non-descript.
                         
           LILY (O.S.)
           Nina!
                         
           Nina turns towards the voice and, with relief, sees Lily exit
           the club.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Where you goin'?
                         
                         
          69 INT. TAXI - NIGHT 69
                         
           Nina stares adoringly at Lily, who has her eyes closed,
           enjoying the cool air blowing in from her open window.
                         
           Lily opens her eyes and catches Nina staring. Lily smirks.
                         
           Using her index and middle finger as "legs," she "walks" her
           hand over the vinyl seat, all the way to Nina's leg and pokes
           it.
                         
           Nina watches her hand with a smile on her face, glances at
           Lily.
                         
           Lily smiles back, and then "walks" her hand up the leg, until
           it reaches the edge of Nina's dress.
                         
           Lily looks at Nina questioningly. Nina doesn't protest.
                         
           Lily slips her hand underneath the dress, gently makes
           contact...
                         
           Nina shudders, but pulls Lily's hand back out and holds it.
                         
           Lily snickers and looks out her window.
                         
           Nina looks at their clasped hands, then out her own window,
           happy.

           Nina quietly opens the front door.
                         
           Lily GIGGLES. Nina SHUSHES her.
                         
           They slip off their shoes and tip-toe inside.

           Nina eases the door shut.
                         
           Lily taps her on the shoulder and points towards the hallway.
                         
           Erica emerges from the darkness, approaching them slowly.
           Distraught.
                         
                          ERICA
           Do you have any idea what time it
           is?

           To the moon and back.
                         
                          ERICA
           You've been drinking.

           Ding ding ding.
                         
           Lily snickers, Nina tries to keep a straight face, but ends
           up laughing.
                         
                          ERICA

           Huh?
                         
                          ERICA
           What else have you been doing?
                         
           Nina smiles coyly.
                         
                          NINA
           You want to know their names?

           Erica grabs Nina's wrist.
                         
                          ERICA
           You need to sleep it off.

           There were two. Tom and Jerry...
                         
                          ERICA
           Be quiet, Nina.

                          (GIGGLING)
           I fucked both of them.

           Shut your mouth!
                         
           Erica violently jams her fingers over Nina's lips, trying to
           silence her.
                         
           Nina runs into her room and SLAMS the door.
                         
                         
          72A INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - SAME 72A
                         
           She grabs the broken PIECE OF WOOD from the dresser and jams
           the door. She backs Lily away, preparing for the storm.
                         
                          NINA
           Don't come in here!
                         
           Erica tries to open the door, but it gets stuck. She peers
           her eye through the crack.
                         
                          ERICA
           What's this?

           It's called privacy! I'm not
           fucking twelve years old anymore!
                         
           Erica struggles a little with the door, but can't get it to
           budge.

           Nina SHOVES the door shut.
                         
           Erica's FOOTSTEPS retreat, followed by the SLAM of her
           bedroom door.
                         
          72B Nina is worked up, breathing hard. 72B
                         
           LILY (O.S.)
           Whoa...
                         
           Nina turns around and sees her Double smiling at her.
                         
           Nina flees to the door. Pauses. She peeks back and sees that
           it's actually Lily.
                         
           Relieved, she grabs Lily and kisses her, revved-up.
                         
           Lily responds with equal force. They claw at each other,
           passion exceeding coordination.
                         
           Lily pulls Nina's shirt off and throws her onto the bed.
                         
           She straddles Nina, who looks up at her carnivorously.
                         
           Lily takes her own top off, plunges down and kisses Nina.
                         
           Nina flips Lily over, becomes the dominant one.
                         
           Lily scratches Nina's back, over some of the rash.
                         
           There's subtle movement underneath the skin. Little pin
           pricks push up the flesh, trailing behind her hand.
                         
           Self-conscious, Nina grabs Lily's hand and holds her wrists
           down.
                         
           She bites her neck. Lily smiles, likes the violence.
                         
           She digs her nails into Nina's hands.
                         
           Then Lily gets back on top of Nina. The tattooed lilies on
           her back undulate and spread out. Morphing into dark wings.
                         
           She kisses down Nina's body. Further and further...
           71.
                         
           Lily starts to go down on Nina.
                         
           Nervous, Nina whimpers. Glances down and sees the DOUBLE.
                         
           She tries to pull away.
                         
           LILY shushes her.
                         
           Nina calms back down, seeing that it's her. She takes a
           breath and succumbs.
                         
           Bumps shoot up all over her skin as her breath quickens.
                         
           She closes her eyes, allows the sensation to invade her body
           and CLIMAXES.
                         
           She breathes her way back to earth. Slowly her eyes open.
           She rolls over towards Lily. But Lily is gone.
                         
           Instead her DOUBLE hovers over her.
                         
                          DOUBLE
           Sweet girl.
                         
           She SMASHES a pillow over Nina's face.

           Nina lies alone in bed, the sheets and comforter in disarray.
                         
           She sits up, clutches her head in pain.
                         
           She looks around, but there's no sign of Lily or the Double.
                         
           Then her eyes drift to the alarm clock: 11:36.
           72.
                         
           She snaps out of bed.
                         
                         
          74 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - MORNING 74
                         
           Dishevelled, Nina races towards the front door. She sees
           Erica brooding at the kitchen table, watching her.
                         
                          NINA
           Why didn't you wake me up?
                         
           Erica just stares at her, devastated.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           I'm moving out.
                         
           Nina whips out the front door and leaves her.
                         
                         
          75 INT. BACKSTAGE - DAY 75
                         
           Nina races. She hears muffled Black Swan music playing,
           rehearsal clearly in progress.
                         
                          NINA
                          (TO HERSELF)
           My music.
                         
           She runs into the wings and sees the full company rehearsing
           on stage for the first time...
                         
           Another girl dancing her part.
                         
           The girl spins and Nina sees her face. It's Lily!
                         
           Horrified, Nina runs onto
                         
                         
                         76 STAGE 76
                         
           and makes a beeline for Leroy, looking beyond apologetic.
                         
           The dancers and piano player stop at the interruption.
                         
                          LEROY
           Keep going. Let's finish the Act.
                         
           The piano music resumes, and the dancers pick up where they
           left off.
           73.
                         
          Nina meets Lily's eyes. She makes a sorry face, but then
          continues dancing.
                         
          Nina is forced to watch from the sidelines as Lily and David
          finish the Black Swan's Pas de Deux.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           That was good. Let's take 10, then
           we'll move on to Act 4.
                         
          He turns to Nina and his smile fades.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Get warmed up.
                         
                          NINA
           Thomas, I'm sor-
                         
          He ignores her, and walks off stage.
                         
          Lily tentatively approaches with the PRACTICE TUTU.
                         
                          LILY
           Hey...
                         
          Nina snatches it, avoiding eye contact. She puts it on.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           He wanted to go through the
           spacing. Asked me to step in.
                         
          Nina starts stretching.
                         
                          NINA
                          (LOADED)
           I overslept.
                         
                          LILY
           Oops... Least you had a good time,
           right?
                         
          Nina doesn't answer.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Hello?
                         
                          NINA
           You put something in my drink.
           74-76.
                         
                          LILY
                          (OBVIOUSLY)
           Yeah...
                         
                          NINA
           And took off this morning.
                         
                          LILY
           This morning?
                         
                          NINA
           Yeah, you slept over.
                         
                          LILY
           Uh, no. Unless your name's Tom and
           you have a dick.
                         
                          NINA
           But we...
                         
          Nina stops herself.
                         
                          LILY
           We what, Nina?
                         
          Lily can read something on her face.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           What, you have some kind of lezzy
           wet dream?
                         
          Nina glances at the dancers, nervous they've heard.
                         
                          NINA
           You're lying.
                         
                          LILY
                          (TICKLED)
           Oh my god, you totally fantasized
           about me.
                         
                          NINA
           Stop.
                         
                          LILY
           Was I good?
                         
                          NINA
                          (BARKS)
           Shut up!
                         
          Other dancers look over.
                         
          Nina resumes stretching. Lily just walks away.
           74-76A.
                         
          A77 INT. STAGE - DAY A77
                         
           Nina dances the end of the ballet, the White Swan's suicide.
                         
                          LEROY
           The Black Swan has stolen your
           love. There's only one way to end
           the pain.
                         
           Nina climbs the stairs of the set and arrives at the "cliff,"
           stopping at the precipice.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           You're not at all fearful. Filled
           with acceptance.
                         
           Nina looks down. It's a short drop to a stack of pads, but a
           HARD FLOOR surrounds it.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           You look at the Prince, then down
           at Rothbart, and, yes, up at the
           audience...And jump!
                         
           She hesitates, fearful.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Go ahead. You'll be fine.
                         
           Nina takes a breath and leaps in a swan dive.
                         
           She falls...and lands in the pads, unhurt. Slight applause
           from the other dancers.
                         
           LEROY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           Everybody get a drink then it's
           notes.
                         
           Nina lies in the pads, completely exhausted.
                         
                         
          B77 INT. BACKSTAGE - LATER B77
                         
           Nina sits backstage, toweling herself off.
                         
           She pauses, noticing Leroy and Lily conversing near the
           doorway.
                         
           Lily nods and touches his arm. He smiles warmly, then notices
           Nina watching. His serious demeanor returns and he pulls
           away. He says goodbye to Lily.
                         
           Lily follows his gaze and smirks at Nina, rubbing it in,
           before exiting herself.
           74-76B.

          A81 INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT A81
                         
           Nina kneels in front of the toilet, a finger down her throat.
           She gags, but nothing comes up.
                         
           Her eyes tear up, and she tries again, but still just heaves.
                         
           Frustrated, she wipes her mouth and flushes.
                         
                         
          81 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - NIGHT 81
                         
           Nina exits the bathroom and approaches her mother's bedroom
           door. It's closed, but the light's on underneath.
                         
           She's about to knock, but hesitates. Through the door, she
           can hear the sound of her mother watching an INFOMERCIAL on
           TV. An unfamiliar, lonely noise.
                         
           Nina stands there for a moment, just breathing. She
           strengthens her resolve and backs away from the door.
                         
                         
          82 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 82
                         
           Nina collapses on her bed.
                         
           She opens the JEWELRY BOX sitting on her night stand.
                         
           She watches the ballerina spin for a moment...
                         
           Then suddenly SLAMS the lid shut and throws the box hard
           against the wall.
                         
           She shoots out of bed and starts gathering all her childish
           possessions--stuffed animals, dolls, keepsakes, etc.
                         
                         
          83 INT. APARTMENT CORRIDOR - NIGHT 83
                         
           Nina shoves her belongings into the TRASH CHUTE, a pile of
           her next victims strewn at her feet.
                         
           She grabs a TEDDY BEAR IN A TUTU, and jams him in.
           77-78A.
                         
          A84 INT. STAGE - DAY A84
                         
           Nina dances the Black Swan in front of the nearly completed
           scenery.
                         
           A few TECHNICIANS complete last minute touch-ups.
                         
           Leroy watches from his down-stage post, his focus split
           between her and...
                         
           Lily, stretching with the other ballerinas. She stares at
           Nina with a dark expression.
                         
           Fueled by the competition, Nina pushes herself. Her dancing
           becomes more impassioned and aggressive.
                         
           She finishes the section, breathing deeply, covered in sweat.
           The company enthusiastically claps.
                         
           She stares intently at Leroy, awaiting his response.
                         
                          LEROY
           At last, I saw the Black Swan.
                         
                         
          B84 INT. COSTUME SHOP - DAY B84
                         
           Nina wears the BLACK SWAN COSTUME, facing a mirror. Another
           mirror behind her creates an infinite array of reflections.
                         
           The overworked COSTUMER checks each seam, pulling the costume
           taut, analyzing what needs to be taken in and let out.
                         
           Nina looks uncomfortable, disliking the scrutiny of her body.
                         
           She hears a sharp RUSTLE. Like someone's scratching.
                         
           She looks up at the mirror. Her reflection stares back.
                         
           Behind the first reflection, another Nina has her arm behind
           her back, like she's scratching her shoulder.
                         
           Nina leans to get a better look...
                         
                          COSTUMER
           Sit still, I'm almost done.
                         
           Nina startles. The reflection has returned to normal, its
           hand back at its side.
                         
           Costumer checks one more thing, makes one more note.
                         
                          COSTUMER (CONT'D)
           Okay, all set.
           77-78B.
                         
           The costumer leaves her to change.
                         
           Relieved, Nina quickly takes off the costume and starts to
           dress in her sweats.
                         
           She hears someone enter the costume shop.
                         
           LILY (O.S.)
           Hey...Thomas sent me.
                         
           Nina pauses, recognizing her voice.
                         
           COSTUMER (O.S.)
           Yeah, need to get you measured for
           your Swan Queen costumes.
                         
           Nina steps out from behind the privacy curtain, and finds
           Lily waiting.
                         
                          NINA
                          (TO COSTUMER)
           What's she doing here?
                         
                          LILY
           He made me your alternate.
           (can't help it)
           Just in case...
                         
           Nina pushes past her.
                         
                         
          C84 INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - DAY C84
                         
           Nina chases after Leroy, in mid-conversation with the STAGE
           MANAGER and two STAGEHANDS.
                         
                          NINA
           Thomas!
                         
           He stops and faces her.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           She's trying to replace me.
                         
                          LEROY
           (to stage manager,
                          STAGEHANDS)
           Go ahead. I'll catch up.
                         
           They continue walking.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           What's going on?
           77-78C.
                         
                          NINA
           Lily. You made her my alternate.
                         
                          LEROY
           There's always an alternate, you
           know that. Lily's the best choice.
                         
                          NINA
           She wants my role.
                         
                          LEROY
           Every dancer in the world wants
           your role.
                         
                          NINA
           No, she's different. She's after
           me. She's trying to replace me.
                         
                          LEROY
                          (CONDESCENDING)
           Nina...
                         
                          NINA
           Please believe me.
                         
           He studies her for a moment, not sure what to make of this.
                         
                          LEROY
           Listen, I know it's been a
           struggle. But you had a
           breakthrough this morning.
                         
           Nina starts to speak, he holds up his hand to silence her.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Tomorrow is yours. Give a great
           performance, and you won't have to
           worry about Lily, or anyone else.
                         
                          NINA
                          THOMAS-
                         
                          LEROY
           No more. Go home and rest.
                         
           Shut down, she watches him walk away.
                         
                         
                         84 OMITTED 84
           79.
                         
                         
                         
                         
          85A INT. PRINCIPAL REHEARSAL SPACE - NIGHT 85A
                         
           Nina practices the Black Swan, alone with the jaded piano
           player, working herself hard.
                         
           He suddenly stops playing.
                         
                          NINA
           What happened?
                         
                          PIANO PLAYER
           I gotta life, deary.
                         
           He closes the music book and stands.
                         
           PIANO PLAYER (CONT'D)
           Don't work too hard. It's your big
           day tomorrow.
                         
           Annoyed, she watches him leave.
                         
          85B She faces herself in the mirror and takes a breath. 85B
                         
           She resumes dancing without music, her feet CLICKING on the
           floor.
                         
           As she moves, she notices something strange out of the corner
           of her eye:
                         
           The reflection's dancing lags a little behind hers.
                         
           Nina stops. The sound of her footsteps stops a second later.
           She stares at the mirror...troubled.
                         
           The door to the room BANGS shut.
                         
           She whips towards it and she's suddenly plunged into
           DARKNESS.
                         
           Freaked, she stumbles towards the door, and pushes out into
                          THE
           80.
                         
          86A INT. STAGE - NIGHT 86A
                         
           Where it's equally dark. Lit only by the stage's "ghost
           light," a single bulb on a stand.
                         
                          NINA
           Hey! Hey! I'm still in here.
                         
           No one answers.
                         
           She looks at the cavernous auditorium. All those empty
           seats, faced towards her. Very overwhelming...
                         
           She hears a noise in the wings.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           Hey! Turn the lights back on!
                         
           She gets to the other side of the stage, but the wings seem
           empty. Quiet.
                         
          86B Then she hears the faint sound of MUFFLED BANGING. 86B
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           Hello?
                         
           No one answers.
                         
           She heads towards the noise. The banging now accompanied by a
           GIGGLE.
                         
                         
          87 INT. WINGS - SAME 87
                         
           It's pretty dark but the sound is unmistakable: two people
           going at it.
                         
           Nina tiptoes past some off-stage SETS and LIGHTING EQUIPMENT.
                         
           And peeks around a piece of SCENERY...
                         
           Catching a glimpse of Leroy fucking Lily further backstage.
           She's wild, clearly enjoying it.
                         
           Nina looks away, disgusted. She peeks back one more time.
                         
           Leroy has become the demon Rothbart, ravishing the Double.
           She meets Nina's eyes and smiles.
                         
           Nina jumps back, knocking into a piece of the set. The
           lovemaking pauses at the sound.
                         
           Nina flees.
           81.
                         
          A88 INT. PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT A88
                         
           Nina runs in and quickly jams her belongings into her bag.
                         
           She notices her reflection in the mirror and removes her
           diamond earrings.
                         
           Then gathers the other trinkets sitting on the counter and
           puts them all inside her bag.
                         
                         
          B88 EXT. THEATER - NIGHT B88
                         
           Nina pushes out the stage door, and passes the ROW OF
           POSTERS.
                         
           They now advertise Swan Lake and feature a beautiful
           photograph of Nina.
                         
           Nina stops and looks at them.
                         
                         
          88 INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT 88
                         
           Nina slowly enters Beth's room, but remains at the threshold.
                         
           Beth sits in a wheelchair faced towards the window. Sleeping.
                         
           Nina gets up the nerve and quietly walks further in, trying
           not to wake her.
                         
           Nina pulls out the tube of lipstick from her bag and gently
           places it on the hospital table.
                         
           She pulls out the diamond earrings, sets them down.
                         
           Followed by the makeup compact, the pack of cigarettes, a
           needle and thread, and an emory board.
                         
           A hand suddenly GRABS Nina's arm.
                         
           Awake, Beth stares Nina down.
                         
                          BETH
           What are you doing here?
                         
           Stunned, Nina's unable to answer.
                         
           Beth follows her gaze to the random items on her table.
                         
                          NINA
           I'm so sorry.
                         
           Beth begins touching the objects, vaguely remembering.
           82.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           I didn't mean to make you feel this
           way. It's happening to me now.
           She's trying to replace me.
                         
          Beth sees the earrings and it all clicks in.
                         
                          BETH
           You stole all these things?
                         
                          NINA
           I just wanted to be like you.
           Perfect.
                         
          Beth shoots Nina a dark look and turns away.
                         
                          BETH
           I'm not perfect. I'm nothing.
                         
                          NINA
           It's not true.
                         
                          BETH
           Fucking nothing!
                         
          Beth grabs the emory board and stabs herself in the face.
                         
                          BETH (CONT'D)
           Nothing! Nothing!!!
                         
                          NINA
           Beth?!
                         
          Nina spins Beth around. She is now a bloody version of THE
          DOUBLE! She continues stabbing herself.
                         
          Nina grabs the Double's hand and struggles to restrain her.
                         
                          DOUBLE
           NOTHING!
                         
                          NINA
           Stop it! Stop!
                         
          The emory board stabs into Nina's arm.
                         
          Nina rushes from the room.
           83.
                         
          89 INT. HALLWAY - SAME 89
                         
           She BANGS into a empty stretcher sitting in the hallway,
           causing a CLAMOR.
                         
           The older nurse looks up.
                         
           Nina jumps into an open elevator.
                         
                         
          90 INT. HOSPITAL ELEVATOR - SAME 90
                         
           She hits the GROUND FLOOR BUTTON, and hides in the corner.
                         
           As the doors close, she looks down and sees that, in one
           hand, she holds the BLOODY EMORY BOARD.
                         
           She drops it, disgusted.
                         
                         
          91 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - NIGHT 91
                         
           Nina runs in and quickly shuts the door behind her. Takes a
           breath, and notices some blood still on her hands.
                         
                         
          A92 INT. KITCHEN - SAME A92
                         
           She flips on the light. The room's empty.
                         
           She goes to the sink and washes her hands.
                         
           She finishes, and flips the light off as she walks out of the
           room.
                         
           She pauses, rushes back and flips on the light. The Double
           stares at her from the corner, her face covered in blood.
           Terrified, Nina runs.
                         
                         
          B92 INT. BATHROOM - SAME B92
                         
           She goes straight to the toilet and VOMITS.
                         
           She hears a creaking sound in the apartment and looks towards
           the open door.
                         
                          NINA
           Mommy?!
                         
           She goes out to investigate.
           83A.
                         
          92 INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - SAME 92
                         
           Nina flings open the door, but Erica's not in there.
                         
           She hears RUSTLING, then WHISPERING.
                         
           Nina looks around the room. The paintings of herself seem to
           move slightly. Blink. Mouths move.
                         
           They whisper: "Sweet girl" and then start chanting "My turn,
           my turn, my turn!"
                         
           Nina cups her hands over her ears, trying to block it out.
                         
           She hears a BANG and looks towards the door. No one's there.
                         
           She glimpses the mirror, which reflects down the hallway. She
           sees her Double rushing towards the room.
                         
           Scared, Nina whips around, just as her mother arrives in the
           doorway.
           84.
                         
                          ERICA
           What are you doing?
                         
           Nina pushes past her, in a frenzy.
                         
                         
          93 INT. BEDROOM - SAME 93
                         
           Nina closes the door. Sticks in the broken piece of wood.
                         
           A pain shoots through her shoulder. She SCREAMS,
           instinctively reaching for it.
                         
           She quickly yanks off the sweater and looks at the vanity
           mirror.
                         
           Her back pulsates unnaturally. Tiny black tips poke through.
                         
           The door opens and catches on the doorjamb.
                         
           Erica starts POUNDING.
                         
                          NINA
           GO AWAY!
                         
           She digs into the open bump on her shoulder with her
           fingernails.
                         
                          ERICA
           Open the door!!!
                         
           Erica violently pushes and pulls, jostling the piece of wood.
                         
           Nina concentrates, takes hold of the growth and yanks.
                         
           Blood vessels in her eyes explode, making the white turn red.
                         
           Nina looks at the object held in her fingers: a sharp, TINY
           BLACK SPINE. Like that of a sea urchin. Damp, feathery wisps
           hang off of it.
                         
           The door flings open.
                         
           Erica rushes in and finds Nina half-naked, her skin inflamed.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           Oh my god...
                         
           Nina starts forcing her out the door. Erica pushes back.
           85.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           Stop, you're sick!
                         
                          NINA
           Get OUT!
                         
           She manages to get her all the way out the door.
                         
           But ROTHBART'S HAND grabs the door frame.
                         
           Nina SLAMS the door, SMASHING the hand.
                         
           Erica SCREAMS in pain.
                         
           Nina slams the door again, and again. The hand now human.
                         
           She finally gets the door all the way shut.
                         
           She steps away from it, nervous...
                         
           She looks down, sees one of her knees SNAP backwards, like
           that of a bird. Then the other knee SNAPS back.
                         
           Nina stumbles and falls.
                         
           And SLAMS her head into the radiator.
                         
           SMASH TO BLACK.
                         
           TINNY MUSIC plays in the darkness.
                         
                          FADE IN:
                         
                         
          94 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - EVENING 94
                         
           Nina flutters open her eyes. The world comes into focus and
           she sees her mother hovering over her, stroking her hair.
                         
                          ERICA
           Sshh, shhh, it's okay. I'm here.
                         
           Nina looks around, disoriented. Sees her hands jammed inside
           thick socks, held on by rubber bands. Groggy, she tries to
           pull them off.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           You were scratching all night.
                         
           Erica helps remove the socks, her smashed hand wrapped in
           bandages.
                         
           Nina weakly tries to sit up, but Erica pushes her back down.
           86.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           Rest. Shhh, rest.
                         
          Nina gives in, too tired to fight her. Her eyes drift to the
          source of the tinny music: the open jewelry box. The
          ballerina's been broken off, all that remains is a single
          amputated leg, spinning morbidly on the base.
                         
           ERICA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           That's good. Rest.
                         
          Nina's eyes drift to the alarm clock. It's gone.
                         
                          NINA
           Where's the clock?
                         
                          ERICA
           Don't worry.
                         
          Nina looks at the dark window.
                         
                          NINA
           It's dark. What night is it?
                         
          Nina reads Erica's face. Reality clicks in.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
                          (PANICKING)
           What time is it?!
                         
          Nina tries to sit up, but her mother pushes her back down.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           I have to go.
                         
                          ERICA
           Don't worry. I called the theater
           and told them you weren't feeling
           well.
                         
          Nina freaks, struggles more violently.
                         
                          NINA
           No, I want to.
                         
                          ERICA
           Lie down!
                         
                          NINA
           Get off me!
                         
          Nina squirms free of Erica's grasp and gets out of bed. She
          gets to the door...
           87.
                         
          But the doorknob's been knocked-off, leaving just a metal
          post sticking out of the hole.
                         
                          ERICA
           We're staying in here until you
           feel better.
                         
          Nina grips the metal post and pulls and pulls, shaking the
          door.
                         
                          NINA
           Where is it?
                         
          Erica calmly sits down in her CHAIR, waiting for the storm to
          pass.
                         
                          ERICA
           This role is destroying you.
                         
          Nina rifles through her dresser drawers.
                         
          She notices her mother sitting calmly.
                         
                          NINA
           Move.
                         
                          ERICA
           Nina...
                         
          Nina grabs her by the wrist.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           Stop it.
                         
                          NINA
           You're crazy!
                         
                          ERICA
           What happened to my sweet girl?
                         
          Nina yanks Erica off the chair onto the floor.
                         
                          NINA
           She's gone.
                         
                          ERICA
           Please, you're not well.
                         
          Under the cushion Nina grabs the hidden brass DOORKNOB.
                         
          Erica lunges for her daughter's legs.
                         
                          NINA
           Let go!
           87A.
                         
                          ERICA
           You can't handle it!
                         
                          NINA
           I can't?! I'm the fucking swan
           queen! You never even got out of
           the corps.
                         
                          ERICA
           You fucking ungrateful-
                         
          Nina jams the knob onto the post, opens the door.
                         
           ERICA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           Don't leave! Nina!
           88.
                         
          95 EXT. THEATER - EVENING 95
                         
           Nina approaches the theater with harried steps.
                         
           Quickly past the row of SWAN LAKE posters.
                         
           She reaches the side of the building, flings open the stage
           door and enters.
                         
                         
          96 INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - EVENING 96
                         
           Nina frantically makes her way down the bustling hallway,
           chaotic with dancers. Excitement in the air.
                         
           She nears the soloists' dressing room.
                         
           Just outside of it, she spots a group of DANCERS excitedly
           chatting around a smiling Lily.
                         
           Nina stops in her tracks.
                         
           Lily glances in her direction, and her smile quickly fades
           into a sneer.
                         
                          LILY
           What are you doing here?
                         
           The other girls follow her gaze towards Nina, and their
           smiles turn to confusion.
                         
           LEROY (O.S.)
           Nina?
                         
           She turns and finds that Leroy has approached from behind
           her.
                         
                          LILY
           You're supposed to be sick.
                         
                          LEROY
           Lily, give us a minute.
                         
           Leroy pulls Nina towards her room. Lily glares at Nina as she
           passes.
                         
                         
          97 INT. PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM - SAME 97
                         
           Leroy closes the door behind them. He looks at Nina, wheels
           spinning.
           89.
                         
                          LEROY
           Are you okay?
                         
                          NINA
           I'm fine.
                         
          Nina goes to her wardrobe, finds her two costumes hanging.
          One for the White Swan, one for the Black Swan.
                         
                          LEROY
           Nina?
                         
          She doesn't heed him, pulls out the White Swan leotard and
          sets it on her chair.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Nina!
                         
                          NINA
           What?
                         
                          LEROY
           I already asked Lily-
                         
                          NINA
           Fuck. Have you announced it?
                         
          He hasn't.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           After Beth, do you need more
           controversy?
                         
          Leroy smirks at her directness.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           I'm here, Thomas. I'm doing it.
                         
          He looks at her, considering, and gives her a reluctant nod.
          She smiles.
           90.
                         
                          LEROY
           The only person standing in your
           way is you. It's time to let her
           go. Lose yourself.
                         
           She nods. He takes one last look at her and leaves. She
           breathes a sigh of relief.
                         
           Curious, she cracks open the door and peeks outside:
                         
                         
          98 INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY (NINA'S POV) 98
                         
           Leroy has pulled Lily down the corridor to break the news.
           Lily takes off, furious.

          100 INT. PRINCIPLE'S DRESSING ROOM - LATER 100
                         
           Through the PA, music from ACT 1 plays.
                         
           Nina sits at her vanity in a robe, wearing the full White
           Swan makeup and FEATHER CROWN. Pale, with red lipstick and
           dark eyeliner, she looks like a porcelain doll.
                         
           She drops the robe off her shoulder and covers her rash with
           white makeup.
                         
           The STAGE MANAGER'S voice comes through the PA speaker:
                         
           STAGE MANAGER (V.O.)
           Act 2's starting. Ten minutes.
                         
           She removes a slipper off one foot. Her big and second toe,
           and her pinky and fourth toe are stuck together. Puzzled, she
           peels them apart.
                         
           She removes her other slipper and finds the same toes
           completely FUSED, forming two large toes with double toenails
           on either side of the middle toe.
                         
           She touches the bird-like foot, concerned, but slips on her
           tights and hides the feet.
                         
                         
          101 INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT 101
                         
           Nina stretches nervously in the wings, awaiting her entrance.
                         
           She peeks out through a small hole in the wall, sees the
           AUDIENCE sitting expectantly in their seats.
                         
           The music begins and they shift and mummer in anticipation.
                         
           Nina pulls away, taking deep breaths and clenching her hands,
           trying to stay calm.
                         
           On stage, David enters, beginning the Act. He traverses the
           stage, "hunting" with a crossbow.
                         
                          STAGE MANAGER
                          (TO NINA)
           Go.
                         
           Nina takes a last breath and runs on.
                         
                         
                         102 STAGE 102
                         
           Under the spotlight, she begins dancing her intro.
           92.
                         
           David runs towards her and she startles away from him,
           afraid.
                         
           He grabs her and they begin their first Pas de Deux.
                         
                         
          103 INT. BACKSTAGE - LATER 103
                         
           Nina comes offstage, catching her breath. All around her,
           CORPS MEMBERS dressed as little swans rush back on stage,
           where FOUR LITTLE SWANS begin the Pas de Quatre.
                         
           Nina looks into the opposite wing and sees Leroy watching
           her. He gives her a small, contented nod, then disappears
           behind a swarm of dancers.
                         
           On stage, the Four Little Swans perform. In their identical
           makeup and costumes, they look disturbingly alike.
                         
           During the applause, Nina catches a glimpse of David
           backstage, sweaty, laughing and holding someone's hands. Nina
           can't see who, her view obscured by moving bodies and limbs.
                         
           Suspicious, Nina moves to get a better look.
                         
           Revealing that David's flirting with Lily.
                         
           Nina tenses.
                         
           Then the Four Little Swans rush offstage past Nina. She
           watches them go, unsettled.
                         
                          STAGE MANAGER
           What are you doing? You're on!
                         
           He gently nudges her, and she has to run back on.
                         
                         
                         104 STAGE 104
                         
           Nina rushes from the wings, directly into David's arms.
                         
           All the swans are frozen in two rows on each side of the
           stage, looking downstage.
                         
           David launches Nina into the air, hands around her waist.
           93.
                         
           He slowly turns her around, keeping her held high.
                         
           From her swirling, bird's eye view, Nina sees the rows of
           identically dressed Little Swans glaring at her...
                         
           Nina freaks, jerking her body.
                         
           David's grip SLIPS and Nina SLAMS onto the stage.
                         
           It's a horrific moment that feels like an eternity.
                         
           Gritting her teeth, Nina looks up around her, sees the faces
           of the other ballerinas. Staring at her sadistically.
                         
           Nina finds Lily, glancing at David. He snaps to and quickly
           helps Nina up.
                         
                          DAVID
           What the fuck?
                         
           She's too freaked to respond.
                         
           They resume dancing, Nina barely keeping it together.
                         
           Behind them, Rothbart appears and commands his flock to exit.
           The Little Swans start swirling off stage.
                         
           Leaving Nina and David alone.
                         
           David tries to pull her in one direction, but the dark hand
           of Rothbart summons her, transforming her back into a swan.
                         
           She pulls away from David, frantically flapping, until she
           disappears into the wings.
                         
                         
          105 INT. BACKSTAGE - SAME 105
                         
           As soon as she's off, she breaks down, hyperventilating. The
           dancer playing ROTHBART eyes her with concern.
                         
                          ROTHBART
           You alright?
                         
           She looks up, sees his creepy MASK, and backs away.
                         
           Rothbart has to go back on stage to finish the Act.
                         
           Other CORPS MEMBERS surround her, chirping "You okay?, "What
           happened?" etc.
                         
           Dazed, Nina doesn't answer. The music ends and there's a weak
           smattering of applause.
           94.
                         
                          STAGE MANAGER
           That's intermission! Act 3 in
           fifteen.
                         
           The other dancers scurry to get ready, abandoning her.
                         
           Nina sees Leroy on stage chewing David out, behind the closed
           curtain.
                         
           David spots Nina, glares at her, and sulks away.
                         
           Leroy runs his fingers through his hair, his back to Nina.
                         
           Nina cautiously approaches.
                         
                          NINA
           It wasn't my fault. He dropped me.
                         
           He can't even look at her.
                         
                          LEROY
                          (RAGING)
           What a fucking disaster!
                         
           He walks away.
                         
           All alone, Nina sees everyone backstage looking at her.
                         
           She runs, escaping their stares.

          107 INT. PRINCIPLE'S DRESSING ROOM - SAME 107
                         
           She closes the door behind her, ready to cry.
                         
           She looks up, and finds Lily putting on makeup and wearing
           the Black Swan costume.
                         
                          LILY
           Rough start, huh? Pretty
           humiliating...
           95.
                         
                          NINA
           Get out of here.
                         
                          LILY
           Wow...rude.
                         
          Lily coyly smiles, and continues applying makeup.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           I'm worried about the next act. Not
           sure you're feeling up to it.
                         
                          NINA
           Stop. Just stop.
                         
                          LILY
           How about...I dance the Black Swan
           for you?
                         
          Nina looks into the mirror. Instead of Lily's reflection
          there's the Double.
                         
                          NINA
           Leave me alone. Leave me alone.
                         
                          DOUBLE
                          (IN MIRROR)
           But it's my turn.
                         
          Nina's fury rises up from inside.
                         
                          NINA
           Leave me alone!!!
                         
          She charges...
                         
          And smashes her into the WALL LENGTH MIRROR, shattering it.
          Shards fall everywhere.
                         
          The Double flips Nina over and wails on her. Punch after
          punch.
                         
          Nina does her best to block the onslaught.
                         
          They scuffle, knocking things over, bumping into walls.
                         
          The Double gets her hands around Nina's neck...
                         
          Gasping for air, Nina tries to pull the hands free, but she's
          too strong.
           96.
                         
           Her hands frantically scramble along the surface of the
           floor. The fingers barely touch the edge of a MIRROR SHARD,
           but can't grasp it.
                         
           The Double squeezes down.
                         
           The blood vessels in Nina's eyes BURST again. Her neck starts
           to stretch unnaturally. Strength surges through her body and
           she lunges...
                         
           Finally grabbing the SHARD.
                         
           And DRIVES it into the Double's stomach.
                         
           Nina glances at her hand, cut by the mirror, then back up.
                         
           The Double is now LILY. Stunned, Lily looks down and touches
           the stab wound.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           It's my turn.
                         
           Lily coughs up blood and collapses, dead.
                         
           Nina stares at her, breathing heavily, high on adrenaline.
                         
           A KNOCK on the door.

           Nina drags the stiffening body into the wardrobe closet.

           Nina zips up the back to the Black Swan costume.
                         
           She deliberately applies the Black Swan makeup. Dark eye
           shadow and rouge, maroon lipstick.
                         
           Dressed in black and wearing the dark make-up of the Black
           Swan, she looks fierce.
                         
           She stares at her reflection, her eyes burning RED. New
           rash bumps pop up on her arms, the intensity building within.

          111A INT. STAGE - NIGHT 111A
                         
           Nina bursts onto stage as the Black Swan, accompanied by
           Rothbart.
                         
           She looks powerful, intense as she moves towards David.
                         
           His face shows his surprise.
                         
           Nina dances the first Pas de Deux with him. They finish and
                          EXIT

                          WOW-
                         
           She walks away from him.
                         
           Alone, she looks at her arms, sees black points trying to
           push through again.
                         
           Some fully emerge as shiny BLACK FEATHERS.
                         
           She just watches them, not panicking, but accepting the
           transformation taking place. Even beckoning it.
                         
           Her second entrance cue is played.
                         
                          STAGE MANAGER
           That's you!
                         
           She leaps back on
                         
                         
          111C STAGE 111C
                         
           For the Coda. She takes a brief pause, closing her eyes once
           more, and then completely lets herself go.
                         
           She spins with ferocity. More BLACK FEATHERS burst out from
           her shoulders and back.
                         
           At last, she truly embodies the Black Swan.
           98.
                         
           She finishes the Coda, punctuating her last spin with a sharp
           step that echoes through the theater.
                         
           The audience looks on, mesmerized. Too stunned to clap at
           first.
                         
          111D Nina looks down at the stage, her face glazed with sweat 111D
                         
           She has returned to normal. No feathers. Normal eyes. A
           woman.
                         
           She finally looks up at the audience, and they ERUPT in a
           standing ovation.
                         
           Nina walks to the front of the stage, takes her bow.
                         
           Nina looks up at the MASS OF BODIES filling the auditorium,
           vibrating with applause.
                         
           Proud, Nina smiles and bows again. Again and again.
                         
           She finally runs off stage, the applause still going strong.
                         
                         
          112 INT. BACKSTAGE - SAME 112
                         
           Nina enters the wings, other dancers cheer loudly. Even
           Veronica and Galina.
                         
           She pushes past all the smiling faces. It feels very
           surreal.
                         
           She sees Leroy clapping and shaking his head. Blown away.
                         
                          LEROY
           Get back out there! Get back-
                         
           She stops his mouth with a kiss. The kind of kiss that you
           can't stop. Not desperate, but adamant.
                         
           Finally she disengages, staring at him in the eyes, but
           before he can say anything...
                         
           She turns and rushes back on stage. He's stunned. Like he's
           been run over by a truck.
                         
                         
          113 INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - LATER 113
                         
           She walks towards her dressing room, a satisfied smile on her
           face.
                         
           She passes the stage manager.
           99.
                         
                          STAGE MANAGER
           Great job. You got fifteen til the
           last act.
                         
           She nods and arrives at her room.
                         
           She opens the door, makes sure no ones looking, and enters
           quickly.
                         
                         
          114 INT. PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM - SAME 114
                         
           She closes the door behind her, locks it. Turns and sees the
           broken glass all over the floor.
                         
           She eyes the closed wardrobe. A pool of blood drips out from
           under the door.
                         
           She picks up a towel and lays it over the blood.
                         
           She starts to undress.
                         
                         
          115 INT. PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 115
                         
           Back in the White Swan costume, she re-applies the makeup.
                         
           There's a KNOCK on the door. She looks towards it, her face
           only halfway made-up.
                         
                          NINA
           One second.
                         
           She goes to the door, opens it just a crack.
                         
           She peeks through and finds...
                         
           LILY looking back at her.
                         
                          LILY
           Hey...you were amazing.
                         
           Nina's petrified.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Seriously. I'm sorry things got so
           messed up between us. Just, holy
           shit, totally blown away...
           100.
                         
          Nina barely manages a nod.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Anyway, wanted to tell you. I'll
           let you finish. Merde.
                         
          Lily turns and walks away.
                         
          Nina swiftly shuts the door.
                         
          She turns around, stares at the wardrobe.
                         
          She steps cautiously towards it, her face repeated
          countlessly in all the reflective shards.
                         
          She lifts the towel from the ground and looks at it.
                         
          It is clean. No blood. She looks down at the floor. No blood
          there either.
                         
          She slowly opens the door to the wardrobe...
                         
          And finds it empty. No body whatsoever.
                         
          She looks over at the broken mirror. Sees her reflection
          staring back at her.
                         
          She stares at it for a long beat, and realizes something.
                         
          She touches her stomach and winces a little. Pulls back her
          hand. It's coated with red liquid. Blood.
                         
          It's started to soak through the costume, creating a faint
          red spot. The fabric is ripped at the center of the stain.
                         
          She feels inside for confirmation.
                         
          And discovers a stab wound, in her own stomach.
                         
          She pulls out the sharp tip of mirror still stuck inside.
          Blood begins flowing more rapidly.
                         
          She drops the mirror.
                         
           STAGE MANAGER (V.O.)
           (On the PA)
           White Swan in 5.
                         
          In a daze, she sits down at the vanity, and finishes applying
          the rest of the White Swan's makeup.
           101.
                         
          116A INT. STAGE - LATER 116A
                         
           Nina dances the final Pas de Deux as the White Swan. Losing
           blood by the second, everything is woozy and blurry.
                         
           She can't do all the steps, but her performance is pained,
           making it poignant.
                         
           A spot of red begins to soak through at the center of her
           costume.
                         
           The music turns ominous, and VON ROTHBART, the evil sorcerer,
           comes onto stage.
                         
           Nina dances away from him, back upstage, towards the cliff.
           It's time for her final leap.
                         
           Her energy fading, she teeters up the stairs of the set. One
           step at a time...
                         
           She gets to the top, takes one last look around, at all the
           eyes watching her.
                         
           She notices a familiar face in the audience: HER MOTHER. She
           watches with a profound sadness, tears streaking her cheeks.
                         
           In the front of Nina's costume, a dark circle has started to
           form. Her blood fully seeping through.
                         
           And Nina leaps...
                         
          116B INTO BLACKNESS 116B
                         
           She falls through an endless void, her eyes closed.
                         
           She slowly twists around in the air, so that she's falling
           backwards.
                         
           She hears something. Soft and muffled.
                         
           The faint sound of applause.
                         
          116C She lands slowly and comfortably on PADDING. 116C
                         
           The sound of applause is now loud, uproarious.
                         
           A group of BALLERINAS surround the mattress, clapping for
           her, each one dressed as a WHITE SWAN.
                         
           Leroy pushes through the group to get to her.
                         
                          LEROY
           Listen to them! They love you! Get
           up, get up!

           102.
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           I always knew you had it in you,
           little princess. Go take your bow!
                         
          Nina is too weak to move.
                         
          Lily pushes her way into the group and GASPS, pointing at
          Nina's abdomen.
                         
          Leroy follows her gaze and discovers the spot of blood, which
          has grown in size.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           What did you do?
                         
                          NINA
           I felt it.
                         
                          LEROY
           Oh my god.
                         
                          NINA
           ...perfect.
                         
                          LEROY
           Someone, get help.
                         
                          NINA
           Shhh...
                         
          Leroy looks back at her. She smiles.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           It was perfect.
                         
          He understands.
                         
          The APPLAUSE grows more and more faint. Her eyes glaze over
          and everything goes completely SILENT.
                         
          Nina lies there motionless, a smile frozen on her face.
                         
          CUT TO BLACK.
