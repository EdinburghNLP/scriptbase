                   Written by

<b>INT. MASTER BATHROOM - DAY
</b>
PETE (39) and DEBBIE (39) are having fantastic sex in the
shower. Debbie moans loudly. Pete is strong and sure of
himself. In total control.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Oh Pete! Oh my god! This is crazy!

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Oh my god. So incredible. Want to
          know a secret? I took a Viagra.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          What?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          I took a Viagra. Those things
          totally work. This is awesome. Why
          don't I use this every day?

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          What? What did you do? Wait. Stop.

Debbie gets out of the shower. Pete follows.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          What's the matter?

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          You just took a Viagra to have sex
          with me?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          I thought it would make it better.
          It was better. It takes some of the
          pressure off.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Because you can't get hard without
          a Viagra? Is it because you don't
          think I'm sexy?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          I thought you'd think it was fun
          for me to supersize it for once.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          That is the worst birthday present
          you could ever give someone.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          I was just trying to go turbo for
          your birthday.
<b>                    (MORE)
</b><b>                                                           2.
</b>
<b>                    PETE (CONT'D)
</b>          My hard-ons are still in analog.
          This shit's digital.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          I don't want a turbo penis. I like
          your medium soft one.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Look, I can get it up. Just not
          that far up.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Where did you get this?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          I got it from Barry.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          What? You got it from Barry?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Why do you care? This is my dick
          we're talking about, not yours.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          We are young people. We don't need
          medication to have sex.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          I only took it because it's your
          birthday. I thought you'd like it.
          Happy fucking fortieth birthday.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          I am not forty! And I don't want to
          have a husband who has to take
          Viagra to get a hard-on.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          I don't have to take it every time,
          but once in a while...

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Fuck forty! Forty can suck my dick.


<b>TITLE UP - THIS IS 40
</b>

<b>INT. HALLWAY/SADIE'S ROOM - MORNING
</b>
Pete sneaks down the hallway. He kisses SADIE (13) as he
wakes her. She wants to be left alone.
<b>                                                            3.
</b>

<b>                    SADIE
</b>          Your breath smells weird.

Pete breathes all over her as he talks.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Wake up, wake up. Time to get up.


<b>INT. CHARLOTTE'S ROOM - MORNING
</b>
Pete lifts a sleeping CHARLOTTE (8) out of bed and walks her
downstairs. It looks ridiculous because she is too tall to
hold her like she is a baby.


<b>INT. BREAKFAST NOOK - MORNING
</b>
Pete and the kids set up a tray of muffins and donuts on the
table and decorate the room with birthday balloons,
streamers, etc. Pete sneaks bacon, cupcakes, and mini donuts
into his mouth occasionally. The house is a bit more
cluttered and messier than when we last saw it in Knocked Up.


<b>INT. MASTER BATHROOM - MORNING
</b>
Debbie opens a window and sneaks a cigarette.

<b>                    PETE (O.C.)
</b>          We're ready!

She holds her cigarette with a yellow dish washing glove. She
puts out the cigarette and goes through an elaborate routine
of hiding the smell of smoke. She puts some weird oil in her
hair and uses a wet nap on her neck and clothes and brushes
her teeth. She sprays cologne and walks through it.


<b>INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
</b>
Pete and the kids hold a cake and sing "Happy Birthday" as
Debbie walks in. When they are done she blows out the candles
on the cake which says "Happy 38th Birthday."

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Make a wish!


<b>INT. KITCHEN, TV AREA - MORNING
</b>
The kids eat cereal. Sadie watches Lost on her iPad while
Pete and Debbie talk in the kitchen.
<b>                                                4.
</b>

<b>                    CHARLOTTE
</b>          Can I watch Lost?

<b>                    SADIE
</b>          You can't handle Lost. It's too
          violent, and you won't understand.

<b>                    CHARLOTTE
</b>          If I don't understand it, why can't
          I handle it?

<b>                    SADIE
</b>          Because you're eight.

<b>                    CHARLOTTE
</b>          I can handle it. I've seen a shark
          eat a guy on Shark Week.

<b>                    SADIE
</b>          Shark Week is fake.

<b>                    CHARLOTTE
</b>          No, it's not.

<b>                    SADIE
</b>          All of it is reenactments.

<b>                    CHARLOTTE
</b>          I know but they--

<b>                    SADIE
</b>          That's scary! You shouldn't be
          allowed to watch that.

<b>                    CHARLOTTE
</b>          --they show the reenactments but
          they actually happened.

<b>                    SADIE
</b>          It's going to give you nightmares.

<b>                    CHARLOTTE
</b>          I can handle a nightmare. You're a
          nightmare every day for me.


<b>INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
</b>
Pete clears the breakfast dishes.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Hey. Don't eat that cupcake.
<b>                                                         5.
</b>

<b>                      PETE
</b>          What?

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          The one you just put into the sink.
          I saw you were hiding that.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          This cupcake? You think I'm going
          to eat this cupcake?

<b>                      DEBBIE
</b>          Yeah.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          I so don't want this cupcake. Look.

He turns on the faucet and pours water on the cupcake.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          You're still going to eat it.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          I'm going to eat this cupcake?

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Just put it in the trash.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          What would you like to do today?
          Your choice.

<b>                      DEBBIE
</b>          Anything?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Yeah, anything.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Just hang out with you guys.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Don't you want to get a massage? Or
          do something fun? Forty's huge.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          I'm turning thirty-eight.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Okay. Thirty-eight. We'll move on.
          Isn't it weird that our birthday is
          the same week and that we're going
          to have a party, and it's just for
          me?
<b>                                                         6.
</b>

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          No. I don't think it's weird at
          all. Because you're turning forty
          and I'm turning thirty-eight.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Come on. Do you really want to be
          one of those ladies who's just so
          insecure about their age and they
          lie and then they've got to
          remember.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          You don't get it. You don't
          understand how it works. I don't
          want to shop at old lady stores. I
          don't want to go to J. Jill and
          Chicos and Ann Taylor Loft. I'm not
          ready yet. I need two more years.

<b>                    PETE

          birthday?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          I thought you said that we
          shouldn't get each other gifts this
          year?

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          What do you mean? You're supposed
          to get me a surprise gift. This is
          a big birthday. I'm turning forty!

<b>INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

Debbie is in workout gear. Pete enters wearing a lycra outfit
with all sorts of logos on it. He is a complete bicycling
asshole.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          I am going to work out. I'll be
          back in about an hour.

          you a happy birthday?

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          No. That's no surprise.

Debbie leaves. Pete picks the soaking wet cupcake out of the
sink and takes a bite.

Debbie runs up a long flight of stairs with her trainer
JASON. Her friend BARB trails behind.

</b>          Come on.

<b>                     BARB

<b>                    JASON
</b>          You've got to keep up with us,

          looks like your body and her body
          looks like her body. Before, after.
          Before, after.

<b>                    BARB
</b>          You guys just go on without me. I'm

We see Pete in a large group of bikers riding down San

<b>                    PETE
</b>          It's not really a team, it's just a

          ride.

<b>                    BARRY
</b>          I know, I know.

A car makes a right turn in front of Pete, nearly hitting
him. Pete bangs on the back of the car.

Debbie is doing sit-ups while talking to Jason, who holds her
feet down. In the background, Barb stretches on a yoga ball.

<b>                    JASON
</b>          So why on earth is Pete taking
          Viagra? What's going on?

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          I don't know. I think maybe he just
          isn't attracted to me anymore.

<b>                    JASON
</b>          That is ridiculous. If you were my
          girlfriend, I would not need a
          Viagra. I would need an anti-Viagra
          pill. To try not to get a boner.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          But everyone gives you a boner.

<b>                    JASON
</b>          Don't sell yourself short like
          that. You give me a boner.
              (whispers)
          Barb doesn't give me a boner.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Maybe things are just getting
          stale. That's why maybe I work out
          really hard. Maybe he'll be able to
          get a boner again.

<b>                    BARB

I have no sex, and I am the

<b>          JASON
</b>I knew it. I knew you were not
having sex. I can see it on your

<b>          BARB
</b>I'm enjoying our non-sex period,

<b>          JASON
</b>Don't you miss it?

<b>          BARB
</b>Well, I wouldn't know, because I
don't have any feeling down there
anymore. I have nerve damage from
my C-section so everything is just
kinda-

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>She's numb down there.

<b>          BARB
</b>I could sit down hard on a fire
hydrant, and I wouldn't even know
that I was sitting. I could get
stung by a hornet down there, and I
would not feel it. You could put
anything in there, and I would not
know what the object was. I used to
pee in a nice stream, and now it
just kind of goes like a shower
head.

<b>          JASON
</b>That is the saddest thing I've ever
heard.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>I think you need a family. Don't
you want a family?

<b>          JASON
</b>No, I think I want to Clooney it.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>Clooney it?
<b>                                               10.

<b>                      JASON
</b>          Yup.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          He doesn't seem happy.

<b>                    JASON
</b>          Yeah, he is.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          No. He's lonely.

<b>                    JASON
</b>          No, he's not.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          See, I think he has sad eyes.

<b>                    JASON
</b>          Aw, you sweet little thing. He's
          doing sad, lonely eyes. To get the
          next lady. I can do it too, watch.

Jason demonstrates.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          I bet George Clooney is really
          lonely. Just him and his pig.

<b>                    JASON
</b>          You'd fuck him.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          I wouldn't.

<b>                    JASON
</b>          So would you.

<b>                    BARB
</b>          I would. I wouldn't feel it but-

<b>                    JASON
</b>          You'd fuck him with your numb
          vagina. Yes, you would. Ocean's
          thirteen inches, that's what you'd
          find out.

Pete and Barry eat frosted scones, happy to get some alone
time to delay their return home.

<b>                    BARRY
</b>          I mean that was idiotic. You have
          to understand. That's like the one
          thing you don't do is tell her you
          used Viagra. I think that's even on
          the warning label.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          We're in one of those phases where
          everything the other person says
          just annoys the shit out of each
          other. All the time. It's a blast.

<b>                    BARRY
</b>          Don't worry about it. You just
          gotta ride that out.

<b>                     PETE
</b>          This sounds terrible but do you
          ever wonder what it would be like
          if, say, you were separated by
          something bigger, like death. Like
          her death?

<b>                    BARRY
</b>          I have given it a fair amount of
          thought.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Not in a painful way. Just quietly
          slid into death. Like a gas leak.

<b>                    BARRY
</b>          Absolutely. It has got to be
          peaceful. I mean this is the mother
          of your children.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          I'd want it to be a peaceful --
          just like, drift, into a coma, from
          which she never awakens.

<b>                    BARRY
</b>          Then you move on. Then you're a
          widower.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          That's just it. People love
          widowers.

          polar opposite of divorced guys.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          It's the best.

<b>                    BARRY
</b>          It's like, oh, that poor widower.
          You know. If I could only--

<b>INT. CAR - DAY

iPad. The Pixies play on the stereo, and Pete sings along.

          this song about a Salvador Dali

<b>                    PETE
</b>          This song kicks off Doolittle, one
          of the best albums of the last
          thirty years. An important record.

<b>                    SADIE

</b>          Are you kidding me? You can't watch

          brain.

<b>                    SADIE
</b>          It's not melting my brain, it's
          blowing my mind.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          That's really bad, Sadie. You're

<b>                    SADIE
</b>          My relationship with Lost is not

          to go to the store.

<b>                    DESI
</b>          Jodi? Oh, Jodi's my new BFF. She's
          like a little kitty cat. Sometimes

</b>          It's because she's stupid. I think

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          She's not stealing. She's our best

</b>          Well, how much did I make?

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          You brought in twenty-two hundred.

<b>                    JODI
</b>          That's not bad.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Well, that's not that good. I mean,

</b>          Maybe she's wearing dark underwear.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Yeah. Maybe she has underwear that
          has a picture of a vagina painted
          on it.

</b>          Maybe some deep oranges and browns

feet. Pete is nowhere to be found.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          We're all downstairs waiting for
          you. You've been up here for a
          really long time now.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Oh, I'm almost done. I'll be down
          in a second.
<b>                                      17.
</b>

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>Charlotte just did her first flip
on the trampoline, and she landed
on her feet. She was really proud
of herself.

<b>          PETE
</b>Oh, that's great.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>And you missed it.

<b>          PETE
</b>She'll do it again.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>It's just that this is the fourth
time you've gone to the bathroom
today.

<b>          PETE
</b>Give me a break.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>Why is your instinct to escape?

<b>          PETE
</b>It's not my instinct to escape from
you. It is my instinct to come into
the bathroom when I need to go to
the bathroom.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>How come I don't smell anything?

<b>          PETE
</b>It's because I shoved an Altoid up
my ass before I came in here.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>Let me see then.

<b>          PETE
</b>What?

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>Let me see!

<b>          PETE
</b>No, I'm not going to let you see.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>You're not going to let me see
because you're not taking a poop.

</b>          I've been flushing as I go.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          You're flushing as you go? Who
          takes a half hour to go to the

<b>                    PETE

          John Goodman.

She angrily grabs his iPad and walks out.

<b>                    PETE (CONT'D)
</b>          Don't press Enter! I'm not sure I
          want to make that move!


<b>EXT. SMALL NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
</b>
A sign outside reads: "Tonight Only: Graham Parker"


<b>INT. SMALL NIGHTCLUB - STAGE - NIGHT
</b>
Pete stands on stage speaking to a small crowd.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          You know, when I started this
          label, my dream was to work with
          musicians and bands whose music I
          just admired so much. The person
          that I thought, "My god, wouldn't
          it be incredible to work with" was
          Graham Parker. Tonight we have him.
          Solo. Because we couldn't afford to
          fly in The Rumour.

The crowd applauds as Graham Parker (60's) leaps on stage.

Pete and Debbie watch Graham sing a very moving song. The
song is fantastic and personal, but clearly not commercial.

We watch Debbie. Although the music is great, it's a little
depressing and not working on her. She quickly gets bored.


<b>INT. CAR - NIGHT
</b>
Pete and Debbie are driving home.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          It's just not my kind of music.
<b>                                                        19.
</b>

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Really. What is your kind of music?

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          I like Lady Gaga.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Oh, god, of course you do.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          What?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Shallow dance music.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          It's not! It's fun, and it's about
          release and sex and power.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          You know, you don't have to like
          it. It's really not for you, that's
          fine.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          This is a job. This is not a hobby.
          Can't you love him just as a hobby?
          And sign a fifteen-year-old hot
          girl so we can eat?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Graham Parker and The Rumour had
          two albums in the Rolling Stone Top
          500 Best Albums of All Time. Two of
          `em. If I can just sell ten
          thousand records to his hardcore
          fan base, we're golden.

An ambulance drives by, sirens blaring.

<b>                     DEBBIE
</b>              (pause, then laughing)
          The last of Graham Parker's fans
          just died.


<b>INT. SADIE'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Pete and Debbie walk in mid-argument. Sadie is listening to a
song on her iPhone.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Sadie. Sadie, what are you
          listening to?
<b>                    (MORE)
</b><b>                                                        20.

<b>                    DEBBIE (CONT'D)
</b>          Okay, this is music that makes
          people happy. And this is what
          people buy. Right, girls?

She puts Sadie's iPod in a dock and plays the Nikki Minaj rap
"Roman's Revenge." They all start rapping along to it.

They all laugh and dance and go crazy. Pete turns the iPod
off.

<b>                    DEBBIE (CONT'D)
</b>          Why did you take it off?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Now, something that really rocks.

Pete puts on "Rooster" by Alice In Chains.

<b>                    PETE (CONT'D)
</b>          This is called good music. From
          somebody's heart.

<b>                    SADIE
</b>          This is bumming me out. This isn't
          fun.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Just listen to these words, okay?

<b>                    CHARLOTTE
</b>          I don't understand the words.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          This is lyrics, this is poetry.
          This is what is going to survive in
          a hundred years.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          It just doesn't make people happy.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          It makes me happy. I can dance to
          it.

Pete starts dancing around like it is fun.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          You're the only one in the room
          who's happy.

Pete stops his music.
<b>                                                        21.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Sometimes, I wish just one of you
          had a dick.

<b>                    CHARLOTTE
</b>          Well, we don't want one.


<b>INT. HOUSE - MORNING

Pete sits with the kids and eats breakfast. Debbie scurries
around him to prep the kids for school.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>              (to Pete)
          Is there something that you can do
          to be helping me right now?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Yeah, I'm ready to help. Just tell
          me what to do.

<b>                     DEBBIE
</b>          Can you go get a lunch box or
          something?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          For me or for them?

Charlotte runs away towards her room. Sadie screams.

<b>                    SADIE
</b>          Charlotte! I've got a test!

<b>                    CHARLOTTE

<b>                    SADIE
</b>          Charlotte, I'm going to kill you!

Debbie covers Sadie's mouth.

<b>                       DEBBIE
</b>          Shhh!

<b>EXT. SCHOOL - MORNING
</b>
Debbie runs Charlotte into the school. Along the way they see
a lot of parents. Debbie says "Hi" to them in the way that
lets us know that she does not know anybody's name. Debbie
says "Hello" to a PREGNANT FIFTY-YEAR-OLD PARENT, towing a
seven-year-old boy.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Hi, any day now, huh?

<b>                    PREGNANT FIFTY-YEAR-OLD PARENT
</b>          Not really. Three more months!

Another parent, BETH, and her adorable child walk over.

<b>                    BETH
</b>          Katie's dying for a play date.
          Let's hook these two up.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          That would be great, I'll call you.

Beth and Katie walk off.

<b>                       CHARLOTTE
</b>          No.

<b>                       DEBBIE
</b>          "No" what?

<b>                       CHARLOTTE
</b>          No.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          What? She's sweet.

<b>                    CHARLOTTE
</b>          She's evil.


<b>INT./EXT. CHARLOTTE'S SCHOOL - MORNING

As they walk into class, the teacher pulls Debbie aside.

<b>                    TEACHER
</b>          Hi. Listen, Charlotte really needs
          to get here on time because she
          needs the extra time to just settle
          in.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Oh. We are on time.
<b>                                                           23.

<b>                    TEACHER
</b>          Being on time means being early.

<b>                       DEBBIE
</b>          Oh. Okay.

<b>                    TEACHER
</b>          Well, it's nice to see you in

          you.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          I come to--

The teacher walks away before Debbie can defend herself.

<b>                       GRANDMA MOLLY
</b>          Hi Debbie!

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Hi, Grandma Molly.

<b>                    GRANDMA MOLLY
</b>          How are you? I'm so happy about the
          science fair. It's going very well
          I heard. I love you. You look so
          beautiful. Happy birthday! I just
          learned it's your fortieth. Are you
          forty?

<b>                       DEBBIE
</b>          Yeah.

<b>                    GRANDMA MOLLY
</b>          I remember when I was forty, and
          then I blinked and there I was,
          going to be ninety. My god, where
          did it go? One day you're going to
          blink, and you're going to be
          ninety, and I won't be around to
          see it. And that makes me very sad.
          I'm telling you, I'm warning you.

Pete is with RONNIE and CAT, employees at his record label.
They are watching an electronic press kit cut together for
Graham Parker. There is a montage of him performing
throughout the years from the seventies to the present.

<b>                    RONNIE
</b>          What are you doing?

<b>                    CAT
</b>          I'm contextualizing him as one of
          the great figures in rock history.
<b>                                      25.
</b>

<b>          RONNIE
</b>You can't show him in his prime in
`77 and then jump straight to him
as he is now. It's terrifying. You
have to reverse it. You've got to
show him as he is now very briefly,
and then show him in 1977. You have
to "Benjamin Button" it.

<b>          CAT
</b>I don't know what you're talking
about, okay? All rock stars are
older now. Steven Tyler, David
Bowie, Mick Jagger--

<b>          PETE
</b>Paul McCartney.

<b>          RONNIE
</b>Okay, stop it. Everybody you're
mentioning looks like an old woman
now. You're just mentioning a bunch
of Jessica Tandys. Keith Richards
gets away with it. But that's
because Keith Richards looked
seventy when he was forty, and now
that he's seventy, he looks sixty-
nine. He's regenerating.

<b>          CAT
</b>I like it. And I think Graham
Parker is sexy.

<b>          RONNIE
</b>Would you fuck him?

<b>          CAT
</b>Yes.

<b>          RONNIE
</b>You'd fuck him, and you won't fuck
me?

<b>          CAT
</b>I mean, I kind of fucked you once,
if you could have finished.

<b>          RONNIE
</b>Oh, I finished.

<b>          PETE
</b>You know what, enough of who fucked
who and who finished what.

<b>                    RONNIE
</b>          I finished.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Look. It's a retro label. That's
          our niche. That's our market. It
          costs money to break new bands, I
          can't do that.

<b>                    RONNIE
</b>          Oh, okay. And also you're the guy
          who turned down Arcade Fire.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Everyone turned down Arcade Fire.

<b>                    CAT
</b>          It's crazy, there are so many of
          them!

<b>                    PETE
</b>          We don't have the money to market a
          new band. We just need to make
          Graham seem relevant. Who is he
          talking to?

<b>                    CAT
</b>          Um, the Jewish Journal.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          The Jewish Journal?

<b>                    RONNIE
</b>          Apparently old Jews are the only
          ones who still buy hard copies of
          records. Because they don't like to
          download music. Because they don't
          know what downloading means.

Angle on Graham and a journalist wearing a yarmulke.

<b>                    INTERVIEWER

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Why?

<b>                    CAT
</b>          I don't think he's being ironic, I
          think he just really likes Oreos.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Look. The Paul Westerberg record
          did okay. Frank Black did all
          right. The Haircut 100, not so
          much. We have to break this record.
          Otherwise, we're not here next
          year.

<b>                    RONNIE
</b>          He's coming. Oreo man is coming.

Graham walks up.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Hey guys, how are you?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Gout?

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Yeah, my whole family, they all had
          gout.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Jesus.

<b>                    RONNIE
</b>          That's very unfortunate.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          My auntie Queenie, she had a foot
          like the size of a small pig. I've
          got a photo of it.

<b>                     RONNIE
</b>          I'd love to see that photo of that
          gout foot.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          A couple of bunions as well.

<b>                      RONNIE
</b>          Fuck.

<b>                     GRAHAM
</b>          I've got to go to the podiatrist,

          something.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Yeah, well, let's get you to the

<b>                    CAT
</b>          Bye, Graham.

<b>INT. PETE'S HOME OFFICE - AFTERNOON
</b>
Pete and Debbie are talking. Debbie holds a list of changes
she wants to make.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          The happiest period in people's
          lives is from age forty to sixty.
          So this is it. We're in it, right
          now.

<b>                      PETE
</b>          Says who?

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Says a lot of people, most people.

<b>                      PETE
</b>          Huh.
<b>                                      29.
</b>

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>We have everything we need right
now to be completely happy. We're
going to blink and be ninety.

<b>          PETE
</b>What?

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>So, let's just choose to be happy.

<b>          PETE
</b>Yeah.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>Your eyes are kind of glazing over.

<b>          PETE
</b>No, I'm just processing it all.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>Some of these I wrote for you. So,
we have to exercise every day.
Spend more time alone together. We
have to go to the therapist every
week.

<b>          PETE
</b>That's a little pricey.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>No stressing over tiny things.

<b>          PETE
</b>Yeah, that's good. You should do
that.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>We have to get more involved in
school. Have more patience with the
kids. And we need to work on our
anger.

<b>          PETE
</b>Yeah, I think it would be good if
you could take care of your anger.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>No, I said both of us.

<b>          PETE
</b>That's what I said. Our anger.
<b>                                      30.
</b>

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>Okay. No more smoking.

<b>          PETE
</b>Yeah, you've got to cut that out.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>I don't want to make this about a
fight, I want to just be positive.

<b>          PETE
</b>Sorry.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>Okay, and then no more holding on
to resentments. We have to just let
that go.

<b>          PETE
</b>So, you're saying that if we're
arguing and I apologize, you'll let
it go and not throw it back in my
face later?

<b>           DEBBIE
</b>Well, I don't do that, but I will
continue not to do that. What did
you write?

<b>          PETE
</b>All of that. That's plenty. That's
a lot.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>And you're going to eat better?

<b>          PETE
</b>Oh, yeah. I've been doing a decent
job, but I don't think there's
anything wrong with having some
fries every now and again.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>And then I'll smoke that day.

<b>          PETE
</b>That's not the same thing.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>It is the same thing.

<b>          PETE
</b>I like fries.
<b>                                                        31.
</b>

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          And the other thing is your dad
          stuff.

Pete picks up a guitar and starts playing with it.

<b>                    DEBBIE (CONT'D)
</b>          The not letting him guilt trip you
          all the time, because that puts a
          lot of pressure on you, and the
          whole family feels it. He's a grown
          man, and he's not our
          responsibility. And you're not
          giving him money anymore, right?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          No, I haven't been giving him money
          for years, I told you.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Can you please put that down?


<b>INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Pete and Debbie are in bed. Debbie has a computer on her lap.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          A lot of people are RSVP-ing to
          your birthday party.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          You sure you don't want to just do
          a joint birthday party?

<b>                       DEBBIE
</b>          No.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          We always used to.

<b>                       DEBBIE
</b>          No.

We reveal that Debbie is watching security cam footage of the
store.

<b>                    DEBBIE (CONT'D)
</b>          Did Jodi tell you she thinks Desi's
          stealing?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Are you serious?
<b>                                                        32.
</b>

<b>                      DEBBIE
</b>          Yes.

<b>                      PETE
</b>          How much?

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Twelve thousand dollars.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Oh, god. And Desi's taking it?

<b>                     DEBBIE
</b>          Well, I don't know. That's what
          Jodi said.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          We really need the store to work.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          It is. Don't put that kind of
          pressure on me.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          That's not what I mean.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Are you nervous about money? Are we
          okay?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Yeah. Maybe we just suck it up
          because she's clearly earning so
          much more than any other employee
          we have.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Oh, yeah. For sure. We can't fire
          her. We're barely breaking even
          with her.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          That's why we have to keep her.

We watch the footage and suddenly Desi's BOYFRIEND enters. He
walks behind the counter, and she sits on his lap. She
adjusts herself.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Look at this, she's making out with
          somebody.

On the screen, they kiss. Desi seems to be popping up and
down a little.
<b>                                                33.
</b>

<b>                    DEBBIE (CONT'D)
</b>          Is she screwing him??

<b>                    PETE
</b>          That might be like a dry hump.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Look at the position of her skirt.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          That's too grainy to know for sure.
          Oh my god, this is the middle of
          the day. Customers could be in
          there.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          At least she's getting some.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          What did you say? "At least she's
          getting some"?

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Yes.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          What are you talking about? We had
          sex the other night. You have to
          give me a little credit for that.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          It's not about credit. We need to
          have more passion. Like this.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          That's not passion.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          It looks like passion to me.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          What--

Pete farts.

<b>                    PETE (CONT'D)
</b>          What is she doing?

He farts again. It is longer.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Oh my god. Don't do that!

Debbie hits Pete with a pillow.
<b>                                                        34.
</b>

<b>                    PETE
</b>          What am I doing?

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Don't fart in the bed!

<b>                    PETE
</b>          I'm not, it's the springs.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          This is why we never have sex.
          That's disgusting. You're gross.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          I don't know what you're talking
          about.

Pete farts again.


<b>INT. SADIE'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Charlotte jumps around in front of Sadie's door. Sadie sits
on her bed quietly doing homework.

<b>                    CHARLOTTE
</b>              (singing)
          Sadie. Sadie, Sadie! Sadie, Sadie!

<b>                    SADIE
</b>          Charlotte. I'm doing my homework.

<b>                    CHARLOTTE
</b>          Okay, watch this. There's a haunted
          cow back here, and I'm pretty sure
          it does not have milk!

Charlotte grabs her own head and makes it look like she's
being dragged away.

<b>                    CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
</b>          Did you see that? They took me
          away!

Sadie does not even look up.

<b>                    CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
</b>          You're no fun. You never want to
          play.

Charlotte plays air guitar. Sadie does not respond.

<b>                    CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
</b>          You're so mean since your body got
          weird.

<b>                    SADIE
</b>          Close the door.


<b>EXT. HOUSE - MORNING
</b>
Debbie and Pete begin their "fresh start." Debbie tosses her
cigarettes in the garbage cans outside. Pete tosses a packet
of M&amp;M's in the garbage. He throws out all of his cupcakes
except for one. He takes a bite, tries to throw it but again,
can't. He takes another bite, holds it over the garbage, then
takes one last bite before dumping what little remains.


<b>INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

Pete runs on a treadmill while getting an electrocardiogram.

</b>          Oh. It's 1974.

<b>                    NURSE #2
</b>          Because on your last form you said
          that you were born in 1975.

<b>                    DR. PELLIGRINO
</b>          Didn't you tell me you were born in
<b>          1976?

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          I'm not going to "go" with 1974, it

<b>                    DR. PELLIGRINO
</b>          It's okay. It's 1976.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          I lie about my age, okay?

<b>                       DR. PELLIGRINO

Pete walks to the front door. His father, LARRY, greets him.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          Hey, Boychik.

A low flying 747 lets us know he lives too close to the
airport in a small house.

<b>                    LARRY (CONT'D)
</b>          That's the eleven o'clock from
          London.
              (yells up at the plane)
          Drop something valuable, you shit.
              (back to Pete)
          How are you?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          That's loud.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          Every eight minutes, buddy.


<b>INT. LARRY'S HOUSE - DAY

Pete sits down and talks with Larry.

<b>                     LARRY
</b>          You look pretty good. Your hair is
          different.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Yeah, I'm growing it out.
<b>                                                        42.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          I'd get it cut.

<b>                    TRIPLET #1
</b>          Daddy, you never play with me.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          I do but right now look who I'm
          talking to. It's your brother.

<b>                    TRIPLET #1
</b>          You don't look like my brother.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          I told you honey, that's because of
          the egg donor. Remember?

<b>                    TRIPLET #1
</b>          I came from a test tube.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          How's business?

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          It's not good. Nobody wants
          curtains. They think of it like a
          luxury. It's not a luxury. You need
          shade, you need privacy. Who wants
          to have other people watch you
          fuck?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          I know how you feel. You know my
          business is going through some
          growing pains right now.

Two other identical children enter and jump on Larry.

<b>                    TRIPLET #2
</b>          Daddy come play with us.

The kids crawl around on him.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          Be careful, don't jump on Daddy.
          Remember, Daddy has high blood
          what?

<b>                    TRIPLETS
</b>          Blood pressure.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          That's right. Can you go outside
          without me for a little bit?

<b>                    LARRY (CONT'D)
</b>          All right? Do the Three Stooges
          routine you were practicing.

The three exit.

<b>                    LARRY (CONT'D)
</b>          I can't tell them apart. I swear to
          god. I need tattoos.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Look, I wanted to talk to you about
          scaling back a little bit. You
          know, Deb and I are thinking about
          selling the house.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          I think that house is more than you
          need. I think it was too big of a
          purchase when you made it.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Yeah. In the meantime, I'm going to
          have to make some changes. Going to
          have to cut back.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          What do you mean?

<b>                      PETE
</b>          With you.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          Oh. I'm sorry, what?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          I can't lend you any more money.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          No, that's a bad idea. That's not
          the way to cut back. I have three
          children, here.

<b>                     PETE
</b>          What about Claire? Why can't she
          get a job?

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          Claire takes care of your brothers.
          What do you want her to do? If she
          goes to work, then I've got to hire
          somebody.
<b>                                                   44.
</b>

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Well you've got to figure something
          out because I can't do it.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          Okay, fine. Why don't we kill them?
          Come on, we'll kill two of them.
          I'll keep the best one. Really, it
          will save us both a lot of trouble.

Larry stands up and walks outside. Pete follows.


<b>EXT. LARRY'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Larry prepares to spray the kids with the hose.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          Line up! Line up for murder! Come
          on! Who wants to be killed?

<b>                       TRIPLET #1
</b>          I do!

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          Okay, we're eliminating one, we're
          cheaper already.

Larry sprays him with the hose.

<b>                       TRIPLET #2
</b>          Murder me!

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          Boom, dead. You're dead.

<b>                       TRIPLET #2

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          All right, the kids are murdered.
          That will save us some money.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Why would you have three kids,
          anyway? I mean, you're sixty years
          old. You have no money.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          Because Claire wanted a baby. If we
          didn't at least try, she would have
          left me. She was forty-five years
          old. Nobody thought it would take.

<b>                    LARRY (CONT'D)
</b>          The doctor when we were doing in
          vitro was winking at me like,
          "Don't worry, don't worry." We were
          very unlucky. And now we have these
          three beautiful children... Come
          on, I've got to tell you something.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          What?

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          Your mother wanted you aborted.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Oh, Jesus Christ.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          It's the truth. It was the
          seventies. We were twenty-two years
          old. That's what everybody did. You
          did some blow, had sex, had an
          abortion.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Really.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          Yes. We were on the way to the
          doctor's office. I said, "Let's
          stop, have a pizza, talk about it,
          if you still want to do it after
          lunch, it's okay." The pizza saved
          your life. But don't give me money.
          Because I'm not worth it.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          So how much do I owe you for saving
          my life?

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          I don't have a number. You just
          keep giving like you're giving.

Larry's wife, CLAIRE, enters.

<b>                    CLAIRE
</b>          Oh, hi Pete.

          Pete's just talking to me about his
          fortieth birthday party... Whatever
          I can do to help.

<b>                    CLAIRE
</b>          Okay. Did you feed them?

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          I fed half of one. Okay, let's feed
          them. Who wants tuna with a side of

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Oh, he's not with Sony anymore. He
          went out on his own. Now he's able
          to focus on the artists that he's
          really passionate about.

<b>                    OLIVER
</b>          How's Sadie doing? Last time I saw
          her she was throwing her Cheerios
          on the floor. What a mess.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          She just got her period.

<b>                    OLIVER
</b>          Well. I guess she's not a little
          baby anymore.

<b>                    DEBBIE

<b>                    OLIVER
</b>          Well, we can certainly arrange for
          that. I'd love to see the girls.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          That would be nice. Do you have a
          good day?

<b>                    OLIVER
</b>          I would say the weekends, but our
          weekends are hell. Soccer
          competitions, kids exams. I mean,
          we're both so busy. I have young
          children, you have young children.
          I don't think we should judge
          ourselves too harshly about that.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          I know, I wasn't. I'm glad we're
          here. I think this is a good start
          and that if we can spend more time
          together, it would be nice.

<b>                    OLIVER
</b>          It would be nice.
              (pause)
          Do you want to see pictures of the
          kids?

Oliver takes out his iPhone and starts showing Debbie photos.

<b>                    OLIVER (CONT'D)
</b>          This is Kell, my son.

</b>          He's handsome. He's thirteen?

<b>                    OLIVER
</b>          Yeah. And that's Alexandra, my
          daughter, she's a real
          perfectionist. A lot like you.
          That's the whole gang at Cabo.
              (pause)
          Will you excuse me, dear? I've got
          to use the restroom. Be right back.

through all the happy pictures of his new family.


<b>EXT. HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

</b>          What is that, grilled cheeses?

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          No, baked tofu. It's actually
          really tasty. And the lettuce is so
          fresh and tasty that you forget how
          good lettuce tastes on its own
          without dressing.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Yeah, dressing always gets in the
          way of the natural taste of the
          lettuce.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          And another thing we've decided is
          to cut back on all of the
          electronics we use. What we're
          going to do is get rid of the wi-fi
          and only use the computer from

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          We're going to have a hard line in
          the kitchen.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Yeah, we'll supervise that.

<b>                    SADIE
</b>          You can't do this. You can't take

No wi-fi! Ha-ha-ha!

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>You don't spend enough time with
the family when you're constantly
on your iPhone and your computer.
You're only here five more years.

<b>          SADIE
</b>So you won't see me after five
years?

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>No, but you won't be living with
us. And you should get to know your
little sister.

<b>          PETE
</b>You've got the perfect friend right
here.

<b>          SADIE
</b>I don't want to be friends with her
now. I'll be friends with her when
she's twenty and a normal person.

<b>          CHARLOTTE
</b>I don't want to hang out with her

more.

</b>Yeah. You can build things. You can
build a fort.

</b>What?

<b>                    PETE

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Play Kick the Can.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Nobody said you were bad.

<b>                    SADIE
</b>          I don't do things I'm not supposed

<b>                    PETE

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          I mean I can't take it. With the
          hormones, and the crying, and "do

<b>                    PETE

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Them's lil' bitches! Bugging us for

<b>EXT. LAGUNA HOTEL - CONTINUOUS
</b>
The car pulls up to a beautiful hotel in Laguna.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          I miss them already. Should we go

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>Why do we fight?

<b>          PETE
</b>I don't know, it makes no sense at
all.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>It makes no sense.

<b>          PETE
</b>When we get in a fight, look in my
eyes. Let's remember this moment
right now and know that we never
have to fight.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>But you're such a dick sometimes.

<b>          PETE
</b>I know, I am a dick sometimes.
People think I'm so nice, but I'm
such a dick.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>Thank you for admitting that.

<b>          PETE
</b>And you get so mad at me. I feel
like you want to kill me.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>I do want to kill you.

<b>          PETE
</b>How would you do it?

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>I don't know... poison you. I'd
poison your cupcakes that you
pretend not to eat everyday. And
just put enough in to slowly weaken
you.

<b>             PETE
</b>I love it.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>I would enjoy our last few months
together.

<b>             PETE
</b>Me too.

</b>

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Because you'd be so weak and sweet,
          and I could take care of you but
          while killing you.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          See? You know what I love about us?
          You can still surprise me. I
          figured for sure you'd knock me out
          with one fell swoop. But you would
          extend it over a series of months.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Have you ever thought about killing
          me?

<b>                      PETE
</b>          Oh, yeah.

<b>                      DEBBIE
</b>          Really?

<b>                      PETE
</b>          Sure.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          How would you do it?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Wood chipper.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          A wood chipper?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Did you see Fargo?

<b>                      DEBBIE

Pete makes a wood chipping splatter noise.

<b>                    DEBBIE (CONT'D)
</b>          Wow. That's a bad plan. The
          cupcakes is a way better plan.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          It is. You know what? I won't

</b>          What?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          A medical marijuana cookie. Ben

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          What?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Chocolate chip koo-kie.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Should we do it?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Let's eat the cookie, and then
          we'll order a bunch of
          cheeseburgers. Let's order the
          entire room service menu.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Just get all of it. You deserve it.
          You really do.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Wouldn't you rather have me around
          for less years and I'm incredibly
          happy than longer and miserable?

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Yes, and I just realized that right
          now. Go get the cookie!

Pete runs into the bathroom. He looks for the cookie.

<b>                    DEBBIE (CONT'D)
</b>          Should we watch porn when we eat
          the cookie?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Should we get a block of porn?

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          I don't think we need twenty-four
          hours of porn.
<b>                                                        56.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Yeah, but you know, two porns cost
          about as much as a block.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          I think that's too much porn.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          We don't have to watch it all, but
          for the value it makes sense.

Pete and Debbie eat the cookie.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          How much are we supposed to eat?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          I don't know. I think like six or
          seven cookies, right?

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Plus, it's old. It probably has
          lost some of its-

<b>                       PETE
</b>          Potency?

They sit in silence for an incredibly long amount of time,
staring through each other in a haze. They are stoned.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          We should have sex. More.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          I mean, girls have it so easy. You

          organs and you're good to go. All
          the pressure is on the guy.

<b>                       DEBBIE
</b>          It's true.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          And I look at guys, like I look at
          a guy like Prince, and you know
          that guy fucks. I know I don't fuck
          like Prince. Prince can fuck. I
          fuck more like David Schwimmer.

Stoned, Pete and Debbie jump up and down on the bed.

They fall down on the bed, kissing.

Almost totally under the covers, they watch as a WAITER
brings in a room service cart full of food.

Pete does magic tricks for the waiter.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          How does he do it? The floating
          spoon.

Debbie hands Pete a banana and two oranges, which he holds to
his crotch in front of the waiter.

<b>                    PETE (CONT'D)

Pete eats a bite of the banana.

Debbie crawls on the floor while Pete lays in bed.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          I'm going to deep throat this
          eclair.

She tries to deep throat it. Pete loves it.

</b>          I want to make out with you so bad.


<b>INT./EXT. CAR - DAY
</b>
Pete and Debbie drive back from Laguna. They could not look
happier or more refreshed. They hold hands and smile at each
other. It is a beautiful day.

They pull up to their house, shut off the car and sit for a
beat, knowing they're about to head back into the stress of
the real world, not wanting their peaceful, loving time to
end.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          That was nice.

<b>                    DEBBIE

Sadie walks outside. Jodi follows her.

<b>                    SADIE
</b>          Mom! Charlotte's crying. She's got
          an ear infection again.

<b>                    JODI

</b>              (to Pete)
          I told you the pediatrician didn't
          know what he was talking about.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Oh, come on. You can't blame it on
          our doctor. Ear infections are
          common in little kids.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Not in kids over six years old.
          We're going to the Eastern doctor.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          If she's in this much pain, we
          should call a real doctor.

<b>                    DEBBIE

Charlotte sits on the table. Pete and Debbie are talking to
DR. SEDUKU, a foreign doctor.

<b>                    DOCTOR SEDUKU
</b>          What we should do is easy and
          simple. No more dairy, no more
          wheat, no more sugar.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Sugar, wheat and dairy. Okay.

<b>                    PETE
</b>              (mutters)
          What the fuck is left? Sorry. Isn't

<b>                     DOCTOR SEDUKU
</b>          She can have vegetables and
          f-r-ruits.

Dr. Seduku has both an accent and a lisp.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Oh, she can eat fr-r-ruits.

<b>                    DOCTOR SEDUKU

<b>                       DOCTOR SEDUKU
</b>          No, no.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          What about F-r-r-rench f-r-r-ries?
          Can we do something like that?

<b>                    DOCTOR SEDUKU

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Why don't you go on the table? It

<b>EXT. BRENTWOOD - DAY

Pete cycles with the crew.


<b>INT. HOUSE - DAY - LATER
</b>
Debbie looks around the house for Pete.

<b>                       DEBBIE
</b>          Pete!
<b>                                                        61.

<b>INT. BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
Debbie sees Pete on the bed, his legs up in the air. He still
has his bike top on but is naked from the waist down.

He is trying to look at his back end. He is holding a mirror
and an iPhone.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          What are you doing?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          I need you to look at something. In
          my butt.

<b>                     DEBBIE
</b>          Why?

<b>                     PETE
</b>          I think I've got something in
          there, and I'm not limber enough to
          see. I need you to look at it. I
          might have like an anal fissure or
          a hemorrhoid or a worm or
          something.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          What are you doing with your phone?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Trying to take pictures of it, so I
          can compare it to something on
          Google.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Can we just keep like a small shred
          of mystery in our relationship?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Look, I saw you have two babies,
          okay? Seriously, I need you to get
          all up in that.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          I do not want to investigate your
          anus.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          It's payback time.

Pete has his naked legs hiked up over his head. Debbie takes
a very quick glance inside.
<b>                                                        62.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          It's a hemorrhoid.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Thank you. Now erase that from your
          memory.


<b>INT. DEBBIE'S STORE - DAY
</b>
Debbie talks to Jodi while they fold clothes and watch Desi.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Where did she get those clothes?
          Those are expensive.

<b>                     JODI
</b>          Where do you think? I don't want
          this to sound harsh, but everything
          that comes out of her mouth is a
          lie. Everything that comes into it
          is a dick.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Everything that goes in is dicks?

<b>                      JODI
</b>          A dick.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Don't say that.

<b>                    JODI
</b>          I'm sorry, I'm just being
          protective of the store.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          I'm going to go talk to her.

Debbie walks over to Desi.

<b>                     DEBBIE (CONT'D)
</b>          Hey Desi. Is that your new Acura
          out front?

<b>                      DESI
</b>          Uh, yeah.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          It's so nice. Do you love it?

<b>                    DESI
</b>          Well, I mean, it's not a fucking
          Porsche, but it'll do for now.
<b>                                                        63.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Hey Desi, would you mind wearing
          some of the clothes we have in the
          store?

<b>                    DESI
</b>          Yeah, sure. I'm sorry.

Desi picks a shirt.

<b>                       DESI (CONT'D)
</b>          Good?

Desi begins to take all her clothes off in front of Debbie.

<b>                    DESI (CONT'D)
</b>          You know, I actually made this one
          myself.

<b>                       DEBBIE
</b>          Did you?

<b>                    DESI
</b>          Yeah. I did the tiger on a piece of
          paper separately, and then I
          transferred it to the t-shirt.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Wow. So you stenciled on the tiger?

<b>                    DESI
</b>          I drew it on a piece of paper, and
          then I transferred the drawing to
          the t-shirt.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          You have an amazing body.

<b>                       DESI
</b>          Really?

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Yes. Are those real?

<b>                    DESI
</b>          My boobs? Yeah... Do you want to
          touch them?

<b>                       DEBBIE
</b>          Really?

<b>                       DESI
</b>          Touch `em!
<b>                                                        64.
</b>

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Okay.

Debbie squeezes Desi's breasts.

<b>                    DEBBIE (CONT'D)
</b>          Wow. Jesus. I mean they really are
          amazing. That's firm, for real.
          They're like a memory mattress.
          Like Tempurpedic, you know? They
          look amazing. My kids just sucked
          the meat right out of mine.

<b>                    DESI
</b>          No. There's some meat in there.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Since I had kids, my boobs are just
          gone. They didn't even say goodbye.
          They just left.

<b>                    DESI
</b>          By the time I'm forty, these are
          going to go National Geographic on
          me.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          I feel bad about myself right now.


<b>INT. RECORD LABEL - DAY
</b>
Pete talks is in his office on the phone with his REALTOR.

<b>                    REALTOR (O.C.)
</b>          I think this is a really good offer
          on the house.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          We expected more. I mean, I know
          it's a bad market but that's still
          way under what we were looking for.

<b>                    REALTOR (O.C.)
</b>          I know, but based on the market,
          it's like you're gaining money.
          Because it's so much more than what
          you deserve. But these people are
          from Iran and they don't really
          know that they're offering too
          much. Is there any chance that
          Debbie will go for it?
<b>                                                        65.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          I doubt it. I don't know.

<b>                    REALTOR (O.C.)
</b>          There's a lot of inventory out
          there. What's her problem?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          She has unrealistic expectations.


<b>EXT. YARD - DAY
</b>
Sadie and her friend WENDY run around the yard with Charlotte
and the triplets.


<b>INT. KITCHEN PANTRY - DAY
</b>
Larry and Debbie greet the kids when they enter the kitchen.
Larry picks up one of the triplets.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          Did you miss me Travis?

<b>                       TRIPLET #1
</b>          It's Jack!

<b>                       LARRY
</b>          Hey, Jack.

<b>                    TRIPLET #1
</b>          My daddy doesn't know my name.

<b>                    CHARLOTTE
</b>          Can I go show them my crystals
          before they leave?

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Yeah, really quick.

Charlotte leaves with the triplets.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          Go play with your tiny uncles.
              (to Debbie)
          So, what are you doing, spring
          cleaning?

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          I'm getting rid of everything in
          the house that has gluten or sugar.
<b>                                      66.
</b>

<b>          LARRY
</b>Why? What's wrong with gluten?

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>Gluten's really bad for you.

<b>          LARRY
</b>I don't think so. It's wheat.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>Don't you watch Dr. Oz?

<b>          LARRY
</b>As in the Wizard of?

<b>          SADIE
</b>Hey, Mom. We were wondering if we
could use the computer to iChat.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>Remember the rules? Eight to eight-
thirty?

<b>          SADIE
</b>Yeah, but I have a friend over.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>Hi Wendy. Why don't you guys go
play? You could go build a fort!

<b>          LARRY
</b>Remember the Alamo?

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>Have you ever built a fort, Wendy?

<b>          WENDY
</b>Like on Facebook?

<b>          LARRY
</b>I will take this if you're going to
throw it away, because at our
house, we're wheat eaters.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>But don't you want to live long
enough to see your kids grow up?

<b>          LARRY
</b>That's up to god, honey.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>But that's really not good for the
kids.
<b>                                                   67.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          The kids eat grass. This is fine.

Larry takes some of the food she's throwing out.

<b>                     SADIE
</b>          Wendy's mom lets her go on whenever
          she wants.

<b>                    WENDY
</b>          My mom's pretty cool about it as
          long as I finish my homework.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Yeah. Well, I guess I'm not the
          cool one. But the rules are just
          different in our house.

<b>                    SADIE
</b>          But I get better grades than Wendy.

<b>                    WENDY
</b>          She does. She's so smart.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          Let me just grab the candy worms.

<b>                    SADIE
</b>          Your rules are ridiculous.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Don't sass me.

<b>                    SADIE
</b>          I'm only sassing you because you're
          throwing out all the food in our
          house and I'm freaking starving.
          You're being stupid.

<b>                    DEBBIE

Wendy exits.

<b>                    SADIE
</b>          I need my computer to do homework.

before anyone notices him.

<b>                       LARRY

<b>INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Pete and Debbie are in bed. Pete is reading Sadie's iChats on
her confiscated iPad out loud to Debbie.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          What else did they say?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Some kid named Joseph--

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          I know Joseph.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          You do? He's making a "Hot or Not"
          list.

<b>                       DEBBIE
</b>          What?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          So, Sadie said, "That's so   lame and
          immature that you're doing   that."
          And then Joseph says, "Yo,   girl.
          We're just having some fun   so don't
          be a bitch, yo."

<b>                    DEBBIE

<b>                    PETE
</b>          So, then Sadie said, "Don't call me
          a bitch." And Joseph said, "I
          didn't call you a bitch, I said
          don't act like a bitch. And by the
          way you're in the `Not Hot'
          column."

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Who made him the judge of hot?

<b>                    PETE

<b>                    PETE
</b>          For some reason, there's an
          emoticon of a panda doing push-ups.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          I wonder what that means.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          I don't think it means anything, I
          think it's just adorable.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Aww. She's a good girl. She was
          polite, and she stood up for
          herself.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          That's pretty cool.

</b>          Oh my god, that scared me to death.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          If she caught us, she would kill
          us.

Debbie starts looking through the iPad. Pete's iPhone chimes.
He sees a message from Ronnie from work. It reads: "Got the
numbers. Call me."

Pete looks ashen. He looks over at Debbie who is oblivious.

<b>                    PETE

          We sold how many?

<b>                     RONNIE (O.C.)
</b>          Six hundred and twelve album
          downloads.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Wait a minute. There are no zeros
          after that?

<b>                    RONNIE (O.C.)
</b>          There are zeros, but all of them
          are before six hundred and twelve.
          There are none after.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          How is that even possible?

<b>                    RONNIE (O.C.)
</b>          Out of three hundred million
          Americans, six hundred and twelve
          people chose to download the album.
          You could personally call everyone
          who bought this record.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          We're fucked! Here's the deal. I

</b>          You heard.

<b>                    ACCOUNTANT
</b>          And they're bad. You know, it's
          that, and it's the money that he's
          been lending to his father, that's
          creating a strain.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          How much have we lent him?

<b>                    ACCOUNTANT
</b>          Eighty thousand.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Did you say "eight thousand" or
          "eighty thousand"?
<b>                                                        73.
</b>

<b>                    ACCOUNTANT
</b>          Eighty thousand, over the past

</b>          On the house?

<b>                    ACCOUNTANT

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Does Pete know that?

<b>                    ACCOUNTANT

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Yeah.

<b>                    DR. PELLIGRINO
</b>          I usually don't say impossible. I
          like to leave some wiggle room.
<b>                                                76.
</b>

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          You said that my fibroid was like a
          giant boulder, like the one from
          the Indiana Jones movies blocking
          up my uterus.

<b>                    DR. PELLIGRINO
</b>          And I need to stop using that
          reference of Indiana Jones. I think

          about the reproductive system.

<b>                       DEBBIE
</b>          It's okay.

<b>                    DR. PELLIGRINO
</b>          Anyway, somehow the Eastern
          medicine has worked and the fibroid
          has dissipated.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          That's great.

<b>                    DR. PELLIGRINO
</b>          Yes. Your fibroid shrunk, and

          pregnant.

<b>                       DEBBIE
</b>          What?

that I'm giving you anything.

<b>          LARRY
</b>Well, you're not giving me money.
You're giving me a project. I don't
know how to sell this. I'm not an

<b>          PETE
</b>Just sell it online. Do some
research, make some calls. Or is
that too hard to do with your high
blood pressure?

<b>          LARRY
</b>All right. Don't get snippy. Just
because you write a great song
doesn't mean you can draw.

<b>          PETE
</b>It's incredible. John Lennon drew
it.

<b>          LARRY
</b>I think it's a Ringo. Don't beat me
up if I get three hundred dollars
for it.

<b>          PETE
</b>Don't take less than sixty-five

          All the other little kids, "Where's
          your mommy?" "Oh, she's the one
          sitting in that scooter eating a
          soft cracker." Kids don't want to
          have old parents. You know, it
          would also be nice for us to spend
          some time apart. Kind of rediscover
          who we are individually. It would
          be so great to not see you for like
          a chunk of time so that I could

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          I'm Sadie's mom.

<b>                      JOSEPH
</b>          Sadie...?

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Sadie, the one you chat with on the
          internet?

<b>                    JOSEPH
</b>          Nah, man. That ain't me.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Well, it was you, I saw your
          picture. Did you make a "Hot" list
          and not put Sadie on the "Hot"
          list?

<b>                    JOSEPH
</b>          She was not on my list, no.
<b>                                                       81.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          You know what I'm going to do? I'm
          going to make my own "Hot" list,
          and you know what? You're on the
          "Not Hot" list. How does that feel?

<b>                    JOSEPH
</b>          It doesn't bother me. I'm
          comfortable with the way I am.

She gets even quieter, scarier and more in his face.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Maybe you shouldn't be so
          comfortable with yourself. You know
          why? You look like a miniature Tom
          Petty. How's that feel? Huh? You
          think that haircut's cool? It's
          not. It looks like you put your
          Justin Bieber wig on backwards. You
          still comfortable with yourself?
          Why are you wearing a tank top?
          Huh? So you can show off your bald
          pits, you little hairless wonder?
          Cool tank top, man. So next time
          you think about writing something
          nasty on my daughter's Facebook
          page, just remember me. Remember
          me. I will come down here, and I
          will fuck you up.

Joseph looks upset.

<b>                    JOSEPH
</b>          Okay, I'm sorry.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Wait a minute. Hey. Are you crying?

<b>                    JOSEPH
</b>          Just let me go.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          I'm sorry. I'm not in my right
          head.

<b>                    JOSEPH
</b>          I understand. My mom is going
          through menopause, too. It's a hard
          time.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          What did you say?
<b>                                                        82.

<b>                    JOSEPH
</b>          You're going through menopause?

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          I'm not going through menopause!
          I'm not going to go through
          menopause for twenty years. I'm
          pregnant you little bitch. God damn
          it!

She storms off.

Debbie and Desi are talking as they walk down the stairs into

<b>                    DESI

<b>                    HOCKEY PLAYER
</b>          We play hockey.

<b>                    DESI

<b>                    HOCKEY PLAYER #2

He takes a plate of his teeth out.

<b>                    HOCKEY PLAYER #2 (CONT'D)
</b>          Want to try them on?

Desi takes them and tries to put them in her mouth. Everyone
laughs.

<b>                    DESI
</b>          Do I look sexy?

Desi looks insane. She tries to kiss Debbie. Everyone is
laughing.

<b>                    HOCKEY PLAYER #3
</b>          They definitely look way better on
          her than they do on you.

She hands the teeth back to their owner. He pops them back in
and everyone cheers.

</b>          Thank you so much for coming, this
          is so exciting! For the first time
          in over thirty years, Graham Parker
          and The Rumour.

Pete watches Graham Parker perform with his band. The song is
amazing. It is about issues Pete is going through, and he is
really connecting.

<b>                    PETE (CONT'D)

</b>Yes. I want you to come by the
hotel with me.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>Well, what would we do there?

<b>          JAY
</b>Maybe we can find somewhere quiet,
have fun, and see where it goes.
Like adults do sometimes.

<b>             DEBBIE
</b>Like, sex?

<b>          JAY
</b>I mean, if you want. If that's on
the docket. I'm not trying to force
that.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>So you would do sex with me?

</b>Do sex? What are you, Borat?

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>Are you hitting on me?

<b>          JAY
</b>Yes. I'm hitting on you. You're hot
and cool and nice and you have
beautiful eyes.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>I'm sorry. I'm married, I have two
kids, and I'm pregnant.

<b>          JAY
</b>That is what we call the "hat

</b>I'm sorry I didn't tell you. I'm
just really enjoying you being so
nice to me.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Ah, so you were expecting it to
          sell. They never sell anymore. They

</b>          You did?

</b>          Huh.

<b>                    DESI
</b>          One year I did it twenty.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          As long as you think it's safe.

<b>                    DESI
</b>          It's safe. I only do it ten to

<b>                       DEBBIE
</b>             I don't know. I just want him to
             want me. I don't want him to want
             me because I'm pregnant.

</b>             Go home and suck his dick and tell

</b>             He'll be so excited. Or even better

Pause.

<b>                      PETE
</b>          Yeah.

<b>                    DEBBIE

          anything?

<b>                    PETE

She exits into the bathroom. There's silence.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          I didn't realize it was
          intentional! I didn't say anything

No response.

</b>          All right, fine, I'm an asshole.

Debbie returns, dressed.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          You know what your problem is?

You don't like me. I can feel that.

<b>                    CATHERINE
</b>          Don't touch me.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          I didn't touch you.

<b>                    CATHERINE
</b>          You touched my upper breast!

<b>                    PETE
</b>          I didn't. I got right below your
          shoulder.

<b>                    CATHERINE
</b>          You got right here.
              (to Joseph)
          He hit my nipple!

<b>                      JOSEPH
</b>          You what?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          You're insane.

<b>                    CATHERINE
</b>          Why would you do that?

<b>                    JOSEPH
</b>          Did you just touch my mom's nipple?

<b>                    CATHERINE
</b>          He just touched my nipple! Why
          would you do that?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          I poked you on the shoulder.

<b>                    CATHERINE
</b>          I have very high nipples.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          I touched your shirt.

<b>                    CATHERINE
</b>          What do you think is under my
          shirt? My breasts are under my
          shirt.
              (to Joseph)
          He just touched my breast.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Your shoulder, your shoulder.

<b>                    CATHERINE
</b>          That's a funny place to put a

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Hello! There are children around.

<b>                    CATHERINE

<b>INT. VICE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
Pete and Debbie are sitting across from VICE PRINCIPAL
LAVIANI. In another seat is Joseph's mother, Catherine.

<b>                    MS. LAVIANI
</b>          Joseph was very upset when I spoke
          to him about this, so I thought it
          was important that we join together
          and work this through.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Absolutely.
<b>                                                104.
</b>

<b>                    CATHERINE
</b>          We're going to work through it, but
          Debbie told my son that he looked
          like Tom Petty, in a negative way--

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Who's Tom Petty?

<b>                    CATHERINE
</b>          You know who Tom Petty is. And she
          said that if she had to come back,
          that she was going to "F up his
          pussy ass." Which is what she said.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Are you serious? I didn't. I would
          never. To a child? Your son has
          been defiling my daughter's
          Facebook page now for months.

<b>                    CATHERINE
</b>          These people are liars. He said
          that my son was an animal and that
          if I didn't keep him on a leash
          that he would hit him with his car.

<b>                    MS. LAVIANI
</b>          Did you say that?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          That's ridiculous. Who talks like
          that?

<b>                    CATHERINE
</b>          You do.

Debbie tries to hide a smile.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          He didn't say that.

<b>                    CATHERINE
</b>          He said it. To me.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          What I said was that we need to
          keep an extra eye on our kids
          because with all the technological
          advances, they need to learn to use
          them responsibly.

<b>                    CATHERINE
</b>          No. He called me an "iCunt."
<b>                                      105.
</b>

<b>          PETE
</b>A what?

<b>          MS. LAVIANI
</b>Language, Catherine!

<b>          CATHERINE
</b>How am I going to relay what these
two nutballs said to me unless I
say it.

<b>           MS. LAVIANI
</b>Can you please not talk like that,
Catherine? Music Man is rehearsing
next door.

<b>          CATHERINE
</b>Sorry, fucking Music Man. Maybe if
I looked more like this fake
bullshit couple, looks like they're
in a bank commercial. That's what
you look like. Like a bullshit bank
commercial couple.

<b>          MS. LAVIANI
</b>None of this talk is productive.

<b>          CATHERINE
</b>I'd like to rear up and jackknife
my legs and kick you both in the
jaw with my foot bone.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>You're just really scaring me.

<b>          CATHERINE
</b>This is what happens when you
corner a rat. You corner me, I will
chew through you.

<b>          MS. LAVIANI
</b>Catherine, you're better than this.

<b>          CATHERINE
</b>Fuck you, Jill. You're a horrible
woman. This is why everybody hates
you. This kind of shit.
Ineffective. Bullshit hair. And I'm
glad your husband died. Because
you're a fucking asshole. He
probably killed himself.

<b>                    MS. LAVIANI
</b>          Okay, Catherine. I think we know
          what's happening now.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Now you know what we're dealing
          with.


<b>EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

Pete and Debbie leave the school together, surpressing
smiles. They get in separate cars and drive off.


<b>INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b>
Debbie is making dinner. Pete and Charlotte sit at the table.

<b>                    CHARLOTTE
</b>          I'm not going to eat that chicken.

<b>                       DEBBIE
</b>          Why not?

<b>                    CHARLOTTE
</b>          Because I feel like I'm going to be
          a vegetarian.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Can you become a vegetarian
          tomorrow?

<b>                       CHARLOTTE
</b>          No.

Sadie storms in.

<b>                    SADIE
</b>          You guys have been reading my
          texts?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          No, we haven't.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Yes, we have. We're supposed to
          keep an eye on you.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          How did you find out?
<b>                                      107.
</b>

<b>          SADIE
</b>Joseph told me that you flipped out
on him and his mom and that you
guys are nuts, and I agree.

<b>          PETE
</b>Don't be disrespectful.

<b>          SADIE
</b>You're the ones who are
disrespectful. Reading my texts is
like reading my diary.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>You were really sweet on your
iChat. We were really proud of you.

<b>          PETE
</b>Yeah, we were going to give you
your computer and phone back.

<b>            SADIE
</b>Fuck you!

<b>          PETE
</b>Okay, there's the first official
"Fuck you."

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>That is not how we talk to each
other in this house.

<b>          SADIE
</b>You guys talk to each other like
that all the time! And to Joseph
and his mom. You made Joseph cry.

<b>          CHARLOTTE
</b>Joseph has a crush on you. You like
a boy who cries.

<b>          SADIE
</b>Shut up, Charlotte. You guys so
desperately want me to be perfect
and to make no mistakes. Well, you
two are fucking insane.

<b>            DEBBIE
</b>Okay.
<b>                                                       108.

<b>                    SADIE
</b>          All you do is fight. Or you don't
          fight, which is even worse because
          it looks like you hate each other
          for weeks. You obsess over every
          little thing I do, and you don't
          trust in me or believe in me. Well,
          I'm fucking sick of it! Yeah, I
          said "fuck." Fuck fuck fuck. Ground
          me forever I don't care. I don't
          care about anything.
              (crying hard)
          I hate everything, everyone's going
          crazy, I don't care if I have no
          friends.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Are you still upset about Lost?

<b>                    SADIE
</b>          Of course I'm upset about Lost! You
          guys took away my shit before I
          could watch the last two episodes!
          I don't know what the fuck happens!

She walks off.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          She's becoming just like us.

<b>                    CHARLOTTE
</b>          I hope I never get my period if
          this is what happens.


<b>INT. SADIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Sadie does her homework on her bed. Charlotte brings in
Sadie's electronics and puts them down in a pile beside her.

<b>                    SADIE
</b>          Where did you find these?

<b>                    CHARLOTTE
</b>          I stole them.

Charlotte walks away and starts to slide the door closed
behind her.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Our kids are crazy. And it's our

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Do you think there's anything we
          can do to turn it around?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Sadie's thirteen. She might be a
          lost cause.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Where did she learn that kind of
          language? We don't talk like that.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          I have no fucking idea... Do you
          think Sadie is this crazy because
          of us? Or is it hormones and Lost.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          J.J. Abrams. He's ruining our
          daughter. That fucking geek.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          I feel bad for us.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          All of a sudden we're like a magnet
          for negativity. Why do people keep
          attacking us? What did we do? We're
          just doing our best.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Should we talk about our fight?

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          I think we're under enough

<b>EXT. HOUSE - DAY

Debbie is speaking with Barb as they set up the kitchen for a
barbecue for Pete's fortieth birthday.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          I am so glad you're here. I need a

<b>                    BARB
</b>          Well, I'm ready to buff.

Desi jumps in the pool in a small bikini. She is playing in

<b>                    BARRY
</b>          So that's the girl who works for

</b>          Yeah, that's her.

<b>                    BARRY

<b>                    BARB

Angle on Barb and Debbie.

<b>                    DEBBIE

<b>EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

The party is in full swing. Pete, Debbie, Oliver, Barry and
Barb are getting food from the buffet. Barb and Barry are
trying to help keep the conversation going.

<b>                    BARRY
</b>          What do you do in Chino, Oliver?

<b>                    OLIVER
</b>          I am a surgeon.

<b>                    BARB
</b>          Wow, what kind?

<b>                    OLIVER
</b>          Mainly of the spine. My specialty
          is scoliosis surgery.
<b>                                                         116.
</b>

<b>                    BARRY
</b>          My mom used to talk to me like I
          had scoliosis because I'm a little
          hunchy, but that's a different
          thing.

<b>                    OLIVER
</b>          Well, you definitely don't look
          right.

Larry arrives, with Claire and the triplets. Claire is
holding two of them, while Larry carries one.

The triplets now have very different HAIRCUTS so he can tell
them apart. One has a faux hawk, one has bangs, and one has a
buzz cut.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          Hello everyone! I'm sorry we're
          late. I was in the lab cloning

          seven more tomorrow... Look, we cut
          their hair different so we can
          finally tell who they are.

Larry lifts one of the triplets up and down by the arms,
simulating an elevator.

<b>                    LARRY (CONT'D)
</b>          You like the new haircut, Travis?

<b>                    TRIPLET #1
</b>          I'm Jack, damn it.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          Of course you are.

Larry puts Jack down and he runs off.

<b>                    DEBBIE

Claire runs off.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          We won't see her now for the whole

</b>          Yeah, a little white wine.

<b>                    PETE

<b>                    CHARLOTTE
</b>          Is he your dad?

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          He is my biological father.

<b>                    CHARLOTTE
</b>          What does that mean?

<b>                    DEBBIE

Oliver gets up. Charlotte, Sadie and Desi run off. Oliver
follows.

<b>                    LARRY

Desi is gracefully swimming under water. She looks gorgeous.
She sees Jason and Ronnie under water, but they look
grotesque, red-faced and awkward. They both reach for each
other and come to the surface.

<b>                    JASON

<b>                    RONNIE

</b>          Sorry, the mustache is a little--

<b>                    JASON
</b>          That's fair.

<b>                    DESI
</b>          I just assumed.

<b>                    RONNIE
</b>          This is a straight man mustache.

<b>                    DESI
</b>          What is the different between a gay
          man's mustache and a straight man's

Pause.

<b>                       JASON
</b>          The smell.

<b>          LARRY
</b>So, spinal surgery just seems to me
to be at the top of the surgery
chain.

<b>          OLIVER
</b>Well, we're not cardio, we're not
neuro, but I like to think we're an
important part of the spectrum.

<b>          LARRY
</b>Do you operate every single day?

<b>             OLIVER
</b>Most days.

<b>          LARRY
</b>Multiple times a day?

<b>          OLIVER
</b>Three, four times.

<b>           LARRY
</b>So what's the price range? Like if
I wanted--

<b>          OLIVER
</b>Oh, I'd rather not say.

<b>          LARRY
</b>It's so big you're embarrassed to
say.

<b>          OLIVER
</b>I wouldn't say embarrassed.

<b>          LARRY
</b>Are there hunchbacks today?

<b>             OLIVER
</b>Of course.

<b>          LARRY
</b>I've never seen one.

<b>          OLIVER
</b>Well, that's because there are
spinal surgeons.

<b>          LARRY
</b>That's because of you. Each time I
don't see a hunchback, you're
getting that much richer.
<b>                                               121.

Oliver smiles, amused.

<b>                    DESI
</b>          Not for me, that's not good.

<b>                    RONNIE
</b>          That's not true.

<b>                    JASON

<b>                    RONNIE
</b>          What does it mean?

<b>                    DESI
</b>          That's really strange. Well, Taurus
          and Cancers are sort of soul mates
          of the Zodiac. We're like perfectly
          compatible. I balance what you
          lack, and you make up for what I
          lack. And a quiet Cancer almost
          always has a huge penis.

<b>                    JASON
</b>              (quietly)
          You're making me embarrassed.

<b>                    PETE

          You know? Put the past behind us.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          And live without resentments.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          But specifically who are you
          forgiving? I like to know the

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          I see. I know you have some issues
          with me, but I'm curious, what's he
          in for? Before today nobody even
          knew he existed.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          My parents divorced when I was
          really young and we don't spend
          that much time together and I'd
          like to work on that. Just like
          we'd like to work on how you have
          financial issues.

<b>                    BARRY

          She means all the lending. And the
          borrowing...

<b>                    LARRY

</b>          You are a beautiful woman, but you
          are not totally maxed out. I would
          say honestly, you're a six. Six and

          asking?

<b>                     OLIVER
</b>          Actually, we had lunch together

<b>          OLIVER
</b>It's been about seven years.

<b>          LARRY
</b>Seven years? That's a joke, right?
That's like two Olympics. And I'm
the bad guy. What Debbie doesn't
understand is that it's not bad to
help out a parent. And it's
certainly not bad for a parent to
help out a child. I'm sure Oliver
would agree.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>Are you really doing this right
now?

<b>          LARRY
</b>Am I doing what? I didn't start the
toast.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>Are you really about to hit up my
dad for money?

<b>          LARRY
</b>What? He does four operations a
day. It's perfect. It helps
everybody, and it relieves his
guilt from all the abandonment
issues.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>You can't buy forgiveness, right
Pete?

<b>          PETE
</b>I don't think anyone's looking for
handouts... We'd pay him back.

<b>          OLIVER
</b>If you two are in a bind I'd be
more than happy to help.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>No. It's not good to borrow money
from family members because it
causes resentment, remember?

<b>          PETE
</b>Yeah.

you want me to say? You happy?
Aren't I allowed a little joy with
these children I never wanted to
have?

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>You have never once stopped asking
us for money.

<b>          LARRY
</b>Family helps family.

<b>          PETE
</b>It's true. Family helps family.
Look, I don't expect you to fully
understand. Your dad left. You're
broken inside. It's not your fault
you can't feel love. There's
something that you can't -- this is
coming out wrong.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>You know what? I would rather have
my dad than your dad, because he
doesn't drive me crazy. You know
the best quality my father has? He
asks for nothing. I don't know what
the fuck he's thinking right now.
Look at that. Nothing. I don't even
know him. And I turned out
perfectly fine without his input.

<b>          LARRY
</b>I just figured out what your
problem is. You hate Jews. Which is
so odd because your children are
Jewish.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>Don't play the Jew card, Larry.

<b>          LARRY
</b>I'm not playing any Jew card.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>Seriously, it's used up.

</b>You can't use up a Jew card. That's
the whole point of a Jew card.

Oliver gets up to leave.

<b>                    PETE

          Oliver. See you later. See you in

          say goodbye to the grandkids, who
          you met today. You know, nothing I
          do is right because of you?
          Nothing. No matter how hard I try,
          I'm just the asshole here, but you
          know what I realized? It's you.
          You're the asshole.

          You just threw me under the bus.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          No. We agreed to let go and
          forgive, but then you started
          ripping into my dad like a crazy
          person.

<b>                    DEBBIE

</b>          I am not a ball buster. You make me
          one! I am a fun girl! I am fun-
          loving! I am a good time Sally! I
          dance hip-hop. I cannot believe
          I've wasted my whole life busting
          the balls of people who have no

          has any balls.

Debbie looks over and sees that Oliver never actually left.
He stands in the back looking uncomfortable, quietly singing.

          sneak out?

From the side of the house we see Pete storming by on his
bike, wearing his street clothes and a helmet.

<b>                    SADIE
</b>          Where's Dad going?

<b>EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY
</b>
Pete exits his home riding his bike. He is very angry. He
rides with great emotion like he is trying to get all the
frustration out of his body.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Best birthday ever!

Pete rides his bike onto San Vicente Boulevard.

Pete rides down the street. A CAR passes by him. When it does
a fifteen-year-old TEENAGER sticks his head out the window
and yells to scare Pete.

<b>                    TEENAGER
</b>          Bike lane, asshole!

Pete almost falls.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Fuck you, you Twilight pimply-ass
          motherfuckers!


<b>INT. KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
Debbie and Barb are cleaning up. They look out the window to
see Oliver picking up glasses and putting them in a bin.

<b>                    BARB
</b>          Your dad's still here.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          I know. It's weird. Where the hell
          is Pete?

Sadie walks in with Joseph.

<b>                    SADIE
</b>          Mom, is it okay if Joseph hangs out
          here for a while?

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Sure. Hi, Joseph.

<b>                     JOSEPH
</b>          Hi.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Do you want a piece of cake?

<b>                    JOSEPH
</b>          Oh, yeah sure. Thank you.
<b>                                                       135.
</b>

Sadie walks off.

<b>                    JOSEPH (CONT'D)
</b>          All right, then.

Joseph follows.

<b>                    BARB
</b>          They are so cute.

<b>                       DEBBIE
</b>          So cute.

<b>                    BARB
</b>          He looks exactly like Tom Petty.


<b>EXT. STREET - DAY
</b>
There is no bike lane and cars going very fast have to swerve
to avoid Pete. A car honks when traffic clogs up behind him.

<b>                       PETE
</b>          Go around!

A car makes a right turn, and Pete almost rides right into
it.

<b>                       PETE (CONT'D)
</b>          Watch it!

He pulls up alongside Jason's van. Desi is riding with Jason.

<b>                    DESI
</b>          Hey, Pete. Great party!

They speed off.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Yeah. The best!


<b>EXT. BACKYARD - DAY
</b>
Oliver and the kids are playing with an iPhone.

<b>                    SADIE
</b>          Then you shake it. And then a
          restaurant comes up.

Debbie walks outside.
<b>                                                       136.
</b>

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Dad? Excuse me. I'm going to go
          look for Pete. Would you mind
          staying with the girls for just a
          little bit?

<b>                    OLIVER
</b>              (shocked)
          Well, if you want me to.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          If you don't mind. You don't have
          to.

<b>                     OLIVER
</b>          Sure.
              (beat)
          Can I let Sadie show me the last
          episode of Lost? She asked me if
          I'd seen it, I haven't.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          That would be nice. Thank you.

<b>                       OLIVER
</b>          Thank you.

Debbie exits.

<b>                    OLIVER (CONT'D)
</b>              (to Sadie)
          She said we could watch it.

Sadie turns to Charlotte, puts her arm around her.

<b>                    SADIE
</b>          I'm going to let you watch Lost.
          Come on.

Charlotte smiles, delighted to be accepted by her sister.

<b>                    CHARLOTTE
</b>          Is it scary?

<b>                    SADIE
</b>          I'll cover your eyes if it gets too
          scary.
<b>                                                          137.
</b>

<b>EXT. STREET - DAY
</b>
Pete starts riding really fast and passes a car. When the car
stops for a red he keeps going, tears off to the left,
crosses four lanes of traffic in both directions and almost
gets hit.

Pete rides his bike up a steep hill.

He passes some other bikers almost hitting them.


<b>INT. DEBBIE'S CAR - DAY
</b>
Debbie drives around the neighborhood with Larry in the
passenger seat.

<b>                     LARRY
</b>          Are you mad at me? Did I say
          something?

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Shh. Larry, please.


<b>EXT. STREET - DAY
</b>
Pete flies down a steep hill going crazy fast. Close up of
his front wheel shaking. It is as if he wants to crash.

He rides down the street when suddenly a MAN IN A RANGE ROVER
opens his door to exit his car and Pete slams directly into
the man's car door -- hard, breaking the man's window and
falling to the ground.

The man is an incredibly thick fifty-five-year-old.

<b>                    MAN IN RANGE ROVER
</b>          Are you fucking kidding me?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          You opened your door on me.

<b>                    MAN IN RANGE ROVER
</b>          I didn't open my fucking door on
          you. I opened my door!

Pete slowly gets to his feet.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          I was right there! You are supposed
          to look before you open your door.
          I was in the fucking bike path.
<b>                                                       138.
</b>

<b>                    MAN IN RANGE ROVER
</b>          That's a blind spot. There's no
          fucking bike path. This is a
          residential section. Get your head
          out of your ass.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Pay attention!

<b>                    MAN IN RANGE ROVER
</b>          Open your god damn eyes. What are
          you doing, sleepwalking?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          You're supposed to look to see if a
          biker is coming through. You're
          supposed to look!

<b>                    MAN IN RANGE ROVER
</b>          It's not my job to look out for
          you. You look out for yourself. I
          don't look out for you. I don't see
          you. I don't now where the fuck you
          are and what you're doing.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          No one is ever looking out for me!

<b>                    MAN IN RANGE ROVER
</b>          I need your name and number.

<b>                      PETE
</b>          Why?

<b>                    MAN IN RANGE ROVER
</b>          Because you're going to pay for my
          door.


<b>INT. DEBBIE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS
</b>
They drive near the scene of Pete's accident and overhear.

<b>                      PETE (O.S.)
</b>          Fuck you!


<b>EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS
</b>
<b>                    PETE
</b>          Why don't you pay for my bike --
          and my face, you fucking prick!

The man punches Pete in the face where he's already bleeding.
<b>                                                         139.
</b>

<b>INT. DEBBIE'S CAR
</b>
Debbie sees the punch and gasps, realizing it's Pete.


<b>EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Pete looks stunned.

He punches the man in the gut, to no effect. The man punches
Pete back in the stomach. Pete sinks to the ground.

<b>                    MAN IN RANGE ROVER
</b>          Don't disrespect me.


<b>INT. DEBBIE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Debbie watches Pete fall to the ground. She opens the car
door and starts to run over toward him.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          Are you sure that's him? I don't
          think that's him.


<b>EXT. STREET- CONTINUOUS
</b>
As the man starts his engine, Debbie runs toward Pete.

<b>                    PETE
</b>              (in pain)
          I'm going to write down your
          license plate number.

The car drives away, revealing that it is new and has
dealer's plates with no numbers.

<b>                    PETE (CONT'D)
</b>          "Range Rover of Sunland."

Debbie reaches him and holds his head up.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          What are you doing?

<b>                      PETE
</b>          Ow.


<b>INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT
</b>
Debbie and Larry sit in the waiting area of the hospital.
<b>                                                140.
</b>

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          I guess the party didn't turn out
          like you planned.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          It wasn't a good party.

A NURSE walks over to them.

<b>                    NURSE
</b>          Hi. I'll bring you in as soon as
          his x-rays are finished.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Is he okay?

<b>                    NURSE
</b>          Yeah, he has a broken rib and he's
          been crying a little bit, but he'll
          be fine.

The Nurse walks away.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          You know Pete was never a real
          fighter. But that's why he married
          you. That's why he loves you.
          Because you're the fighter, and you
          need that. One person in a
          relationship has got to punch.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Do you mean that in a good way?

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          Oh, it's a high compliment.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Thanks.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          Listen, I know what you're worried
          about. You think he's going to turn
          into me, but I don't think it's
          going to happen. He's smarter and
          probably a little cuter. A little
          less Jewy. Although, after fifty,
          that's all going to change. Be
          prepared to wake up one day with a
          a rabbi. But the good news is,
          he'll love you forever. That's in
          our DNA. We stick around.
<b>                                                141.
</b>

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          He worries about you. It puts a lot
          of pressure on him.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          I know. I just don't have anyone
          else to talk to about it.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          You can talk to Claire.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          No. If I open up to her she'll
          leave me.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          No, she won't, Larry, she loves
          you.

<b>                     LARRY
</b>          I know, but there's a certain point
          at which you just can't stay.
              (beat)
          I guess it's hard to forgive
          somebody if they don't formally
          apologize to you.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Are you apologizing?

<b>                     LARRY
</b>          I'm very close.
              (beat)
          Yes, I'm sorry. And I'm glad
          everybody's okay.

<b>                     DEBBIE
</b>          Thanks.

She hugs him and starts to cry a little bit.

<b>                     LARRY
</b>          I'm off.

<b>                     DEBBIE
</b>          Okay.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          This is awkward.

<b>                     DEBBIE
</b>          What?
<b>                                                       142.
</b>

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          I need forty dollars for a cab.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>              (laughing)
          That's funny.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          No, I'm not kidding. You drove me.
          I wasn't prepared.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          I only have a hundred.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          That's okay. I'll bring you the
          change.

He grabs the bill out of her purse and walks off.

<b>                    LARRY (CONT'D)
</b>          All right, give him a kiss for me.


<b>INT. HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
Oliver is sitting on the couch with Charlotte and Sadie
watching the last scene of Lost. Joseph has joined them.

<b>                    OLIVER
</b>          I don't get it.

<b>                    SADIE
</b>          See, it's not sad, it's happy
          because they helped each other

<b>                     OLIVER
</b>          Oh.

<b>                    CHARLOTTE

<b>INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Debbie walks into Pete's room, sits on the bed next to him.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          I really liked our lives so much
          better before we tried to change

<b>                                      143.
</b>

<b>          PETE
</b>No. I'm sorry. I don't want to keep
anything from you. I love you.
You're my wife. I just didn't want
to let you down.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>Are you mad that I'm pregnant?

<b>          PETE
</b>No. I'm not mad. I'm thrilled.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>You don't feel trapped?

<b>          PETE
</b>Sometimes I feel like I trapped
you.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>I don't feel trapped.

<b>          PETE
</b>Really?

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>No.

<b>          PETE
</b>You should, because I've trapped
you. You can't go anywhere. I'm
going to get you pregnant every ten
years for the rest of your life.
You can never leave me. Ever.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>I never feel trapped by you. I'm so
happy to be with you. I love you so
much. You're my favorite person in
the whole world. god damn it, why
am I crying like this? Something is
wrong with me.

<b>          PETE
</b>You're pregnant.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>Oh, yeah. Shit. I was just outside
telling your dad that I liked him.
What if he thinks I like him now?

<b>          PETE
</b>No, he won't think that.
<b>                                      144.
</b>

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>I don't want him to think I like
him that much.

<b>          PETE
</b>It'll never happen.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>    (suddenly giddy)
Can you believe it? This is the
craziest thing ever. What are we
going to do with a third baby?

<b>           PETE
</b>I have no idea. How are we going to
afford it?

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>We'll sell the house.

<b>          PETE
</b>We don't have to.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>We kind of do.

<b>          PETE
</b>We kind of do.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>We'll make new memories in a new
house.

<b>          PETE
</b>I love you.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>Is there anything you want to do
for your birthday? It's been the
worst birthday ever.

<b>          PETE
</b>There is one thing, but I don't
think you'll like it.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>What?

<b>          PETE
</b>I wouldn't mind going to see some
music. Would you want to do that?

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>Yeah.
<b>                                                       145.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Really? I don't believe you, but
          you're sweet for saying that.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          How do we break you out of here?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          I can just leave on my own

          institution.

<b>                       DEBBIE

<b>                    PETE
</b>          It's not like One Flew Over the

</b>          Let's get out of here, McMurphy.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          You got it, Chief. Will you carry
          me?

As Debbie helps Pete off of the hospital bed, Pete kisses her
passionately.


<b>INT. SMALL NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
</b>
Pete and Debbie watch Ryan Adams perform "Lucky Now" with his
band.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          I like this song.

<b>                       PETE
</b>          Really?

<b>                       DEBBIE
</b>          Yeah. Why?

Pete smiles.

<b>                    DEBBIE (CONT'D)
</b>          Why don't you sign him?
<b>                                                         146.
</b>

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Ryan Adams? No, he wouldn't sign
          with me.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Why not? You're the best.

She smiles at him and he smiles back, almost blushing. This
is the smile he has been waiting for.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Well, he is in between labels.
          Let's go try and talk to him after
          the show.

The camera pulls back as Ryan Adams finishes his song.
