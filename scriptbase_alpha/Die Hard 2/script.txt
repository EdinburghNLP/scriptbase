          WHILE WE'RE IN BLACK we HEAR a PNEUMATIC "KA-CHUNK" and then

          1 EXT. DULLES TERMINAL - DAY 1

          JOHN MCCLANE, long topcoat FLAPPING, comes running out of the
          terminal towards an AIRPORT COP in plastic covered uniform who is
          supervising a TOW TRUCK DRIVER who in turn is manhandling a
          sedate sedan with Virginia plates and a "GRANDMOTHER ON BOARD"
          sign on the rear window.

                         MCCLANE

          BEEP drowns out his last word. McClave sweeps aside his coat,
          finds the beeper on his belt. He looks at the obviously
          unfamilar number on the read out in puzzlement, then runs into
          the terminal.

          CHRISTMAS MUSIC wafting through the building from a SCHOOL CHOIR
          perched in front of a massive, three-story window. Blase
          travelers PAUSE in their hectic rush to applaud the angelic
          voices.
          McClane shoves his way through some people - when they GLARE at
          him he quickly APPLAUDS the kids, pulls up at an INFORMATION
          BOOTH - the girl there is watching a LITTLE TV on the shelf out
          of sight from the public.

          Dropping his'wallet, McClane JUMPS aside as SHOTS WHIZZ PAST
          -McClane's COAT takes the BULLET HITS in MID AIR as he LANDS
          on a conveyor belt, which CARRIES him UP and OVER the gunmen.
          They FIRE UP at him - He aims.back - and then a SUITCASE falling
          from another belt and knocks his gun away!

                         44 BELOW 44
          The gun CLATTERS on the floor. Seeing it, the two men exchange a
          glance - split up.

                         45 MCCLANE 45
          Drops from the belt, crouches near big gears. Desperate, he
          looks around for a weapon, anything. Then he notices all the
          luggage going past: Suitcases, camera cases, a bicycle... Skis.

                         46 MILLER 46
          Moving forward expertly, gun ready. WHAP! A SKI POLE smacks
          down on his wrist! The gun DROPS onto a conveyor belt, FIRES -
          then moves away, obscured by moving luggage.

          towards Cochrane, who FIRES once more before McClane's KICK
          nearly toc e stf'his head - he loses the gun, but Jesus, these
          guys are tough and now Cochrane LEAPS UP and grabs McClane's
          belt and clothes and they're both hanging -suddenly they're both
          too damn high to get off!

          McClane PUNCHES Cochrane - again, again - but the guy's gonna
          kill them both one way or the other - McClane KICKS him, again,

          JUMPS to a thick conduit - and then Cochrane gets JAMMED

          Hey. Something serious happens every

          on TV, juggling knives and cha n
          i saws? That's what we're doing with
          those planes up there, only we do
          it one handed 'cause the other hand's
          playing 3 card monte with the planes
          on the ground.

                         (TO STUART)
          Sir, we just monitored a call from
          their chief engineer. Our people
          took out their Swat team...
          completely.

                         GARBER
          You were right... they went for the
          antenna array. We're right on
          schedule.

                         STUART
          Except losing our own team wasn't
          part of the plan.
          He comes to a decision. Picks up the phone. Speaks. Voice
          flat, firm, stern. Around and above him, his men hover over the
          improvised screens and terminals.

                         STUART
          Attention, Dulles. You were warned
          not to try and restore your systems.

          You've wasted lives and time on a
          futile and obvious target. Now you
          have to pay the penalty.

          has reacted to both the mention of his name and of McClane's.
          His brow furrows. Ah, yes.

          McClave? John McClane? The...
          policeman hero who saved the Nakatomi
          hostages? I read about you in People

          league on Nightline, though...

                         MCCLANE
          Yeah, Colonel. We were both famous
          for five minutes. Saw you get shit
          canned by Congress on TV. How much
          drug money is Esperanza paying you
          to turn traitor?

                         STUART
          I think Cardinal Richlieu said it
          best: Treason is merely a matter
          of dates. And this country has to
          learn it can't keep cutting the legs
          off men. like General Esperanza -men
          with the guts to stand up to Soviet
          agression.

                         MCCLANE
          And lesson one starts with killing

                         ESPERANZA
          Thank you for telling me, Eagle Nest.
          But if you could show it to me as
          well I would be grateful.
          In the church, Stuart grins at Esperanza's coo]., signals
          Thompson. A switch is THROWN.
          The FIRST RUNWAY goes OFF and a NEW RUNWAY lights up DIRECTLY IN
          FRONT of the plane.

          Wincing against the blowing snow and wind, the General expertly
          trims his descent. He reaches for a co-pilot's control and
          sweeps the dead man to the floor, bites down on his cigar. The
          plane begins to VIBRATE, but he humms to himself.
          He's the scum of the earth. But one hell of a pilot.

          He flies up the ladder - and BRUISES his shoulder against the

          Their BREATH clouding inside the still cold JEEP as it BOUNCES
          along. Garber shines a FLASHLIGHT into the falling snow,
          illuminates a snow-covered runway number sign: "EIGHT WEST."
          The miltary plane ROARS overhead!

                         210 THE TUNNEL 210
          BLAM! BLAM! McClane shoots off the lock apparatus of the grid!
          A RICOCHET PINGS off one of the grids hydraulic hinges and
          McClane winces as metal splinters sail by. Then he begins to
          muscle the heavy grid upwards.

                         211 UP ABOVE 211
          A FIELD of SNOW and ICE. But now a BLACK RECTANGLE EMERGES from
          it - it's the TUNNEL GRID, SNOW falling through it - the damn
          thing must weight over 300 pounds - McClane gets his head and
          shoulders up and out. Looks at -

          212 THE PLANE - HALF A MILE AWAY 212
          about to hit the runway -

          213 BACK TO SCENE 213
          McClane pushes upwards - grunts - when he shifts his grip his
          SKIN RIPS on the cold metal - with a grimace, he pushes his
          rifle out, starts to follow -

                         214 BELOW 214
          the damaged hydraulic hinge suddenly SNAPS with a squish of thick
          fluid.

                         215 ABOVE 215
          the 300 pound grid THUDS down on McClane's back. He GROANS,
          stunned.

                         216 THE PLANE 216
          SCREECHES down on the runway!

          D) THE PLANE - 1/8 mile away -
          E) MCCLANE'S FEET - still in the tunnel, they GROPE
          for leverage on the steps -and SLIP! Now they kick
          away at AIR -

          218 MCCLANE AND PLANE - IN ONE SHOT 218
          It's.coming, coming, COMING. Desperate, McClane sees that part
          of the rifle is half under the grid. Now, he puts all his energy
          into levering the rifle against the steel.
          Slowly, slowly, sweat breaking out on his forehead, he levers the
          rifle higher and higher, the rifle in turn levering the grid
          upward, an inch at a time finally, it's high enough for him to
          JAM the rifle's bayonet ring into the grid while the cheek notch
          of the stock perches precariously on the lip of the hole.

          AND THE PLANE IS RIGHT FUCKING THERE.
          McClane DIVES OUT OF THE HOLE.

                         219 NEW ANGLE 219
          McClane rolls away from the wheels, which miss him by inches.
          The PLANE SMACKS into the half-open grid, which goes FLYING, the
          plane hardly dented, the rifle SNAPPING like a toothpick, the
          scrambler CRUNCHING like a bug
          McClave kisses asphalt, WINCES at the SCORCH of jet exhaust five
          feet over his head.

                         220 THE PLANE 220
          Skids roughly to a stop a hundred yards away.
          McCl:ane:gets to his feet, sucks in air - and heads for the plane.

          NcClane 'DIVES and rolls into the cabin - FIRES TWICE out the door

          McClane SLAMS the door behind him, LOCKS IT. BULLETS PING into
          the door, which INDENTS from the hits which don't penetrate it.

          space with him... the SNOW and GLASS everywhere... and then he
          crawls to the door, gingerly tries it.
          IT WON'T MOVE. He tries harder.

          These are the old plans when the

          twelve years ago. And it looks like
          they did some modifications on site...
          moved Tracon, phone, ILS - all the
          underground stuff -so they could
          handle drainage. If I'm right, all
          of it would run along the edge of
          the airport property - and go right
          past this neighborhood.

          Baker yanks a combat knife from his boot and'DIVES on McClane
          -bo i HIT the wall of the church's detached garage -SNOW and
          ICE fall from the roof, but both men ignore it -
          McClane's LEFT hand can't force awaï¿½ akers RIGHT hand and
          the KNIFE.
          The bastard is STRONG and now his left jumps out and pins
          McClane's RIGHT so-it can't help-- The knife creeps towards
          McClane's throat! McClane is fucke -and then his desperate eyes
          look at something nearby -
          We FOCUS CHANGE - it's a big ICICLE -with his last strength
          McClane.BREAKS out of Baker's grip, grabs the icicle-
          -and STABS it RIGHT in Baker's EYE!

                         276 REVERSE ANGLE 276
          Baker SCREAMS and falls back - McClane ROLLS with him and with
          both hands PRESSES the ICICLE HOME SIX MORE INCHES right into the
          son-of-a-bitch's brain.
          The body TWITCHES, DIES. McClane falls against the garage as the
          snow turns CRIMSON all around. Catches his BREATH... and then
          REACTS to a WHISTLE.

          throws it away - heads for the door -

          433 MCCLANE -AT EDGE OF RUNWAY 433
          crawls to a painful sitting position. Face impassive, he watches
          the jet move away... and - incongrous as it seems - he lights a
          cigarette, looks off at - (X)

                         I

          434 THE LINE OF JET FUEL 434
          running along the runway for 1/4 mile now -

                         435 MCCLANE 435
           battered like a car wreck victim, now he looks up into the dark
           sky trying to find the SOUND OF JET ENGINES. Then he SEES -

          436 LIGHTS OF HOLLY'S PLANE - HIS POV 436
           careening down in a desperate fight, against gravity -

          RED-HOT.

          438 STUART - IN THE OPEN PLANE DOORWAY 438
          about to close it, he looks back and for the first time SEES

          439 THE JET FUEL - HIS POV 439
          winding endlessly down the runway -

                         440 MCCLANE 440

                          MCCLANE
           Hey, Colonel: Happy Fucking New Year.
           And he THROWS THE CIGARETTE INTO THE FUEL.

                         441 STUART 441
           SEES the flame RACING TOWARDS HIM - turns to SHOUT to Esperanza -

                          STUART

           NO! NO! TAKE OFF! TAKE OFF NOW! (X)

          But as the craft rises, so does the FLAME, climbing the fuel
          ribbon RIGHT INTO THE SKY and TO THE NEAREST ENGINE which

          EXPLODES!

          442C ESPERANZA 442C
          TURNS at the EXPLOSION in time for a WALL OF FIRE that SHOOTS UP
          THE WING and through the cockpit FLOOR, and then he's ON FIRE

                         AND THEN

                         443 STUART 443
           is BLOWN TO LITTLE PIECES as a FIREBALL BLOWS RIGHT OUT THE DOOR.,
           taking all the remaining soldiers with it and then

          444 THE PLANE - LONG SHOT 444
           It EXPLODES ITSELF, WINGS and TAIL and BODY going nine different
           directions!

          they watch the FIREBALL in the distance -

                         448 MCCLANE 448
          Gets to his knees, and LOOKS at the huge conflagration.

                         MCCLANE
          (towards the sky)
          Honey... there's your landing lights.

                         CUT TO:

          449 INT. HOLLY'S PLANE - COCKPIT 449

          Blackness and driven SNOW outside - and then - in an almost
          cinematic FADE - through the glass we SEE the BURNING WRECKAGE
          -and, more importantly - the LINE OF FIRE RUNNING CLEAN AND
          STRAIGHT for almost a mile -
          A line right along the runway.

                         CO-PILOT
          Look - !
          The pilot grabs controls desperately, trims the plane -

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         114

          450 IN THE CABIN - 450
           The passengers REACT as they level a bit -

                          CUT TO:

          451 EXT. HER PLANE 451

          It descends, a bit erratic, but now it's ALONGSIDE the line of
          fire, coming in from the wrong end of the runway, and then the
          wheels BOUNCE, once, twice, and then a tire BLOWS but the pilots (X)
          HOLD IT as it SWERVES and finally SKIDS TO A HALT, turning onto (X)
          the grassy field.
          Already we HEAR RESCUE SIRENS.

          452 IN THE CAB 452

                         BARNES
          (listening to headset)
          One forty is down! They used the
          fire to see -

                         (LAUGHING)
          I -they used the fucking fire to see!

                         AN ENGINEER
          They can all do that - let's tell

                         'EM -

                         TRUDEAU
          They already know. Listen.
          And sure enough, there it is - the SOUND of ENGINES -

          453 EXT. SKY - LANDING PATTERN 453

          And now the lights come down from the sky, in a neat and patient
          row, the closest-filling the screen, the others dwindling down to
          the size of stars.

          454 MCCLANE - ON THE RUNWAY 454
          Stumbles along, maybe thinking he's dead or dreaming... IGNORING
          the giant PLANE LANDING BESIDE HIM, ignoring the FLAMES beyond
          that - His concentration is totally on Holly's plane -now
          another giant PLANE SKIDS down behind him - it's an assembly
          line, like B-29's coming home from war - then he SEES what he's
          praying for - breaks into a RUN -

                         MCCLANE
          Holly - HOLLY -HOLLY!

          455 HOLLY - IN PLANE DOOR 455
          HEARS this just as she goes down the RESCUE CHUTE, ushed by
          Stewardess controlling their own tears -

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         115

                         (X)

          ('.. 456 MCCLANE 456
          CATCHES her at the bottom like a child - CARRIES HER AWAY.

          457 THORNBERG - ON THE GROUND 457
          groggy, he raises his hands in supplication to the stewardess.
          She steps over him, puts her high heels back on - walks off.

                         CUT TO:

          458 THE NEWS 'CHOPPER 458
          It CRUNCHES DOWN on the frozen earth near the runway. Sam and
          her cameraman hit the ground running. SEE -

          459 MCCLANE AND HOLLY 459
          embracing - and then she's nursing his wounds, hearing his story-

          460 BACK TO SCENE 460
          The cameraman brings up his lens.

                         CAMERAMAN
          God, that's beautiful -

                         SAM
          Yeah. It sure is.
          And she yanks out his power cord, watches it dreamily.

          461 THE AIRFIELD - NIGHT 461
          as rolling stairs are put up to the planes and the passengers
          pour down the steps into arms of friends, families, loved ones.

          461A MCCLANE 461A
          Sets Holly down, kisses her - then both TURN at a HONK.
          Marvin is there in an airport cart. He looks at the chaos.

                         MARVIN
          Damned if I'm cleaning up this mess.
          McClane and Holly get in the cart. Marvin drives them away,
          light BLINKING... and we PULLBACK until McClane and Holly are
          just part of the crowd.

                         THE END
