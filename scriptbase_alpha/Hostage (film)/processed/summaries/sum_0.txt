Jeff Talley, a former LAPD hostage negotiator, has moved himself away from his failed career outside of Los Angeles, and away from his wife and daughter.
When a convenience store robbery goes wrong in his turf, the three perpetrators move in on an unsuspecting family.
But the family's father has a secret which might compromise his kin, and one of the criminals is about to jump over the edge.
Jeff Talley has to get everybody to survive the night......if he can.
