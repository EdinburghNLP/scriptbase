Midnight Cowboy by Waldo Salt


FADE IN:

INT. TV STUDIO - DAY

A Susskind-type MODERATOR is speaking into camera:

               MODERATOR 
     Tonight we'll discuss a subject
     most of us seem to consider either
     bad taste or frivolous or funny.
     But if our experts are right, we
     face what might be called a
     masculinity crisis. Every fourth
     American man uptight, threatened by
     the increasing sexual demands of
     American women...

EXT. SIDEWALK INTERVIEW - DAY

An IRATE WOMAN speaks into camera:

               IRATE WOMAN
     They always put it that way, but
     well, all it means, you know, is
     every fourth American woman's never
     satisfied. That's it. I never am --
     have been, you know...

EXT. SIDEWALK INTERVIEW - DAY

A COOL WOMAN speaks into camera:

               COOL WOMAN
     This, this image of the, the man
     eating woman. It isn't our
     increasing demands. I think it's
     the shrinking American male...

EXT. SIDEWALK INTERVIEW - DAY

A SAD WOMAN speaks into camera:

               SAD WOMAN
     No, I never had, well, whatever it
     is you call it. But the hours he
     works, I can't blame him...

INT. CAFETERIA SCULLERY (TEXAS) - DAY

Full frame -- a scandal sheet picture of a sex-starved wife,
naked while her husband sleeps, captioned I BUY WHAT MY
HUSBAND CAN'T GIVE.

               SAD WOMAN'S VOICE 
     ... but it's a problem. A big
     problem. With so many women I
     know...

Camera pulls back to show the picture among other pinups of
women -- rich, beautiful or naked, but all blonde -- steam
wilted on the wall over a dishwashing machine. JOE BUCK grins
at the wall as he scrapes garbage.

               JOB 
     Just keep your pants on, ladies...

MULTIPLE SPLIT SCREEN

A LADY COMMENTATOR, gradually surrounded by lonely women...
     BEAUTY PARLOR               
     FASHION SHOW          
     PSYCHIATRIST'S COUCH       
     COCKTAIL BAR               
     GYMNASIUM                
     STATUE OF LIBERTY

               LADY COMMENTATOR
     Before World War One -- American
     men outnumbered women by over six
     percent. Today American women not
     only outnumber men, but live five
     years longer -- leaving them in
     control of vast corporate wealth
     and seventy-five percent of
     America's purchasing power...

The Lady Commentator is replaced by Joe, stacking dishes,
surrounded by frustrated ladies. He laughs tolerantly.

               JOE
     Y'all,line up and take your turn...

INT. TV STUDIO - DAY

The Moderator smiles into camera.

               MODERATOR 
     My question is this -- will
     American know-how come up with a
     marketable male to replace all the
     men who are worrying themselves
     into an early grave over women's
     increasing sexual demands?

INT. STALL SHOWER - DAY

Joe sings as he soaps himself, "Whoopee ti yi yo, git along
little dogies, for you know New York will be your new home!"
Sound and image freeze on Joe's open mouth.

SUPERIMPOSED MAIN TITLE AND CREDITS

TITLES follow as indicated, sound and action continuing after
each credit.

INT. SUNSHINE CAFETERIA - DAY

Joe's song continues over a sweating WAITRESS, glancing up.

               WAITRESS 
     Where's that Joe Buck?

INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Wrapped in a towel, singing in front of his dresser mirror,
Joe sprays himself with deodorant, aiming a last playful
blast at the unseen crotch -- freezing song and image as
CREDITS continue over...

... a calendar girl on the wall blushing orange, mouth frozen
in a tiny O, staring wide-eyed. Joe's song continues as...

... Joe rips the wrapping from a new Stetson and sets it on
his head, freezing song and image as CREDITS continue.

INT. CAFETERIA SCULLERY - DAY

RALPH, an aging black man, faces a mountain of dirty dishes.

               RALPH
     Where's that Joe Buck?

INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Singing as he buttons his new cowboy shirt, Joe interrupts
himself to answer Ralph...

               JOE
     Yeah, where's that Joe Buck?

... continuing his song as he pulls up and zips his tight
thighed black slacks, freezing song and image for CREDITS.

INT. REMEMBERED BEAUTY PARLOR - ANOTHER TIME

SALLY BUCK, a pretty middle-aged blonde, smiles down at
camera,

               SALLY BUCK
     You look real nice, Joe baby...

INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Joe sings as he pulls on his new cowboy boots, arranging his
cuffs to show off the yellow sunburst at the ankle, freezing
song and image for CREDITS.

INT. SUNSHINE CAFETERIA - DAY

The pink MANAGER scowls at his pocket watch.

               MANAGER 
     Where's that Joe Buck?

INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Joe hums as he piles a complete wardrobe of cowboy clothes,
still in their wrappers, into a shiny new suitcase of black
and white horsehide.

               JOE
     Yeah, where's that Joe Buck?

INT. SUNSHINE CAFETERIA - DAY

Holding his watch, the Manager wags a finger at camera.

               MANAGER 
     You're due here at four o'clock.
     Look at those dishes, look!

INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Joe laughs as he locks his suitcase.

               JOE
     Know what you can do with those
     dishes? And if you ain't man enough
     to do it yourself, I'd be happy to
     oblige...

Joe picks up his suitcase, a portable transistor radio, walks
away from the mirror, then pauses to run a comb through his
hair, hook a cigarette at the corner of his mouth and strike
a match on his thumbnail before he turns back for one
admiring glance at himself in the mirror -- proud, exultant,
ready -- freezing the image as CREDITS END.

EXT. TEXAS TOWN MAIN STREET - DAY

Joe leaves the hotel, carrying his suitcase.

INT. CAFETERIA SCULLERY - DAY

The pink Manager points at his watch angrily.

               MANAGER 
     Four to midnight, understand?

Angle widens to include Joe, holding his suitcase and radio.
Ralph stares at him curiously, stacking dishes.

               JOE
     Say, look, uh, I gotta have a word
     with you, if you got a second.

               MANAGER
     Later. Later maybe.

The Manager hurries away, carrying a basket of dishes.

               RALPH 
     You ain't coming to work?

               JOE
     Don't guess. Just come for my day's
     pay owing and to tell you I'm
     heading East.

Joe tilts his Stetson as the Waitress appears at the door...

               WAITRESS 
     Cups!

... but she disappears without noticing Joe. Ralph offers his
hand. Joe takes it, holds it.

               RALPH 
     What you gonna do back there, East?

               JOE 
     Lotta rich women back there...

               RALPH
     Yeah?

               JOE 
     Men, they mostly faggots.

               RALPH 
     Must be some mess back there.

               JOE 
     Well, ain't no use hanging around
     here.

               RALPH
     Ain't gonna collect your pay?

               JOE 
     I got me two hundred twenty-four
     bucks of flat folding money... 
            (slaps hip)
     He know what he can do with that
     chicken-shit day's pay. And if he
     ain't man enough to do it for
     himself, I be happy to oblige!

INT. SUNSHINE CAFETERIA - DAY

The door marked EMPLOYEES ONLY swings open and Joe appears,
measuring his effect on the customers and his fellow
employees as he crosses the sterile white dining room,
observing the drab details of the life he has left behind -
garbage on greasy dishes, limp food in steam table trays,
coffee-soaked cigarette butts, caked mustard and ketchup on
formica table tops -- two pimply high school girls slurping
suggestive noises after Joe through the straws of empty coke
glasses. O.S. a Tiomkin-tradition chorus sings, "From this
valley they say you are going -- we will miss your bright
eyes and sweet smile for they say you are taking the
sunshine..."

EXT. TOWN MAIN STREET - DAY

The song ends as Joe comes from the cafeteria "... that
brightened our pathway a while."

               JOE 
     Tough tiddy, ladies, you had your
     chance.

From a high angle -- Joe starts his long walk toward the bus
depot along the street of a small Western town struggling to
urbanize itself. The click-clack-click of his boots is loud
but somehow lonely The radio at his ear drones grain prices
on the Commodity change. Joe's pace slows as he passes...

EXT. SALLY BUCK'S BEAUTY SALON - DAY

... a gilt-lettered sign in the window, glittering in the
sun, momentarily hiding the fact that the shop is deserted.
Joe grins as he hears remembered sounds and voices incomplete
flashes, more significant in tone than content a girl
giggling sexily -- "Keep your meat hooks off my beauty
operators, sugar" -- tinkling noises of a busy beauty parlor 
- Sally Buck singing "Hush, little baby, don't say a word,
Grammaw gonna buy you a mockingbird..."

... a shift of light revealing a row of tarnished driers, a
broken mirror, a FOR RENT sign in the window. Joe turns
toward the bus depot, radio pressed to his ear.

               ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
     Benson and Hedges One Hundreds
     makes special awards from time to
     time for anything that's longer
     than anything...

               JOE 
     Care to get out your yardstick,
     gentlemen?

At the same moment, a recognizable variant of the "Big
Country" theme blares loud.

INTERCUT WESTERN FILM CLIP

Gary Cooper (or John Wayne) walks a frontier street.

EXT. BUS DEPOT - DAY

High angle of the departing bus, intercut "Big Country"
fashion, alternating high shots with close-ups of the bus
wheals.

EXT. FREEWAY CLOVERLEAF - DAY

Through the bus windshield -- a dizzying montage of traffic
lines, arrows and signs as the bus sweeps around and up onto
the freeway.

INT. BUS - DAY

Joe sits at the front, opposite the driver, cracking his gum
as he watches the huge billboards streaking by, promising him
power, happiness and beautiful women if he chooses the right
breakfast food, hair oil or automobile. Joe listens to the
humming tires, the roar of the engine, shaking his head.

               JOE
     This is a powerful mothah, ain't
     it?

Ignored by the driver, Joe rises and walks back to his empty
double seat, glancing around to see what impression he's made
on his immediate fellow travelers -- an OLD LADY in front of
him -- a hostile young sailor with acne behind him -- two
teeny-boppers flirting with Joe hysterically -- a PALE BLONDE
directly across the aisle, smiling at Joe weakly.

               PALE BLONDE 
     Do you have a stick of gum?

Joe leans across, snapping his gum as he offers her a stick.
He watches her nibble it daintily on her front teeth.

               PALE BLONDE (CONT'D)
     Thank you.

               JOE 
     Plenty more where that came from.

               PALE BLONDE 
     Thank you, no, it's just till the
     Dramamine works. I get carsick.

               JOE 
     I only get carsick on boats. 
            (waits, then)
     But seems to me that's more the
     fish smell than the bouncing...

Joe realizes that her eyes are closed. Mildly depressed, he
stretches himself across both seats and turns on his radio,
finds only static and snaps it off. Further depressed, he
examines his reflection in the bus window, squeezes a black
head and runs the comb through his hair, picks a piece of
tobacco off his tooth and lights a cigarette, watching the
flame die in reflection, forgetting to discard the burnt-out
match as he stares out at a vast lonely prairie, a solitary
cowboy in the distance, a row of sharecropper shacks
apparently deserted, a barefoot little girl motionless at the
roadside, watching the bus pass. Through this, leading into
the next scene, Sally Buck sings softly "... if that mocking
bird don't sing, Grammaw gonna buy you a golden ring..."

INT. REMEMBERED BEAUTY SALON - ANOTHER TIME

Sally Buck, relaxing in the middle of a busy day, eyes closed
wearily, while little Joe massages her neck. Her song
continues over the noises of the busy beauty parlor "... if
that golden ring turns brass, Grammaw gonna buy you a looking
glass..."

               SALLY BUCK
     No, a little lower, sugar, yeah,
     yeah, that's good. Grammaw's beat.

               SALESMAN'S VOICE 
     You gotta sell yourself, that's the
     whole trick...

INT. BUS - DAY

A seedy TRAVELING SALESMAN with badly-fitted dentures and a
frayed collar has taken the aisle seat next to Joe. As he
lectures Joe on salesmanship, he figures his expenses in a
worn leatherette notebook, nervous fingers and eyes
unconsciously revealing the extent of his failure.

               SALESMAN 
     It ain't the product and it ain't
     the price, no sir, and it ain't
     what you sell, it's personality,
     pure and simple. I ain't shined my
     own shoes or shaved my own face in
     forty years, how's that? Not bad
     for a kid that didn't pass the
     eighth grade, right?

               JOE 
     Yeah, hell, yeah.

               SALESMAN
     And that's my golden rule. Make 'em
     love you. Put yourself over and you
     can sell them anything. If they
     like you, they'll buy horsemeat for
     prime beef...

INT. REMEMBERED BEAUTY SALON - ANOTHER TIME

A gawky, adolescent Joe sits sprawled on the couch, leafing
through a magazine while Sally Buck bleaches the roots of a
young woman's hair.

               SALLY BUCK 
     You get him to the church, honey.
     He ain't gonna find out you ain't a
     real blonde till after you're
     married, then's too late.

Sally Buck turns, pretending to be stern as Toe laughs.

               SALLY BUCK (CONT'D)
     You getting too big for your
     britches, sugar.

EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

The headlights of the bus flash past a huge sign, painted on
the slant roof of a barn: JESUS SAVES.

INT. BUS - NIGHT

Joe is alone again. The Salesman has disappeared. The bus is
dark, most-passengers trying to sleep. Only one reading light
still burns, over the head of the old-Lady in the seat ahead
of Joe. Joe squirms, restless, trying to lull himself to
sleep with the music of a revivalist gospel group on the
radio.

               SALLY BUCK'S VOICE 
     Don't forget to say your prayers,
     honey...

Joe leans forward to help the old Lady, irritably struggling
with the release button on her seat. She scowls as Joe leans
over to release her seat, then pulls her blanket around her
and turns away from him. Joe switches off her reading light.

               OLD LADY 
     I want it on.

Joe switches it on again, fakes a good-natured grin, settles
back with his radio, aware of an OLD COWHAND seated opposite
him, replacing the Pale Blonde. The Old Cowhand is appraising
Joe's wardrobe curiously. He looks away when he sees Joe
watching him. Joe settles back, unable to think of a way to
open a conversation.

               EVANGELIST'S VOICE
     Oh, my friends, I say unto you,
     invest with Jesus, put your dollars
     to work where they'll pay off at
     compound interest. The Good Book
     says money answereth all things...

The Old Cowhand has rolled-himself a cigarette. Joe quickly
lights a match on his thumb and holds it across the aisle.

               JOE 
     Light?

The Old Cowhand's "thanks" is lost in a fit of coughing as he
inhales his first drag. He settles back, wiping his watery
eyes on a faded bandana.

               EVANGELIST'S VOICE 
     ... everyone who sends a dollar to
     the Evangelical Congregation of the
     Air will get free gratis a genuine
     leatherette hymn book so you can
     sing along with Sister Rosella and
     the Evangelical Choir...

               JOE
     You throw in Sister Rosella and you
     got a deal, right, old timer?

Joe glances across the aisle. The Old Cowhand manages a
faint, humorless smile.

               JOE (CONT'D)
     Going far?

               OLD COWHAND 
     Up the line. Not far.

               JOE
     I'm bound for New York City.

The Old Cowhand reappraises Joe's wardrobe even more
curiously.

               JOE (CONT'D)
     Ever happen to come across a cowman
     name of Woodsy Niles? Friend of my
     grammaw Sally Buck...

The Old Cowhand considers, shakes his head. Joe leans back,
laughing to himself.

INT. REMEMBERED BEDROOM - ANOTHER TIME

Little Joe's head is lost in a beat-up cowboy hat, similar to
the one worn by the old Cowhand. Sally Buck smiles on WOODSY
NILES -- a long-legged cowboy with a shock of black hair --
who stands at her dressing table, admiring himself in a new
Stetson.

               SALLY BUCK 
     Like it, honey? Does it fit?

               WOODSY 
     You do me good, Sal, you do me real
     good. You know what I gonna give
     you for that Stetson?

Woodsy grabs Sally Buck, lifting her off her feet, carrying
her to the bed. Struggling, they fall across the covers
together, Little Joe laughing with them.

               SALLY BUCK 
     Woodsy Niles! The boy!

               WOODSY 
     He don't know what makes little
     apples by now, it's time he found
     out.

INT. BUS - NIGHT

Joe shakes his head, grinning, offering the old Cowhand a
cigarette.

               JOE
     Smoke?

The old Cowhand shakes his head, showing the rolled cigarette
Joe lit for him. Joe nods, still bemused.

INT. REMEMBERED BEDROOM - ANOTHER TIME

Little Joe is cuddled in Sally Buck's arms, under the covers,
watching Woodsy, sitting cross-legged on the bed, naked
except for his Stetson and guitar, singing drunkenly.

               WOODSY
     ... git along little dogies!

EXT. MIDWEST TOWN - MORNING

From a high angle -- the bus slows to a stop.

INT. BUS - MORNING

Joe awakens, stiff-necked, momentarily confused. He
straightens in his seat as he sees the old Cowhand lifting a
sweat-stained saddle down from the overhead rack, starting
toward the front of the bus. Joe calls after him.

               JOE
     Nice talking to you, old timer.

Joe stuffs a stick of gum in his mouth, turns to wave at the
Old Cowhand through the window as the bus pulls away.

               WOODSY'S VOICE
     She-dogs squat, boy. He-dogs stand
     up and lift their leg...

INT. REMEMBERED MEN'S ROOM - ANOTHER TIME

Woodsy, in his new Stetson, watches Little Joe in his beat-up
cowboy hat, trying to balance on one foot, one leg lifted in
front of the trough. Woodsy roars with laughter.

               WOODSY 
     ... but he-men stand and shoot from
     the hip.

INT. BUS RESTROOM - DAY

Joe laughs, flushes, checks his hair in the mirror.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The bus streaks past a brightly-colored billboard -- IN NEW
YORK, A WELCOME AWAITS YOU AT THE TIMES SQUARE PALACE HOTEL!

INT. BUS - DAY

Joe is now sitting in the wide rear seat, between two young
MARINES and a group of VETERANS wearing campaign caps and
convention buttons, passing a bottle, singing "From the Balls
of Montezuma to the Shores of Tripoli..." Joe follows the
conversation between a VETERAN and a MARINE, participating
only because he's sitting beside them, adopting a remembered
military stance.

               VETERAN
     Ever stationed at Kennedy? Those
     Florida chicks...

               MARINE 
     Instant V-goddam-D.

               VETERAN 
     This Pensacola teeny-bopper -- jail
     bait -- but built? Ten bucks she
     wanted. Three of us made a deal
     for, twenty-five, see, big goddam
     bargain?

               MARINE 
     Big peni-goddam-cillin bargain,
     right?

               VETERAN 
     You got it.

               MARINE 
     No. You got it.

               JOE 
     Jesus goddam Christ, I ain't
     laughed so hard since I was out at
     Fort Benning, Georgia.

               MARINE
     Did you make the Viet?

               JOE 
     What? Oh, hell no. Motor pool
     mostly...
            (shakes his head)
     Kee-rist...

INT. REMEMBERED WHOREHOUSE - ANOTEER TIME

A plump, aging PROSTITUTE laughs up into camera.

               PROSTITUTE 
     Hey, hey, what you try to do to me?
     You gonna cost me money, soldier!

INT. BUS - DAY

Joe laughs as he passes the bottle, trying to sing along
without knowing the words as the Veterans segue into "Over
hill, over dale, we will hit the dusty trail, as the caissons
go rolling along..."

INT. REMEMBERED BEAUTY SALON - ANOTHER TIME

Sally Buck fondly wipes lipstick from Joe's lips.

               SALLY BUCK
     Keep your meat hooks off my
     operators, sugar, hear?

INT. BUS - DAY

Joe slaps one of the Veterans on the back, trying to follow
the song into "Off we go, into the wild blue yonder..."

INT. REMEMBERED MOVIE HOUSE - ANOTHER TIME

ANASTASIA clutches a younger Joe, eyes wild, gasping.

               ANASTASIA 
     You're the only one, Joe, the only,
     only one ever!

INT. BUS - DAY

Joe is leaning across the two Marines, staring out of the
window as the Veterans switch to "Anchors aweigh, my boys,
anchors aweigh..."

EXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE - DAY

A stunning view through the bus window past Joe's reflection.

               JOE'S REFLECTION 
     Gonna swing my lasso and rope that
     whole goddam island, yeah!

EXT. BROADWAY PARADE - DAY

Drum majorettes leading the parade -- ticker tape and
confetti -- girls at skyscraper windows.

INTERCUT NEWSREEL CLIP

Charles Lindberg (or James Stewart) waving at the crowd.

EXT. NEW YORK HARBOR - DAY

Girls lining the piers -- flags, banners, bunting -- ship
horns, whistles, bells.

INT. BUS - DAY

Joe crowded as the veterans prepare to leave the bus, lifting
down banners and flags.

EXT. LINCOLN TUNNEEL - DAY

The bus suddenly surrounded by converging traffic, horns
honking, segueing into the noises of Times Square.

EXT. MARQUEE - DAY

Flag draped, reading: WELCOME VETERANS.

EXT. STREET - BANNER - DAY

Flapping in the wind -- WELCOME VETERANS!

EXT. TIMES SQUARE PALACE HOTEL - DAY

The marquee announces TRANSIENTS WELCOME. O.S. a singing
radio station break blares "W-I-N-S NEW YORK..."

EXT. RADIO TOWER - DAY

The sign flashes WINS "... ten-ten on your dial!" A torchy
woman's voice sings from a lonely echo chamber -- introducing
a love theme which will haunt Joe throughout the film.

INT. ROOM 1014 - DAY

Joe sets his radio on the dresser, his suitcase on the bed,
then turns to examine his new home -- as anonymous as his
Texas hotel room -- but boasting a coin-operated television
set. Fascinated, Joe inserts a quarter.

... the love song continues over a television talk Show
featuring a POODLE WIGMAKER defending his profession against
a Joe Pyne-type PANEL HOST, "...well, I perform a real
service, there's a need, so many people, you know, really
live in their pets, I mean, lonely, I grant you, but their
feeling is real. They want to lavish as much love, give them
as much, yes, pamper them like they were really human
children or whatever..."

               SALLY BUCK'S VOICE 
     There's a TV dinner in the fridge,
     lover boy...

INT. REMEMBERED PARLOR - ANOTHER TIME

Little Joe stares sullenly at an antique TV box while Sally
Buck puts her hat on at the fireplace mirror. There is a
framed picture of Woodsy Niles on the mantle.

               SALLY BUCK 
     You be okay, won't you? Maybe I
     bring you a treat if you're a good
     boy...

INT. ROOM 1014 - DAY

Joe watches the Panel Host, "... you're a nut case, fella, a
real nut case..."

INT. REMEMBERED BEAUTY SALON - ANOTHER TIME

Little Joe massaging Sally Buck's neck -- continuing the
earlier scene.

               SALLY BUCK 
     I'm so beat, no point you waiting
     round, toots, think I'll stop in
     for a beer or two...

INT. ROOM 1014 - DAY

Joe sits on the edge of the bed, watching the poodles primp.

INT. REMEMBERED PARLOR - ANOTEER TIME

Little Joe stares unblinking at the TV screen as Sally Buck
kisses him on the forehead, dressed for the street.

               SALLY BUCK 
     Expect me when you see me. Looks
     like I got me a new beau, lover
     boy, how's that for an old grammaw?
     I'll leave you movie money...

Sally Buck tucks a dollar bill under a framed picture of
Jesus, who has replaced Woodsy Niles on the mantle.

INT. ROOM 1014 - DAY

As a fairy godmother's magic wand removes sticky hair spray
from a pretty model's head, Joe's quarter runs out and the
screen goes blank. At the same moment, the love song is cut
off by a singing station break "W-I-N-S NEW YORK" Joe rises,
flipping the dial of the radio to a cultured woman's voice
reading "...the Dow Jones averages, brought you by Morgan
Vandercook. Up your income with sound investment
counseling..."

               JOE 
     Up yours, lady.

... but Joe leaves the lady on, savoring the expensive sound
of her voice reading the stock quotations. Joe seats himself
at the desk, pleased to find a postcard photograph of the
hotel. He picks up a ballpoint pen, counts ten floors up from
the street and marks a huge X -- THIS IS ME, then turns the
card over, pen poised over the address blank.

INT. CAFETERIA SCULLERY - DAY

Ralph stares at the card, surrounded by dirty dishes.

               RALPH
     Hell, he know I can't read...

INT. ROOM 1014 - DAY

Joe's pen wavers, starts to write and stops.

EXT. SALLY BUCK'S BEAUTY PARLOR - DAY

As we saw it last, deserted, a FOR RENT sign in the window.
Joe's reflection appears, staring at himself, dressed in his
dishwasher's clothes.

               JOE'S VOICE 
     After all them dishes are washed,
     what?

               JOE'S REFLECTION 
     Then they bring some more dishes
     and I wash them and then I, uh,
     sleep some and then wash some more
     dishes and then I...

               JOE'S VOICE
     Say it, lover boy!

               JOE'S REFLECTION 
     Die.

INT. ROOM 1014 - DAY

Joe stares at the postcard, bemused,

               JOE'S VOICE
     Well, you better just shake your
     tail, lover boy, and root, hog or
     die.

Joe rises abruptly, rips up the postcard and tosses it out
the window.

               JOE
     Goddam if I came to this town to
     write postcards.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAY

The torn fragments flutter down on the crowd -- a woman
brushing irritably at her hair -- a man grimacing, glancing
up -- a cop removing his hat to examine it.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE PALACE HOTEL - DAY

From a low angle -- identical with the postcard photograph --
an unseen hand scrawls a huge X--- THIS IS ME. Camera zooms
up to a close-up of Joe at the window.

EXT. FIFTH AVENUE - DAY

From on high -- as though Joe were watching himself -- the
Stetson moves through a crowd of Fifth Avenue shoppers...

EXT. GLASS BUILDING - DAY

... passing a glass bank, lady tellers counting money...

EXT. CAR SHOWROOM - DAY

... passing a display of imported luxury cars...

EXT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY

... passing a window which features a single gem -- pausing
as horns blast O.S. and a mod blonde in a stalled sports car
motions to Joe -- she needs a push. Joe grins, glances at
himself in the window, runs a comb through his hair, then
turns back to see a cop helping the mod blonde. 

EXT. PARK AVENUE - DAY

Joe's heels drag as he walks a deserted block of luxury
apartment houses. O.S. The torchy woman's voice sings Joe's
love theme in counterpoint to the blasting horns, a siren, a
fire bell, a screech of brakes. Joe's spirits rise as he
hears the tic-tac-tic of high heels overtaking the heavy
click-clack-click of his boots. He adjusts his pace to arrive
at the corner at the same time as a smart and -- in Joe's
eyes -- very RICH LADY. Joe grins boyishly, holding his
Stetson over his heart.

               JOE
     Beg pardon, ma'am, I'm new here in
     town, just in from Houston, Texas,
     and looking for the Statue of
     Liberty.

The delicate profile gives no signs of hearing. Joe follows
her to the parkway in the middle of the avenue. There she
stops and turns, neither friendly nor hostile. 

               RICH LADY
     Were you looking? About the Statue
     of Liberty?

               JOE 
     Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean
     business!

               RICH LADY 
     I'm sorry. I thought you were --
     never mind -- I've never actually
     been there, but let me see, you
     take the Seventh Avenue subway, I
     think, to the end of the line...

               JOE 
     You sure are a pretty lady.

The Rich Lady tries to frown, taken aback, blushing.

               RICH LADY
     You're not looking for the Statue
     of Liberty at all.

               JOE 
     No, ma'am, I'm not.

               RICH LADY
     Why, that's perfectly dreadful.
     Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

A twinkle of amusement and sympathy reveals the age lines at
the corner of her eyes. Then she continues on quickly, just
as the light turns. Joe's view is blocked for a moment by
traffic, then he sees...

... the Rich Lady, newly aware of her flanks as she climbs
the steps of a brownstone and searches for her key. Still
from Joe's viewpoint, he sees himself move into frame and
follow the Rich Lady up the steps. The love theme swells O.S.
as the Rich Lady leads him into the house and closes the
door...

... leaving Joe standing alone on the parkway island,
surrounded by towering wealth. The love theme continues
over...

EXT. LEXINGTON AVENUE - DAY

... a pair of high-heeled pink slippers, walking a miniature
poodle -- slowing slightly, reacting to Joe's cowboy boots as
they pass, pause and turn back.

               CASS'S VOICE 
     Hurry up, Baby. Do um goody-goods
     for Mama.

Joe grins, holding his hat over his heart as he approaches
CASS TREHUNE, a blonde lady in a tight black dress, with the
look of a movie star who wrecked her career with food.

               JOE 
     Beg pardon, ma'am. I'm brand
     spanking new to this town, come 
     from Houston, Texas, and hoping to
     get a look at the Statue of
     Liberty...

               CASS 
     You're hoping to get a look at
     what?

               JOE 
     The Statue of Liberty.

               CASS 
     It's up in Central Park, taking a
     leak. If you hurry, you'll make the
     supper show. Now get lost.

But as she turns, Cass winks, dimpling the corners of her
mouth, signaling Joe to follow her.

INT. APARTMENT HOUSE ELEVATOR - DAY

Cass holds the DOOR OPEN button till Joe enters the elevator,
then the doors close with a soft expensive little kllooosh
and Cass turns with the smile of a very tiny girl...

               CASS 
     Hi.

... her lips closing on Joe's as the poodle yaps shrilly at
their feet. Superimposed, almost subliminally, a golden
dollar sign appears, halating like a star, and the bell of a
pinball machine rings O.S.

INT. CASS'S APARTMENT - DAY

A princess telephone is ringing on a gold and white desk.
Cass runs to grab it...

               CASS 
     Hello?

... as Joe steps from the elevator, which opens directly onto
Cass's penthouse. Cass beckons him toward her, hooks a finger
into his neckerchief and pulls his mouth toward hers while
she talks on the phone.

               CASS (CONT'D)
     Morey? Hi-ee, honey...

Cass gurgles happily as her free hand unbuckles Joe's
garrison belt.

               CASS (CONT'D)
     I'm just out of breath, honey,
     running to catch the phone.

As her fingers reach for Joe's zipper, cut to...

... Joe's hand unzipping her dress.

               CASS (CONT'D)
     I was walking Baby. Him got to do
     him goody-goods, right?

The poodle tugs at Joe's slacks until they fall. Cass steers
her ear to Joe's mouth, shuddering deliciously.

               CASS (CONT'D)
     Oh God, oh stop. I can't stand
     that. I just die...
            (quickly into phone)
     It's Baby, Morey. Him trying to say
     hello. Say hello to Morey, Baby.

Cass holds the phone toward the yapping poodle, twisting
herself against Joe as she wriggles out of her dress, passing
the phone from one hand to the other.

               CASS (CONT'D)
     Okay, old goosie? Now lookie, when
     do you want me to meet you?
     Whatever you say. I'll take a nap,
     watch TV, you know, kill time.
     Okay, but just one, a big wet one.

Cass hangs up. The poodle yaps hysterically, disentangling
himself from her tumbling dress -- hops onto the couch 
glances off and flees again as an overturned lamp crashes
O.S.

INT. CASS'S BEDROOM - DAY

The poodle bounces onto the bed -- remaining long enough to
establish a TV REMOTE CONTROL TUNER lying on the satin
coverlet -- then leaps down in panic as he hears Joe and Cass
explode into the bedroom, laughing lustily...

... the remote control tuner buried suddenly under the full
flesh of Cass's hip, activating...

... a twenty-five-inch television screen, blasting at full
volume...

... Cass's eyes widening, profoundly impressed...

               CASS 
     Ye gods...

... the images and sound of the television set flicking
joyfully from channel to channel...

... Joe laughing, engulfed by Cass's abundance...

... Cass wild-eyed, overflowing the frame...

... a gleaming slot machine -- three Sahara cowgirls clicking
into line for jackpot -- silver dollars overflowing the
frame...

EXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE - DAY

... the Mutual of New York tower flashes MONY!

               JOE'S VOICE 
     Holy shee-it, this is a goddam
     penthouse you got here, Cass, a
     real goddam penthouse.

INT. CASS'S BEDROOM - DAY

Joe turns away from a small terrace, buckling his belt,
glancing off toward the sound of Cass in the shower. He
flicks the TV remote control, enjoying his power, ignoring
the silent images on the screen -- battle casualties, a
pretty girl recommending aspirin, a man's stomach flashing
animated pain, starving war refugees, a dog eating pzazz --
flicking it off to concentrate on the costume jewelry and
perfume bottles on Cass's dressing table.

               CASS'S VOICE
     Don't look, baby...

Joe turns to look as Cass comes from the bathroom, holding a
towel around her as she runs behind the closet door.

               JOE 
     Say, Cass, I, uh, sure have enjoyed
     being here. Believe it's as fine a
     time as I've had in my life!

               CASS'S VOICE 
     Me, too, lover.

               JOE
     That's good, it is, cause, well I
     guess I didn't tell you why I came
     to New York, did I?

A tower of black bugle beads emerges from the closet door.

               CASS
     Zip this thing, will you, Tex?

Joe zips her dress, follows her to the dressing table, where
she sprays her hair with lacquer.

               JOB 
     Truth is, Cass, I'm, well, I'm in
     business.

               CASS 
     Oh, poor you. Morey's got terrible
     ulcers.

Cass stretches her upper lip across her teeth and she smears
it with, orange lipstick.

               JOE 
     Don't know what line Morey's in,
     but myself now, fact is -- I'm a
     hustler.

               CASS 
            (lips stretched)
     Hers'n zodda meg a livig.

               JOE 
     Beg pardon, ma'am?

               CASS 
     Said, a person's gotta make a
     living.

               JOE 
     You sure you heard what I said?

               CASS 
     Scuse me, hon, fraid I'm only half
     here. Maybe you oughta run on
     along. But why don't you take this
     phone number?

Joe grins, relieved as she takes out a gold lame purse and
opens it. He frowns as she folds; it upside down, empty.

               CASS (CONT'D)
     Darn! I didn't get to the bank --
     Tex -- could you let me have a
     little coin for the taxi-waxi?

Joe stands mute as she cups his chin in her hand,
seductively.

               CASS (CONT'D)
     You're such a doll. I hate money,
     don't you? God, it's been fun.

               JOE 
     Funny thing, you mentioning money.
     I was just about to ask your for
     some...

Joe tries to laugh but it sticks in his throat as Cass speaks
-- an impassioned whisper -- still holding Joe's chin.

               CASS 
     You bastard! You son of a bitch!
     You think you're dealing with some
     old slut? Look at me! You think
     just cause you're a longhorn bull
     you can get away with this crap?
     Well, you're out of your mind. I am
     a gorgeous chick, thirty-one,
     that's right, you said it!

Sobbing suddenly, she throws herself on the bed. Joe stands
bewildered by the vastness of her grief.

               JOE 
     Hey. Hey, Cass. Did you think I
     meant that? Christ, would I be
     asking you for money with a wad
     like that riding on my hip?

Joe waves his wallet at her, but she only cries louder. He
hands her a kleenex. She clutches it to her face, wailing.
Joe leans over the bed, whispering in her ear:

               JOE (CONT'D)
     Hey. You are a gorgeous-looking
     piece, Cass. Guy gets horny, just
     looking at you. It's a fact. How
     much you need for that taxi? Ten?
     Twenty? There you go.

Joe tucks a twenty-dollar bill into her bosom, tilts his
Stetson and starts out. Cass blows her nose, looking after
him. O.S. chorus sings, "From this valley they say you are
going -- we will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile..."

EXT. LEXINGTON AVENUE - DAY

From a high angle, Joe walks away from the apartment house,
chorus continuing O.S. "... they say you are taking the
sunshine that brightened our pathway a while."

INT. EVERETT'S BAR - DAY

Joe sits at the bar, staring morosely at his image in the
mirror, already quite drunk, oblivious to the assorted types
hiding from daylight in the barn-like saloon, waiting for
night to fall.

               RATSO'S VOICE 
     Excuse me, I'm just admiring that
     colossal shirt...

RATSO studies Joe across the corner of the bar -- a sickly,
child-size old man of twenty-one -- hopefully nursing an
empty beer glass, contemplating the money on the bar in front
of Joe.

               RATSO 
     That is one hell of a shirt. I bet
     you paid a pretty price for it, am
     I right?

               JOE 
     Oh, it ain't cheap. I mean, yeah,
     I'd say this was an all right
     shirt. Don't like to, uh, you know,
     have a lot of cheap stuff on my
     back.

Ratso spits as JACKIE leans on the bar next to Joe -- a
feminine young person, heavily made-up, hair teased, wearing
earrings and a lace-trimmed blouse over shocking pink  levis.

               JACKIE 
     Got a cigarette, cowboy?

               RATSO
            (a stage whisper)
     More goddam faggots in this town.

Reaching for a cigarette, Joe glances at Jackie, startled as
Jackie twitches his pink levis angrily and turns away.

               JOE
     Shee-it...
            (shakes his head)
     Kee-rist, you really know the
     ropes. Wish to hell I bumped into
     you before. I'm Joe Buck from Texas
     and I'm gonna buy you a drink, what
     do you say to that?

               RATSO 
     Enrico Rizzo from the Bronx. Don't
     mind if I do.

               JOE
            (slaps bar)
     Same all around! For my friend,
     too!

The TV screen over the bar features a mating game program as
Jackie cruises down to join a tall farm boy with plucked
eyebrows. The TV HOST points to three young men, visible only
from the shoulders up, from whom a pretty DATE GIRL in
blindfold must choose an escort.

               TV HOST 
     ... and for the losers, who don't
     get the girl, we'll give as
     consolation prices -- a six month
     supply of underarm deodorant...

In a booth now -- the TV screen in the background, continuing
the game -- Joe is refilling Ratso's beer glass as he speaks,
loud over the laughter of the TV audience.

               JOE 
     ... you see what I'm getting at
     here? She got a penthouse up there
     with color TV and more goddam
     diamonds than an archbishop and she
     busts out bawling when I ask for
     money!

               RATSO 
     For what?

               JOE 
     For money.

               RATSO 
     For money for what?

               JOE 
     I'm a hustler, hell, didn't you
     know that?

               RATSO 
     How would I know? You gotta tell a
     person these things 
            (shakes his head)
     A hustler? Picking up trade on the
     street like that -- baby, believe
     me -- you need management.

               JOE 
     I think you just put your finger on
     it, I do.

               RATSO 
     My friend O'Daniel. That's who you
     need. Operates the biggest stable
     in town. In the whole goddam
     metropolitan area. A stud like you 
     - paying! -- not that I blame you --
     a dame starts crying, I cut my
     heart for her...

               JACKIE'S VOICE 
     I'd call that a very minor
     operation...

Ratso grabs the neck of a bottle, sliding back in the booth.
Joe scowls as Jackie appears with the tall farm boy.

               JACKIE 
     ... in fact, you just sit comfy and
     I'll cut it out with my fingernail
     file. You won't even need Blue
     Cross, Ratso.

               RATSO 
     The name is Rizzo.

               JACKIE 
     That's what I said, Ratso.

               JOE 
            (suddenly)
     Hey now, you heard him.

On the TV screen -- the Date Girl announces:

               TV DATE GIRL 
     I pick Number Two! He's cool!

               RATSO 
     That's okay, Joe. I'm used to these
     types that like to pick on
     cripples. Sewers're full of 'em.

               JACKIE
     May I ask one thing, cowboy? If you
     sit there and he sits way over
     there, how's he gonna get his hand
     into your pocket? But I'm sure he
     has that all figured out...
            (to Ratso)
     Good night, sweets.

               TV HOST
     May present your chosen mate!

The TV host pulls aside the screen which has concealed the
lower half of the three young men. Number Two, her chosen
mate, is a dwarf sitting on a high stool. The girl's
spontaneous dismay starts everyone laughing hysterically,
including the dwarf.

EXT. SIXTH AVENUE - DAY

Joe has difficulty keening up with Ratso, who swings himself
along with surprising agility, his half skipping little gate
favoring one game leg.

               RATSO 
     Look, with these chicks that want
     to buy it, most of 'em are older,
     dignified, right? Social register
     types. They can't be trotting down
     to Times Square to pick out the
     merchandise. They need a middleman,
     right? That's O'Daniel.

Joe hesitates as Ratso darts into traffic against a red
light, yelling unheard obscenities at a cab driver who blasts
his horn. Joe runs recklessly forward as Ratso slams the taxi
fender with his fist, pretending to be hit, falling into
Joe's arms. The taxi stops, halting traffic. Ratso, recovers,
strolls casually in front of the cab, biting his thumb at the
driver.

               RATSO (CONT'D)
     It is a crime, a stud like you
     passing out double sawbucks to a
     chick like that. With proper
     management you should be taking
     home fifty, a hundred bucks a day.
     More if you wanta moonlight...

EXT. SIDEWALK CAFE - COCKTAIL HOUR

At,the corner of Central Park South, Ratso points toward a
young man with diamond cuff-links, sitting with a blue-haired
matron who puffs on a small cigar. Ratso waves jauntily at
the young man, raising his thumb and forefinger in a circle,
leaving the young man baffled as Ratso hurries Joe on.

               RATSO 
     Him I placed with O'Daniel just two
     weeks ago. And look. Not much of a
     stud either, what I hear...

EXT. CENTRAL PARK SOUTH - COCKTAIL HOUR

Ratso automatically checks the coin return boxes of the phone
booths they pass. Walking the park side of the street,
looking across at the limousines and taxis waiting outside
luxury hotels and apartment buildings.

               JOE
     Hey, listen, how about you take me
     to mee this Mister O'Diddle bird
     right now?

               RATSO 
     Well, Joe, you're a nice guy, and
     I'd be doing you both a favor, but
     why? What'm I dragging my bum leg
     all over town for? It's no picnic
     and what for, for me myself, what?

Ratso stops opposite the Plaza hotel, pointing across at an
aristocratic blonde stepping out of a Rolls Royce.

               RATSO (CONT'D)
     Tomorrow when some piece like
     that's scratching your back in a
     Fifth Avenue townhouse, where'll
     your pal Rizzo be? Nedicks.

               JOE 
     Hold it, just hold it. You think
     I'm that kinda sombitch? Just name
     your cut, whatever you want, you
     got it right now. Five? Ten, how's
     that?

Joe peels a ten from his wallet and offers it to Ratso.

               RATSO 
     Joe, please. You know what I'd ask
     anyone else? Oh hell, tell you what
     I'll do, I'll take the ten...
            (he does)
     ... but when I hand you over to Mr.
     O'Daniel, I'll have to have another
     ten, Joe; just to like cover
     expenses...

INT. PUBLIC PHONE BOOTH - DUSK

Ratso is on the phone. Joe holds the door open, listening.

               RATSO 
     This boy is just your meat, Mr.
     O'Daniel, believe it, I'm telling
     you -- what? -- Enrico Rizzo from
     the Bronx. The point is he needs
     you. Right now. Tonight...
            (aside to Joe)
     I got his tongue hanging out...

EXT. WEST SIDE HOTEL - DUSK

Camera moves slowly up the anonymous wall of a drab hotel,
following the line of dim red lights marking the fire exits.

               RATSO'S VOICE
     Name's Joe Buck. Cowboy. Just in
     from Texas, don't know the ropes,
     new to the city, but very promising
     material, sir, and ready, if you
     get what I mean. Fabulous. Right
     away. What's that room number there
     again? 

INT. WEST SIDE HOTEL ELEVATOR - DUSK

As ancient open cage lift rises at the same pace as camera in
preceding shot. Joe grins excitedly at Ratso, who nods but
glances significantly at the elevator operator. Ratso follows
Joe to door as the operator grinds to a stop.  

INT. WEST SIDE HOTEL CORRIDOR - DUSK 

Ratso steps out with Joe, gesturing to the corridor...

               RATSO
     Hold it a second...

... but the operator slams the door and starts on up. Ratso
leans heavily on the down button, glancing at Joe.

               RATSO (CONT'D)
     Nine-oh-one, got it?

Ratso glances up the elevator shaft nervously, rings again
and turns back to Joe. 

               RATSO (CONT'D)
     Let's see how you look. Fine. You
     look fine. Now I'm gonna have to
     have that other ten...

               JOE
            (digs in wallet)
     Ten, ten -- I got a twenty -- take
     that...

               RATSO
     Oh hell, forget it. 

               JOE
     Now take it. Go on. 
            (gives it to him)
     Listen, where can I reach you?
     Cause I'm gonna make this right
     with you soon's I get me set up...

               RATSO
     Forget it.

               JOE
     I mean, dammit, where you live?

Ratso leans on the DOWN as the cage grinds slowly down into
view and stops. 

               RATSO
     Sherry-Netherlands Hotel. Now get
     your ass in there. He's waiting!

Ratso steps into the elevator as the door opens then closes,
leaving Joe alone, repeating "Cherry Neverlin" as he starts
along the corridor looking for 901. 

EXT. WEST SIDE HOTEL - DUSK 

Ratso bursts from the hotel, almost running as he disappears. 

INT. WEST SIDE HOTEL CORRIDOR - DUSK

Joe finds 901 at a dark end of the corridor, knocks
confidently, hearing a few bars of his love theme as he
stuffs a fresh stick of gum in his mouth. Then the door is
thrown open by O'DANIEL -- for an instant appearing to wear a
diamond-studded skull-cap, the naked overhead light bulb
bright after the dark corridor, halating in Joe's eyes like
the earlier dollar sign. 

               O'DANIEL
     You must be Joe Buck. Come in. 

O'Daniel, fat in a worn-out bathrobe, examines Joe like a
prodigal son as he leads him into the room -- as anonymous as
Joe's own room. 

               O'DANIEL (CONT'D)
     Am I tickled to find you, boy! Come
     on in and let's get a look at you.
     Turn around. Good strong back.
     You'll need it. So you want help --
     take a seat, relax, tell me about
     yourself. Cowboy, huh?

               JOE 
     No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but
     I'm a first class stud.

               O'DANIEL 
     Take it,easy, boy... 
            (laughs)
     Seems to me you're different than a
     lotta boys that come to me. Most of
     'em seem troubled, confused, but
     I'd say you knew exactly what you
     want.

               JOE
     You bet I do, sir.

               O'DANIEL 
     But I'll bet you got one thing in
     common with them other boys. I'll
     bet you're lonesome.

               JOE 
     Well, not too, I mean, a little.

O'Daniel rises suddenly in a fury of self-righteousness,
pacing, his voice simpering, whining sarcastically.

               O'DANIEL 
     I'm lonesome. I'm lonesome so I'm a
     drunk. I'm lonesome so I'm a dope
     fiend. I'm lonesome so I'm a thief,
     a fornicator, a whore-monger. Poop,
     I say, poop! I've heard it all and
     I'm sick of it, sick to death.

               JOE 
     Yessir, I can see that.

               O'DANIEL 
     Lonesomeness is something you take.
     You bear? Dammit, you take it and
     go about your business, that's all.

               JOE 
     Well, uh, I'm raring to go.

               O'DANIEL 
     Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy,
     huh?

               JOE 
     Uh, yessir.

               O'DANIEL 
     Ready for hard work, son?

               JOE
     Ready for anything.

               O'DANIEL 
     I got a hunch, Joe Buck, it's gonna
     be easier for you than most.

               JOE 
     Gonna be like money from home.

               O'DANIEL 
     Money from home, see, there's your
     strength, you put things in earthy
     terms any man can understand, son.
     I warn you I'm gonna use you, I'm
     gonna run you ragged!

Joe laughs, driving an obscene uppercut into the air.
O'Daniel laughs with him.

               O'DANIEL (CONT'D)
     You're a wonderful boy. You'n me
     gonna have fun, dammit, it don't
     have to be joyless. Say, why don't
     we get right down on our knees now?

               JOE
     Get down -- where?

               O'DANIEL 
     Right here, why not? I prayed in
     saloons, I prayed in the street, I
     prayed an the toilet. He don't care
     where, what He wants is that
     prayer.

O'Daniel drops on all fours, crawling to find the plug of an
electric cord. He shoves it into a wall socket, switches off
the overhead light and suddenly a hollow, tinted plastic
Jesus glows on the dresser. O.S. a revivalist congregation
sings. And now we notice, with Joe, placards and flags, horns
and tracts, all the paraphernalia of a street corner
evangelist.

               JOB 
     Shee-it...

               O'DANIEL 
     That's the ticket, just open your
     heart and let it flow. It ain't the
     words, it's the love beyond 'em!

EXT. REMEMBERED BAPTISM - ANOTHER TIME

Sally Buck sings with the congregation while a rawboned
preacher stands in the river, preparing to immerse little
Joe.

               O'DANIEL'S VOICE 
     Don't fight it, boy!

INT. WEST SIDE HOTEL ROOM - DUSK

O'Daniel tries to pull Joe down beside him.

               O'DANIEL 
     Pray and you shall be heard!

EXT. REMEMBERED BAPTISM - ANOTHER TIME

Camera becomes little Joe, glimpsing the fevered faces of
Sally Buck and the congregation singing on the riverbank,
just before being plunged under the river. O'Daniel's voice
reechoes, filtered through water.

               O'DANIEL
     Don't be frightened, son!

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT

Joe runs in aimless panic, pushing through the crowd, pursued
by O'Daniel's voice and the singing congregation.

               O'DANIEL
     Don't run from Jesus!

Joe stops short as he sees the front page of a tabloid on a
newsstand. There is a picture of Joe being led away by two
deputies, under a headline ALABAMA MURDERER SHOTGUNS ELEVEN.

EXT. FORTY-SECOND STREET - NIGHT

Joe searches the faces of the crowd, running forward suddenly
as he sees Jackie and the farmboy picked up by two men in a
large convertible. Joe chases the car to Eighth Avenue but
stops, frightened as he sees himself in multiple image on the
front of every newspaper displayed on a newsstand.

INT. EVERETT'S BAR - NIGHT

The saloon is almost empty during the after dinner lull. The
BARTENDER doesn't look up from his newspaper as Joe
approaches.

               JOE
     Say, you know that runty little
     bastard I was with?

               BARTENDER
     I don't know nothing.

Joe tenses as he sees the . tabloid picture of himself on the
back of the bartender's paper. Joe's hand closes around an
empty beer bottle, a terrible violence surging very near the
surface. O.S. women scream.

INT. REMEMBERED BEAUTY SALON - ANOTHER TIME

Reflected in the mirror, we see little Joe wildly smashing
bottles and glass display cabinets -- the voices of women
screaming O.S. -- little Joe hurling a perfume bottle which
shatters the mirror and his own image.

INT. EVERETT'S BAR - NIGHT

The empty beer bottle stands where it was. Joe has
disappeared. On the TV screen over the bar, sound drowned out
by the jukebox, we see a blowup of the tabloid photograph,
revealing a young man very similar to, but clearly not Joe.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT

Colorful lights still flash seductive promise. The vertical,
lights on the MONY tower reach bottom and freeze momentarily.

STILL PHOTOGRAPH

Joe at his hotel window staring out blankly. Gun fire O.S....

INT. SHOOTING GALLERY - DAY

The radio at Joe's ear is drowned out by a kid in cowboy hat,
shooting alone in the gallery.
Two policemen idly slap their thighs with night sticks. Joe
moves on, unconsciously checking the coin return box of a pay
phone.

STILL PHOTOGRAPH

Joe curled up on his bed like a baby, fully dressed, his
radio on the night stand. O.S. his love theme, remote,
hollow...

EXT. FORTY-SECOND STREET - NIGHT

Joe's radio is at his ear "... never too late to look great,
Ben's Bargain Basement's open 'till five a.m., miles and
miles of Western styles, worth more at any store, money talks
and nobody walks." For the first time, Joe is aware of the
other midnight cowboys lurking in doorways, the cruising
queens, the middle-age men in sport shirts. Joe moves on self
consciously as he sees a scar-faced policeman, unconsciously
massaging his night stick. Camera holds on a window display
of gag buttons, featuring NEW YORK WILL BREAK YOUR HEART,
BABY.

STILL PHOTOGRAPH

Joe soaking in the tub, eyes closed.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE DANCE HALL - DAY

Joe's radio promises job opportunities for young men eighteen
to twenty-five in the U.S. Air Force. He stands with a crowd
staring up at a girl go-go dancing in the window of SERGEANT
PEPPER'S LONELY HEART CLUB.

STILL PHOTOGRAPH

Joe staring in the mirror. O.S. static over his love theme.

EXT. SIXTH AVENUE - NIGHT

By work-light, the tarrier in metal helmet leans on a jack
hammer, beyond the sign DIG WE MUST, drowning out Joe's
radio.

STILL PHOTOGRAPH

Joe flexing his muscles in his jockey shorts while -- LIVE ON
TV SCREEN -- a physical culture personality finishes push-ups
and starts pitching his own extra protein bread.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE PANCAKE HOUSE - DAY

Joe's radio continues the super-break commercial while a fry
cook flips flapjacks in the window.
But Joe's eyes are on a sign DISHWASHER WANTED. Joe looks up
and his eyes meet those of the young man scraping garbage
behind the counter. It's Joe.

               JOE 
     Shee-it.

STILL PHOTOGRAPH

Joe sits in the hotel lobby, staring out at the street,
unable to concentrate on his comic book. On two-way radio, a
woman's voice giggles as she speaks, "When I can't sleep,
well, I just dial the time and listen to those old seconds
clicking by like, you know, counting sheep?"

EXT. SIDEWALK CAFE - COCKTAIL HOUR

Joe watches a young man hold a taxi door for an older lady,
at the same corner where Ratso waved to another young man.
The woman's predatory eyes linger momentarily on Joe before
she leads the young man into the Cafe. The two-way radio
continues over, "... that's what I do about insomnia."

               JOE 
     Well, now, ma'am, next time you got
     that feeling coming on, you dial
     Joe Buck. I'll show you what to
     do...

STILL PHOTOGRAPH

Joe straddles a chair, staring at a blank TV screen.

               SINGING COMMERCIAL 
     Need a little easy money? It's E-Z.
     Want a little easy cash? It's E-Z.

E-Z LOAN COMMERCIAL

As the jingle continues, we follow Joe and his radio into the
loan office, the depressing reality photographed and edited
in the style of a TV commercial:

               JINGLE 
     Easy locations to get to 
     Easy ladies to greet you 
     Easy chairs to seat you 
     Easy payments to meet 
     Let E-Z set you 
     On Easy Street 
     Joe arrives confident      
     Harassed E-Z receptionist     
     Lines of uneasy customers       
     Desperate, angry faces     
     Reams of E-Z forms to fill  
     Clerk's sneer, says          
     Joe has to be kidding

INT. TIMES SQUARE PALACE LOBBY - NIGHT

Joe's image frozen -- as if another still photograph -
standing at the desk, waiting for his key.

               JOE'S VOICE 
     Key to 1014...

Action continues as the DESK CLERK hands Joe a folded paper
instead of a key. Joe opens it, deeply perplexed.

               DESK CLERK 
     Looks like you been locked out of
     your room, buddy. Till you pick up
     your tab.

               JOE
     Uh, what about my things'n all?

               DESK CLERK 
     We keep them nice and safe till you
     get this straightened out.

INTERCUT

Room 1014 warm and inviting, Joe's suitcase on the bed.

               JOE 
     Listen, tell you what, you can keep
     all the rest of the goddam junk if
     you let me have just the suitcase.
     That suitcase means a lot to me.

INTERCUT

The postcard photograph marked X -- THIS IS ME.

               DESK CLERK
     We keep everything. House rules.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT

Joe stands outside the hotel, stunned, seeing the bright
colored lights turn suddenly grey. The film continues in
black and white as Joe walks into the crowd.

EXT. SALLY BUCK'S BEAUTY SALON - DAY

The FOR RENT sign flapping in the wind.

INT. BAR - DAY

Joe nurses a short beer, like the regulars. He looks up as a
crippled panhandler approaches, vaguely reminiscent of Ratso.

               JOE 
     Screw off.

INT. ROOM 1014 - NIGHT

The bed turned back, clean sheets, a soft night light.

INT. BUS DEPOT - NIGHT

Joe is stretched on a bench, his Stetson over his eyes. A
loud speaker announces a bus "departing for Texas" but Joe
does not move. A policeman taps Joe's boots with his night
stick. Joe rises and starts away with mixed anger and
apprehension.

INT. PUBLIC MEN'S ROOM - DAY

Two matching Ivy Leaguers exchange a glance as they see Joe
washing his feet in the basin. Joe stares back with a
belligerent grin.

               JOE
     Any objection, gentlemen?

INT. ALL NIGHT CAFETERIA - NIGHT

Joe balances a cup of coffee, walking past the other solitary
night people, avoiding each other's eyes. Joe spots what he's
looking for and seats himself next to a gaunt woman and her
ten year old son, both freaked out, erratically touching
things, themselves, each other in a futile effort to make
contact with reality. But Joe is only concerned with the
plastic-wrapped crackers left by their empty soup bowls.

               JOB
     Y'ain't gonna eat them?

The woman stares at Joe blankly. The boy runs a toy mouse
across the table, up his mother's arm and around her face.
With a polite nod, Joe opens the crackers and squirts one
with ketchup. Joe upsets his chair as a great gob of ketchup
spills onto his pants...

               JOE
     Shee-it.

... glancing around with an embarrassed laugh, but the only
one looking is a cop, scratching his calf with a night stick.
Joe keeps his back to the customers as he moves to the water
dispenser, wets a paper napkin and tries to wipe away the
stain. But the water has only spread the stain across his
pants and down his leg. He blushes as a blonde young
streetwalker giggles.

               SALLY BUCK'S VOICE
     Wet your britches, lover boy?

INT. SUBWAY ARCADE - NIGHT

Joe tries to hide the stain with his jacket as he checks the
coin boxes of vending machines, wary as he passes a burly
policeman, abstractedly snapping his handcuffs in front of a
bakery window display of bride-and-groom wedding cakes. Joe
barely glances at a confused MIDDLE-AGE LADY.

               MIDDLE-AGE LADY
     How do I get to Grand Central?

               JOE
     Shuttle. Follow the green light.

Automatically,checking the trough of a gum vending machine,
Joe unexpectedly faces himself in the mirror, the eyes
staring at him tired and hopeless. His hand reaches
unconsciously for a cigarette, The package is empty. He
crumples it in his fist but holds it.

               JOE (CONT'D)
     Alright, cowboy. Enough of this
     shee-it. You know what you got to
     do? 
          (nods)
     Then go do it.

EXT. FORTY-SECOND STREET - NIGHT

Joe hurls the crumpled package into a DON'T BE A LITTERBUG
basket as he emerges from the subway, his radio at his ear.
The torchy voice belts his love song, merging with street
noises crying danger -- an ambulance, a burglar alarm, a
policeman's whistle -- the lights flashing lurid color for
the first time since Joe was locked out, no longer promising
but threatening, clashing, warning as...

... from a high angle, across the street, Joe joins the other
midnight cowboys, offering himself to all comers. His figure
is momentarily obliterated by traffic then...

... zooming in, we see Joe self-consciously trying to hide
the stain on his pants, embarrassed as a large sedan slows
then moves on to stop in front of a motorcycle freak. Joe is
briefly obliterated again by a passing police car...

... the receding flash of its turret light revealing Joe in
close conversation with a frightened young FAT BOY, whose
eyes plead for reassurance as Joe scowls.

INT. ROOM 1014 - DAY

Joe's black and white suitcase gleams on the bed.

               JOE'S VOICE
     Twenty-three bucks, I got to have
     twenty-three bucks...

INT. ALL NIGHT MOVIE - NIGHT

From an apparently empty balcony -- an old science fiction
film grinds endlessly through the night -- a lost spaceman
trying to make contact with a tantalizing Martian maiden
across an invisible time barrier, theremin voices calling,
"Earthling, where are you?"

               FAT BOY'S VOICE 
     Okay. Sure. I got twenty-five...

At the top of the balcony, Joe leans back, turning his face
away as the Fat Boy embraces him, kissing Joe's cheek and
neck, his head moving down out of frame to show -- on the
screen -- the spaceman and Martian maiden meeting, arms
outstretched. But the Martian maiden moves right on through
the spaceman, crying, "Earthling come back, however many
centuries it is, I'll wait!" Joe closes his eyes, forcing his
memory back...

INT. REMEMBERED MOVIE HOUSE - ANOTHER TIME

... repeating the remembered image of Anastasia and a younger
Joe, behind the movie screen...

               ANASTASIA 
     You're the only one, Joe, the only,
     only one ever!

... the remembered passion continuing, mounting -- intercut
with flash impressions, like flipping pages of a nudie
magazine -- naked, half-draped blondes gazing into camera
with sultry eyes, including one comic strip sexpot and the
calendar girl in Joe's Texas hotel room...

               ANASTASIA'S VOICE
     You're the best, the very best,
     yes, yes, kiss me, oh God please
     kiss me, Joe, now, now, now!

... Joe's face in extreme close-up, sounds of both movie
houses merging, confused, dominated by the voices of
adolescent boys...

               BOYS' VOICES 
     Hey, Joe, give someone else a
     chance! What's he doing for
     chrisake? He kissing Anastasia? You
     better swallow a whole goddam
     drugstore, man!

... an adolescent ratpack waiting in line behind the screen,
laughing in coarse whispers, watching Joe and Anastasia. O.S.
theremin voices call "Earthling, where are you?"

INT. ALL NIGHT MOVIE - NIGHT

On screen, the Martian maiden moves through the spaceman,
crying, "Earthling, come back, however many centuries it is,
I'll wait!"

INT. ALL NIGHT MOVIE RESTROOM - NIGHT

Joe watches the Fat Boy doubled over, retching.

               JOE
     I'm awful damn sorry you're sick,
     kid, but you gonna have to gimme
     that money like you said.

               FAT BOY 
     I was lying. I don't have it.
     What're you going to do to me?

               JOE 
          (controls fury)
     What you got in your pockets?

Eagerly, the boy produces a family photograph, a subway
token, a dirty handkerchief. Joe grabs his wrist, revealing a
watch.

               JOE (CONT'D)
     How much's that worth?

               FAT BOY 
     I can't go home without my watch!
     My mother'd die! She'd die! Take my
     books! Not my watch! She'd die!

But Joe has already kicked open the door. Theremin voices
drown out the Fat Boy, calling "Earthling, where are you?"

INT. ALL NIGHT MOVIE - NIGHT

Joe sprawls, trying to sleep, his feet on the balcony rail,
the radio at his ear. On screen, once again, the Martian
maiden moves through the spaceman, crying, but we hear the
voice of a desperate woman on two-way radio. As she speaks, a
policeman moves along the aisle, slapping his palm with his
night stick.

               DESPERATE VOICE 
     Bill, can I call you Bill, Mister
     Bonner? I feel like I know you from
     listening. What I called about,
     Bill, I'm gonna kill myself...

EXT. SIXTH AVENUE - DAY

From a high angle, only Joe's Stetson and radio can be seen
above a passing bus, its side panel advertising BILL BONNER'S
STRAIGHT LINE, A STRAIGHT TALK SHOW.

               BONNER'S VOICE 
     Why call me, baby? If you want to
     do it; just do it, don't talk about
     it. Are we drunky? Feeling a little
     sorry for ourselves maybe?

Joe appears in full figure as the bus passes. He stands
looking at the suitcases in a luggage shop window.

               DESPERATE VOICE 
     Well, Bill, what I got thinking, I
     didn't want the neighbors to have
     to find me, this young couple with
     the boy I want to have my cat, see,
     Bill?

INT. RADIO STATION - DAY

BONNER, tough in a grey crew-cut, talks on the phone.

               BONNER 
     Okay, baby, now listen, just hold
     on while I leave the line for a
     minute. And think about all the
     kids that are dying overseas for
     you, okay, baby? Got that? I'll be
     back in exactly sixty seconds.
     After this message from...

A taxi born blasts, interrupting the sponsor's message.

EXT. SIXTH AVENUE - DAY

Joe's fist slams a fender violently, using Ratso's fake
injury trick to stop traffic, running across the street
toward...

EXT. NEDICK'S - DAY

... Ratso staring out at Joe, paralyzed in the act of
lighting a cigarette -- intercut in flashing close-ups -- Joe
outside the window, Ratso inside -- reflecting their
conflicting emotions -- Joe's murderous rage -- Ratso's panic
-- one almost subliminal flash of each revealing something
like pleasure at finding a long-lost friend...

INT. NEDICK'S - DAY

... Ratso staring up into camera, holding his breath.

               RATSO 
     Don't hit me, I'm a cripple.

Joe's hand falls on Ratso's shoulder.

               JOE 
     Oh, I ain't gonna hit you, I'm
     gonna strangle you to death...

The cigarette in Ratso's mouth burns into his lip. He jerks
spasmodically, choking on smoke as he rips skin away with the
butt and drops it in his coffee cup.

               JOE (CONT'D)
     ... only first I'm gonna turn you
     upside down and shake you out right
     here and now.

Coughing, eyes tearing, Ratso empties his pockets on the
counter, finally producing: sixty-four cents, a few sticks of
gum, an almost empty cigarette package, a book of matches and
two pawn tickets. He raises his eyes, somehow ashamed. Joe
kicks the toe of Ratso's loafer.

               JOE 
     What's in your socks?

               RATSO 
     Not a cent, I swear to God, I swear
     on my mother's eyes.

Ratso removes his loafers and shakes them, glancing at the
counter man. His socks don't even conceal his toes.
Disgusted, Joe shoves Ratso's small pile back at him.

               RATSO (CONT'D)
     You keep the sixty-four cents. I
     want you to have it.

               JOE 
     It's sticky. What you do, slobber
     on 'em? I wouldn't touch 'em.

Joe should leave -- Ratso obviously has nothing tangible to
offer -- but Joe hesitates, lighting a cigarette as Ratso
pulls on his loafers.

               RATSO 
     How do you like that O'Daniel,
     flipping out like that? I wanted to
     get in touch with you when I heard,
     but I been laid up with this
     cold...

Ratso touches his chest, forcing a cough which continues
itself beyond his intention.

               JOE 
     You want some free medical advice,
     shut your goddam mouth about that
     night.

               RATSO 
     Okay, right, right, okay. Another
     subject. Where you living? Still at
     the hotel?

INT. ROOM 1014 - DAY

The black and white suitcase lies open on the bed.

INT. NEDICK'S - DAY

Joe turns abruptly and walks away.

               JOE 
     Shee-it. I got better things to do
     than talk to you.

EXT. SIXTH AVENUE - DAY

Joe strides north, pretending he doesn't hear...

               RATSO'S VOICE 
     Hey, wait up, for crissake!

... Ratso hop-skipping to overtake Joe at the traffic light.

               JOE 
     Listen, keep away from me, hear?
     You come near me again, I snatch
     you bald-headed!

               RATSO 
     I'm inviting you. I mean if you're
     not located, I got a place. I'm
     inviting you, goddamit.

               JOE 
     You inviting shee-it.

EXT. TENEMENT STREET - DAY

A contractor's sign announces LUXURY APARTMENTS AVAILABLE in
high-rise co-op, under construction beyond a raw of tenements
with X's taped on the windows. Ratso's voice continues over
the click-clack-click of Joe's boots and the flip-flap-squeak
of Ratso's loafers as camera moves toward a condemned
building.

               RATSO'S VOICE 
     The X on the window means the
     landlord can't collect rent --
     which is a convenience, hey? -- on
     account of it's condemned.

INT. TENEMENT STAIRS - DAY

Footsteps climb past rubbish piled outside empty flats.

               RATSO'S VOICE 
     The electric's off. Another
     convenience.
     I don't mess with Con Edison, hey?
     What the hell, I got candles,
     right?

INT. X FLAT - DAY

Light from the X window shines on a Florida tourist poster as
Ratso leads Joe into an abandoned tub-in-kitchen flat, barely
furnished with a table and chair, a rumple of blankets on a
burnt-out mattress.

               RATSO 
     I got no heat, but by that time,
     you know, cold weather, hey, I'll
     be in Florida. Stretch out. Make
     yourself comfortable. You hungry?
     I'll put up some water for coffee.

Ratso fills a saucepan from the tub-sink, sets it on a Sterno
stove. Joe sits himself on the mattress-bed, pretending to
test it, weeks of exhaustion and tension overwhelming him
suddenly, his only immediate problem being the effort to
restrain a large, comfortable yawn.

               JOE
     Comfortable, kee-rist, I slept on
     subways softer than this.

Joe stretches himself, yawning, his eyelids drooping heavily.
The sounds of the city recede. Joe's love theme plays softly
on a distant radio. Joe's eyes close momentarily in spite of
him elf.

INT. REMEMBERED CAR - ANOTHER TIME

A vintage dashboard, radio dial glowing, Anastasia's face.

               ANASTASIA
     Love me, Joe?

EXT. DEMOLITION SITE - DAY

A huge metal ball arcs on chain, demolishing a brick facade.

INT. X FLAT - DAY

Ratso's face seems to radiate evil as he lights a Sterno can.
Joe forces his eyes half-open.

               JOE
     Smart thing for me to do is haul
     ass outta here.

               RATSO
     Whatsa matter now?

Joe shivers, pulls a blanket around him, resisting sleep, but
the noises of demolition fade, the love theme lures Joe back.

               JOE 
     You don't seem like no fag...

               RATSO 
     What's that supposed to mean?

Joe's eyes close, his voice continuing out of half-sleep.

JOE 

Want me to stay here, y'after something. What y'after?

INT. REMEMBERED CAR - NIGHT

Joe's thumbnail flares a match, exposing Anastasia on the car
seat with Joe, both nearly naked. Anastasia butterfly-kisses
Joe's chest as he lights a cigarette.

ANASTASIA

Say you love me. Just say it.

JOE

Okay. I love you.

Anastasia purrs as her lips find Joe's breast, trying to
nurse. A flashlight flares suddenly through the car window.

NIGHTMARE - MULTIPLE SPLIT SCREEN

Low angle Ratso bending over Joe, into camera...
... Sally Buck shocked, hand still on switch...

... Ratso laughing as police beat Joe...

INT. X FLAT - NIGHT

Joe awakens in a cold sweat, fighting the blankets, wild-eyed
as he sees Ratso at the table, examining Joe's radio by
candle-light. Joe lunges across the room to snatch the radio
from Ratso's hands.

               RATSO
     For crissake!

Still wild-eyed, Joe suddenly points at his stocking feet.

               JOE
     Where's my boots -- ?

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAY

Joe facing the crowd, naked except for his boots.

INT. X FLAT - NIGHT

Ratso points to the boots on the floor by the mattress.

               JOB
     How'd they get off me?

               RATSO
     I took 'em off.

               JOE
     What for?

               RATSO
     So you could sleep! I mean Christ!

Joe inspects the boots, seats himself on a battered Army cot 
- which has been added while he slept -- swinging a boot by
its strap, considering whether to stay or go.

               RATSO (CONT'D)
     I drug in a cot, if you want to
     stay.

               JOE 
     Well now, Ratso, I'm gonna tell you
     something for your own good, only
     first gimme a cigarette.

Ratso offers a cigarette from his crushed package, Joe
strikes a match on his thumbnail and lights up, staring at
Ratso.

               JOE (CONT'D)
     You want me to stay here tonight,
     is that the idea?

               RATSO 
     I ain't forcing you, like, I mean,
     who's forcing you?

               JOE 
     Oh. Guess I got the wrong
     impression.

Joe makes a slow move to pull on one boot.

               RATSO 
     I want you to stay, okay? I goddam
     invited you, didn't I?

               JOE 
     Well, I hope you know what you're
     in for. I'm a very dangerous
     person. Someone does me bad like
     you. If I caught up with you that
     night, there'd be one dead Ratso
     long about now. Hear?

               RATSO 
     I'm impressed. You're a killer.

               JOE 
     So if you want me to hang around
     for a few days, I thought you
     should know.

Joe yawns, picks up a few blankets and spreads them on the
cot. He puzzles out the faded printing on one blanket.

               JOE (CONT'D)
     Property of the YMCA. You make me
     wanna puke sometimes, Ratso.

Ratso blows out the candle and wraps himself in blankets.

               RATSO 
     Joe -- do me one favor -- this is
     my place, am I wrong? You know, in
     my own place my name ain't Ratso. I
     mean it so happens my name is
     Enrico Salvatore Rizzo.

               JOE 
     Shee-it, man, I can't say all that.

               RATSO 
     Rico then, at least call me Rico in
     my own goddam place.

               JOE 
     Rico! Rico! Rico! Is that enough?
          (then)
     And keep your meat hooks off my
     radio.

EXT. VEGETABLE MARKET - DAY

Ratso wears a threadbare raincoat of faded black, several
sizes too large, as he shops with housewives at a sidewalk
vegetable stand -- elbowing his way through the ladies,
testing fruit, picking up vegetables and putting them back --
till the GREENGROCER spots him.

               GREENGROCER 
     You! Out! Out! I told you, I calla
     cops!

The other shoppers deliberately turn their backs, avoiding
involvement. As the Greengrocer grabs Ratso, Joe ambles into
the scene, wearing his dangerous little smile.

               JOE 
     Hey, looka here, that ain't nice,
     picking on a cripple...

Joe intervenes just long enough for Ratso to escape, then
ambles on, leaving the Greengrocer in frustrated fury. Camera
holds on a tray of coconuts.

INT. X FLAT - DAY

Joe lies on his cot, watching Ratso struggle to penetrate the
fibrous husk of a coconut, experimenting with a variety of
rusty tools in an old cigar box.

               RATSO 
     The two basic items necessary to
     sustain life are sunshine and
     coconut milk. That's a known fact.
     If I can find the goddam hole the
     milk squirts out.

               JOE 
     This is an okay setup you got here,
     but I'd say you ain't just exactly,
     uh, flush, is that right or not?

               RATSO
     I been sick. Hold this, will ya?

Joe takes his time rising to hold the coconut while Ratso
tries to poke a hole with a bent ice-pick.

               RATSO (CONT'D)
     In Florida, they come smooth, ready
     to eat.
     Down there, your only problem is,
     diet-wise, you gotta lift an arm to
     wipe warm milk off your chin.
     Tough, hey?

               JOE 
     I think finding you's the smartest
     thing I ever did, for both of us.
     You just the crooked kinda sneaky
     little sidewinder I need to get me
     hustling in this town. Hey!

Joe jerks his hand away just in time to avoid the ice-pick.
The coconut bounces on the floor. Ratso picks it up, holds
it, while Joe tries to crack it, swinging his boot like a
hammer.

               RATSO 
     Miami Beach is the only place for a
     real hustler. Florida has more rich
     chicks per square yard than any
     resort spot in the world. They lie
     out in their pagodas and pergolas
     waiting to grab the first jockstrap
     that passes.

               JOE 
     What's all this sweet talk about
     Florida? Your friend O'Daniel got a
     stable down there now?

Joe swings violently. Ratso yelps, hopping on his one good
leg, sucking his thumb.

               RATSO 
     Cowboy killers! Break my finger,
     Christ! I got news for you, baby,
     no chick with any class buys that
     big dumb cowboy crap...

Ratso holds his thumb under the tub-sink faucet.

               RATSO (CONT'D)
     ... the cowboy bit's out, except
     among fags of a certain type, which
     take a certain, type hustler to
     exploit. Like I could handle it --
     being a stealing operation
     basically -- but take your average
     fag, very few of them want a
     cripple.

Joe holds the coconut like Yorick's skull, thinking hard.*

               JOE 
     Well, I am dumb, that's for sure. I
     don't talk right. I can't think too
     good. Just only one thing I ever
     been good for's loving. Women go
     crazy for me. Fact. Crazy Annie.
     Had to send her away. So I don't
     cash in on that, what am I? I'm
     shee-it. May's well flush me down
     that hole with the dishwater.

Joe sets the coconut on the floor, holding it with both hands
while he tries to smash it with the heel of his boot.

               JOE (CONT'D)
     That's why you gonna stop crapping
     about Florida and get your skinny
     butt moving to earn twenty bucks
     worth of management you owe me...

INT. ROOM 1014 - DAY

The suitcase lies open, displaying Joe's wardrobe.

               JOE'S VOICE 
     Make that twenty-three bucks.

INT. X FLAT - DAY

Joe slams his heel down. The coconut shoots out from under
him and he lands on his ass.

               RATSO 
     Look at yourself, Joe, no offense,
     but frankly, you're beginning to
     smell. For a stud in this town
     that's a handicap.

               JOE 
     You talk like a man with a tin
     twat.

Ratso sets the coconut on the window sill, balancing it as he
raises the X window.

               RATSO 
     You ain't got a chance in hell. You
     need threads and glitter, baby. A
     front, hey?

               JOE 
     Well, uh, my manager's gonna manage
     all that crap, or else he gonna get
     a coconut up his flue.

Joe slams, the window down. The coconut flies down to crash
O.S. on the sidewalk below.

EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY

An alley cat laps up the milk of the broken coconut.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - FANTASY

Joe stands naked in the middle of traffic. A siren shrills.
Anastasia, catatonic in a hospital smock, moves toward Joe
like a sleepwalker, passing through him.

INT. LAUNDROMAT - DAY

Wearing only his boots, Joe sits like an Indian chief,
wrapped in a blanket -- angle widening to show Ratso,
spotting Joe's jacket, slacks and shirt with cleaning fluid --
his eyes on a very pregnant Italian lady. As she starts to
load a coin cleaning machine, Ratso intervenes solicitously,
speaking in Italian...

               RATSO 
     A woman in your condition shouldn't
     do that. Let me help...

... adroitly slipping Joe's cleaning in with her load as she
turns to seat herself beside Joe.

               JOE'S VOICE 
     It ain't right, stealing from a
     pregnant lady.

INT. HAT CLEANERS - DAY

Joe and Ratso stand waiting at the counter.

               RATSO 
     What did it cost her? The
     laundromat syndicate lost a couple
     coins. I'm crying.

The owner brings Joe's clean and blocked Stetson from the
rear of the shop. Joe sets it on his head and examines
himself in a mirror as the owner hands Ratso, the bill.

               RATSO (CONT'D)
     Where's mine? The black homburg? I
     brought it in the same time.

The owner glances at the slip, puzzled, returns to the rear
of the shop to search for the nonexistent homburg. Ratso
quickly drags Joe away from the mirror and out of the shop.

INT. SUBWAY ARCADE - NIGHT

The rhythmic duet of boots and loafers follows Joe and Ratso 
- checking coin boxes and telephone booths -- till they reach
a shoeshine stand, locked for the night. They loiter till a
young couple has disappeared, then Joe kicks loose 'the
padlock on the equipment drawer, mounts one of the chairs and
Ratso goes to work on his boots with furious expertise,
flourishing double brushes, snapping the rag like a jazz
drummer.

               JOE 
     Hey, you're good! I bet you could
     pick up a living at this if you
     tried.

               RATSO 
     And end up a hunchback like my old
     man? You think I'm crippled? You
     shoulda caught him the end of a
     day.

Ratso demonstrates a chimpanzee walk. Joe laughs. Ratso turns
back in panic as another man takes a chair next to Joe. Ratso
is about to retuse when a cop takes the third chair, swinging
his handcuffs around to the front, tapping his shoe with his
night stick. Ratso quickly drops a rag over the broken
padlock, cursing under his breath as he starts working on all
three customers at the same time.

               RATSO'S VOICE 
     You think it's funny?

INT. X FLAT - DAY

Joe is seated in a straight-back chair near the X window, a
towel tucked around his neck as Ratso trims his hair, almost
as expert a barber as shoeshine boy.

               RATSO 
     Stupid bastard coughed his lungs
     out breathing that resin all day.
     They buried him with gloves on.
     Even the fag undertaker couldn't
     get his nails clean.

As if by conditioned reflex, Ratso chokes on the cigarette in
his mouth, coughing painfully. He crushes it out, opens the
window to spit, shivering, then slam it and turns back to
remove the towel from Joe's neck.

               JOE 
     Kee-rist, you pretty damn clever
     for a skimpy little gimp.

               RATSO 
     You like it? Take a look.

               JOE 
     Don't rush me. How I do it, see, I
     get myself primed, like I was
     turning on the charm for some
     pretty little blonde lady, then
     kinda mosey away slow and easy and 
     - swing around! -- and there you
     are, you handsome devil.

Joe performs his ritual as he speaks, but more relaxed,
faintly laughing at himself with Ratso. The wall mirror has
been added since we last saw the flat, along with a legless
overstuffed chair with burnt-out cushions, a tasselled table
cover, pinups, calendar girls and several new Florida tourist
posters, Ratso moves to Joe's side, arranging the
neckerchief, nodding.

               RATSO 
     Not bad -- for a cowboy -- you're
     okay, you're okay.

               JOE 
     What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna make a
     cowboy outta you, kid. How about
     that? Build you up a little, teach
     you couple little tricks'n turn
     y'out to stud, Rat-stuff.

Joe slaps his hat on Ratso's head, tilts it, hooks Ratso's
thumbs in his jeans and shoves a cigarette into the corner of
Ratso's mouth. Ratso laughs till he chokes -- for one
instant, self-consciously, mimicking Joe -- then removes the
hat and reaches for his threadbare black raincoat.

               JOE (CONT'D)
     Okay, you got yourself one
     handsome, sweet-smelling cowboy,
     strut your stuff...

EXT. CONVERTED TOWN HOUSE - DAY

Joe and Ratso peer down through a basement bay window, into
the office of THE PERFECT GENTLEMAN ESCORT SERVICE --
endorsed by leading travel agencies and credit clubs offering
discreet companionship and personal guided tours in any
language. A large-busted matron, on a French phone, fills out
a memo and hands it to an immaculate young ESCORT, who slips
the memo into his topcoat pocket as he comes from the office
and hails a cab. Ratso darts forward, limping exaggeratedly,
holding the door, lifting the memo as he brushes off the
Escort's topcoat. The young man waves him away with out a
tip. Ratso slams the door and bites his thumb after the cab,
unfolding the memo as he joins Joe on the sidewalk.

               RATSO 
     How do you like that? Cheap
     bastard...
          (reads, then)
     I think we struck gold. This is one
     high-class chick. The Barbizon for
     Women!

EXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE - DUSK

The Mutual of New York tower flashes MONY.

INT. CORNER PHONE BOOTH - DUSK

Ratso consults the memo as he speaks into the phone.

               RATSO 
     Mr. McNeill, I'm calling for Miss
     Beecham at the Barbizon Hotel for
     Women. She won't need you
     tonight...

EXT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT

A doorman helps a young lady into a limousine.

               RATSO'S VOICE 
     Would you believe a whole goddam
     hotel with nothing but lonely
     chicks?

Joe and Ratso watch from across the street.

               RATSO 
     Score once in that setup, the way
     chicks talk, Christ...

Joe cracks his gum, tilts his hat, starts across the street.

               RATSO (CONT'D)
     Get the money! Remember Cass
     Trehune? Cash! These rich bitches
     write a check at night, call the
     bank and stop payment in the
     morning. Get the cash!

In Ratso's eyes -- as Joe enters the hotel -- its facade
suddenly wipes away to reveal rich ladies in negligee waiting
in every room.

INT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT

Joe starts up the stairs, two at a time. A BELLHOP grabs him.

               BELLHOP 
     Hey! No men upstairs!

EXT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT

Ratso warms his hands at a chestnut vendor's cart, seeing...

... zoom close-up, a lady in a window grabbing Joe.

INT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT

Joe picks up a house phone, watched by the Bellhop.

EXT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT

Ratso sees Joe zip from room to room in wild animation.

INT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT

The lobby watches Joe blow a gum bubble at the elevator.

EXT. EXCLUSIVE DRESS SHOP - NIGHT

Staring at a window display of Florida sportswear, Ratso's
imagination soars, seeing...

EXT. FLORIDA BEACH FRONT - FANTASY

... Ratso, like a model in a travel poster, in gaudy sport
shirt, talking on the phone against a background of hotels...

... Ratso like James Bond, surrounded by bikinis, dictating
while girls serve coconut milk and massage his game leg...

... Ratso like George Raft, in evening clothes, running a
posh casino, flicking a coin...

... Ratso simply himself, dressed as he is, sitting on the
beach, at peace in the sun...

... the same identical picture with Joe sitting beside Ratso.

INT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT

Joe faces MISS BEECHAM, a reserved and rather plain young
lady in evening dress, She tries to speak softly.

               MISS BEECHAM 
     I'm afraid there's been a terrible
     mistake...

EXT. EXCLUSIVE DRESS SHOP - NIGHT

Ratso leans against the window, flipping a coin.

EXT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT

Miss Beecham is flushed with humiliation, the entire lobby
watching Joe in the hands of two bellboys.

               JOE 
     I want my money, goddamit, you owe
     me my money whether you get laid or
     not, lady, shee-it!

EXT. EXCLUSIVE DRESS SHOP - NIGHT

The lights in the window suddenly switch off, blacking out
Florida. Ratso glances toward the growl of a siren O.S.

EXT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT

A police prowl car slows in front of the hotel. Ratso swings
across the street with incredible speed to meet Joe as he's
tossed onto the sidewalk. Ratso picks up the Stetson and
brushes it off, then helps Joe to his feet.

EXT. SIXTH AVENUE - NIGHT

From a high angle -- the two figures move slowly along the
deserted avenue, their rhythmic musical duet growing more and
more faint in the distance, a broken grasshopper and a six
foot tarnished cowboy -- passing a tuxedo rental store, next
to a lighted sign -- TEMPERATURE IN MIAMI BEACH, FLORIDA 89
DEGREES -- their pace slowing to a dead stop...

INT. X FLAT - NIGHT

... Joe and Ratso frozen -- rain on the X windowpane freezing
into sheet ice. O.S.
a radio commercial plays warm, sentimental music while a cozy
voice explains how easy it is to heat with Humble oil.

EXT. CONDEMNED TENEMENTS - DAY

Joe and Ratso frozen in a narrow shaft of sunlight, watching
the huge metal ball demolish the building next door. O.S. a
radio announcer sells FROZEN SUNSHINE ORANGE JUICE.

INT. X FLAT - NIGHT

Joe and Ratso frozen, staring significantly at Joe's radio.
O.S. a singing commercial, "Don't wheeze and sneeze the
winter away! Drink Frozen sunshine every day!" 

EXT. PAWN SHOP - DAY

Through the window -- Joe and Ratso watch the pawnbroker
examine Joe's radio, "Be healthier, wealthier, life can be
fine, when you drink Frozen" -- Sunshine is clicked off by
the pawnbroker.

INT. X FLAT - NIGHT

Joe and Ratso frozen, wrapped in blankets as...

... the canned heat dies with a faint puff...

... water dripping in the tub-sink freezes into an icicle...

... the candle burns down and out, leaving the screen dark.

EXT. CONDEMNED TENEMENTS - DAY

Joe and Ratso warm themselves on the smoke and steam rising
from a subway grating -- watching two officials in fur
collared coats inspect the front of their X flat building.
Reading their doom, Joe and Ratso, continue on, disappearing
into the subway.

EXT. FORTY-SECOND STREET - NIGHT

Joe stands alone, watching the midnight cowboys ply their
trade. Camera pulls back as Joe turns away and enters a store
front blood bank, offering ten dollars to blood donors.

INSERT

A huge hypodermic fills the frame, sucking Joe's blood. O.S.
Ratso coughs uncontrollably.

INT. X FLAT - NIGHT

Ratso leans over the tub-sink, dry-heaving while he coughs,
wearing a sheepskin coat much too large for him. He controls
the cough with effort -- hearing the door open and close O.S.
-- wipes his mouth and turns to grin at...

... Joe, trying to light the empty Sterno can, deliberately
ignoring Ratso. Ratso shrugs, washes his mouth at the faucet,
finds a cigarette butt and lights it, careful to avoid
inhaling the first puff.

               JOE 
     Shee-it. Cough yourself inside out,
     then light a fag, a goddam fag. You
     make me puke. Where'd you steal it?
     In the movies?

               RATSO 
     The coat? A guy I did a favor once
     gave it to me. Christ.

               JOE 
     Who'd you ever do a favor for? You
     just let some poor bastard freeze
     to death, wouldn't you?

Joe slams ten dollars on the table. Ratso glances at Joe with
curious concern.

               RATSO 
     Where'd that come from?

               JOE 
     Forty-second Street. Where'n hell
     you think it come from?

               RATSO 
     You wanna know the truth? You dumb
     bastard, I got it for you. Look at
     it. Goddam thing's ten sizes too
     big for me.

Ratso pulls off the coat and throws it at Joe.

               JOE 
     Wear it yourself. I wouldn't put it
     on my back.

Joe throws it back at Ratso.

               RATSO 
     Goddamned if I'll wear it!

Ratso hurls it in a corner. Joe shoves the ten at Ratso.

               JOE 
     Go get your medicine. Before you
     die on my goddam, hands...

EXT. EAST RIVER BRIDGE - DAY

High angle -- Joe and Ratso cross an foot, chilled by wind,
neither wearing the sheepskin coat. The Queens riverfront and
factories appear cold and bleak, deserted on Sunday.

EXT. LONG ISLAND CEMETERIES - DAY

Camera moves into acres of tombstones, piled like low-rent
housing projects for the dead, the various faiths segregated
by crumbling boundaries.

               JOE'S VOICE
     Shee-it. I hate boneyards.

               RATSO'S VOICE 
     So split. He ain't your goddam,
     father.

EXT. PROTESTANT CEMETERY - DAY

Ratso leads Joe past a Negro family at a grave -- glances
around -- snatches an elaborate floral piece from a headstone
and hides it under his black raincoat as he darts toward a
low dividing wail and swings himself over into...

EXT. CATHOLIC CEMETERY - DAY

... an endless section of plain stone markers. Joe touches
his hat to two nuns, guiltily hurrying to overtake Ratso at
ibis father's grave, indistinguishable from the other graves
except for the name on the headstone. Ratso places the floral
piece on the grave with almost absurd solemnity. Joe laughs.

               JOE 
     Kee-rist, you sure are one twisty
     little bastard, Ratso.

               RATSO 
     The name's Rico, at my own father's
     grave, a man deserves some respect.

               JOE
     Respect shee-it! You even steal
     flowers for his grave.

               RATSO
     Can he smell the difference, eh?

Joe reads from the ribbon on the floral display.

               JOE 
     Well, uh, he dam well know he ain't
     'be-loved Aunt Winifred'.

               RATSO
     He can't read. Even dumber than
     you. Couldn't write his own name. X
     -- that's what it ought to say
     there on that goddam headstone. One
     big lousy X like our flat.
     Condemned. By order of City Hall.

Joe is frowning, standing at the,headstone, momentarily
depressed with an undefined sorrow.

               JOE 
     My Grammaw Sally Buck, she died
     without letting me know.

EXT. SALLY BUCK'S BEAUTY SALON - DAY

Through the window, past the FOR RENT sign, the tarnishing
driers are lined up like tombstones.

EXT. JEWISH CEMETERY - DAY

Joe frowns, puzzled, as Ratso pulls out a black skullcap,
leading Joe toward a group of professional mourners,
whispering:

               RATSO 
     Just keep your hat on and cry a
     little. They tip you when it's
     over.

Joe and Ratso join the mourners as the funeral moves to the
grave, Ratso mouthing an authentic double-talk...

... Joe standing self-consciously, aware of the covert
glances of the other mourners, automatically reaching up to
remove his hat, remembering when Ratso elbows him in the
ribs...

... Joe scowling, tight-lipped, embarrassed by the tip that
is thrust in his hand.

INT. LUNCH COUNTER - EVENING

A weary Santa Claus, in a rented beard and over-large
costume, warms his hands over the steam of his coffee cup.
Joe and Ratso are arguing farther down the counter.

               JOE 
     Just ain't right, cheating someone
     dead and can't cheat back.

In the background, as Ratso speaks, HANSEL and GRETEL
MACALBERTSON enter the lunch counter, inspecting the
customers one by one. Both wear black turtlenecks and jeans,
dressed as twins, both blond and pretty.

               RATSO 
     You and my old man. Same kinda
     mind. Putting me down till the day
     he died...
          (mimics)
     ... why can't you be like your
     brothers? Sons a father could be
     proud of. Yeah, sure. My brothers.
     Too goddam busy making something of
     themselves to show up when the old
     man's dying!

Conditioned reflex, Ratso starts to cough. Joe sees the
MacAlbertsons in the mirror, standing behind him, studying
him. Gretel nods, Hansel hands Joe a large black card,
smiling vaguely, then moves on.

               RATSO (CONT'D)
     What was that all about?

Joe studies the black card, frowning at first, suddenly
smiling, turning as if to call after the MacAlbertsons, but
they are disappearing around the corner. Joe hands the card
to Ratso.

               JOE 
     You wanna read something, read
     this. I been invited somewhere.

Shocking pink letters on the black card read YOU ARE INVITED
TO HELP US BURY LOVE -- TONIGHT AT BROADWAY AND HARMONY LANE 
- HANSEL AND GRETEL MACALBERTSON.

               JOE (CONT'D)
     They picked me. The only one in the
     whole goddam place. You see how
     they looked me over, up and down
     before they give me that?

               RATSO 
     So?

Joe sees a young man washing cups behind the counter. Joe
shakes his head, wonderingly, turning to study himself in the
mirror.

               JOE 
     Well, this thought just struck me.
     It wasn't too long ago I was
     washing dishes way the hell
     somewhere in Texas.

               RATSO 
     Yeah, well, so?

               JOE 
     Now I'm here. I'm in New York City.
     Getting picked for things. Don't
     you see what I'm driving at?

               RATSO 
     What you're driving at, you want me
     to get lost so you can go to your
     fancy-ass party.

               JOE 
     Did I say that? Did I? 
          (studies card)
     It don't say nothing about you...

               RATSO 
     Don't say nothing about you either.

               JOE 
     But they picked me, right? So what
     I'll do, I'll just say, now look,
     you want me? Well, I don't go
     nowhere without my buddy here.

               RATSO
          (shrugs)
     Well, what the hell, I got nothing
     better to do.

EXT. LOFT BUILDING - NIGHT

Snow swirls in the aureole of a street light as Joe and Ratso
run, heads lowered, turning into...

INT. LOFT BUILDING - NIGHT

... a drab entrance hall, dimly lit -- signs identifying
various commercial tenants -- a pink-on-black placard reading
MACALBERTSON, TWO FLIGHTS UP. Joe has started up before he
notices Ratso, leaning on the bannister at the foot of the
stairs, struggling to catch his breath. His face and hair are
wet with perspiration, his lips lavender-blue.

In swift flashes -- intercut -- Joe reads the panic in
Ratso's eyes, so intense that Joe shares it, unable to speak
or offer reassurance.

               JOE 
     Better dry your hair some. You
     sweating all over the goddam place.

Joe pulls out his shirttail, grabs Ratso by the neck and rubs
his head dry.

               JOE (CONT'D)
     You got a comb?

               RATSO 
     Don't need a comb.

               JOE 
     Few dozen cooties won't kill me,
     don't guess.

Joe hands Ratso his own comb. Ratso swipes at his tangled
hair angrily until two teeth break in the comb. He hands the
comb back, tugs at his hair with his fingers, pats it in
place, then looks back into Joe's eyes.

               RATSO
     Okay? I look okay?

In a moment of silence, distant sounds can be heard -- a
siren, the grinding teeth of a garbage truck, the twang of an
electric guitar upstairs at the party -- then Ratso makes a
quick gesture of impatience and starts up the stairs, pulling
himself on the bannister.

INT. MACALBERTSONS' LOFT - NIGHT

A bank of lights blinds Joe and Ratso as they enter --
electronic rock blasts their ears -- a bearded cameraman on a
step-ladder photographs them as they stand confused -- facing
a monstrous collage of tabloid photos blown up, showing the
murder of a hippie known as Groovy -- in-huge black letters,
LOVE WAS GROOVY -- GROOVY IS DEAD. Joe shouts over the
amplified music.

               JOE 
     Better get a hold of someone and
     tell them I'm here.

Ratso points to his ear -- he can't hear -- following Joe
across the room. The huge loft is crowded with a random
selection, gathered to serve as dress extras in an
underground film. The party is the scene. The MacAlbertsons
merely supply the ingredients and allow it to happen, with
cameras strategically placed to record the happening...

... Hansel with tape recorder, Gretel with hand-held camera 
drifting through the crowd -- catching words and images in a
detached, whimsical fashion. Gretel turns her camera on Joe
and Ratso as they approach.

               JOE (CONT'D)
     Well, I made it. This here is Ratso
     Rizzo and I...

               RATSO 
     Rico. Rico Rizzo.

Gretel smiles without recognition. Hansel gestures vaguely.

               HANSEL 
     Do you need anything? I mean
     there's beer and so forth. Whatever
     your thing is...

The twins move away together, pausing to confer with the
operator of a tripod camera -- focused on an emaciated flower
girl with long hair and dirty feet, stretched in a
sarcophagus, clutching a dead daffodil, her eyes glazed.
Scrawled in huge letters on the wall over her head -- LOVE!

               RATSO
     If you want the word on that
     brother and sister act, I'll give
     you the word. That Hansel's a fag
     and Gretel's got the hots for
     herself. So who cares, right? Load
     up on the salami...

Ratso heads for the refreshment table. Joe starts after him
but pauses, intrigued by an alcove under the balcony where a
light show is in progress -- surreal images of naked bodies
projected against abstract currents of color and strobe
light...

... a bored fat lady in a muu-muu, squatted like a Buddha at
a low table, rolling joints for the guests.
She lights a joint and offers it to Joe as he wanders in to
watch the show. Joe laughs delightedly when he realizes what
it is...

               JOE 
     Shee-it, this is one helluva party!

... glancing around at the others, imitating their techniques
-- the quick inhaler, who follows with sharp gulps of air -
the deep inhalers who draw air as they inhale -- the stylist
who lets the smoke drift out and inhales through the nostrils
-- Joe puffing himself slightly dizzy, starting to laugh at
the silent flick effect of the strobe light -- the action
around him slowing almost imperceptibly, overcranked -- a
veil of smoke hanging over the fat woman's face, transforming
her into a laughing witch -- a similar veil around Joe's
head, relaxing the self-conscious tension of his face,
spontaneously curious about the play of light on his hand,
grinning at...

... a serious young technician handling the light show,
scattering psychedelic stars across a sky of magenta flesh...

... Joe reaching for the stars as he rises and wanders back
to the crowded loft, fascinated to see...

... a crew with cameras and lights, on the balcony at one end
of the loft, photographing the scene below...

... a dark-haired lady by the name of SHIRLEY -- chic in the
style of a gangster's moll -- drinking beer from the bottle,
predatory eyes searching the crowd...

... Ratso surreptitiously stuffing his pockets from the
buffet table, glancing nervously over his shoulder, unaware
of Gretel and her hand-held camera, photographing Ratso as he
steals, turning away casually, disinterested...

... Joe laughing as he dances for a moment with a tall black
girl -- the lights swinging around them -- faces swimming...

... Shirley in fleeting close-up, gone in an instant,
reappearing...

INT. MACALBERTSON BATHROOM - NIGHT

... her face in the mirror smiling in a dark, provocative way
-- Joe standing at the bathroom door, forgetting to be
embarrassed as Shirley turns away from the mirror,
unhurriedly, running her fingers through her hair, boldly
meeting Joe's eyes.

               SHIRLEY 
     I can tell, can't you?

               JOE 
     Yeah, oh yeah.

               SHIRLEY 
     What'll we do? Leave now or what?
     Your place or mine? Oh God, the
     second I looked at you I knew. Did
     you?

Joe grins, watching Shirley's lips move, unable to keep her
in sync, startled to hear Ratso's voice.

               RATSO'S VOICE
     She's hooked...

INT. MACALBERTSONS' LOFT - NIGHT

Joe realizes he is back at the party, Ratso whispering
hoarsely.

               RATSO
     ... I'd say she was good for ten
     bucks, but I'll ask for twenty...

But Joe is watching with terrible fascination as Hansel and
Gretel lift the flower girl from her sarcophagus.

               SHIRLEY'S VOICE 
     Did you know? We were going to make
     it?

Joe glances down to see himself flanked by Ratso and Shirley.

               RATSO 
     You really want to do business?

               SHIRLEY
     Who's he? Oh God! Don't tell me you
     two are a couple -- ?

The flower girl, hypnotically dazed, accepts a broom dipped
in black paint and smears a huge X across LOVE. Joe laughs.

               HANSEL'S VOICE
     Why are you laughing, Joe?

Hansel holds a microphone toward Joe, who shrugs, grinning at
Ratso and Shirley. Gretel's camera moves down Joe's body.

               HANSEL
     Are you for real, Joe?

               JOE 
     Well, I ain't a f'real cowboy, but
     I'm one hell of a stud!

Shirley glances at Ratso, who nods, whispering in her ear.

               RATSO 
     A very expensive stud. And I happen
     to be his manager.

The scene -- from Joe's viewpoint -- becomes increasingly
confusing and fragmented, dialogue and image moving in and
out of focus, cameras and lights surrounding him, keeping the
center of attention in his own blown mind...

... Shirley's eyes unnaturally bright, inspecting his body,
lingering on his thighs, moistening her lips...

               SHIRLEY 
     It's too much -- to come face to
     face with a walking talking sex
     fantasy -- to buy a man's -- God!

... the tall black girl dancing in stroble light, starting to
remove her clothes -- Gretel following her with a camera...

               SHIRLEY'S VOICE
     I can't wait to tell my man Monday.
     I should be taking notes. Look at
     my arm!

... Shirley's talon-like fingernails caressing the gooseflesh
on her tanned arm...

               RATSO'S VOICE
     I gotta sit down. I feel crummy.

Ratso stretched out on a Victorian love seat -- the flower
girl walking unsteadily, passing out dead daffodils, placing
one in Ratso's hand Gretel photographing his reaction...

               SHIRLEY'S VOICE
     Eat it -- a man in your line of
     work has to keep his strength up...

... Shirley bringing Joe a massive sandwich on a paper plate,
watching him bite into it...

               SHIRLEY 
     It's fantastic, now I know,
     everything you do has sexual
     implications.
     If I you know, bought it -- could I
     take pictures of you naked? That's
     part of it, isn't it, kinky kinda
     things?

... the tall black girl and a few others are trying to
promote an orgy. A scrofulous old wino dances spastically,
working his toothless gums, preparing to expose himself to
two girls dancing together...

               HANSEL'S VOICE
     We want you, Joe. You've been
     chosen.

... five youths stand beside the sarcophagus -- two sailors,
two cycle freaks, a weight-lifter -- waiting to be
pallbearers. Joe joins them. All lights and cameras are
turned on the slow funeral procession, carrying the flower
girl out of the loft to the tune of "Moonlight and Roses".
Strobe light adds to the unreality of the scene...

               SHIRLEY'S VOICE 
     I had a thing for him. Before I
     knew. Why should knowing make it
     more of a thing?

... Shirley talks to Gretel as she photographs the funeral.

               SHIRLEY 
     Naturally I'll have to ask myself
     why a cowboy? And why a cowboy
     whore? But not tonight.

INT. MACALBERTSON LANDING - NIGHT

Shirley is pulling her coat out of the pile on the bannister.

               SHIRLEY 
     Incidentally, how much is this
     going to cost me anyway?

Joe turns to Ratso, whose attention is fixed on the coats.

               JOE 
     Tell her, Ratso.

               RATSO 
     Twenty bucks...

               SHIRLEY 
     Sold. Let's go.

               RATSO 
     ... and taxi fare for me.

               SHIRLEY 
     Get lost.

               RATSO 
     I agree. And for that service I
     charge one dollar taxi fare.

She takes a dollar from her purse and hands it to Ratso,
takes Joe's arm and starts down the stairs. Ratso lingers,
starting quickly through the coats, frisking them for loose
change.

INT. LOFT BUILDING LOBBY - NIGHT

At the foot of the stairs, Shirley kisses Joe violently.

               SHIRLEY 
     Your name's Joe. Which is fabulous.
     Joe could be anyone. Kiss me, Joe,
     move over, Joe, go away, Joe. It's
     just perfect.

They glance up as Ratso appears, swinging down too rapidly on
the bannister. He misses a step and falls -- a clown's fall,
unable to stop but apparently not hurting himself. Shirley
and Joe are laughing when Ratso lands at the foot of the
stairs.

               SHIRLEY (CONT'D)
     He fell. Hey, fella, you fell. Is
     he all right?

               RATSO
          (rises, mimics)
     Is he all right!

               JOE 
     Well, if you're awright, why you
     hanging on the bannister. Can you
     walk or not?

               RATSO 
     Walk? Naturally I can walk.

               SHIRLEY 
     He's got taxi fare.

               JOE 
     Sure you're all right?

               RATSO 
          (shouts)
     I said yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah!

INT. TAXICAB - NIGHT

Joe and Shirley are kissing. Shirley rolls away, flushed,
fanning herself. Joe rolls down the window.

EXT. VILLAGE STREET - NIGHT

Joe leans out of the taxi window, waving his Stetson,
bellowing at the snow.

               JOE
     Whoopee ti yi yo...!

EXT. LOFT BUILDING - NIGHT

Ratso makes his way slowly from the building to the curb,
whistling between his teeth sharply, hailing a cab. The cab
slows to a stop. Then the driver sees Ratso, shifts into gear
and drives on. Ratso bites his thumb after the cab, rests for
a moment on the lamp post, then starts painfully inching his
way along the deserted street.

INT. SHIRLEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Joe lies on his back, staring fixedly at a fragile mobile
hanging from the ceiling, stirring listlessly.

               SHIRLEY'S VOICE
     That happens. Don't worry about
     it...

Shirley leans on one elbow, looking at Joe sympathetically,
fighting an almost irrepressible desire to laugh. Still
avoiding Shirley's eyes, Joe finds a cigarette on the side
table, searches for matches.

               JOE 
     Well, that's something never
     happened to me before, you can bet
     your bottom dollar. Uh, where's the
     matches, ma'am?

               SHIRLEY 
     Top drawer. Maybe if you didn't
     call me ma'am, things would work
     out better.

Joe finds the matches, lights up and lies back, staring at
the mobile as he smokes, still not looking at Shirley.

               JOE
     First goddam, time it ever quit on
     me. Fact.

The repressed laugh finally breaks through. Shirley stifles
it quickly as Joe sits up, looking at her.

               JOE (CONT'D)
     You think I'm lying!

               SHIRLEY
          (controls herself)
     No. Of course not. Just something
     struck me funny...

Close on Joe -- watching Shirley closely, reacting.

               SHIRLEY'S VOICE 
     I just put myself in your shoes. I
     had this image of a bugler without
     a horn, a policeman without a
     stick, etcetera, etcetera and I...
          (giggles)
     I think I'd better shut up, I'm
     making it worse.

Shirley composes her face, reaching out to touch Joe. But
that doesn't help either. He reacts sharply.

               SHIRLEY 
     Maybe we should take a little nap,
     see what happens?

               JOE 
     I ain't sleepy.

               SHIRLEY 
     I know. Scribbage!

Extreme close-up of Joe -- frowning, puzzled...

               JOE 
     Shee-it...

... camera pulling back to show Joe concentrating on a game,
spread out on the sheet, consisting of nine dice lettered on
all sides, the object being to build as many words as
possible, Scrabble fashion, while a sand timer counts the
seconds. Shirley watches Joe's efforts to think with
sympathetic amusement. The only word Joe has composed so far
is MAN.

               SHIRLEY 
     That's pretty Freudian, Joe.

               JOE 
     What? It's a perfectly good word,
     ain't it. How much time I got?
          (glances up)
     Goddam sand thing drive you crazy.
     Kee-rist. Spelling never was a very
     strong point with me. Even in
     school.

               SHIRLEY 
     If you didn't talk so much, maybe
     you could think more.

               JOE 
     Talking helps. Don't talk, you get
     muddled in your head. Hey! Now you
     just look at this here!

Joe spells out MONY, down from the M in MAN.

               SHIRLEY 
     There's an E in MONEY. If that's
     your word.

               JOE 
     M-O-N-Y -- I'm right! That's just
     exactly how they spell it up there
     on that big building, bet you could
     see it from here. M-O-N-Y.

               SHIRLEY 
          (stifles giggle)
     Okay. Never argue with a man.

               JOE
     Y -- what in hell starts with Y?

Shirley slyly trails the tips of her fingernails across Joe's
chest as she leans over to study the game, breathing softly
into his ear as she speaks.

               SHIRLEY
     It can end in Y day, pay, lay --
     hey, pay lay!

One predatory hand rests on his knee -- as if by accident -
disarranging the sheet, talon nails lightly brushing his
thigh.

               JOE 
     Cut it out. That's cheating,
     teasing me so I can't think.
     Just one bitsy Y word and I gonna
     beat you!

               SHIRLEY 
     You gonna beat me, Joe?

               JOE 
     Beat your butt, you don't lemme
     think!

               SHIRLEY 
     Gay ends in Y. Fey. You like that --
     gay fey -- is that your problem?

               JOE 
     I show you what problem --

But the end of his sentence is swallowed by Shirley, taking
his kiss in her open mouth, crushed by its impact, an animal
noise snarling deep in her throat -- the agonized alley cat
wail of pleasure -- Joe's problem is solved. Joe's love theme
swells triumphant. At the same time, Shirley half-rises,
trying to force Joe's head down, her own on top. The issue is
joined. Shirley has named the game. Her objective is to force
Joe onto his back. Joe's objective is to retain his
initiative. Camera ignores the classic action on the central
front, concentrating exclusively on peripheral tactical
maneuvers...

... Joe's elbows pinning her shoulders...

... her eyes bright, accepting the challenge...

... his tight smile revealing clenched teeth...

... her fingers searching out then tickling his underarm...

... Joe laughing as he falls lopsidedly...

... Shirley laughing triumphantly...

... his hand closing on her wrist...

... her talon-nails clawing the air...

... her toes walking up his calf...

... her legs suddenly locking around his knees...

... her free hand grabbing his hair...

... her shoulder rising as she forces his head back...

... her lips pressing down on his...

... his hand swatting an unidentified mass of flesh...

... her eyes popping, teeth clamping his ear lobe...

... his hand catching her ankle...

... her teeth losing the ear lobe as she screams...

... her foot appearing upside down beside her face...

... her talon-nails furrowing flesh, drawing blood...

... his head rearing back, roaring...

... both rolling to the floor, out of view...

... her feet suddenly flying up into view...

... her hand tugging rhythmically at the blanket...

... her other hand wildly exploring Joe's back...

... her ankles locking spasmodically...

... her eyes and mouth wide, gaping...

... the blanket suddenly ripping free, flying into the air as
her arm flings itself around Joe...

... the bedclothes spilling down around them, muffling her
ascending shrieks.

               JOE'S VOICE
     Whoopee ti yi yo...

INT. SHIRLEY'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Shirley has difficulty reverting to her nine-to-five role as
a Madison Avenue career girl. Half-dressed for work, she is
talking on the telephone, her eyes on the open door to the
bathroom, through which Joe's voice continues singing.

               SHIRLEY
     Well, I really can't talk now, if
     you know what I mean, but believe
     me when I say, Myra, it's an
     experience every emancipated woman
     owes herself. I'm not. I'm not
     exaggerating. Well, what's Phil's
     poker night?
          (yells off)
     Joe -- are you available next
     Thursday, eight-thirty?

INT. SHIRLEY'S BATHROOM - MORNING

Thoroughly shaved, bathed and groomed, Joe is sprinkling an
expensive cologne into his boots. He yells back
enthusiastically.

               JOE 
     Well, lemme think now, Thursday,
     eight-thirty, yeah, I guess I could
     be available. Hell, yeah.

INT. SHIRLEY'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Shirley turns back to the phone. Joe appears, grinning.

               SHIRLEY 
     Why don't you just come here? I'll
     be working every night this week.
     I'll leave a key with the super...

               JOE'S VOICE 
     Well, ma'am -- Shirley -- I sure
     hate to trouble you, but...

Shirley opens her purse, savoring the moment. As she places
the money in Joe's hand...

INT. MEN'S STORE - DAY

... Joe slaps a bill on the counter, admiring a fine new
cowboy shirt in the mirror, wriggling new white socks into
his boots. Suddenly remembering, he goes to the sock rack and
buys two pairs, one large and one small. Gradually
dominating, Joe's love theme recurs, continuing over...

INT. CHAIN DRUG STORE - DAY

... Joe slaps down money to pay for an assortment of
medicine.

INT. CONDEMNED TENEMENT - DAY

Joe takes the stairs two at a time to burst in on...

INT. X FLAT - DAY

... Ratso huddled in the overstuffed chair -- wearing the
stolen sheepskin coat -- wrapped in blankets, his teeth
chattering, in spite of the sweat on his forehead. Joe stops
abruptly, his mood shattered by Ratso's alarming condition.
They simply stare at each other for a moment, then Joe turns
away to see soup heating on the Sterno stove. Joe tosses one
of his paper bags onto Ratso's lap...

               JOE 
     See what you think of that crap.
     I'll pour your soup. Got some of
     that junk you like to swill, too.
     Mentholatum. Aspirin. All that shee
     it...

Ratso opens the paper bag, trying to control his shivering,
pulling out the socks and a suit of long underwear. He sees
Joe watching him for a reaction. The best Ratso can do is a
slight shake of his head.

               JOE (CONT'D)
     They wrong?

               RATSO 
     No. But while you was buying the
     underwear, I could have lifted the
     socks.

               JOE 
     You couldn't lift fly specks from a
     sugar bowl. Can you hold this?

Joe hands Ratso the soup. Ratso seems steadied by the warmth
in his hands. He nods, sipping the soup.

               RATSO
     But thanks.
          (hesitates, then)
     Hey, Joe, don't get sore about this
     or anything. You promise?

               JOE 
     Yeah.

               RATSO 
     Well, I don't think I can walk.
          (embarrassed)
     I mean, I been falling down a lot
     and, uh...

               JOE 
     And what?

               RATSO
     I'm scared.

               JOE 
     What of?

               RATSO 
     What'll happen. I mean what they do
     to, you know, do with you -- if you
     can't -- ah, Christ!

               JOE 
     Who?

               RATSO 
     I don't know. Cops. Or the -- how
     should I know?

Ratso is trembling so violently that the sou, starts to slop
over. Joe takes it and sets it on the table.

               JOE 
     Okay. Here it is. You gonna go see
     the doctor. I got nine bucks and
     twenty more Thursday and I gonna be
     riding high before you know it. So
     you gonna get you the best goddam
     doctor in this town and get
     yourself straightened out, that's
     what.

               RATSO 
     No doctors. No, sir. Not me.
     Doctors are like goddam auto
     mechanics. Fix one-thing, unplug
     another. Operate for piles and
     while they're there, they unscrew
     your liver. My old man, for God's
     sake, wasn't any sicker'n I am when
     he went to the doctor.

               JOE 
     Well, just exactly what the hell
     you think you're gonna do? Die on
     me?

               RATSO 
     I'm going to Florida, that's my
     only chance.

               JOE 
     You know what's wrong with you? You
     got fevers. You kinky as a bedbug.
     How you gonna get to Florida?

               RATSO 
     I'll find the money. If you just
     get me on the bus, that's all I
     ask.

               JOE 
     Just when everything's going my
     way, you gotta pull a stunt like
     this.

               RATSO 
     I don't even want you to go.
     Whaddya think of that? I got other
     plans for my life than dragging
     around some dumb cowboy that thinks
     he's God's gift to women. One
     twenty-buck trick and he's already
     the biggest stud in New York City.
     It's laughable.

Joe sets his Stetson on his head.

               JOE 
     When I put you on that bus down to
     Florida tonight, that'll be the
     happiest day of my life!

INT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

Joe strikes a match with his thumbnail and watches it curl
away while he waits, hearing a phone ring. Then the phone is
answered by a woman's voice.

               JOE 
     Hey, Shirley... Miss who? Oh, yeah,
     well, when will Missus Gardner be
     home? ... I'm a friend of hers, a
     goddam good friend... Shee-it, I
     can't wait till then...

Joe hangs up while the answering service's voice is still
talking. The match has burned out. Joe flips it away.

INSERT

Headline -- WALTER P. BOX TAKES NEW YORK BY SURPRISE.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DUSK

Joe loiters outside a gag headline print shop, his eyes
following a man in homburg and chesterfield.

EXT./INT. METROPOLE - DUSK

Joe lingers momentarily, identifying with the violence in a
jazz drummer, his eyes searching for a pickup.

INT. ARCADE - DUSK

Joe tests his skills in a shoot-down with a large metal
cowboy and kills him, a recorded voice sneaks, "Got me!" as
the cowboy slumps. Joe glances off as he hears polite
applause...

               TOWNY'S VOICE
     Bravo...

... TOWNY -- a stout, round-faced man -- clasps Joe's hand
between both of his own, like an old friend.

               TOWNY 
     How are you?
          (more quietly)
     Townsend P. Locke, from Chicago.
     Call me Towny. I'm here to attend a
     paper manufacturers' convention
     and, frankly, to have a little fun,
     dammit...

Towny grips Joe's elbow, almost forcibly leading him away.

EXT. SIDE STREET WEST OF BROADWAY - DUSK

Towny's face appears huge at Joe's shoulder.

               TOWNY 
     This is my first night in town and
     I'll consider it a ghastly omen
     clouding my entire ten days, if you
     don't consent to have dinner with
     me. Anywhere you like...

Towny's mouth continues speaking at an incredible rate, but
his words are drowned out momentarily by the grinder of a
sanitation truck, chewing up a discarded Christmas tree with
tinsel clinging to it. Towny is still talking when they've
passed the truck.

               TOWNY (CONT'D)
     ... never mind how you're dressed.
     They know me. I'll say you're with
     the rodeo. There's always a rodeo
     in New York, dammit. Besides, you
     look very elegant...

EXT. STREET CORNER - NIGHT

Joe hardly notices O'Daniel on a far cornet, his whining
scarcely audible.
"Ye are the salt of the earth, Jesus said, but if the salt
hath lost its savor, wherewith shall it be salted?"

               TOWNY 
     But, dammit all, I just remembered,
     we'll have to eat in my room
     because I have this phone call
     coming at nine-thirty...

INT. TOWNY'S HOTEL ELEVATOR - NIGHT

An ancient open cage lift.

               TOWNY 
     What I like about you, you're such
     a wonderful conversationalist. So
     won't that be nice to have dinner
     sent up?

INT. TOWNY'S HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

A threadbare, carpeted but spacious hallway.

               TOWNY 
     Fifty years ago this was the only
     hotel in Manhattan. My mother
     always calls me at her bedtime, so
     I've got to be there.

INT. TOWNY'S BEDROOM-SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

The room has little to recommend it except its size and large
French window, through which -- ignored by Joe -- the Mutual
tower flashes MONY. Towny waves Joe toward the couch, quickly
slipping several physical culture magazines from the coffee
table onto a shelf beneath.

               TOWNY 
     A drink? I've got some nice gin. If
     you'd prefer something else,
     they'll send it up...

               JOE
     Gin's okay.

               TOWNY 
     It's so exciting. New York. The mad
     forward thrust of everything. My
     sense of time here is completely
     altered.

INT. TENEMENT STAIRS - DAY

Joe carries Ratso down the stairs, wrapped in a blanket.

INT. TOWNY'S BEDROOM-SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

The coffee table is littered with empty cartons of Chinese
food, soaked through with brown sauce. Joe finds the last egg
roll and eats it as Towny's voice drones on.

               TOWNY 
     Sometimes it seems to me time
     stopped twenty years ago. There was
     this war, there was this handsome
     young man with quite black hair and
     he was supposed to die. But he
     didn't. Isn't that amusing?

               JOE 
     What?

Towny's dialogue moves out of sync. Towny's eyes seem to look
into camera -- from Joe's viewpoint -- but slightly past it.
The quality of the scene grows increasingly disjointed as Joe
glances around the room, looking for something to steal,
losing personal contact with Towny, viewing him as an object
to be used for a specific purpose.

               TOWNY 
     Enough about me. I'm through
     talking for the evening. Now I want
     to hear about conditions in the
     West. The romance of the West holds
     a tremendous power over me. Mother
     was actually a pioneer woman, can
     you believe it? When she calls,
     I'll introduce you and she'll be so
     thrilled.

EXT. TENEMENT NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

Ratso sits an a stoop while Joe hails a cab.

INT. TOWNY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

Towny's voice is only a shrill monotone from here, Joe
searches with increasing desperation for something of value.
An old electric razor is too bulky for Joe's pocket, probably
worthless anyhow. Towny's array of medicines merely recalls
Joe's purpose.

               TOWNY'S VOICE 
     Mama, a coincidence. Guess who was
     being discussed. Discussed. Not
     disgusted. Discussed! Do you have
     that thing turned up? Why aren't
     you wearing it! This is impossible!

EXT. GREYHOUND BUS TERMINAL - DAY

Joe lifts Ratso from the taxi and carries him inside.

               JOE'S VOICE 
     Listen, Towny, did I mention I got
     a sick kid?

INT. TOWNY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

Joe is rehearsing the speech in the bathroom mirror.

               JOE 
     Well, he is, he's sicker'n shee-it.
     And I've gotta get him South quick
     as I can...

INT. GREYHOUND BUS TERMINAL - DAY

Joe stands in a long line, glancing impatiently at the clock
while Ratso waits on a bench, wrapped in his blanket.

INT. TOWNY'S BEDROOM-SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

Towny is stretched out on the couch, staring morosely.

               TOWNY 
     I was so childish with her.

Joe moves into frame past camera, standing in front of him,
so that we can see the scene from behind Joe's waist.

               JOE 
     What d'you want?

               TOWNY 
     What?

               JOE 
     What you got me up here for?

               TOWNY 
     Oh, difficult, it's so difficult.
     You're a nice person, Joe -- I
     should never have asked you up -- a
     lovely person. Oh, how I loathe
     life. I loathe it. Please go.
     Please.

               JOE 
     You want me to leave?

               TOWNY 
     No, yes. No, I mean yes please go.
     Help me to be good. Come back
     tomorrow. Promise.

               JOE
     I'm going to Florida.

               TOWNY 
     This is terrible. I meet someone
     who -- then -- wait, I want to give
     you a present. For your trip.
     You'll let me please...

INT. GREYHOUND BUS TERMINAL - DAY

Joe's face is expectant, next in line at the ticket window.
He nods reassuringly toward Ratso.

INT. TOWNY'S BEDROOM-SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

Joe's face is puzzled then angry as Towny takes a Saint
Christopher medal from his sack and hands it to Joe. His eyes
are looking past Joe, his speech out of sync.

               TOWNY 
     Please take it. You don't have to
     be Catholic. Saint Christopher is
     the patron saint of all travelers.
     I want you to have it. For helping
     me be good.

INT. GREYHOUND BUS TERMINAL - DAY

It's Joe's turn. The clerk looks at him expectantly.

INT. TOWNY'S BEDROOM-SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

Joe's voice is angry.

               JOE 
     Listen, I gotta have money.

               TOWNY 
     Oh. Yes. Of course. I should have
     thought. You shouldn't have to ask.
     That was thoughtless of me. Yes.
     Wait here...

Towny hurries across the room to the bedside table. Beside
the telephone is a picture of a prosperous pioneer woman
wearing a hearing-aid.
Towny tries to conceal his movements as he takes a wallet
from the drawer, lifts out a bill and tucks the wallet back
and turns -- terrified to see Joe close behind him -- almost
knocking the lamp off the table in his fright. Pressed
against the table, protecting but calling attention to his
wallet, Towny holds out the bill.

               TOWNY (CONT'D)
     Here. Don't even thank me.

               JOE
          (takes the bill)
     I gotta have more'n ten. I gotta
     have fifty-seven dollars.

               TOWNY
     I simply don't have it, Joe.

               JOE
     Get outta my way.

               TOWNY 
     You're wasting your time. There's
     nothing in there.

Towny clutches the table, staring at Joe, shaking his head
like a bad little boy. Joe backhands him angrily. Trying to
duck the blow, Towny stumbles and slips to the floor, but
grabs the table in his arms, watching Joe out of the corner
of his eyes, whimpering. Joe grabs his hair, turning his face
up.

               JOE 
     Let go. Let go of the table.

Joe slaps him, but Towny clings more fiercely to the table as
Joe tries to jerk it free. Joe strikes him with his fist.

               TOWNY 
     I deserved that, I know I did.

But he clutches the table wildly. His mother's picture falls
unnoticed. Joe stands in panic, sickened, unable to fulfill
the role Towny has assigned him.

               TOWNY (CONT'D)
     I brought this on myself. I'm
     bleeding, my nose is bleeding,
     isn't it?

Towny's eyes shine, teeth clenched in a crazy smile, blood
trickling from his nose. Suddenly Joe jerks the lamp free of
its socket.

               JOE 
     You wanna gimme fifty-seven dollars
     or you wanna busted skull?

Towny simply stares at the lamp.

               JOE (CONT'D)
     Please let go of that table.

Joe threatens, swings the lamp down, but stops short of
hitting Towny. Towny shrieks -- eyes rolling back as he falls
limp -- loosing his grip on the table, leaning on the bed,
laughing and crying hysterically. Joe has to step over him to
reach the wallet in the drawer. He takes all the money --
probably twice what he needs -- desperate to get out of the
room.

INT. GREYHOUND BUS TERMINAL - DAY

Joe carries Ratso up the steps onto the bus.

INT. TOWNY'S BEDROOM-SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

Towny's shrill little whisper says...

               TOWNY 
     Thank you, Joe.

... provoking Joe to glance back. Towny is reaching for the
telephone, his eyes on Joe with wild brightness, holding his
hand on the receiver. Joe knocks the phone from his hand,
hits Towny in the mouth, jerks the cord from the wall as
Towny falls -- gagging -- finally dislodging his dentures on
the carpet. Joe stands sick and confused, holding the useless
phone in two hands...

EXT. GREYHOUND BUS TERMINAL - DAY

The bus driver revs the powerful engine, shifting gears.

INT. TOWNY'S BEDROOM-SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

... Joe is about to hang the dead receiver on its hook when 
on sudden impulse -- he shoves the small end of the receiver
into the toothless mouth of the man on the floor.

EXT. LINCOLN TUNNEL - DAY

The bus roars into the tunnel.

INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY

Joe and Ratso sit near the rear of the bus. Ratso's teeth
chatter, wrapped in the blanket.

               RATSO 
     Thirty-one hours.

They ride a few moments in silence.

               RATSO (CONT'D)
     The trip is. Nine-thirty in the
     morning we get there. Not this
     morning but the next one at nine
     thirty.

Both nod for a moment in silence.

               JOE 
     These guys're good drivers.

               RATSO 
     They gotta be.

               JOE 
     Yeah.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The bus tires sing as it speeds South.

INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY

Joe and Ratso have reversed places, putting Ratso by the
window. Joe watches a middle-aged couple try on their new
straw hats, unaware that Joe is watching them.

               RATSO 
     You get your first palm tree in
     South Carolina.

               JOE 
     How'n hell a dumb Bronx kid like
     you know that?

               RATSO 
     I read it.

               JOE
     Shee-it. You believe all you read?

EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

The metal grating rings as the bus soars onto it.

INT. GREYHOUND BUS - NIGHT

Two aging young ladies in brand-new resort wear are casually
examining Joe, along with the other men on the bus, but Joe
is frowning at Ratso, who shivers despite the bright sun.

               JOE 
     If you have to shiver, why don't
     you pull the blanket up more?

               RATSO 
     I been thinking. I hope we're not
     gonna have a lotta trouble about my
     name down there. Because like
     what's the whole point of this trip
     anyway?

               JOE 
     Keep the goddam blanket on.

               RATSO 
     I mean New York's one thing, but
     can you see this guy, imagine it,
     running around the goddam beach all
     suntan and he's going in swimming,
     like, and then somebody yells 'Hey,
     Ratso' -- how does that sound to
     you?

               JOE 
     Sounds like they knew you.

               RATSO 
     Sounds like crap, admit it. And I'm
     not gonna have it. I'm Rico all the
     time, okay, do you blame me? That's
     agreed, okay? We're gonna tell all
     these new people my name's Rico?

Joe nods. Ratso closes his eyes, momentarily at peace.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAWN

The bus passes a Florida hotel sign too swiftly to read it.

INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAWN

Joe frowns in his sleep, awakens, lifts his Stetson to see
Ratso wide awake, in misery, wiping tears from his eyes.

               JOE
     Hey -- whatsa matter?

               RATSO
          (barely audible)
     I'm wet.

               JOE 
     You're what?

               RATSO 
     I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.

               JOE 
     Hell, don't cry about it!

               RATSO 
     Here I am going to Florida and my
     leg hurts, my butt hurts, my chest
     hurts, my face hurts, and like that
     ain't enough, I gotta pee all over
     myself.

Joe laughs suddenly, uncontrollably.

               RATSO (CONT'D)
     I'm falling apart, that's funny?

               JOE
          (nods, laughing)
     You just -- just -- what happened,
     you just had a little rest stop
     wasn't on the schedule.

Ratso begins to laugh with Joe as if it were the funniest
thing they'd ever heard. Then Ratso's face pales as he starts
to choke and cough. Joe pats him on the back.

               JOE (CONT'D)
     Hey, what size pants you wear?

EXT. SMALL TOWN STREET - DAY

The bus is parked in the distance. Joe comes from a clothing
store, bare-headed, wearing plain slacks and sport-shirt. He
carries the boots, Stetson and cowboy suit in one hand, a
bundle under his arm. He dumps his cowboy regalia in the
trash bin of a sandwich stand and calls to the WAITRESS.

               JOE
     Couple crullers'n coffee to go.

The Waitress draws coffee, wraps crullers.

               WAITRESS
     Where you from?

               JOE
     New York.

Joe pays. She smiles, gives him change. Joe smiles, starts on
toward the bus, hardly aware that he has accomplished
something rare and remarkable for Joe -- a simple human
contact without fear or threat, a pleasant everyday
happening.

INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY

Joe and Ratso have moved to the seat farthest back, wider
than the others. Joe blocks the view of the other passengers
as he helps Ratso into a new pair of corduroy pants and a
Florida shirt. In the middle of the operation, Ratso dozes
off. Joe shakes his head, scowling, annoyed, but continues,
lifting Ratso enough to slide the pants around his waist.
Ratso awakens as Joe zips the fly.

               RATSO 
     Hey, what the hell you doing?

               JOE 
     I'm zipping your fly, what the hell
     you think I'm doing?

They both smile. It isn't funny enough to laugh at. Joe
arranges the blanket, takes out a package of cigarettes,
glances at Ratso and puts it away.

EXT. TRAVELING SHOT WITH BUS - DAY

Palm trees are streaking past the window. The sun is glaring
hot. A group of kids in bare feet and straw hats wave to the
bus as it passes.

INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY

Ratso's eyes squint in a dazed half-sleep. Joe leans across
to pull down the shade. He hesitates a moment, watching...

... past his reflection, a group of young men on their way to
work, carrying lunch pails, dressed exactly as Joe is now
dressed...

... then Joe lowers the blind and seats himself. Ratso nods
slightly, his voice practically inaudible.

               RATSO 
     Thanks, Joe.

               JOE 
     Shee-it, you know, I got this thing
     all figured out, Ratso. I mean
     Rico. When we get to Miami, what
     I'll do, I'll go to work. I gotta
     do that, 'cause see, I ain't no
     kind of a hustler. I ain't even any
     goddam good as a bum. I'm a
     nothing, that's what I am. So
     reckon I'd better go to work and
     get me a goddam job. Okay?

Joe glances at Ratso, but there is no response.
Surreptitiously, Joe takes out a cigarette, turns his face
away from Ratso and lights it, hiding it cupped in his hand
as he smokes.

               JOE (CONT'D)
     Yeah, guess that's what I'm gonna
     do.

They ride for a moment in semi-darkness, Joe smoking, looking
at the other people on the bus, brighter without the shades
down. Joe turns, checking the blanket around Ratso, noticing
that Ratso is sitting in a peculiarly stiff, awkward
position. Joe leans over to straighten Ratso's head, blocking
our view for a moment. Then Joe leans back, frowning,
thoughtful. We still do not see Ratso's face. Joe rises
slowly, starting forward in the bus...

... passing an older couple, a schoolgirl, two ladies with
straw hats, a young man trying to read, pausing when he
reaches...

... the DRIVER, staring out at the Sunshine Parkway with the
Driver, leaning over so he won't have to speak too loudly.

               DRIVER
     Yes, sir?

               JOE,
     My friend's dead in the back seat.

               DRIVER
     Your friend's what in the back
     seat?

               JOE
     Dead. Dead as a doornail.

               DRIVER
     Is this some kind of...

He glances at Joe, then pulls off the road and stands up.

               DRIVER (CONT'D)
     Okay, folks, everything's fine.
     Nothing to worry about.

The passengers crane their necks as Joe follows the Driver to
the rear of the bus. The passengers at the rear are staring
ahead, trying not to see what is going on. The Driver touches
Ratso, straightens, touches his hat, but doesn't remove it.

               DRIVER (CONT'D)
     Is he kin to you?

Joe nods no.

               DRIVER (CONT'D)
     Don't you want to close his eyes?

               JOE
     Close them?

               DRIVER 
     Just reach over and close them.
     That's all.

Joe closes Ratso's eyes.

               DRIVER (CONT'D)
     I guess we'll just drive on, right?
     Nothing else to do.

               JOE 
     No, sir. Not till Miami. I'll see
     to burying then.

The Driver moves to the front and turns to the passengers.

               DRIVER
     Just a little sickness, folks,
     nothing serious. We'll be in
     Miami...
          (looks at watch)
     ... in forty minutes.

INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY

Joe sits stiffly, very frightened, as the bus starts on. Then
he glances at Ratso, frowning, reaches out an arm and puts it
around Ratso, settling back, staring straight ahead.

                      THE END
