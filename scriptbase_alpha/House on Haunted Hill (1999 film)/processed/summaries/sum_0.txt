When an eccentric millionaire offer a group of opposites $1,000,000 to spend the night in a so called "Haunted House" with a murderous past, they figure it is a quick way to get quick money and leave.
All of them are sure it is some made up story just to mess with their heads a little and test their courage.
But, once they stay in the house they start to think about the mistake they made in coming there when mysterious things start to happen.
