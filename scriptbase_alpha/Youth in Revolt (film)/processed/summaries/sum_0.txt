At 16, Nick Twisp is wry about his teen funk: he lives in Oakland with his sex-addled mother; his father's child support is her meal ticket.
While camping in Ukiah, Nick meets Sheeni: for him, it's love at first sight.
Nick has to figure out how to get his father a job in Ukiah, then how to get sent to live with his father, then how to get close to Sheeni, whose religious parents may want her sent away from temptation to a boarding school.
There's also Sheeni's all-American boyfriend to contend with.
Overwhelmed by the challenges, Nick's about to give up when he conjures an alter ego who whispers revolt into his ear.
Nick is not altogether hapless, but can this end well?
