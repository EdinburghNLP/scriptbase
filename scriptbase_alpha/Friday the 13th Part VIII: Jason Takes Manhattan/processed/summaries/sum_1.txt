A whole high senior class is finally graduating.
For that, they get into a luxury cruise called ''Lazarus''.
At the beginning they are all having fun, including our main heroine ''Rennie'' who has a serious problem with the water because of past traumatic events '' Almost got drowned when she was little''.
When we get to see all the young teenagers our friend Jason who got on board the ship starts with his killing rampage until we get to see only the main characters of the movie.. After that, they decide to look for the killer and kill him...
Unfortunately, Jason got them first... After only a few of them escaped and got off the ship reached N.Y where they now have a bigger problem.
Jason managed to get there too!
He's cashing the survivors so he can kill them.
Now the young teenager couple must escape or die in the dark waters of New York.
