The graduating class of the local high school is going on a luxury cruise with Jason Voorhees as a stowaway.
The heroine Rennie Wickham believes she was almost drowned by Jason as a child.
Jason eventually sinks the boat and kills many of the students on it, but many of them escape to Manhattan.
A long battle with Jason ensues until Jason is washed away in the New York sewers by a midnight flooding of toxic waste.
