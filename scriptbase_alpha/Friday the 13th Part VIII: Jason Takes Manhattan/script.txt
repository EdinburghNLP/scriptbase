FRIDAY THE 13TH PART VIII: JASON TAKES MANHATTAN



     FRIDAY THE 13TH PART VIII: JASON TAKES MANHATTAN

     Written by Rob Hedden


     FADE IN:

     EXT. CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT

     A dark, rumbling sky. Haze clings to the lake as we float 
     across it, clearing to bring the opposite shoreline into 
     view. A few scattered streetlights. Dilapidated cabins. 
     An abandoned campsite. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE. 

     We continue to drift towards it, hearing the faint sound 
     of seductive music and an occasional giggle. A small 
     HOUSEBOAT floats into our foreground, its interior light 
     flickering as TWO BODIES move around inside.

     INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

     A teenage boy and girl, JIM and SUZY, are slow-dancing. 
     Jim's lips softly touch her lissome shoulders.

                    JIM
          Well...how do you feel?

                    SUZY
          Ask me in about five minutes.

     She bites his ear, giggles, then kisses him fully..

                    JIM
          I'm talking about graduation. Being 
          totally free to do whatever we want 
          now.

     Her hands slip inside his Pendleton shirt. He sighs.

                    SUZY
          It feels excellent.

     Her mouth finds his again. After a long kiss, he gently 
     pulls away from her with a teasing smile.

                    JIM
          Gotta throw the anchor over.

     He leaves the cabin. She slips under the bed sheets.

     EXT. HOUSEBOAT DECK - NIGHT

     as Jim tosses a small anchor overboard.

     TIGHT ON WATER SURFACE

     as the weighty object splashes, sinking into black 
     oblivion, pulling its cable down with it. 

     JIM 

     glances at the lake, at their eerie surroundings. He 
     feels a chill, heading back inside.

     EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)

     as the anchor drifts to the lake bottom, dropping a few 
     feet from a THICK POWER CABLE which rests in the lake 
     silt.

     INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

     as Jim returns with an uneasy expression. He crawls on 
     top of the bed, kissing her again, but not with the same 
     enthusiasm as before.

                    SUZY
          What's wrong?

                    JIM
          Nothing.

     He starts to pull off his shirt and join her. She senses 
     his anxiety.

                    SUZY
          C'mon, Jimmy. Something's bothering 
          you.

     Jim pauses, turning off the mood music.

                    JIM
          It's just that we're right around that 
          old summer camp where all those 
          murders took place.

     The boat creaks. She's instantly nervous.

                    SUZY
          What murders?

                    JIM
          Never mind, you don't want to know 
          about it.

                    SUZY
          Tell me.

                    JIM
          There's nothing to worry about, Suzy. 
          The guy's dead now, somewhere at the 
          bottom of this lake...if you believe 
          the stories.
               (beat)
          Let's drop it, okay?

     He starts to kiss her again. She stops him.

                    SUZY
          What stories?

     He doesn't want to go into it but Suzy's face insists.

                    JIM
          There was this boy named Jason 
          Voorhees who drowned in Crystal 
          Lake...

     FLASHBACK

     Eight year old JASON is desperately trying to tread 
     water, flailing his arms like a marionette to get 
     attention as he gulps down gallons of mossy lake water.

                    YOUNG JASON
          Hhhhelp....me....I'm drowning...

                    JIM (V.O.)
          None of the counselors heard him.

                    YOUNG JASON
          Mmmmmmommy....

     ...And Jason finally slips under the surface for good.

     INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

                    JIM
          A bunch of years went by and everybody 
          forgot about it.
               (beat)
          That's when the murders started.

     FLASHBACK MONTAGE (STOCK)

     as our senses are bombarded with QUICK CUTS of assorted

     teenagers just about to die, their screams echoing over 
     each other. We do not see the attacker. As the 
     cacophony reaches a screeching crescendo, CUT BACK TO:

     INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

     as the silence hits us hard again.

                    SUZY
          Jason did it...?

                    JIM'
          That's what some people thought. But 
          they were wrong.

     FLASHBACK (STOCK)

     as MRS. VOORHEES comes directly at camera wielding a huge 
     knife and a primal scream.

     INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

                    JIM
          His mother blamed the counselors for 
          his death and tried to kill them all.
               (dramatic pause)
          She got her head chopped off by one of 
          them.

     We don't need to see this clip...Suzy's reaction is quite 
     sufficient.

                    SUZY
          So the murders stopped?

     He gives her a long, penetrating look.

                    JIM
          No.

     FLASHBACK MONTAGE (STOCK)

     We're bombarded with QUICK FLASHES of a hockey masked 
     JASON wreaking havoc on assorted teenagers...brandishing 
     everything from hatchets to knives to chainsaws. Just as 
     Jason is about to stab us, CUT BACK TO:

     INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

     Suzy flinches as if she were getting the knife.

                    

                    JIM
          Legend has it that Jason came back to 
          avenge his mother's death, vowing to 
          kill every teenager from the area. 
               (beat)
          And every now and then, the murders 
          start up again. 

     The boat lurches slightly, tugging at the anchor cable. 
     She's scared: he's frightened himself a little, too.

                    JIM
          Forget about it, Suzy. They're just 
          stories.

     He brushes her hair back, kissing her cheek gently, 
     finding the nape of her neck again. She closes her eyes, 
     trying to dismiss what he's dredged up. But she can't. 
     Suzy begins to rationalize.

                    SUZY
          We're the last graduating class, 
          right? 

     Jim's kissing her body, putting Jason behind him.

                    JIM
          Right.

                    SUZY
          I mean, Lakeview High just closed its 
          doors for good, right?

                    JIM
          Right.

                    SUZY
          So there's no reason for him to come 
          back because there won't be any of us 
          around...right?

     Jim stops, looking her squarely in the eyes.

                    JIM
          Right. Except that Jason isn't real 
          so none of it matters anyway.

     She starts to relax, returning his kisses.

     EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)

     as the anchor drifts along the lake floor, tugging hard 
     on the power cable. Camera TRACKS along the cable, 
     coming to a RUSTY SET OF CHAINS TANGLED AROUND IT.

     INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

     as Jim slides on top of Suzy. Thoughts of Jason are 
     starting to slip away along with their clothes.

     EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)

     as the chains emit a dull tinkle due to movement from the 
     tugging anchor. Camera continues to TRACK again...and we 
     find to our horror that the waterlogged, fish-eaten body 
     of JASON IS SECURED BY THESE SAME CHAINS. (NOTE: Jason's 
     face is obscured.)

     INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

     Teenagers in love, lost in not-so-innocent passion. At 
     the same moment:

     EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)

     The anchor tugs one last time and RIPS THROUGH THE CABLE. 
     SPARKS INSTANTLY FLY, chasing along the cable, finding 
     the chain which secures Jason and ENGULFING HIM IN 
     ELECTRICITY.

     EXT. HOUSEBOAT - ON LAKE SURFACE (EFX)

     as BRIGHT FLASHES OF BLUE LIGHT strobe-under the surface. 
     ARCING CURRENT chases up the anchor cable, sparking 
     across the hoist.

     EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - WIDE SHOT FROM WATER

     as the electricity feeding the streetlights is abruptly 
     extinguished, plunging the campsite into darkness.

     INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

     as Suzy's eyes flash open.

                    SUZY
          Did you hear that?

                    JIM
          Hear what?

     He pulls her back down.

                    SUZY
          C'mon, I'm serious.

     He knows the mood is broken.

                    JIM
          All right, I'll check it out.

     He slips on his jeans, exiting the cabin. She pulls the 
     sheet up around her fearfully.

     EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)

     as the cable smolders, void of electricity now. TRACK to 
     find the chains again...but they're dangling loosely. 
     JASON IS GONE.

     INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

     Suzy is tensely kneeling on the bed now. The black void 
     of night is all she sees out the cabin door, which Jim 
     has left open. An uncomfortable amount of time passes.

                    SUZY
          Jimmy...?

     No answer. Her heart starts to pound.

                    SUZY
          Jim...?

     Again, nothing. She wraps herself in the sheet, moving 
     towards the open door. The ship creaks again.

     SUZY'S POINT OF VIEW

     as she grows closer to the doorway, nothing but pitch-
     black beyond it.

                    SUZY
          Stop screwing around, Jim. I mean 
          it...

     ...And just as she reaches the door:

     A HOCKEY MASKED MONSTER

     leaps out, clutching a HUGE KNIFE. Suzy barely has time 
     to scream before JASON PLUNGES THE KNIFE INTO HER CHEST.

     SUZY

     stands there in speechless shock, looking down at her 
     mortal wound. But there's no blood.

     THE MONSTER

     pulls the knife back out, pushing the blade in and out 
     with his hand. It's a retractable rubber knife. JIM 
     pulls off the hockey mask with a huge grin, tossing it 
     aside.

                    JIM
          Gotcha good, baby cakes.

     She doesn't know whether to hug him with relief or kick 
     him in the balls. He pulls her back onto the bed, 
     laughing.

     EXT. HOUSEBOAT - CLOSE ON HOCKEY MASK

     sitting dormant on the deck, where Jim tossed it. A 
     SHADOW FALLS ACROSS IT...followed by a SLIMY, DECOMPOSING 
     HAND. The hand grabs it like it's an old friend, pulling 
     it away.

     INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

     as Jim holds his angry girlfriend down on the bed, trying 
     unsuccessfully to kiss her.

                    JIM
          All right, all right -- I'm a major 
          ass.

                    SUZY
          And you'll never do it again.

                    JIM
          And I'll never do it again. Forgive 
          me?

                    SUZY
          No.

     She's resisting only for effect. Her legs curl around 
     him, finally giving in.

     EXT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

     A deadly-sharp SPEAR GUN rests in its rack outside the 
     cabin. JASON'S HAND REMOVES IT.

     INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

     The sheets begin to roll like waves as they work each 
     other. Thoughts of Jason are nonexistent now.

     ANGLE - CABIN DOOR

     Nothing there for a moment...then a pair of moss-covered 
     BARE FEET SLOSH INTO FRAME.

     SUZY

     closes her eyes with pleasure...

     ANGLE - CABIN DOOR

     ...and camera RISES from the mossy feet, up the bloodless 
     legs and torso to ultimately reveal the hockey-masked 
     face of our anti-hero: JASON VOORHEES.

     SUZY 

     lets out a broad smile, her eyelids fluttering. They stay 
     open long enough to regard the visitor in the doorway. 
     She tries to choke out a warning to Jim, who's just 
     collapsed himself.

                    SUZY
          JJJJJJJJason...

     He doesn't follow her glance, smiling instead.

                    JIM
          Uh-huh. You must really think I'm an 
          ass.

     But she continues to stare in horror as:

     JASON

     raises the spear, taking aim.

     ANGLE - SUZY AND JIM  

     Hs starts to kiss her but she bolts up with a blood-
     curdling SCREAM. A second later, JASON FIRES THE SPEAR, 
     PIERCING HER NECK, PINNING HER TO THE HEAD BOARD.

     Jim stares point-blank at his dead girlfriend, not able 
     to assimilate it quickly enough. He spins around to see 
     the monster himself.

                    JIM
          Ohmygod...

     Jim springs off the bed, looking around for anything to 
     defend himself with, grabbing the bedside lamp. He 
     SMASHES IT OVER JASON'S HEAD which has little effect. Jim 
     scrambles to get past him, but Jason LIFTS JIM IN THE 
     AIR, SLAMMING HIM DOWN ON ONE OF THE SPIKED BEDPOSTS.

     EXT. CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT

     as the HOUSEBOAT silently drifts onward. The lone 
     silhouette of Jason emerges from within, taking the helm. 
     He's back.

                                     FADE OUT/MAIN CREDITS.

     FADE IN:

     EXT. HARBOR - ESTABLISHING - DAY

     Only the faintest sign of daylight can be seen through a 
     thick blanket of gray fog. In the distance, speckled 
     lights outlining a smaller LUXURY CRUISE SHIP 
     intermittently appear.

     EXT. DOCKSIDE - DAY

     Standing at the boarding ramp is CHARLES MCCULLOCH, 
     clipboard in hand. He's just finished checking off a pair 
     of new-agey SENIOR GIRLS. McCulloch is approaching fifty, 
     wearing a tie and unwrinkled clothes, as well as the 
     disposition of a stern puritan.

                    MCCULLOCH
          Remember girls, the shuffleboard 
          tournament will start at six p.m. 
          sharp. A non-attendance will restrict 
          your time in port, understood?

     They nod for his benefit, exchanging derogatory whispers 
     as they head up the ramp. Camera ADJUSTS to find a small 
     parking lot adjacent to the docks, where several cars are 
     just now arriving -- parents dropping off their high 
     school seniors, hugging them bon voyage.

     CLOSER ANGLE PARKING LOT

     as SEAN ROBERTSON walks toward the ship with pal MILES 
     WOLFE. Sean's a tall, nice looking, somewhat serious guy; 
     Miles is shorter, athletic and more extroverted.

                    MILES
          You're telling me this boat has a pool 
          with a three meter board?

                    SEAN
          It's a ship and that's right. Plus a 
          disco, gym, game room and a lot more.

                    MILES
          I think I'm gonna blow off New York 
          and just stay on this thing.

                    MCCULLOCH
          You'll do no such thing, Mr. Wolfe... 

     Camera ADJUSTS to reveal McCulloch, holding his list, 
     checking off their names.

                    MCCULLOCH
          Your itinerary has been carefully 
          planned and make no mistake, it will 
          be executed accordingly.

                    MILES
               (under his breath)
          Of course...wouldn't want to risk 
          enjoying this trip.

     McCulloch gives him a frown. Sean steps up to him 
     tentatively.

                    SEAN
          Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. 
          McCulloch?

                    MCCULLOCH
          Rennie's not coming.

     He's devastated.

                    SEAN
          But I thought...

                    MCCULLOCH
          She changed her mind.
               (eyeing list)
          Let's see...Mr. Wolfe is in stateroom 
          one-eleven and you, Mr. Robertson, are 
          in two-twenty-five.

     A booming VOICE from above interrupts them:

                    ADMIRAL ROBERTSON (O.S.)
          Sean -- where the hell have you been? 
          We're already into early departure 
          protocol...

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     Standing on the upper deck is a no-nonsense, uniformed 
     Navy man, ADMIRAL ROBERTSON. The captain of the ship. And 
     Sean's father. Sean's sadness about Rennie's absence is 
     immediately replaced with anxiety.

                    SEAN
          Be right up, Dad.

     He and Miles head up the gangway, both boys giving 
     McCulloch one last glare.

     INT. '76 BMW 2002 - DAY

     Behind the wheel is MISS COLLEEN VAN DEUSEN, thirties, 
     attractive, a progressive attitude. RENNIE WICKHAM sits 
     next to her -- she's seventeen, pretty, slightly 
     withdrawn. Rennie's dog TOBY, a border collie, rides in 
     the back seat.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          I'm glad you decided to come after 
          all.

                    RENNIE
          Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles 
          will be.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          You let me worry about him, okay?
               (pause)
          Personal experiences are what fuel the 
          minds of great writers, Rennie. You 
          made the right decision.

                    RENNIE
          What about not-so-great writers?

     Rennie smiles self-deprecatingly, Miss Van Deusen 
     grinning back. But Rennie's smiles are few and far 
     between, this one disappearing as she glances out the 
     window.

     RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (SECOND UNIT)

     as the countless gallons of harbor and lake water spread 
     out before her, eery in the bog. A small ROWBOAT grazes 
     across it occupied by two indistinguishable people.

     RETURN TO SHOT

     Rennie's eyes show a hidden terror. She quickly turns 
     away, shivering briefly. Miss Van Deusen notices. She 
     turns a corner, heading into the parking lot.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          Everything okay?

                    RENNIE
          Just felt a little chill.

     Rennie rubs her arms, faking coldness.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          Did you know that I'm giving up 
          teaching?

                    RENNIE
          Really?

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          Since the school is closing anyway, 
          I'm going to write that novel I've 
          been threatening on everybody.

                    RENNIE
          That's wonderful, Miss Van 
          Deusen...what's it about?

     She parks the car, turning off the ignition.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          A senior class cruise to Manhattan, 
          laced with romance, adventure and 
          murder.
               (beat)
          Or a Gothic cook book. I haven't 
          decided which.

     She's coaxed the smile out of Rennie again. Miss Van 
     Deusen pulls a small wrapped box from her glove 
     compartment, handing it to Rennie, who seems utterly 
     surprised.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          Go on, open it.

     Rennie pops off the lid, revealing an antique ink-dip 
     pen.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          Stephen King supposedly used it when 
          he was in high school.

                    RENNIE
          I don't know what to say...

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          Rennie, you're the best student I ever 
          had...you have a real gift. If anybody 
          can make use of that pen, it's you.

     Rennie hugs her teacher. Camera RISES above the car's 
     window, finding a Mercedes 560 SL pulling in a short 
     distance away.

     CLOSER ANGLE - MERCEDES

     A sexy, money-dressed blonde is behind the wheel. TAMARA 
     MASON. She climbs from her leather seats as a trio of 
     SENIOR GIRLS walk by, offering enthusiastic hi's and 
     hellos. She's obviously Miss Popular. Tamara crosses to a 
     cute Japanese girl unloading luggage from a beige Honda, 
     EVA WATANABE.

                    . TAMARA
          Are you ready for drugs, sex and rock 
          'n roll or what, girl?

     Eva gives her a warning glance, nodding to her left. 
     Eva's MOTHER appears by the passenger door, forcing a 
     smile at Tamara.

                    MRS. WATANABE
          Hello, Tamara.

                    TAMARA
          Hi, Mrs. Watanabe. Just kidding.

                    MRS. WATANABE
          Yes, I'm sure.

     Embarrassed, Eva hurries to her Mom, rushing a kiss 
     goodbye.

                    EVA
          Don't worry about a thing, Mom. I'll 
          have a terrific time and I won't do 
          anything stupid, okay?

     Before Mrs. Watanabe can squeeze a word in, her daughter 
     is gone. She waves a bittersweet goodbye to her graduate.

                    MRS. WATANABE
          I love you...

     TRACKING WITH TAMARA AND EVA

     Once they're out of Mrs. Watanabe's earshot --

                    TAMARA
          I hear the crew members are cute guys 
          in their twenties.

                    EVA
          Really?

                    TAMARA
          I'm sure we'll have no problem getting 
          them to party with us...especially 
          with this.

     Tamara unzips her purse, revealing a baggie filled with 
     fine white powder. Eva looks very nervous.

                    TAMARA
          It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It 
          cost over a thousand bucks but it's 
          the best.

                    EVA
          He bought you that?

                    TAMARA
          More or less. It's part of my college 
          fund.

                    

     She grins coquettishly, walking on. Camera HOLDS on the 
     calm, foggy harbor...where the faint image of a HOUSEBOAT 
     is aimlessly drifting into port.

     CLOSER ANGLE - HOUSEBOAT

     Sure enough, it's the same one we saw JASON on last 
     night...but no one is behind the helm. It seems to be a 
     ghost ship.

     EXT. DOCKSIDE - DAY

     as Tamara tries to slip past McCulloch, busy with another 
     pair of seniors.

                    MCCULLOCH
          You can stop right there, Miss Mason.

     He motions the others onward. Busted. Tamara instantly 
     hands Eva her drug-filled purse, paralyzing Eva.

                    MCCULL40CH
          Only graduating seniors are allowed on 
          this cruise.

                    TAMARA
          What are you talking about?

                    MCCULLOCB
          You never turned in your final biology 
          project, so I've had your diploma 
          rescinded.

                    TAMARA
          You can't do that...

                    MCCULLOCH
          It's already been done.
               (turning to Eva)
          Congratulations on the 3.9 average, 
          Miss Watanabe. You're in stateroom two-
          fifty-five.

     Eva smiles awkwardly, reaching for her luggage, stalling 
     to see what happens with Tamara.

                    TAMARA
          Look, Mr. McCulloch, I got in a car 
          accident yesterday and missed our 
          appointment. It's okay, no big deal, 
          just a bruised arm...
               (squeezes her arm)
          ...so I brought my project along 
          today. It's in my suitcase. Really.

     He looks at her suitcase, not buying a word of this.

                    EVA
          She's telling the truth, Mr. 
          McCulloch. I saw her pack it.

     He's surprised to hear this...and so is Tamara.

                    MCCULLOCH
          All right. But if it mysteriously 
          disappears en route, I'll have you 
          sent back home the minute we dock. 
          Understood?

                    TAMARA
          Perfectly.

     She grabs her purse back from Eva, quickly moving on 
     before he changes his mind. Their voices become whispers.

                    TAMARA  
          A major prick.

                    EVA
          What are you going to do?

                    TAMARA
          Improvise, of course.

     EXT. DOCK PILINGS - SAME TIME  

     as the HOUSEBOAT haphazardly bumps into barnacle-covered 
     dock pilings, still around fifty yards from the cruise 
     ship.

     POINT OF VIEW OUT HOUSEBOAT WINDOW

     The window is splattered with blood, but still clear 
     enough to make out Tamara and Eva walking up the gangway, 
     along with a half dozen other teenagers mingling on 
     board.

     TIGHT ON HOUSEBOAT'S ANCHOR CABLE

     --or rather the remnants of it. It's a piece of frayed 
     woven metal charred by extreme electricity, severed just 
     above water level. Suddenly there's blurry movement 
     behind it; camera RACK FOCUSES just in time to catch a 
     glimpse of JASON SLIPPING OFF THE SIDE, FLOATING TOWARDS 
     THE PILINGS.

     EXT. DOCKSIDE - SAME TIME

     as McCulloch impatiently checks his watch and list again. 
     Miss Van Deusen walks up to him.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          Hello, Charles. Has everyone checked 
          in?

                    MCCULLOCH
          Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never 
          showed up. I'm a little concerned.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          Don't be. They probably decided to 
          explore each other rather than New 
          York.

     He gives her a disdainful look, starting up the ramp. 

                    MCCULLOCH
          Let's go -- we're running two minutes 
          late.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          Charles, there's someone else coming 
          along too.

     He stops, following her glance. His face tightens.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     Rennie is walking toward them with a small suitcase, her 
     dog Toby striding next to her. She walks up to him, 
     starts to say something, then decides against it. Rennie 
     heads up the gangway. HOLD on McCulloch and Miss Van 
     Deusen. He's livid.

                    MCCULLOCH
          You have no right...

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          And neither do you. It's up to Rennie
          to decide what she wants to do.

                    MCCULLOCH
          She doesn't know what she wants. She's 
          never had a stable life.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          And she sure doesn't have one now, 
          either. She needs to live.

                    MCCULLOCH
          I'm her legal guardian, not you or 
          anybody else, and I alone know what's 
          best for her. End of discussion.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          No, I think it's just the beginning.

     She walks past him.

     EXT. RAMP/SHIP - ON RENNIE

     as she reaches the top of the gangway, her heart 
     pounding. Rennie pauses, working up the courage to look 
     out at the lake again.

     RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW

     The ROWBOAT she saw earlier is still there, even closer 
     now.

     RENNIE'S PUPILS

     contract, her blood pumping faster. Then she hears a 
     FAINT VOICE BELOW HER...

                    VOICE (O.S.)
          Hhhhelp me...

     Rennie looks straight down at the water beneath her and 
     sees:

     AN EIGHT YEAR OLD BOY 

     floundering in the water. It takes us only a moment to 
     recognize him -- IT'S YOUNG JASON. He's gasping, sucking 
     in huge amounts of liquid, exactly like he did in the 
     prologue.

                    YOUNG JASON
          Hhhhelp me....I'm drowning...

     RENNIE

     leans back in terror, falling into Miss Van Deusen.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          What's wrong, Rennie??

     Rennie frantically points over the ramp edge, unable to 
     speak. Miss Van Deusen quickly looks and sees:

     MISS VAN DEUSEN'S POINT OF VIEW

     The water is calm. No Young Jason.

     RETURN TO SHOT

     as Rennie gets a hold of herself.

                    RENNIE
          I just got a little dizzy. I'm fine.

     She continues up the ramp. HOLD on Miss Van Deusen, 
     watching her go, somewhat troubled by it. RACK to 
     McCulloch below her, also watching. Extremely concerned.

     RENNIE

     continues along the starboard side, not risking another 
     glance overboard. She passes an older, very deranged DECK 
     HAND, mopping the deck. HOLD on him, his bloodshot eyes 
     following her like a crazed raven.

     INT. BRIDGE - CLOSE ON HARPOON - DAY

     Sharp and rusty, mounted on the wall amidst jagged 
     scaling knives, shark jaws and other artifacts. WIDEN to 
     reveal they are surrounding a navigational chart on the 
     cruise ship's bridge. Admiral Robertson and his CHIEF 
     ENGINEER are preparing for departure, checking the OMEGA 
     satellite computer as well as the LORAN.

                    ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
               (checking watch)
          Let's take in the brow.

                    CHIEF ENGINEER
          Yes Sir.
               (into intercom phone.)
          Take in the gangway and single up all 
          lines.

     SEAN and MILES enter the room; Sean gets a glance from 
     his Dad. Miles is very impressed with the bridge.

                    SEAN
          Hello, Dad.

                    MILES
          Hey, Admiral Robertson. Love your 
          ship.

                    ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
          She's a beauty, isn't she? I should've 
          retired from the Navy ten years ago.

                    MILES
          You've really been generous to give us 
          this cruise. I know I speak for 
          everybody on board.

     Everybody...with the possible exception of Sean. He 
     avoids eye contact with his father.

                    

                    ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
          Hell, there's just twenty or so of you 
          -- we only need a skeleton crew and 
          it's a pleasure to sail her anyway.
               (beat)
          By the way, congratulations on winning 
          the intramural diving championships, 
          Miles. I'm sure you made your old man 
          proud.

     Admiral Robertson gives his own son a glance; maybe Sean 
     should think about doing the same.

                    CHIEF ENGINEER
          Have you decided on your departure 
          protocol, Admiral?

                    ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
          Actually, I thought I'd leave the 
          honors to my son.

                    SEAN
          Dad, I don't think...

                    ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
               (to Chief Engineer, ignoring 
               Sean)
          Relinquishing command of the Princess 
          Ruby to Captain Sean Robertson.

     Sean has no say in the matter. Miles can feel his 
     friend's nervousness as well.

                    ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
          But before you take the helm, take 
          this.

     He tosses Sean a wrapped box. Sean opens it. Inside is a 
     navigational computer the size of a calculator, sitting 
     next to a rusty old sextant.

                    ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
          Something old and something new. I 
          used the sextant when I was your age, 
          but now they have these goddamn 
          computers to do all the work for you.

                    CHIEF ENGINEER
               (to Sean)
          Have you decided on a plan of 
          departure, Captain?

     Sean's nervous. He eyes the Omega, quickly glancing at 
     the LORAN, briefly referring to the navigational chart.

                    SEAN
          How about if we start up the forward 
          engines and come around. 180 
          degrees...

                    ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
          Aren't you forgetting something?

     Sean looks flustered. Admiral Robertson storms to a 
     large button, pressing it three times, piercing the air 
     with three long blasts of the ship's horn. It 
     underscores his frustration.

                    ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
          We're in foggy weather! Send out the 
          international maritime signal that a 
          vessel is backing down, followed by a 
          security broadcast warning other 
          ships!

     He shoves the mike out at Sean, but he doesn't grab it, 
     leaving the bridge, humiliated. There's an awkward moment 
     for Miles, unable to find any appropriate words. He exits 
     as well. Admiral Robertson stares out the bridge window, 
     saddened and frustrated. It wasn't supposed to go this 
     way.

     EXT. DECK - ON SEAN

     as he continues away, his retreat blocked by the DECK 
     HAND. The crazy old man pierces a dead serious stare at 
     Sean.

                    DECK HAND
          This voyage is doomed.

                    SEAN
          Yeah, tell me about it.

     Sean sidesteps him, moving on.

     EXT. HARBOR - DAY (CRANE SHOT)

     Parents and relatives wave gleefully from the docks as 
     CAMERA RISES AND ROTATES to find eighteen or so teenagers 
     1ining the upper deck, happily waving back. The ship 
     begins to slice through serene water. The voyage has 
     begun.

     CLOSER ON HULL

     The water begins to ripple as the ship's speed increases. 
     All seems normal...until JASON'S HANDS APPEAR, CLINGING 
     TO A LOOSE MOORING LINE DRAGGING IN THE WATER. He 
     slithers up the side towards the deck as dense fog 
     breezes past him.

     EXT. DECK - DAY

     as Sean continues along, hands in pockets. He turns a 
     corner and collides with RENNIE, walking her dog. His 
     eyes instantly brighten, as do hers.

                    SEAN
          Rennie...

                    RENNIE
          Hi, Sean.

                    SEAN
          I heard you weren't coming.

                    RENNIE
               (glances at Toby)
          We changed our minds.

     Sean pats her dog. There's an awkward pause...they are 
     obviously in the early stages-of a relationship. 
     Sean reaches into his coat pocket, bringing back a small 
     necklace-sized box.

                    SEAN
          I got you a present.

                    RENNIE
          But I didn't get you one...

                    SEAN
          Forget it. It's a dumb little thing 
          anyway.

     Rennie opens it up, exposing a petite silver necklace 
     with a Statue of Liberty pendant on it. She's touched.

                    RENNIE
          Sean...it's beautiful.

     Sean takes it from her, snapping it around her neck.

                    SEAN
          I thought maybe we could hike to the 
          top of the Statue when we got there, 
          if you felt like it. It's supposed to 
          be 22 stories tall.

                    RENNIE
          I'd love to.

                    MCCULLOCH (O.S.)
          Your father was looking for you, Mr. 
          Robertson.

     McCulloch appears behind them. The mood has been broken.

                    SEAN
          I guess I'll see you later.

     Sean leaves. McCulloch steps up to Rennie, pointing out 
     to the foggy sea. Her respiration increases as she 
     psyches herself up to look.

                    MCCULLOCH
          There's a storm predicted tonight. 

     Rennie looks at the ocean, forcing herself not to turn 
     away.

                    MCCULLOCH
          You're making a big mistake, Rennie. 
          It's not too late to put you back on 
          land.

                    RENNIE
          I'm staying.

                    MCCULLOCH
          If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you 
          were of...

                    RENNIE
          She didn't push me into coming.

                    MCCULLOCH
          Why are you doing this to yourself?

                    RENNIE
          I don't even know why I'm afraid, 
          Uncle Charles. I can't even remember 
          when it started. Don't you think it's 
          time I found out and got over it?

     He takes a measured pause.

                    MCCULLOCH
          Facing your fear doesn't always 
          conquer it.

                    RENNIE
          I'm staying.

     He's not going to change her mind.

     P.O.V. - RENNIE AND MCCULLOCH (B & W/VIEWFINDER MATTE)

     through a porthole window...and through the viewfinder 
     of a video camcorder. McCulloch shakes his head, turning 
     away from Rennie and walking away. A sinister electric 
     guitar solo screeches out. PAN with McCulloch as he 
     passes the window, coming around 180 degrees into a CLOSE 
     UP of J.J. JARRETT, fingering a sleek Gibson "Flying V."

                    J.J.
               (into camera)
          Is this axe awesome or what?

     INT. J.J.'S STATEROOM - DAY

     as J.J., a female rocker in the vein of band "Vixen," 
     continues to wail on her guitar. She's wearing a black 
     leather corset, with wildly teased deep red hair. Holding 
     the camcorder is WAYNE WEBBER, MTV-acclimated, wearing 
     the latest hip prescription glasses.

                    WAYNE
          Too cool, J.J. Your parents came 
          through.

     She pops out the guitar cable from her practice amp.

                    J.J.
          No lie. I hear there's a big power 
          room down below where I can get 
          supreme concert hall echo. Come down 
          and shoot a basement tape on me, okay?

                    WAYNE
          Sure...but I gotta shoot some 
          shockumentary footage first.

     He avoids eye contact when he says it. She gives him a 
     look.

                    J.J.
          Man, don't tell me you're still trying 
          to scam on Tamara...

     His non-answer means yes. J.J. walks over to him, 
     grabbing his cheeks, shaking them like jello.

                    J.J.
          How long have we known each other? 
          Don't be a dweeb, Wayne. She's not 
          interested in you, only what you can 
          do for her. She's a user.

                    WAYNE
          She's sexy.

                    J.J.
          So's this guitar. So what?

                    WAYNE
          I'll catch you later.

                    

     He exits. She mumbles something under her breath, coiling 
     up her amp cord.

     INT. CORRIDOR - TRACKING WITH WAYNE

     as he walks onward. DROP DOWN to find his FEET as he 
     passes a DARK ALCOVE...which happens to have SLIMY 
     FOOTPRINTS AND SEAWEED leading into it. Camera FOLLOWS 
     the footprints, RISING again and with dim recognition, 
     our eyes fall on JASON. Lurking in the shadows. But not 
     for long.

     INT. POWER ROOM - DAY

     Massive, very dark, backlit steam seeping from a maze of 
     pipes overhead. No windows. A wall of circuit breakers 
     and voltage meters decorate one wall, quietly humming 
     generators on the opposite side. J.J. appears with her 
     guitar, amp and ghetto blaster, appreciative of the 
     surroundings.

                    J.J.
          This place is aching for a video. 
          Wayne, you're an asshole.

     She finds an outlet and plugs in her equipment.

     JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

     We're peering at J.J. predatorially through the steam, 
     moving through it, behind the generators.

     J.J.

     pops a cassette into her blaster, jamming the "play" 
     button. A loud rock 'n roll rhythm track blasts out.

     JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

     moving around the generators, eyeing her sleek leather 
     pants as she bends over to plug in her axe.

     TIGHT ON ELECTRIC GUITAR

     as J.J. snaps the male end of the plug into the female. 
     receptacle.

     JASON'S FACE

     appears for an instant through the vapor, then vanishes.
                    
     J.J.

     screams out the opening licks of her solo in sync with 
     her playback. The generators are causing a breeze which 
     makes her hair dance, steam flowing between her legs. 
     She's lost in her music, building to a crescendo, bending 
     the high "E" string above the upper octave fret. She 
     opens her eyes with the pleasure of it and sees:

     JASON

     emerging from a cloud of vapor like her worst nightmare.

     EXT. UPPER DECK - SAME TIME

     as J.J.'s SCREAM echoes from an exhaust duct. WHIP PAN to 
     find the crazed DECK HAND standing just below it, 
     reacting with dread. He's the only one who has heard it.

     INT. POWER ROOM - SAME TIME

     as Jason tears the guitar off her body, raising it in the 
     air like a hatchet. The horrified girl flees down a 
     narrow maze of steel steps, forced back against a 
     generator with nowhere to go. PUSH IN on her face for one 
     last look at her before:

     JASON

     swings the guitar downward and buries it in J.J.'s skull.

     EXT. UPPER DECK - SAME TIME

     as the Deck Hand flinches upon the thick, dull sound of 
     her demise, followed by discordant feedback from her 
     guitar...and eventual silence. He reaches into his breast 
     pocket, his hand shaking badly as he sips from a flask of 
     Early Times.

     EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT (EFX)

     as LIGHTNING FLASHES over a gray, choppy sea. A storm is 
     imminent. The Princess Ruby finally appears, cutting 
     through whitecaps, no land in sight.

     CLOSE UP - INK DIP PEN

     as Rennie's hand carefully dips it in India ink, moving 
     to a blank page in her journal. She hesitates for several 
     beats.

     INT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

     No inspiration. She puts down the pen, looking at her 
     dog, who's curled up on the bed.

                    RENNIE
          What do you think...time for some 
          personal experiences to fuel our 
          minds?

     The dog's eyes blink, but no more than that.

                    RENNIE
          I agree.

     Rennie moves to her closet, finding a silk blouse and 
     some black satin pants.

     EXT. OUTSIDE DECK - SAME TIME

     Wind is picking up, sweeping thick mist past a row of 
     decorative flags. One of them flaps back...AND EXPOSES 
     JASON.

     THROUGH JASON'S EYES (FLYING WALL EFX)

     as the flag whips our faces. We MOVE through it, down the 
     empty passageway, coming to a porthole window. Rennie's 
     window. We peer through it with unnerving intensity at 
     the backside of Rennie as she pulls off her T-shirt, 
     slipping on the blouse. Camera continues through the 
     tiny round window, floating across the room, over Toby 
     and the bed...until we're INCHES FROM THE BACK OF 
     RENNIE'S HEAD. She suddenly spins around in fright, 
     facing us point-blank, and:

     REVERSE ANGLE

     Nobody is there, her porthole window empty. But there's 
     something surreal about the window...

     TIGHT ON PORTHOLE WINDOW (EFX)

     Empty grayness...then EIGHT YEAR OLD JASON FLOATS UP FROM 
     BELOW, BUBBLES ESCAPING FROM HIS LIPS. The porthole has 
     become a window into the depths of Crystal Lake.

     RENNIE

     feels her throat catch with terror and an instant later:

     DOG TOBY

     begins to bark vociferously, rushing to her cabin door, 
     scratching to get out.

     RENNIE'S EYES

     are distracted to Toby for a second; when she looks back 
     at the porthole, she sees:

     AN EMPTY WINDOW

     No water, no drowning boy.

     RENNIE

     snaps out of it, moving to the door, where her dog is 
     frantically clawing with his fur up.

                    RENNIE
          Okay Toby, calm down...

     She's talking to herself as much as the dog. Rennie 
     closes the curtains on her window, then steps to her 
     door. She swings the door open for Toby...and exposes 
     an empty hall. Toby scrapes his way out of the room, 
     dashing off down the hall, snarling.

     INT. SHIP CORRIDOR - NIGHT

     as Toby runs straight toward us. PAN with him as he 
     rushes around a corner, leading us into a view of TAMARA 
     and EVA, disappearing down a staircase.

     INT. MENS GYM - DAY

     A strong seventeen year-old black kid, JULIUS GAW, is 
     going a few rounds with another senior boy who's clearly 
     losing the boxing match. Julius dances around him on the 
     mat like he's Mike Tyson, several other boys cheering 
     them on.

     REVERSE ANGLE - LOCKER ROOM WINDOW

     as Tamara and Eva step into view. Eva glances around, 
     feeling out of place in the men's locker room.

                    EVA
          I'm not sure we're supposed to be 
          here, Tamara.

     A couple of skinny boys wearing only towels walk by. But 
     Tamara doesn't notice them, her face pressed up against 
     the glass, watching Julius.

                    TAMARA
          Is that a muscular bod or what?

     Tamara puts on a sexy smile. The other boxer sees her 
     instead, instantly distracted. Julius lays him out with a 
     left-right-left combination. The onlookers applaud. 
     Julius pulls out his mouthpiece, giving Tamara a wicked 
     smile.

                    TAMARA
          He's undefeated, you know that?
               (beat)
          Julius is the only senior I'd even 
          consider doing it with. If he wasn't 
          black, that is.

                    EVA
               (awkward)
          My parents are open minded about that 
          sort of thing.

                    TAMARA
          My stepmom couldn't care less, but 
          Daddy would have a shit fit.
               (lets it slip out)
          He might even pay some attention to 
          me.

     Tamara quickly puts up her veneer again, spotting 
     something.

                    TAMARA
          Gorgeous guy at ten o'clock. Look 
          sensual.

     Both girls slip into instant sultry as a CREW MEMBER in 
     his mid-twenties passes them, wearing a tool belt. Very 
     masculine. He gives the girls a pleasant smile. Tamara 
     turns around to check out his back side.

                    TAMARA
          I think it's time for some 
          recreational activity, girl.

                    EVA
          Sounds good. I hear there's a 
          shuffleboard court on deck -- it might 
          be kinds cool...

                    TAMARA
          You're joking, right?

     She wasn't, but Eva tries to act like she was. Tamara 
     walks on, Eva following.

     INT. STATEROOM HALLWAY - NIGHT

     as McCulloch steps from Rennie's room, looking very 
     worried. Wayne Webber passes by, his eye stuck in his 
     viewfinder. McCulloch yanks the camcorder away from his 
     face.

                    MCCULLOCH
          Have you seen my niece anywhere?

                    WAYNE
          Yeah, motivating downstairs, I think. 
          What's the problem, Mr. McCulloch?

                    MCCULLOCH
          Senior predictions started five 
          minutes ago and she hasn't shown up.

                    WAYNE
          Some of us don't want our futures 
          predicted.

                    MCCULLOCH
          In your case I'm sure that's true.

     He brushes past Wayne angrily.

     INT. SERVICE AREA - NIGHT

     as Tamara drags Eva into a secluded service area, pulling 
     out her mirror, straw and baggie.

                    TAMARA
          The night time is the right time. 

     Tamara hands the straw to Eva.

                    EVA
               (nervous)
          No thanks.

                    TAMARA
          What? Don't be a lightweight...this is 
          top dollar toot.

                    EVA
          It's not that, it's just that...
               (beat)
          It I get caught, I'll lose my science 
          scholarship and everything.

                    TAMARA
          You're talking to the prom queen, 
          Eva. Do you really think I'm going to 
          risk getting caught?

                    EVA
               (a pause)
          I guess not.

                    TAMARA
          Do you realize how many people would 
          kill to be sitting here right now? 
          Come on, it's grad night. You've got 
          your whole life to be uptight.

     Eva takes the straw.

     STALKING POINT OF VIEW

     as we move down the corridor, in and out of shadows, 
     hearing giggles from Tamara and Eva up ahead. Jason's 
     coming...

     ANGLE - TAMARA AND EVA

     as Eva takes a nosefull, sneezing badly.

                    TAMARA
          Is that unbelievable or what?

     Tamara giggles, getting ready to tap out another line. 
     But the snickering stops upon the sound of APPROACHING 
     FOOTSTEPS. They both look up, every muscle tensing with 
     fear as:

     RENNIE

     appears from the shadows, just as startled to see them. 
     It's not Jason at all. Rennie can't help noticing the 
     cocaine, trying hard to ignore it.

                    TAMARA
          Jesus, you scared the hell out of us.

                    RENNIE  
          Have you seen my dog? I think he came 
          this way.

                    TAMARA
          No, we haven't.
               (awkwardly)
          Care for a hit?

                    RENNIE
          No thanks.

     Rennie continues on. After she's gone...

                    TAMARA
          A real space cadet. I wonder if she'll 
          narc on us...

                    EVA
          I have her in Creative Writing and 
          she's fairly nice.

                    TAMARA
          Nobody related to McCulloch can be 
          nice.

     Tamara puts the straw to her nose.

     ANGLE - RENNIE

     as she presses on, the corridor getting darker.

                    RENNIE
          Toby?

     No reply. She walks on, turning down the left hallway... 
     but camera turns down the right hallway. Suddenly JASON 
     REVEALS HIMSELF, quietly stepping from the GAME ROOM. 
     He's holding a pool cue, which he proceeds to snap in 
     half, providing a splintery sharp shaft.

     INT. SERVICE AREA - SAME TIME 

     as Tamara finishes off her line, wiping her nose with a 
     sniffle.

                    TAMARA
          Oh yeah. Ready to party and then some.

     She rolls up her baggie, stuffing it into her purse.

     STALKING POINT OF VIEW

     as we come down a corridor, turning into the Service 
     Area, stomping right up to Tamara and Eva. They both 
     GASP; Tamara drops her mirror, which SHATTERS on the 
     ground.

     REVERSE ANGLE

     They are facing McCulloch.

                    MCCULLOCH
          What are you doing in here?

                    TAMARA
          Nothing.

     He eyes the broken mirror. He wasn't born yesterday.

                    MCCULLOCH
          Are you girls using drugs?

                    EVA
          Do you think I would use drugs, Mr. 
          McCulloch? We were just exploring the 
          ship.

     He doesn't want to believe Eva is a druggie. But Tamara 
     is a different matter. He levels his eyes on her.

                    MCCULLOCH
          I'11 be coming around your stateroom 
          in exactly fifteen minutes, Miss 
          Mason. You'd better have your biology 
          project ready or I'm phoning your 
          parents.

                    TAMARA
          They're out of town.

                    MCCULLOCH
          Then I'll make sure you remain on 
          board while your classmates see the 
          sights.

     He's gotten to her with that one. McCulloch storms away.

                    EVA
          What are you going to do?

                    TAMARA
          Relax, I've got McCulloch covered... 
          but that little narcing bitch niece of 
          his is a different matter.
               (calculating)
          Rumor has it she's a teensy bit afraid 
          of the water...

     SPLASH!

     as a body pierces the surface of the deck swimming pool. 
     It's MILES, having just completed a dive from the high 
     board. Miss Van Deusen and several others stand at 
     poolside, giving him some applause.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          Poetry in motion, Miles.

                    MILES
          A half-twist short. I'll hone that 
          dive yet.

     He swims to the side, leading us to a view of Rennie. 
     She's very cautious about getting too close to the pool 
     edge as she approaches Miss Van Deusen.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          Rennie -- I was just on my way over to 
          your room

                    RENNIE
          Have you seen my dog anywhere?

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          No, but I'm sure Toby's fine. The 
          ship's only so big and there's 
          certainly no way off it, is there?

     She smiles reassuringly, but her words are less than 
     comforting.

     INT. SHIP CORRIDOR - TRACKING WITH TOBY - SAME TIME

     as the canine continues to sniff out Jason through the 
     maze of corridors. TRACK with the dog as he slows his 
     pace, knowing he's getting close to something.

     TOBY'S POINT OF VIEW (STEADICAM)

     Low to the ground, creeping past a steam vent which 
     obscures his vision, then turning down a metal staircase, 
     weaving into another passageway. Then with absolutely no 
     warning, A BODY FALLS FROM ABOVE, THUDDING DIRECTLY IN 
     FRONT OF US.

     TOBY

     rears back with teeth bared, but:

     THE BODY

     is quite dead: Toby is snarling at the corpse of the 
     TEENAGE BOXER who lost his bout against Julius. He's 
     still in his boxing shorts...BUT JASON'S SPLINTERY POOL 
     CUE HAS BEEN STABBED THROUGH HIS CHEST.

     EXT. DECK POOL - ON RENNIE AND MISS VAN DEUSEN

     as they walk along the edge of the pool.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          So, are you having fun yet?

                    RENNIE
               (lying)
          Yeah...a lot.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          I seem to detect a hint of 
          ingenuousness in your tone.
               (beat)
          In other words, level with me.

                    RENNIE
               (a pause)
          There's something I haven't told 
          you...

     ...But before she can begin the next sentence, Rennie is 
     shoved from behind.

                    

     WATER ANGLE

     as she SPLASHES INTO THE POOL'S DEEP END.

     MISS VAN DEUSEN

     spins around, seeing Tamara standing there with Eva.

                    TAMARA
          Wow, sorry...

     RENNIE

     flounders at the surface, nobody realizing the terror 
     she's experiencing. She's too scared to even cry for 
     help.

     MISS VAN DEUSEN

     isn't looking at Rennie, her attention on admonishing 
     Tamara.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          Why on earth would you do something 
          like that?

                    TAMARA
          It was an accident, I swear...

     Eva avoids eye contact, feeling awful. Sean comes walking 
     up, seeing Rennie.

                    SEAN
          What happened?
               (to Rennie)
          Rennie, are you okay?

     RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW

     She's can't even hear Sean, her vision being splashed by 
     the chlorinated water. She sinks under the surface, 
     turning around...AND COMING FACE TO FACE WITH YOUNG 
     JASON. The eight year-old corpse GRABS HER ANKLE AND 
     TRIES TO DRAG HER DOWN.

     SEAN'S POINT OF VIEW

     as Rennie sinks under the surface, all alone, thrashing 
     in terror.

     SEAN

     realizes she's in trouble. He immediately dives in after 
     her, pulling her to the pool's edge, where Miss Van 
     Deusen helps to lift her out.

     TAMARA AND EVA

     quickly move on.

                    TAMARA
          That was truly excellent.

                    EVA
               (feels like shit)
          Yeah.

                    TAMARA
          Time to check out the waiters.

                    EVA
          I think I'll pass. See you later, 
          okay?

                    TAMARA
          But...wait a minute!

     Eva walks away. Tamara acts angry, but deep down she's 
     hurt.

                    TAMARA
          Some friend you are.

     EXT. POOL SIDE - SAME TIME

     as Sean climbs from the pool to join Miss Van Deusen, who 
     is trying to comfort Rennie.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
               (to Sean)
          Bring her a towel, okay?

     Sean nods, hurrying off as others start to crowd around. 
     Miss Van Deusen looks up at them.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          She's fine -- everybody go back to 
          what you were doing.

     They disperse. Rennie slowly starts to cry, holding tight 
     to her teacher.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          Care to talk about it?

     After a moment to compose herself...

                    RENNIE
          I can't swim.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          I gathered that.

     Rennie says nothing else. Miss Van Deusen knows she's 
     holding out.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          I had a skiing accident in high 
          school, broke my left leg. It took 
          three winters before I would even look 
          at the snow again...but the solution 
          kept eluding me.
               (beat)
          I finally took lessons. I've never 
          broken a bone since.

                    RENNIE
          It's not that simple.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          Maybe not. But you're not telling me 
          everything, are you?

                    RENNIE
               (long pause)
          Whenever I get near the water, I see 
          this young boy drowning. He tries to 
          pull me down with him.

     The teacher didn't expect this, taking a thoughtful 
     pause.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          When did this start?

                    RENNIE
          About four years ago...at Crystal 
          Lake. I spent a few summers there with 
          Uncle Charles inbetween boarding 
          school.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          After your parents passed away?

     Rennie nods somberly.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          Did you have an accident in the lake?

                    RENNIE
          No. It was just a normal summer. I've 
          never been able to figure it out.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          Only one young boy ever drowned in 
          that lake, and that was before you 
          were even born. His name was Jason 
          Voorhees.

     The name has triggered some deep memory...but the 
     recollection vanishes upon the sound of her uncle's 
     voice.

                    MCCULLOCH (O.S.)
          Dear God...

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     as McCulloch rushes over to Rennie, seeing that she's 
     soaked. He's livid.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          She's fine, Charles. Take it easy...

                    MCCULLOCH
          Oh, I can see that. You've done a 
          wonderful job of supervising the kids, 
          Miss Van Deusen.

                    RENNIE
          It wasn't her fault.

     He gets Rennie to her feet just as Sean runs back with a 
     towel. McCulloch grabs it from him, wrapping it around 
     his niece, facing both Miss Van Deusen and Sean.

                    MCCULLOCH
          Stay away from her...both of you.

     He starts to lead her away. The crazy DECK HAND blocks 
     their path, slipping his flask away.

                    DECK HAND
          He's come back and you're all going to 
          die.

     Rennie gazes at the Deck Hand, then back at McCulloch.

                    RENNIE
          Just...leave me alone...

     She pulls away from him, hurrying off, confused and 
     frightened. McCulloch's retinas pierce the Deck Hand with 
     scorn. He checks his watch, then storms off.

     INT. TAMARA'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

     as a loud, firm KNOCK punctuates the silence. Then comes 
     a sultry voice...

                    TAMARA (O.S.)
          The door's open.

     McCulloch swings it open.

                    MCCULLOCH
          I'm in no mood for any more stall 
          tactics, Miss Mason. Where is your 
          final project?

     REVERSE ANGLE

     as Tamara fills a pair of champagne glasses with a bottle 
     of Dom Perignon. She's wearing a full body robe.

                    TAMARA
          Wouldn't you like a glass of champagne 
          first, Charles?

     He's about to lose his temper. McCulloch steps closer.

                    MCCULLOCH
          Where did you get that alcohol?

                    TAMARA
          I packed it. Just for us.

     EXT. DECK CORRIDOR - STALKING POINT OF VIEW

     as we approach Tamara's porthole window, peering through 
     it. We can't hear the words but we can clearly see the 
     people.

     INT. TAMARA'S STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS

     as McCulloch takes the bottle from her, setting it down 
     on her nightstand.

                    MCCULLOCH
          That's it. You're not setting foot off 
          this ship until we return home.

                    TAMARA
          But I haven't even shown you my 
          biology project...

     Tamara unties her robe. PAN DOWN to the floor with it as 
     it softly piles at her bare feet.

     ANGLE - PORTHOLE WINDOW

     as the SHADOW OUTSIDE quickly blurs past the window.

     RETURN TO SCENE

     McCulloch is flabbergasted, too stunned to fully react. 
     Tamara is wearing a layered teddy, which she's beginning 
     to unsnap, exposing her lithe body...but that's not all. 
     Tamara has drawn all her major organs on her bare skin.

                    TAMARA
          Take a closer look, Charles. I want to 
          make sure I labeled all my organs 
          correctly.

     EXT. TAMARA'S STATEROOM - STALKING POINT OF VIEW

     as we approach her door, still cracked open from 
     McCulloch's entrance. We get there just in time to see 
     Tamara slip her arms around McCulloch, planting her lips 
     on his, pressing her nubile flesh up against his stiffly 
     starched shirt.

     INT. TAMARA'S STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS

     as she holds him tight. He finally breaks away in a fit 
     of anger.

                    MCCULLOCH
          Oh, you've done it now. Not only are 
          you going home, I'll see to it that 
          you spend next year back in a high 
          school classroom!

     He storms for the door, swinging it open, coming face to 
     face with:

     WAYNE

     who casually lowers his camcorder.

                    TAMARA
          I don't think so, Mr. McCulloch.
               (to Wayne)
          Did you get anything good?

     His eyes are unable to leave her nakedness.

                    WAYNE
          Oh yeah.

     She quickly slips on her robe again, all business. 
     McCulloch realizes what has just transpired.

                    MCCULLOCH
          You'll never get away with it.
               (eyeing Wayne)
          And you can forget about ever 
          attending any film school.
               (serious beat)
          You're both going to be very, very 
          sorry.

     He storms off. Wayne looks very, very nervous. Tamara 
     steps over to him, cuddling up.

                    TAMARA
          Relax, Wayne. He won't risk doing a 
          thing.
               (beat)
          Can I have the tape?

     He pops the eject button, absently handing it over. Wayne 
     steps into her room, nervous and excited to be there. He 
     lifts the glass of champagne she poured for McCulloch.

                    WAYNE
          This is going to sound supremely 
          lame...but I've had the major hots for 
          you since our sophomore year, Tamara.

     He gulps down the fizz. She forces a smile, stashing the 
     incriminating videotape.

                    TAMARA
          That's sweet, Wayne. Look, I'd love to 
          chat but I'm really pressed for time.
               (ushering him to door)
          Let's try to get together later, okey-
          doke?

                    WAYNE
          But I thought...

                    TAMARA
          Thanks for the camerawork.

     And out he goes, the door shut in his face. Wayne stands 
     outside her room, realizing he's a major chump.

                    WAYNE
          Wayne, you're an asshole.

     He despondently exits.

     INT. TAMARA'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME (STEADICAM)

     as Tamara heads for the bathroom, slipping off her robe. 
     She moves to the shower curtain and we're right behind 
     her. Her hand reaches up, grabbing the curtain, yanking 
     it back...

     Nothing is there.

     INT. LADIES RESTROOM - SAME TIME - NIGHT (EFX)

     as Rennie enters, her eyes reddened. She moves to the 
     sink, looking at herself in the mirror. So much for the 
     silk blouse and satin pants, not to mention her soaked 
     hair. Rennie runs some warm water, rinsing her face.

     When she starts to fill her hands a second time, BLOOD 
     POURS OUT THE FAUCET INSTEAD OF WATER. Rennie gasps, 
     jerking up and seeing YOUNG JASON REFLECTED ON THE OTHER 
     SIDE OF THE MIRROR, SPLASHING IN WATER.

                    RENNIE
          It's not real, it's not real...

     INT. TAMARA'S SHOWER - SAME TIME

     as water from the shower head SPLASHES CAMERA for a beat 
     before Tamara turns it off.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     as Tamara reaches for her robe, slipping it on. Her body 
     paint has been washed off. 
     She steps from the shower, glancing in her vanity mirror 
     AND SEEING THE REAL JASON REFLECTED IN IT. Tamara spins 
     around, looking face to face with JASON IN HER BATHROOM. 
     Just as she SCREAMS:

     INT. LADIES RESTROOM - SAME TIME (EFX)

     Young Jason reaches out to grab Rennie, HIS FIST CRASHING 
     THROUGH THE MIRROR. Right when Rennie SCREAMS:

     INT. TAMARA'S BATHROOM - SAME TIME

     The real Jason SHATTERS TAMARA'S VANITY MIRROR WITH HIS 
     FIST. He grabs a sharp chunk of it, advancing on a 
     whimpering Tamara.

                    TAMARA
          Please...please don't...

     Jason raises the shard above her and just as she 
     SHRIEKS...

     CLOSE UP - STEAM WHISTLE OF SHIP

     as it blasts loudly in the bleak stormy night. It begins 
     to rain.

     EXT. LADIES RESTROOM - NIGHT

     as Rennie comes rushing out, right into the arms of. 
     Sean. She clings to him, sobbing as the rain falls over 
     them.

                    SEAN
          It's okay...you're going to be okay.

                    RENNIE
          I want to go home. I want off this 
          ship.

     After a moment...

                    SEAN
          Me too.
               (beat)
          Let's go talk to my Dad.

     He puts his arm around her, leading her toward the 
     bridge.

     INT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

     as wind and rain pummel the bridge window.. Admiral 
     Robertson turns to his Chief Engineer.

                    ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
          Let's kick in the stablilizers, Mr. 
          Carlson, and get the seas off the 
          quarter. These kids are in for one 
          hell of a storm.

                    CHIEF ENGINEER
          Yes Sir. Activating comfort cruise 
          mode.

     The Chief Engineer moves to a bank of toggle switches, 
     flipping a row of them.

     TIGHT ON NAVIGATIONAL CHART WALL - SAME TIME

     as a bloodstained HAND silently removes the rusty 
     harpoon hanging above the map.

     ADMIRAL ROBERTSON

     gets a reflective look in his weary eyes.

                    ADMIRAL-ROBERTSON
          How olds your boy now, Carlson?

                    CHIEF ENGINEER
          Nineteen months.

                    ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
          A tremendous age. Take some advice 
          from a salty old man: don't push him 
          too hard.

     The Chief Engineer nods with a sympathetic smile as the 
     Admiral steps off the bridge, onto the stormy deck, 
     contemplating the sea. The Chief Engineer moves to the 
     radio/intercom console. He lifts a telephone, punching in 
     a three digit number. PUSH IN TIGHT ON HIS FACE.

                    CHIEF ENGINEER
          This is the bridge. Approaching 
          weather suggests we secure the main 
          deck and...

     His sentence is sharply cut off, his head jerking from 
     excruciating, instant pain. 
     His mouth contorts with words no one will ever hear as he 
     stares into the face of:

     JASON

     holding the opposite end of the harpoon. He shoves it 
     forward with one more staccato jerk and:

     CLOSE UP - CHIEF ENGINEER'S BACK

     -- The harpoon's bloody, corroded tip pierces through 
     his once-white uniform.

     ADMIRAL ROBERTSON

     returns to the bridge as LIGHTNING flashes outside.

                    ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
          Better have them doublecheck the 
          lifeboat stations as well...

     Admiral Robertson stops cold upon the sight of Mr. 
     Carlson. He hurries over to him, kneeling down, freezing 
     as a pair of MUDDY FEET ENTER FRAME. Admiral Robertson 
     bends his neck upwards to face:

     JASON

     hovering over him, now clutching one of the scaling 
     knives.

     INT. BRIDGE CORRIDOR - NIGHT

     as Sean and Rennie walk up the corridor leading to the 
     bridge.

                    RENNIE
          Can he really take us home?

                    SEAN
          Not completing a voyage is against 
          everything he stands for. But I think 
          I can convince him to call a Coast 
          Guard cutter for you.

                    RENNIE
          What about you?

                    SEAN
          If I go with you, he'll never
          speak to me again.
               (beat)
          But I'm never going to live up to his 
          expectations anyway...so maybe it's 
          the right thing to do.

     He's made a big decision. Sean takes her hand as they 
     walk on.

     THEIR POINT OF VIEW

     moving closer and closer to the bridge door, having not 
     the slightest inclination of what's in store for them.

     SEAN

     knocks on the bridge door. No answer. He's confused. He 
     pushes the door open but something is blocking it. Sean 
     puts his weight into it, shoving hard.

     INT. BRIDGE

     as the door slides open, Sean stepping inside. His eyes 
     roil downwards upon seeing THE DEAD CHIEF ENGINEER, THE 
     HARPOON PROTRUDING FROM HIS BLOODY CHEST.

                    SEAN
          Oh Jesus...Dad??

     Sean looks over at the helm...where his father is still 
     sitting in the swivel chair, his back to them. Silent. 
     Sean sidesteps the Chief Engineer's corpse, moving toward 
     his father as Rennie remains frozen in shock.

     SEAN'S POINT OF VIEW

     Slowly walking toward Admiral Robertson...at least he 
     thinks it's his dad because he's unable to see his 
     face. Is it Jason now wearing the uniform?? When he's 
     about two feet away from him...

     SEAN

     reaches out and swivels the chair around. It is his 
     father BUT HIS THROAT HAS BEEN SLIT. Sean staggers 
     backwards, uncomprehending, his senses overloaded. We 
     MOVE with him until he's backed into Rennie, clutching 
     onto him tightly.

                    SEAN
          He's...he's dead...

     INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME

     as Miss Van Deusen steps up to Rennie's door, gently 
     knocking.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          Ronnie? I just came by to see how you 
          were feeling...

     No answer. She knocks harder...and it creaks open, 
     unlocked.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          Rennie...?

     Suddenly the door is jerked from her grasp and swung 
     open. MCCULLOCH is standing on the other side of it.

                    MCCULLOCH
          I thought I told you to stay away from 
          her.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
               (holds her ground)
          Where is she?

                    MCCULLOCB
               (accusing)
          That's a very good question and I'd 
          appreciate an answer.

     A LOUD BUZZER blares out of an intercom speaker next to 
     their heads, causing the teachers to both jump. Sean's 
     unsteady voice immediately follows.

                    SEAN (V.O.)
          Attention everybody, attention. This 
          is Sean Robertson...

     EXT. SWIMMING POOL - SAME TIME

     Miles is toweling off under the shelter of a gazebo as 
     Sean's voice blares out of a rain-pounded megaphone 
     speaker nearby.

                    SEAN (V.O.)
          There's been...
               (swallows)
          What I mean is, this is an 
          emergency...

     Miles knows he can't be joking around. Wayne comes 
     walking by, covering his camcorder with his jacket.

                    WAYNE
          Miles -- have you seen J.J.? She was 
          supposed to be jamming down in the 
          power room but...

     Miles gestures for him to be quiet, listening very 
     worriedly.

                    SEAN (V.O.)
          Repeat, this is an emergency...

     INT. GYM LOCKERS - SAME TIME

     as JULIUS and two other senior boys finish dressing after 
     a shower, hearing Sean's words reverberate around them.

                    SEAN (V.O.)
          I want everybody to meet on the 
          bridge...

                    JULIUS  
          What the fuck is this?

     The others shrug, concerned.

     EXT. SHUFFLEBOARD COURT - SAME TIME

     The wooden shuffleboard disks are drowning in 
     precipitation. Eva stands alone in the rain, staring at 
     the court as Sean's voice continues.

                    SEAN (V.O.)
          Stay calm, but get here as quick as 
          possible. Walk with a friend if you 
          can...

     Eva wipes the rain from her face, then walks away.

     INT. BRIDGE - ON SEAN

     trying his best to keep it together. He glances at his 
     dead father, still unable to believe it.

                    SEAN (V.O.)
          God, I wish this was a joke, but it's 
          not.

     Sean slowly puts down the phone. He's lost in a daze. 
     Suddenly the SHIP LURCHES, a huge swell SPLASHING THE 
     BRIDGE WINDOW. Admiral Robertson's body falls from the 
     swivel chair.

                    RENNIE
          What is happening???

     Sean regains his balance, moving to the computer console, 
     looking at the OMEGA and LORAN like he's never seen them 
     before.

                    SEAN
          I don't know...we've gone off course 
          or something...

                    RENNIE
          What do you mean???

     Another wave hammers the bow. She's in a state of awful 
     panic.

                    SEAN
          I don't know what I mean! All's I know 
          is that there's no one guiding this 
          ship anymore...

     Sean is starting to lose it. The fear of the ocean 
     guiding her, Rennie rushes to him, gripping and shaking 
     him.

                    RENNIE
          Can't you call for help??

     Sean tries to get a grip and assess the situation, pacing 
     frenetically.

                    SEAN
          I think so. But we have to lower the 
          anchors so we don't drift any 
          further...

                    RENNIE
          Where are they?

                    SEAN
          The bow...front of the ship. There's a 
          hoist on each side that lowers them

     She starts to exit.

                    SEAN
          I didn't mean for you to go!

                    RENNIE
          Just radio for help, okay???

     She hurries out the door, working on terror-induced 
     adrenaline. Sean rushes to the radio console, depressing 
     the keying button, speaking into the mike.

                    SEAN
          Mayday, mayday, mayday...

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     as JULIUS arrives with the others from the locker room. 
     They react to the dead bodies while Sean continues at the 
     radio.

                    SEAN
          Please...can anybody out there hear 
          me??

     No response. WAYNE and MILES rush in.

                    MILES
          Sean, what's going on?

     Then he sees the corpses. He needs no further answer.

                    WAYNE
          Jesus Christ...

     He's too scared to even videotape it. Sean is bombarded 
     with questions as he tries to figure out the radio.

                    JULIUS
          Who did this, man?

                    WAYNE
          Is the radio even working??

                    MILES
          Isn't there some international S.O.S. 
          thing you can do???

                    SEAN
               (suddenly remembers)
          Channel 16...the distress frequency...
               (dialing knob)
          Mayday, mayday, mayday...this is the 
          Princess Ruby. Please, somebody 
          answer...

     EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT (STOCK)

     as a COAST GUARD CUTTER tracks through stormy seas.

                    RADIO OFFICER (V.O.)
          This is Coast Guard cutter Dallas. 
          What is the nature of your problem, 
          Ruby?

     INT. BRIDGE - ON SEAN AND OTHERS

     as they hear the voice, reacting, relieved and thrilled.

                    SEAN
          The Captain and Chief Engineer... 
          they've been...they're dead.

                    RADIO OFFICER (FILTERED V.O.)
               (a grave-pause)
          What is your location?

                    SEAN
          I...I don't know...

                    RADIO OFFICER (FILTERED V.O.)
          Is your ship equipped with Omega 
          satellite navigation or LORAN?

                    SEAN
          Yes...

                    RADIO OFFICER (FILTERED V.O.)
          The LORAN has a digital printout of 
          your latitude and longitude. Give me 
          the coordinates and we'll be there as 
          quick as we can.

     Sean hurries to the LORAN, reading the numbers.

     EXT. DECK - RADIO ANTENNA - SAME TIME (EFX)

     as LIGHTNING STRIKES above it in the night sky. Camera 
     slowly ADJUSTS to find the RADIO ANTENNA CABLE. A second 
     later, JASON'S HAND REACHES FOR IT, GETTING A FIRM GRASP.

     INT. BRIDGE - SAME TIME

     as Sean hurries back to the radio, pressing it against 
     his spitless mouth.

                    SEAN
          I've got the numbers.

                    RADIO OFFICER (FILTERED V.O.)
          Give me the degrees first, followed by 
          minutes and sec...

     Suddenly his voice is CUT OFF, followed by STATIC.

                    SEAN
          Hello? Are you there??

     No response. A lump sinks into everyone's throat.

     EXT. DECK - RADIO ANTENNA

     as Jason drops the cable he's just torn out, marching 
     onward.

     EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

     as McCulloch bursts onto the bridge, followed by Miss Van 
     Deusen.

                    MCCULLOCH
          I demand to know what is going on...

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          Oh dear God...

     She's seen the bodies. McCulloch follows her glance, 
     paling. He quickly takes charge, pushing through the 
     students.

                    MCCULLOCH
          Where's the radio?

                    SEAN
          It's...dead.

                    DECK HAND (O.S.)
          You're all going to die.

     All heads spin as the deranged DECK HAND treads out from 
     a shadowy corridor.

                    DECK HAND
          You're the last ones. He's come back 
          for you.

                    MCCULLOCH
          What are you talking about?

     The Deck Hand takes a final swig from his flask, dropping 
     it with unsteady hands.

                    DECK HAND
          Jason Voorhees.

     There is a collective, disconcerting silence triggered by 
     the infamous name.

                    MCCULLOCH      
          You're insane, old man. Jason Voorhees 
          has been dead for over thirty years.

                    DECK HAND
          He walks this ship, here and now.

                    MCCULLOCH
          A killer walks this ship indeed. And 
          it's certainly none of us...

     The crazed old man gets his drift. Everyone looks at him 
     suspiciously. McCulloch grabs a SCALING KNIFE off the 
     wall, taking a step towards him.

                    DECK HAND
          You're the one who's insane!!

     The raving man flees back the way he came. McCulloch 
     raises the flare gun; Miss Van Deusen grabs McCulloch's 
     arm, stopping him.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          What are you doing??

                    MCCULLOCH
          That lunatic has been spouting off 
          about Jason since we boarded... 
               (eyeing bodies)
          It's no coincidence.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          But that doesn't prove that he's the 
          one!

                    MCCULLOCH
          Walking corpses are not real!

                    JULIUS
          Yeah, well these dead bodies are sure 
          enough real.
               (to the others)
          I say we regroup and find this 
          motherfucker before he finds us. 

     There's a murmur; it makes sense.

                    MCCULLOCH
          You'll do no.such thing and watch your 
          mouth, young man! I'm in charge here!

     They all look at McCulloch defiantly.

                    JULIUS
          School's out, McCulloch.
               (to the others)
          Let's go.

     Julius walks off the bridge; all the seniors follow 
     except Sean.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          Please everybody, stay here!!

     They don't listen. McCulloch starts to go after 
     them...and then it hits him:

                    MCCULLOCH
          Christ...where's Rennie??

                    SEAN
          She's...she's dropping the anchors. I 
          thought the Coast Guard could find us 
          easier if...

                    MCCULLOCH
          What?? You sent her out there with a 
          murderer running around loose??

     EXT. DECK - NIGHT

     as Rennie moves past wet, empty lounge chairs towards the 
     bow. She passes a row of translucent windows. The first 
     three are normal...but the fourth has the SILHOUETTE OF 
     JASON ON ITS OPPOSITE SIDE. 
     He begins to stride parallel to her, then disappears 
     when the windows end and a wall takes over.

     INT. BRIDGE CORRIDOR - NIGHT

     as Julius and his followers continue on, passing Eva, 
     who's coming up from a staircase. She stops Wayne.

                    EVA
          What's going on? I heard on the P.A. 
          system that...

                    WAYNE
               (interrupting)
          The Captain's been murdered. The buzz 
          is that Jason might be on board.

                    EVA
          Jason...Voorhees?

     She knows the legend as weld as everybody else. Wayne 
     nods gravely, moving to catch up with the others. Eva 
     rushes up to him again.

                    EVA
          Have you seen Tamara?

                    WAYNE
          No. And I'm not losing any sleep over 
          it.

                    EVA
          But she might be in trouble...

                    WAYNE
          So what else is new?
               (beat)
          Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude 
          to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise 
          up -- it's not hip to be her friend.

                    EVA
          I don't care about being hip anymore.

     She means it. Wayne nods with understanding.

                    WAYNE
          I'm sorry, but I've gotta find J.J.

     He hurries on.

     EXT. BOW - NIGHT

     as Rennie appears, fighting the wind and rain to get 
     closer to the anchor hoists.

     POINT OF VIEW THROUGH DECK WINDOW - SAME TIME

     --spying on Rennie like a wolf watching a lamb. We MOVE a 
     few windows down, getting a better view of her.

     REVERSE ANGLE - ON JASON

     deciding that the time is right to strike. His hand moves 
     to the bow entrance door knob, slowly turning it, pulling 
     it open.

     EXT. BOW - ON RENNIE

     moving closer to the right anchor hoist, her back to us 
     as well as Jason. She climbs behind the hoist, looking at 
     the consoles. Then suddenly a BARK.

                    RENNIE
          Toby?

     She turns, catching a glimpse of her dog running down the 
     side of the deck. Rennie leaves the hoist, going after 
     Toby.

     JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

     through the crack in the door, watching Rennie 
     unexpectedly take off. He's about to move after her when 
     ha hears:

                    EVA (O.S.)
          Tamara? Are you around here anywhere?

     Jason quietly closes the door. Rennie will have to wait.

     INT. CORRIDOR - TRACKING WITH EVA

     as she cautiously walks along, poking her head in every 
     alcove.

                    EVA
          Tamara?

     JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

     moving down the same corridor, catching a glimpse of Eva 
     before she turns a corner and disappears.

     INT. HALLWAY/TAMARA'S STATEROOM - MOVING WITH EVA 
     (STEADICAM)

     Eva steps into the hallway outside Tamara's stateroom. 
     She walks up to Tamara's door, knocking on it. It swings 
     open, unlocked.

                    EVA
          Tamara?
               (no response)
          I just want to talk with you.

     She steps into Tamara's room and we go in with her. The 
     quarters are empty. Eva stands there for a beat, confused 
     and scared. She's about to leave when a CREAKING SOUND 
     causes her to look back at:

     THE BATHROOM DOOR

     It slowly swings open...splashing Eva's eyes with 
     grotesque multi-images of Tamara: SHE IS HANGING ON THE 
     DOOR HOOK, HER BODY PIN-CUSHIONED WITH A DOZEN MIRROR 
     SRARDS.

     EVA

     shrieks, running back out the door...

     INT. STATEROOM HALLWAY

     ...and sliding to a abrupt halt because JASON IS STANDING 
     AT THE END OF THE HALLWAY. He moves toward Eva like a 
     bulldozer. She turns a rapid 180 and sprints in retreat.

     RUNNING WITH EVA (HAND HELD)

     Gasping for oxygen, Eva has no time to even scream as she 
     flees from the monster, erratically turning down a spiral 
     staircase and running on.

     JASON'S POINT OF VIEW (STEADICAM)

     chasing after her with the smooth determination of a 
     shark, never letting her get too far in the lead.

     INT. BOWELS OF SHIP - ON EVA

     Empty for a second, then Eva appears, weaving her way 
     through a maze of corridors and passageways. She races 
     past a sign directing passengers to "CLUB RUBY."

     ANGLE - JASON

     --entering the same corridor a beat after Eva exits it in 
     the direction of the disco. He tramples onward.

     INT. CORRIDOR/DISCO (STEADICAM)

     The thudding low frequency of a mesmerizing dance tune 
     precedes Eva as she tears open a door, entering the 
     corridor. MOVE BACKWARDS WITH HER as she rushes forward, 
     curving through the shallow passageway and emptying out 
     onto a high tech DISCO FLOOR. A flashing Star Wars 
     lighting system assaults her all directions along with 
     the music. She's all alone in here.

     TIGHT ON EVA

     The lights strobing across her face only accentuate her 
     terror. She spots another door on a small stage, rushing 
     to it. It's locked.

     CROOKED ANGLE - ENTRANCE DOOR

     as Jason enters the corridor, SLAMMING THE DOOR SHUT 
     BEHIND HIM.

     EVA

     decides this is the wrong place to be. She moves for the 
     corridor again and:

     JASON

     appears on the corridor steps for a brief second. The 
     spotlight goes black, then flashes on again. Now he's 
     gone.

     EVA

     backs away, sliding along the edge of the dance floor 
     like she's on a building ledge. Chaser lights and mirror 
     balls fondle her body as she moves as far away from the 
     point where she last saw him. But:

     JASON

     illuminates only ten feet from her, a crimson strobe 
     assaulting his hockey mask. She's on a collision course 
     with him.

     EVA  

     whirls dizzily to the center of the dance floor upon the 
     sight of him. Camera SPINS with her in 360 degree arcs, 
     PUSHING IN on her face.

     EVA'S POINT OF VIEW

     spiraling counter-clockwise on the dance floor, flashes 
     of Jason materializing where she least expects to see 
     him. And getting closer. Finally at the point of 
     exhaustion:

     EVA

     stops, looking everywhere.

     EVA'S POINT OF VIEW

     He seems to be gone. She catches her breath...then 
     sensing his presence, she revolves a half-turn to face:

     THE HOCKEY MASK

     exploding under a pin spotlight, standing directly 
     before her. His forearms recoil with lightning speed as 
     he grips her throat...

     WIDE SHOT - DISCO

     Thundering music. Frantic lights. And Jason and Eva at 
     the center of it all. HER FEET ARE TWENTY-FOUR INCHES OFF 
     THE GROUND, KICKING MADLY AS THE LIFE IS BEING CHOKED OUT 
     OF HER. Finally Eva's legs go rag doll limp. Jason flings 
     her to the ground like a sack of flour. This dance is 
     over.

     EXT. DECK - NIGHT

     Rennie appears again, scanning her no-visibility 
     surroundings.

                    RENNIE
          Toby? Where'd you go?

     No sign of her dog. She remembers her mission, heading to 
     the anchors again.

     EXT. BOW - CONTINUOUS

     as Rennie arrives on the bow, climbing into the left 
     hoist box behind the huge anchor cable.

     STALKING POINT OF VIEW

     moving up to the bow door like Jason did before, cracking 
     it open, seeing Rennie from behind. And moving towards 
     her.

     RENNIE

     is oblivious as she reads the directions above the 
     controls.

     INSERT - HOIST LEVER (SECOND UNIT)

     as Rennie's hand grabs it, shoving it forward.

     INSERT - GREEN HOIST BUTTON (SECOND UNIT)

     A moment later, her thumb finds it and depresses it.

     INSERT - ANCHOR CHAIN (SECOND UNIT)

     as the massive black chain links thunder to life.

     STALKING POINT OF VIEW

     He's now within ten feet of the unaware girl.

     RENNIE

     remains in the hoist box, making certain it is operating 
     correctly. A second later, we see the fleeting outline of 
     a HUMAN SHAPE appear behind her.

     STALKING POINT OF VIEW

     Three feet from Rennie. She spins around to climb out of 
     the hoist box and GASPS.

     REVERSE ANGLE

     She's facing MCCULLOCH. He immediately reaches past her, 
     yanking the lever back to its center position, and:

     THE ANCHOR CHAIN (SECOND UNIT)

     grinds to a halt.

     RETURN TO SHOT

     as McCulloch faces her, angrily grabbing Rennie's arms, 
     shouting over the storm.

                    MCCULLOCH
          You had me worried to death!

                    RENNIE
          But Sean said...

                    MCCULLOCH
          I'm the one you should be listening 
          to! Do you think dropping an anchor in 
          the middle of a storm makes any sense 
          whatsoever?

     She tries to find some defense, but McCulloch leads her 
     off before any wards come forth.

     CLOSE UP - EXERCISE MAT

     as a pair of SKEET RIFLES, three FIRE AXES, a FLARE GUN 
     and several POOL CUES are dumped onto the foam padded 
     plastic.

     INT. EXERCISE ROOM - NIGHT

     where Julius has gathered his small group of vigilantes, 
     including Miles and Wayne.

                    JULIUS
          I managed to scrounge this shit from 
          the game room and hallways. Grab what 
          you want.

     Wayne takes one of the rifles; Miles grabs the axe.

                    WAYNE
          What are you taking, Julius?

                    JULIUS
               (flexes fists)
          Nothin'.

                    WAYNE
               (dead serious)
          We're talking the possibility of Jason 
          Voorhees here.

     Julius pauses. He's not stupid.

                    JULIUS
          Nothin' but this gun.

     He reaches down, picking up the other rifle. And they 
     move.

     INT. STATEROOM HALLWAY/RENNIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

     as McCulloch guides his niece down the hallway, swinging 
     her door open.

                    RENNIE
          Can't we at least talk about it?

                    MCCULLOCH
          I refuse to discuss this ridiculous 
          notion that a ghoul is terrorizing 
          this ship.

                    RENNIE
          But what about the drowning boy I've 
          been seeing?

     He avoids eye contact. McCulloch takes her hand, ushering 
     her across the threshold. She's standing inside her room 
     now; he's in the hallway.

                    MCCULLOCH
          Whatever you've been...imagining... 
          has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees.
               (pause)
          I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's 
          all I care about.

                    RENNIE
          I'm not staying in my room, Uncle 
          Charles.

                    MCCULLOCH
          This isn't a request.

     He closes the door on her face, pulling out a key, 
     locking the dead bolt. She pounds on it from the other 
     side.

                    RENNIE (O.S.)
          Uncle Charles!

     He ignores her, briskly walking away.

     INT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME

     as she throws her fists against the door a final time, 
     realizing it's futile.

     INT. POWER ROOM - NIGHT

     Steam continues to seep from the maze of criss-crossing 
     pipes. Wayne appears on one of the catwalks. He's holding 
     the skeet rifle under one arm, using the sun gun off his 
     video camera to guide him.

                    WAYNE
          J.J. -- you down here?

     CLOSER ANGLE

     as Wayne carefully lets his light guide him down the 
     precarious walkway. An unexpected blast of steam scares 
     the crap out of him, causing him to stumble.

     INSERT - WAYNE'S GLASSES (SECOND UNIT)

     --They slip off the bridge of his nose, skittering down 
     through the catwalk and pipes to God knows where.

     WAYNE

     lies helplessly on the metal grid work, realizing his 
     bleak predicament has just been squared. He pulls himself 
     to a standing position again.

                    WAYNE
          We got a major problem, Wayne.

     WAYNE'S BLURRY POINT OF VIEW

     His vision now gives him shadows and shapes rather than 
     crisp images. He raises the gun and continues unsteadily 
     forward.

     POINT OF VIEW THROUGH GRID WORK

     as Wayne inches forward. Camera slowly PANS INTO A 
     PROFILE OF JASON, watching him from a catbird seat.

     WAYNE

     takes another step, almost tripping on a set of stairs 
     leading down to the next level. And when he arrives 
     there...

     WAYNE'S BLURRY POINT OF VIEW

     ...A LARGE FIGURE STEPS OUT, HOLDING WHAT APPEARS TO BE A 
     KNIFE.

     WAYNE

     instantly raises the rifle and FIRES...

     WAYNE'S BLURRY POINT OF VIEW

     ...and the body goes down. He's hit him!

     WAYNE

     stands there, breathing some relief. He gets an idea, 
     looking through his camcorder eyepiece. Wayne begins to 
     adjust the eyepiece diaptor.

     WAYNE'S POINT OF VIEW (B & W/VIEWFINDER MATTE)

     as the figure on the ground slips in and out of focus, 
     finally becoming crisp. WAYNE HAS SHOT A CREW MEMBER -- 
     the same good looking one Tamara and Eva ogled earlier. 
     He's holding a screwdriver from his waist band tool set, 
     not a knife.

     WAYNE

     slowly lowers his camera as his heart rises into his 
     throat.

                    WAYNE
          No...

     He raises his camcorder again, hoping a second view will 
     reveal a dead Jason rather than this young man.

     WAYNE'S POINT OF VIEW (B & W/VIEWFINDER MATTE)

     He gets half his wish: a HOCKEY MASK NOW FILLS HIS 
     FRAME...but Jason is far from dead. Wayne catches a split-
     second glimpse of Jason's fist coming towards him, then 
     the camera is KNOCKED FROM HIS EYE AND THE WORLD BECOMES 
     DARK AND BLURRY.

     WAYNE

     screams, blindly running as fast as he can. He trips, 
     picking himself up, stumbling down the catwalk stairs. 
     Wayne makes it about ten feet before he stumbles over 
     something, bringing with it a harsh strum from an 
     ELECTRIC GUITAR.

     ANGLE - WAYNE'S FEET

     Sure enough, his left shoe is resting on the pickups of a 
     blood-streaked Gibson Flying V.

     TIGHT ON WAYNE

     --sprawled out on the metal floor. He gropes around, his 
     hands feeling something. It sends chills from his groin 
     up through his scalp.

                    WAYNE
          No no no...

     REVERSE ANGLE

     Wayne's hands are touching J.J.'S BLOODY FACE, A LARGE 
     CRACK IN HER SKULL. He doesn't have time to scream or cry 
     because

     JASON

     hoists him off of J.J.'s body and flings him into:

     THE SHIP CIRCUIT PANEL (EFX)

     which shorts out with a fanfare of ELECTRICAL SPARKS 
     AND FIRE, INSTANTLY FRYING WAYNE.

     INT. BRIDGE - SAME TIME

     as the overhead lights briefly flicker, then resume 
     normal operation. Sean stands opposite the navigational 
     chart, ping-ponging between it and the ship's 
     computers as Miss Van Deusen paces nervously.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          What was that??

                    SEAN
               (very worried)
          I don't know.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
               (trying not to panic)
          What happens if we don't get control 
          of the ship, Sean? I want you to tell 
          me the truth.

                    SEAN
               (beat)
          We could hit a reef, collide with 
          another ship...we could be out here 
          for weeks before anybody spotted us.

     They are suddenly jolted with a DOOR SLAM as McCulloch 
     storms onto the bridge.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          Did you find Rennie?

                    MCCULLOCH
          She's locked safe in her room, no 
          thanks to either of you.
               (like Sean isn't even in the 
               room)
          Has he brought it back on course yet?

     Sean doesn't look at him, still trying to assimilate the 
     wall of components.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          He's doing the best he can, Charles.

                    MCCULLOCH
          He's the son of the Captain, for 
          Chrissakes. You'd think he'd be able 
          to operate this thing!

     Sean closes his eyes, trying to keep from losing his mind 
     and temper. A fierce WAVE slaps the windows in front of 
     Sean's face, motivating him to get his shit together. He 
     checks the Omega and LORAN.

                    MCCULLOCH
          Well?

     Sean doesn't answer, moving to the seat behind the helm. 
     His father's seat. Sean takes the chair, adjusting the 
     wheel, watching the compass. He studies a series of 
     buttons on the console.

     CLOSE UP - WALL OF BUTTONS

     We PAN across them, stopping on one labeled "FIRE ALARM - 
     DO NOT BREAK EXCEPT IN CASE OF EMERGENCY." Camera 
     continues around to find we are in the POWER ROOM, NOT on 
     the bridge. Our vision suddenly lands on JASON, staring 
     at the alarm button, considering. He glances back over 
     his shoulder.

     JASON'S POINT OF VIEW (EFX)

     Wayne's body is NOW ON FIRE...AND THE BLAZE IS SPREADING 
     THROUGH THE ROOM.

     INT. BRIDGE - SAME TIME

     as Sean makes up his mind, flipping several toggle 
     switches.

     INSERT - AUTO PILOT COMPUTER

     as Sean flips the last toggle and a green light 
     illuminates, indicating the AUTO PILOT is in effect.

     RETURN TO SHOT

                    SEAN
          It worked...we're back on course!

     Sean feels his confidence instantly rejuvenated. Miss Van 
     Deuten immediately embraces him. But a fraction of time 
     later:

     TIGHT ON FIRE ALARM BUTTON

     Jason's fist SMASHES the alarm button...

     INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

     ...and a LOUD SIREN cries out across the entire vessel. 
     The blood drains from Sean's face.

                    MCCULLOCH
          What's that?

                    SEAN
          The fire alarm...

     VARIOUS ANGLES ON BOARD SHIP - NIGHT

     as the shrieking alarm assaults the main deck, hallways 
     and corridors, giving Julius, Miles and Wayne deep 
     pause for thought.

     INT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME

     as the alarm bombards Rennie's ears like everybody 
     else's. She hurries to her curtained porthole window, 
     working up the energy to look outside. Rennie gets a grip 
     on them, FLINGING THEM OPEN. The DECK HAND'S CRAZED FACE 
     IS GAZING BACK AT HER. Rennie screams; a second later he 
     hurries off.

     INT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

     as McCulloch tears open a cabinet door labeled EMERGENCY 
     FLARE GUN. The siren continues to blast.

                    MCCULLOCH
          Can you shut that damn thing off??

     Sean moves to a bank of switches, his eyes darting around 
     for the appropriate switch. Miss Van Deusen sees 
     McCulloch remove the FLARE GUN from the cabinet.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          We already thought of that -- nobody 
          could possibly see it in this storm...

                    MCCULIACH
          There's only one person who needs to 
          see it. And I'm going to find him.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          What about the fire??

                    MCCULLOCH
          I doubt very much that one even 
          exists.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          What are you talking about?

                    MCCULLOCH
          Use some common sense! Setting off a 
          fire alarm causes panic...the same 
          kind of panic caused by suggesting 
          Jason Voorhees is on board.
               (resolved)
          Enough is enough. 

     He marches out the door. Sean finds the alarm kill 
     switch, flipping it. The excruciating siren vanishes. He 
     grabs a pair of rain jackets, tossing one to Miss Van 
     Deusen.

                    SEAN
          We have to get everybody together just 
          in case the fire's for real.

     Sean heads for the door, shoving it forward.

     EXT. DECK - ON DOOR

     as it slams open...and JULIUS steps out, not Sean, from a 
     different deck door. TRACK with him as he treads along 
     the side of the ship, skeet rifle raised.

     JULIUS' POINT OF VIEW

     walking past the lifeboat stations, the wind and 
     precipitation battering the small boats. With no warning, 
     AN OBSCURE FIGURE LEAPS OUT, GRIPPING AN AXE.

     JULIUS

     shoves the gun stock into his shoulder and takes 
     instantaneous aim...but he doesn't shoot. He slowly 
     lowers the rifle.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     as MILES lowers the axe. They've just scared the shit out 
     of each other.

                    MILES
          I'll take the upper deck.

     Julius nods. They separate. Neither boy notices the 
     smoke which is starting to emerge from a deck vent...

     INT. POWER ROOM - NIGHT (EFX)

     Filled with black smoke. The fire is spreading 
     dangerously close to a series of hoses attached to a fuel 
     pump, leading to tanks below. A sign over them reads: 
     DANGER - FUEL TANKS.

     EXT. DECK POOL - NIGHT

     --steaming and far from calm as the weather blitzes it. 
     Miles appears, climbing a ladder to the upper deck level.

     POINT OF VIEW THROUGH LADDER

     Someone is spying on Miles from below, watching his every 
     step.

     EXT. UPPER DECK - CONTINUOUS

     as Miles arrives, axe raised. He pauses to regard his 
     surroundings, then moves on. RACK FOCUS TO FIND JASON 
     RIGHT BEHIND HIM, having followed Miles up the stairs.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     Only darkness and rain for a beat, then Miles 
     materializes, curving around the gargantuan smokestack. 
     He passes us and we SWING AROUND, now looking at the back 
     of his head. He takes three more steps and JASON STEPS 
     INTO THE FOREGROUND. Miles senses his presence and JERKS 
     AROUND, RAISING THE AXE, BRINGING IT DOWN ON JASON'S 
     HEAD...

     ...but Jason easily grabs the axe handle before it makes 
     contact, flinging it away.

     EXT. LOWER DECK - ON JULIUS

     He's pacing along when a clattering noise from above 
     makes him stop. Suddenly MILES' AXE THUDS INTO THE 
     MAHOGANY DECK NEXT TO HIS FOOT. Julius gazes at it, 
     jerking his head upward.

                    JULIUS
          Miles??

     His answer is a LOUD CRACK OF LIGHTNING. At the same 
     time:

     RUNNING WITH MILES

     He's scrambling as fast as he can across the slippery 
     deck as the monster relentlessly pursues him.

     JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

     He's having no problem catching up to the defenseless 
     teenager.

     EXT. DECK STAIRS - SAME TIME

     as Julius zooms up them to aid his comrade.

     EXT. RADAR MAST - NIGHT

     as Miles slides up to the mast and begins scaling it. He 
     glances downward and sees:

     MILES' POINT OF VIEW

     Jason is right at his heels.

     MILES

     slips on a rung, regains control, and continues upward. 
     He makes it three more steps, almost at the uppermost 
     point when JASON GRABS THE BACK OF HIS COAT, TEARING HIM 
     OFF THE MAST.

     STUNT FREEFALL

     Miles cries out as he FREEFALLS BACKWARDS, somersaulting 
     and twisting like he's doing one of his better dives...

     CLOSE UP - MILES' FACE  

     ...Empty space for a half-second, then MILES' FACE JOLTS 
     INTO FRAME with a look of ultimate agony. Something has 
     abruptly stopped his fall. Something quite fatal.

     EXT. DECK - ON JULIUS

     coming around a corner, stopping dead in his tracks, his 
     stomach wrenching as his eyes fall on:

     MILES (EFX)

     ...who is staring right back at him with dead pupils. 
     MILES HAS BEEN HORRIBLY IMPALED OM A SHIP FLAGPOLE.

     JULIUS

     doesn't get the chance to grasp the reality of it because 
     JASON'S HAND GRIPS HIS SHOULDER, SPINS HIM AROUND AND 
     SLUGS HIM SQUARELY IN THE FACE. The force of it sends the 
     boxer REELING BACKWARDS OFF THE RAILING...

     EXT. STORMY OCEAN (TANK)

     ...and Julius SPLASHES INTO THE ROUGH SEA. He's quickly 
     swallowed by the torrential waters.

     INT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

     as Rennie's HAND jiggles her doorknob again, confirming 
     that it's locked tight. RISE to find her desperate face; 
     she begins furiously pacing and we DOLLY BEHIND HER 
     ...but Rennie stops cold upon hearing:

                    YOUNG JASON (O.S.)
          Hhhhelp....me....

     Rennie whirls into a CLOSE UP, staring with disbelief at:

     YOUNG JASON (EFX)

     ...who is standing on the oval rug in her stateroom, his 
     hands reaching out to her. But then comes the 
     inexplicable: THE OVAL RUG TURNS INTO LAKE WATER AND 
     JASON SINKS INTO IT. He's drowning in the middle of her 
     room, choking on murky water.

                    YOUNG JASON
          Hhhhelp me....I'm drowning...

     RENNIE

     stands frozen, feeling herself drawn to him like a 
     magnet. She crawls to the edge of her rug, which is now a 
     deep lake, and extends her arms to him.

     YOUNG JASON

     grabs her hand, pulling hard, then grinning wide.

     RENNIE

     feels the skin on her face crawling off her skull, her 
     eyes expanding because she's now looking at:

     HERSELF!

     Rennie is holding onto herself, about four years younger 
     in a bathing suit, drowning in the lake. YOUNG RENNIE.

                    YOUNG RENNIE
          Hhhhelp....me....

     RENNIE

     screams with guttural fear, letting go of herself, 
     watching her younger self drown in the hole in her room.

     YOUNG RENNIE

     disappears under the surface of the water...which seconds 
     later CHANGES BACK INTO HER OVAL RUG.

     NEW ANGLE

     as Rennie moves away, tears rolling down her face, 
     utterly confused. She backs against the wall next to her 
     porthole window and THE REAL JASON'S FIST SMASHES THROUGH 
     THE WINDOW, GRABBING HER THROAT. Rennie struggles, 
     gasping for air as he attempts to strangle her.

     CLOSE ON RENNIE'S HAND

     groping for a weapon to stop him, her fingers skittering 
     across her table like a spider.

     TWO SHOT - RENNIE AND JASON

     Her head is pulled taut against the wall just below the 
     porthole, with Jason's hideous mask framed in the 
     circular shattered window. She's slowly dying.

     CLOSE ON RENNIE'S HAND

     Her movements slow as the oxygen leaves her system. But 
     Rennie's fingers miraculously find a recognizable object: 
     the ink-dip pen given to her by Miss Van Deusen. She 
     seizes it, getting a firm grip.

     CLOSE ON JASON

     as Rennie JABS THE PEN BACKWARDS, SENDING THE SHARP 
     INSTRUMENT THROUGH THE EYEHOLE OF HIS MASK. Jason 
     instantly releases her, reeling backwards.

     RENNIE

     sinks to the floor, scrambling on all fours to get as far 
     away from the porthole as possible. She makes it across 
     the room to her stateroom door just as:

     THE DOOR

     is SLAMMED OPEN FROM THE OTHER SIDE. She shrieks in 
     terror but it's SEAN who is standing there.

                    SEAN
          Rennie...??

                    RENNIE
               (pointing)
          The window...

     Sean rushes to the shattered porthole, looking out, 
     seeing nothing. He steps back to her.

                    RENNIE
          I don't understand what is happening 
          to me...

     She breaks down; he holds her.

                    SEAN
          It's gonna be okay...

     INT. POWER ROOM - NIGHT (EFX)

     ...but Sean couldn't be more wrong. The flames are 
     lapping at the fuel pump and hoses, furiously burning 
     down into the tank. A second later the whole thing 
     EXPLODES IN A BALL OF FIRE.

     EXT. SHIP HULL - UNDERWATER (EFX/MODEL?)

     as a huge HOLE is blown through the thick steel hull:

     INT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME

     The ship noticeably rocks from the explosion. Rennie 
     clings to him fearfully.

                    RENNIE
          What is it??

     One second later, the lights begin to flicker.

                    SEAN  
          The power room...

     INT. POWER ROOM - SAME TIME (EFX)

     as huge amounts of water rush in from a gaping hole in 
     the hull.

     INT. SHIP KITCHEN - SAME TIME

     as the overhead lights flicker over McCulloch. There's 
     some fear mixed with the anger as he grips his flare gun, 
     moving onward.

     PONT OF VIEW FROM KITCHEN OVENS

     Someone is crouched behind a massive convection oven, 
     spying on McCulloch.

     MCCULLOCH

     almost flinches when the lights die and he's plunged 
     into blackness. He moves forward, every step tentative. 
     He passes the convection ovens and we REMAIN on them, 
     spotting the frightened face of the DECK HAND in the 
     shadows. The deranged old man is very sober now, 
     clutching a LARGE KITCHEN KNIFE for defense.

     INT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME

     Sean paces feverishly in the blackness of her room, 
     trying to think, talking to himself.

                    SEAN
          Rule one, don't panic. Rule two, 
          assess the damage and act 
          accordingly...

                    RENNIE
          Is the ship going to sink??

     He returns to Rennie, the panic settling back in.

                    SEAN
          I don't know.

     Her ultimate fear is staring her straight in the face. 
     Suddenly the dim blue lights flicker on.

                    SEAN
          The emergency lights just kicked in...

     Sean makes Rennie look into his eyes. His words are meant 
     to convince himself as much as Rennie.

                    SEAN
          We'll be okay. I want you to wait by 
          the lifeboats, just in case.

                    RENNIE
               (terrified)
          I'm not going near any lifeboat!

                    SEAN
          But Rennie...

                    RENNIE
          I'm not!!

     INT. SHIP RESTAURANT ROOM - SAME TIME

     as Miss Van Deusen gathers a handful of students who are 
     panicking, sitting them down.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          Everybody wait right here until I come 
          back with the others -- understand?

     They nod, frightened to death. She dashes away, carrying 
     us into a view of the dining room windows. No one 
     notices the SILHOUETTE OF JASON passing by on the outside 
     desk.

     INT. ENGINE ROOM - SAME TIME (EFX)

     Sea water is pouring into the ship's motors. Clouds of 
     steam and black smoke fill the room as the engine 
     bearings begin to GRIND.

     INT. SHIP HALLWAY - SAME TIME

     as McCulloch rushes up to Rennie's already open door, 
     cautiously entering with flare gun raised.

                    MCCULLOCH
          Rennie??

     MCCULLOCH'S POINT OF VIEW

     The room is empty, shards of the porthole glass scattered 
     across her rug. He steps over to it, bringing his head up 
     to the gaping hole, peering outside. We wait for his 
     attack...but it doesn't come. McCulloch's eyes take us to 
     something across the room. The bathroom door is afar.

     MCCULLOCH

     cautiously steps up to the door, silently grabbing the 
     knob and SWINGING IT OPEN. It's empty. He hears 
     something, spinning around. Again, nothing is there. 
     McCulloch quickly moves to the telephone and dials. A few 
     seconds pass.

                    MCCULLOCH
          Come on, answer!!

     INT. BRIDGE - SAME TIME

     TIGHT on the bridge telephone, ringing repeatedly. RISE 
     TO FIND JASON, ignoring the phone, scrutinizing the deck 
     below through rain-streaked windows.

     JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

     Miss Van Deusen is darting across the deck, gathering up 
     a trio of terrified seniors.

     RETURN TO SHOT

     Jason methodically moves to the bank of switches, 
     studying them.

     INSERT - CONSOLE

     In large, unmistakable letters over a red button are the 
     words "ABANDON SHIP ALARM." He flips back the plastic 
     safety cover, exposing the button.

     INT. BOWELS OF SHIP - SAME TIME  

     A horrible grinding sound echoes through the narrow 
     corridor. Sean and Rennie appear at the opposite end, 
     coughing on the black smoke which clouds their 
     passageway. Sean looks down, seeing that they are 
     standing in a puddle of water.

                    SEAN
          Water has gotten to the engines.
               (coughs)
          We have to get everybody off this 
          ship...

     INSERT - ABANDON SHIP BUTTON

     as Jason presses it with firm deliberation, and:

     INT. BOWELS OF SHIP - CONTINUOUS

     A WHOOPING SIREN blasts through the passageway. Sean and 
     Rennie have no time to react because:

     ANGLE - CORRIDOR (EFX)

     A sealed compartment door EXPLODES OPEN WITH THE PRESSURE 
     OF SEA WATER...

     REVERSE ANGLE (EFX)

     ...and a WALL OF WATER ENGULFS.RENNIE AND SEAN, KNOCKING 
     THEM DOWN. Sean fights to pull her up, but not in time 
     for her to witness:

     WAYNE'S CHARRED CORPSE (EFX)

     which bobs up in front of her. Rennie cries out, 
     scrambling to grab onto Sean as what's left of Wayne's 
     body washes past them.

     EXT. DECK - NIGHT

     as a door opens and Miss Van Deusen guides a half-dozen 
     SENIORS over to the LIFEBOAT STATIONS.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
               (shouting over storm)
          Everybody climb in!

     They follow her orders as the Abandon Ship alarm wretches 
     on. But little do they know that:

     STALKING POINT OF VIEW

     Someone is briskly moving towards the group and Miss Van 
     Deusen. Just as we are within a few feet of her... 

     REVERSE ANGLE

     --It's MCCULLOCH who's approached them. He grabs Miss Van 
     Deusen, shaking her violently.

                    MCCULLOCH
          What did you do with Rennie??

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          Nothing! I went to her cabin and...

     McCulloch rushes off before she can finish. Miss Van 
     Deusen turns back to the other kids, helping them into 
     the boat.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          Everybody hurry...please...

     EXT. DECK - CLOSE ON MAHOGANY DECKING - SAME TIME

     We slowly DOLLY BACKWARDS until Miles' AXE comes into 
     frame, still stuck in the mahogany decking. A beat, then 
     JASON'S HALAL DISLODGES IT FROM THE WOOD.

     INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

     as Sean climbs up from below, soaked to the bone, pulling 
     up a half-conscious Rennie. Sean carries her around a 
     corner, where he collides with McCulloch. McCulloch 
     pulls Rennie away from him.

                    MCCULLOCH
          She never should've set foot on this 
          ship. This is your fault!

                    SEAN
          This is Jason's fault!

                    MCCULLOCH
               (shouting)
          Not another word, do you hear me??

     EXT. LIFEBOAT STATIONS - NIGHT

     as Miss Van Deusen throws the "down" lever and the 
     lifeboat hoist begins to lower the boat. Camera SLOWLY 
     CREEPS IN A SEMI-CIRCLE AS A SILHOUETTED FIGURE STEPS 
     INTO A POOL OF LIGHT BEHIND HER. JASON.

     ANGLE - LIFEBOAT  

     One of the students screams, the others clinging together 
     upon the sight of this infamous monster. But the boat is 
     already over the edge, past the point of return. And 
     lowering at a snail's pace.

     MISS VAN DEUSEN

     turns to see JASON APPROACHING THEM WITH AXE RAISED. She 
     backs away but Jason ignores her, heading directly for 
     the hoist. He arches back with his weapon and SLICES 
     DOWNWARD.

     INSERT - HOIST CABLE (SECOND UNIT)

     as Jason's axe CHOPS THE CABLE IN TWO, and:

     EXT. SHIP/OCEAN (TANK)

     The bow cable SNAPS, DUMPING THE HALF DOZEN TEENAGERS 
     INTO THE TURBULENT SALT WATER. They last about five 
     seconds before succumbing to a drowning death.

     MISS VAN DEUSEN

     sees it all, her intestines constricting in agonizing 
     knots. She summons all her rationale and sends it down to 
     her legs, running away as fast as she can.

     MISS VAN DEUSEN'S POINT OF VIEW

     --knocking down deck tables, chairs and chaise lounges as 
     she flees. The creative writing teacher swerves around a 
     column, heading for an interior door, sliding to a stop 
     as it BANGS OPEN IN FRONT OF HER. McCulloch steps 
     outside, carrying Rennie, with Sean right behind her. 
     Rennie is conscious now, squirming free of her uncle upon 
     the sight of Miss Van Deusen.

     ANGLE TO INCLUDE ALL

     as Rennie rushes into Miss Van Deusen's arms. The teacher 
     holds her, beginning to cry herself.

                    MCCULLOCH
          Why aren't you with the others, 
          woman??

     Finally the message comes forth:

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          Jason...he has an axe...

     His face grows taut with anger.

                    MCCULLOCH
          Jason Voorhees is dead!!

     A PRIMAL SCREAM OF AGONY immediately cries out behind 
     them, the words unintelligible. They turn around to 
     witness THE DECK HANG STAGGERING TOWARDS THEM, GRIPPING 
     THE KITCHEN KNIFE. 

     MCCULLOCH

     raises the flare gun with zero hesitation and FIRES IT...

     ANGLE - DECK HAND (EFX)

     ...and the charge EXPLODES INTO HIS CHEST. He stands 
     there with his chest smoldering, almost like a gargoyle 
     in effigy. A second later the poor old man falls forward, 
     and:

     CLOSE ON HIS BACK (EFX)

     They all see that JASON'S AXE HAS BEEN BURIED IN HIS 
     BACK.

     RETURN TO MASTER

     McCulloch gazes with utter disbelief.

                    MCCULLOCH
          Dear Christ...

                    SEAN
          We have to get off this ship!!

     They back away from the horrid sight and begin to run, 
     the Abandon Ship alarm still attacking their ears.

     EXT. LIFEBOAT STATIONS - NIGHT

     as McCulloch, Miss Van Deusen, Rennie and Sean scramble 
     to the closest lifeboat.

                    SEAN
          Everybody in -- I'll get the hoists

     McCulloch has no time for politeness, moving to the 
     lifeboat ahead of the women. Rennie stops cold, gazing 
     classy-eyed at the small boat.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          Come on, sweetheart -- get in...

     But she doesn't budge. McCulloch levels wild eyes on her, 
     quickly climbing back down.

                    MCCULLOCH
          Get in the boat, Rennie!

                    RENNIE
          I...I can't...

                    MCCULLOCH
               (shaking her)
          You can and you will!!

     He tries to slap her out of it, dragging her over to the 
     boat, ignoring her terror-stricken frenzy.

                    SEAN
          Stop it!!

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          Leave her alone, Charles!

     Miss Van Deusen quickly moves to a hysterical Rennie and 
     holds her, eyeing McCulloch vehemently.

     EXT. DECK - TIGHT ON DEAD DECK HAND - SAME TIME

     as rain begins to wash the blood from his back. JASON'S 
     FOOT TRUDGES INTO FRAME...then his HAND REACHES DOWN, 
     RETRIEVING HIS AXE FROM THE DECK HAND'S SPINE.

     EXT. LIFEBOAT STATIONS - SAME TIME

     as Rennie clings to      Miss Van Deusen, crying.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          It's the only way, Rennie. Let's get 
          in the boat now, okay? Please...for 
          me?

     Rennie finds herself nodding. Miss Van Deusen helps the 
     trembling girl up the steps, an angered McCulloch right 
     behind.

     INT. LIFEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

     as Rennie climbs over the boat edge, RECOILING AT THE 
     SOUND OF A SNARLING DOG. Toby is curled up in the 
     corner of the lifeboat, teeth bared.

                    RENNIE
          Toby...

     She climbs in, moving to her equally, relieved dog, 
     McCulloch and Miss Van Deusen right behind her.

     INSERT - HOIST BUTTON (SECOND UNIT)

     as Sean jabs it and the hoist motor kicks in.

     EXT. SHIP - WIDE SHOT (EFX)

     just as a huge BOLT OF LIGHTNING cracks over the smoke 
     stack and upper deck. JASON steps out from behind it, 
     gaping down on them with frightening omnipresence. 
     Gripping the bloody axe.

     EXT. LIFEBOAT STATIONS - CONTINUOUS

     Sean climbs in the boat as it continues to lower. He 
     takes one look back at the ship and sees:

     JASON

     rapidly moving down the staircase towards them. Sean's 
     view is CUT OFF as the lifeboat sinks below deck level.

     RETURN TO SHOT

     as Sean's eyes dart around, down to the sea, up at the 
     hoist.

                    SEAN
          Come on...faster....

     JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

     trampling towards the hoist, about thirty feet away now. 
     The boat has already disappeared over the edge.

     EXT. SHIP/STORMY SEA - NIGHT (TANK)

     as the lifeboat continues to lower, about ten feet from 
     making contact with the tumultuous ocean. The ship's hull 
     is crooked and sinking.

     TRACKING WITH JASON

     as he relentlessly moves to the hoist cable, raising his 
     axe.

     EXT. SHIP/STORMY SEA (TANK)

     as the ship finally touches water, and:

     INSERT - HOIST CABLE (SECOND UNIT

     Jason's axe blade CHOPS THE CABLE...

     EXT. SHIP/STORMY SEA (TANK)

     ...and the hoist cable falls limply over them. Jason's 
     too late. Sean looks up and sees:

     JASON

     standing by the hoist, hovering over the edge. Very 
     angry.

     SEAN (TANK)

     grabs an oar, turning back to McCulloch.

                    SEAN
          Start rowing!!

     McCulloch takes the oar as Miss Van Deusen holds onto 
     Rennie tightly, the girl's eyes squeezed shut. Sean looks 
     up at the ship again, and:

     SEAN'S POINT OF VIEW

     Jason is none.

     EXT. SHIP/STORMY SEA (TANK)

     Sean looks around with confusion as huge waves, wind and 
     rain pummel them.

                    SEAN
          He's gone...

     POINT OF VIEW FROM WATER (TANK)

     ...or is he? We're moving towards the lifeboat at water 
     level, almost like a shark preparing for attack.

     INT. LIFEBOAT (TANK)

     Sean breathes with some relief, resuming his rowing with 
     McCulloch. They get about three strokes apiece before:

     A DARK FIGURE (TANK)

     lunges from under the ocean surface, grabbing onto 
     Sean. Everybody SCREAMS...but it's JULIUS, gasping for 
     oxygen, spitting up seawater. Sean pulls him over the 
     edge.

                    SEAN
          It's Julius!

     Miss Van Deusen moves to help him and we:

                                         SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. STORMY OCEAN - WIDE SHOT - DAY (SECOND UNIT)

     The ship is gone now, the lifeboat a speck in the ocean.

     INT. LIFEBOAT - DAY (OCEAN?)

     The water is less rough now, the rain replaced with fog. 
     Julius has taken McCulloch's place behind an oar; 
     McCulloch is flanking his shivering niece with Miss Van 
     Deusen.

                    MCCULLOCH
               (miserable)
          If we don't find the shore soon we're 
          all going to die.

     Sean tries to ignore him, keeping his mind on rowing.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
               (unable to hide fear)
          Do you know where we are, Sean?

     Sean pauses, utterly exhausted. He thinks for a moment, 
     remembering his father's gift. Sean reaches into his coat 
     pocket, removing the pocket navigational calculator. He 
     stares at it long and hard. Julius looks over at him, 
     seeing that Sean is on the verge of tears. He grips his 
     shoulder.

                    JULIUS
          Hey man, if I can make it, so can. 
          you.

     Sean slowly nods, turning on the calculator.

                                          SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT (TANK)

     as the lifeboat rows into frame, the water relatively 
     calm.

     INT. LIFEBOAT - NIGHT (TANK)

     McCulloch, Rennie and Miss Van Deusen are asleep, Sean 
     and Julius rowing on sheer will power. Sean takes one 
     more stroke, feels himself passing out, then regains his 
     coherence again. Julius glances off the side of the ship 
     for no particular reason, then does a doubletake.

     JULIUS' POINT OF VIEW (SECOND UNIT - N.Y.)

     They are rowing right past THE STATUE OF LIBERTY, 
     illuminated in all its glory.

     INT. LIFEBOAT (TANK)

     Julius feels his eyes widening and a huge smile taking 
     control of his haggard face. He tugs on Sean's sleeve, 
     his eyes never leaving the monument.

                    JULIUS
          Hey man, wake up! Check it out!!

     The other stir as well, opening their eyes, not sure if 
     it's some kind of vision or if they are genuinely here.

                    JULIUS
          God damn, we're in New York! You did 
          it, my man!!

     Julius howls with delight, Miss Van Deusen hugging Rennie 
     as Julius gives Sean the high-five. Toby barks.

     WIDE SHOT - NEW YORK HARBOR - NIGHT (SECOND UNIT - N.Y.)

     as the lifeboat rows toward the very famous skyline of 
     Manhattan, twinkling in the near distance. We can hear 
     the faint sound of Julius singing "New York, New York," 
     relieved to be alive. They're going to make it.

     EXT. EMPTY OCEAN - ANOTHER ANGLE (TANK)

     as the sound of Julius' voice grows fainter. The water 
     begins to ripple...then the top half of a HOCKEY MASK 
     BREAKS THE SURFACE FOR A BREATH OF AIR, SINKING AGAIN. 
     And swimming onward.

     EXT. CANNERY HARBOR - NIGHT

     as Julius and Sean row the lifeboat up to a narrow barge 
     beneath deserted dock warehouses. They are not in the 
     safest part of town by a longshot.

     CLOSER ANGLE

     as they climb onto the barge. Rennie breathes with relief 
     as she steps off the boat. She takes a final glance back 
     at it and sees:

     YOUNG RENNIE

     flailing her arms in the water right next to the 
     lifeboat, drowning.

                    YOUNG RENNIE
          Hhhhelp...me....

     Suddenly a DECOMPOSED HAND REACHES UP FROM BELOW, 
     GRABBING HER, DRAGGING HER UNDER.

     EXT. BARGE - ON RENNIE

     She gazes in utter shock, screaming:

                    RENNIE
          No!!!

     They all follow her eyeline...but the water is calm, 
     nothing there.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
               (holding her)
          It's okay...you're safe now...

     McCulloch grits his teeth.

                    MCCULLOCH
          Come on -- everybody up the ladder.

     He's the first one up. Sean looks at Rennie, concerned, 
     then hoists Toby up in his arms. They all begin climbing 
     the ladder.

     CLOSE ON LADDER - NIGHT

     as the last pair of feet disappear over the top edge of 
     the dock. Camera PANS back down the rungs, finding the 
     lifeboat and barge again. Suddenly JASON SPRINGS FROM THE 
     WATER, CLIMBING ONTO THE BARGE. He gazes up at his new 
     surroundings, quite different from all the years he's 
     spent at Crystal Lake. But an item at the far end of the 
     dock causes him the longest pause...

     JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

     A tattered billboard over one of the warehouses 
     advertises the NEW YORK RANGERS HOCKEY TEAM, featuring a 
     full shot of the HOCKEY-MASKED GOALIE.

     JASON

     looks at it long and hard. He tears off his life 
     preserver wits renewed ambition.

     WIDE SHOT - BARGE AND DOCK WAREHOUSES - NIGHT

     as Jason heads up the ladder. He's about to take 
     Manhattan.

     EXT. CANNERY WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT  

     as our survivors head into an isolated, foreboding group 
     of dock warehouses and alleys.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          There must be a phone around here 
          somewhere.

                    MCCULLOCH
          A wonderful choice of places to dock a 
          boat, Mr. Robertson.

     Sean looks away, trying to keep from losing his temper.

     PREDATOR'S POINT OF VIEW - SAME TIME

     We're spying on them from behind a stack of crates as 
     they come in our direction. Waiting for the right moment.

     RETURN TO SHOT

     as they move towards the stack of crates. Without 
     warning, a PAIR OF GANG BANGERS JUMP OUT, BOTH HOLDING 
     GUNS. Nervous young druggies.

                    GANG RANGER #1
          Hands up!!

                    GANG BANGER #2  
          Do it!!

     All hands go up. Gang Banger #2 grabs McCulloch's watch 
     and wallet, skimming through a wad of bills and credit 
     cards while #1 keeps them covered.

                    GANG BANGER #2
          Got some good shit here, holmes.

                    GANG BANGER #1
               (eyeing Rennie)
          You got that right...

     He steps over to Rennie, brushing her hair back with the 
     barrel of his revolver, spotting the Statue of Liberty 
     pendant Sean gave her.

                    GANG BANGER #L
          Now ain't that sweet.

     He tears it off her neck, pocketing it. Sean angrily 
     moves toward him and Gang Banger #l shoves the barrel 
     against Rennie's temple.

                    GANG BANGER #1
          Go ahead, superman. Be a hero.

     Sean has no choice but to freeze. Julius flexes his 
     fists, but he too has Gang Banger #2's gun leveled on 
     him. McCulloch stares at the thugs with obvious contempt. 
     It doesn't go unnoticed.

                    GANG BANGER #L
          You got a problem, Dad?

     McCulloch offers some rare silence, shaking a "no" to the 
     gun-toting kid. Rennie's dog-begins to growl, backing 
     away, ready to defend her. Gang Banger #1 points his 
     barrel at Toby with zero conscience, cocking back the 
     hammer.

                    RENNIE
          No!

     She pushes his arm to the side just as the bullet 
     FIRES...

     ANGLE - TOBY

     as the bullet tears up asphalt next to the dog's paws. 
     Toby sprints off into the darkness.

     RETURN TO SHOT

     Gang Banger #1 grabs Rennie by the hair, brutally jerking 
     her head back.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          Please, don't hurt her...

                    GANG BANGER #L
          Hurt this princess?
               (beat)
          Would I do that?

     They cough out laughs. Gang Banger #1 looks into Rennie's 
     eyes, his barrel still on her skin.

                    GANG BANGER #1
          You look like a party girl, princess. 
          How'd you like to go on a date with me 
          and my friend? If you're free, that 
          is.

     More phlegm-filled laughs. He drags her away, Gang Banger 
     #2 backing away with him with his gun still trained on 
     the others.

                    GANG BANGER #2
          You follow and we'll blow her fuckin' 
          head off, comprende?

     The others watch helplessly as Rennie is abducted.

                    JULIUS
          We can't let those gang-bangers get 
          away, man...

     Julius starts to move after them. McCulloch grabs him.

                    MCCULLOCH
          You heard him! We have to call the 
          police

     Julius jerks away from McCulloch's grasp. But he knows 
     McCulloch     is right.

                    MCCULLOCH
          Everyone split up -- we'll cover more 
          ground that way.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          I don't think that's such a safe idea

                    MCCULLOCH
          My niece's life hangs in the balance 
          right now!! Every second counts.

     No more rebuttal. They hurry off.

     EXT. GANG BANGER'S LAIR - NIGHT

     It's a narrow passageway between warehouses...decrepit 
     brownstones with shattered chicken-wire windows, moss 
     growing on the bricks. The Gang Bangers appear with 
     Rennie, dragging her down some concrete steps.

                    GANG BANGER #L
          Welcome to the casbah, princess.

     PAN AROUND with them as they walk through a thick blanket 
     of STEAM which pours out of a factory vent. We MOVE 
     through the mist with them, revealing a tattered, rain-
     soaked couch and chair, upholstery shredded. A spool once 
     used for telephone wire functions as their coffee table. 
     They splash through puddles, throwing her down on the 
     couch.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     --looking back at the steam vent. JASON APPEARS IN THE 
     BILLOWING MIST.

     CLOSE UP - SYRINGE

     as a yellowish liquid squirts out the dirty needle. WIDEN 
     to find Gang Banger #2 holding it with transfixed eyes, 
     his compadre holding a squirming Rennie down on the 
     couch, tearing back her jacket to reveal a bare arm.

                    RENNIE
          Please don't...

                    GANG BANGER #1
          Loosen up, baby. It'll feel way
          better if you're stoned.

     CLOSE ON JASON'S FEET - SAME TIME

     Amongst the slime and cigarette butts is a discarded 
     syringe. Jason picks it up.

     CLOSER ANGLE - COUCH

     just as Gang Banger #2 jabs Rennie with the needle. 
     Gang Banger #1 wrestles off his torn leather jacket, 
     pushing Rennie back on the exposed foam padding as his 
     friend watches excitedly.

                    GANG BANGER #1
          Slang us some more 'caine, JoJo. We're 
          in for a long night.

     Gang Banger #2 runs out the back way. #1 tears open 
     Rennie's blouse, his filthy mouth moving to her neck. 
     Rennie spits in his face. He hesitates not in SLAPPING 
     HER HARD.

                    GANG BANGER #1
          It's your parade, princess. Can be 
          smooth or can be rough. Your choice.

     She closes .her eyes, trying to blot out what's about to 
     happen.

                    GANG BANGER #1
          I think I'm in love.

     PUSH IN on his face as his neck arches down, bringing his 
     lips toward her chest. Just before contact he GRUNTS 
     THICKLY, HIS EYES BUGGING OUT.

     WIDER ANGLE

     Jason is standing right behind him, shoving something 
     into his back, out of frame. He thrusts it again, 
     bringing with it one more horrific grunt from the kid. 
     Jason goes for number three and: 

     CLOSE UP - GANG BANGER #1'S CHEST (EFX)

     Jason's syringe gets shoved completely through him, the 
     needle sticking out his front side.

     RENNIE

     opens her eyes, looking into the dead boy's face as 
     blood drips from his mouth. He collapses in front of 
     her, giving way to a view of JASON TOWERING OVER HER. At 
     the same time:

     GANG BANGER #2

     comes around the corner.

                    GANG BANGER #2
          Forgot my money, holmes...

     Ha stops dead in his tracks at the sight of Jason.

                    GANG BANGER #2
          Who the fuck are you?

     Jason paces toward him. The kid glances at his dead 
     friend arched over the couch, quickly whipping out his 
     .38.

                    GANG BANGER #2
          You're dead, fuckhead.

     BANG!

     ...but Jason keeps on coming. Five shots later and 
     Jason's still standing, easily picking up the slime ball 
     and SHOVING HIM HEAD FIRST INTO THE MOSSY BRICK WALL. The 
     kid falls in a bloody heap.

     RENNIE

     shoves Gang Banger #1 off of her as Jason returns his 
     attention to her. She grabs a loose brick and FLINGS IT 
     AT HIM, CRACKING HIS HOCKEY MASK, momentarily 
     disorienting him. Rennie sprints away.

     EXT. ALLEY #1 - NIGHT (LONG LENS)

     as Julius runs into view, looking down a menacing alley, 
     spotting a phone booth. He hurries for it.

     PREDATOR'S POINT OF VIEW

     Like a cat watching a bird, we watch Julius head for the 
     booth.

     JULIUS

     slams open the booth door, grabbing the receiver, 
     punching the "operator" digit. SLOWLY PUSH IN on him as 
     he waits for an answer. Several more rings.

                    JULIUS
          C'mon...

     Finally a click and muffled words from the operator.

                    JULIUS
          Get me the police -- this is an 
          emergency...

                    

     SMASH! as JASON'S FIST CRASHES THROUGH THE BOOTH WINDOW, 
     GRABBING JULIUS BY THE THROAT. Julius grips Jason's scaly 
     arm with all his strength, staring at the cracked hockey 
     mask framed in the shattered window. Julius summons all 
     his strength, tearing free of Jason's grasp and running 
     out the door. The phone is left dangling.

     RUNNING WITH JULIUS (HAND HELD)

     with no apparent direction. Literally running for his 
     life.

     TRACKING WITH JASON

     He's just as quick, but smoother and more methodical.

     JULIUS' POINT OF VIEW (HAND HELD)

     heading up the alley, spotting a fire escape, diverting 
     his course straight for it.

     ANGLE - FIRE ESCAPE

     as Julius LEAPS ONTO IT, dragging himself up, climbing as 
     fast as is humanly possible.

     ANGLE - JASON

     ...but Jason is-far from human, easily negotiating the 
     wrought-iron stairs and rapidly catching up.

     EXT. ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS

     as Julius' head appears, clawing his way onto the tar-
     papered surface, running to the opposite side. A second 
     later, JASON HOPS UP RIGHT BEHIND HIM.

     REVERSE ANGLE

     as Julius soon learns the awful truth that the only way 
     up is the only way down...with the exception of a head-
     splitting freefall. No way is he gonna jump. Julius turns 
     back to Jason, raising his fists, psyching himself up for 
     the fight of his life. He whispers to himself:

                    JULIUS
          Use the combos and keep the feet 
          light...

     THE FIGHT BEGINS, man against monster, each sizing the 
     other up. 
     Jason takes the first swing, Julius deftly dodging him 
     and countering with left-right-left combination. They 
     have absolutely no effect. Julius follows up with a round 
     of kidney punches. Again, nothing. Julius finds himself 
     being forced back against the rings, which in this case 
     is the edge of the roof. He risks a glance backwards and 
     sees:

     JULIUS' POINT OF VIEW

     It's a long, rough way down. It's do or die time.

     RETURN TO SCENE

     as Julius SLAMS PUNCH AFTER PUNCH INTO JASON, forcing him 
     back to the center of the rooftop, spending every last 
     ounce of his energy in doing so. He throws one more 
     feeble punch, knowing it's his last.

                    JULIUS
          Take your best shot, motherfucker...

     Jason gladly obliges, winding up and recoiling with a 
     punch none of us expected...

     JULIUS' HEAD (EFX)

     gets literally knocked off his shoulders, cascading off 
     the edge of the rooftop, and:

     ANGLE - SLANTED LOWER ROOF

     --the decapitated head lands on a sloped roof below, 
     rolling down towards street level and falling into a 
     garbage-filled dumpster.

     EXT. ALLEY #2 - NIGHT  

     as Rennie dizzily runs down the alley, the effects of the 
     drugs kicking in.

     RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (POST EFX)

     Blurry, disoriented, erratic. Suddenly A FIGURE JUMPS OUT 
     FROM A CORRIDOR IN FRONT OF HER.

     RETURN TO SHOT

     It's SEAN. He rushes to her, sensing her disorientation.

                    SEAN
          Rennie...what'd they do to you??

                    RENNIE
          Drugs...
               (serious pause)
          Then Jason came. He's here, Sean.

     Oh Jesus. He never expected this.

                    SEAN
          We have to find the others.

     Together they run off.

     EXT. ALLEY #3 - NIGHT (OVERHEAD ANGLE)

     as Miss Van Deusen briskly walks below us, far from 
     relaxed in this threatening environment.

     TRACKING SHOT

     She moves forward, the only sound being her shoes against 
     wet asphalt. Four more steps, then a DARK, OUT OF FOCUS 
     FIGURE STEPS OUT BEHIND HER WITH A GUN.

                    VOICE
          Freeze.

     RACK FOCUS to find a uniformed IRISH COP standing there, 
     service revolver raised. McCulloch steps out from the 
     alcove as well, recognizing Miss Van Deusen.

                    MCCULLOCH
          It's okay -- she's with me.

     She turns around, lowering her hands, utterly relieved.

                    IRISH COP
          My apologies, Miss. My unit's right 
          over here.

     They head through an ABANDONED PARKING LOT towards a 
     concrete wall with stairs; about six feet above the wall 
     is an upper street, where his patrol car is parked. They 
     get halfway through the lot when they hear:

                    SEAN (O.S.)
          Hey!

     REVERSE ANGLE

     as Sean and Rennie run to join them from the alley. 
     McCulloch rushes to his niece.

                    MCCULLOCH
          Rennie, thank God...

     But Rennie goes to Miss Van Deusen instead. It's a bitter 
     pill for McCulloch.

                    SEAN
          Jason's here in New York.

                    MCCULLOCH
          Don't be ridiculous!

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          Is it true, Rennie??

     She nods, unable to repress her fear.

                    IRISH COP
          Is this the lass in question?

                    MCCULLOCH
               (stewing)
          Yes.

                    IRISH COP
          Who is...Jason?

                    MCCULLOCH
          He's a walking corpse, a phantasm from 
          hell.

     The others stare at McCulloch angrily. Miss Van Deusen 
     turns to the confused policeman.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
          I'm afraid you'll have some trouble 
          believing us.

                    IRISH COP
          So try me.

     EXT. SQUAD CAR - NIGHT

     parked above the abandoned garage, the interior dark. The 
     Cop and our heroes appear in the background, coming 
     towards it.

                    IRISH COP
          You're right -- I find it a tall tale 
          indeed. 
          But you seem like honest folks so I'm 
          inclined to believe at least some of 
          it.

                    MISS VAN DEUSEN
               (relieved)
          Thank you. The first thing we' have to 
          do is find Julius.

                    IRISH COP
          I'm sure he'll pop up soon enough. Why 
          don't you climb in the back while I 
          radio for backup.

     ADJUST INTO A FULL SHOT OF THE BACK DOOR AS HE SWINGS IT 
     OPEN...but even in this darkness, we see that it's 
     empty. They climb in. The Cop opens his drivers door, 
     and...

     INSERT - DOME LIGHT (SECOND UNIT)

     The car dome light blinks on, and...

     ANGLE - BACK SEAT

     Our four survivors' faces are brightly illuminated, 
     INSTANTLY CHANGING TO GASPS AND SCREAMS because:

     THEIR POINT OF VIEW (EFX)

     Julius' severed head is resting on the dash board, 
     staring back at them!!!

     ANGLE - COP

     reacting to their terror, seeing Julius' head, quickly 
     grabbing the radio mike. But he has no time for a message 
     because JASON REACHES UP FROM THE PARKING LOT PIT BELOW, 
     GRABBING THE COP'S ANKLE, DRAGGING HIM DOWN. The radio is 
     still in his grasp.

     INSERT - DISPATCH RADIO (SECOND UNIT)

     as the radio cord grows taut, finally snapping. The 
     Irish cop's awful yell echoes over it, silencing after a 
     sick THUD.

     INT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS

     The foursome instantly try to flee the car, but police 
     cars have no door handles in the back.

                    SEAN
          There aren't any handles!!

     Cocaine flowing through her veins, Rennie acts 
     hyperkinetically, scratching her way over the seats just 
     as:

     JASON

     appears at the parking lot stairs, STALKING STRAIGHT 
     TOWARDS THE CAR.

     INT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS

     There is no time for escape. Rennie finds the ignition 
     and fires it up, jamming it into drive and STOMPING ON 
     THE ACCELERATOR. Julius' head rolls off the dash, onto 
     the floorboards.

     RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (POST EFX)

     Her vision is still a stoned one but clear enough to set 
     her target. We come straight at the abominable creature 
     and:

     WHAM! (EFX)

     Jason is mowed down.

     RENNIE

     slams on the brakes, jerks it into reverse and FLOORS IT 
     AGAIN.

     CLOSE ON JASON (EFX)

     as the automobile grinds back over him a second time.

     RENNIE

     stomps on the brake pedal and the tires SCREECH TO A 
     HALT. They all take a moment to catch their breath, 
     looking out the front window...

     THEIR POINT OF VIEW

     Jason lies dead on the asphalt. For about two seconds. He 
     SLOWLY STANDS.

     RENNIE

     desperately throws it into forward again, gripping the 
     wheel and RACING FORWARD.

     POINT OF VIEW FROM FRONT BUMPER (STUNT DRIVE)

     Jason's standing there for one second, but the next 
     moment he is LEAPING OUT OF THE WAY...

     EXT. ABANDONED PARKING LOT (STUNT DRIVE)

     ...and the squad car SMASHES THROUGH A CHAIN LINK FENCE, 
     FREEFALLING TO THE ABANDONED PARKING LOT BELOW.

     EXT. ALLEY #3 - CONTINUOUS (STUNT DRIVE)

     as the car bottoms out, then swerves into a sharp right 
     turn, racing down the alley.

     POINT OF VIEW FROM FRONT BUMPER (STUNT DRIVE)

     as Jason appears at the end of the alley, blocking their 
     retreat.

     INT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS

     as Rennie stomps the brake pedal, jerking it into 
     reverse...

     EXT. ALLEY #3 - CONTINUOUS (STUNT DRIVE)

     as she backs up, changes gears and races down an 
     intersecting alley.

     POINT OF VIEW FROM FRONT BUMPER (STUNT DRIVE)

     speeding towards an escape when JASON POPS OUT AGAIN! 
     He's everywhere all at once...

     INT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS

     slamming on the discs one more time, flooring it into 
     reverse.

     CLOSE ON TIRES - CONTINUOUS (SECOND UNIT)

     as the squad car's rear tires smoke and spin, finally 
     gripping pavement.

     POINT OF VIEW OUT REAR WINDOW (STUNT DRIVE)

     as we fly backwards...and JASON APPEARS BEHIND THEM!!

     TIGHT ON REAR VIEW MIRROR

     --Rennie's terrified face filling it, seeing that Jason 
     is in back of them.

     TIGHT ON REAR TIRES (SECOND UNIT)

     as they screech to a halt one final time, rapidly 
     rotating in the opposite direction and speeding out of 
     frame.

     INT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS

     Rennie is almost maniacal now, her knuckles white around 
     the vinyl wheel, her foot practically mashed through the 
     floorboard.

                    MCCULLOCH
          Rennie, for God's sake slow down!!

     She doesn't hear him, or anything for that matter. Her 
     eyes remain straight ahead, never blinking.

     RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (POST EFX)

     There's a FIGURE standing in the distance. But it looks 
     too small to be Jason. We RUSH TOWARDS IT, CHANGING INTO 
     SLOW MOTION JUST BEFORE IMPACT. The figure is a dripping 
     wet boy with a sinister smile. YOUNG JASON.

     EXT. BRICK WALL - A SPLIT SECOND LATER (EFX)

     as the front of the squad car RAMS THE BRICK WALL HEAD-
     ON, THE HOOD BURSTING INTO FLAMES.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     as the front passenger door is shoved open by Sean, who 
     drags out Rennie. McCulloch follows close behind, helping 
     Sean carry her away from the wreckage, over by a row of 
     old oil drums filled with slime and rainwater. Then it 
     suddenly hits Sean...

                    SEAN
          Miss Van Deusen...

     He takes two steps back to the car when:

     BOOM! (EFX)     

     The squad car interior is ENGULFED IN A BALL OF FLAMES.

     RENNIE

     opens her dazed eyes, seeing Miss Van Deusen's body 
     charring inside the wreckage. It's incomprehensible. She 
     numbly gets to her feet, stepping towards it. Something 
     makes her hesitate: she peers down at the asphalt...

     EXT. ASPHALT - RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (POST EFX)

     A pool of gasoline has collected, flames dancing across 
     its glassy surface. Suddenly a TINY ROWBOAT DISSOLVES IN, 
     not unlike the lifeboat she was so afraid of. The 
     rowboat glides across the surface of the burning 
     gasoline, TWO PEOPLE RIDING IN IT. The flames and asphalt 
     SLOWLY FADE OUT AND GIVE WAY TO A SERENE LAKE.

     RENNIE'S FLASHBACK - CRYSTAL LAKE - DAY

     Shimmering water, clouds and pine trees reflected in it. 
     The rowboat floats into view. The two occupants are YOUNG 
     RENNIE and MCCULLOCH. She's wearing a bathing suit and an 
     innocent smile. And not an inkling of fear about the 
     water. She stands, letting the sun soak into her.

                    YOUNG RENNIE
          What a beautiful day.

                    MCCULLOCH
          Perfect for a swim, isn't it?

     She frowns at him, looking away.

                    MCCULLOCH
          You've been coming out here every 
          summer for the last three years, young 
          lady, and you still haven't learned 
          how.

                    YOUNG RENNIE
          I'll take some lessons this time. I 
          promise.

     She bends over, splashing the water.

                    MCCULLOCH
          That's what you said last year. I 
          think the time for your first swimming 
          lesson has just come.

     The splashing stops.

                    MCCULLOCH
          You don't want to end up drowning like 
          that Voorhees boy, do you?

     She's instantly tense.

                    MCCULLOCH
          He never learned how either and he's 
          still at the bottom of this lake.

                    YOUNG RENNIE
          He is not.

                    MCCULLOCH
          Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull 
          down anybody who falls in and can't 
          swim.

                    YOUNG RENNIE
          You're telling a lie.

                    MCCULLOCH
          Am I? Let's find out.

     ...And quicker than she's able to react to it, MCCULLOCH 
     PUSHES HER OVERBOARD.

     SPLASH!

     as Rennie's body violently disrupts the calm surface. 
     She immediately begins to flounder. McCulloch calmly 
     leans over the edge.

                    MCCULLOCH
          Better swim before Jason drags you 
          down, Rennie. Come on, you can do 
          it...

     ...but Rennie thrashes in the water, struggling to keep 
     from sinking under the surface.

     RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW

     Her uncle's face blurs and clears as water splashes her 
     eyes.

                    YOUNG RENNIE
          I...I can't...

                    MCCULLOCH
          You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!

     RENNIE

     is too panicked to obey.

                    YOUNG RENNIE
          Hhhhelp...me....

     She coughs on some water then disappears...

     UNDERWATER (TANK)

     The world above her ceases to exist, murky lake water 
     taking over. Rennie looks-down, and to her horror...

     RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (TANK)

     Young Jason is grabbing her ankle and dragging her 
     down. The whole image BURSTS INTO FLAMES and we:

                                          DISSOLVE BACK TO:

     EXT. ASPHALT - NIGHT

     as the gasoline continues to burn, the rowboat gone. 
     ADJUST to find RENNIE'S FACE, the flames of the car 
     wreckage flickering over her glassy eyes. She looks up at 
     Miss Van Deusen's body one last time before:

     ANGLE - SQUAD CAR (EFX)

     The auto's fuel tank EXPLODES, SHRAPNEL FLYING 
     EVERYWHERE.

     EXT. ALLEY #4 - CONTINUOUS

     She looks up at her uncle with knowing eyes. Eyes that 
     tell him she's remembered everything.

                    RENNIE
          You pushed me...

                    MCCULLOCH
               (defensively)
          I was only trying to teach you. But I 
          pulled you out, Rennie. I saved your 
          life.

     Rennie just stares, incredulous.

                    SEAN
          You son of a bitch...

     She lets it build until she's ready to explode...then:

                    RENNIE
          He was down there!!!

     And Rennie runs off. McCulloch starts to follow but Sean 
     grabs him, shoving him down.

                    SEAN
          You keep away from her!

     Sean chases after Rennie. Camera methodically PANS BACK 
     TO MCCULLOCH, crumpled on the ground. A very bitter man. 
     He wipes his hands, getting ready to stand when THE 
     SHADOW FALLS OVER HIM. His skin fades to porcelain white.

                    MCCULLOCH
          You...are...NOT POSSIBLE.

     But possible, and actual, he is. A PAIR OF ROTTED ARMS 
     EXTEND DOWN, RIPPING HIM OUT OF FRAME.

     TRACKING WITH JASON

     as the walking corpse lifts a screaming McCulloch over 
     his head, carrying him over to one of the scum-filled OIL 
     DRUMS, SHOVING HIM HEAD-FIRST INTO IT. Jason grips 
     McCulloch's thrashing legs as bubbles rise to the surface 
     of the slime, a pathetic gurgling reverberating out the 
     drum. At last McCulloch's appendages go limp. Jason 
     releases him, moving on.

     EXT. ALLEY #5 - NIGHT

     as Sean runs into view, glancing around, spotting Rennie, 
     crouched against a crumbled brick wall. No tears...only 
     hate. Sean sits down next to her. After several 
     moments...

                    RENNIE
          I was at school when they told me. 
          'Rennie, we have some very bad news... 
          your parents have been killed in an 
          auto accident.'

     Sean gently takes her hand, sharing her internal agony.

                    RENNIE
          It seems like everybody I care about 
          ends up...

     She can't finish. PUSH IN as Sean kisses her on the 
     forehead, then makes her look into his eyes.

                    SEAN
          Not this time.

     He caresses her face; it develops into a tender kiss. 
     Finally she holds him back, letting it out. At the same 
     time:

     STALKING POINT OF VIEW

     Somebody is creeping at a low angle towards them.

     SEAN AND RENNIE

     are lost in their shared quiet moment...until the 
     GROWLING SOUND becomes audible. They look up, seeing:

     TOBY

     cautiously approaching them. Rennie stands, absolutely 
     relieved.

                    RENNIE
          Toby...

     She starts to move towards him and her dog SNARLS 
     VICIOUSLY, CROUCHING BACK IN FEAR.

                    RENNIE
          What's wrong, boy?

     Another protective growl, then:

     CRASH!

     as Jason stampedes through a stack of crates and garbage 
     cans behind them.

     SEAN, RENNIE AND TOBY

     abruptly flee down the alley, Jason in mad pursuit.     

     EXT. ALLEY/SUBWAY ENTRANCE - NIGHT

     as Rennie, Sean and the dog run straight towards us, 
     Jason swiftly catching up. FAST TRACK WITH THEM over to a 
     deserted, rain-slicked SUBWAY ENTRANCE.

     INT. SUBWAY ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS (EFX)

     as they bang through the glass doors, sailing past us. 
     Three beats later, JASON APPEARS, not bothering to open 
     the door, STAMPEDING RIGHT THROUGH THE GLASS.

     INT. SUBWAY STATION - ESCALATORS (N.Y.)

     Sean, Rennie and Toby sail down the escalators past a few 
     scattered COMMUTERS. Again, Jason appears, looming tall 
     at the top. He starts down the "up" escalator.

     JASON'S POINT OF VIEW (ICY.)

     as an ELDERLY COUPLE rises toward us. Their reactions 
     grow more bleak the closer we get, finally registering 
     terror as we plow right through them.

     ANGLE - SUBWAY TURNSTILES (ICY.)

     Sean and Rennie hop over a metal turnstile, Toby crawling 
     under it. A TICKET TAKER leans out his window, shouting 
     at them.

                    TICKET TAKER
          Hey!

     The teenagers are soon forgotten as JASON SMASHES THROUGH 
     THE TURNSTILE LIKE THE TERMINATOR, TEARING THE ALUMINUM 
     WHEEL RIGHT OFF ITS BASE. The Ticket Taker reacts 
     speechlessly, deciding not to press his luck.

     INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS (N.Y.)

     as Sean and Rennie slide up to the edge of the track pit, 
     SEEING THE LIGHTS OF AN APPROACHING TRAIN which is taking 
     too long to get there.

                    SEAN
          Come on...

     ...but Jason arrives before the train. Toby barks and 
     snarls, trying to protect them. Jason is unfazed. He 
     treads toward them and:

     DOG TOBY

     leaps onto Jason, sinking his teeth into the monster's 
     throat. Jason wrestles the animal into submission just 
     as:

     THE SUBWAY TRAIN

     streaks into the station. A fraction of time later:

     JASON

     heaves the dog in front of the train.

     RENNIE

     shrieks in horror as Toby disappears inside the pit just 
     as the train roars by.

     ANGLE - ONLOOKERS

     They're New Yorkers, but not callous enough to stomach 
     this, quickly scattering. Even a group of severe 
     SKINHEADS decide they can wait for the next train, 
     quickly heading up the escalators after seeing Jason in 
     action.

     SEAN

     makes Rennie look away, dragging her with him along the 
     platform edge in retreat as Jason returns his attention 
     to them. They reach the end of the platform, having no 
     choice but to board the front car.

     INT. SUBWAY TRAIN (N.Y.)

     as the doors whoosh shut...but Jason PRIES THEM OPEN. The 
     TRAIN ENGINEER glances back from his booth, seeing Jason 
     making the improper entry.

                    TRAIN ENGINEER
          Hey pal, you can't do that...

     A second later he's gotten a good look at Jason. It's too 
     late for a retraction as JASON SAVAGELY JAMS HIS HEAD 
     INTO THE TRAIN CONSOLE.

     INSERT - TRAIN CONSOLE

     as the Engineer's arm KNOCKS THE THROTTLE FORWARD...

     EXT. SUBWAY STATION - CONTINUOUS (N.Y.)

     ...and the train begins to move, racing into the black 
     tunnel.

     INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT (N.Y.)

     as Rennie and Sean run for their lives, arriving at the 
     end of a car, jamming the separating doors open and 
     entering the next car. Jason follows right behind.

     INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT (N.Y.)

     as the train thunders through the station without 
     stopping, baffling several waiting COMMUTERS.

     INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - JASON'S POINT OF VIEW (N.Y.)

     --seeing Sean and Rennie disappear through another 
     connecting door. We storm our way through it into the 
     next car right after them. A handful of TRAVELERS cower 
     away from us.

     INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT (N.Y.)

     as the train rapidly speeds past us, showing no signs of 
     slowing down.

     INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - FINAL CAR (N.Y.)

     as Sean and Rennie come through another set of separating 
     doors, rushing through... finding they're in the last 
     car. They look back, seeing Jason enter at the opposite 
     end. The monster stalks forward. Sean's eyes dart 
     around. He spots the EMERGENCY STOP CORD. HE LEAPS FOR 
     IT.

     EXT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT (N.Y.)

     ...and the train SCREECHES TO A HALT.

     INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - CONTINUOUS (N.Y.)

     The sudden stop throws Jason on his back. Sean throws the 
     rear door open, jumping out with Rennie.

     INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT (N.Y.)

     as Sean and Rennie sprint down the center of the tracks 
     toward the light of the next station, running out of 
     strength.

     INT. TIMES SQUARE STATION - NIGHT (N.Y.)

     as they emerge from the darkness, up to the edge of the 
     pit. Sean boosts Rennie up, starting to climb up himself 
     when:

     JASON

     fires out from the tunnel, grabbing onto Sean's ankle. 
     Rennie screams as Sean is dragged down...but he manages 
     to latch onto a chain securing a garbage receptacle. 
     Jason pulls harder, stretching Sean to his limit as 
     Rennie watches helplessly.

                    RENNIE
          NO!!!

     RENNIE

     runs straight towards the track pit like a football 
     punter, RECOILING WITH HER RIGHT LEG, KICKING JASON 
     SQUARELY IN THE FACE.

     JASON (EFX)

     trips backwards and LANDS ON THE THIRD, ELECTRIFIED RAIL, 
     RECEIVING TEN THOUSAND VOLTS. His body smokes and 
     convulses, finally sizzling out. He appears to be 
     terminated!!!

     ANGLE - SEAN AND RENNIE

     as they get to their feet, holding each other tight, 
     looking down on the now-dead undead creature.

     EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT (N.Y.) (CRANE SHOT)

     as our heroes arise into the neon-filled big city 
     wonderland, relieved to be alive, gazing around at the 
     awesome spectacle known as Times Square. A huge DIGITAL 
     CLOCK tells us it's a quarter to midnight. Sean wraps his 
     arm around her.

                    SEAN
          It's over, Rennie. It's finally over.

     Camera RISES ABOVE THEM, RACKING BACK TO THE SUBWAY EXIT. 
     Guess who has just made an encore...with more energy 
     than ever!!!

     SEAN AND RENNIE

     look all around them, having never been to a city as big 
     as this. They finally turn far enough around to spot 
     JASON in a series of three quick cuts, each one closer 
     than the last.

                    SEAN
          God...please no...

     But Jason keeps on coming.

                    RENNIE
          Somebody help us!! He's going to kill 
          us!!!

     But the heavy Times Square foot traffic ignores her, 
     bustling onward. Rennie and Sean have no choice but to 
     flee again.

     JASON

     shoves his way through the preoccupied pedestrians; 
     they've certainly seen weirder characters than him here. 
     He moves past a group of STREET URCHINS listening to some 
     rap from their ghetto blaster. His foot obliterates 
     their stereo system with one stride. They instantly pull 
     out switchblades and chains.

                    STREET URCHIN
          You're dead meat, slime bag.

     Jason stops, turning around, towering over the kids. He 
     has blood and gore caked everywhere, his skin charred 
     from the electrocution. Jason starts to remove his mask, 
     facing them squarely.

     TIGHT ON STREET URCHINS

     as Jason's mask comes off out-of-frame. Their tough faces 
     turn to putty, scared completely shitless.

                    STREET URCHIN
          Hey man, it's cool, it's cool...

     They turn tail and race like the wind. Jason steps 
     forward so that we're looking at the back of his head, 
     never seeing his naked face. He slips his hockey mask on 
     again, turns into a CLOSE UP, then exits.

     INT. TIMES SQUARE DINER - NIGHT

     filled with noise, smoke and derelicts. A tough, 
     redheaded WAITRESS with a thick Brooklyn accent stands 
     behind the countertop, a wall of mirrors behind her. The 
     front door bangs open with the entrance of Sean and 
     Rennie, rushing up to the waitress.

                    SEAN
               (out of breath)
          You have to call the police...

                    RENNIE
          Please, hurry...

     A telephone sits right next to her, but this is New York.

                    WAITRESS
          There's a pay phone in back.

     They start to run.

                    WAITRESS
          ...but it's broken.

                    RENNIE
          You don't understand -- there's a 
          maniac trying to kill us!!!

                    WAITRESS
               (blase)
          Welcome to New York.

     There's no time for further response as JASON CRASHES 
     THROUGH THE DINER DOOR, MOWING A PATH STRAIGHT TOWARDS 
     THEM. Sean and Rennie run out the back as the Waitress 
     eyes Jason with complete disbelief.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     as the BURLY CHEF comes out to confront him. Jason FLINGS 
     HIM HEAD FIRST INTO THE JUKEBOX.

     THE WAITRESS

     picks up the telephone, really pissed off.

     A BIKER

     climbs off his counter stool, revealing a HUGE BOWIE 
     KNIFE. Jason plows straight for him and the Biker STABS 
     JASON IN THE HEART. Jason has little reaction, pulling it 
     out, tossing it aside. The Biker's face goes wan, backing 
     away.

     THE WAITRESS

     stops in mid-dial. Fear is starting to register now.

     JASON

     lifts the very large man and EFFORTLESSLY HEAVES HIM INTO 
     THE MIRROR OVER THE COUNTER.

     THE WAITRESS

     feels the phone receiver slipping from her grasp, her 
     mouth trembling. She backs away from the beast as far as 
     she can. Jason has no time to waste on her, trampling out 
     the back after Rennie and Sean as the other patrons 
     shrink from him.

     INT. REAR OF DINER - SAME TIME

     as Sean fumbles to unlock three deadbolts and two chains, 
     finally getting the back door open and springing into:

     EXT. DEAD END ALLEY - NIGHT

     They run about ten yards before realizing the alley is a 
     dead end. Sean and Rennie start to head back the other 
     way when JASON MOWS OUT FROM THE DINER DOOR. Their vision 
     scatters everywhere in search of a retreat...

                    RENNIE
          Look!

     She's spotted a MANHOLE COVER, slightly ajar. They 
     haven't the luxury of thinking about it, Sean sliding the 
     cover back as Jason comes forth.

     INT. SEWER - ENTRANCE CHAMBER - NIGHT

     as they descend into hell...a massive chamber consisting 
     of tall columns, slimy catacombs and three feet of 
     stagnant water. Their alternatives are nil; Sean and 
     Rennie join hands, wading through the swill, splashing 
     deeper into the labyrinth.

     ANGLE UP STAIRS

     as the dim streetlight glowing in the above world is 
     eclipsed by JASON, making his way down after them.

     INT. TUNNEL #1 - NIGHT

     An oval tunnel slanted downward into pitch blackness. 
     Dim overhead lights illuminate salt deposits and eery 
     rust formations. Rennie and Sean appear at the far end, 
     wading from the sewage as the tunnel rises toward us.

     TRACKING SHOT

     as they come forward at a brisk but cautious pace, 
     strangers in a very strange land.

     ANGLE - THEIR FEET

     sloshing through the slime. All is silent until Sean's 
     foot TRIPS OVER A BARREL labeled HUGHES CHEMICAL PLANT. 
     A vaporous green substance oozes out the rusty end of 
     the container, sizzling on the around.

     SEAN AND RENNIE

     carefully sidestep it, continuing on. They make it 
     another ten yards when A FIGURE LEAPS OUT FROM AN ALCOVE, 
     GRIPPING A HUGE WRENCH. Rennie's scream echoes through 
     the tunnel.

     REVERSE ANGLE

     ...but it's a middle-aged SANITATION ENGINEER who lowers 
     the wrench, as frightened as they are.

                    SANITATION ENGINEER
          What the hell are you kids doing down 
          here?

                    SEAN
          Can you help us get out??

                    SANITATION ENGINEER
          I sure can and we don't have a minute 
          to waste.

     He begins quickly packing up his tools.

                    SEAN
          What do you mean?

                    SANITATION ENGINEER
          Toxic waste, son. This sewer floods 
          out with the stuff on the 13th of 
          every month, right at midnight.
               (checks watch)
          And that's less than ten minutes from 
          now.

     Rennie looks down the dark tunnels in all directions, 
     swallowing hard.

                    SANITATION ENGINEER
          Follow me.

     He clicks on his high powered flashlight and quickly 
     leads them down:

     INT. TUNNEL #2

     ...no less threatening than the one they just left. When 
     they pass a lightless intersecting corridor, JASON EJECTS 
     HIMSELF FROM IT, TACKLING THE SANITATION ENGINEER AND 
     SEAN.

     THE FLASHLIGHT

     rolls through the muck, its beam splashing erratically 
     across the polluted walls.

     THE SANITATION ENGINEER

     begins BASHING JASON'S HEAD IN WITH HIS WRENCH but the 
     monster drags the kicking and screaming man into TUNNEL 
     #3.

     RENNIE

     tries to help up Sean but he's been knocked into the 
     opposite wall, barely conscious.

                    SEAN
          Run, Rennie...

     She's struck with indecisive shock, looking into Tunnel 
     #3, seeing:

     A GRUESOME SHADOW ON THE WALL

     Jason arches his back with wrench in hand, hammering it 
     over and over into the Sanitation Engineer's skull.

     RENNIE

     backs away but does not run. The time has come to face 
     her fears.

     ANGLE - SHADOW ON TUNNEL #3 WALL

     as Jason takes one more vengeful stroke, finishing him 
     off. He steps from Tunnel #3 with the scarlet-coated 
     tool, his shadow becoming flesh. He moves straight for 
     Sean, who has no hope for escape. Jason cocks the wrench 
     over Sean's skull...and suddenly his hockey mask is 
     SPLASHED WITH A BRIGHT LIGHT. Jason stops, turning 
     directly into it.

     JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

     Rennie is blinding us with the sanitation Engineer's 
     flashlight, giving us only brief glimpses of herself in 
     the reflective wet surroundings.

                    RENNIE
          You never got me in the lake, Jason. 
          And you're not going to get me now 
          either.

     Her voice is defiant. She carefully backstops, the 
     irritating light never leaving us.

     JASON

     has been sufficiently taunted. He moves after her.

     JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

     as the bright beam leaves our eyes, Rennie dashing down 
     the intersecting tunnel (#1).

     TIGHT ON JASON'S FEET

     stomping through the sludge, picking up speed. He's 
     wanted to kill Rennie most of all.

     INT. TUNNEL #L

     as Rennie dashes up to the HUGHES CHEMICAL DRUM Sean 
     tripped over, using the back end of the flashlight to 
     crush in the can's rusted lid. The metal is flimsy but 
     still resists her blows. She frantically hammers harder.

     INT. TUNNEL #2 - TRACKING WITH JASON

     He's moving like a freight train now, an addict rolling 
     after his fix.

     INSERT - CHEMICAL DRUM

     as the butt of the flashlight dents the metal, ultimately 
     causing it to cave in.

     INT. TUNNEL INTERSECTION - JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

     --Looking through his unblinking eyes, whipping into 
     Tunnel #1...where we catch a fleeting glimpse of Rennie 
     flinging the contents of the oil drum. A half second 
     later a WAVE OF GRAY/GREEN LIQUID FLIES AT US...

     TIGHT ON JASON (SLOW MOTION)

     and his hockey mask is SPLASHED WITH TOXIC WASTE, 
     SEEPING INTO HIS MASK'S EYE SLITS. He careens back as if 
     her were a rabid dog receiving a load of point-blank 
     buckshot.

     RENNIE

     drops the can, fumbling for the flashlight again.

     CLOSE UP - JASON (EFX)

     as the radiant flashlight beam finds his mask, the 
     plastic beginning to bubble and melt. RUSH INTO A TIGHT 
     CLOSE UP AS JASON TEARS OFF HIS MASK, EXPOSING HIS 
     HIDEOUS FACE: rotted flesh, some of it sizzling from the 
     chemical. Worms slithering out his nostrils. And his 
     eyes...or lack thereof. They're like two raw quail eggs 
     frying in liquid green pollutant...and the yolks just 
     broke, running down his face.

     CLOSE ON FLASHLIGHT

     as the beam begins to waver in her quivering grasp. RISE 
     TO FIND RENNIE'S FACE, reacting to the stomach-turning 
     sight of Jason's visage. She grabs hold of her senses and 
     RUNS.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     as Rennie skirts past the blinded creature: WHIP PAN WITH 
     HER as she turns down Tunnel #2, heading back toward 
     Sean. CONTINUE TO QUICKLY PAN AROUND until we've come 
     around 360 degrees and are back on JASON, in no way 
     ready to give up. He staggers after Rennie.

     INT. TUNNEL #2

     as Rennie skids up to Sean, still dazed. She grabs him, 
     shaking hard.

                    RENNIE
          Get up, Sean!!!

     His eyes blink, only half coherent. Then an inconceivable 
     terror registers in her ears...A LOW, DEEP RUMBLING 
     SOUND, COMING FROM UP AHEAD. Her head jerks in the 
     direction of her planned retreat:

     RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW

     An ominously empty tunnel, soon to be filled with the 
     unthinkable. The sound of RUSHING LIQUID is growing at 
     leaps and bounds.

     TIGHT ON RENNIE

     as her trembling chin rises, looking at:

     ANGLE - TUNNEL #3 CEILING (EFX)

     The dim overhead lights are beginning to vibrate from 
     the approaching flood.

     RENNIE

     rotates her head and sees:

     JASON

     vision or no vision, he is lurching towards her 
     relentlessly. She is literally sandwiched between hell 
     and high water.

     RENNIE

     drags Sean to his feet with the strength of a possessed 
     woman, pulling him over to a SERVICE LADDER attached to 
     the intersecting alcove wall.

                    RENNIE
               (screaming)
          Climb!!!

     She shoves him up it from below, Sean summoning 
     everything he's got to obey her. Rennie shoots a stare 
     back down the tunnel...

     RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (EFX)

     The overhead lights are banging around like an earthquake 
     has just hit; the liquid will be arriving any second. Her 
     vision WHIP PANS 180 DEGREES TO FIND JASON APPROACHING 
     FROM THE OPPOSITE END, groping around with his scaly arms 
     like the claws of a roto-tiller.

     ANGLE - LADDER

     as Rennie starts up after Sean, looking down and seeing:

     JASON

     within ten feet of them, shifting directly for the ladder 
     like he's working on some kind of radar.

     RENNIE

     slips on the rusty ladder, regaining her footing. and 
     rushing higher. She takes her final glance into the 
     tunnel, the ultimate horror registering in her corneas as 
     she sees:

     INT. TUNNEL #3 (MODEL EFX)

     A million gallons of green-brown toxic waste splash into 
     the far intersection, FILLING THE TUNNEL, FLOODING 
     STRAIGHT FOR CAMERA.

     JASON

     has just started to climb the ladder when the wind and 
     smell of the rushing toxic waste bombards him. His 
     decomposed head swivels to face:

     INT. TUNNEL #3 (MODEL EFX)

     Tons of lethal sewage, stopping for no one. Arriving in 
     seconds.

     JASON'S FINAL CLOSE UP (EFX/FIBER OPTIC LENS)

     He doesn't need vision to confirm what his other senses 
     already know. Jason's mouth begins to quaver...AND THE 
     FIRST WORDS HE HAS EVER SPOKEN COME OUT, IN THE VOICE OF 
     AN EIGHT YEAR OLD BOY:

                    JASON
          Mmmmmmmmmommy...DON'T LET ME DROWN, 
          MOMMY...

     Camera speeds toward his gaping mouth and DOWN HIS THROAT 
     as lightning arcs off his mucous covered insides. We 
     sink deeper into his guts, fire and smoke flaring into 
     our eves, eventually coming to a WELL IN THE PIT OF HIS 
     STOMACH, FILLED WITH BLOOD...and EIGHT YEAR OLD JASON IS 
     DROWNING IN IT.

                    YOUNG JASON
          Hhhhelp me....

     A split second later:

     EXT. TUNNEL #3 (EFX) (SLOW MOTION)

     The wall of deadly toxic liquid ENGULFS JASON.

     INT. TUNNEL #3 - ON RENNIE AND SEAN (EFX)

     The powerful flood thrashes the ladder about two inches 
     below Rennie's feet, the force of it fiercely shaking 
     their rusty support. They are clinging to the ladder with 
     their eyes squeezed shut. Praying for survival.

     INT. TUNNEL #3 (MODEL EFX)

     We are drowning in a chunky cloud of sewage, rushing over 
     and under us.

     EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT (EFX)

     The digital clock we saw earlier abruptly CHIMES 
     MIDNIGHT, HUGE BOLTS OF LIGHTNING CRACKING OVER 
     MANHATTAN.

     ANGLE - SEAN AND RENNIE (EFX)

     as the sewage level begins to drop. Rennie opens her 
     eyes, glancing straight down and seeing.

     RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (EFX)

     The ladder beneath them reappears...which gives way to a 
     PAIR OF HANDS GRIPPING THE BOTTOM RUNG. The liquid drops 
     further, unshrouding the now-dead corpse of EIGHT YEAR 
     OLD JASON. He's a relatively normal looking boy, 
     probably the way he looked back in 1957...right when he 
     drowned in Crystal Lake.

     Jason Voorhees has finally been put to rest.

     EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT (N.Y.)

     Rennie and Sean stagger out from a side street, holding 
     each other up...relief etched in their matured faces.

                    SEAN
          I hear there's a statue here that's 22 
          stories tall.

     Rennie would smile if she could. She kisses his cheek. 
     They amble on.

     STALKING POINT OF VIEW

     ...coming out from another alley, creeping up behind them 
     through a crowd of pedestrians. About the height of a 
     small child.

     RENNIE AND SEAN

     walk arm in arm, exhausted and oblivious to their 
     pursuer. But something, some innate perception causes 
     Rennie to slow...and stop. Her eyes register a horrid 
     fear and she WHIPS AROUND TO FACE...

     TOBY!

     Limping on all fours, filthy with grease-matted fur. The 
     whimpering dog crawls up to her, Rennie bending down, 
     hugging her animal like she'll never let go.

                    RENNIE
          Oh Toby...

     HIGH ANGLE CRANE SHOT (N.Y.)

     as Sean bends down too, ruffling the dog's fur, standing 
     again with Rennie. The three survivors enter the collage 
     of pedestrians, bright lights and skyscrapers. 

     It is finally over.

                                        FADE OUT.

                         THE END
