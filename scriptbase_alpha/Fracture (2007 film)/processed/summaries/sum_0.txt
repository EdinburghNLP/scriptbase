Wealthy, brilliant, and meticulous Ted Crawford, a structural engineer in Los Angeles, shoots his wife and entraps her lover.
He signs a confession; at the arraignment, he asserts his rights to represent himself and asks the court to move immediately to trial.
The prosecutor is Willy Beachum, a hotshot who's soon to join a fancy civil-law firm, told by everyone it's an open and shut case.
Crawford sees Beachum's weakness, the hairline fracture of his character: Willy's a winner.
The engineer sets in motion a clockwork crime with all the objects moving in ways he predicts.
