EXT. OCEAN - DAY

We're flying under the wing of a submarine attack plane, circa
1940.  Below us lies an infinite ocean.  CREDITS PLAY over this
unrelenting waterscape until we spy...

A sequin of light.


INT. ATTACK PLANE - DAY

The PROP ROAR is deafening.  A Navy LOOK-OUT mimes to his PILOT,
<i>"Go down, go down."</i>


EXT. OCEAN - DAY

Circling, we descend on the water.  Soon "whitecaps" resolve into
scattered wreckage.  One scrap winks at us again.  It's a small
boat.


EXT. LIFEBOAT - OCEAN - DAY

An empty tin is being rocked back and forth, its bottom catching
sunlight.  We're so CLOSE that we can't see who does the
signaling.


INT. ATTACK PLANE - DAY

The look-out pencils "HELP IS COMING."

The note goes inside a coffee thermos.

The thermos goes out the window.


EXT. ATTACK PLANE - DAY

As the attack plane peels away.


INT. MANTA - DECRYPTING MONTAGE

CONTINUE CREDITS.  A radio message is being decrypted.  We see
CLOSEUPS of cipher wheels being turned on E.C.M. gear...new
letters appearing...each letter dutifully retyped on a jagged
typewriter.  A double "X" ends the message.

EXT. MANTA BRIDGE - PRE-DAWN

                        SURVIVORS SPOTTED X

                  LEND ALL POSSIBLE ASSISTANCE XX

Finished reading, Lt. RICHARD BRICE passes the message on to Lt.
PAUL LOOMIS.  If this were today, we might intro these two 30-
year-olds playing beach volleyball or working the Nasdaq exchange.
But it's not today, it's 60 years ago, so instead we find them
conning 310 feet of Balao-class submarine (the V.S.S. Manta),
riding surface across an inky ocean, just trying to get home to
Connecticut.

                         LOOMIS
          Almost a day behind us.

No outward reaction from Brice.

                         LOOMIS
          Well, who are they?  Americans?  Brits?
          'Talians?  Doesn't even say.

                         BRICE
          I think we can assume they're friendly,
          Mr. Loomis.
                    (off his look)
          Besides, it doesn't appear to be a
          suggestion, does it?

                         LOOMIS
                    (warming to the
                     inevitable)
          Hell, why not?  Might get a silver star
          out of this patrol yet.

                         BRICE
          Have Coors plot it out.

Loomis grinds out a smoke and starts below.  Brice lifts
binoculars to scan the horizon ahead.


EXT. MANTA BRIDGE - DAY

BINOX POV:  Abruptly it's daytime.  In our sights now is a red-
sailed boat, adrift.  We're still too far away to see faces, but
arms are waving madly at us.

                         BRICE (O.S.)
          Not very many....

A rescue detail is assembling on the foredeck of the sub.  Two
BLUESHIRTS man the look-out posts up in the periscope sheers.
Joining Brice topside is Ensign DOUGLAS ODELL, 23, Brigham Young,
smart but green.

                         ODELL
                    (reminding)
          Gunner's mates standing by below, sir.

                         BRICE
          Stow the weapons.  They're British.

                         ODELL
          You can tell that?  From here?

                         BRICE
          The sail -- Krauts use white on their
          lifeboats, Brits red.  Don't they teach
          that in O.C.S., ensign?

                         ODELL
          'Fraid not, sir.  Though I can recite the
          submariner's motto in Latin.

Brice gives him a look.  <i>"Handy."</i>


INT. CONTROL ROOM

                         RADAR MAN
          Mr. Coors?

Lt. STEVEN COORS, 26, leans over the RADAR MAN'S shoulder to
check...

The cathode screen.  A blip is materializing.


EXT. MANTA BRIDGE - DAY

                         COORS (O.S./INTERCOM)
          Radar contact, sir, starboard beam, 11
          miles out....

As one, all binoculars whip starboard.

BINOX POV:  We can't spot the warship that's out there yet -- the
horizon is hazed in -- but we do see a plume of black smoke above
the haze.  Ominous.

                         ODELL
          Think they see us?

                         BRICE
          [They're] pourin' on the coal for
          somebody.

He does the mental math:  The warship's likely approach-speed on
the Manta...the Manta's approach-speed on the lifeboat...the time
needed by the rescue party....

                           BRICE
                    (into intercom)
          All ahead emergency.  Rudder amidships.
          Crew to battle stations.
                    (shouting to
                     foredeck)
          Awright, let's do this at flank speed!
          You grab what's breathing on that boat and
          leave anything else behind!  Got it?
                    (down the hatch)
          Stand by to board passengers!

BINOX POV:  Of the warship's smoke.  Growing denser.


INT. CONNING TOWER - DAY

The first of three survivors appears:  SCHILLINGS is lowered
through the bridge hatch via an improvised rope-sling.  He's
burned, slick with oil, unconscious.  Moving fast, Loomis and a
few blue shirts guide him down.

                         LOOMIS
          Well done, well done.  Just lay him aside
          and keep 'em comin', keep 'em comin'....

Next appears KINGSLEY, 40, wearing the tatters of a British
merchant marine uniform.  One leg is splintered with a broken oar.

                         KINGSLEY
          Easy on the leg, lads...already in enough
          pieces....

                         LOOMIS
          Talk later, move now.  Next ladder, next
          ladder....

Kingsley is helped below.  Reaching for the third survivor, the
men suddenly find themselves in the company of...

CLAIRE PAIGE, 30.  She's lovely in a salt-caked, sun-beaten,
water-starved sort of way.

                         LOOMIS
          Well done.


INT. MANTA - SERIES OF ROOMS

CAMERA FOLLOWS a series of men as the message is passed through
the boat in bucket-brigade fashion:

                         SERIES OF MEN
          "Three survivors...Brits...one's a woman."
          Pass it on.

The message travels back, past the radio shack...

...through the galley and mess room...

...through the crew quarters...

...through the engine room...

...through the maneuvering room...


INT. AFT TORPEDO ROOM

...and finally dead-ends here.

                         HOAG
          "Three tea bags."  And get this -- one's a
          bleeder.

                         STUMBO
          Aw, Sweet Baby Jesus....

                         PAPPY
          Well, if it means you guys finally wash
          the butt-squirt outta your shorts, I'm all
          for it.

PAPPY is the ancient mariner of the boat -- he's 43.  STUMBO and
HOAG are torpedo mates and world-class misogynists.  We've seen
most of the blue shirts now, and they're a cranky, pasty-faced,
unshaven lot on the 50th day of patrol.

                         STUMBO
          That's all this boat needs -- one more
          piece of rotten luck.


INT. CONNING TOWER

Dropping inside from the bridge above:

                         BRICE
          Let's pull the plug.

                         LOOMIS
          Clear the bridge, rig for dive.

He jerks the alarm box:  AHOOGA-AHOOGA.

                         BRICE
          Periscope depth.

                         LOOMIS
          Cycle the vents, blow negative, take us
          down to 65 feet.


INT. MANTA - DIVING MONTAGE

In FAST SHOTS we see:

The bridge hatch is slammed shut and dogged down.

In the control room, the "Christmas tree" board switches to solid
green.  All hatches are now air-tight.

                         CHIEF
          Pressure in the boat.

Ballast controls are thrown.

Maneuvering room:  Telegraphs ratchet up "STANDARD SPEED" and
"FULL DIVE."  Pappy and his men yank levers in response.

Control room:  PLANESMAN #1 swings a handle and...


EXT. MANTA - DAY

The bow planes deploy, catching water.


EXT. MANTA - ABOVE AND BELOW WATER - DAY

We dive.  The ocean rushes over us and swallows us whole.  Moments
later we're burrowing through a world of perpetual twilight.  And
no matter how long we're down here, we'll never really get used to
it.


INT. CONTROL ROOM

(NOTE:  There are no DAY/NIGHT designations for our interiors as
they have no meaning aboard a submarine.  Besides, every scene
should <u>feel</u> like night -- with pooling lights, noir shadows,
corpselike bodies sleeping in bunks.)

                         SONAR #1 (O.S.)
          Contact bearing 1-5-0....

CONNING TOWER VOICES filter down on the three survivors, sprawled
on the control room floor.  A STEWARD offers sips of water.  Odell
checks the unconscious Schillings.

                         CLAIRE
          He's in and out.  I didn't try to dress
          the wounds until they'd been cleaned.
          Have any sulphating agents?

                         ODELL
                    (rummaging
                     through medical
                     pouch)
          Morphine...penicillin...ether...this looks
          like, uh....

                         CLAIRE
          You're aren't the doctor, are you?

                         ODELL
          Pharmacist Mate is best you get on a
          submarine...

Claire nods.  <i>"I understand."</i>

                         ODELL
          ...but he missed the boat.  I'm Odell,
          supply officer.  They gave me the job 'cuz
          I have keys to this stuff.  Here....

He helps get her life jacket off.  Stenciling reads "Fort James."

                         ODELL
          What happened to your ship?

From the tower above:

                         BRICE
          We'll debrief later, Mr. Odell.  Just find
          them quarters.


INT. CONNING TOWER

PERISCOPE POV:  A water-lapping view of a German warship.  It's
out of the haze now.  And angling our way.

                         BRICE (O.S.)
          Two-stacker.  'Bout 9,000 tons.  Possible
          Rhine class.

Brice watches on the attack periscope.  Loomis flips through a
ship-identification manual, finds a match.

                         LOOMIS
          If it is...rear racks, no side throwers,
          twin six-inch guns, grapple­hooks...good
          to 200 feet.

SONAR #1 looks over his shoulder at Brice, wondering how long he's
going to think things over.

                         SONAR #1
          Fast screws, Mr. Brice.  30 knots or
          better.

                         BRICE
                    (deciding)
          250 feet, right full rudder.

For whatever reason, Brice is ducking the fight -- and most here
seem fine with that.  Loomis resets the alarm-box.

                         LOOMIS
          Secure from battle stations.


INT. STATEROOM

Bone-tired, Kingsley drops into one bunk while...


INT. CLAIRE'S STATEROOM/FORWARD CORRIDOR

Odell and the steward ease Schillings into another.

Odell rejoins Claire in the corridor.  She's taking stock of the
forward section, everything disturbingly tight here.

                         ODELL
          So this "Fort James"....

                         CLAIRE
          Hospital ship.  We were attacked two
          nights ago.  Two nights?  Sorry, brain's a
          bit foggy -- though I'm reasonably sure
          I'm Claire Paige.  Should be able to fill
          in the details as soon as --

A MOURNFUL WAIL interrupts her.  It seems to come from <u>outside</u> the
hull.

                         ODELL
          Just a whale.

                         CLAIRE
          How far down are we?

                         ODELL
          200 feet or so, on our way to 250.
                    (off her ashen
                     look)
          Still gets to me, too -- the sounds down
          here.

                         CLAIRE
          No, no, it's just that...I have a small
          problem with...confined areas.

Lugging shoring beams, Stumbo and Hoag appear.

                         STUMBO
          Comin' through...watch your toes...make
          way for the workin' men....

Claire shies back as they plow through, aware of their
disapproving looks.  The steward steps back into the corridor.

                         STEWARD
                    (re Schillings)
          Doesn't look good.

                         ODELL
          See if you can't cut those clothes off.
          Get a better look at his wounds.

                         CLAIRE
          I can change the dressings.  Other than
          that, I think it's best to just let him
          be.

                         ODELL
          Officers' shower just forward.  We try to
          hold it down to 30 seconds, but [in your
          case]....

                         CLAIRE
          Do we know if there were others?  Anyone
          else rescued?

                         ODELL
          Not that I heard of, ma'am.  Sorry.

It weighs on her.

                         CLAIRE
          Thank you.  Thank you ever so much.


INT. CONTROL ROOM

                         COORS
          ...but with these currents, let's consider
          this heading plus-or-minus one degree
          until our next star-fix.

At the chart table, Brice and Loomis review Coors' calcs.

                         BRICE
          Well done.  If we make 15 knots by night,
          we can be back in the barn in 96 hours.

                         LOOMIS
          [So we're] taking the Brits back too?

                         BRICE
          Mr. Coors, you have the conn.
                    (to Loomis)
          Let's get their story.


INT. OFFICERS' WARDROOM

Brice and Loomis are debriefing Kingsley, who sits on the table
having his leg re-splinted by Odell as...

                         KINGSLEY
          Sorry, maybe I didn't make myself clear.
          I <u>saw</u> it.  Crossed the moon's reflection
          just before the explosion.  Wasn't a mine
          -- it was a U-boat.

Brice and Loomis swap looks.  <i>"A U-boat.  Wonderful."</i>

                         LOOMIS
          What class?  Type 7?  Older boat?

Loomis produces an "AXIS IDENTIFICATION MANUAL," plops it down in
Kingsley's lap and starts flipping pages, showing him silhouettes
of various German submarines.

                         LOOMIS
          Or one of their newer ones?  Clean at the
          bow?  No net-cutter?

                         KINGSLEY
          It was just a second or two.  Sorry, know
          it would be helpful, but....

                         BRICE
          So you were on look-out that night,
          Mister....

                         KINGSLEY
          Kingsley, sub-lieutenant, merchant marine.
          Hello.  Grabbing a gasper, actually,
          starboard deck.  A "smoke."

                         BRICE
          And how many aboard your ship?

                         CLAIRE (O.S.)
          300 patients.

Claire appears, newly showered.  The men can't help notice how
well she cleans up.

                         CLAIRE
          At least that many.  Out of North Africa.

                         KINGSLEY
          And probably 70 hands in the crew, so....

Brice nods grimly.  <i>"400 lives."</i>  We hear more WHALE CRIES,
forlorn and disturbing.

                         ODELL
                    (to Kingsley)
          You said they fired one torpedo?

                         BRICE
          Odell, better tell sonar we've got an
          enemy sub in the area.

                         ODELL
                    (trying to finish
                     splint)
          Just give me one....

                         BRICE
          Do it now.

Odell leaves.  Claire takes his place -- and proceeds to rework
the splint.

                         BRICE
          I'm just sorry we couldn't save more.  And
          the third in your party?  He's....

                         CLAIRE
          One of the patients.  Though I couldn't
          tell you his name just now.

Kingsley flinches.  Did Claire hurt him?  Or did he flinch at her
answer?

                         BRICE
          So under normal conditions, I'd drop you
          at the nearest port in England, but that's
          a 300-mile detour for us, and we're over-
          extended as it is.  Sorry, but seems we're
          stuck with each other.

                         CLAIRE
          Can we get a radio message off?  Let
          people know we're still --

                         BRICE
          We only radio when we're on the surface,
          Miss Paige, and we only surface at night
          -- if we can help it.
                    (starting to
                     leave)
          Oh, and last thing.  Try not to
          fraternize.  Most men are fine, but some
          get a little strange about [women
          aboard]....

                         CLAIRE
          "Strange" as in "superstitious"?

                         BRICE
          As in "strange."


INT. MANEUVERING ROOM

                         WEIRD WALLY
          "...his boots went thwuck, thwuck, thwuck
          through the boggy shallows.  Sweat and oil
          and grime clung to his Adonis brow.
          Suddenly his heart rolled over backwards
          in his chest as he saw the huge wretched
          thing before him..."

WEIRD WALLY, the boat's yeoman, reads from a pulp magazine.  He's
25 with a voracious imagination.  Listening in are Stumbo and
Pappy.  Pappy's feeding Crackerjack to his pet fish, kept in a
bowl suspended from the rafters.  ZAP enters and takes his post.
He's Pappy's right-hand guy.

                         ZAP
          Weird Wally, at it again.

                         WEIRD WALLY
          "Instantly its mouth widened into a
          terrible and hungry menace.  Now the
          malediction uttered a deep-throated
          sound...."

                         PAPPY
          "Malediction?"

                         WEIRD WALLY
          Look it up.  "...and its breath stank
          gloriously of rotted carp and matted
          gorilla skins and bilge-water.  Now it
          slouched toward him...not fast, but
          slowly, slowly, so very slowly...."

<u>CRACKING METAL jars them</u> -- but it's only a bulkhead settling
under pressure.  Gauges show the sub trimming lower.

                         STUMBO
          Whazzis story called again?

Weird Wally flips to the cover of the "Incredibly Weird Tales"
pulp.  A banner reads "Strange! Mysterious! Satanic!"

                         WEIRD WALLY
          "The She-Witch of Blood Lake...."

                         STUMBO
          <u>Another</u> female....

                         PAPPY
          I don't wanna hear this shit no more.

                         WEIRD WALLY
          This is classic fiction here.

                         PAPPY
          Hey, "Farewell to Arms" is classic
          fiction.  "Incredibly Weird Tales?"
          Chicken-fried ass-wipe.  Now get outta
          here, alla you.  This is the maneuvering
          room, and I can't maneuver with all you
          bull-slingers cloggin' up the --

A MANEUVERING BELL.  Telegraphs clank over to "2/3" speed.  Pappy
and Zap yank levers, making it so.  Skimming through the room now
is the CHIEF of the boat, 35.

                         CHIEF
          Look alive, Stumpie.  Got a U-boat out
          there....

                         STUMBO
          Hey, Chief?  Krauts don't name their subs
          after females, do they?


INT. FORWARD CORRIDOR

Brice is passing when he spots...

Claire in her cabin.  She uses a blade to cut new dressings for
Schillings, who lies naked under a blanket.  Presently Schillings
stirs.  Claire leans down to WHISPER SOMETHING in his ear.

Brice watches.  Is the guy awake?  Or is Claire just talking to
him like you might talk to a coma patient?


INT. CONTROL ROOM

                         LOOMIS
          What exactly bothers you?

Odell and Loomis confer privately.  Loomis bounces a yo-yo while
they talk:  It helps him shed stress.

                         ODELL
          Well, you got a slow-sinking ship -- slow
          enough to get at least a few lifeboats
          off.  But this U-boat only fires one
          torpedo the whole time.  That's not
          textbook German tactics.  They keep firing
          until the target is sunk.

                         LOOMIS
          So it was their last torpedo.

                         ODELL
          Why didn't they use their deck guns?

                         LOOMIS
          What is this, Odell?  Second patrol?

                         ODELL
          My third.

                         LOOMIS
          And your first was a little shakedown run
          off the coast of Florida in one of those
          old school boats?

                         ODELL
          Just wondering if their story doesn't seem
          a little..."off."

                         LOOMIS
          Wouldn't worry about it, champ -- they got
          here somehow.  Hey, want coffee?

                         ODELL
          Sure.

                         LOOMIS
          Two cups.  Sweet and blonde for me.

He yo-yos away.  If we weren't sure who the junior officer was
before this conversation, we are now.


INT. CONNING TOWER

Sonar #1 presses headphones tighter to his ear.  He's
eavesdropping on the outside world via...


EXT. MANTA - UNDERWATER - DAY

A hydrophone on the deck of the sub.


INT. CONNING TOWER

The sonar guy fast-clicks at Coors.  <i>"Got somethin' here."</i>  Coors
grabs the growler phone and gives it a crank.

                         COORS
          Sonar contact.


INT. STATEROOM

In his cabin, Kingsley sees Brice double-timing past.


INT. CONNING TOWER

Brice listens on spare headphones.  We hear it now too:  The
SWISH-SWISH-SWISH of turning screws.

Stopwatch in hand, Sonar #1 counts turns-per-minute.

                         SONAR #1
          90-plus turns.  Could be a destroyer,
          could be....

                         LOOMIS
          That Rhine Class.  Maybe we didn't shake
          him after all.


INT. CONTROL ROOM

Kingsley and Claire enter.  Odell and Coors are here, listening
to...

SWISH-SWISH-SWISH.  It's coming through the hull now.  All eyes
turn upward.


EXT. GERMAN HULL - UNDERWATER - DAY

The cruiser powers overhead, parting our hair with its keel.  But
now the screws shut down...


INT. CONNING TOWER

...and the SWISHING DIES.

                         SONAR #1
          Listening for us....

                         BRICE
          Full stop!

                         LOOMIS
          Full stop!  Rig for quiet!


INT. MANEUVERING ROOM

As Pappy lunges on his levers.


EXT. MANTA - UNDERWATER - DAY

As the Manta's screws shut down.


INT. MANTA - RIG-FOR-QUIET MONTAGE

SELECTED SHOTS of the crew going church-mouse quiet:

Odell clicking off a SQUEAKY FAN...

A blueshirt snoring in his bunk, Hoag closing the guy's mouth...

Someone shooing a pet hamster off its exercise wheel..

In the ship's office, Weird Wally stopping typing, putting his
feet up, diving into some pulp fiction.  He actually <u>likes</u> these
moments.


INT. CONNING TOWER

                         SONAR #1
                    (whispering)
          How could they know we're here....

                         BRICE
                    (to helmsman)
          10 degrees down-bubble.  Find us some
          cold.
                    (down the hatch)
          Get on the thermograph, Mr. Odell.


EXT. MANTA - UNDERWATER - DAY

As the Manta drifts lower.


INT. CONTROL ROOM

CLOSE on the bathy-thermograph, a gauge of outside water
temperature.  Its stylus scratches out a line that now eeks lower.

                         ODELL
                    (into growler)
          Right there.  Five-degree gradient at
          2-1-0 feet.

He finds Claire and Kingsley watching.

                         ODELL
          Colder water...deflects sound waves...just
          in case they start to --

PING!  It cuts right through the hull, right through our <u>skulls</u>.


INT. CONNING TOWER

As the sonar guy tears off his headphones.


INT. MANTA - PINGING MONTAGE

REACTION SHOTS as the PINGING is heard bow to stern.

Pappy starts stuffing his ears with cotton.  Other blueshirts
follow suit.  Some even bite down on rags.

In the control room, Kingsley turns and hobbles out:  He thinks he
knows what's coming -- and wants no part of it.


INT. CONNING TOWER

The PINGING ENDS abruptly.  Now an itchy silence.  Is this when
the depth-charges come?  Loomis looks at...

The sonar guy.  <i>"Anything?"</i>  He wags his head.  <i>"They ain't doin'
nothin'."</i>


INT. CONTROL ROOM

CLOSE on the bathy-thermograph.  No one is watching it now except
us -- and we see it take a another big drop.

Claire hugs herself, feeling the cold.

CLOSE on faces.  Tight.  Grim.  Silent.  The grand pause is
shattered by...

                         FRANK SINATRA
          "I'll be seeing you...in all the old
          familiar places...."

The MUSIC IS INSANELY LOUD.  At first no one knows where it's
coming from.  Then Odell lurches past Claire...


INT. OFFICERS' WARDROOM - CONTINUOUS

...and enters the empty wardroom.  <u>The phonograph is playing</u>.
RRRRRRRRIIIP:  Odell slaps the needle off-track.

Silence again.

Brice appears.  He glares at the record player.  Then glares at
Odell.

                         ODELL
          Have no idea, sir.  I just ran in and it
          was already --


INT. CONNING TOWER

                         SONAR #1
          Splashes!

                         LOOMIS
                    (down the hatch)
          Splashes!


EXT. MANTA - UNDERWATER - DAY

DEPTH-CHARGE POV:  With CAMERA RIDING the back of the depth-
charge, we plummet through water.  At first we see only more
barrels dropping around us.  But soon we spy our target, the
Manta, looming up out of the murk.  In a blinding flash, WE
EXPLODE.


INT. MANTA - CONCUSSION MONTAGE

CONCUSSIONS rock the sub.  We see lockers flying open...

Bakelite boards shattering... 

Someone's <u>front teeth</u> shattering...

The control-room depth gauge knocked off the wall...

And blueshirts knocked out of their bunks.


EXT. MANTA - UNDERWATER - DAY

The Manta runs a GAUNTLET OF EXPLOSIONS that batters the sub from
side to side.  The last depth-charge is a wicked down-firing
EXPLOSION.


INT. FORWARD TORPEDO ROOM

Instantly the sub loses depth.  Everyone pile-drives into the
ceiling...

...<u>gets pancaked there for a few seconds</u>...

...then gets thrown back to the floor.  Electrical PANELS BLOW.
White lights die.


EXT. MANTA - UNDERWATER - DAY

One last depth-charge rains down...strikes the Manta's bow...and
starts tumbling down the deck. 


INT. MANTA - CLANK-CLANK MONTAGE

Stressed-out faces.  Seen only by red light.  Listening to that
one BARREL CLANK-CLANK-CLANK over their heads.


EXT. MANTA - UNDERWATER - DAY

The depth-charge comes to a stop near the bridge.  It just sits
there.  Unexploded.


INT. CONTROL ROOM

The SWISHING STARTS UP again:  The enemy ship is moving on.

We wait as another ROUND OF DEPTH-CHARGES goes off, more distant
now.  The SWISHING FADES AWAY.

Blueshirts start bungling forward from aft rooms, jamming the
control room doorway.

                         BLUESHIRTS
                    (overlapping)
          Shit on a stick, was that a dud?  And who
          the fuck was playing music?  Huh?  Trying
          to get us killed?

                         LOOMIS
          Back to stations!  I want reports!  BACK
          TO YOUR STATIONS!


INT. CREW MESS

The boat has stabilized.  The mess room is now a temporary trauma
center for the wounded, Odell doing what he can.  The case load is
eased by Claire, who stitches shut a gash on the inner thigh of...

                         ZAP
          Christ, 'zat all <u>my</u> blood?  Runnin' 'cross
          the floor like that?

                         CLAIRE
          Only a pint.  Tighter, keep the tourniquet
          tighter.

                         ZAP
          Think I may faint.

                         CLAIRE
          Hold on, hold on.  Don't take this wrong
          now....

She buries her face is his lap to chew off the stitch.

                         CLAIRE
          Better?

                         ZAP
          Completely.

Claire smiles.  <i>"Thought so."</i>  She turns to look for another
patient and comes nose to nose with...

                         BRICE
          I asked you to stay forward.

                         ODELL
          My idea, sir.  She's a certified med-tech,
          which may be the nearest thing to a doctor
          we've --

                         BRICE
                    (to Claire)
          Were you or Mr. Kingsley in the wardroom
          before the attack?  Just prior?

                         CLAIRE
          I was in the control room, as I believe
          Kingsley was, too.

                         BRICE
          He was with you the whole time?

                         CLAIRE
          Be quicker, lieutenant, if you just tell
          me what you're after.  Are you suggesting
          that one of us is responsible for the --

A rising REVVING-SCREECHING SOUND stops them both -- stops
everyone here.  It's the kind of sound you <u>never</u> want to hear
aboard a submarine.  Brice takes off.  Odell is right behind.

                         ODELL
                    (to Claire)
          Keep working!  Please!


INT. FORWARD CORRIDOR

Running toward the SOUND, Brice collides with Chief.

                         CHIEF
          Hot fish, out of the tube!  Forward room!


INT. FORWARD TORPEDO ROOM

Brice reaches the doorway to see...

Chaos:  A torpedo runs wild in its moorings, PROPELLER SCREAMING
at 10,000 rpm and spewing steam everywhere.  Stumbo and Hoag and a
few others are grappling with it, but it's like trying to wrestle
a car.

Odell jumps into the fray.  Chief starts to join in, too -- but
turns back, a new shade of pale.

                         CHIEF
          Mark-14.  It'll detonate magnetically,
          around any steel hull, after 500 yards.

                         BRICE
          So?  It's not moving.

                         CHIEF
          The boat is.

A horrible beat.


INT. MANEUVERING ROOM

As telegraphs slam over to "EMERGENCY REVERSE."


EXT. MANTA - UNDERWATER - DAY

As screws start spinning backwards.


EXT. MANTA - UNDERWATER - DAY

As the Manta slows -- but doesn't stop.


INT. FORWARD TORPEDO ROOM

The battle rages.  There's so much exhaust that it's hard to tell
who's doing what.

                         CHIEF
          Get it out, get it out, just get it out
          the god damn tube!

The men start working as a team:  Odell opens a torpedo tube as...

Others start cranking the come-along wench and...

More bodies lean on the cable to help move...

The SCREAMING TORPEDO.  It inches toward the open tube.


INT. CONTROL ROOM

                         BRICE
          Torpedo party to the tower!  Now, now,
          now, now, now!

Brice races in.  Battle stations over the IMC:  BONG-BONG-BONG-
BONG....


INT. CONNING TOWER

The torpedo party double-times up the ladder.

                         LOOMIS
          Open outer doors!  Bow tubes!


EXT. MANTA - UNDERWATER - DAY

As the outer torpedo doors open.


INT. FORWARD TORPEDO ROOM

The Chief has the torpedo in its tube.  Fighting the exhaust, it
takes a several bodies just to close the door.

                         ODELL
                    (into IMC)
          Fish in the barrel, sir!


INT. CONNING TOWER

                         LOOMIS
          Flood number two tube!


INT. FORWARD TORPEDO ROOM

They hear the WATER FLOODING the tube and HITTING THE PROPS.  It
sounds like a nuclear garbage disposal.

                         CHIEF
          Go, go, go, go, go....


EXT. MANTA - UNDERWATER - DAY

As the torpedo corkscrews out of the sub.


INT. CONNING TOWER

                         LOOMIS
          Torpedo underway!

                         BRICE
          Hard left rudder!


EXT. MANTA - UNDERWATER - DAY

Maneuvering faster than we thought a sub could, the Manta veers
away, <u>backs</u> away from the torpedo that now spirals right toward
CAMERA.  It BLOWS in our face.


INT. MANTA - DETONATION MONTAGE

MULTIPLE SHOTS of the sub rocked by the detonation.  Lights
sputter, insulation cracks free and rains down on heads -- but all
told, it could've been worse.  Much worse.


INT. CONNING TOWER

An hour later.  The boat's five officers -- Brice, Loomis, Coors,
Odell, and Chief -- hold summit in the tower.

                         LOOMIS
          ...well, maybe the phonograph wasn't
          secured...and maybe the intercom was left
          "on"...and maybe that fish went haywire
          for no reason, but god<u>damn</u>....

Traded looks.  Are they thinking the same thing?  That it all
started when the Brits came aboard?

                         COORS
          And maybe someone's trying to kill us.

                         BRICE
                    (to Odell)
          Miss Paige claims she was in the control
          room the whole time.

                         ODELL
          I think that's right.

                         BRICE
          So what about the other one?

                         ODELL
          Kingsley?

                         COORS
          If that's his name.  Where was he when it
          all happened?

                         ODELL
          Not sure.  May've stepped out.

                         COORS
          "Stepped" out?  Or "slipped" out?

                         LOOMIS
          You know, maybe we're spending more time
          watchin' pretty little Missy than we are
          watchin' our backs.

Odell double-takes:  Loomis is staring at him.

                         ODELL
          Me?  I've talked to her twice.

                         LOOMIS
          About what?

                         COORS
          Heard you were bird-doggin' her, Odell.

                         LOOMIS
          Been runnin' your mouth, ensign?  About
          boat-matters?

It knocks Odell off-balance.  <i>"Why are they pouncing on me?"</i>

                         ODELL
          Wai', wai', wait.  Chief.  Wasn't there a
          maintenance bulletin on Mark-14s?
          Something about self-starting?

                         CHIEF
                    (nodding)
          Got a history of twitchy behavior.
                    (to others)
          And as for the record player goin' off --
          well, yeah, that's strange, but I'm not
          sure it calls for a lynching party.  Maybe
          we should all just take a deep breath
          and --

The PHONE GROWLS.  Brice grabs it.

                         BRICE
          Brice.

                         STEWARD (O.S./GROWLER)
          'Tenant, need you back in mess.  Straight
          away.


INT. CREW MESS

Blueshirts watch anxiously as the steward shows Brice a pair of
oily trousers.

                         STEWARD
          Was all set to toss 'em out.  Then I
          noticed this.

CLOSE on the inside waistband.  It's stitched "Sonderklasse Firma,
Berlin."

                         BRICE
          These came from....

                         STEWARD
          The half-dead guy.


INT. ARMORY LOCKER - AFT TORPEDO ROOM

CLOSE on ankle-chains being broken out.  Just for insurance, a
Browning sidearm is loaded.


INT. CONTROL ROOM

Heads turn as...

The arrest party crosses the control room in wide strides.  Brice
has the pistol.


INT. CLAIRE'S STATEROOM/FORWARD CORRIDOR

Claire is here, checking up on Schillings.  Hearing FEET APPROACH,
she turns and finds the men choking her doorway.

                         BRICE
          Wake him up.

                         CLAIRE
          I'm sorry, I'm not sure what --

                         BRICE
          Wake the German up.

Her mouth opens but no words come out.  Eerily, Schillings rolls
over in his bunk and locks eyes with Brice.

                         SCHILLINGS
          Hallo, mein kapitän.

He's attempting to show grace under pressure.  It goes
unappreciated.

                         STUMBO
          Jesus.....

                         CLAIRE
                    (preemptively)
          I'm the one who asked him not to speak.
          Me.  I just thought it would be better if
          we all could think of him as any other --

                         STUMBO
          She had 'im right under our noses...whole
          goddamn time....

None too gently, Brice evicts Claire from the room, putting her in
Odell's restraining arms.

                         BRICE
          Away.

Odell struggles to remove Claire, in part because she won't go
gently, in part because she starts pleading her case directly to
him.  With growing desperation:

                         CLAIRE
          I'll tell you, I'll tell you everything.
          His name is Bernard Schillings, he's a
          downed aviator and a patient of mine.
          He's a prisoner of war, which means he's
          entitled to protection under the Geneva
          Conv --

                         ODELL
          Got to come this way, ma'am.

                         CLAIRE
          He had no cause to do those things...he
          has a family, children...he wants to get
          home just like the rest of us....

                         ODELL
          Let them sort it out....

                         CLAIRE
          Doesn't matter whose side he's on now....

                         ODELL
          Be all right, really, just....

INTERCUT Claire and Odell with...

Brice and Schillings.  Now in quick escalating moves:

Someone brandishes the chains.

Schillings sits up quickly, getting his feet under him.  He
doesn't know if they're about to chain him -- or beat him.

Brice shows his pistol.

Schillings' reaches for the blade left by Claire.

Brice <u>levels</u> the pistol.

Schillings' hand.  Hovering over the blade.

Brice's face:  <i>"Don't."</i>

Schillings' eyes.  Darting.  <u>Panicking</u>.

We're BACK ON Claire and Odell for the GUNSHOT.  They flinch
together.


INT. CONTROL ROOM

As heads spin to the SOUND.


INT. FORWARD CORRIDOR

The men part as Brice exits the stateroom.

Claire breaks from Odell and starts for the cabin.  Brice slams a
hand against the opposite wall, blocking her.  She sees the back-
splash of blood on his shirt sleeve.  His pistol sleeve.

                         BRICE
          You should have told me.

                         CLAIRE
                    (overwhelmed)
          Maybe I was worried that...that you would
          do exactly what you did.

                         BRICE
          You should have told me no matter what,
          because your little secret nearly cost
          every man here his life.

                         CLAIRE
          But he had no reason to --

                         BRICE
          Mr. Odell, the woman is confined to
          quarters for the duration of patrol.  If
          she asks to use the toilet, you are to
          bring her a bucket.  Stumbo, secure the
          body.

                         STUMBO
          Fuckin' A-1, sir.

                         BRICE
          Mr. Loomis, conn is yours.  I'll be in my
          berth -- sleeping.

He leaves.  Stumbo cobra-spits in the general direction of...

                         CLAIRE
                    (forceless, still
                     trying to
                     explain)
          I just wanted to save one...just one of my
          patients....

She searches faces for a hint of understanding.  Odell is the only
one who will even meet her eyes.


INT. SKIPPER'S STATEROOM

Behind drawn curtains, Brice removes his bloody shirt, puts it in
a laundry sack.  Unlaces his shoes.  Finds more blood on his
hands, washes it off.  Lies back on the bunk.  Clicks off a light.
Blows a long sigh and finally, finally closes his eyes.

                         FRANK SINATRA
          "I'll be seeing you..."

The eyes leap open.

                         FRANK SINATRA
          "...in all the old familiar places...."

                         BRICE
                    (breathless)
          No....

It <u>wasn't</u> the German.


INT. CLAIRE'S STATEROOM

As Claire rolls over in her bunk, hearing.


INT. OFFICERS' WARDROOM

CLOSE on the phonograph.  Spinning away.

Brice stares -- then snatches the record off the turn-table and
smashes it.  He smashes every goddamn record he can find.

                         BRICE
          So who's screwing with me?  Huh?


INT. FORWARD CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Stepping out:

                         BRICE
          WHICH ONE OF YOU IS DOING THIS NOW?

It echoes the length of the boat.  Only the WHALES ANSWER.  But
this time their cries are different -- sounding somehow less
animal than before.  More human.


EXT. MANTA - UNDERWATER - DAY

The Manta plows on through the murk.  There are no whales.  Just
the submarine.  Alone.

                                                          FADE OUT


INT. FORWARD TORPEDO ROOM

Stumbo finishes mummy-wrapping Schillings' body in canvas.  Seeped
blood shows the fatal wound.

Deeper in the room we find Brice, Loomis, Coors.  The three
lieutenants have retreated to the forward end of the boat for a
discreet talk.  Odell enters and joins.

                         LOOMIS
          How're those hydrogen levels?

                         ODELL
          Almost three percent.  Chief says we need
          to vent before long.

                         BRICE
          We'll ride surface tonight.  2100 hours.

Odell nods and waits for the discreet talk to continue, assuming
he's welcome.  Instead...

                         BRICE
          Something else?

                         ODELL
          Well, just.... I can't believe it's one of
          our own hands doing this.  Seven weeks, I
          think I know most the guys now.  Just
          don't believe it's one of them.

                         BRICE
          Been a rough patrol -- men do strange
          things under duress.  Want you to keep
          your eyes open, Odell.  Could be anyone.

                         ODELL
          Aye-aye.

Odell withdraws to the doorway.

                         STUMBO
          Maybe we could vent our bleeder, too.

                         ODELL
          Say again?

                         STUMBO
          Little Missy.  Never trust anything that
          bleeds for five days and don't die, I
          always [say] --

                         ODELL
          Shut up, Stumbo.  Just shut your stupid
          mouth.

The three lieutenants watch as Odell leaves.

                         LOOMIS
          Bright kid, Odell.


INT. IRON LUNG - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

We're in a metal cylinder.  But where?  Is this the inside of a
torpedo tube?  As we adjust to the dim light, we find ourselves
looking at the frail body of a 10-year-old girl.  A hand comes up
to try and scratch her nose...

But the hand bumps into a bulkhead.  Blocked.


INT. CHILD'S ROOM - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

On the other side of the bulkhead, the 10-YEAR-OLD GIRL screws up
her nose in lieu of scratching it.  It doesn't help.

WIDER TO reveal a child's room, dolls and other timeless
playthings in evidence.  Completely out of place here is an iron-
lung machine -- hulking, ugly, loathsome -- a coffin for the not-
yet-dead.  Baffles rise and fall, GASPING in sync with the girl's
own RASPY BREATHING.

Unable to sleep, the girl searches the mirror mounted above her
face.

HER POV:  Of a half-open door behind her.  A light is on in the
outer hallway.  O.S. VOICES.  Is it morning yet?  Is it time to
get out now?

The silhouette of an adult -- HER MOTHER, maybe -- enters and
speaks from the doorway.

                         LABORED VOICE
          You shouldn't be here....


INT. CLAIRE'S STATEROOM

Claire wakes -- and finds herself breathing badly.  It takes her a
moment to normalize her breath, to remember where she is.  Now,
twenty years late, Claire scratches her nose.

                         LABORED VOICE
          You should get off when you can....

<i>"Wasn't that voice in my dream?"</i>  Claire peers at the bunk below.
<u>There's someone there</u>.

                         LABORED VOICE
          Get off before it's too late....

She reaches for the light.


INT. CONTROL ROOM

A SCREAM.


INT. FORWARD CORRIDOR/CLAIRE'S STATEROOM

Brice lopes forward.  Others have beaten him here, including Odell
and Kingsley.  Brice pushes through to see...

<u>Schillings back in his bunk</u>, face exposed, petrified mouth open.

                         CLAIRE
          I thought he...spoke to me.

                         KINGSLEY
          Claire....

                         CLAIRE
          No, it wasn't his voice, but it <u>was</u>...I
          mean....

                         KINGSLEY
          <u>Claire</u>.

Claire takes another look -- and sees things differently now in
full light.  Schillings is clearly dead.  Her fright giving way to
anger, Claire looks back at...

Stumbo and Hoag.  Hiding their grins.

                         CLAIRE
                    (going after them)
          Is this what you do for sport?  You have
          nothing better to do in the midst of a war
          than to play sick little jokes with --

Odell wedges between.

                         ODELL
          Okay, it's over, it's over....

                         BRICE
                    (re body)
          Wrap it back up, Stumpie.  We'll dump him
          when we surface.

                         CLAIRE
          A bit more respect for the dead might be
          in order, Mr. Brice.  From everyone aboard
          this ship.

                         BRICE
          This is a "boat" you're a guest on, not a
          "ship."

                         CLAIRE
          I won't forget.


INT. CONTROL ROOM

The body, rewrapped, is carried into the control room by Stumbo
and Hoag.

                         HOAG
                    (with labored
                     voice)
          "Get off before it's too late...."

Stumbo mock-screams in imitation of Claire.  We understand that
Hoag was the ventriloquist.


INT. CONNING TOWER

Hoisted up into the tower, the corpse gets dumped behind the
second-string sound man, SONAR #2.

                         STUMBO
          Compliments of the C.O.

                         SONAR #2
          I'll thank him when I see him.

Getting a whiff, he clicks on a fan.  Hoag starts below.  Stumbo
starts adding chains to the corpse's ankles in anticipation of a
sea-burial.


INT. CLAIRE'S STATEROOM

Kingsley limps in with two coffees.

                         KINGSLEY
          Since no one seems able to sleep anyway...
          try some of this motor oil they call
          "coffee"....

He finds Claire reclined ungainly, her head craned back so as to
open her breathing passage.  She's having difficulties.

                         KINGSLEY
          Claire?

                         CLAIRE
          Changing, isn't it?  The air.

                         KINGSLEY
          Think you'll pull through?

                         CLAIRE
                    (indicating her
                     chest)
          Comes and goes.  Polio-myelitis, growing
          up.  Didn't breathe well when I slept, so
          every night -- eight months running --
          they stuck me in an iron lung.

Kingsley winces, seeing the irony of being stuck aboard a
submarine now.

                         KINGSLEY
          I saw you down in the respirator ward, of
          course, working with all the patients, but
          I never knew....

                         CLAIRE
          Was so wretched that I swore I'd help
          other people through it, someday, if I
          could....
                    (eyeing the curved
                     hull around her)
          Maybe it's just all this metal...this
          "boat" of theirs.  Something not right
          about it...sealed off...living below the
          real world....

                         KINGSLEY
          We're scarcely the people to complain,
          Claire.  Especially after what with
          Schillings -- which you know I thought was
          a mistake.

                         CLAIRE
                    (not listening)
          Something not right....


INT. CONTROL ROOM

Electrical mates replace vacuum tubes in the radar boards, Coors
supervising.  Behind their backs...

The bathy-thermograph.  The stylus is etching lower again:  We're
entering cold water.  Or at least that's what the gauge says.

                         PLANESMAN #1
          Can have it any temperature you want --
          'long as it's either "too hot" or "too
          cold."

He punches into a over-shirt.


INT. CONNING TOWER

Stumbo is hooking weights to the corpse.  Soon he notices...

The pool of blood expanding on the canvas.  Is it possible?  Do
dead bodies still bleed like this?  Stumbo tries to shrug it off
and get back to work.  He <u>tries</u>.

                         HOARSE WHISPER
          So much dark....

The voice was like a rusty hinge.  Stumbo shoots a look down the
hatch, but Hoag is long gone.  That means the voice must've come
from...

Sonar #2, the only other person here.

                         STUMBO
          Nice try.  Hoag tell you?  He musta
          toldja.

The sound man never turns around.  Is he pretending to not hear?

                         HOARSE WHISPER
          ... trying...trying to find the way back,
          but...

Stumbo spins to face the corpse.  <i>"No fucking way."</i>  He eases his
ear to the canvas-wrapped head.

                         HOARSE WHISPER
          ...but it's so cold here....


INT. CONTROL ROOM

WHUMP!  Stumbo hits the control room floor like a sack of
groceries.  He just fell from the tower and landed behind...

                         COORS
          'Smatter?  Stumpie?

Eyes riveted on the conning tower, Stumbo <u>backs</u> out of the control
room.


INT. MANEUVERING ROOM

                         STUMBO
          ...tellin' ya, some baaaad hoodoo on this
          boat.

Zap and a MESS STEWARD are giving Stumbo the time of day, but
Pappy's in no mood.

                         PAPPY
          Hey, Stumbo?  Mighta worked on the female,
          but not me.  Go try --

                         STUMBO
          Fuck the Brillo pad, this ain't about her.
          <u>It talked to me</u>.

                         ZAP
          The dead guy.

                         STUMBO
          The dead Kraut.

                         PAPPY
          Uh-huh.  And did he talk to you in English
          or German?

                         STUMBO
          Well, it was, uh...English, I guess.

                         PAPPY
          Case closed.  Give it a blow, huh?  You're
          upsettin' my lucky fish.

                         MESS STEWARD
          Stumbo, you wouldn't also happen to be the
          Sinatra fan, wouldja?

                         STUMBO
          Go up there.  Right now.  Don't believe
          me?  Listen to the dead guy.

                         MESS STEWARD
          I gotta milk the cows.

The steward starts to leave.  Stumbo reels him back with a new
thought.

                         STUMBO
          What if...you know...what if it's "him"?

Even though we don't, everyone here knows who "him" is, and the
thought, no matter how crazy, drops a guillotine blade on the
conversation.  Off their mute faces, CUT TO:


INT. CONNING TOWER

A clock shows 2100 hours.

                         BRICE
          Let's take a look.

Loomis jerks the alarm-box.


INT. FORWARD CORRIDOR

AHOOGA-AHOOGA-AHOOGA.

                         LOOMIS (O.S./1MC)
          Rig for surface.  Prepare to charge
          batteries and take on air through main
          induction.

Officers and blue shirts file past on their way to stations.  When
the forward section of the boat has thinned out, Kingsley hobbles
into the corridor -- followed by Claire.

Claire walks the hall, breathing deep, stretching her legs,
testing her leash.  All cabins here have name-plates that list
quartered officers.  But at Brice's cabin, Claire notices...

No name-plate.  Just the ghost-image of one that <u>used</u> to be here.

Claire eases open the curtain to see...

A bunk, chair, clothes locker, fold-down desk, stand-up photo of
Brice and his wife.  And a book on the desk.  The "PATROL LOG."

A thinking beat.  Claire signals "one-minute" to Kingsley, then
slips...


INT. SKIPPER'S STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS

...inside.  Claire opens the patrol log with one guilty finger --
<u>and suddenly the pages go blood red</u>, startling her.

                         LOOMIS (O.S./1MC)
          Switching to night lights.


INT. CONNING TOWER

More red lights activate as:

                         LOOMIS
          Eight degrees up-bubble.  We're on our way
          to 65 feet.


EXT. MANTA - UNDERWATER - NIGHT

As the Manta angles toward the surface.


INT. SKIPPER'S STATEROOM

Eyes adjusting to the red lights, Claire begins reading the patrol
log.

                         CLAIRE (V.O.)
          "1420 hours.  Took periscope photos of
          German sub-pens at Lorient before moving
          on to areas north.  O.N.I. should be happy
          with results.  1550 hours.  Saw multiple
          shipping targets but passed on all.  Men
          getting itchy to come home with at least
          one kill..."

She stops cold, <u>hearing an UNKNOWN MAN'S VOICE</u> speaking the words
right along with her.  Claire actually checks over her shoulder
before continuing.

                         CLAIRE (V.O.)
          "...but so far I'm resisting the
          temptation, staying focused on primary
          mission of photo recon...."

The voice is gone.  Was her head just playing games with her?


EXT. MANTA - UNDERWATER - NIGHT

As our periscope, seen from below, breaks the surface.


INT. CONNING TOWER

PERISCOPE POV:  Through big dark swells, we spy moonlight on the
surface.

Loomis passes the scope to Brice.

                         LOOMIS 
          Some tall grass out there....

                         BRICE
          Good skies, though.  Should be able to
          shoot the stars and lock our position.
          Well done.
                    (to Coors)
          Sextant.  In my cabin.


INT. SKIPPER'S STATEROOM

The sextant.  In an open box, it sits right next to...

Claire.  She flips ahead, finds a conspicuously blank page.  <i>"What</i>
<i>goes here?"</i>  She flips further ahead to read.

                         CLAIRE (V.O.)
          "0840 hours.  Picked up three survivors
          from the Fort James, British merchantman
          and hospital ship, reportedly victims of a
          German U-boat..."
                    (huffy)
          "Reportedly."

CLOSE on a cross.  It's been doodled in the margins by Brice,
presumably.  Claire notes it and flips on.


INT. CONTROL ROOM

As Coors drops down the ladder and heads forward.


INT. SKIPPER'S STATEROOM

Noticing something, Claire flips back and forth between two
entries:  <u>They're written by different hands</u>.  Now Claire checks
the front of the patrol log and finds reference to...

"Lt. Cmdr. Winters."

Frowning, Claire eases open a locker.  Taped up inside are photos
of an officer we haven't yet seen, the 40ish WINTERS.

Her frown deepens.  <i>"Just who's cabin is this?"</i>

                         KINGSLEY (O.S.)
          ...wondering where a fellow could get a
          little Earl Grey tea....

                         COORS (O.S.)
          Check with the mess steward.

Claire is about to close the locker when she notices one last
photo.  This one transfixes her.


INT. FORWARD CORRIDOR

                         KINGSLEY
                    (stalling)
          So we'll be surfacing soon?  Taking on
          some fresh air?

                         COORS
          Trying to.

He slaps open the curtain...


INT. SKIPPER'S STATEROOM

...and pulls up short.  Claire lies quietly on the bunk.

                         COORS
          What're you doing here?

                         CLAIRE
          Hmm?  Oh, wasn't feeling comfortable in my
          room -- what with the bloody walls.
          Didn't think anyone would --

                         COORS
          Shouldn't be in the skipper's cabin
          without permission.

                         CLAIRE
          Gladly ask him.  Mr. Brice is the skipper,
          isn't he?

It thumbs a nerve in Coors:  Is the question as innocent as it
sounds?  Or is she baiting him?  He grabs the sextant.

                         COORS
          Lieutenant Brice is the current C.O. of
          this boat.  And you need his permission to
          be anywhere besides your assigned
          quarters.

He holds open the curtain.  She takes the hint.


INT. CLAIRE'S ROOM/FORWARD CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Claire waits until Coors is gone before removing the last photo
from her shirt.

CLOSER, we see it shows two men shaking hands at a U.S.O.
function.  One we take to be Winters.  The other is Frank Sinatra.


INT. CONNING TOWER

CLOSE on the depth-gauge.  "0" feet.

A look-out is spinning the wheel of the bridge hatch, about to
open it.  We're seconds from breathing fresh air when...

                         SONAR #2
          Screws kicking over!  Starboard quarter!

Brice lunges to the periscope, swings it around fast.

PERISCOPE POV:  A hulking silhouette crosses the wedge of
moonlight.  <u>It's the German heavy</u>.

                         BRICE
          Periscope down!  Emergency dive!

                         LOOMIS
          Emergency dive!  Blow negative and cycle
          the vents!

AHOOGA-AHOOGA.

The periscope plummets.

The hatch is cranked shut.

The Christmas tree goes green.

Ballast levers are jerked.

Plane wheels get spun hard.


EXT. GERMAN HULL - UNDERWATER - NIGHT

We hear DISEMBODIED PINGING.  Suddenly the hull of the German ship
passes overhead, hydrophones prominent.


INT. CONNING TOWER

With all eyes on the ceiling:

                         LOOMIS
          How the hell they know?

                         BRICE
          Depth to keel?

                         HELMSMAN
          120, sir.

A beat.

                         BRICE
          Let's use it all.


EXT. MANTA - UNDERWATER - NIGHT

As the Manta descends.


INT. CONNING TOWER

                         LOOMIS
                   (to helmsman)
          Trim it off...trim it off...and...all
          stop.


EXT. MANTA - UNDERWATER - NIGHT

The Manta's props.  Shutting down.


INT. FORWARD CORRIDOR

Claire and Kingsley hear the sub go eerily quiet before...

A SIX-CHANNEL BOOM.  It jolts them hard.


INT. CONTROL ROOM

Looking for answers, Kingsley hobbles in.  He manages to corner
Coors.

                         KINGSLEY
          What?  What did we hit?

                         COORS
          Just the bottom.

                         KINGSLEY
          "Just the...."  Well, just how long can we
          stay down here?  Before the CO2 gets so --

                         COORS
          Don't worry about CO2.

                         KINGSLEY
          Don't?

                         COORS
          "Hydrogen."

Enigmatically, Coors moves on.  But Odell overheard.

                         ODELL
          We use the diesels above, batteries below
          -- and the batteries off-gas hydrogen.  As
          for "how long"...

                         LOOMIS (O.S./1MC)
          Rig for quiet.  All hands ordered to racks
          unless on watch -- no extraneous activity.
          And the smoking lamp is out.

                         ODELL
          Guess we're gonna find out.


INT. ENGINE ROOM

MOTORMAC #1 takes a quick drag on his cigarette before moving to
stub it out.  But he catches himself, noticing...

The cigarette burning oddly.  Flaring unnaturally.

An ALARM SOUNDS.  Responding, Chief double-times in with Zap.
They drop through a floor hatch...


INT. BATTERY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

...and reach this area crammed with, literally, 200,000 pounds of
lead-acid battery cells.  Chief cranes his neck to check...

A ceiling-mounted hydrogen monitor.  The needle shows 5%, start of
the orange zone.

Chief kills the alarm.  The men swap looks.  <i>"Not good."</i>


INT. CREW QUARTERS

                         WEIRD WALLY
          "...Johnny tried whistling a little tune,
          but it didn't help -- his nerves were like
          old frayed electrical cords.  So he paused
          in the cold dead heart of the cemetery to
          light his last cigarette..."

Weird Wally's back at it, reading by hampster-light now:  The
hampster runs on a wheel, which turns a mini-generator, which
powers a small reading light, which provides the only white light
in the red-lit room.  The audience is noticeably larger than
before, and the men seem rapt by the latest installment of
"Incredibly Weird Tales."

                         WEIRD WALLY
          "Just then the pregnant moon ran away,
          wisely taking refuge behind the leaden
          clouds.  And now, beside Johnny's unwary
          foot, the ground -- the soft, wormy,
          freshly dug earth -- began to heave...."

Odell enters.  As he checks on the wounded, he sets about
confiscating matches and lighters from all the men.

                         ODELL
          How're those stitches holdin', Zap?  Good?
          Okay, matches, Zippos, c'mon, give 'em up,
          Chief wants 'em under lock and key....  Be
          right back to change those bandages,
          Meyers....

Ignitables get dumped in a bucket.  Odell reaches Weird Wally's
group.

                         ODELL
          What's <u>this</u> one called?

                         SONAR #1
          "The Undeniable Undead..."

                         HOAG
          'Bout these Chinese railroad workers,
          couple hundred years ago.  Buried alive.

                         STUMBO
                    (gravely)
          It's research.

                         SONAR #1
          They're dead, but not dead-dead, y'know?

                         HOAG
          Like on the farm, you chop a chicken,
          sometimes it don't die right off?  I seen
          this rooster chase a girl 'round a whole
          big barn once -- with no head.

                         WEIRD WALLY
          So...what happened to her head?

                         ODELL
          Wallace, you givin' everybody nightmares
          again?

                         WEIRD WALLY
          It's my calling, sir.

                         ODELL
          Well, stow it.  And gimme that Zippo,
          Hoag.

The group breaks up.  Sighing, Weird Wally dog-ears the page and
slips the 10-cent pulp inside his mattress cover.  Odell exits.
Instantly the pulp comes back out, the men regroup.

                         STUMBO
          So Wallace?  What's, like, the "theme" of
          the story?

                         WEIRD WALLY
          Saying that death can be a very imprecise
          thing.  Just because we want it to be
          clean and absolute, doesn't make it so.
          Sometimes death gets....

                         HOAG
          "Sloppy."

                         WEIRD WALLY
          "Sloppy."

                         STUMBO
          Very "sloppy."


INT. CLAIRE'S STATEROOM

A piss-bucket on the floor.  Used.

Claire is staring at the Sinatra photograph, absorbed in it until
she hears a creepy FLUTTERING-SLAPPING SOUND.  Where is it coming
from?

                         VOICE (O.S.)
          Seaweed...

Claire starts.  It's Brice, filling her doorway.

                         BRICE
          ...maybe a fishing net.  Gets caught up
          and slaps against the hull.  Hear a lot of
          strange things at depth.  I can't even
          identify them all.

The SOUND FADES.  Whatever it was.

                         BRICE
          So what should I do with you?  Hmm?  What
          would happen in your navy if a passenger
          defied orders aboard ship?  Chained up?
          Gagged?  What?

                         CLAIRE
          I'm sorry.  I regret not telling you about
          Schillings because...well, I should've
          realized that a submarine isn't a good
          place to keep secrets.  Is it?

Noting the double-edge of her words, Brice looks off.  Does he
have trouble meeting her eyes?

                         BRICE
          We were in a running battle with a German
          cruiser.  Took some licks in the depth-
          charging, but we finally got our shot in:
          Cracked its back with one torpedo.  We
          went topside to survey damage.  Ship was
          already gone, but there was a lot of
          debris in the water, and Winters decides
          to go down on deck and haul some in.
          Middle of the Atlantic, and he wants to do
          a little souvenir hunting -- something for
          his fireplace mantle, think he said.  I
          tried to talk him out of it, but....
          Anyway, the boat hit an underwater
          obstruction.  He fell, struck his head,
          went under before we could get to him.
                    (off her look)
          Heard you were asking.

                         CLAIRE
          So he drowned.

                         BRICE
          No real secret -- already radioed
          Connecticut with news of the accident.
                    (noting piss
                     bucket)
          Maybe we got off on the wrong foot, Miss
          Paige.  Feel free to move about the
          forward sections of the --

The overhead lights brighten...


INT. FORWARD CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

...<u>and flare out all at once</u>.  The corridor where Brice stands is
abruptly coffin dark.  Soon he perceives...

A silhouette at corridor's end, just mirroring his stare.  Who is
it?

                         SILHOUETTE/ZAP
          Sorry, sir.  Humidity builds up, trips out
          the power buss.  I'll get right on it.

It takes Brice a moment to shake it off:  It's almost like he was
expecting someone else.


INT. CLAIRE'S STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS

                         CLAIRE
          So would you reconsider England?  Finding
          a port there?

                         BRICE
          I'm sorry.

He withdraws...


INT. FORWARD CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

...and grabs a battle lantern off the wall.  When he flicks it on:

                         LOOMIS
          Sorry for what?

Loomis stands there mock-casual, one towel around his waist,
another drying his hair.

                         BRICE
          [She was] just asking about Winters.

                         LOOMIS
          And you told her....

                         BRICE
          The story.

Brice moves on, leaving Loomis in the dark.


INT. CONNING TOWER

                         ODELL
                    (urgently)
          So what is it?  Identify.

                         SONAR #2
          Coming up astern, but....

Odell snaps on headphones.  PUSH IN TIGHT as he hears the expected
SCREWS of the pursuit ship -- and then something else, too:  An
EERIE HARMONIC.

                         SONAR #2
          Don't know <u>what</u> that is....


EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT

Sweeping out of the murk is an array of steel cables.  Towed by
the German ship overhead, the CABLES THRUM LIKE CHELLO STRINGS as
they rush toward us.  Soon we see what the cables drag:

<u>Hooks</u>.  Oversized grappling hooks, each coming for us like some
prehistoric claw.

The hooks hit bottom.  They rip up the ocean floor on their way
toward...

The Manta.  One HOOK SCRAPES the length of the sub, leaving claw
marks on the hull while...


INT. MANEUVERING ROOM

Filling the boat with a METAL-ON-METAL HOWL.

                         PAPPY
          Shit of a saint....


INT. CONTROL ROOM

Brice enters fast.  The towel-wrapped Loomis is right behind.

                         LOOMIS
          Hooks!  They're using their hooks!

From above:

                         ODELL
          Lieutenant Brice!  What are your orders?

Brice wavers:  If they can't surface and they can't hide on the
bottom....


EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT

The hooks retreat into the dark, but...

Overhead, the German hull turns hard.

<u>The hooks reappear</u>, bearing down on us again, whiskering right
past CAMERA on their way back to...

The Manta.


INT. CONTROL ROOM

                         LOOMIS
          WHAT ARE YOUR ORDERS, MR. BRICE?


EXT. MANTA - UNDERWATER - NIGHT

One hook snags the periscope sheers...

<u>And rips them away</u>.


INT. CONNING TOWER

<u>Both periscope cylinders buckle</u>.

Seawater rushes in through ruptured gaskets...


INT. CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

...and torrents into the control room.  Bodies start washing down,
Odell among them.


INT. FORWARD CORRIDOR

COLLISION ALARMS.  Claire and Kingsley head for the control room,
but...

Someone slams the airtight door in their faces, locking them out.


INT. CONTROL ROOM

                         LOOMIS
          Who else?  Anyone?  IS EVERYBODY OUT?

Praying so, Odell and some blueshirts fight to get the tower
sealed off.  Brice is still unresponsive, so Loomis, butt naked
now, towel washed away, takes over:  He pushes the helmsman onto
redundant controlls down here:

                         LOOMIS
          Blow ballast!  All ahead flank!

                         HELMSMAN
          Heading, sir?

                         LOOMIS
          Any goddamn heading -- just get us outta

INT. MANEUVERING ROOM

As Pappy jams his levers.


EXT. MANTA - UNDERWATER - NIGHT

Kicking over, the Manta's props churn up clouds of silt.

WIDER as the Manta lifts off the bottom.  The giant hooks return
for the death-stroke...

But this time they miss.  Narrowly.


INT. CONTROL ROOM

The PINGING STARTS FADING, faces start to ease:  Maybe they'll
come out of this alive.  Loomis tracks down Brice.

                         LOOMIS
          Let's hope you do better at the Board of
          Inquiry.

He said it only for Brice -- but when he turns away in disgust, he
notices Odell staring at him.  Brice, too, sees that Odell
overheard.


INT. ENGINE ROOM

Minutes later.  Chief is hustling through the engine room when
Motormac #1 catches him.

                         MOTORMAC #1
          Chief?  Take a look.

CLOSE on the fuel-oil gauges in question:  One shows pressure, the
other level.  The pressure gauge reads below normal.  The level
gauges shows equivalent to "half full" -- 190 tons.

                         MOTORMAC #1
          Look right to you?

Chief studdies the situation -- then smacks the level gauges.  The
needle plummets to 80 tons.


INT. CONTROL ROOM

Bursting in:

                         CHIEF
          We're sloughin' oil.  'Least 10 tons in
          the last 12 hours.

REACTION SHOTS of the still-drenched Brice, Loomis, Odell.  <i>"What</i>
<i>else can go wrong?"</i>


INT. CONTROL ROOM

START on blue-prints being slap-rolled open.  They detail the
Manta's superstructure.

                         CHIEF
          ...somewhere in the port tank.  And if
          it's leaking here or here...it's dumping
          oil into main ballast.  Which means every
          time we surface or dive --

                         LOOMIS
          We leave a goddamn slick.

                         BRICE
          That's how.  That's how they been ridin'
          us.

                         PLANESMAN #1
          This boat <u>is</u> cursed....

He meant to say it under his breath.  But suddenly everyone's
staring at him.

                         PLANESMAN #1
          Figgera speech.

                         COORS
          So how do we fix it?

                         CHIEF
          Only one way.  From the outside-in.

We hear a distant salvo of DEPTH-CHARGES.

                         LOOMIS
          Oh, they'll be linin' up for <u>this</u> job.

                         BRICE
          Odell, make ready some dive gear and pick
          two volunteers...

                         ODELL
          Aye-aye.

                         BRICE
          ...beside yourself.


INT. SHIP'S OFFICE/FORWARD CORRIDOR

                         WEIRD WALLY
          ...so you want someone to free-dive
          outside...into coal-black water...make our
          way <u>below</u> the boat...locate the flood
          ports...slither in <u>between</u> the two
          hulls...

Odell is petitioning volunteers.  Weird Wally, Stumbo, and Hoag
are the dubious prospects.

                         ODELL
          Find the leak and fix it.  That's right.

                         WEIRD WALLY
          ...at night...

                         HOAG
          Hang on.  If we're still submerged, that
          means the main tank's fulla water.

                         WEIRD WALLY
          ...in the dark...

                         ODELL
          Chief thinks with the tower flooded, that
          gives us enough weight to stay down even
          when there's air in the main.

                         WEIRD WALLY
          ...with depth charges and all this
          inexplicable shit happening.


                         ODELL
          Hey, you up to it or not?

                         WEIRD WALLY
          News flash:  "Yeoman Wallace Leads
          Desperate Repair Mission."

Chief appears, lugging dive gear.  He and Odell train their cross-
hairs on Stumbo.

                         STUMBO
          Fuck, no.


INT. FORWARD TORPEDO ROOM

Stumbo.  He's outfitted with goggles, respirator, fins, battle-
lantern.  <i>"How the shit did <u>this</u> happen?"</i>

Odell, Weird Wally, and Stumbo are prepping under the escape
trunk.  Odell notices Coors suiting up nearby.

                         LOOMIS
          I asked him to go.  Buddy system.

Odell accepts without comment.

Working at a back-up sonar station here, Sonar #1 throws a switch:
A steel cylinder drops through the boat, pushing out...


EXT. MANTA SONAR CAVITY - UNDERWATER - NIGHT

A hydrophone.  It deploys beneath the Manta.


INT. FORWARD TORPEDO ROOM

Claire arrives in time to see Odell poised on the ladder beneath
the escape trunk.  Sonar finishes his scan.

                         SONAR #1
          Explosions.  Starboard flank.  Long way
          off, though.

Claire catches Odell's eyes.  <i>"You're going out there with the</i>
<i>depth-charges?"</i>

                         LOOMIS
                    (to divers)
          You're greased.

Odell answers her with a shrug.  <i>"Guess so."</i>


INT. ESCAPE TRUNK

A hatch closes beneath the four men.  The trunk fills with sea
water.

                         WEIRD WALLY
          Hey, when we first get out there?
          Everybody turn off their lights, okay?  Be
          really amazing.

                         COORS
          Belay that, Wallace.

The water hits their chins.  They bite down on mouth-pieces.


EXT. MANTA - UNDERWATER - NIGHT

A deck-hatch opens.  One by one, the four men drift out into near-
perfect dark.

Coors sparks up an underwater torch.  It flares to life,
revealing...

<u>An explosion of stingrays</u>.  Flapping madly, they scramble away
from the light -- but not before they scared the <u>bile</u> out of us.

VERY WIDE:  Leading with the torch, the men crawl head-first down
the side of the sub.  In the distance, DEPTH CHARGES EXPLODE,
backlighting the entire bulk of the sub.  The divers are miniscule
by comparison, mere pilot-fish on a whale's back.


EXT. MANTA FLOOD-PORTS - UNDERWATER - NIGHT

They arrive below.  The sub's flood-ports are here, open to the
sea, and the first three men squeeze through.  For a moment, Odell
is alone outside the sub.  And in that moment...

<u>A presence wells up behind him</u>.

Odell spins.  What was <u>that</u>?  Just another ray?  His lantern
probes black water.  Nothing now.

<u>It grabs his shoulder</u>.

Odell nearly coughs up his mouth-piece, but...

It's only Weird Wally.  Hanging upside-down through the port, he
gives Odell a goggle-eyed look.  <i>"Comin' or not?"</i>


INT. MAIN BALLAST

(NOTE:  A submarine has two hulls -- the pressure hulls on the
inside, a sea hull on the outside.  We're <u>between</u> the hulls now.
It's a place few people, even submariners, have ever seen.)

Surfacing, the men beam lights around to behold...

A curving cathedral of steelwork.  The tank is maybe 10 feet wide
by 20 feet tall by who-knows-how long.  Oil and kelp bob on the
surface of the water.  Dead squid dangle from struts and braces.
<u>Lots</u> of them.

                         STUMBO
          Holy Jamoley....

                         COORS
          Musta sucked up a school of squid, one
          point....

Coors uses a steel mallet to TAP the inner hull...


INT. CONTROL ROOM

...and send a message to the control room.

                         CHIEF
          They're in.

Chief RETURN-KNOCKS.

                         BRICE
                    (to Loomis)
          Standing down for a while.

                         LOOMIS
          Good idea.  Little rack time, feel like a
          champ.

It grates on Brice, but he lets it go.

                         CLAIRE
                    (to Chief)
          How long should it take?

                         CHIEF
          Once they find it?  Pretty straight-
          forward repair.

Claire eyes the hull.  If it's claustrophobic in here, it must be
intolerable in there.

                         CLAIRE
          Easily said, from this side.


INT. MAIN BALLAST

                         COORS
          You guys, forward.  We'll check aft.

Splitting up, Coors and Odell slosh one way, Stumbo and Weird
Wally the other.  Anxious to get this over with, Stumbo heads out
fast.  CAMERA LAGS BEHIND with Weird Wally.

                         WEIRD WALLY
          "Making his way through the chamber,
          redolent with the stench of dead and dying
          calamari...the trailing man realized...
          that it wasn't such a good idea to be the
          trailing man...."

Weirding himself out, Weird Wally hurries to catch up.


INT. SKIPPER'S STATEROOM

Brice sits.  He stares at one particular book on his shelf for a
troubled beat before pulling it down.

It's the patrol log.


INT. FORWARD CORRIDOR

Passing, Claire notices a light on in the skipper's cabin.  She
lays an eye on the curtain-crack to see...

Brice.  He runs a Kurtz-like hand over his skull as he ponders
that blank page of the patrol log:  Portrait of a man who feels
the hounds of Hell gaining on him.


INT. SPLIT SEAM - MAIN BALLAST

The ballast tank finally dead-ends.  Here Stumbo and Weird Wally
find...

A split seam.  FUEL OIL GURGLES through.

Stumbo breaks out wooden wedges. Weird Wally uses a mallet to TAP
A MORSE MESSAGE on the outer hull for...


INT. MAIN BALLAST

Coors and Odell.  They stop and listen.

                         ODELL
          "Found it."  [Should we] head back?

                         COORS
          They found <u>one</u>.

Searching for other ruptures, they press on.


INT. SKIPPER'S STATEROOM

EXTREMELY CLOSE on Brice's fountain pen, writing.  The words don't
come easy.

                         BRICE (V.O.)
          "2330 hours:  We surface to confirm
          sinking of German ship.  Four officers go
          topside -- Commander Winters, myself, Lt.
          Loomis...


INT. MAIN BALLAST

                         BRICE (V.O.)
          ...and Lt. j.g. Steven Coors."

Continuing aft, Coors leads Odell through hip-deep water.  It
seems even <u>darker</u> at this end of the tank.

                         ODELL
          So the night we lost Old Man Winters...

Coors stops.

                         COORS
          Odd time to bring that up.

                         ODELL
          It's an odd place.  How did he bang his
          head?  'Fore he went over?

                         COORS
          You heard.

                         ODELL
          I heard that the boat hit something -- but
          I never felt anything down below.

SOMETHING SPLASHES nearby.  Odell jumps and beams his light on...

A squid's head in the water, one big eye watching him.  Did it
just fall?

Coors studies the back of Odell's head.  As he does, we DROP DOWN
to study the steel mallet in Coors' hand.

Odell turns back.

                         COORS
          Let's keep movin'.


INT. SPLIT SEAM - MAIN BALLAST

Drenched in oil, Stumbo drives wooden wedges into the split.
Weird Wally provides light.  Soon SLOSHING FOOTSTEPS turn them
both around to see...

Absolutely nothing.

                         STUMBO
          What?

                         WEIRD WALLY
          Didn't say anything.

                         STUMBO
          But what were you <u>thinkin'</u>?

                         WEIRD WALLY
          Well, I used to hear about these dock
          workers who got welded up inside these
          kinda places -- and were never heard from
          again.

                         STUMBO
          You are so fucking out of bounds with that
          shit, Wallace.


INT. WATER FALL - MAIN BALLAST

Coors and Odell reach the after terminus and a fall of water.
They point lights up but can't see the source.

                         COORS
          Stern tank, looks likes.

Getting ready to climb, he belts his hammer, slips off fins.

                         COORS
          So anything I say stays here?  This side
          of the hull?
                    (off Odell's nod)
          There <u>were</u> survivors from the sinking.
          Brice and Loomis even started to fish a
          few out.  But Winters had other ideas --
          he ordered Brice to bring a gunnery party
          topside.  Well, three of us had a problem
          with machine-gunning these men right in
          the water -- even if they were Germans.
          There was an argument.  Got kinda heated.

Coors starts climbing a cat's cradle of girders.  The steel is
covered with algae, making the footing difficult.

                         ODELL
          Why didn't you tell us?

                         COORS
          Guess we were trying to protect him, his
          memory.  Felt Winters was a good C.O. --
          even if he could be a tough sonuvabitch,
          sometimes.  For his reputation...his
          family's sake....

Coors finds another seam-split.  Water fans from this one.

                         ODELL
          Okay.  But I still don't understand how he
          hit his head.

                         COORS
          Slippery metal...bad footing....

Coors takes the steel mallet out.  He looks back down at...

Odell way below.  Hard to tell if he's buying it:  He's just
sweeping his light around now -- and not looking up.  It'd be so
easy....

                         COORS
          Accidents happen, right?

Right beside Coors, <u>something moves</u> in the fan of water.  Coors
jars and looks again.  Nothing now.  And just when he decides his
nerves are acting up...

A forms extrudes through the water.  <u>A face</u>.

Coors recoils.

The hammer drops.

Odell looks up as...

The falling hammer smashes into him and his lantern.  Everything
goes dark.  INTERCUT ALL THIS WITH:


EXT. MANTA - FLASHBACKS - NIGHT

QUICK FLASHBACKS:  Of Winters.  His head striking the deck.
Falling overboard.  Hitting the water face-first.


INT. MANTA - SERIES OF ROOMS

A HOWLING SCREAM.

RAPID-FIRE REACTION SHOTS around the boat:  Claire and Kingsley.
Loomis and Chief.  They all know it's coming from between the
hulls.


INT. SKIPPER'S STATEROOM

As Brice's fountain pen blots the page.


INT. SPLIT SEAM - MAIN BALLAST

Weird Wally and Stumbo look toward the DECAYING SCREAM.  A
petrified beat, then...

They bolt.


INT. CONTROL ROOM

Everyone rushes here.  Chief is banging the hull.

                         CHIEF
          Coors!  Sound off!

                         KINGSLEY
          Here?  Or aft?  Where was it?

                         CLAIRE
          Get him out, get him out of there...

                         CHIEF
          Odell!  SOUND OFF!  ODELL!

Brice enters.  He and Loomis touch eyes.


INT. MAIN BALLAST

Lights bouncing wildly, Stumbo and Weird Wally head in the
direction of the scream.  They collide with Odell.

                         STUMBO
          Fuck of God, was that you?

                         ODELL
          Gimme the light, gimme the light, gimme
          the light....

They all move aft now, senses racing, ducking girders and pushing
through squid entrails -- before realizing:  <u>Those aren't squid</u>
<u>entrails</u>.  They lift their lights to find...

Coors.  He's draped over a girder above them.  When he fell, he
must've impacted so hard that he vomited one of his lungs.  It
dangles from his dead mouth like an embryonic sac.

They gape.  <i>"Is this shit even possible?"</i>

                         ODELL
          Get him down....

SLOSHING FOOTSTEPS.  They whirl to see...

Something retreating into shadow.  A human form?  <u>Is there someone</u>
<u>else in here</u>?

Stumbo takes off like a cannon shot.

                         ODELL
          <u>Help me get him down</u>.

Weird Wally spurts after Stumbo.  For one moment Odell is left
alone with a dead Coors...the dangling lung...and the Thing In The
Shadows before...

He dives away, following the other two.


EXT. MANTA FLOOD-PORTS - UNDERWATER - NIGHT

With adrenal speed, Stumbo and Weird Wally shoot out the bottom of
the sub.  Odell appears a beat behind.  Just as he's about to
clear...

<u>Something catches his foot</u>.  Maybe his fin is simply caught on a
barb, but Odell doesn't bother to investigate:  He kicks right out
of his fin and keeps swimming.


INT. FORWARD TORPEDO ROOM

The escape trunk is cracked open.  Three men get dumped inside
with the seawater.  Instantly everyone is TALKING AT THEM.

                         LOOMIS
          Shut up...shut up...WOULD YOU GROW SOME
          DICKS AND SHUT UP!
                    (half-beat)
          Now where is Mr. Od...

Odell rolls onto his back.

                         LOOMIS
          ...Coors.  Where's Coors?

The three men just stare back through goggles, sucking on mouth-
pieces, too amped up to respond.  Soon we grow aware of RANDOM
TAPPING SOUNDS.

                         BRICE
          Tell me that's him.  That's gotta be
          Coors.  He's still alive, right?

                         WEIRD WALLY
                    (locating his
                     voice)
          Sir...that's the one person...I can
          guarantee it's not.

Claire pushes through the crowd to check on Odell.  He indicates
<i>"I'll live."</i>  But Stumbo is still breathing like a plow horse.
Claire tries to take his pulse but gets slapped away hard:  It's
like she touched a burn victim.

                         STUMBO
          <u>Don't touch</u>...don't touch...

                         HOAG
                    (re TAPPING)
          Was that a "b"?  Dit-dot-dot-dot?

                         PAPPY
          I didn't hear a "b".

                         SONAR #1
          Dit-dot.  "A".  Thought I heard an "a".

                         PAPPY
          That's not morse.  Just some shit got
          caught up in the bow planes, now it's
          smacking up against --

                         HOAG
          "C".  Did you hear a "c"?

                         SONAR #1
          Dot-dit-dot-dit.  Definitely a "c".

                         LOOMIS
          Hull sounds.  You guys are gettin'
          lathered up about hull sounds.  Now would
          somebody please tell us what the hell
          happened to Coors?

                         HOAG
          "<u>Back</u>."  B-a-c-k.

                         STUMBO
                    (to himself)
          He's "back"...

                         LOOMIS
          WHERE'D YOU GET THE "K" FROM?

                         KINGSLEY
          Dit-dot-dit.  While you were talking.

                         LOOMIS
          Hey, champ, you can stay out of this.  And
          the rest of you jugheads can --

                         BRICE
          <u>Enough already</u>.
                    (to repair team)
          In the wardroom, one minute.  Keep your
          mouths shut until we debrief.

Brice exits.  The TAPPING FADES AWAY.

                         LOOMIS
          There was no goddamn "k".


INT. OFFICERS' WARDROOM

20 minutes later.  Still a sorry sight, Odell, Stumbo, and Weird
Wally are finishing up with Brice and Loomis.

                         BRICE
          And the fuel leak.  It was repaired prior
          to....

                         STUMBO
          Guess so.  Yeah, sure.  Just about had it
          sewed up when...when...

                         BRICE
                    (to Loomis)
          So if weather's good, we surface tonight,
          run diesels topside while we charge the
          batteries.  Keep pushing for the barn.

                         ODELL
                    (blinking)
          "The barn?"  Our "barn?"

Brice stands and leaves.  Odell follows him right out the door...


INT. FORWARD CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

...and into the forward corridor, where Claire and Kingsley and a
few anxious blueshirts wait.  Suddenly everyone is following Brice
toward the control room.

                         ODELL
          Sir, southern ports of England couldn't be
          more than two days away.  Mr. Kingsley
          here is a navigational officer -- he
          should know the area and --

                         KINGLSEY
          I know all the ports, the depths -- I know
          where the submarine nets are, the mine
          fields....

                         BRICE
          And have the R.A.F. bomb us?  Because they
          mistook us for a hostile boat?


INT. CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Brice ducks the doorway.  With everyone still dogging his heels:

                         KINGSLEY
          There are safety-corridors that we could
          use when --

                         BRICE
          Considered and rejected.  Thank you.

                         ODELL
          Mr. Brice, we've lost both periscopes and
          our main sonar -- we're blind and nearly
          deaf down here.  The men are in a bad way,
          and two of our senior officers are now --

                         BRICE
          Welcome to the war, Odell.

                         CLAIRE
          <u>This has nothing to do with the war</u>.

The procession stops.  Brice turns and glares.  It's one thing for
Odell to challenge Brice -- but not the female.  Not the fucking
Brillo pad and not in front of the crew.

                         CLAIRE
          Just how much longer can we not say what
          we're all thinking?  What, no one wants to
          be the first?  Fine, allow me:  This
          submarine is [haunted] --

Brice snaps up the 1MC and booms his voice around the boat:

                         BRICE
          Now hear this.  The loss of Lieutenant
          Coors is unfortunate but fails to affect
          our plans.  It's daylight now, but I
          expect to surface at 1900 tonight,
          recharge the batteries, then proceed on
          base course back to Connecticut.  That is
          all.

He hooks the mike, steps back to Claire.

                         BRICE
          If you can find the back door on this
          boat, you're free to leave any time.
                    (to Odell)
          And if you can find in the regs where an
          ensign still working on his first can of
          Burma Shave sets the course, I'll gladly
          give you the conn.  Until that time, I'd
          ask that you not say anything that might
          further agitate this crew.  Or me.

Odell opens his mouth to object but...

                         BRICE
          Stay out of my way, Odell.


INT. BATTERY ROOM

CLOSE on a hydrometer filling with battery acid, giving a reading
on specific gravity.  It's turkey-baster technology.

Zap is checking the charge on the batteries.  As he moves on to
the next gang, Chief takes a nervous glance at...

The hydrogen monitor.  The needle is crossing 10% -- the start of
the red zone.


INT. CONTROL ROOM

Brice and Loomis work the chart table, plotting a heading.

                         BRICE
          Not so bad.  Just knock the nose around a
          bit, and we're back on base.  Make it 2-8-
          5.

                         LOOMIS
          Right standard rudder.  Make it 2-8-5,
          true.

                         HELMSMAN
          2-8-5, true.

The helmsman rolls his wheel.

Blowing a sigh, Loomis breaks out his yo-yo and starts doing
tricks.

CLOSE on the gyro-compass charting the course correction:  "270...
280...290..."

Loomis "walks the dog", making his yo-yo bottom out.  He notices
the taut string is leaning to one side of the boat.  Leaning hard.

                         LOOMIS
          You're over-steering, helmsman.

                         HELMSMAN
          Yessir, just getting some...resistance
          from the rudder.

He's struggling with the wheel.  Loomis lends a hand, pulling with
the helmsman.


EXT. MANTA - UNDERWATER - DAY

The rudder.  Hard over.  Not responding.


INT. CONTROL ROOM

CLOSE on the gyro-compass:  "300...310...320..."

Now Planesman #2 joins the tug-of-war.  Jaws clench.  Veins bulge.
The wheel starts shuddering in their hands.

                         BRICE
                    (into 1MC)
          Chief of Boat to control room...Chief of
          Boat to control room...


EXT. MANTA - UNDERWATER - DAY

As the Manta keeps coming about.


INT. CONTROL ROOM

As the vibration in the wheel grows, so does a POUNDING SOUND:
Imagine the noise made by angry Zulu warriors trapped between the
hulls of the sub and trying to break free with sledge hammers.
Then double it.

                         BRICE
          Awright, belay that, BELAY THAT!

Not hearing, the three men hang onto the wheel for another bone-
jarring moment, until...

<u>The rudder wheel shatters</u>.

Bakelite shrapnel sends everybody ducking for cover.

The ZULU HAMMERS DIE.

                         PLANESMAN #1
                    (a beat)
          Nasty shimmy.


EXT. MANTA - UNDERWATER - DAY

Now, smooth as silk, the rudder centers itself.


INT. CONTROL ROOM

                         HELMSMAN
                   (amazed)
          Rudder amidships, sir.

He looks to Brice.  Brice looks to Chief.  Chief, equally
flummoxed, looks to the motormac which entered with him.

                         MOTORMAC #1
                    (unconvincing)
          Some kinda hydraulic failure....

                         CHIEF
          Maybe the I-M-O pump, but never heard
          anything quite like --

                         LOOMIS
          Well, get on it, huh?  Christ, musta
          overshot our heading by....

                         BRICE
          170 degrees.

He's looking at the gyro-compass, which is holding at "95."  We
get the uncanny feeling that the boat just made its <u>own</u> course-
correction.


INT. CREW MESS

CLOSE on an anti-voodoo necklace being made.  Carved-wood icons,
scrimshaw bits, Cracker Jack prizes, and bird feathers are all
strung on a wire by...

Weird Wally.  Other blueshirts are playing cribbage and cards, too
stressed to sleep.  Planesman #1 enters with news.

                         PLANESMAN #1
                    (low)
          Rudder malfunction.  And when we tried to
          shut down the props?  No dice -- wouldn't
          respond.  We're on a runaway boat, fellas.
          Now can anyone top that?

                         HOAG
          Well, I had a strange thought.

                         STUMBO
          Take a number.

                         HOAG
          Yeah, but this one's really...creepshow
          stuff.

Weird Wally perks up.  Others tune in, too.

                         HOAG
          What if...when we took on that Kraut ship
          ...we <u>didn't</u> sink them?  What if...and I'm
          just battin' ideas around here, don't
          nobody get excited...what if they sank <u>us</u>?

                         WEIRD WALLY
                    (a beat)
          Oh, good twist.

                         STUMBO
          I don't get it.

                         HOAG
          Might explain how that dead Kraut talked
          to Stumpie, since, you see...

                         STUMBO
          I don't get it.

                         WEIRD WALLY
                    (getting into it)
          And the controls...they froze up because
          ...they've <u>rusted</u> up...because we're
          actually on the bottom of the ocean.
          Flooded out.

                         HOAG
          'Course, not sure what all that pounding
          was about....

                         WEIRD WALLY
          Rescue divers.  Pounding on the hull.
          Only they're too late.

                         PLANESMAN #1
          So everything we're doing -- playing
          cards, trying to make repairs -- maybe
          it's all happenin' in some kinda....

                         HOAG
          "Slop-world."

                         STUMBO
          Shit.  I get it.

                         WEIRD WALLY
          <u>Very</u> good twist.

                         PAPPY
          Hydrogen...CO2...ozone from the electrical
          shorts -- that's what we're breathin'
          right now, and it's makin' all you guys
          loopier than a roller coaster.  We got
          mechanical problems.  That's all.  So
          what's new?

Everyone falls quiet.  For a beat.

                         WEIRD WALLY
          'Course, we <u>haven't</u> got any radio messages
          lately.

                         PAPPY
          Sweet-and-sour Jesus.  Hand me a pot to
          beat him with.

                         HOAG
          When was the last one?  Before or after
          the sinking?

                         WEIRD WALLY
          Orders to pick up the Brits.

                         PAPPY
          There you go.  <u>After</u>.  Now pinch this shit
          off, wouldja?

That seems to settle it.  For a beat.

                         WEIRD WALLY
          'Less it happened during the depth
          charging.

                         HOAG
          Remember that one?  Rolled right down our
          deck?

<i>"Maybe it <u>wasn't</u> a dud."</i>


INT. CONTROL ROOM

Odell scans the control room:  No other officers here.  He grabs
the map off the chart table and leaves.


INT. CLAIRE'S STATEROOM

A curtain closes.

The map opens, getting pressed to a wall.

A lantern snaps on, illuminating the map and...

                         ODELL
          So exactly how far from England are we?

                         KINGSLEY
          Can I ask why you're asking.

                         ODELL
          No.

                         KINGSLEY
          Right.  What's our heading?

                         ODELL
          Zero-nine-five.

                         KINGSLEY
                    (getting to work)
          Looks like the last star-fix, here...and
          at this latitude, variation 'tween true
          north and magnetic north....

                         CLAIRE
                    (to Odell)
          Looking for a back door, are we?

                         ODELL
          Just in case this boat can't make it home.
          For whatever reason.

                         CHIEF (O.S.)
          ...I-M-O pumps check out.  But the rudder
          has a dedicated line all the way to the
          stern.  If we can tap into that somewhere
          abaft, should regain our steering....

Odell shuts off the lantern.  INTERCUT Odell, Claire, Kingsley
listening in the dimmed cabin as...


INT. FORWARD CORRIDOR

Brice, Loomis, Chief move forward in the boat.

                         BRICE
          Where would you tap in?

                         CHIEF
          After battery room.

                         LOOMIS
          Little dicey, isn't it?  Without venting
          first?

                         CHIEF
          Just threading up new hydraulics.  No
          welding.

                         BRICE
          What are we at, anyway?

                         CHIEF
          13 percent, down in the --

                         LOOMIS
          <u>13 percent hydrogen</u>?

                         BRICE
          Keep your voice down.

                         CHIEF
          Look, I don't know any other way to regain
          control of this boat.  Do you?

A beat.  A decision.

                         BRICE
          Make sure you're sealed off -- don't need
          a repeat of the Hindenburg here.  And
          let's keep this quiet, huh?

                         CHIEF
          You don't want the men to know?

Subtly, Brice checks for listeners -- human or otherwise.

                         BRICE
          Fewer the better.


INT. CLAIRE'S STATEROOM

                         CLAIRE
                    (whispering)
          Like it's a bloody mechanical problem....

The FOOTSTEPS leave.  Odell snaps the lantern back on.  Kingsley
returns to his calcs.

WE TRACK WITH his pencil as it projects a heading across empty
water.  The graphite makes a long, lonely journey eastward until
it reaches...

A tangle of pencil-markings -- jagged course corrections and
torpedo-attack notes.  The Manta has been here before.

                         KINGSLEY
          What is this?  What happened here?

HOLD on Odell's face.  <i>"Oh, shit."</i>


INT. CONTROL ROOM

On their way to make repairs, Chief and Helmsman duck through the
aft doorway, turn back to close the door.  Stumbo and Weird Wally
skim through at the last second, moving forward in the boat.

The AIRTIGHT DOOR CLANGS SHUT.  The lever locks.


INT. GALLEY/CREW MESS - CONTINUOUS

Above the door is a wheel marked "Air to Control Room."  Chief
cranks it closed.

Heading aft, Chief and Helmsman pass the cribbage players...


INT. CREW QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

...continue past 30 sleeping bodies...


INT. ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

...and enter here.  Waiting for them, Pappy and Motormac #1 seal
the doors on either end of the engine room.  Chief notes Pappy's
fish hanging from the pipes.

                         PAPPY
          Guardian angelfish.
                    (explaining)
          Took the second-place team trophy in the
          Army-Navy bowling tournament with that
          fish watching over me.

Not arguing the point, Chief drops through the floor-hatch...


INT. BATTERY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

...and winces when he sees the hydrogen monitor at 15% -- pegged
out at the end of the red zone.  Is it even higher than it shows?
For a moment he considers not doing this.

                         CHIEF
          Awright, we take no chances, make no
          mistakes.  This is the line we wanna tap.
          Rag your tools.


INT. CONTROL ROOM

                         LOOMIS
                    (to Planesman #2)
          Grab some chow.  I'll let you know when
          we're ready to surface.

The planesman peels off.  Loomis fills out watch-sheets as Odell
enters with the map.

                         ODELL
          'Tenant?  A word?

                         LOOMIS
          One sec, champ.  My watches are gettin'
          all --

                         ODELL
          <u>Now</u>, Mr. Loomis.


INT. BATTERY ROOM

CLOSE on a wrench uncoupling a hydraulic line.  The head of the
wrench is wrapped in a rag:  No metal-on-metal contact in this
witches' brew of an atmosphere.

Chief and his team start bleeding the hydraulic rudder line.  As
the dark red fluid bleeds out...

One of those HALF-HUMAN wails is heard.  Not only did it seem to
come from inside the boat, but it sounded positively <u>wounded</u>.

                         MOTORMAC #1
          That is a whale, isn't it?

                         CHIEF
          What else would it be?


INT. CONTROL ROOM

The map is back on the table.  Loomis listens as...

                         ODELL
          ...now maybe it's just a coincidence...I
          know Coors wasn't too sure about his fix
          to begin with...but it sure seems like
          we're going right back to where we sunk
          the German ship.
                    (half-beat)
          Where we lost Winters.

          Hey, Pappy?  "Second-place team trophy in
          the Army-Navy tournament...."  Isn't that
          sorta like "last place?"

Finished threading up the new controls:

                         CHIEF
          Okay.  Let's repressurize the line from
          this point aft -- see if we can't put the
          brakes on this little joyride once and
          for --

The ZULU HAMMERS return.  Lights shut down.

                         PAPPY
          I'll reset the buss.

Pappy hustles forward.  Helmsman grabs for a battle-lantern in the
dark, fumbling it.  When he picks it up, he fails to notice the
shattered lens.  Just as Pappy gets the forward door open...

The aft door opens, too.

                         HOAG
          Hey, Chief?  You know we tripped out
          back --

<u>Both bulkhead doors are open</u>.

                         CHIEF
          Shut that goddamn door before I shut it
          with your goddamn --

The helmsman switches on the broken lantern.

EXTREMELY CLOSE on the carbon filament inside the lantern.
Excited by the hydrogen, it flares like a just-struck match.


INT. CONTROL ROOM

The BOAT SHUDDERS.  Not a lot.  Just enough to be felt but
overlooked as Loomis and Odell start to square off.

                         LOOMIS
          What are you saying, Odell?  It's not a
          coincidence?  Somebody put us on this
          course?

                         ODELL
          Just asking the question.

                         LOOMIS
          Lemme ask one.  Where were you when the
          rudder went over?  Huh?
                    (off Odell's
                     baffled look)
          This course heads back to England -- and
          I've noticed you've had a hard-on for
          anything English.  So where were you,
          Odell?  Back of the boat, messin' with the
          rudder assembly?  Or did you get some
          motormac to do it for --

                         ODELL
          That's so stupid I can't even --

                         LOOMIS
          <u>Not as stupid as what you're thinkin'</u>.
          I'm tired of this hoodoo horseshit.  It's
          not what you think it is.  It's not even
          remotely fucking possible, okay?

Blood spatters the chart:  Loomis hit the table so hard that he
cracked the embedded gyro-compass and cut his fist.  Odell just
stares:  Loomis -- the guy who eats nails for breakfast, the one
guy who seemed iron-clad -- even he's showing cracks.  Odell
breaks the gaze as...

Brice enters.  He grabs a growler and cranks up "Engine Room."
Getting no response, he switches to the 1MC.

                         BRICE
          Engine room, how much longer?

STATIC answers him.


INT. FORWARD CORRIDOR

                         BRICE (O.S./1MC)
          After room, see the Chief in the engine
          room, ask him to respond.
                    (a beat)
          After room?

Sensing something wrong, Claire and Kingsley step out into the
corridor.


INT. CONTROL ROOM

                         BRICE
          Mr. Hoag, report.
                    (a beat)
          Crew quarters, report.
                    (a beat)
          Anybody, pick up your 1MC.

Claire and Kingsley enter and join everyone else in staring at...

The 1MC speaker.  HISSING.

Heart revving, Odell moves to the aft door, looks through the
three-inch porthole, sees only darkness beyond.  He starts to
throw the lever -- and catches himself.

                         ODELL
          It's warm.

Loomis pushes him aside, BANGS metal against the door.  As they
wait for a response....

Anxious REACTION SHOTS:  We tally the faces on <u>this</u> side of the
door -- Brice, Loomis, Odell, Claire, Kingsley, Stumbo, Weird
Wally.  That's it.  Everyone else is on the "warm" side.

                         BRICE
          Break out some lungs.


INT. CREW MESS

Utter blackness.

The bulkhead door cracks open, spreading light into the room,
revealing swirling smoke.  Nothing else moves.


INT. CONTROL ROOM

Loomis and Brice beam battle-lanterns inside, but visibility is
minimal.  Odell is the first to put on a Momsem lung.  Loomis
grabs a second lung.  Claire grabs a third.

                         BRICE
          Two is enough.  Everyone else stays.

                         CLAIRE
          I don't see anyone else here with medical
          training.
                    (off his stony
                     look)
          What're you going to do?  Put me off the
          boat?
                    (to Odell)
          Let's go.

She gets the respirator on.  Behind them all, Weird Wally dons
another anti-voodoo necklace.

                         WEIRD WALLY
          "His intelligence getting the better of
          him, Wallace chose not to lead the mission
          this time...."


INT. GALLEY/CREW MESS

Loomis, Odell, Claire.  They enter and keep low, trying to move
below the densest smoke.  Claire jumps when...

The bulkhead DOOR CLUNKS SHUT behind her.  Brice's face fills the
porthole.

Soon their sweeping lights find...

The first body in the galley.  A steward.

They find a second body.  Then a third and a fourth.  Maybe a
half-dozen casualties here, some playing cribbage even in death.

Claire checks one of the steaming bodies.  The flash-fire passed
through here so fast that it didn't burn -- it seared, it
suffocated.  And bizarrely, it preserved.

The three reach the next bulkhead door, the one leading to crew
quarters.  It's open -- and that gives a sick-in-gut feeling.
Again, Loomis CLANKS METAL futilely.  They step on through...


INT. CREW QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

...and enter a charnel house:  30 more lie dead in here, most
still in their bunks, frozen in time like victims of Pompeii.
Light-beams pick out the grim details:

The hamster still on its wheel...

A roll of Lifesavers still clutched in a smoldering hand...

Photographs of sweethearts, charred but intact, like negative
prints now...

Dog tags fused into someone's chest skin...

An untouched locker, "Fire Equipment Inside."

Stepping over the few men who escaped their bunks, Odell and
Claire continue on.

Lagging behind, Loomis catches movement out of the corner of his
vision.  He whips a light on...

A sooty mirror.  The light reveals his own veiled form.  Under
other circumstances, Loomis might laugh at himself.  But now he
notices that...

<u>His reflection is out of synch with his movements</u>.

Loomis rubs his worried head -- then watches himself do it again
in the mirror.  <i>"What the fuck is going on?  Oxygen deprivation?"</i>

                         ODELL
          Loomis?  'Smatter?

                         LOOMIS
          Change out my scrub....

He motions them on, starts swapping out the vial in his mask that
holds the oxygen-scrubbing chemicals.


INT. ENGINE ROOM

Odell and Claire push open the engine room door and reach Ground
Zero.  There's nothing remotely alive, including...

Pappy's lucky fish.  Boiled alive in its bowl.

Blue light strobes dangerously from an unseen source.  Suspecting
the worst, Odell starts clearing charred bodies from the hatch
area of the battery room.  As he does...

Claire hears a METALLIC SOUND.  Is it tapping?  She moves deeper
into the engine room as...

Odell lowers himself through the hatch...


INT. BATTERY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

...and sees an indoor lightning storm:  The great batteries are
discharging erratically, sending tongues of blue fire licking
across the room.


INT. ENGINE ROOM

The sound Claire hunts becomes a FEEBLE TAPPING.  Her light
finds...

A hand clutching a tool.  The light jumps to a blackened face.
It's <u>Chief</u>, crumpled in a corner, impossibly alive.

                         CLAIRE
          Back here!
                    (to Chief)
          Awright, we found you, we found you...
          how're the legs?  Can you feels your toes?
          Anything at all?

He touches her like a blind man, groping her face, her throat.

                         CHIEF
          Don't try....

                         CLAIRE
          No, no, no, you're going to pull
          through....

                         CHIEF
          Don't try and stop me....

Alarms go off in Claire's head:  Is that rusty-hinge voice really
his?  Is this really the Chief?  She tries to remove his hand from
her throat, but he won't release.

                         CHIEF
          Especially you....

He goes lax.  Only now can Claire pry the hand off her throat, and
as she does...

<u>Another one grabs her shoulder</u>.

                         ODELL
          Clear out.  Now.
                    (no response)
          Batteries are still arcing.  C'mon, Claire
          -- we could be next.

Seeing only the dead Chief here, Odell jerks her away.


INT. CREW QUARTERS

Odell slams the door to the engine room, dogs it, hurries after
Claire.  They shoot past...

Loomis.  He watches them go, then readjusts his mask and steps
back to the sooty mirror.  Somehow it's vital to him -- to his
sanity -- to understand what's going on with the man in the
mirror.


INT. CREW QUARTERS/CREW MESS

Claire and Odell.  Stumbling their way back, light-beams slashing
over steaming corpses, falling and getting back up, disoriented in
the dark, finally reaching the last bulkhead door and wrestling
with the lever until...


INT. CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

It opens.  They collapse into the control room.  Claire's mouth-
piece has long since fallen away, and now she just sits on the
floor wheezing, unable to speak.

                         BRICE
          What happened?  Odell?

                         ODELL
          Somethin'...somethin' kicked off the
          hydrogen and...and they're all...they're
          all....

                         KINGSLEY
          "They're <u>all</u>?"

                         BRICE
          MR. LOOMIS?


INT. CREW QUARTERS

He's testing the sooty mirror:  The strange time-delay is gone
now.  Just to reassure himself, Loomis reaches out to wipe the
mirror clean.

MAN-IN-THE-MIRROR POV:  We're inside the mirror looking out at
Loomis as he clears a swath.  Suddenly his mouth gashes open.
Horror stretches his face.

<u>Winters is staring back at him</u>.


INT. CONTROL ROOM

Brice beams a light through the doorway just as...

<u>Loomis erupts into the control room</u>, bowling Brice over.

                         LOOMIS
          Outta here...outta here...gotta get the
          hell outta here....

                         BRICE
          Loomis!  Get back here!

Stumbo and Weird Wally grab him, trying to calm him.  But Loomis,
bull-strong, tears free and keeps going.  Stumbo winds up with his
Momsem lung.

                         LOOMIS
          WE GOTTA GET OFF THIS BOAT!


INT. FORWARD CORRIDOR

Loomis careens past.  Brice is steps behind.

                         BRICE
          Loomis!  There's nowhere to go!

Loomis ducks into the forward torpedo room.  Just as Brice gets
there...

The DOOR WHUMPS SHUT in his face.  The lever locks.

Brice, Stumbo, Weird Wally grapple with the door, SHOUTING,
SWEARING, fighting to undog it.


INT. FORWARD TORPEDO ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The door opens.  The last six -- Brice, Stumbo, Weird Wally,
Odell, Kingsley, and Claire -- funnel inside to find...

Loomis gone.  There's absolutely no sign of him except for...

His yo-yo.  It swings like a pendulum right below the closed
escape trunk.  The other end is <u>inside</u>.

Brice checks a water-level gauge.  It's topping out.

Stumbo looks at the Momsem lung he still holds.  Loomis'.

                         STUMBO
                    (stunned)
          Did he...even have....

KA-THUNK!  An unseen hatch opens somewhere on the boat.


EXT. MANTA - UNDERWATER - DAY

With CAMERA behind the bridge, we see Loomis rise up out of the
escape hatch -- without a lung.  He tries swimming for the
surface, but that lasts only as long as his one breath of air.
The forward momentum of the boat brings him closer...closer...and
by the time he snags on the mangled periscopes right in front of
us, he's more dead than alive.

There Loomis flutters, a new flag for the Manta.


INT. FORWARD TORPEDO ROOM

Everyone is rooted in shock -- until the boat jolts and the
torpedo room tilts to starboard.  It brings an O.S. THUMPING AND
BANGING.  What <u>now</u>?


INT. FORWARD CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Everyone back-tracks to find...

Clothes, books, photographs -- all of Brice's stuff littering the
corridor.  Was it thrown here when the boat jolted?

BED COILS STRAIN behind the closed curtain of Brice's cabin.  A
DISEMBODIED SIGH follows.  If we didn't know better, we'd swear
someone just went down for a much-needed nap.  Brice doesn't seem
eager to do it, so Odell reaches out with quaking hand to draw
back the curtain.  And just as we get a sliver-glimpse inside...

<u>The lights shut down in the forward section</u>.  The entire boat has
gone dark.  And all anyone sees now is...

The glistening of terrified eyeballs.


EXT. MANTA - UNDERWATER - DAY

As the Manta, listing to starboard, journeys on.

                                                  FADE OUT


INT. CONTROL ROOM

(NOTE:  The remainder of interior scenes will be lit by just gauge
lights and battle-lanterns.)

Odell and Weird Wally are trying to free the air-ballast controls.
They pull on a lever from above while Stumbo, on his back, muscles
the linkage from below.  Claire and Kingsley shed light.

                         ODELL
          Try again.  One, two, three.

                         STUMBO
          C'mon you tight bitch, <u>give</u>....

It won't budge.  Odell slings something across the control room in
frustration.

                         ODELL
          <u>What the hell is wrong here</u>?
                    (a miserable beat)
          If we could blow the main, get to the
          surface...but I don't know how to fix this
          friggin' stuff....

It all hits Odell now -- the confinement, the dark, the deaths.
He points his light down so nobody can see his eyes puddling up.

                         CLAIRE
          Even if you could -- the real problem
          wouldn't be fixed, would it?

                         KINGLSEY
          I think it's time we were told about "Old
          Man Winters."  Everything.

                         ODELL
                    (to Weird Wally,
                     Stumbo)
          Keep trying, huh?

Stumbo grumbles, rattles through a tool box.  Odell pans a light
around.  Brice isn't here.

                         ODELL
                    (low)
          All I know is what Coors told me...that
          Winters wanted to shoot the German
          survivors, shoot them right there in the
          water.  Brice, Loomis, Coors -- they
          wanted to help.  Apparently Winters lost
          the argument.

If a submarine can SHUDDER, that's what the Manta does now,
listing a few more degrees starboard.

                         ODELL
          And I'm just repeating.

                         CLAIRE
          Well, I count two versions of the story.
          How many more do you suppose there are?


INT. GALLEY/CREW MESS

                         ODELL
          Mr. Brice?

Lights probe the burned-out section.  Claire and Kingsley trail
Odell in.  Claire needs a Momsem lung to breathe back here.

                         ODELL
          Lieutenant?

                         KINGSLEY
          Certain he went back here?  <u>Here</u>?

                         BRICE (O.S.)
          Looking for me?

Lights jump to a table, finding Brice seated and working on
something we can't quite see.  Evicted from the forward part of
the boat, he's taken up residence back here with the steaming
dead.

                         ODELL
                    (off-balance)
          Just, uh, reporting that we haven't been
          able to repair the electrical.  Heating's
          down, too.  Ballast levers are inoperable,
          probably jammed during the depth-charging,
          Stumbo's working on it now.  We show 90
          pounds of compressed air left in the 600-
          pound system, and I'm wondering if we
          should save that for when we try and
          surface -- or use it now to breathe.

                         BRICE
          Shinola....

                         ODELL
          Sir?

                         BRICE
          Running out of Shinola, too.

He brings a rag and a shoe above-table.  And now we realize:  In
the dark, on a runaway submarine, the C.O. is waxing his shoes.
It's an attempt to impose normalcy on his life.

                         CLAIRE
          We also came to ask about Commander
          Winters.
                    (a beat)
          If there's anything else you want to tell
          us about that night...something that may
          help us understand...why.

                         ODELL
                    (a beat)
          Sir, do you have any idea why this boat
          seems to be going back to where the
          skipper died?

When he finally looks up, Brice looks at Claire.

                         BRICE
          Don't pretend you don't know.  Just don't
          pretend anymore.

He goes back to his shoes.


INT. CONTROL ROOM

                         KINGSLEY
          Well, wasn't <u>that</u> awkward.

They re-enter the control room, wrapping up in blankets and
jackets as they go.  It's getting numbingly cold in here.
Condensation is icing up on walls.

                         STUMBO (O.S.)
          Maybe Hoag was right...maybe we already
          bought it....

It takes a moment to find Stumbo:  He's curled up on the floor by
the ballast levers, shivering.

                         STUMBO
          If not the depth charge, then the hydrogen
          ...if not the hydrogen, then maybe the
          cold...if not that, then we got Heap Big
          Evil Spirit battin' clean-up.  Too many.
          I mean, shit, there should only be so many
          ways a guy can die.  Ain't fair....

Odell kneels.

                         ODELL
          Stumbo, CO2 hangs low -- it's working its
          way from the floor up.  Gotta stay on
          your feet.

                         STUMBO
          Maybe we're just gonna die over and over
          again....

                         ODELL
          <u>Stumbo</u>.  I need you to keep workin' on the
          ballast controls.  We need them to
          surface, okay?

                         STUMBO
          ...stuck in some vicious "slop-world"
          cycle....

Claire touches Odell's shoulder.  <i>"Let me try."</i>  She kneels and,
with her best bedside manner, smacks him across the face.

                         CLAIRE
          Feel that?

                         STUMBO
          You fucking whore!

                         CLAIRE
          Then you're still alive, aren't you?

Incensed, Stumbo gets up and goes for her.  Odell and Kinglsey
wedge in.

                         KINGSLEY
          Easy, lads....

                         ODELL
          Hey, hey, maybe there's some kinda...
          pulley or wench, or....  Isn't there a
          come-along in the forward room?  Can't we
          use that?

                         STUMBO
                    (still eyeing
                     Claire)
          Yeah, but....

                         KINGSLEY
          Let's go, Stumbo.  We'll do it together.

Kinglsey coaxes Stumbo away.  Odell turns to Claire.

                         ODELL
          So tell me why.  Tell me why these three
          officers would kill their skipper and
          conspire to cover it up.  That's what
          you're thinking, isn't it?

                         CLAIRE
          If I am, I see I'm not alone.

                         ODELL
          Loomis was up for a major citation, okay?
          Brice was in line for his own command,
          Annapolis, naval family...Coors had this
          Irish girl up in Boston, they were talkin'
          about....  <u>These guys had everything to</u>
          <u>live for</u>, Claire.

                         CLAIRE
          By that thinking, had everything to lose,
          too.

                         ODELL
          "Why."  I haven't head "why."

She shakes her head and looks back in Brice's direction.

                         CLAIRE
          "Don't pretend you don't know."  What the
          hell could he have....
                    (a beat)
          Are we missing somebody?

Their lights sweep.

                         ODELL
          Wallace?
                    (into 1MC)
          Wallace, sound off.

The only answer is CREEPY SILENCE.  Now they notice...

Light coming from the ship's office.

Odell and Claire ease closer to find...


INT. SHIP'S OFFICE/CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Weird Wally.  He's sitting in his chair, head dipped, open pulp in
his lap.

                         ODELL
          Wallace?

Still no answer.  We get an itchy feeling this is one of those he-
looks-alive-but-he's-really-dead moments.  Odell reaches out to
touched Weird Wally...

<u>And he jumps in his chair</u>.

Odell and Claire jump in their skins.

Weird Wally removes headphones that he's using as earmuffs.  His
chest bristles with amulets and totems, his tiny office is adangle
with charms and talismans.  All that's missing is the
"Voodooville" sign.

                         WEIRD WALLY
          I am trying to read here.

                         ODELL
          Look, running out of plays in the
          playbook.  If you have any ideas on how to
          get control of this boat....

                         WEIRD WALLY
          "They scoffed at him...tried to silence
          him...yet in their most dire hour, they
          turned to Wallace for understanding...."
                    (indicating a
                     stack of pulps)
          I've been checking the literature on the
          subject, and the thing we know about
          maledictions is --

                         CLAIRE
          "Maledictions?"

                         WEIRD WALLY
          Look it up.  "Maledictions" don't issue
          from heaven or hell, but some unresolved
          place in between.
                    (flipping pages)
          In fact, there's a great description of it
          in "The Natives of Netherworld," a novella
          by Pierce Milestone which opens in --

                         ODELL
          Wallace?  We're running out of air.

                         WEIRD WALLY
          Suffice to say, the malediction needs
          satisfaction in order to escape its
          netherworld.

                         ODELL
          And if you had to guess what would satisfy
          <u>our</u> "malediction"....

                         WEIRD WALLY
          I thought it was obvious.
                    (off their blank
                     faces)
          Old Man Winters never got a chance to go
          down with his ship.  Did he?

Looks.  <i>"He's taking us back to sink us?"</i>  Without warning, Claire
slides bonelessly down the wall, hand to her chest.  Odell knows
what it is:  The canary in their coal mine just fell off its
perch.

                         ODELL
          Okay, okay, I'm gonna take care of it
          right now.

                         CLAIRE
          <u>Don't</u>....

                         ODELL
          Just bleed a little air into the control
          room, just enough to --

                         CLAIRE
          Need it to surface...said so yourself....

                         ODELL
          I don't know <u>how</u> much we need.  But we'll
          die down here if we don't do something
          soon.  And you'll be the first, Claire.

                         CLAIRE
          Just let me...please, let me have....

She sucks on her Momsem lung.  Odell's lantern dims.  He tries to
smack it back to life, but it dies in his hands.  It's all going
wrong.  Everything.

                         ODELL
                    (to Weird Wally)
          Keep watch.  If she gets any worse, find
          me.

He touches her head gently, wishing he had magical healing powers,
then leaves to find more light.

Weird Wally hitches closer to Claire.  She notes the tangle of
religious artifacts on his chest.  Trying gamely to sound better:

                         CLAIRE
          [I] gather you're religious....

He fingers a Star of David, a Muslim Crescent, a fat-bellied
Buddha -- and a Latin cross -- before shaking his head.

                         WEIRD WALLY
          Just in case <u>he</u> is.

Almost smiling, Claire lets here eyes drift closed.

MEMORY HIT:  Of another cross.  The one scribbled in the patrol
log.

Her eyes snap back open.  <u>Now</u> it means something to her.


INT. FORWARD CORRIDOR

Darkness.

Alone, Claire steps into the corridor set at a drunken angle.  She
takes a hit of air from her lung -- and that's it, no more.  Now
she just listens.  Soon a WET, METHODIC BREATHING becomes audible.
It's the kind of sound a submarine might make on its own -- but
it's also the sound a drowning victim might make if he returned
from the dead.  Claire flicks off her lantern and aims it ahead
at...

The skipper's cabin.  Is "he" asleep?

Steeling herself, Claire approaches...


INT. SKIPPER'S STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS

...and eases the curtain open.  The BREATHING IS LOUDER here.  Her
light checks the bunk.  Empty.  <i>"Well, what did I expect?"</i>  The
light flits to the desk -- and finds the patrol log.

Claire moves inside and opens the log.  There it is again -- the
cross.  Apparently it means something to Brice, too.  Claire finds
his latest entry and reads.

                         BRICE (V.O.)
          2230:  Sight target believed to be German
          cruiser.  Winters orders flank speed to
          close target and gain a firing angle...


INT. CONNING TOWER - FLASHBACKS

We see QUICK VISUALS to support the voice-over:  The men in the
tower working fast and feverish.  Taking periscope glimpses.
Scribbling on charts.  Feeding data into the TDC.

                         BRICE (V.O.)
          2315:  Loomis checks target profile
          against I.D. log, matching it to Berlin
          class.  I personally verify match.

We see Loomis and Brice consulting a ship I.D. log, concurring on
a silhouette.

                         BRICE (V.O.)
          2320:  Single torpedo fired from #4 tube.
          Heard the strike, followed by collapsing
          bulkheads.

We see Coors smacking the "fire" button.  A stop-watch running.
Tense faces waiting.  Soon the MUFFLED STRIKE.

                         BRICE (V.O.)
          2330:  We surface to confirm sinking.
          Four officers go topside -- Commander
          Winters, myself, Lt. Loomis, and Lt. j.g.
          Steven Coors....

We seen an overhead HATCH CRACKING open.  On that sound, we CUT
BACK to...


INT. SKIPPER'S STATEROOM

An INKWELL BREAKING on the floor.  <u>Claire just knocked it off the</u>
<u>desk</u>.  Her breathing stops just as...

The <u>other</u> BREATHING STOPS.  BED COILS GROAN.  Dreading it, Claire
puts her light on...

The bunk.  Motionless.  But the bedcovers have moved.  Haven't
they?

After a small forever, the other BREATHING RESUMES.  Claire takes
the patrol log and backs out of the room.


INT. OFFICERS' WARDROOM

RAPID-FIRE SHOTS of Claire's hands opening two books, rifling
through page after page of ship silhouettes.  Her fingers tremble
from cold <u>and</u> fright, but they manage to tear out two pages.

Behind the drawn curtain of the wardroom, Claire overlays the two
pages and puts a light behind them.  The two silhouettes line up
almost perfectly.

Her mind reels.

Now we see the books she's torn from:  One is the "AXIS
IDENTIFICATION LOG."  The other, "ALLIED IDENTIFICATION LOG."

Claire makes a move to leave but...

The BUNK SQUEAKS across the corridor.  HEAVY FEET hit the floor.

Nap time's over.

Now she hears a CURTAIN OPENING and FOOTSTEPS THUMPING out.  The
fabric of Claire's curtain ripples as something passes on the
other side.  Then it's gone.  Just as Claire's heart starts up
again, the <u>FOOTSTEPS DOUBLE BACK to her</u>.

CLOSE on the curtain-rings.  Starting to move.

Claire backs into a dark corner and shuts off her light as...

The curtain opens.  <u>He's standing right there</u>.

                         ODELL
          Claire?  What're you doing in here?


INT. CONTROL ROOM

Stumbo and Kingsley have retrieved the come-along wench.  They
start hooking chains into the frozen ballast controls.


INT. OFFICERS' WARDROOM

START on the two ship silhouettes, overlapped and backlit.  Claire
is showing Odell the similarity.  Wasting as little breath as
possible:

                         CLAIRE
          German cruiser, Berlin class...type Brice
          said you sunk...and my ship...Fort James.

We can almost see Odell's brain trying to catch up to his eyes and
ears.

                         ODELL
          Are you telling me...that the German
          submarine Kingsley saw....

                         CLAIRE
          Wasn't.

Time stands still.

                         ODELL
          But it <u>was</u> an accident.

                         CLAIRE
          Not leaving us in the water to die.  They
          had to hear the calls for help.  In
          English.

                         ODELL
          And you think that Winters would actually
          just....  Or do you think that he wanted
          to pick up survivors...and that maybe it
          was...

                         CLAIRE
          Who mis-i.d.'d the ship?  Who had
          everything to lose?


INT. CREW HEAD

As Brice just shaves in the dark.


EXT. MANTA - UNDERWATER - NIGHT

As the Manta's props shut down.


INT. CONTROL ROOM

An UNNERVING QUIET overtakes the boat.  Stumbo puts a light on the
telegraphs:  Both show "STANDARD" speed.  The boat should be
moving -- but it's not.

CLOSE on the bathy-thermograph:  The stylus has bottomed out.
It's like it just dropped dead.

Kingsley sweeps an arm across the chart table for a clear view of
the map.  A coffee cup gets knocked over and...

A <u>block</u> of ice-coffee tumbles out.  <u>That's</u> how cold it is now.

Odell and Claire enter.

                         STUMBO
          Either batteries finally crapped out,
          or....

                         WEIRD WALLY
          Or we're here.

                         ODELL
          Let's use that air!

They attack the come-along, cranking the handle, taking up slack
in the chains.  As they do...


EXT. MANTA - UNDERWATER - NIGHT

The Manta starts going nose-down.  The depth-charge rolls off the
deck.


INT. CONTROL ROOM

<u>The control room tilts forward</u>.  Anything not bolted down starts
moving.  Sliding.  Tumbling.  Including...

Claire.  Odell grabs her.

                         STUMBO
          Oh, fuck me, this is it!

                         WEIRD WALLY
          I hate being right.

                         ODELL
          Keep cranking, keep cranking!

The chains go taut, but the ballast levers still resist.  We can
actually hear METAL LINKS STRETCHING.  Suddenly...

<u>The main ballast lever collapses</u>, snapping off...

...tomahawking across the control room...

...and smashing gauges next to Stumbo.  It could've been his head.
But did that do it?  Did the lever throw before it snapped?  HULL-
CRACKING SOUNDS as the outside pressure changes.

                         STUMBO
          Goin' down!  He's gonna take us all down!

Odell lurches to the depth gauge, still hanging by its wires.  The
needle is dropping.

                         ODELL
          No.  No, no, no....

<u>The gauge is hanging upside-down</u>.  He rights it -- and sees the
needle rising.

                         ODELL
          It's working.


EXT. MANTA - UNDERWATER - NIGHT

As the Manta spirals ass-first toward the surface.


INT. CONTROL ROOM

                         STUMBO
          JUST LIKE I SAID!  WE'RE RISING, WE'RE
          RISING!


INT. CREW HEAD

JAGS OF RELIEF from the O.S. control room.  Brice hears the ruckus
-- and just towels off his baby-smooth face.


EXT. MANTA - RAIN SQUALLS - NIGHT

Props first, the Manta erupts out of the ocean.


INT. CONTROL ROOM

Everyone holds on tight as the control room rocks back, leveling
off.


INT. CREW HEAD

Brice is buttoning up a fresh shirt when the boat levels.
Something slides off a shelf, and he catches it just before it
hits the floor.

It's the pistol.


INT. CONTROL ROOM

The BOAT GOES QUIET again.  The depth gauge is zeroed out.  Odell
instinctively waits for orders -- then realizes.

                         ODELL
          All right.  Okay.  We do this fast.
          Stumbo, see if we can drain the tower.  If
          we can't get out that way, we use the
          forward trunk.  Wallace, see about raising
          the radio mast for a distress call.

Stumbo and Odell attack the tower hatch.  Weird Wally starts for
the radio shack, but notices...

The radar screen hazing to life.

                         WEIRD WALLY
          Hey....
                    (no one hears)
          Hey, guys....
                    (no one hears)
          We have contact on SJ radar!  4,000 yards
          starboard bow!

<u>There's a blip closing on them</u>.


EXT. MANTA - RAIN SQUALLS - NIGHT

As the radar antenna sweeps.


INT. CONTROL ROOM

Crowding the radar screen:

                         ODELL
          Lemme see, lemme see....

                         STUMBO
          Same contact?  Same German cruiser?

                         KINGSLEY
          If we're back in the shipping lanes, could
          be a merchantman.  Could be British.

It's impossible to tell.

                         ODELL
          Wallace, raise the mast, issue a radio
          challenge on the RAL-6.  Get that ship to
          i.d. itself before....

He stops himself, seeing...

Shined shoes.  Crisp khakis.  Perfect Windsor knot in a black tie.
And the pistol, holstered.

                         BRICE
          Well done, Mr. Odell.  But I'm feeling
          much better now.

A beat.  No one speaks.

                         BRICE
          You were saying?

                         ODELL
          We have a contact.  And maybe an
          opportunity.

                         BRICE
          "An opportunity...."

                         ODELL
          To abandon ship.

Brice frowns at the radar screen.

                         BRICE
          I don't know that's a friendly out there.
          Just because you hope it is, doesn't make
          it so.  And if it is a hostile --

                         ODELL
          I think it's better to scuttle and take
          our chances with a surface vessel, any
          surface vessel, rather than --

                         BRICE
          And tell Connecticut what?  Hmmm?  That we
          scuttled a fleet submarine because we lost
          a few men carrying out our mission?

                         STUMBO
          "Few men?"  Lieutenant....

                         BRICE
          That we panicked?  Lost our heads?  Hmmm?
          That a handful of people disagreed with
          their superior officer, ignored the chain-
          of-command, and took matters into their
          own...their own hands....

He stops himself.  Claire and Odell touch eyes.  <i>"Did he just come</i>
<i>close to confessing?"</i>

                         CLAIRE
          We have a chance, maybe one, to get off
          this sewer pipe you call a "boat," and we
          need to take it.  Now.

                         BRICE
          We'll wait right here.

He unholsters the pistol.  An electrified beat.

                         WEIRD WALLY
          Seeing as how there's a lull in the
          conversation...contact at 2,500 yards.
          Might cross astern.

                         ODELL
          Mr. Wallace.  No matter what Mr. Brice
          says, I want you to go to the radio shack
          and establish voice contact with that --

                         BRICE
          Belay that, Wallace!  You are <u>not</u> the
          skipper here, Mr. Odell!

                         ODELL
          And neither are you, sir!

Brice cracks his mouth with the pistol.  Odell goes down like
lead.  Brice walks over him, pivots to the radio shack...


INT. RADIO SHACK - CONTINUOUS

...and BLOWS THE SHIT out of the radio gear.


INT. CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Brice reloads.  Consults the radar screen.  Sees the blip at 2,000
yards.  Hears A SHIMMERING SOUND on the hull.

                         BRICE
          Rain squall.  Little luck, he won't see us
          in all this [weather]....

He sees one light toggle red on the "Christmas tree."  One hatch
just opened somewhere on the boat.

Brice does a quick head-count.  All the men are here.  All the
<u>men</u>.


EXT. MANTA - RAIN SQUALL - NIGHT

The forward escape hatch is open.  CAMERA SWINGS UP to find...

Claire.  Lying on the deck.  Taking deep life-renewing breaths.
Spending a few precious seconds before getting up and making her
way aft in the downpour.  Praying she's in time for...

The ship.  Is that it?  Those lights?

Claire sweeps a battle-lantern back and forth, YELLING HERSELF
HOARSE, stopping only when...

Gun metal touches her neck.

                         BRICE
          It's really not safe up here, Miss Paige.


INT. CONTROL ROOM

CLOSE on the radar.  Odell's mouth-blood is pattering the screen.
The blip is at 1,200 yards.

                         ODELL
          Stumpie, Wallace, with me.

They grab lanterns and charge aft.


EXT. MANTA - RAIN SQUALLS - NIGHT

Topside, Claire hasn't moved.  She just keeps her eyes -- and
lantern -- trained on the coming lights.

                         BRICE
          We're going below now.

Still she doesn't move.  Brice grabs her by the scruff and tosses
her forward, sending the lantern skittering away.  Claire steadies
herself on cabling.

                         CLAIRE
          Bury everybody and bury the truth!  Is
          that it, Brice?

                         BRICE
          Time to go.

Claire moves right back to him -- and lets the pistol touch the
front of her neck.

                         CLAIRE
          Like this.  This is how I go.

Brice tries to back up and get separation.  She matches him step
for step in a danse macabre, clutching his gun hand now, keeping
the pistol to her own throat.

                         CLAIRE
          If that's your plan, get on with it.
          Because I am done being scared.
                    (a beat)
          GET ON WITH IT, YOU FUCKING COWARD!


INT. AFT TORPEDO ROOM

CLOSE on keys being torn off a dead man's neck.

CLOSE on a key opening the armory locker.  Weapons and munitions
tumble to the floor.  One box is stenciled "M-55 SIGNAL
PROJECTILES."

                         ODELL
          Know how these work?

                         STUMBO
          Mortar tubes in both torpedo rooms, but
          I've never --

                         ODELL
          Try.

Odell grabs a semi-auto rifle and arrows away.


INT. CONTROL ROOM

On his own now, Odell races back through the control room,
passing...

                         KINGSLEY
                    (reading radar)
          800 yards!  It'll be a close shave!


EXT. MANTA - RAIN SQUALLS - NIGHT

Brice twists free of Claire's grasp.  He always did have trouble
meeting her eyes, and when he looks away now, he finds himself
staring at...

Loomis.  Still hanging from the gnarled periscopes.

                         BRICE
                    (parroting Loomis)
          "Just leave."  "They'll blame it on a U-
          boat."  "Just get outta here and they'll
          never fucking know...CHAMP!"

He PUMPS A FEW ROUNDS into Loomis' corpse.  It's misplaced rage,
and Brice realizes it.  Now it all drains out of him.  He slumps
against the deck gun.

                         BRICE
          Kept looking for some way...to take it
          back...make it end right...some way
          without dishonoring Winters, but...I was
          going to wear this uniform back to port
          and now [it's ruined]....
                    (wretchedly)
          What should I do, Miss Paige?

Claire doesn't need to look at the ship anymore:  She can hear the
BIG DIESELS bearing down.

                         CLAIRE
          You let me have the light.  You let me
          signal for help.

Brice shakes his head.  <i>"I don't know...I just don't know...."</i>

                         CLAIRE
          That's the right ending.

On the other side of the tower, Odell claws his way topside.  He
takes a precious second to check the load on his weapon.

Brice picks up the lantern.  Checks to make sure it's still
working.  Thinks.  Walks it back to Claire as if there were all
the time in the world.

Odell arrives in time to catch...

Claire and Brice facing off.  Behind them is a moving, THUNDERING
WALL of steel:  <u>The ship is passing the Manta right fucking now</u>.

Claire has her hands out for the lantern:  <i>"Please...."</i>

                         BRICE
          Finally figured out why he didn't kill me,
          too....
                    (like it's the
                     secret of life)
          He didn't have to.

Brice slings the lantern overboard...

                         CLAIRE
          NO!

...and EMPTIES THE CLIP into his brain.

Odell.  Shocked senseless.

Claire.  Spiraling away but looking back to see...

Brice.  Staring at her as he falls overboard.  The last thing we
saw on his face wasn't pain.  It was relief.

The ship.  Stern sweeping into view.  On its rear deck...

A British flag.

Claire.  SCREAMING HER ANGUISH.  Realizing the ship never saw the
Manta.  Realizing it's...

Vanishing.  Being swallowed by the rain.

Odell charges aft, FIRING HIS WEAPON as he runs, waving his light,
trying anything to get the ship's attention.

It powers past, oblivious.

Claire slumps against a deck-pipe.

                         CLAIRE
          Dear God, it didn't see us....

<u>White-hot FLAME HISSES out of the deck-pipe</u>...

...snakes up into the night sky...

...and DETONATES.  Red light illuminates...

The British ship.  Almost out of range.  But visible for another
moment or two.

Odell gives a FRENZIED WAR CRY and stomps the deck, trying to be
heard in the torpedo room underfoot.

                         ODELL
          Again, Stumbo!  Again!


INT. AFT TORPEDO ROOM

As Stumbo rams another M-55 into the mortar tube.


EXT. MANTA - RAIN SQUALLS - NIGHT

A second FLARE HISSES out of the deck-pipe...

And BLOWS overhead.

The ship.  Still there.  Barely.

A third flare launches and BLOWS.  As its light fades, it's
replaced in the sky by...

A YELLOW FLARE suspended by a parachute.  <u>It came from the British</u>
<u>ship</u>.

Suddenly standing in a world of golden rain, Claire laughs and
cries and loses her footing.  Odell catches her before she hits
the deck -- and sees no reason to let go.

Weird Wally and Kingsley appear, armed and primed for action.  But
they uncoil when they see...

No Brice.  Just Odell and Claire holding each other.

Stumbo stumbles topside.

                         ODELL
          They saw.  British freighter.  They saw
          and they acknowledged.

All five survivors huddle together, steadying one another, forming
a human atoll on the rolling deck of the Manta.  Claire finds
herself arms-locked with Stumbo.  In his face we see grudging
respect.

                         STUMBO
          Weren't the first woman that ever slapped
          me -- and won't be the last.  But well
          done, Miss Paige.

                         CLAIRE
          Well done, Mr. Stumbo.

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. BRITISH SHIP - PRE-DAWN/DAWN

The rain is easing.  Morning is a promise on the horizon.

Claire, Kingsley, Stumbo, and Weird Wally are being tended to on
the deck of the rescue ship, hot liquids and blankets dispensed.

Removed from the others, Odell is joined by...

                         BRITISH CAPTAIN
          Thought I'd turn the 4-inch guns on your
          boat, help you scuttle her.  But looks
          like someone beat me to it.

He motions to...

The Manta.  100 yards off, it's starting to bubble under.

Odell nods vacantly.  <i>"Looks that way."</i>  The British captain
leaves as Claire approaches.  She watches side-by-side with Odell
as sunlight breaks over the Manta.  Its stern is rising for the
last time.

                         ODELL
          So what would <u>you</u> say?  If you were the
          one who had to go back and explain it all?

                         CLAIRE
                    (feeling sunlight
                     on her face)
          Seems unlikely, doesn't it?  Now.

                         ODELL
          Have you considered it?  That maybe when
          Winters died, he just died?  Period?  And
          the rest of it...I mean, the kind of air
          we were breathing...does things to your
          brain.

                         CLAIRE
          You say what you have to say, ensign.  But
          I'll always know what happened down there.

Off their shared look, CUT TO:


EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

Nose first, the Manta does a downward death-spiral.  It leads us
to...

A shipwreck, perched on an undersea ledge.  HOLD here as the Manta
continues into the depths.  The shipwreck is a torpedo-ripped hulk
-- yet we can still make out the white cross painted on its flank.
This was a hospital ship.  This was the Fort James.

                                                  FADE OUT
