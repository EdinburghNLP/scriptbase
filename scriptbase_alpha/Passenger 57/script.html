</p><p></p><p id="act">Handsome.  Capable-looking.  Sharp, chiseled features. But it's the eyes that grab you.  They're the coldest, crudest eyes you've ever seen and they belong to CHARLES RANE, known in the terrorism trade as "Wolfgang."  On the Interpol Hit Parade, Wolfgang is number one with a bullet.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DR. BAUMAN (O.S.)
</p><p id="dia">Close, please.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Wolfgang closes his eyes.  A felt-tip pen ENTERS FRAME and begins to make precise marks on Wolfgang's features. These are the marks of a skilled plastic surgeon, mapping out the operation he intends to perform.  Everything about Wolfgang's face will change.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DR. BAUMAN (O.S.)
</p><p id="dia">Open.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Wolfgang opens his eyes.  No amount of surgery can change them.  They remain cold, cruel and penetrating.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DR. BAUMAN (O.S.)
</p><p id="dia">Well?
</p><p></p><p id="act">A mirror ENTERS FRAME.  Wolfgang smiles at his marked-up image, eyes gleaming with wicked pleasure.  This is one scary guy.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">WOLFGANG
</p><p id="dia">I think I'm going to like the new me.
</p><p></p><p id="right">CUT TO:
</p><p></p><p id="slug">2      INT. SURGERY                                             2
</p><p></p><p id="act">Darkness.  Then -- BOOM! --a big overhead light comes on, illuminating Wolfgang who reclines in a custom operating chair surrounded by gleaming high-tech equipment and a surgical team headed by DR. MICHAEL BAUMAN, the Florida Gulf coast's foremost plastic surgeon.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Dr. Bauman looks at the wall clock.  Two minutes 'til noon.  Bauman wipes some sweat from his lip and adjusts his surgical mask.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BAUMAN 
</p><p id="dia">Sedate the patient.
</p><p></p><p id="act">An enter TANK HISSES to life.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">3      EXT. CLINIC GROUNDS - DAY                                3
</p><p></p><p id="act">Bauman's beautiful hacienda-style hospital is located high in the Palisades overlooking the ocean.  Without noise or fanfare, three SWAT vans arrive ON the SCENE.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">4      SURGERY                                                  4
</p><p></p><p id="act">A nurse prepares to place the ether mask over Wolfgang's nose and mouth.  But the patient has other ideas. Wolfgang reaches up and catches the nurse by the wrist.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">WOLFGANG 
</p><p id="spkdir">(politely)
</p><p id="dia">That won't be necessary.  I intend to stay awake.
</p><p></p><p id="act">The surgical team reacts with shocked surprise.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">5      INT. CORRIDOR                                            5
</p><p></p><p id="act">SWAT commandos are on their way, moving with swift, military precision -- each commando armed with the latest in high-tech weaponry.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">6      SURGERY                                                  6 
</p><p></p><p id="act">Bauman is flustered by Wolfgang's refusal to be sedated.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BAUMAN 
</p><p id="dia">You don't understand.  The work I have to do -- the pain involved --
</p><p></p><p id="act">Pain is Wolfgang's favorite word.  He smiles his Death's Head smile.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">WOLFGANG 
</p><p id="dia">Pain is something I've learned to live with.
</p><p></p><p id="act">It's all there in Wolfgang's eyes.  Not just pain but the <u>pleasure</u> of pain.  Wolfgang can't <u>wait</u> for Bauman to cut into him!  Bauman realizes he's dealing with one weird motherfucker and wisely decides to humor him.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BAUMAN 
</p><p id="dia">All right.  Let's proceed.
</p><p></p><p id="act">A scrub nurse presents an operating tray to Bauman.  On it are an assortment of strange scalpels and instruments. Bauman shoots a nervous look at the clock -- thirty seconds 'til noon -- and selects a wicked-looking scalpel.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">7      CORRIDOR                                                 7
</p><p></p><p id="act">SWAT commandos converge on the door marked "Surgery."
</p><p></p><p id="slug">8      SURGERY                                                  8
</p><p></p><p id="act">Bauman bends over Wolfgang.  He brings up the scalpel, his hand shaking ever so slightly.  A drop of sweat falls from Bauman's forehead and lands on Wolfgang's lower lip.  Wolfgang's tongue darts out and licks it away.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Bauman and Wolfgang lock eyes.  Wolfgang knows that Bauman has set him up.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">WOLFGANG 
</p><p id="dia">The patient lived.  But I'm afraid we lost the doctor.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Wolfgang's hand darts up like a cobra, grabs the scalpel and thrusts it into Bauman's neck.  Bauman screams and staggers back, spraying blood.  The surgical team recoils in horror.
</p><p></p><p id="act">At that moment, the door is kicked open by SWAT.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">SWAT COMMANDER 
</p><p id="dia">Freeze!
</p><p></p><p id="act">Wolfgang is already on his feet.  He takes two long strides, dives through the air and CRASHES through a wall of smoked GLASS.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">8A     ADJOINING ROOM                                           8A
</p><p></p><p id="act">Wolfgang hits the floor in a shower of glass, scrambles to his feet and bursts through a door, knocking over a nurse.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">8B     INT. CORRIDOR                                            8B
</p><p></p><p id="act">Terrified patients and staff flatten themselves against the walls as Wolfgang comes charging down the corridor, half-naked, surgical gown flapping behind him, pursued by a wave of SWAT commandos.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">9 thru 11      OMITTED
</p><p></p><p id="slug">12     ANGLE                                                    12
</p><p></p><p id="act">Wolfgang rounds the bend.  At the end of the corridor is an elevator -- its doors have begun to separate.  It's Wolfgang's only chance.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Wolfgang races for the elevator, bare feet slapping marble.  He's halfway there when the elevator doors slide open to reveal a second team of SWAT cops.  They spill out with weapons drawn, ready to open fire.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Wolfgang puts on the brakes.  The first SWAT team arrives from behind and Wolfgang is caught in the middle.  One false move and he gets fragged from both directions.  Oh, well.  With a shrug of indifference, Wolfgang raises his hands over his head.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">SWAT OFFICER 
</p><p id="dia">You're under arrest!
</p><p></p><p id="act">The smile on Wolfgang's face seems to say, "Temporarily." Wolfgang begins to whistle "Pack Up Your Troubles" as SWAT cops rush forward to cuff him.

</p><p></p><p id="slug">13     EXT. NIGHT SKY                                           13
</p><p></p><p id="act">Fierce RAIN.  Dense clouds.  First the awsome ROAR, then we see the massive underbelly of a 707 airliner as it lumbers ACROSS FRAME.  Clouds thicken.  The big ENGINES work hard against the storm.  Suddenly, an EXPLOSION rips out the bulk cargo door and the airliner hurtles to earth -- on fire and out of control -- a symphony of WIND and noise.
</p><p></p><p id="right">CUT TO:
</p><p></p><p id="slug">13A    INT. BEDROOM (LOS ANGELES) - NIGHT                       13A
</p><p></p><p id="act">JOHN CUTTER sits upright in bed, jolted from the nightmare.  His eyes are wide with fear.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CUTTER
</p><p id="dia">Lisa...
</p><p></p><p id="act">Cutter's naked chest is soaked with sweat and his heart is pounding like a jackhammer.  The annoying sound in his ears is the BUZZ OF his ALARM CLOCK.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Cutter SHUTS OFF the ALARM.  6 A.M.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Cutter looks around.  Nothing to worry about.  He's alone in his own bedroom, bathed in the blue glow of a TV test pattern.  Cutter runs a hand through his damp hair.  He's a black man in his late 20s -- handsome and muscular --but unable to shake the nightmare that has haunted him for two years.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CUTTER 
</p><p id="spkdir">(under his breath)
</p><p id="dia">I gotta get some new dreams.
</p><p></p><p id="act">ANGLE WIDENS.
</p><p></p><p id="act">The room is pretty much bare.  Bed, nightstand and a Solo-flex exercise set-up.  Cutter is a man of few possessions.  The walls are covered with a variety of bulls-eyes and target silhouettes -- the kind used by law enforcement.  Each one is expensively framed -- Cutter's idea of art.
</p><p></p><p id="act">The ALARM GOES OFF AGAIN.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CUTTER 
</p><p id="dia">I heard you the first time.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Cutter SHUTS OFF the ALARM and climbs out of bed.  He goes to the Solo-flex and begins a rigorous workout --pumping iron to keep the chaos inside him at bay.  As Cutter battles the weights, we PUSH IN ON the nightstand...
</p><p></p><p id="slug">13B    FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH                                        13B
</p><p></p><p id="act">of Cutter and a beautiful young woman in happier times. Perhaps this is "Lisa."  Next to the photo is an Amtrack brochure and a ticket -- round trip -- Los Angeles to Orlando.  But it's the Amtrak brochure that really catches our attention.  It's illustrated with a bold drawing of a powerful locomotive.  PUSH IN ON the train as we...

</p><p></p><p id="act">Darkness.  Then... a real train bursts out of tunnel and hurtles PAST CAMERA.  It crosses a span somewhere in the Rocky Mountains, headed east.

</p><p></p><p id="slug">17     INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY LOCKDOWN - NIGHT                   17
</p><p></p><p id="act">RAIN streaks a window re-enforced with steel mesh. THUNDER CRASHES!
</p><p></p><p id="act">Bars slide open with a LOUD CLANG.  CAMERA FOLLOWS a distinguished, silver-haired ATTORNEY as he enters the bowels of a prison designed in hell.  He travels down a long corridor lined with cells containing the evil and the insane.  They jeer, laugh, taunt and spit at the Attorney as he runs their gauntlet of abuse.
</p><p></p><p id="act">At the end of the corridor, a stem-faced guard stands in front of an iron door.  The Attorney, wiping spit off his expensive suit with a handkerchief, shows the indifferent guard some papers.  The guard wheels open the heavy iron door.
</p><p></p><p id="act">CAMERA FOLLOWS the Attorney into a small dark room. The iron DOOR CLANGS shut behind him.  On the other side of a mesh screen sits Wolfgang, stripped naked, wearing handcuffs.  His body is hard and muscular, a map of ugly scars.  He greets his Attorney with a wolfish smile.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">WOLFGANG 
</p><p id="dia">what's wrong, Martin?  Haven't you ever seen a naked man before?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ATTORNEY 
</p><p id="dia">How can you be so calm?  They know who you are.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">WOLFGANG 
</p><p id="dia">Knowing it and proving it are two different things.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ATTORNEY 
</p><p id="dia">Will you listen to me?  They can prove it.  They've got the Welshman.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Wolfgang's eyes cloud.  They do that when something displeases him.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">WOLFGANG
</p><p id="dia">Go on.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ATTORNEY 
</p><p id="dia">The N.S.A. has him in protective custody.  He's connected you to Islamic Jihad, the American Embassy bombing in Beirut and God knows what else.  They're flying you to Los Angeles to stand trial.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">WOLFGANG 
</p><p id="dia">Then the solution's simple.  I must not reach Los Angeles.
</p><p></p><p id="act">ON Wolfgang's confident look...

</p><p></p><p id="slug">18     EXT. TRANS PACIFIC AIRLINES BUILDING (ORLANDO) - DAY     18
</p><p></p><p id="act">The logo of Trans Pacific atop a tower of glass and steel.  ANGLE DOWN TO street level as a taxi pulls up to the entrance and stops.  John Cutter climbs out.  We see him full figure in a dark suit -- ramrod straight --lean, hard and muscular.  Cutter pays the driver, hefts his bag and enters the building.
</p><p></p><p id="right">CUT TO:
</p><p></p><p id="slug">18A    INT. SLY DELVECCHIO'S OFFICE                             18A
</p><p></p><p id="act">An efficient young SECRETARY looks up from her computer as Cutter steps into the outer office.  He tosses his bag on the couch.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">SECRETARY 
</p><p id="dia">You must be Mister Cutter.  Mister Delvecchio's expecting you.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CUTTER 
</p><p id="dia">Don't buzz him.  I want this to be a surprise.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Cutter crosses the room and pushes open the big door to...
</p><p></p><p id="slug">18B    SLY'S INNER OFFICE                                       18B
</p><p></p><p id="act">Cutter is barely through the door when SLY DELVECCHIO jumps him from behind.
</p><p></p><p id="act">In a blinding flash of martial arts skill. Cutter flips Sly over his shoulder.  Sly hits the carpet with a thud. Swift as a cobra, Cutter is upon him -- knee planted in the center of Sly's chest, hand tight around Sly's throat -- thumb pressed to his jugular.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CUTTER 
</p><p id="spkdir">(with a smile)
</p><p id="dia">You're dead. Sly.  Get yourself buried.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Through his surprise and pain, Sly smiles back.  He's in his early 30s, a friendly, likable guy -- Cutter's buddy from way back.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">SLY 
</p><p id="spkdir">(his voice is a rough whisper) 
</p><p id="dia">Okay, I'm dead.  Now would you mind getting your big knee off my chest?
</p><p id="spkdir">(gasping)
</p><p id="dia">I can't breathe...
</p><p></p><p id="act">Cutter just smiles as Sly continues to gasp.  Sly is very convincing but Cutter's not buying.  He knows his friend too well.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">SLY 
</p><p id="dia">Cutter... please... I can't breathe...
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CUTTER 
</p><p id="dia">Sly, do the words 'acting lessons' mean anything to you?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">SLY 
</p><p id="spkdir">(really gasping)
</p><p id="dia">Cutter, no shit... you know I've got this asthma thing...
</p><p></p><p id="act">Cutter frowns and steps back.  As he does, sneaky Sly tries to hook him with his foot.  But Cutter has anticipated this.  He catches the foot with one hand and hoists Sly into the air so that he's hanging upside down -- face buried in the rug.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CUTTER 
</p><p id="spkdir">(amused) 
</p><p id="dia">How's that carpet taste?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">SLY 
</p><p id="dia">All right!  Okay!  Uncle!
</p><p></p><p id="act">Sly's Secretary appears in the doorway, alarmed to see her boss in this most undignified position.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">SECRETARY 
</p><p id="spkdir">(frightened)
</p><p id="dia">Mister Delvecchio?  Should I call Security?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">SLY
</p><p id="spkdir">(upside down) 
</p><p id="dia">Ellen, I am Security.
</p><p id="spkdir">(then; chuckling) 
</p><p id="dia">Don't worry.  It's just a couple of Navy buddies catching up on old times.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CUTTER 
</p><p id="dia">We're bonding.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">SLY 
</p><p id="spkdir">(to Cutter) 
</p><p id="dia">You want something?  Coffee?  Tea?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CUTTER 
</p><p id="dia">I'm fine.
</p><p id="spkdir">(to the Secretary) 
</p><p id="dia">But you'd better bring Mister Delvecchio some Therapeutic Mineral Ice.  He's not as young as he thinks he is.
</p><p></p><p id="act">The Secretary nods and backs away.  Cutter releases Sly and lets him crumple to the floor.  With a groan. Sly gets to his feet.  He straightens his suit and tie in a dignified manner.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">PRIEST 
</p><p id="dia">Gotta go now...
</p><p></p><p id="act">Priest slumps dead across the yoke, causing the plane to go into a steep dive.  Screams and pandemonium.  Everyone and everything is thrown forward.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Before Marti can act, a powerful hand grabs Priest and pulls him off the yoke and out of the pilot's seat.  It's Cutter.  He slides behind the controls, grabs the yoke and, with a mighty effort, straightens out the plane.

</p><p id="dia">Cutter's got the plane!
</p><p></p><p id="act">A huge cheer goes up.  But the loudest cheering comes from someone in the back of the room -- Chief Biggs. When everyone turns to look at him. Biggs scowls back.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BIGGS

</p><p></p><p id="act">A burst of RADIO STATIC.
