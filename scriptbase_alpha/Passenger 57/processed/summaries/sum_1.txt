Air travel is the safest, the FAA says.
But the FAA never figured the risk with Charles Rane on board.
"The Rane of Terror" has masterminded four terrorist attacks.
Soon there will be a fifth -- and that's bad news for the passengers on Flight 163.
But there's good news too: the man in seat 57!
Wesley Snipes plays John Cutter, an undercover security operative who enters the lavatory and exits to find Rane (Bruce Payne) and his gang have taken over.
Cutter's next move is clear.
Do.
Or be done to.
