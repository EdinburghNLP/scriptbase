TURNS, BLOWS ANOTHER KISS AND ONCE MORE WAVES GOODBYE.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Don't forget the checkee.  Can't
            produce playees without checkees.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            My hand.  My hand.  I can't turn my
            hand.
                   (he turns his hand)


THERE IS A RAPPING AT THE DOOR.  WE HEAR IT, THEY DON'T.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
                   (taking his hand)
            Don't worry.  I'll kiss it and make
            it well.
                   (she smothers his
                   hand with kissers)


                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (trying to rescue his hand)
            Enough.  It's better.  Please,
            Lambchop, it's better.  Stop.
            You're hurting it again.

CUT TO DOOR.  IT OPENS.  LEO BLOOM ENTERS.

                         BLOOM
                   (his forward motion
                   arrested by the
                   unbelievable scene)
            How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse
            me ... I mean ...

                         BIALYSTOCK
            You mean ooops, don't you?  Say
            ooops and get out.

                         BLOOM
            I'll wait in the hall ...

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Oooooooops!

                         BLOOM
                   (backing out of door)
            Ooooooops.

LITTLE OLD LADY HOPS OFF BIALYSTOCK'S LAP AND GOES TO DOOR.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
            I can't abide a peeping Tom.
            There's one in the apartment just
            opposite my bedroom window.  I
            swear that man NEVER takes his
            field glasses off me for a minute.

                                                            7.


SHE LOCKS DOOR AND STARTS BACK TOWARD BIALYSTOCK.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
            Feeling better?

BIALYSTOCK NODS HIS HEAD IN ASSENT.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
            Good.  Let's fool around.  Now,
            I'll be the innocent little milk
            maid and you'll be the naughty
            stable boy.
                   (she goes into her act)
            Oh, this milk is so heavy.  I'll
            never reach the house.  Help.  Will
            someone help me?

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (stopping her)
            Wait.  Wait.  We can't play today.
            I have too many appointments.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
                   (crushed)
            We can't play today?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Thursday.  Thursday.  We'll play
            Thursday.  We'll play the Contessa
            and the chauffeur.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
            Oh, the best one.

                          BIALYSTOCK
                   (trying to steer her
                   towards the door)
            Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
                   (she sits on the sofa)
            Oh, Bialy, please, just a little.
            Just a little.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (harassed)
            All right.  All right.

HE SQUATS DOWN IN FRONT OF HER IN CHAUFFEUR FASHION, HIS
HANDS ON THE WHEEL.

                                                            8.


                         LITTLE OLD LADY
            So, the Count hired you this
            morning, Rudolfo ... Watch the road
            ... Watch the road.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I can't take my eyes off you.  How
            can I drive when you drive me mad.
            Mad.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
                   (she squeals with delight)
            Rudolfo, you dirty pig!  Pull over.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (upright)
            Good.  That's enough.  We'll do the
            rest on Thursday.
                   (he reaches down and
                   helps her off the couch)
            That's a good girl.
                   (leading her to the door)
            It's always such fun to see you.

BIALYSTOCK OPENS THE DOOR AND USHERS HER OUT ONTO THE LANDING.

CUT TO HALLWAY.  FAR SHOT.  REVEALING BLOOM WAITING OUTSIDE.
WE SEE HIM.  THEY DO NOT.  BLOOM, VERY EMBARRASSED, HUGS THE
WALL TRYING TO MAKE HIMSELF LESS CONSPICUOUS.

MEDIUM SHOT.  BIALYSTOCK AND THE OLD LADY IN FRONT OF
BIALYSTOCK'S DOOR.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Until Thursday, then, you bawdy
            wench.

HE SLAPS HER ON THE RUMP.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
            Oooh.  I love it.  Hold me, touch me.

CUT TO BLOOM IN SHADOWS, AGHAST.

BACK TO MEDIUM SHOT LITTLE OLD LADY AND BIALYSTOCK.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Thursday.  I'll see you Thursday.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
            And we'll finish playing the
            Contessa and Rudolfo.

                                                            9.


                         BIALYSTOCK
            Good.  Yes.  Thursday.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
            And after that we'll play the
            Abduction and cruel rape of Lucretia
            ... And I'll play Lucretia.

CUT TO BLOOM IN SHADOWS.  IT IS ALL TOO MUCH FOR HIM.  HE
LOOKS THE OTHER WAY.  SUDDENLY HIS EYES WIDEN IN SURPRISE,
AS HE DISCOVERS ANOTHER MAN HIDING IN THE NEXT DOORWAY.  THE
MAN PUTS A FINGER TO HIS LIPS INDICATING SILENCE.  THERE IS
NO PLACE LEFT FOR BLOOM TO LOOK.  HE LOOKS TO HEAVEN.

BACK TO LITTLE OLD LADY AND BIALYSTOCK.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
            Oh, Thursday.  Will Thursday ever
            come?

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (to himself)
            Like clockwork.

SHE STARTS TO DESCEND.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
            I shall count the minutes.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Goodbye, my angel ... My angel!
                   (calling after her)
            Hey, touch me ... wait!  Hey, uh ...
            Lucretia, Lucretia!

WE HEAR A MOUNTING CLATTER OF FOOTSTEPS AS THE LITTLE OLD
LADY FLIES BACK UP THE STAIRS.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
                   (eagerly)
            Yes???

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Oh, Angelcake, you forgot to give
            me the check.  Can't produce a play
            without money, ha, ha, ha.

CUT TO BLOOM.  ONCE MORE HE STEALS A GLANCE AT THE STRANGER
HIDDEN IN THE SECOND DOORWAY.  ONCE AGAIN THE MAN GESTURES
FOR HIM TO BE SILENT.

CUT BACK TO BIALYSTOCK AND THE OLD LADY.

                                                           10.


                         LITTLE OLD LADY
                   (opening her handbag
                   and reaching inside)
            Of course, the check, I had it with
            me all the time.

SHE TAKES OUT THE CHECK AND HANDS IT TO HIM.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
            I don't know what's happening to me.
            I must be getting old.

BIALYSTOCK TAKES CHECK AND READS IT.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
            Is it all right?  I made it out to
            cash.  You didn't tell me the name
            of the play.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Oh, it's fine.  Fine.  Good.  Good.
            Bye.  Bye.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
            Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall
            count the minutes.

SHE STARTS TO DESCEND.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
                   (descending)
            Ta.  Ta.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (waving check at her)
            Ta.  Ta.

THE MAN, WHO HAS BEEN LURKING IN THE SECOND DOORWAY, SUDDENLY
SPRINGS INTO ACTION.  HE DARTS FORWARD AND QUICKLY TAKES THE
CHECK OUT OF BIALYSTOCK'S HAND.

                         THE MAN (LANDLORD)
            He who signs a lease, must pay rent.

HE SHOVES THE CHECK INTO HIS POCKET AND STARTS DOWN THE
STAIRS.

                         LANDLORD
            That's the law.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Murderer!  Thief!  How can you take
            the last penny out of a man's pocket?

                                                           11.


                         LANDLORD
                   (turns back, shrugs)
            I have to ... I'm a landlord!

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (shouting to heaven)
            Oh Lord, hear my plea.  Destroy him.
            He maketh a blight on the land.

CUT TO LANDLORD ON THE WAY DOWN.

                         LANDLORD
                   (to the Lord)
            Don't pay attention.  He's crazy.

CUT BACK TO BIALYSTOCK.  HE TURNS TO RE-ENTER HIS OFFICE.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (biting his knuckle)
            Nnnnn.  That hurt.
                   (he sighs)
            I'll have to make another call.

HE STARTS IN AND STOPS.  HE NOTICES BLOOM.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (to Bloom, quietly)
            Have you been there all this time?

BLOOM NODS.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            And did you see and hear everything?

BLOOM NODS.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Then what do you have to say for
            yourself?

                         BLOOM
            Uh ... uh ... ooooooops?

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (shouts)
            Who are you?  What do you want?
            Why are you loitering in my hallway?
            Speak, dummy, speak!  Why don't you
            speak?

                         BLOOM
            Scared.  Can't talk.

                                                           12.


                         BIALYSTOCK
            All right.  Get a hold of yourself.
            Take a deep breath, let it out
            slowly and tell me who you are.

                         BLOOM
                   (breathes deeply.
                   Words tumble from his
                   mouth as he exhales)
            I'm Leo Bloom, I'm an accountant,
            I'm from Whitehall and Marks, I was
            sent here to do your books and I'm
            terribly sorry I caught you with
            the old lady.
                   (he has run out of breath)


                         BIALYSTOCK
            "Caught you with the old lady."
            Come in, Mr. Tact.

CUT TO OFFICE.  THEY ENTER.  BLOOM ENTERS TIMOROUSLY.  HE
DOESN'T KNOW QUITE WHERE TO GO.  HE LOOKS TO BIALYSTOCK FOR
GUIDANCE.  BIALYSTOCK STUDIES BLOOM CURIOUSLY FROM HEAD TO
TOE.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            So you're an accountant, eh?

                         BLOOM
                   (timidly)
            Yes sir.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Then account for yourself!  Do you
            believe in God?  Do you believe in
            gold?  Why are you looking up old
            lady's dresses?  Bit of a pervert,
            eh?

BLOOM, WHO HAS BEEN QUAKING UNDER THE ASSAULT, REACHES INTO
HIS POCKET AND TAKES OUT THE TATTERED CORNER OF AN OLD BLUE
BABY BLANKET.  HE TWISTS THE BLUE BLANKET NERVOUSLY IN HIS
HANDS.

                         BLOOM
            Sir, I ...

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Never mind.  Never mind.  Do the
            books.  They're in that desk over
            there.  Top drawer.

                                                           13.


BLOOM DUTIFULLY GOES TO DESK.  OPENS TOP DRAWER AND BEGINS
REMOVING BOOKS.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            How dare you condemn me without
            knowing all the facts.

                         BLOOM
            But sir, I'm not condem ...

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Shut up.  I'm having a rhetorical
            conversation.
                   (to himself)
            How humiliating.  Max Bialystock.
            Max Bialystock.

BIALYSTOCK SUDDENLY WHEELS AND SHOUTS AT BLOOM.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            You know who I used to be?  Max
            Bialystock!  The King of Broadway!
            Six shows running at once.  Lunch
            at Delmonico's.  Two hundred dollar
            suits.  Look at me.  Look at me now!
            I'm wearing a cardboard belt!

HE RIPS THE BELT OFF AND HOLDS IT IN THE AIR.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I used to have thousands of
            investors begging, pleading, to put
            their money into a Max Bialystock
            production.

HE PICKS UP THE PICTURE ON DESK ('HOLD ME, TOUCH ME') TAKES
IT OVER TO OPEN CABINET FILLED WITH SIMILAR PICTURES.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Look at my investors now.  Voila!
                   (gestures at pictures)
            Hundreds of little old ladies
            stopping off at Max Bialystock's
            office to grab a last thrill on the
            way to the cemetery.

HE PUTS PICTURE BACK IN ITS PLACE.  LOOKS TOWARD BLOOM.

CUT TO BLOOM.  HE IS OBVIOUSLY TOUCHED BY THE GREAT MAN'S
DILEMMA.

CUT TO BIALYSTOCK.

                                                           14.


                         BIALYSTOCK
            You have exactly ten seconds to
            change that disgusting look of pity
            into one of enormous respect.  One
            ... Two ...

CUT TO BLOOM.  HE IS REALLY TRYING TO CHANGE HIS EXPRESSION.

CUT TO BIALYSTOCK.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Do the books!  Do the books!

CUT TO BLOOM.  HE IS GREATLY RELIEVED.

                         BLOOM
                   (sighing)
            Yes, sir.  Thank you.

HE PLUNGES INTO HIS WORK.

CUT TO BIALYSTOCK.  HE GOES TO WINDOW, LOOKS OUT.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (to himself)
            Window's so filthy, can't tell if
            it's day or night out there.

HE WIPES WINDOW WITH HIS CUFF.  LOOKS AT WINDOW.  NO GOOD.
LOOKS AT HIS GRIMY CUFF.  GRIMACES.  FROM HIS DESK HE TAKES
THE REMAINS OF A CARDBOARD CONTAINER OF COFFEE AND SLOSHES
IT AGAINST THE WINDOW.  HE WIPES WITH HIS TIE.  HE LOOKS
OVER HIS SHOULDER AT BLOOM TO SEE IF HE IS WATCHING.  BLOOM
IS WATCHING.  THEIR EYES MEET.  BLOOM'S EYES RETREAT.
BIALYSTOCK VICTORIOUSLY TURNS AWAY AND LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW
DOWN INTO THE STREET.

CAMERA:  SHOT OF STREET.  BIALYSTOCK'S POINT OF VIEW.  A
WHITE ROLLS ROYCE SLOWLY MAKES ITS WAY UP THE BLOCK.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (voice over as camera
                   follows Rolls)
            Look at that.  A white Rolls Royce.
            That's it baby, when you got it,
            flaunt it.

                         BLOOM
                   (off screen)
            Koff, koff ... ahem, ahem ...
            harrumph ...

                                                           15.


                         BIALYSTOCK
            I assume you are making those
            cartoon noises to attract my
            attention.  Am I correct in my
            assumption, you fish-faced enemy of
            the people?

BLOOM IS WOUNDED.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I have hurt your feelings.

BLOOM NODS.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Good, what is it?

                         BLOOM
            Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (looking at his watch)
            Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.

                         BLOOM
            Well, sir, it seems ...

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (interrupting)
            You have forty-eight seconds left.
            Hurry.  Hurry.

                         BLOOM
                   (speedily)
            In looking at your books, I've
            discovered that ...

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (interrupting)
            Twenty-eight seconds, hurry, hurry,
            you're using up your time.

IN HIS ANXIETY, BLOOM UNCONSCIOUSLY REACHES INTO HIS POCKET
TAKES OUT THE OLD BLUE BLANKET AND NERVOUSLY STROKES HIS
CHEEK WITH IT.

                         BLOOM
            Mr. Bialystock, I cannot function
            under these conditions.

BIALYSTOCK CURIOUSLY EYES THE BLANKET.

                         BLOOM
            You're making me extremely nervous.

                                                           16.


                         BIALYSTOCK
            What is that?  A handkerchief?

BLOOM QUICKLY BEGINS TO PUT AWAY HIS BLUE BLANKET.

                         BLOOM
            It's nothing ... nothing.

QUICK AS A FLASH, BIALYSTOCK REACHES OVER AND SNATCHES IT
OUT OF BLOOM'S HAND.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            If it's nothing, why can't I see it?

BLOOM LEAPS UP IN HOT PURSUIT OF HIS BLANKET.

                         BLOOM
                   (shrieking in panic)
            My blanket.  Give me my blue blanket.

BIALYSTOCK, TAKEN ABACK, HURRIEDLY GIVES THE BLANKET BACK TO
BLOOM.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Here, don't panic.

                         BLOOM
                   (clutching his blanket)
            I'm sorry ... I don't like people
            touching my blue blanket.  It's not
            important.  It's a minor compulsion.
            I can deal with it if I want to.
            It's just that I've had it ever
            since I was a baby and ... and ...
            I find it very comforting.

HE KISSES IT AND SHOVES IT INTO HIS POCKET.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (to himself)
            They come here.  They all come here.
            How do they find me?

                         BLOOM
                   (recovering his dignity)
            Mr. Bialystock ...

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Yes, Prince Mishkin, what can we do
            for you?

                                                           17.


                         BLOOM
            This is hardly a time for levity.
            I've discovered a serious error
            here in the accounts of your last
            play.

BIALYSTOCK MOVES AROUND THE DESK TO EXAMINE THE LEDGER.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Where?  What?

                         BLOOM
            According to the backer's list you
            raised $60,000.  But the show you
            produced only cost fifty-eight
            thousand.  There's two thousand
            dollars unaccounted for.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I went to a Turkish bath, who cares?
            The show was a flop.  What
            difference does it make?

                         BLOOM
            It makes a great deal of difference.
            That's fraud.  If they found out,
            you could go to prison.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Why should they find out?  It's
            only two thousand dollars,  Bloom,
            do me a favor, move a few decimal
            points around.  You can do it.
            You're an accountant.  The word
            'count' is part of your title.

                         BLOOM
                   (aghast)
            But that's cheating!

                         BIALYSTOCK
            It's not cheating ... It's charity.
            Bloom, look at me ... look at me!
            I'm drowning.  Other men sail
            through life.  Bialystock has
            struck a reef.  Bloom, I'm going
            under.  I am being sunk by a
            society that demands success, when
            all I can offer is failure.  Bloom,
            I'm reaching out to you.  Don't
            send me to jail.  Help!  Help!

                                                           18.


DURING BIALYSTOCK'S LAST SPEECH, BLOOM UNCONSCIOUSLY REACHES
INTO HIS POCKET, TAKES OUT THE BLUE BLANKET AND RUBS IT
ACROSS HIS CHEEK.

                         BLOOM
            Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (faintly)
            Help!

                         BLOOM
            All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could
            con you.

                         BLOOM
            Oh, it's all right ... wha?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Nothing.  Nothing.  Do it.  Do it.

                         BLOOM
                   (pouring over the accounts)
            Now let's see, two thousand dollars.
            That isn't much.  I'm sure I can
            hide it somewhere.  After all, the
            department of internal revenue
            isn't interested in a show that
            flopped.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You
            figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm
            gonna take a little nap.
                   (crossing to couch)
            Wake me if there's a fire.

HE HURLS HIMSELF DOWN ONTO THE COUCH.

CAMERA MOVES IN TO TIGHT SHOT OF BLOOM.

                         BLOOM
            Now let's see, if we add these
            figures, we get ...

CAMERA MOVES INTO CLOSE-UP OF BLOOM'S FINGER SWIFTLY MOVING
DOWN LONG COLUMN OF FIGURES.  HE COMES TO THE END AND
IMMEDIATELY WRITHES TOTAL BELOW.

BACK TO TIGHT SHOT OF BLOOM.  HE COMPARES PAGES.

                                                           19.


                         BLOOM
                   (musing to himself)
            Heh, heh, heh, amazing.  It's
            absolutely amazing.  But under the
            right circumstances, a producer
            could make more money with a flop
            than he could with a hit.

QUICK CUT TO BIALYSTOCK'S SLEEPING FACE.  HIS EYES POP OPEN.

CUT BACK TO BLOOM.

                         BLOOM
            Yes.  Yes.  It's quite possible.
            If he were certain the show would
            fail, a man could make a fortune.

CUT TO BIALYSTOCK.  BY NOW HE IS HALFWAY ACROSS THE ROOM.
HIS WHOLE BEING TINGLING WITH ALERTNESS.  HE MOVES TO
BLOOM'S DESK AND HOVERS OVER HIM, WAITING EXPECTANTLY FOR
MORE INFORMATION.  BUT BLOOM IS LOST IN HIS WORK, UNAWARE
THAT BIALYSTOCK IS HANGING ON HIS EVERY WORD.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Yes???

BLOOM LOOKS UP.  HE IS STARTLED TO SEE BIALYSTOCK'S FACE SO
CLOSE TO HIS OWN.

                         BLOOM
                   (at a loss)
            Yes, what?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            What you were saying.  Keep talking.

                         BLOOM
            What was I saying?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            You were saying that under the
            right circumstances, a producer
            could make more money with a flop
            than he could with a hit.

                         BLOOM
                   (smiling)
            Yes, it's quite possible.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            You keep saying that, but you don't
            tell me how.  How could a producer
            make more money with a flop than
            with a hit?

                                                           20.


BLOOM, SLIGHTLY EXASPERATED, PUTS HIS PENCIL DOWN AND FACES
BIALYSTOCK.  HE SPEAKS TO BIALYSTOCK AS A TEACHER WOULD A
STUDENT.

                         BLOOM
            It's simply a matter of creative
            accounting.  Let us assume, just
            for the moment, that you are a
            dishonest man.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Assume away!

                         BLOOM
            Well, it's very easy.  You simply
            raise more money than you really
            need.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            What do you mean?

                         BLOOM
            You've done it yourself, only you
            did it on a very small scale.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            What did I do?

                         BLOOM
            You raised two thousand more than
            you needed to produce your last play.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            So what?  What did it get me?  I'm
            wearing a cardboard belt.

                         BLOOM
            Ahhhhhh!  But that's where you made
            your error.  You didn't go all the
            way.  You see, if you were really a
            bold criminal, you could have
            raised a million.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            But the play only cost $60,000 to
            produce.

                         BLOOM
            Exactly.  And how long did it run?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            One night.

                                                           21.


                         BLOOM
            See?  You could have raised a
            million dollars, put on a sixty
            thousand dollar flop and kept the
            rest.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            But what if the play was a hit?

                         BLOOM
            Oh, you'd go to jail.  If the play
            were a hit, you'd have to pay off
            the backers, and with so many
            backers there could never be enough
            profits to go around, get it?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!!  So,
            in order for the scheme to work,
            we'd have to find a sure fire flop.

                         BLOOM
            What scheme?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            What scheme?  Your scheme, you
            bloody little genius.

                         BLOOM
            Oh, no.  No.  No.  I meant no
            scheme.  I merely posed a little,
            academic accounting theory.  It's
            just a thought.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Bloom, worlds are turned on such
            thoughts!

BIALYSTOCK STARTS MOVING IN ON BLOOM.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Don't you see, Bloom.  Darling,
            Bloom, glorious Bloom, it's so
            simple.  Step one:  We find the
            worst play in the world -- a sure
            flop.  Step two:  I raise a million
            dollars -- there's a lot of little
            old ladies in this world.  Step
            three:  You go back to work on the
            books.  Phoney lists of backers --
            one for the government, one for us.
            You can do it, Bloom, you're a
            wizard.
                         (MORE)

                                                           22.


                         BIALYSTOCK (CONT'D)
            Step four:  We open on Broadway and
            before you can say 'step five' we
            close on Broadway.  Step six:  We
            take our million dollars and fly to
            Rio de Janiero.

BIALYSTOCK GRABS BLOOM IN HIS ARMS AND BEGINS TO LEAD HIM IN
A WILD TANGO AROUND THE ROOM.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (sings)
            "Ah, Rio, Rio by the seao, meo,
            myo, meo ... "

                         BLOOM
                   (afraid of the
                   scheme, afraid of the
                   dance, afraid of Bialystock)
            Mr. Bialystock.  No.  Wait.  Please.
            You're holding me too tight.  I'm
            an honest man.  You don't understand.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (leading Bloom as he talks)
            No, Bloom, you don't understand.
            This is fate, this is destiny.
            There's no avoiding it.

AT THIS POINT, BIALYSTOCK SWEEPS BLOOM INTO AN ELABORATE DIP.

                         BLOOM
                   (the back of his head
                   practically touching
                   the floor)
            Mr. Bialystock, not more than five
            minutes ago, against my better
            judgment, I doctored your books.
            That, sir, is the ultimate extent
            of my criminal life.

BIALYSTOCK RAISES HIS FISTS TO THE HEAVENS IN DESPAIR.
BLOOM, EXPERIENCING A DEFINITE LACK OF SUPPORT, GOES CRASHING
TO THE FLOOR.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            OOOOOHH!  OOOOOHH!  OOOOOHH!
            OOOOOHH!  I WANT THAT MONEY!

CAMERA ON BLOOM AS HE LIES STRICKEN ON THE FLOOR.

                                                           23.


                         BLOOM
                   (to himself)
            Oh, I fell on my keys.
                   (he shifts slightly
                   to make himself more comfortable)
            I've got to get out of here.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (angrily hovering
                   over Bloom)
            You miserable, cowardly, wretched
            little caterpillar.  Don't you ever
            want to become a butterfly?  Don't
            you want to spread your wings and
            flap your way to glory?

BIALYSTOCK FLAPS HIS ARMS LIKE A HUGE PREDATORY BIRD.

                         BLOOM
                   (his eyes widened in terror)
            You're going to jump on me.

BIALYSTOCK STARES AT HIM INCREDULOUSLY.

                         BLOOM
            You're going to jump on me.  I know
            you're going to jump on me -- like
            Nero jumped on Poppea.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (nonplussed)
            What???

                         BLOOM
                   (by now he is shrieking)
            Poppea.  She was his wife.  And she
            was unfaithful to him.  So he got
            mad and he jumped on her.  Up and
            down, up and down, until he squashed
            her like a bug.  Please don't jump
            on me.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (shouting and jumping
                   up and down next to Bloom)
            I'm not going to jump on you!

                         BLOOM
                   (rolling away in terror)
            Aaaaaaaaaa!

                                                           24.


                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (hoisting Bloom to
                   his feet)
            Will you get a hold on yourself.

                         BLOOM
                   (up on his feet and
                   running for cover)
            Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!

HE RUNS TO A CORNER OF THE ROOM.  TRAPPED!  HE TURNS.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            What are you afraid of?  I'm not
            going to hurt you!  What's the
            matter with you?

                         BLOOM
            I'm hysterical.  I'm having
            hysterics.  I'm hysterical.  I
            can't stop.  When I get like this,
            I can't stop.  I'm hysterical.

BIALYSTOCK RUSHES TO THE DESK.  PICKS UP A CARAFE OF WATER
AND SHOSHES ITS CONTENTS INTO BLOOM'S FACE.

                         BLOOM
            I'm wet!  I'm wet!  I'm hysterical
            and I'm wet!

BIALYSTOCK IN A DESPERATE MOVE TO STOP BLOOM'S HYSTERICS,
SLAPS HIM ACROSS THE FACE.

                         BLOOM
                   (holding his face)
            I'm in pain!  And I'm wet!  And I'm
            still hysterical!

BIALYSTOCK RAISES HIS HAND AGAIN.

                         BLOOM
            No!  No!  Don't hit.  It doesn't
            help.  It only increases my sense
            of danger.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            What can I do?  What can I do?
            You're getting me hysterical.

                         BLOOM
            Go away from me.  You frighten me.
                   (he indicates the sofa)
            Sit over there.

                                                           25.


BIALYSTOCK SITS ON THE SOFA.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (exasperated)
            Okay.  I'm way over here.  Is that
            better?

                         BLOOM
            It's a little better, but you still
            look angry.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            How's this?
                   (he smiles sweetly)


                         BLOOM
            Good.  Good.  That's nice.  That's
            very nice.  I think I'm coming out
            of it now.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm
            definitely coming out of it.  Thank
            you for smiling.  It helped a great
            deal.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (for want of something
                   sensible)
            Well, you know what they say,
            "Smile and the world smiles with
            you."  Heh, heh.
                   (to himself)
            The man should be in a straight
            jacket.
                   (to Bloom)
            Feeling better?

                         BLOOM
            Much, thank you.  But I am a little
            lightheaded.  Maybe I should eat
            something.  Hysterics have a way of
            severely depleting one's blood
            sugar, you know.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            They certainly do.  They certainly
            do.  Come, let me take you to lunch.

                         BLOOM
            That's very kind of you, Mr.
            Bialystock, but I ...

                                                           26.


                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (interrupting)
            Nonsense, nonsense, my dear boy.  I
            lowered your blood sugar, but least
            I could do is raise it a little.

BLOOM LOOKS AT HIM SUSPICIOUSLY.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            And I promise you faithfully, I
            won't discuss that silly scheme to
            make a million dollars anymore.

BIALYSTOCK DONS HIS CAPE AND "BELASCO" HAT.  FROM A RACK HE
SELECTS A GOLD-TOPPED WALKING STICK.  HE GOES TO DOOR, OPENS
IT, AND WITH A GRAND FLOURISH, MOTIONS BLOOM TO PRECEDE HIM.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Avanti!

BLOOM GRACIOUSLY COMPLIES.  THEY EXIT.

CUT TO EXTERIOR.  ENTRANCE OF BIALYSTOCK'S OFFICE BUILDING.

THE DOOR OPENS.  IT IS HELD BY BIALYSTOCK.  BLOOM EXITS
BUILDING INTO STREET.

                         BLOOM
                   (to Bialystock, who
                   is holding door)
            Thank you.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Je vous empris.

THEY TURN UP 45TH STREET AND HEAD TOWARD BROADWAY.
BIALYSTOCK REACHES INTO HIS POCKET AND COUNTS HIS MONEY.  HE
LOOKS WORRIED.  SUDDENLY HIS FACE BRIGHTENS.

WE SEE WHAT BIALYSTOCK SEES.

CUT TO MURRAY THE BLINDMAN WORKING 45TH STREET.

CAMERA BACK TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.

BIALYSTOCK DROPS A STEP BEHIND, QUICKLY TAKES OFF HIS HAT
AND FLINGS IT THROUGH THE AIR.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (pointing to his hat)
            My hat.

                         BLOOM
            I'll get it.

                                                           27.


HE RACES AFTER IT.

BIALYSTOCK DETOURS SLIGHTLY TOWARD MURRAY THE BLINDMAN, WHO
WEARS A LARGE CARDBOARD SIGN WITH THE LEGEND: "MURRAY THE
BLINDMAN.  YOU CAN SEE.  I CAN'T.  GIVE!"  INSCRIBED ON IT.
BIALYSTOCK REACHES DOWN INTO HIS CUP AND GRABS A FIST FULL
OF COINS.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Murray, I'm going to lunch.  I took
            two dollars.

                         MURRAY THE BLINDMAN
            Okay, Bialy, that makes six eighty
            you owe me.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I know.  Don't worry.  You'll get
            it.  You'll get it.

                         MURRAY THE BLINDMAN
                   (tapping his way along)
            Well, don't forget about it.  I
            need it.  Nobody understands.  I'm
            competing with giants.  The Greater
            New York Fund.  The March of Dimes.
            The Community Chest.  They're
            driving me out of business.

BLOOM COMES DASHING BACK WITH HAT IN HAND.

                         BLOOM
                   (out of breath)
            I got it, Mr. Bialystock.

HE PROFFERS HAT TO BIALYSTOCK.  BIALYSTOCK TAKES IT.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Thank you, Leo.  And call me Max.
            You know, I don't let everybody
            call me Max.  It's only people I
            really like.

                         BLOOM
                   (trying it on)
            Okay ... Max!  And you can call me
            Leo.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I already have.  Come on.

                         BLOOM
            Oh.

                                                           28.


                         BIALYSTOCK
            Where would you like to eat?

                         BLOOM
            Well, Max, I don't know, Max.  What
            do you think, Max?

BIALYSTOCK QUIETLY WINCES AT THE SURFEIT OF MAX.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Let me see ... it's such a beautiful
            day.  Why waste it indoors.  I've
            got it!  Let's go to Coney Island!
            We'll lunch at the sea shore.

                         BLOOM
            Coney Island??

                         BIALYSTOCK
            What's the matter, Leo?  Don't you
            like Coney Island?

                         BLOOM
            I ... I love it.  I haven't been
            there since I was a kid.  But it's
            nearly two o'clock.  I really
            should be getting back to Whitehall
            and Marks.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and
            Marks are concerned, you're working
            with Bialystock, right?

                         BLOOM
            Right.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Then stick with Bialystock!

SWISH PAN CUT TO CONEY ISLAND.

FAR SHOT OF BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM AMIDST THE CROWD AT A
CUSTARD STAND.

CAMERA ZOOMS IN.  TWO SHOT.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (to Custard Man)
            We'll have another round.

                         CUSTARD MAN
            What kind now, sports?

                                                           29.


                         BIALYSTOCK
            What kind now, Leo?

                         BLOOM
                   (he's loosening up)
            I don't know.  Let's see.  We've
            had chocolate, vanilla, banana -
            let's go green.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (to Custard Man)
            Two pistachios, my good man.

                         CUSTARD MAN
            I'm not your good man, I happen to
            own this establishment.
                   (he turns to fill the order)


                         BIALYSTOCK
            Everybody's a big shot.
                   (turns to Bloom)
            Well, Leo, are you having a good
            time?

                         BLOOM
            I don't know.  I think so.  I feel
            very strange.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Maybe you're happy.

                         BLOOM
            Yes.  That's it.  Happy.  Well,
            whatta ya think of that.  Happy.

QUICK DISSOLVE TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ON THE WHIP (A CONEY
ISLAND RIDE).  THEY ARE TIGHTLY SQUEEZED INTO ONE OF THE
MOVING SEATS.  THEY ARE BETWEEN "WHIPS".

                         BLOOM
                   (licking his pistachio
                   custard.  He is ecstatic)
            I love it.  I love it.  Get set.
            We're coming to another turn.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (working, relentlessly
                   working on Bloom)
            Bloom, it can always be like this.
            Life can be beautiful.  Let me show
            you.  Stick with ...

THEY HIT THE TURN.

                                                           30.


                         BIALYSTOCK
            Bialysto-o-o-o-ckk.

QUICK DISSOLVE TO BARKER SELLING TICKETS IN FRONT OF TUNNEL
OF LOVE.  MEDIUM SHOT OF EXIT.  A LITTLE BOAT COMES OUT.  IN
IT ARE A MAN AND A WOMAN EMBRACING.  IT IS FOLLOWED BY
ANOTHER.  IN IT THERE IS A SAILOR KISSING A GIRL.  BOAT
NUMBER THREE COMES OUT.  IN IT ARE BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.

CLOSE IN TO A TIGHT TWO SHOT.  BLOOM IS MESMERIZED.
BIALYSTOCK SPEAKS IN A SOFT, ENCHANTING TONE.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Money is honey.  Money is honey.
            Money can put soft things next to
            your skin.  Silk ... satin ... women.

CLOSE-UP OF BLOOM'S EYES.  THEY WIDEN ON THE WORD "WOMEN."

QUICK DISSOLVE TO PARACHUTE JUMP.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ARE
SEATED IN A LITTLE GONDOLA THAT SWINGS BENEATH A HUGE
PARACHUTE.  THEY ARE BUCKLING THEMSELVES IN.

                         BLOOM
            But if we're caught, we'll go to
            prison.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (sensing victory, he
                   marshals his forces
                   for the final assault)
            You think you're not in prison now?
            Living in a grey little room.
            Going to a grey little job.  Leading
            a grey little life.

                         BLOOM
            You're right.  You're absolutely
            right.  I'm a nothing.  I spend my
            life counting other people's
            money -- people I'm smarter than,
            better than.  Where's my share?
            Where's Leo Bloom's share?  I want,
            I want, I want, I want everything
            I've ever seen in the movies!

THE PARACHUTE BEGINS TO ASCEND.  WE FOLLOW.

                         BLOOM
                   (coming out of it)
            Hey, we're going up.

                                                           31.


                         BIALYSTOCK
            You bet your boots, Leo.  It's
            Bialystock and Bloom -- on the rise.
            Upward and onward.  Say, you'll
            join me.  Nothing can stop us.

BIALYSTOCK OFFERS HIS HAND TO BLOOM.

                         BLOOM
                   (shouting at the top
                   of his lungs)
            I'll do it!  By God, I'll do it!

BLOOM GRABS BIALYSTOCK'S HAND AND SHAKES IT FIRMLY.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            This is where we belong, Leo.  On
            top of the world.  Top of the world!

THEY HIT THE TOP.  THE PARACHUTE IS RELEASED, THEY QUICKLY
PLUMMET DOWN.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Oiiiiiii!!!

                         BLOOM
            Ohhhhhhhh!!!

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM DROP OUT OF FRAME.

SLOW DISSOLVE TO BIALYSTOCK'S OFFICE.  NIGHT.  OVERHEAD SHOT.
BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ARE BATHED IN A SMALL POOL OF
CONCENTRATED LIGHT.  THEY ARE DOWN TO THEIR SHIRT SLEEVES.
THEY ARE FEVERISHLY READING PLAY MANUSCRIPTS.  ALL ABOUT
THEM ARE STREWN COFFEE CONTAINERS, SOME EMPTY, SOME HALF-
FILLED.  THERE IS A HUGE PILE OF DISCARDED SCRIPTS ON THE
FLOOR.

CUT TO TIGHT SHOT OF LEO BLOOM AS HE READS SCRIPT.  HE LOOKS
UP, PUSHES HIS GLASSES BACK AND MASSAGES THE BRIDGE OF HIS
NOSE.

                         BLOOM
            Max, let's call it a night.  It's
            two in the morning.  I don't know
            what I'm reading anymore.

PULL BACK TO TWO SHOT.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Read, read.  We've got to find the
            worst play ever written.

                                                           32.


BIALYSTOCK TURNS HIS ATTENTION TO A NEW SCRIPT.  HE CRACKS
IT OPEN AND BEGINS READING.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Hmmnn.  "Gregor Samsa awoke one
            morning to find he had been
            transformed into a giant cock-a-
            roach."

IN A RAGE BIALYSTOCK FLINGS THE MANUSCRIPT ONTO THE PILE OF
DISCARDS AS HE BELLOWS:

                         BIALYSTOCK
            It's good!!!

CAMERA MOVES UP AND WE DISSOLVE THROUGH TO MEDIUM SHOT OF
OFFICE.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ARE THOROUGHLY DISHEVELED AND
BADLY IN NEED OF A SHAVE.

                         BLOOM
                   (mumbling to himself
                   as he reads)
            Wait a minute, I've read this part.
            I'm reading plays I read this
            morning.

HE GETS UP, STRETCHES, GOES TO WINDOW AND RAISES SHADE.
SUNLIGHT FLOODS THE ROOM.  HE REELS BACK AS THOUGH STRUCK.

                         BLOOM
            Good lord, it's morning.  Let's
            face it, we'll never find it.
                   (he turns to face Bialystock)
            Max, tomorrow's another day.
            Today's another day.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (off-camera.  Crazy
                   little voice)
            We'll never find it, eh?  We'll
            never find it, eh?  Ha, ha, ha, ha,
            ha.

CUT TO BIALYSTOCK.  HE IS STANDING.  AT HIS FEET LIES A
SCRIPT.  HE DANCES AROUND IT, HIS ARMS FOLDED ACROSS HIS
CHEST.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (as he does an insane
                   little jig around the script)
            You can't smell it when it's under
            your nose.  You can't see it when
            it's right before your eyes.
                         (MORE)

                                                           33.


                         BIALYSTOCK (CONT'D)
            You can't feel it when it's in your
            hand, when it's in your pocket.

CUT TO MEDIUM SHOT.

                         BLOOM
            Max, what is it?  What are you
            doing?  What's happening?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I'll tell you what's happening.
            We've struck gold.  Not fool's
            gold, but real gold.  The mother
            lode.  The mother lode.  The mother
            of them all.

                         BLOOM
                   (brightening)
            You found a flop!

                         BIALYSTOCK
            A flop, ha!  That's putting it
            mildly.  A disaster!  A catastrophe!
            An outrage!  A guaranteed-to-close-
            in-one-night beauty!

HE BENDS DOWN, PICKS UP THE SCRIPT AND SHAKES IT IN BLOOM'S
FACE.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            This is freedom from want forever.
            This is a house in the country.
            This is a Rolls Royce and a Bentley.
            This is wine, women and song and
            women.

BLOOM SNATCHES THE SCRIPT FROM HIS HANDS AND READS ALOUD THE
TITLE.

CUT TO CLOSE-UP.  TITLE OF SCRIPT.

                         BLOOM
                   (voice over)
            "SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER, A Gay Romp
            with Adolph and Eva in
            Berchtesgarten."  Fantastic!

BACK TO TWO SHOT.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            It's practically a love letter to
            Hitler!

                                                           34.


                         BLOOM
                   (ecstatic)
            It won't run a week!

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Run a week?  Are you kidding?  This
            play has got to close in the first
            act.

                         BLOOM
            Who wrote it?

CUT TO AUTHOR'S NAME ON THE MANUSCRIPT:  By FRANZ LIEBKIND.

DISSOLVE THROUGH AUTHOR'S NAME TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM,
SHAVED AND DAPPER, WALKING DOWN STREET IN A RUN-DOWN TENEMENT
NEIGHBORHOOD.

                         BLOOM
            Here it is -- 415.

THEY MARCH UP STOOP TO NUMBER 415.  THEIR MOTION IS ARRESTED
BY A QUERULOUS COMMAND ISSUED IN PHLEGMATIC TONES BY THE
SUPERINTENDENT OF THE BUILDING (A WOMAN IN HER LATE FORTIES)
WHO IS LEANING OUT OF HER WINDOW WHICH IS ADJACENT TO THE
STOOP.

                         SUPER
            Who do you want?

                         BLOOM
                   (taken aback)
            I beg your pardon?

                         SUPER
            Who do you want?  No one gets in
            the building unless I know who they
            want ... I'm the concierge.  My
            husband used to be the concierge.
            He's dead.  Now I'm the concierge.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (imperiously)
            We are seeking Mr. Franz Liebkind.

                         SUPER
            Oh, the kraut.  He's on the top
            floor.  Apartment twenty-three.

                         BLOOM
            Thank you.

THEY START INTO THE BUILDING.

                                                           35.


                         SUPER
            But you won't find him there.  He's
            up on the roof with his birds.  He
            keeps birds.  Dirty, disgusting,
            filthy, lice-ridden birds.  You
            used to be able to sit out on the
            stoop like a person.  Not anymore.
            No sir.  Birds!  You get my drift?

                         BLOOM
            We ... uh ... get your drift.
            Thank you, Madam.

                         SUPER
            I'm not a madam.  I'm a concierge.

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ENTER THE BUILDING.

CUT TO FRANZ LIEBKIND.  HE IS IN HIS EARLY FORTIES.  HE IS
WEARING, AS ALWAYS, A GERMAN HELMET.  HE CROUCHES BESIDE A
HUGE PIGEON COOP.  IN HIS LEFT HAND HE TENDERLY HOLDS A
PIGEON.  IN HIS RIGHT, A SMALL PHOTO OF ADOLPH HITLER.  HE
SHOWS THE PICTURE TO THE BIRD.  HE MOVES IT BACK AND FORTH
UNTIL HE IS SURE THE BIRD IS FOCUSED ON IT PROPERLY.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (to pigeon)
            Hilda, look ... look good ...
            Hilda, you're not looking.  Hilda,
            if he lives, I know you will find
            him.

HE KISSES THE BIRD AND TOSSES IT SKYWARD.

CUT TO ROOF DOOR.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ENTER ONTO THE ROOF.
THEY LOOK FOR LIEBKIND.  HE IS NOT ON THAT SIDE OF ROOF.
THEY WALK AROUND TO OTHER SIDE.  AS SOON AS THEY TURN THE
CORNER, THEY SPOT LIEBKIND CROUCHED NEAR THE COOP.

                         BLOOM
                   (quietly to Bialystock)
            He's wearing a German helmet.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (in a fierce whisper)
            Shhh.  Don't say anything to offend
            him.  We need that play.
                   (cups his hands to
                   his mouth and calls
                   up to the coop)
            Franz Liebkind?

LIEBKIND IS NOT AWARE OF THEIR PRESENCE UNTIL HE HEARS HIS
NAME CALLED.

                                                           36.


STARTLED, HE QUICKLY FLIPS HITLER'S PICTURE UNDER HIS HELMET.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (he speaks with a
                   German accent)
            I vas never a member of the Nazi
            party.  I am not responsible.  I
            only followed orders.  Who are you?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Mr. Liebkind, wait.  You don't
            understand.

                         LIEBKIND
            Vhy do you persecute me?  My papers
            are in order.  I love my country.
                   (he sings)
            "Oh, beautiful for spacious skies,
            For amber vaves of grain."

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Mr. Liebkind, wait ...

                         LIEBKIND
                   (singing)
            "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy ...

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (interrupting)
            Mr. Liebkind, relax, relax, we're
            not from the government.  We came
            here to talk to you about your play.

                         LIEBKIND
            My play?  You mean, "Springtime For
            ... " you know who?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Yes.

                         LIEBKIND
            Vat about it?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            We loved it.  We thought it was a
            masterpiece.  That's why we're here.
            We want to produce it on Broadway.

                         LIEBKIND
            You're not, as you Americans say,
            dragging my leg, are you?

                                                           37.


                         BLOOM
            No, not at all sir, we're quite
            serious.  We want to produce your
            play.
                   (he reaches into his
                   attache case and
                   displays a legal
                   looking document)
            I have the contracts right here.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (looking up)
            Oh joy of joys!  Oh, dream of
            dreams!  I can't believe it.
                   (he turns to the pigeons)
            Birds, birds, do you hear?  Otto,
            Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do
            you hear?  Ve are going to clear
            the Fuhrer's name.  Fly, fly,
            spread the words.

HE OPENS THE CAGES AND SETS THE BIRDS FREE.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (singing at the top
                   of his lungs)
            "Deutchland, Deutchland, uber
            alles, Uber alles in der velt."

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM LOOK AT EACH OTHER IN ALARM.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (singing for all he's worth)
            "Deutchland, Deutchland ... "

                         BLOOM
                   (shouting)
            Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.

LIEBKIND STOPS SINGING.

                         LIEBKIND
            Vat?

                         BLOOM
            People can hear you.

                         LIEBKIND
            OH.
                   (he sings)
            "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy, Yankee
            Doodle is my ... " Listen, this is
            not place to talk.  Come!

                         LIEBKIND (CONT'D)
            We go to my flat.  An occasion like
            this calls for Schnapps.

DISSOLVE TO FRANZ LIEBKIND'S APARTMENT.  LIEBKIND HAS JUST
FINISHED POURING THREE GLASSES OF SCHNAPPS.  HE PUTS THE
BOTTLE ON A TRAY.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (as he hands glasses
                   to Bialystock and Bloom)
            Mr. Bloom, Mr. Bialystock.
            Gentleman, with your permission, I
            would like to propose a toast to
            the greatest man that ever lived.
            Let us say his name quietly to
            ourselves.  The walls have ears.

CUT TO TIGHT SHOT OF FRANZ LIEBKIND.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (a fervent whisper)
            Adolph Hitler.
                   (he downs drink)


CUT TO TIGHT SHOT OF BLOOM.

                         BLOOM
                   (whisper)
            Sigmund Freud.
                   (he downs drink)


CUT TO TIGHT SHOT OF BIALYSTOCK.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (whisper)
            Max Bialystock.
                   (he downs drink)


BACK TO SCENE.

                         LIEBKIND
            I vas vit him a great deal, you know.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            With whom?

                                                           39.


                         LIEBKIND
                   (astonished by the question)
            Vit the Fuhrer, of course.  He
            liked me.  Out of all the household
            staff at Berchtesgarten, I vas his
            favorite.  I vas the only one
            allowed into his chambers at bedtime.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            No kidding?

                         LIEBKIND
            Oh, sure.  I used to take him his
            hot milk and his opium.  Achhh,
            those were the days.  Vat good
            times ve had.  Dinner parties vit
            lovely ladies and gentlemen,
            singing und dancing.  You know, not
            many people knew about it, but the
            Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Really, I never dreamed ...

                         LIEBKIND
                   (flies into an
                   indignant rage)
            That's because you were taken in by
            that verdampter Allied propaganda.
            Such filthy lies.  But nobody said
            a bad vord about Winston Churchill,
            did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!
                   (he gestures V for victory)
            Churchill, vit his cigars and his
            brandy and his rotten paintings.
            Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would
            say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not
            Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me
            tell this, and you're getting it
            straight from the horse, Hitler vas
            better looking than Churchill, he
            vas a better dresser than Churchill,
            had more hair, told funnier jokes,
            and could dance the pants off
            Churchill!

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (swinging along)
            That's exactly why we want to do
            this play.  To show the world the
            true Hitler, the Hitler you knew,
            the Hitler you loved, the Hitler
            with a song in his heart.

                         BIALYSTOCK (CONT'D)
                   (to Bloom)
            Leo, quick, the contract.

BLOOM QUICKLY WHIPS THE CONTRACT OUT OF HIS POCKET, PRODUCES
A PEN, HANDS THEM TO BIALYSTOCK.  BIALYSTOCK SPREADS THE
CONTRACT OUT ON THE TABLE BEFORE LIEBKIND.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Here, sign here, Franz Liebkind.
            And make your dream a reality.

HE HANDS LIEBKIND THE PEN.  LIEBKIND REFUSES IT.

                         LIEBKIND
            Wait.  No.  How do I know I can
            trust you?  How do I know you vill
            present this play in the manner and
            spirit in vhich it vas conceived?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            We swear it!

                         LIEBKIND
            Not good enough... Vould you be
            villing to take the Siegfried oath?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Yes.  We would!

INSERT:  CLOSE-UP BLOOM.  HE LOOKS WORRIED.

                         LIEBKIND
            Good.  I will make the preparations.

LIEBKIND LEAVES THE ROOM.

                         BLOOM
                   (anxious whisper)
            Max, I don't want to take any
            Siegfried Oath.  I don't know what
            it is, but I don't want to take it.
            We might end up in the German Army.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Shut up, you idiot.  He's a harmless
            nut.  Play along with him.  It's
            almost in the bag.

LIEBKIND ENTERS.  HE IS LADEN DOWN WITH ALL SORTS OF
RITUALISTIC PARAPHERNALIA.  LIEBKIND PLACES ALL THE STUFF ON
THE TABLE.  WITHOUT A WORD TO THEM, HE GOES TO PHONOGRAPH.

                                                           41.


IN A FEW SECONDS WE HEAR THE OPENING STRAINS OF WAGNER'S
"RIDE OF THE VALKYRIES."  AS THE MUSIC BOOMS LOUDER, LIEBKIND
ADDRESSES THEM.

                         LIEBKIND
            Please to don your helmets.

FROM THE TABLE THEY TAKE CLASSIC WAGNERIAN HELMETS (WITH
HORNS) AND PLACE THEM ON THEIR HEADS.

                         LIEBKIND
            Please to light your candles.

THEY EACH TAKE A HUGE WHITE CANDLE FROM THE TABLE AND LIGHT
IT.  LIEBKIND FLICKS THE LIGHT SWITCH.  NOW THEY ARE IN THE
DARK EXCEPT FOR THE GLOW OF THEIR CANDLES.

                         LIEBKIND
            Please repeat after me.  I solemnly
            swear...

                         BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM
            I solemnly swear...

                         BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM
                   (spiritlessly saluting)
            Heil you know who!

                         LIEBKIND
            Good.  Good.  Now ve sign the
            contract.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Good.  Good.
                   (he hands Liebkind
                   the pen)


                         LIEBKIND
            No.  No.  Not in ink.  We'll
            desecrate the oath.  It must be
            done in blood.

CUT TO BLOOM'S FACE.  IT IS A SILENT OI.

                         LIEBKIND
            Fingers, please.

                                                           43.


BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM EXTEND THEIR FOREFINGERS AND LOOK THE
OTHER WAY.  LIEBKIND PRICKS THEM WITH THE SACRED SAFETY PIN,
AND SQUEEZES A FEW DROPS OF BLOOD FROM EACH INTO THE SACRED
VESSEL (A JAR COVER).  HE DOES THE SAME WITH HIS OWN FINGER.

                         LIEBKIND
            Ve vill sign vit this sacred qvill
            taken from the last chicken I
            served at Berchtesgarten.

LIEBKIND SIGNS.  "THE RIDE OF THE VALKYRIES" REACHES ITS
ZENITH.  IT ECHOES THROUGH THE ROOM AS WE FADE OUT.

FADE IN ON BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM AS THEY WALK UP STREET AWAY
FROM TENEMENT.  IT IS LATE AFTERNOON.  THEY ARE BOTH WEARING
SWASTIKA ARM BANDS.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (triumphantly whacking
                   the contract with the
                   back of his hand)
            There it is... in red and white!
            "Springtime For Hitler," signed,
            sealed and delivered.
                   (he notices Bloom's
                   dour expression)
            What's the matter with you?

                         BLOOM
            Look, I'm just not wearing this arm
            band.  I don't care how big the
            deal is.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (placating him)
            Okay, take it off, take it off.

THEY TAKE OFF THEIR ARM BANDS AND TOSS THEM INTO A LITTER
BASKET.  BIALYSTOCK SPOTS A PASSING TAXI.  HE WHISTLES.  IT
STOPS.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (to cab driver as he
                   opens door)
            The Blue Gypsy.

                         BLOOM
                   (about to enter cab
                   with Bialystock)
            Why are we going to the Blue Gypsy?!

                                                           44.


                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (stopping Bloom from
                   entering cab)
            We are not going to The Blue Gypsy.
            I am going to The Blue Gypsy.

BIALYSTOCK GETS INTO CAB AND SLAMS THE DOOR.  HE CONTINUES
SPEAKING TO BLOOM THROUGH THE WINDOW.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I have a rendez-vous with a lady of
            some means.  You see dear Bloom,
            phase one is complete, the play is
            ours.  We are now entering phase
            two -- the raising of the money.
            In the days to come, you will see
            very little of me, for Bialystock
            is launching himself into little-
            old-lady-land.
                   (to cab driver)
            Avanti!

THE CAB SPEEDS AWAY.

SWISH PAN CUT TO TIGHT SHOT OF LITTLE OLD LADY #3.  IN HER
HAND SHE HOLDS A BUBBLING GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE.  SHE RAISES IT
TO BIALYSTOCK.

PULL BACK TO TWO SHOT OF BIALYSTOCK AND LITTLE OLD LADY.
THEY ARE SEATED IN A CORNER BOOTH OF A LITTLE VIENNESE CAFE.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY #3
            Here's to the success of your new
            play.

BIALYSTOCK RAISES HIS GLASS.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Our play, my love.

HE GALLANTLY INTERTWINES HIS ARMS IN HERS IN A LOVER'S TOAST.
IT IS HARD TO DRINK WITH ARMS ENTWINED, ESPECIALLY IF ONE OF
THE ARMS IS ATTACHED TO A LITTLE OLD LADY.  THE TOAST IS A
FIASCO, BIALYSTOCK GETTING MOST OF THE CHAMPAGNE OVER HIS
VEST AND TROUSERS.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY #3
            Oh, I'm sorry, Bialy, did I wet you?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Think nothing of it, my dear.  A
            mere trifle.  A mere trifle.  Did
            you bring your checkbook?

                                                           45.


                         LITTLE OLD LADY #3
            It's right here in my purse and I
            made it out just as you told me --
            to cash.  That's a funny name for a
            play.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Think nothing of it.

SHE SNAPS OPEN HER LITTLE BEADED PURSE, TAKES OUT THE CHECK
AND BEGINS TO HAND IT TO BIALYSTOCK.  AT THIS MOMENT, WE ARE
ASSAULTED BY THE PASSIONATE SOUND OF A CRYING VIOLIN.

CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL A VIOLINIST IN GYPSY ATTIRE
CLOSING IN ON THE TABLE.  THE LITTLE OLD LADY IS DELIGHTED
BY THE VIOLINIST AND UNFORTUNATELY FOR BIALYSTOCK STOPS THE
PASSAGE OF THE CHECK AS HER ATTENTION IS DIVERTED.
BIALYSTOCK CAUTIOUSLY REACHES OUT TO SNATCH THE CHECK BUT
EACH TIME THAT HE DOES, A TURN IN THE MUSIC MAKES THE LITTLE
OLD LADY CLUTCH HER HEART.  BIALYSTOCK IS VERY UNHAPPY.  HE
QUIETLY BRINGS HIS FOOT FROM BENEATH THE TABLE AND PLACES IT
DIRECTLY OVER THE FOOT OF THE VIOLINIST.

CUT TO CLOSE-UP OF BIALYSTOCK'S FOOT POISED OVER VIOLINIST'S
FOOT.  BIALYSTOCK PROCEEDS TO CRUSH VIOLINIST'S FOOT.

CUT TO VIOLINIST'S FACE.  SOMEHOW IT CONVEYS TO US ALL THE
MISERY AND PAIN OF THE HUMAN CONDITION.  WITH EYES CROSSED
BY GRIEF, HE LIMPS TO ANOTHER TABLE.  BIALYSTOCK QUICKLY
REACHES OUT AND SNATCHES THE CHECK.

SWISH PAN CUT TO HANSOM CAB THREADING ITS WAY THROUGH
CENTRAL PARK.  NIGHT.

CUT TO INTERIOR OF CAB.  BIALYSTOCK IS COZILY ENSCONCED WITH
LITTLE OLD LADY #4.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (taking check from
                   old lady)
            Thank you, my dear.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY #4
            Oh, Bialy, Bialy, tell me again.
            Tell me again.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Edna, I swear on my life, you don't
            look a day over sixty-five.

SWISH PAN CUT TO CITY TRAFFIC.  DAY.  A TAXI FILLS THE
SCREEN.  AS IT MOVES OUT OF FRAME, WE DISCOVER BIALYSTOCK
AND LITTLE OLD LADY #5 ASTRIDE A RED AND WHITE HONDA MOTOR
SCOOTER.  AS THEY ROAR PAST THE CAMERA, BIALYSTOCK SHOUTS.

                                                           46.


                         BIALYSTOCK
            Clear the road!  Clear the road!

                         LITTLE OLD LADY #5
                   (clutching Bialystock fiercely)
            Go, Bialy, baby, go!

SWISH PAN CUT TO POSH PARK AVENUE APARTMENT.  NIGHT.  A
PRIVATE CONCERN IS IN PROGRESS.  A THIN, CONSUMPTIVE-LOOKING
YOUNG MAN FINGERS HIS WAY THROUGH A CHOPIN NOCTURNE.

CAMERA SLOWLY PANS THE ROOM.  SEATED IN A SEMI-CIRCLE AROUND
THE PIANO ON VARIOUS PIECES OF DELICATE EMPIRE FURNITURE IS
AN AUSTERE GROUP OF ELDERLY DIGNIFIED PATRONS OF THE ARTS.
SUDDENLY AN OLD LADY'S SHRIEK RENDS THE AIR.  EVERYONE'S
HEAD TURNS.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY #6
                   (slightly flustered)
            Go on with the concert!  Go on with
            the concert!  It's nothing.  Nothing.

BIALYSTOCK STARES STRAIGHT AHEAD.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY #6
                   (to Bialystock, smiling)
            You dirty man.

SWISH PAN CUT TO NEW YORK STREET.  OLD FASHIONED LIMOUSINE
PULLS INTO VIEW.  THE WINDOW SHADES ARE DRAWN.  AS IT
PASSES, WE DETECT STRANGE SOUNDS EMANATING FROM THE INTERIOR.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY #7
                   (off camera)
            Tee hee, ha ha ha, ho ho, ooo, ooo,
            teehee hee.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (off camera, simultaneously)
            Heh, heh, heh.  Hah, hah, hah.

THE CAR DRIVES OUT OF FRAME.

SWISH PAN CUT TO SCULPTOR'S ATELIER.  DAY.  AN ANCIENT
LITTLE OLD LADY WEARING A SCULPTOR'S SMOCK IS FEEBLY CHIPPING
AWAY WITH CHISEL AND HAMMER AT A HUGE SQUARE BLOCK OF MARBLE.
SHE MAKES NOT A SCRATCH ON IT.

CAMERA DOLLIES BACK TO REVEAL BIALYSTOCK, HER SUBJECT,
STANDING NUDE, EXCEPT FOR LOIN CLOTH, HOLDING UP AN ENORMOUS
GLOBE.  HE IS OBVIOUSLY ATLAS.

                                                           47.


                         LITTLE OLD LADY #8
                   (stepping back to
                   admire her work)
            Well, Bialy, how's it coming?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            It's beautiful, Alma, beautiful.
                   (to the heavens)
            Oi.

SWISH PAN CUT TO LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.  BIALYSTOCK, DRESSED
AS A TURKISH SLAVE, IS ASLEEP ON THE SOFA.  THE ROOM HAS
BEEN DONE IN A BYZANTINE DECOR.  THE STRAINS OF SCHEHERAZADE
SOFTLY FILL THE ROOM.  SUDDENLY A WHIP COMES FLASHING INTO
THE FRAME AND WHACKS AGAINST THE TORSO OF THE SLEEPING
BIALYSTOCK.

SHOT WIDENS TO REVEAL 'HOLD ME, TOUCH ME' WIELDING THE WHIP.
SHE IS DRESSED IN AN 'ARABIAN NIGHTS' COSTUME.

                         HOLD ME, TOUCH ME
            Dance!  Dance, slave!

BIALYSTOCK IS UP IN A FLASH AND INTO A QUICK TURKISH TIME
STEP SO AS TO AVOID THE DEADLY LASH.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            How's this?

                         HOLD ME, TOUCH ME
            Faster, faster, you dog.  Excite
            me, delight me.  Hold me, touch me.

CUT TO CLOSE-UP OF BIALYSTOCK'S FACE AS HE DANCES.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (murmuring to himself)
            Money is honey, money is honey.

DISSOLVE TO BIALYSTOCK'S OFFICE.  NIGHT.  BIALYSTOCK IS
SEATED AT THE DESK.  ON ONE SIDE OF HIM IS A LARGE STACK OF
SIGNED INVESTOR CONTRACTS.  ON THE OTHER AN EQUALLY LARGE
PILE OF UNSIGNED ONES.  BIALYSTOCK SIGNS FURIOUSLY, AS BLOOM
FEEDS THE CONTRACTS TO HIM.

                         BLOOM
                   (handing Bialystock contract)
            Mrs. Sarah Catheart.  She owns 50%
            of the profits.

BIALYSTOCK DUTIFULLY SIGNS.  BLOOM TAKES ANOTHER AND PLACES
IT BEFORE BIALYSTOCK.

                                                           48.


                         BLOOM
            Mrs. Eleanor Biddlecombe.  She also
            owns 50% of the profits.

BIALYSTOCK SIGNS.  BLOOM PUTS THE NEXT ONE DOWN.

                         BLOOM
            Mrs. Virginia Resnick.  She also
            owns 50% of the profits.

BIALYSTOCK SIGNS.  BLOOM TAKES ANOTHER.

                         BLOOM
            Mrs. Alma Wentworth.  She owns 100%
            of the profits.

BIALYSTOCK SIGNS.  THEN LOOKS UP AT BLOOM.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Leo, what if this play is a hit?

                         BLOOM
            Then the Department of Justice owns
            100% of Bialystock and Bloom.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (Bloom's thought
                   makes him unhappy)
            OI.  I'm depressed.  Leo, do me a
            favor.  Open the safe.  I want to
            see the money.

LEO, HUMORING HIM, SPINS THE COMBINATION DIAL ON SAFE AND
OPENS IT.

CUT TO INSIDE OF SAFE.  IT IS JAMMED FULL OF NEATLY STACKED
PILES OF MONEY.

CUT TO BIALYSTOCK ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES IN FRONT OF SAFE.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (to himself.  Inhales deeply)
            That's better.

BIALYSTOCK TAKES OUT A STACK OF NEATLY FOLDED BILLS.  HE
SMELLS IT, KISSES IT AND PUTS IT IN HIS POCKET.

                         BLOOM
            What are you doing?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I'm going to buy a toy.  I worked
            very, very hard and I think I
            deserve a toy.

                                                           49.


                         BLOOM
                   (quizzically)
            A toy?

DISSOLVE TO CLOSE-UP, FACE OF A GORGEOUS BLONDE, ULLA.
DOLLY BACK TO REVEAL THE REST OF HER.  SHE IS INCREDIBLY
WELL-ENDOWED.

CUT TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.  THEIR EYES GLUED TO HER FORM.

                         BLOOM
            That's a toy?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Yes.  She's an adult, educational
            toy made in Sweden for children
            over fifty.

BLOOM STARES AT HIM.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Stop looking at me like that.
            She's not an indulgence.  She
            happens to be our new receptionist.
            She goes with our new surroundings.

QUICKLY PAN POSH NEW WALL-PAPER, FURNISHINGS, ETC.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Ulla, I'd like you to meet my
            partner and associate, Mr. Leo Bloom.

                         ULLA
            Got dag pa dig.

                         BLOOM
            How do you do.
                   (to Bialystock)
            Have you gone mad?  A receptionist
            that can't speak English.  What
            will people say?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah,
            ooh, ooh."

                         BLOOM
            What is she gonna do here?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I'll show you.  Ulla, go to work.

                         ULLA
            Ya, sur.

                                                           50.


ULLA GOES TO PHONOGRAPH AND PLACES NEEDLE ON RECORD.  THE
DRIVING SOUND OF A TWIST FILLS THE ROOM.  ULLA SENSUOUSLY
TWISTS, VIBRATES, FRUGS, WATUSIS AND ROCKS HER BODY IN TIME
WITH MUSIC.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            See, it helps the day go by.  Ulla,
            okay.  Okay.

ULLA STOPS, GOES TO PHONOGRAPH AND TAKES NEEDLE OFF.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Go to desk.  Answer telephone.

HE PICKS UP PHONE TO SHOW HER.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Bialystock and Bloom.  Bialystock
            and Bloom.

                         ULLA
                   (repeating to herself
                   as she leaves)
            Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock
            and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum.
            Got dag pa dig.  Bialystock and Blum.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (to Bloom, opening up
                   a box on his desk)
            Hey, Blum, have a cigar.

                         BLOOM
            No thanks.

BIALYSTOCK TAKES AN ENORMOUS BLACK CIGAR.

                         BLOOM
            Max, maybe...

BIALYSTOCK REACHES UNDER HIS DESK.  PRESSES BUZZER.  WE HEAR
BUZZING SOUND IN ANTE-ROOM.

                         BLOOM
            What's that?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Nothing.  Nothing.  Go on.

ULLA ENTERS.  GOES TO DESK, PICKS UP CIGARETTE LIGHTER,
LIGHTS BIALYSTOCK'S CIGAR, KISSES HIM.

                                                           51.


                         ULLA

                   cheek)
            Min Bialystock.

ULLA LEAVES.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Nice girl.

                         BLOOM
            Max, as I was saying, maybe we
            should go easy on the spending.  I
            mean these offices and everything.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Why?  Take it when you can get it!
            Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!

                         BLOOM
            But if something should... God
            forbid... go wrong, at least we
            could give them some of their money
            back.  It would look better in court.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Stop talking like that, you white
            mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong.
            As a matter of fact, today I have
            taken steps to insure total disaster.
            At two o'clock we have an
            appointment with none other than
            Roger De Bris.

                         BLOOM
                   (searching)
            Roger De Bris.  Roger De Bris.  Oh
            yes, the director.  Is he good... I
            mean bad?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Roger De Bris is the worst director
            that ever lived.

                         BLOOM
            Do you think he'll take the job?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Only if we ask him.

BIALYSTOCK CONSULTS HIS WATCH.

                                                           52.


                         BIALYSTOCK
            Come on.  We'd better hurry.  We're
            late.

BIALYSTOCK BUZZES.  ULLA ENTERS.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Call chauffeur.  Get car.

                         ULLA
                   (smiling)
            Good.  Good.  We go Motel.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            No.  We go.

                   and himself)


                         ULLA
            You, Blum go Motel.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            No.  No Motel.  Get car.  Get car.

                         ULLA

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM CLIMB THE STEPS TO THE FRONT DOOR.
BIALYSTOCK PUSHES THE DOORBELL.  WE HEAR CHIMES.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (whispering)
            Now don't let anything he does or
            says upset you.  He's a little
            peculiar.

                         BLOOM
            What do you mean?

                                                           53.


THE DOOR OPENS.  FRAMED IN THE DOORWAY IS A THIN, STRANGE

            come in.

THEY ENTER THE VESTIBULE.  CARMEN CLOSES THE DOOR BEHIND THEM.

                         CARMEN
            How do you do.  I'm Carmen Giya, Mr.
            De Bris' private secretary.  Would
            you be so kind as to remove your
            shoes.

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM LOOK AT EACH OTHER BEWILDERED.

                         CARMEN
            White, white, white is the color of

                   a rack of slippers)
            Now, let's see, you're wearing grey.
            I would suggest the crimson.
            They're a little vivid, but your
            suit is so quiet.
                   (to Bialystock,
                   studying his mish
                   mash attire)
            Why don't you... Oh, take anything.
            Please follow me.

CARMEN LEADS THE WAY.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM SCUFF AFTER HIM.
WE FOLLOW THEM DOWN A NARROW CORRIDOR LINED WITH EXAMPLES OF
CLASSIC GREEK SCULPTURE -- EACH ONE DEPICTING NUDE MALES IN
VARIOUS POSES.

INT: ELEVATOR.

CUT TO ROGER DE BRIS' BOUDOIR SITTING ROOM.  IT IS ELEGANTLY
FEMININE.

                                                           54.


CHAISE LOUNGE, ANTIQUE MIRRORS, LOUIS XVI ARMOIRE AND
DRESSING TABLE.  FROM BEHIND AN ORNATE DRESSING SCREEN, WE
HEAR MUFFLED SOUNDS OF DISCONTENT.

                         DE BRIS
                   (from behind screen)
            I'll never get into this damned
            thing.

CUT TO BOUDOIR ENTRANCE.  CARMEN, BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ENTER.

                         CARMEN
                   (to De Bris)
            We're not alone.

DE BRIS' HEAD POPS OVER THE SCREEN.  HE IS A ONCE HANDSOME,
NOW DISSIPATED MAN IN HIS LATE FORTIES.

                         DE BRIS
            Ah, Messers Bialystock and Bloom, I
            presume.  Ha, ha, ha, forgive the
            pun.

                         BLOOM
                   (to Bialystock)
            What pun?

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (a curt whisper)
            Shut up.  He thinks he's witty.
                   (to De Bris)
            It's good to see you again, Roger.
            Did you get a chance to read
            "Springtime For Hitler?"

DE BRIS EMERGES FROM BEHIND THE SCREEN.  HE IS WEARING A
"LADY WINDERMERE'S FAN" STYLE DRESS.

                         DE BRIS
            Remarkable.  Remarkable.  A stunning
            piece of work.

                         BLOOM
                   (shocked, whispers)
            Max!  He's wearing a dress.
                   (his mouth remains open)


                         BIALYSTOCK
            Shhhhhh.

                                                           55.


                         DE BRIS
                   (continuing)
            I think it's a very important play.
            I, for one, never realized that the
            Third Reich meant Germany.  I mean
            it's drenched with historical
            goodies like that.

DE BRIS IS SUDDENLY AWARE OF BLOOM'S EXPRESSION.  (BLOOM'S
MOUTH IS STILL AGAPE.)

                         DE BRIS
            Oh, dear, you're staring at my
            dress.  I should explain.  I'm
            going to the Choreographer's Ball
            tonight.  There's a prize for the
            best costume.

                         CARMEN
                   (smugly)
            We always win.

                         DE BRIS
                   (looking in the mirror)
            I'm not so sure about tonight.  I'm
            supposed to be the Grand Duchess --
            I think I look more like Tugboat
            Annie.  What do you think?

HE PARADES BACK AND FORTH, EXECUTING SHARP TURNS LIKE A
MODEL AT A FASHION SHOW.

                         DE BRIS
            No be cruel.  Be brutal.  Be brutal.
            Because heaven knows they will.
            Well, what do you think, Mr. Bloom?

                         BLOOM
                   (very embarrassed)
            Well, it's... uh... it's nice and
            long... I mean, it's... uh... uh...
            where do you keep your wallet?

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (jumping in)
            It's gorgeous.  Absolutely gorgeous.
            You couldn't have picked a better
            color.  It brings out your eyes.
            Let's face it, Roger, that dress is
            you.

                                                           56.


                         DE BRIS
                   (his eyes flashing flirtatiously)
            Do you really think it brings out
            my eyes?

                         CARMEN
                   (irritated)
            We can't tell a thing without your
            wig.  As far as I'm concerned,
            you're only half-dressed.

                         DE BRIS
            Ummmm.  Well, if you're so worried
            about the wig, get it, o' wicked
            witch of the west.

CARMEN TURNS IN A HUFF AND LEAVES TO GET THE WIG.  DE BRIS
REACHES INTO CUT CRYSTAL CIGARETTE BOX, TAKES CIGARETTE,
TAPS IT, AND HOLDS IT FOR A LIGHT.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (in a whisper to Bloom)
            Quick, light his cigarette.  He
            likes you.

BLOOM NERVOUSLY REACHES FOR A BOOK OF MATCHES, RIPS ONE OUT
AND STRIKES IT.  IT DOESN'T LIGHT.  HE TRIES ANOTHER AND
ANOTHER.  ONE FINALLY CATCHES FIRE.  HE TRIES TO HOLD IT
STEADY, BUT HE IS TOO NERVOUS.  DE BRIS FIRMLY PLACES HIS
HAND OVER BLOOM'S TO STEADY THE FLAME.

                         DE BRIS
            Didn't I meet you on a summer cruise?

HE LIGHTS THE CIGARETTE BUT CONTINUES TO HOLD BLOOM'S HAND.

                         BLOOM
            I've... I've... never been on a
            cruise.

                         DE BRIS
            Oh, quel dommage.

CARMEN ENTERS CARRYING WIG.  HE SEES DE BRIS HOLDING BLOOM'S
HAND.

                         CARMEN
                   (snidely)
            Oh, I see we're getting acquainted.

DE BRIS DROPS BLOOM'S HAND AND TURNS ON CARMEN.

                                                           57.


                         DE BRIS
            How would you like to go back to
            teasing hair, big mouth?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Roger, do you mind if we talk a
            little business?

                         DE BRIS
            Please, please, that's what we're
            here for.
                   (to Carmen, who is
                   adjusting the wig)
            Be careful, that hurt.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I think this would be a marvelous
            opportunity for you, Roger.  Up to
            now, you've always been associated
            with musicals, and...

                         DE BRIS
            Yes.  Dopey show-girls in gooey
            gowns.  Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-
            turn-kick-turn!  It's enough to
            make you throw up!  At last a
            chance to do straight drama!  To
            deal with conflict, with inner
            truth.  Roger De Bris presents
            history.  Of course, I think we
            should add a little music.  That
            whole third act has got to go.
            They're losing the war.  It's too
            depressing.  We'll have to put
            something in there.
                   (gripped by his vision)
            Aaahghhh!  I see it!  A line of
            beautiful girls, dressed as Storm
            Troopers, black patent leather
            boots, all marching together...
            Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-turn-
            kick-turn!

                         BIALYSTOCK
            That's genius.  That's genius.
            Roger, I think I speak for Mr.
            Bloom and myself when I say that
            you're the only man in the world
            who can do justice to SPRINGTIME
            FOR HITLER.

                                                           58.


                         DE BRIS
                   (in one rush)
            Wait a minute.  This is a very big
            decision.  It might effect the
            course of my entire life.  I'll
            have to think about it.  I'll do it.

DE BRIS EXTENDS HIS HAND.  BIALYSTOCK SHAKES IT.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Congratulations.

                         DE BRIS
                   (to Carmen)
            Get on the phone.  Send out a
            casting call.  Call every agent in
            town.  I want to see everybody.
            Everybody.

DISSOLVE TO STAGE DOOR OF BROADWAY THEATRE.  DAY.  SIGN ON
DOOR READS:  CASTING TODAY -- SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER.

QUICK DISSOLVE TO INTERIOR OF THEATRE.  THE PLACE IS A
MADHOUSE.  HUNDREDS OF WOULD-BE HITLERS FILL THE STAGE.
EACH AND EVERY ONE WITH THE FUHRER'S HAIRCUT AND LITTLE
SQUARE MUSTACHE.  THERE ARE TALL HITLERS, SHORT HITLERS, FAT
HITLERS, SKINNY HITLERS, METHOD HITLERS, SHAKESPEAREAN
HITLERS, ALL KINDS HITLERS.

CUT TO FIRST ROW OF AUDIENCE.  SEATED THERE, WATCHING THE
BEDLAM, ARE BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM, DE BRIS, CARMEN GIYA AND
FRANZ LIEBKIND.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (looking for the
                   least likely Hitler)
            Roger, what about that one?  The
            fat Hitler on the right?

                         DE BRIS
            I don't know.  I rather fancy that
            one.

CUT TO BEAUTIFUL, BLOND, MUSCULAR, YOUNG MAN, WHO LOOKS AS
IF HE IS POSING FOR "BODY BEAUTIFUL." HE BEARS NOT THE
SLIGHTEST RESEMBLANCE TO HITLER EVEN THOUGH HE DOES SPORT A
LITTLE BLACK MUSTACHE.

CUT BACK TO BIALYSTOCK.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Not bad.  Not bad.  What do you
            think, Franz?

                                                           59.


                         LIEBKIND
                   (very emotional)
            I don't know.  I don't know.  For
            some strange reason, I'm deeply
            moved.
                   (he wipes away a tear)


                         DE BRIS
                   (getting to his feet)
            Oh, this is bedlam, bedlam.  We
            must have some order.

DE BRIS, FOLLOWED BY CARMEN, HOPS TO THE STAGE AND ADDRESSES
THE MILLING MOB.

                         DE BRIS
                   (clapping his hands
                   for attention)
            Will all the dancing Hitlers please
            wait in the wings.  We're only
            taking the singing Hitlers.

AS THE DANCING HITLERS LEAVE THE STAGE, CARMEN ARRANGES THE
SINGING HITLERS SO THAT THEY ARE IN A LONG STRAIGHT LINE
AGAINST THE BACK OF THE STAGE WALL.  CARMEN READS OUT A NAME
AND THE FIRST SINGING HITLER WALKS DOWNSTAGE TO AUDITION.
EXCEPT FOR A SPORTY LITTLE HITLER MUSTACHE, HE BEARS LITTLE
RESEMBLANCE TO THE FUHRER.

                         CARMEN
            Arthur Packard.

                         DE BRIS
            Hello, Arthur.  Tell us something
            about yourself.

                         ARTHUR PACKARD
                   (in a strangulated
                   tenor's voice)
            I was the lead tenor of the
            Albuquerque Opera Company for two
            seasons.  I just finished a road
            tour of STUDENT PRINCE.  And last
            season I was up for the lead in the
            Broadway production of Circus Man.

                         DE BRIS
            What happened?

                         ARTHUR PACKARD
            I didn't get it.

                                                           60.


                         DE BRIS
            What are you going to sing for us
            Arthur?

AS ARTHUR TELLS HIM THE TITLE OF HIS SONG, DE BRIS MOUTHS IT
WORD FOR WORD TOWARD HIS FRIEND, CARMEN.

                   (sings)
            My boy Bill will be strong and as
            tall as a...

                         DE BRIS
            Thank you.

ARTHUR SHRUGS AND LEAVES THE STAGE.

                         DE BRIS

            Jason Green.

JASON GREEN COMES DOWNSTAGE.  HE IS A BIG, BARREL-CHESTED
MAN.  HE ALSO WEARS HITLER-TYPE MUSTACHE.

                         DE BRIS
            Well, Jason, what have you been
            doing lately?

                         JASON GREEN
                   (in basso profundo)
            For the last sixteen years, I've
            been touring with "Naughty Marietta."

                         DE BRIS
            Good.  And what are you going to
            sing for us, Jason?

AS JASON TELLS HIM THE SONG'S TITLE, DE BRIS ONCE AGAIN
MOUTHS IT WORD FOR WORD WITH HIM.

                         JASON GREEN
            "Stout-hearted Men."

            Who are stout-hearted men
            Who will fight for the right they
            adore."

                         DE BRIS

            more."

                         DE BRIS

CUT TO CARMEN GIYA ON STAGE.  IT IS NOW EMPTY.

                         CARMEN
            Well, that's it.

CUT TO FIRST ROW OF AUDIENCE.  SLOW PAN BIALYSTOCK, BLOOM,
DE BRIS, AD LIEBKIND.  THEY ARE TIRED, DISHEVELED AND UNHAPPY.

                         BLOOM
            I think that's enough Hitlers for
            one day.  Maybe we'll get lucky
            tomorrow.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            You think out of all those Hitlers
            you could find just one...

                         LIEBKIND
            It was the same thing in Germany.
            We looked for years before we found
            the right Hitler.

FROM OFF-STAGE WE HEAR THE SHARP CLICK OF BOOTS APPROACHING.
ALL EYES TURN TOWARD THE STAGE.  FROM OUT OF THE WINGS STEPS

A YOUNG PERSON IN A LEATHER DOUBLET, HIGH LEATHER BOOTS, AND
EXTREMELY LONG HAIR.  IT CARRIES A GUITAR.  UNTIL IT SPEAKS,
WE ARE NOT SURE WHETHER IT IS A YOUNG MAN OR A YOUNG WOMAN.
(LORENZO ST. DU BOIS)

                         LSD
            Hey, man.

                         CARMEN
            I beg your pardon.

                         LSD
            Is this where they're auditioning
            Boomerang?

                         CARMEN
                   (studying him coldly)
            No, I'm afraid you've wandered into
            the wrong theatre.

                         LSD
                   (to himself, as he
                   starts to leave)
            Man, freaked out again.

                                                           63.


                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (leaping to his feet)
            Wait!  This is Boomerang.  This is
            Boomerang.

                         DE BRIS
                   (to Bialystock)
            What are you saying?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Let's hear him.  What have we got
            to lose?
                   (to LSD)
            What's your name?

                         LSD
            Lorenzo Saint DuBois.  But everybody
            calls me LSD.

                         DE BRIS
            What have you done, LSD?

                         LSD
            Six months, I'm out on probation,
            but it's cool now, baby.

                         DE BRIS
            I mean in show business.

                         LSD
            Oh, in show business.  Well, let's
            put it this way, my next job will
            be my debut.

                         DE BRIS
            What do you do best?

                         LSD
            Hey, man, I can't do that here,
            that's what they put me away for.

                         DE BRIS
            Oh, sing.  Sing!

                         LSD
            Hey, baby, that's where they put
            me, Sing-Sing.  How'd you know
            that, you been up?

                         DE BRIS
                   (a little hysterical)
            Sing a song!  Just sing a song!

                                                           64.


                         LSD
            Here's a little thing I think
            you're going to see on the charts
            any day.  I wrote it last night in
            my sleep.  It's a Hindu Zen Folk
            Rock Ballad.

LSD SINGS "I'M THE VICTIM OF A MULTI-MYSTIC FREAK-OUT." THE
SONG IS GEARED TO THE AU COURANT "RAGA ROCK" BEAT.  PHRASES
SUCH AS, "CONNECT WITH THE INFINITE" AND "TURN ON THE
WORLD." LORENZO FINISHES THE NUMBER.

CUT TO BIALYSTOCK, BLOOM, LIEBKIND AND DE BRIS.  THEY ARE
STUNNED.  BIALYSTOCK IS THE FIRST TO RECOVER.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (shouting)
            That's our Hitler!

                         LIEBKIND
                   (howls of despair)
            Vaaaat???

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (quickly)
            Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a
            man of his time.  This is a man of
            his time.

                         LIEBKIND
            But he has long hair!

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Don't look at the outside, look at
            the inside.  It's the inner Hitler
            we're after.  The young beautiful
            Hitler, who danced his way to glory.

                         LIEBKIND
            I don't know.  I don't know.

                         DE BRIS
                   (he has been studying
                   LSD intensely)
            Could be an exciting piece of off-
            beat casting.  Of course, we'd have
            to do something about that coiffure.

                         LIEBKIND
            But he's so crazy, he's so sloppy,
            he's so... so... American!

                                                           65.


                         BIALYSTOCK
            Franz, trust me.  I promise I won't
            let you down.

                         LIEBKIND
            All right, but remember, if you
            damage the Fuhrer's reputation, I
            kill you.

DISSOLVE TO MARQUEE OF BROADWAY THEATRE.  MARQUEE READS:
OPENING TONIGHT - SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER.  Directed by ROGER
DE BRIS.

PAN DOWN TO THEATRE ENTRANCE.  THE SIDEWALK IS CHOKED WITH
OPENING NIGHTERS, ALL AGLITTER IN DIAMONDS, FURS AND ELEGANT
TUXEDOS.  LUXURIOUS BLACK LIMOUSINES PULL UP TO THE CURB,
DEPOSITING THEIR RICH CONTENTS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE
LITTLE OLD LADIES.

CUT TO LOBBY.  THERE IN THE MIDST OF THE SWIRLING CONFUSION
STAND BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM IN THEIR OPENING NIGHT TAILS.
BIALYSTOCK IS RESPLENDENT IN A BLACK SILK CAPE, LINED IN
CRIMSON SATIN.  BLOOM'S TAILS ARE OBVIOUSLY RENTED.  THEY
ARE NEAR THE TICKET TAKER.  AS SOME OF THE OPENING NIGHT
"SUPPORTERS" ENTER THE THEATRE, THEY SHOUT ENCOURAGEMENTS TO
BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.  TO EACH OF THE WELL-WISHERS,
BIALYSTOCK RESPONDS WITH A SMILE AND A MUMBLE.  THEY GET THE
SMILE, WE HEAR THE MUMBLE.

                         FIRST WELL-WISHER
                   (a silver-haired
                   gentleman in his late fifties)
            Good luck, Max, I hope it's a big
            hit.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (mumbling)
            Bite your tongue.

                         SECOND WELL-WISHER
                   (a little old lady)
            We're gonna do it this time, Bialy,
            I just know it.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I hope you lose your bloomers.

                         THIRD WELL-WISHER
                   (another old lady)
            My prayers go with you, Bialy.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            God Forbid.

                                                           66.


CUT TO LIMOUSINE PULLING UP IN FRONT OF THEATRE.  DOORMAN
OPENS DOOR, ASSISTS RICH COUPLE OUT OF CAR.  LIMOUSINE PULLS
AWAY.  A MOTORCYCLE WITH SIDE-CAR ROARS UP TO FRONT OF
THEATRE.  AT THE HANDLEBARS, BEAUTIFULLY DECKED OUT IN
TUXEDO AND HIS EVER POPULAR GERMAN HELMET IS FRANZ LIEBKIND.

CAMERA FOLLOWS LIEBKIND AS HE ENTERS LOBBY.  HE MAKES HIS
WAY THROUGH THE MILLING THRONG TOWARD BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (to Bialystock and
                   Bloom, very seriously)
            Gentlemen, this is a very momentous
            moment.

HE CLICKS HIS HEELS AND SHAKES HANDS WITH EACH OF THEM.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (to Bloom)
            Good luck.
                   (to Bialystock)
            Good luck.

HE STARTS INTO THEATRE, STOPS, TURNS BACK TO BIALYSTOCK AND
BLOOM.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (a mad gleam in his eye)
            Tonight, New York.  Tomorrow, the
            world!

HE TURNS TRIUMPHANTLY AND ENTERS THE THEATRE.

                         OFF-CAMERA VOICE (GIRL)
            Check your hat?

                         LIEBKIND
                   (off camera)
            No!!

                         BIALYSTOCK
            So much for Nutsy Fagin.

                         BLOOM
                   (nudging Bialystock, whispers)
            Here comes the Times Drama Critic.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Watch closely, as Bialystock drives
            the last nail into the coffin.

BIALYSTOCK AMBLES OVER TO THE TIMES CRITIC, WHO HAS STOPPED
TO CHAT WITH SOME PEOPLE.

                                                           67.


                         BIALYSTOCK
            Always delighted to see the
            gentlemen of the press.  There you
            are, sir.  Two on the aisle,
            compliments of the management.
                   (he smiles unctuously)


                         DRAMA CRITIC
                   (haughtily accepting tickets)
            Thank you.  Here, wait a minute.
            There seems to be some mistake.
            There's a hundred dollar bill
            wrapped around these tickets.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (conspiratorially)
            It's no mistake.  Enjoy the show.

                         DRAMA CRITIC
                   (outraged)
            Mr. Bialystock, just what do you
            think you're doing?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I'm bribing you.  And if you play
            ball, there's a lot more where that
            came from.

BIALYSTOCK WINKS AND SAUNTERS OFF.

                         DRAMA CRITIC
                   (blustering with rage)
            I... I... I... How dare he!  I've
            never been so insulted in my life!
            The gall of the man!  The incredible
            gall of the man!  I'll fix his wagon.

THE CRITIC STALKS INTO THE THEATRE.  AS HE PASSES BIALYSTOCK,
HE CONTEMPTUOUSLY FLINGS THE HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL TO THE
FLOOR.  HE DISAPPEARS THROUGH THE DOOR.

                         OFF-CAMERA VOICE (GIRL)
            Check your hat?

                         DRAMA CRITIC
                   (off camera)
            No!!

BIALYSTOCK REACHES DOWN, PICKS UP CRUMPLED DOLLAR BILL,
STRAIGHTENS IT OUT, PUTS IT IN HIS POCKET.

                                                           68.


                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (grinning like a
                   Cheshire cat)
            Heh, heh, heh.  He'll kill us.

FROM INSIDE THE THEATRE, WE HEAR THE OVERTURE BEGINNING.
LIGHTS IN THE LOBBY BLINK.

                         BLOOM
            Come on, they've started the
            overture.

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ENTER THE THEATRE.

CUT TO REVERSE ANGLE.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ENTERING DARKENED
THEATRE.  THEY TAKE POSITIONS AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE.
BLOOM EXTENDS HIS HAND TO BIALYSTOCK.  HE INTENDS TO SPEAK
IN A CONFIDENT AND CONTROLLED MANNER BUT WHAT COMES OUT IS
AN HYSTERICAL SHRIEK.

                         BLOOM
                   (casually shrieking)
            Well, Max, this is it!!!

HE SCARES HIMSELF AND QUICKLY CLAPS HIS HANDS OVER HIS MOUTH.

                         BLOOM
                   (whispers)
            I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Relax, in two hours our worries
            will be over.

CUT TO STAGE.  AS THE OVERTURE IS CONCLUDED, THE CURTAIN
SLOWLY RISES.  ON STAGE THERE IS A LINE OF GIRLS DRESSED IN
SEXY STORM TROOPER COSTUMES--BLACK PATENT LEATHER BOOTS, ETC.
THEIR ARMS ARE LINKED ABOUT ONE ANOTHER AS THEY DANCE AND
KICK IN RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL ROCKETTE FASHION.

                         STORM TROOPER CHORUS
                   (singing)
            Germany was having trouble,
            What a sad, sad story.
            Needed a new leader
            To restore its former glory.
            Where, oh, where was he,
            Who could that man be,
            We looked around,
            And then we found,
            The man for you and me,
            And now its...

                                                           69.


THE STORM TROOPER ROCKETTES PART AND FROM ABOVE THEM,
DESCENDING TWIN STAIRCASES, WE SEE TWO LINES OF BEAUTIFUL
SHOWGIRLS, HOLDING HUGE BALLOONS ABOVE THEIR HEADS.  ON EACH
BALLOON IS PAINTED A PICTURE OF THE FUHRER.  EVERYONE SINGS
AS THEY DESCEND.

                         ENTIRE CHORUS
                   (singing)
            "Springtime for Hitler," etc.

CUT TO AUDIENCE.  NUMBER ON STAGE CONTINUES.

CLOSE-UP OF MAN AND WOMAN ON AISLE.

                         WOMAN (DOWAGER)
            This is shocking!

CUT TO ANOTHER AREA OF AUDIENCE.  ANOTHER COUPLE.

                         MAN (STUFFED SHIRT)
            Outrageous!

CUT TO CRITIC ON THE AISLE, BIALYSTOCK'S P.O.V.  HE SCOWLS
AS HE FURIOUSLY MAKES NOTES.

CUT TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM AT BACK OF THEATRE.  THEY ARE
SMILING.  BIALYSTOCK POINTS TO COUPLE WHO HAVE LEFT THEIR
SEATS AND STARTED UP THE AISLE.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Ahhhhh, it's going better than I
            expected.

THE COUPLE COMES ABREAST OF BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.

                         WOMAN
                   (to man as they exit theatre)
            Well, talk about bad taste.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (he chuckles as they leave)
            Come, let us repair to the bar
            across the street.  I don't want to
            be caught here during intermission.
            We'll be stoned to death.

THEY LINK ARMS AND MERRILY MARCH OUT OF THE THEATRE.

CUT TO STAGE.  "SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER" OPENING IS ENDING IN
A GREAT CRESCENDO OF PATRIOTIC INSANITY.

                                                           70.


                         ENTIRE CHORUS
                   (singing)
            So Springtime for Hitler,
            Is Springtime for Goering,
            Is Springtime for Goebbels,
            Is Springtime for Himmler,
            Is Springtime for you and me!!

CURTAIN FALLS.  THE NUMBER IS RECEIVED BY THE AUDIENCE WITH
HUSHED SILENCE.  FOLLOWED BY A SURGE TOWARD THE DOORS.  THE
AISLES ARE CHOKED WITH UNHAPPY PEOPLE, WHO CAN'T WAIT TO GET
OUT.

CURTAIN RISES.  ON STAGE ARE EVA BRAUN AND HITLER (LSD).
EVA BRAUN IS A FETCHING BLONDE IN LONG BRAIDS.  LSD IS
PACING UP AND DOWN.  EVA BRAUN SITS ON LOVE SEAT DOWNSTAGE.
IN HER HAND IS AN OVERSIZED DAISY.  AS SHE PULLS THE PETALS
FROM IT, SHE WHINES.  SHE HAS A PRONOUNCED AMERICAN ACCENT.

                         EVA
            Er liebt mir.  Er liebt mir nicht.
            Er liebt mir.
                   (the last petal)
            Er liebt mir nicht.

CUT TO PEOPLE IN AISLE.  THEY HAVE NOTICEABLY SLOWED DOWN.
SOME ARE WALKING BACKWARDS.  THEY ARE INTRIGUED.

CUT BACK TO STAGE.

                         EVA
                   (turns to LSD)
            Du liebt mir nicht!

                         LSD
                   (protesting vehemently)
            I lieb you baby, I lieb you.  You
            know that.

                         EVA
            If you lieb me, why are you leaving
            me?

                         LSD
            Hey, man, I can't spend all my time
            with you.  I took an oath, baby,
            Deutschland uber alles.

CUT TO AUDIENCE IN AISLES.  THEY HAVE ALL STOPPED LEAVING TO
TURN AND WATCH.  SOME BEGIN TO LAUGH AND OTHERS APPLAUD.
THEY LIKE LSD.

                                                           71.


                         MAN
            That's Hitler?  I get it!  It's a
            put-on.

CUT TO WOMAN.

                         WOMAN
            Hey, Harry, he's funny.

NOW THERE IS A MAD RUSH TO REGAIN THEIR SEATS.

CUT TO INTERIOR BAR.  IT IS EMPTY EXCEPT FOR THE BARTENDER
AND A DRUNK AT THE FAR END OF THE BAR.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM
ARE SEATED ON STOOLS AT THE BAR.  THEY CLINK GLASSES.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Here's to the one and only
            performance of "Springtime for
            Hitler."

THEY BOTH LAUGH AND DOWN THEIR DRINKS.  BIALYSTOCK RAPS ON
THE BAR WITH HIS CANE.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Innkeeper, innkeeper, another round
            of drinks here.  As a matter of
            fact, a round of drinks for
            everybody in the place!

BARTENDER LOOKS AROUND AT THE ALMOST EMPTY BARROOM.  DOES A
LITTLE TAKE.  HE THEN REPLENISHES THEIR DRINKS AND PLACES A
GLASS IN FRONT OF THE DRUNK.  THE DRUNK TIPS HIS HAT
GRACIOUSLY TOWARDS BIALYSTOCK.

                         BLOOM
            Just think, yesterday I was a
            meaningless little accountant --
            and today, I am the producer of a
            Broadway flop!

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (raising his glass)
            To failure!

                         BLOOM
            To failure!

                         DRUNK
                   (blushing)
            Oh, thank you!  It's very kind of
            you.
                   (raises his glass and
                   downs his drink)
                         (MORE)

                                                           72.


                         DRUNK (CONT'D)


CUT BACK TO STAGE.  SAME SCENE.  EVA STARTS TO CRY.

                         EVA
            If the Duke of Windsor could give
            up the Throne of England for the
            woman he loved, why can't you?

                         LSD
            It's different.  I'm a tyrant, baby.

AUDIENCE LAUGHS.

CUT TO FRANZ LIEBKIND SEATED IN AN AISLE SEAT.  HE NERVOUSLY
PINCHES HIS FACE AS HE SEMI-COHERENTLY MUMBLES TO HIMSELF.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (becoming slightly unhinged)
            Baby, why does he keep saying baby?
            I didn't write baby.  The Fuhrer
            never said baby.  Vat is it vit
            this baby?

                         WOMAN IN ADJOINING SEAT
                   (very annoyed)
            Will you shut up!

                         LIEBKIND
            You shut up!  I'm the author.
            You're just the audience.  I
            outrank you.

CUT TO BAR.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ARE A LITTLE TIPSY.  BY
NOW THE DRUNK HAS JOINED THEM AND ALL THREE ARE GOOD PALS.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Bartender, bartender, another drink
            for myself and my associate, Mr.
            Bloom.  And don't forget our good-
            natured inebriate over there.

DRUNK TIPS HIS HAT GRACIOUSLY.

                         DRUNK
            Eternally grateful.  Sincerely
            yours, Oliver Wendell Drunk.

DURING DRUNK'S SPEECH, BARTENDER HAS REFILLED THEIR GLASSES.
HE STANDS BACK, WATCHING THEM AS HE DRIES GLASSES.

                                                           73.


                         DRUNK
                   (raises his glass)
            A toast!

                         BLOOM
            To what?

                         DRUNK
                   (stumped)
            To... toast!  I love toast.

                         BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM
            To toast.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (smacking his glass
                   down on the bar)
            Now I'll take the lead and I want
            you right behind me all the way!
            One... two... three!
                   (singing)
            "By the light,

                         BLOOM AND DRUNK
                   (singing)
            "By the light, by the light,

                         BIALYSTOCK
            "Of the silvery moon,

                         BLOOM AND DRUNK
            "Of the silvery mooooon,

                         BIALYSTOCK
            "I want to croon,

                         BLOOM AND DRUNK
            "He wants to croon, he wants to
            croon,

                         BIALYSTOCK
            "To my honey I'll croon,

                         BLOOM AND DRUNK
            "He's gonna croon love's tune,

                         BIALYSTOCK
            "Honeymoon,

                         BLOOM AND DRUNK
            "Honeymoon, honeymoon,

                         BIALYSTOCK
            "Keep a shining in...

                                                           74.


BIALYSTOCK STOPS ABRUPTLY.  HE POINTS TOWARD THE DOOR.  WE
HEAR THE SOUND OF PEOPLE ENTERING THE BAR.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Intermission!  Quick, hide your
            face.  They'll tear us to pieces.

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM HOP ON THEIR STOOLS AND COVER THEIR
FACES WITH THEIR HANDS.  THE DRUNK SHRUGS, HOPS ON THE STOOL
NEXT TO THEM AND ALSO HIDES HIS FACE.  A HORDE OF FIRST
NIGHTERS SWEEPS INTO THE BAR.  THEY ARE ALL AROUND
BIALYSTOCK, BLOOM AND THE DRUNK, CLAMORING FOR DRINKS.

                         CROWD
                   (ad-lib)
            "Scotch on the rocks,"
            "Bourbon and soda."
            "Two martinis."
            "Whiskey sour."

THE CROWD IS VERY CHEERFUL.  THEY ARE STILL BUBBLING FROM
THE FIRST ACT.

                         WOMAN
                   (to her escort)
            Well, so far that's about the
            funniest thing I've ever seen on
            Broadway.

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM LOOK AT EACH OTHER.

                         WOMAN'S ESCORT
            Never laughed so much in my life.

                         MAN
                   (to his friend)
            Hysterical, absolutely hysterical.

                         MAN'S FRIEND
            I thought I'd split my sides.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Take it easy, don't panic.  There
            are a lot of plays on this street.
            They are not necessarily talking
            about "Springtime For Hitler."

                         HUSBAND
                   (to his wife)
            Honey, I never in a million years
            thought I'd ever love a show called
            "Springtime For Hitler."

                                                           75.


BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM FREEZE.  A LITTLE OLD LADY COMES UP
BEHIND BIALYSTOCK.  SHE RAPS HIM ON THE BACK WITH HER
UMBRELLA.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY #8
            Bialy, you sly fox, you've done it.
            It's a smasheroo.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (in a daze)
            Smasheroo.  Smasheroo.

THE CROWD STARTS TO LEAVE.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
            Oh, I'd better hurry back.  I don't
            want to miss one minute of it.

THE FIRST NIGHTERS LEAVE THE BAR.  ALL THAT REMAIN ARE
BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM, THE BARTENDER AND THE DRUNK.
BIALYSTOCK SLIPS OFF THE STOOL AND WANDERS TO MIDDLE OF
BARROOM.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (dazed)
            Got to think... Got to think... Got
            to think... Got to think... Got to
            think...

CUT TO BLOOM AT THE BAR, FROZEN, STARING STRAIGHT AHEAD.
HIS EYES ARE GLAZED WITH SHOCK.  HE STROKES HIS CHEEK WITH
HIS LITTLE BLUE BLANKET.

                         BLOOM
            Mrs. Cathcart -- 50%
            Mrs. Biddlecombe -- 50%
            Mrs. Wentworth -- 50%
            Mrs. Resnick -- 100%

THE DRUNK STARES FROM ONE TO THE OTHER.  UNHAPPY WITH THEIR
PRESENT MOOD, HE DECIDES TO LIVEN THINGS UP AGAIN.  HE
TIPTOES OVER TO BIALYSTOCK, PUTS HIS ARMS AROUND BIALYSTOCK'S
WAIST, ROCKS BACK AND FORTH AND BEGINS TO SING.

                         DRUNK
                   (singing)
            "By the light...
            By the light, by the light...
            Of the silvery...

BIALYSTOCK PICKS HIM UP AND THROWS HIM ACROSS THE BAR.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Get away from me, you drunken bum!

                                                           76.


DRUNK PICKS HIMSELF UP AND DUSTS HIMSELF OFF.

                         DRUNK
                   (indignantly)
            Fairweather friend!

THE DRUNK STAGGERS OUT OF THE BAR.  BIALYSTOCK GETS A HOLD
OF HIMSELF.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Maybe it's not true!

BIALYSTOCK RUSHES OVER TO BLOOM.

                         BLOOM
                   (still mumbling to himself)
            No way out.  No way out.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true.

BLOOM DOES NOT RESPOND.  BIALYSTOCK SHAKES HIM.

                         BLOOM
                   (droning monotonously)
            No way out.  No way out.  What?  Who?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Why don't we go over to the theatre
            and see what's really happening?
            After all, we've only heard from a
            small portion of the audience.
            Let's hear what the majority thinks.

                         BLOOM
                   (in a trance)
            The majority.  The majority.  Yes.
            Let's hear from the majority.

THEY START TO LEAVE.

DISSOLVE TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ENTERING LOBBY OF THEATRE.
AS THEY OPEN DOOR TO THEATRE, THEY ARE GREETED BY A SHOCK
WAVE OF LAUGHTER.  THEY PAUSE STRICKEN.

                         BLOOM
            I don't want to go in.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Come, we have to.

THEY TAKE EACH OTHER'S HANDS LIKE TWO FRIGHTENED LITTLE BOYS
AND CAUTIOUSLY WALK IN.

                                                           77.


CUT TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM AS THEY ENTER.  THEY TAKE THEIR
POSITIONS AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE AND WATCH THE PROCEEDINGS
MEEKLY, LIKE TWO LAMBS AWAITING THE SLAUGHTER.

CUT TO STAGE.  HITLER HAS OBVIOUSLY CALLED A COUNCIL OF WAR.
THE FUHRER IS SURROUNDED BY HIS GENERAL STAFF.

                         GENERAL
                   (making a report)
            We are falling back on all fronts.
            Our soldiers are retreating.

                         LSD
            No good, baby, no good.  You heard
            my orders.  Nobody retreats.
            Attack!  Attack!

                         GENERAL
            Who can we attack?  They're all too
            big.

                         LSD
                   (getting an inspiration)
            Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!

                         GENERAL
            We can't... we keep our money there!

CUT BACK TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.  THEY STARE STRAIGHT
AHEAD, STONY-FACED.  HUGE TEARS WELL UP IN THEIR EYES AND
RUN DOWN THEIR CHEEKS.

CUT TO LIEBKIND.  HE HAS RIPPED OFF THE ARM OF HIS CHAIR AND
IS EARNESTLY GNAWING AT IT.

                         LIEBKIND
            Baby, again with that baby.  There
            must be no more babies.

LIEBKIND LEAPS FROM HIS SEAT AND HEADS TOWARD THE SIDE
ENTRANCE LEADING TO THE STAGE.

CUT BACK TO STAGE.

                         LSD
            Where's Goebbels?  Where's my
            little Joe?

                         GENERAL
                   (to the wings)
            Send for Goebbels.

                                                           78.


                         LSD
            He's the only cat left that still
            grooves me.

GOEBBELS ENTERS LAUGHING.

                         GOEBBELS
            Heil, baby!  I just finished the
            morning propaganda broadcasts.

                         LSD
            What did you tell the people?

                         GOEBBELS
            I told them we invaded England.

                         LSD
            Hey, baby, that's good!  How'd we
            come out?

                         GOEBBELS
            We won.

                         LSD
            Groovy!

THEY SMACK HANDS.

LAUGH FROM AUDIENCE.

CUT TO BACKSTAGE.  LIEBKIND COMES CHARGING IN LIKE A LUNATIC.

                         LIEBKIND
            Bring down the curtain!  Bring down
            the curtain!

HE RUSHES FOR THE CURTAIN ROPE.  A STAGEHAND ATTEMPTS TO
STOP HIM.  HE RIPS OFF HIS HELMET AND BANGS HIM OVER THE
HEAD WITH IT.  AS HE SLUMPS TO THE GROUND, LIEBKIND UNDOES
THE CURTAIN ROPE.

CUT TO ACTORS ON STAGE.

                         LSD
            Goebbels, you're the only one...

THE CURTAIN DROPS WITH A THUD.  FROM BENEATH IT CRAWLS
LIEBKIND.  HE JUMPS UP AND ADDRESSES THE AUDIENCE.

                         LIEBKIND
            I am the author of this play.  You
            are the victims of a hoax.  These
            are not my words.  The Fuhrer never
            said baby.  The Fuhrer was sweet,
            the Fuhrer was kind, the Fuhrer was
            good.

                                                           79.


                         STAGE MANAGER
                   (off camera)
            Get that curtain up.

CURTAIN STARTS TO RISE.  LIEBKIND HURLS HIMSELF IT, AND
HOLDS IT DOWN.

                         LIEBKIND
            NO!  No!  The curtain must not go up!

DESPITE HIS EFFORTS, THE CURTAIN SLOWLY RISES.  LIEBKIND
DOES NOT RELEASE HIS HOLD ON IT.  HE STARTS TO GO UP.

                         LIEBKIND
            Stop!  Stop!

AS THE CURTAIN RISES, WE SEE A BEWILDERED GROUP OF ACTORS
AND STAGE HANDS WATCHING LIEBKIND'S ASCENT.  THE AUDIENCE,
THINKING LIEBKIND'S BEHAVIOR PART OF THE SHOW, ENJOYS THE
PROCEEDINGS TREMENDOUSLY.  THEY BREAK INTO APPLAUSE.

CUT TO CRITIC.  HE IS LAUGHING UPROARIOUSLY AND TEARING UP
HIS NOTES.

CUT BACK TO LIEBKIND.

                         LIEBKIND
            We have been betrayed!  I will
            return!  I will returnnnnn...

LIEBKIND DISAPPEARS INTO THE FLIES.

DISSOLVE TO ANTEROOM OF BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM'S OFFICE.  DAY.
ULLA, WEARING A BELTED RAINCOAT, SITS AT THE TYPEWRITER.
MUSIC FROM A RECORD PLAYER SOFTLY ROCKS IN THE BACKGROUND.
IN HER LEFT HAND SHE HOLDS A GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE, FROM WHICH
SHE SIPS, WHILE HER RIGHT HAND, INDEX FINGER EXTENDED, STABS
AT THE FUNNY LITTLE KEYS.  SHE IS HAPPY, IT IS THE RIGHT ONE.
THE DOOR FLIES OPEN.  THE DESPERATE BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM
ENTER.  ULLA LEAPS UP, QUICKLY UNDOES HER RAINCOAT, EXPOSING
HER DELICIOUS BODY, CLOTHED ONLY IN BLACK LACE UNDERTHINGS.

                         ULLA
            We make love?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            No!  No!  We don't make love.  Go
            to work.

ULLA IMMEDIATELY TURNS UP RECORD PLAYER TO A CRASHING BLARE
AND DOES HER GROOVY DANCE.  BIALYSTOCK HOWLS IN DESPAIR AND
FLEES INTO HIS OFFICE TOGETHER WITH BLOOM.

                                                           80.


HE CLOSES THE DOOR, SHUTTING OUT THE NOISE.  THE OFFICE IS
FILLED WITH FLOWERS AND CONGRATULATORY TELEGRAMS.  BIALYSTOCK
SWOOPS DOWN ON THE TELEGRAMS.  HE RIPS ONE OPEN AND BEGINS
READING.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            "Congratulations.  It's the biggest
            hit on Broadway."

HE TEARS IT UP AND THROWS IT AWAY.  HE PICKS UP ANOTHER AND
READS.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            "Congratulations.  Hitler will run
            forever."

HE THROWS IT AWAY.  BIALYSTOCK ATTACKS THE PILE OF TELEGRAMS.
WITHOUT OPENING THEM UP, HE TEARS THEM ONE AT A TIME.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (boiling with rage)
            Congratulations!

HE TEARS TELEGRAM.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Congratulations!

HE TEARS TELEGRAM.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Congratulations!

HE TEARS TELEGRAM.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Congratulations!

HE TEARS TELEGRAM.

THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN.  POSED IN THE DOORWAY IS ROGER DE BRIS.
IN ONE HAND HE CARRIES AN OPEN, BUBBLING MAGNUM OF CHAMPAGNE.

                         DE BRIS
                   (ecstatic)
            Congratulations!  Have you seen the
            reviews?  Have you seen the lines
            at the box office?  It's a torrent,
            it's an avalanche, it's the biggest
            hit on Broadway!

HE STARTS INTO THE ROOM.  BIALYSTOCK GROWLS AND LUNGES AT HIM.

                                                           81.


                         BIALYSTOCK
            You lousy fruit.  You've ruined me!

HE SMASHES DE BRIS UP AGAINST THE WALL.  THE CHAMPAGNE GOES
FLYING.

                         DE BRIS
                   (shrieking)
            Help!  Help!  He's crazy!  He's
            going to kill me.  Call the police!
            Call the police!  Help, help,
            murder, murder, rape, rape!!!

BIALYSTOCK THROWS HIM OUT, SLAMS THE DOOR AND LOCKS IT.  HE
FALLS INTO THE CHAIR AND PUTS HIS FEET UP ON THE DESK.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (moaning)
            How could this happen?  I was so
            careful.  I picked the wrong play,
            the wrong director, the wrong cast.
            Where did I go right?  We forgot
            one important, Bloom.  Adolf Hitler
            always drew a crowd.

BIALYSTOCK IS SUDDENLY AWARE THAT BLOOM IS DOING STRANGE
THINGS AT THE NEXT DESK.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            What are you doing?

CUT TO BLOOM.  HE IS FEVERISHLY PILING LEDGERS AND ACCOUNT
BOOKS TOGETHER.  HE SWOOPS THEM UP IN HIS ARMS, CLUTCHES
THEM TIGHTLY AND BEGINS BACKING TOWARDS THE DOOR.

                         BLOOM
                   (defensively)
            Don't try to stop me.  I've made up
            my mind.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            What are you doing with those books?
            Where are you going?

                         BLOOM
                   (with hysterical conviction)
            I'm turning myself in.  It's the
            only way.  I'm going to cooperate
            with the authorities.  They'll
            reduce my sentence and then there's
            time off for good behavior.  And
            maybe I'll get a job in the prison
            library.  So long.

                                                           82.


HE TURNS THE KNOB.  THE DOOR IS LOCKED.  HE FIDDLES WITH THE
CATCH.  TOO LATE!  BIALYSTOCK IS UP AND AT HIM IN A FLASH.
HE BLOCKS THE DOOR.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (reasonably)
            Leo, take it easy.  Relax, you're
            overwrought.  You don't know what
            you're doing.  You're acting out of
            panic... GIMME THOSE BOOKS!

BIALYSTOCK LUNGES AT BLOOM AND GRABS FOR THE BOOKS.  BLOOM
STILL RETAINS A FIRM HOLD.  THEY STRUGGLE BACK AND FORTH.

                         BLOOM
            I never should have listened to you.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I never should have listened to you.

                         BLOOM
            Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Double.  Double.  Double.

WITH A MIGHTY WRENCH, BIALYSTOCK RIPS THE BOOKS OUT OF
BLOOM'S HANDS.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (clutching the books triumphantly)
            Haaaaa!  Haaaaa!  Haaaaa!

BLOOM FLIPS.  HE ATTACKS BIALYSTOCK LIKE A CRAZY KID,
SCREAMING HYSTERICALLY AND PUNCHING WITH ONE ARM AS HE
PROTECTS HIS FACE WITH THE OTHER.

                         BLOOM
                   (shrieking)
            FAT!  FAT!  FAT!  FAT!  FAT!

BIALYSTOCK GOES CRASHING TO THE FLOOR UNDER THE ONSLAUGHT.
BLOOM DIVES ON TOP OF HIM.  THEY ROLL ON THE FLOOR LOCKED IN
MORTAL COMBAT.  SUDDENLY THREE SHOTS RING OUT IN SUCCESSION.
BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM IMMEDIATELY STOP WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND
TURN TOWARD THE DOOR.

CUT TO LOCK AND HANDLE OF DOOR.  THEY DROP OFF.  A LITTLE
SMOKE RISES FROM THE HOLE.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (off screen, outside door)
            I am betrayed!

                                                           83.


BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM LOOK AT EACH OTHER.

CUT TO THE DOOR.  IT FLIES OPEN.  FRAMED IN THE DOORWAY IS
FRANZ LIEBKIND, SMOKING LUGER IN HAND.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (solemnly)
            You have broken the Siegfried Oath.
            You must die.

HE BLASTS AWAY.  THE WINDOW IS SHATTERED.  PIECES OF WALL GO
WHIZZING THROUGH THE AIR.  BIALYSTOCK DROPS THE LEDGERS AND
HE AND BLOOM DIVE FOR COVER BEHIND THE DESK.

                         LIEBKIND
            This is no good.  I'm not killing
            you.  Don't you understand, you
            have broken the Siegfried Oath.
            You must die.  Vill you cooperate!!!

CUT TO TIGHT TWO SHOT.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM SCRUNCHED
BEHIND DESK.  THEY STARE AT EACH OTHER IN AMAZEMENT.  THERE
IS A TIMOROUS KNOCK AT THE DOOR.

                         BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM
                   (together)
            Come in.  Come in.

ULLA ENTERS.

                         ULLA
            I hear noise.  You call?

SHE LOOKS AROUND.

                         ULLA
            Where are you?

SHE CONTINUES WALKING UNTIL SHE SEES THEM CROUCHED BEHIND
THE DESK.

                         ULLA
            Ahhh.  I see you.  You like
            something?  Coffee?

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM LOOK AT EACH OTHER IN DISBELIEF.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Coffee.  Yes.  That's a good idea.
                   (with great emphasis)
            Why don't you ask the gentleman
            with the gun... The gentleman who
            is shooting at us... and trying to
            kill us... what he will have.

                                                           84.


                         ULLA
                   (to Liebkind)
            You like coffee?

CUT TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.  THEY STARE AT EACH OTHER,
DUMBFOUNDED.

                         LIEBKIND
            Yes, please.  Black.  Two sugars.

ULLA REPEATS TO HERSELF AS SHE STARTS FOR THE DOOR.

                         ULLA
            Three coffees.  Two regular.  One
            black... two sugars.

SHE EXITS AND CLOSES THE DOOR BEHIND HIM.

BIALYSTOCK LOOKS UP TO THE FATES AND MAKES A SMALL SOUND OF
DESPAIR.

                         LIEBKIND
            And now ve must resume hostilities.
            Are you coming out from behind that
            desk or not?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Not.

                         LIEBKIND
            Cowards, miserable cringing cowards.
            Clinging to life like baby
            butterflies.  Vatch, vatch and
            remember.  Franz Liebkind vill show
            you how to die like a man!

HE PLACES THE MUZZLE OF THE GUN AGAINST HIS TEMPLE.  BLOOM
AND BIALYSTOCK PEER OVER THE DESK TO SEE.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (exhalted)
            Soon I vill be vit mine Fuhrer, und
            Goering, und Goebbels, and Himmler.
            I'm coming boys!

HE PULLS THE TRIGGER.  CLICK.  CLICK.  CLICK.  THE GUN IS
JAMMED.  HE THROWS THE GUN DOWN IN DISGUST.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (in utter anguish)
            Boy, vhen things go wrong!

HE FALLS INTO A CHAIR AND SOBS LIKE A CHILD.

                                                           85.


                         LIEBKIND
            I'm a failure.  I'm a failure.  I'm
            a failure.

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM COME OUT FROM BEHIND DESK.  BIALYSTOCK
LOOKS AT HIS WATCH.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Five o'clock.  Killed a whole day
            playing hide-and-seek with a crazy
            Kraut.

BIALYSTOCK PICKS UP LUGER.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (still sobbing)
            I'm not crazy.  I'm inept.

HE CONTINUES TO SOB.  BLOOM WALKS OVER TO THE WEEPING
LIEBKIND AND COMFORTINGLY PATS HIM ON THE SHOULDER.

                         BLOOM
            There, there.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (looking around)
            Vhere?  Vhere?... oh...

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (to Liebkind)
            You crazy lunatic!  What are you
            shooting at us for?  Why don't you
            use this
                   (indicates gun)
            where it will do us some good?  Why
            don't you shoot the actors?
                   (the thought strikes home)
            Liebkind, have I ever steered you
            wrong?

                         LIEBKIND
            Always.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Never mind.  Listen.  Every night
            people are laughing at your beloved
            Fuhrer.  Why?

                         LIEBKIND
            It's that LSD und his verdampter
            babies!...

                                                           86.


                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (handing him the gun
                   and some money)
            Here.  Buy bullets.  Kill.  Kill
            them all!

                         BLOOM
            What???

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (to Bloom)
            Shut up.

                         LIEBKIND
            Yes.  The actors.  I must destroy
            the actors.

LIEBKIND STARTS TO GO.

                         BLOOM
            Stop!  Stop!  This is insanity.

HE LEAPS ACROSS THE ROOM AND WRENCHES THE GUN FROM LIEBKIND'S
HAND.

                         BLOOM
                   (screaming)
            Have you lost your mind?  What are
            you talking about?  Kill the actors.
            You can't kill the actors --
            they're not animals, they're human
            beings!

                         BIALYSTOCK
            They are?  Have you ever eaten with
            one?  Liebkind, go!  Kill!

                         BLOOM
            Liebkind, no!

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (to Bloom)
            What are you doing?  We're trapped.
            It's either the show or us.  There's
            no way out.  What can we do, blow
            up the theatre?

BIALYSTOCK FREEZES AS THE THOUGHT TAKES HOLD.

CUT TO CLOSE-UP OF BLOOM.  HIS EYES NARROW AS HE SERIOUSLY
CONSIDERS THE PROPOSAL.

CUT TO CLOSE-UP LIEBKIND.  HIS FACE A POSTER OF SHINING
APPROVAL.

                                                           87.


CAMERA PULLS BACK.  THE THREE OF THEM SEARCH EACH OTHER'S
FACES EARNESTLY.  THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY IN ACCORD.

FADE OUT:

FADE IN.  DARKENED CELLAR OF THEATRE.  WE SEE THE FAINT GLOW
OF A SHIELDED LAMP AT THE END OF A TUNNEL.  AS THE CAMERA
MOVES THROUGH TUNNEL CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE LIGHT, WE MAKE
OUT THE SHADOWY FORMS OF THREE MEN.

CAMERA DOLLIES IN TO REVEAL BIALYSTOCK, BLOOM AND LIEBKIND.
BLOOM IS HOLDING A MINER'S LAMP.  LIEBKIND IS TRYING BRICK
LOOSE FROM WALL.  BIALYSTOCK IS CONSULTING MAP.  BRICK COMES
LOOSE.  LIEBKIND REMOVES IT.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (the surgeon at work)
            Dynamite.

BLOOM SLAPS A NEATLY TAPED BUNDLE OF DYNAMITE INTO LIEBKIND'S
HAND.  LIEBKIND GENTLY PLACES IT IN OPENING.

                         LIEBKIND
            Fuse cap.

BIALYSTOCK REACHES INTO HIS POCKET AND HANDS HIM A FUSE CAP.
LIEBKIND PUTS CAP IN PLACE.

                         LIEBKIND
            Fuse.

BLOOM REACHES IN POCKET, TAKES OUT SPOOL OF FUSE, HANDS IT
TO LIEBKIND.

                         LIEBKIND
            Thank you.

LIEBKIND TIES FUSE IN PLACE.

                         LIEBKIND
            Gut.  Now for the master connection.

CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM AS THEY MOVE BACK THROUGH THE TUNNEL.
LIEBKIND TRAILS FUSE FROM SPOOL.  THEY FINALLY EMERGE INTO
AN OPEN AREA OF CELLAR DIRECTLY BENEATH THE STAGE.

                         LIEBKIND
            Gut.  Now vhere's the other fuse?

BLOOM RAISES HIS LAMP, REVEALING A SIMILAR TUNNEL ON THE
OTHER SIDE OF THE CELLAR.

                         BLOOM
            There it is.

                                                           88.


CAMERA INSERT: CLOSE-UP SIMILAR FUSE PROTRUDING FROM SECOND
TUNNEL.

BACK TO SCENE.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (to Bloom)
            Pick it up and bring it here, please.

                         BLOOM
            Okay.

HE STARTS TOWARD SECOND TUNNEL.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (anxiously)
            Where are you going vit the light?

                         BLOOM
            I need it.  How'm I gonna find the
            fuse?

                         LIEBKIND
            Oh, ve come vit you.  All for one
            and all in the light.

THE THREE OF THEM GINGERLY TIPTOE OVER TO SECOND TUNNEL
ENTRANCE.  BLOOM PICKS UP THE FUSE.  THEY TIPTOE BACK.
BLOOM HANDS FUSE TO LIEBKIND.

LIEBKIND REACHES INTO HIS KNAPSACK, TAKES OUT LITTLE BLACK
METAL BOX WITH TWO TERMINAL CAPS AT EITHER END AND SETS IT
DOWN ON CELLAR FLOOR.

                         LIEBKIND
            Now ve take the two fuse leads,
            attach them to the terminals of the
            conductor and ve're in business.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (grinning)
            You mean out of business.  Heh, heh.

LIEBKIND BEGINS FIDDLING WITH THE FUSE LEADS AND TERMINALS.

                         BLOOM
            Max, I...

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (irritated.  He has
                   not time for small talk)
            What is it?

                                                           89.


                         BLOOM
            Well, I... Well, it's just that...
            I'm sorry I called you fat, fat, fat.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (smacking Bloom
                   affectionately on the shoulder)
            Ahhhhhh.  Leo, Leo, Leo.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (mumbling to himself)
            Plus to minus.  Negative to positive.
            Male to...

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Come on.  Let's get going.

                         LIEBKIND
            Qviet.  Qviet  This is very
            important.

HE TURNS BACK TO HIS WORK.

                         LIEBKIND
            Vait a minute.  Vait a minute.
            Male to male?  Male to female?
            Female to male?  Female to female?
            Vait a minute.  In people, male to
            female.  But electricity is strange.
            It's male to male.

HE QUICKLY FINISHES THE CONNECTION.

                         LIEBKIND
            Sehr gut.
                   (to Bialystock)
            Slow fuse, please.

BIALYSTOCK REACHES INTO HIS POCKET AND HANDS LIEBKIND A ROLL
OF FUSE.

                         LIEBKIND
            Thank you.

HE BEGINS TYING SLOW FUSE TO CONDUCTOR.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (as he works)
            Now ve take the slow fuse.  Tie one
            end to the master connection and
            the other ve attach to the detonator.

HE FINISHES CONNECTIONS.

                                                           90.


                         LIEBKIND
            Come, ve go to the detonator.

THEY BEGIN TO MOVE BACK AS LIEBKIND SLOWLY SPOOLS OUT FUSE.
THEY START UP THE STAIRS.

                         LIEBKIND
            Vait a minute.  Are you sure this
            is slow fuse?  It feels like qvick
            fuse.
                   (to Bloom)
            Shine your light on it.

BLOOM SHINES LIGHT ON FUSE.

                         LIEBKIND
            I don't know.  I don't know.  The
            markings are so similar.  Qvick
            fuse or slow fuse?

LIEBKIND TAKES A WOODEN MATCH OUT OF HIS POCKET.

                         LIEBKIND
            I must find out.  It is critical.

HE STRIKES THE MATCH AND LIGHTS THE FUSE.  WHOOSH!  IT
IGNITES.  THE SPARKS RUSH TOWARD THE MASTER CONNECTION.
LIEBKIND CHARGES DOWN THE STAIRS AND CHASES AFTER THE QUICK
BURNING FUSE FOR ALL HE'S WORTH.  HE CATCHES UP WITH IT JUST
BEFORE IT REACHES THE MASTER CONNECTION AND QUICKLY STAMPS
IT OUT.

                         LIEBKIND
            Let's face it.  That was dumb.

HE TROTS BACK.

                         LIEBKIND
            Boys, vhere is you?

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM COME CRAWLING OUT FROM BEHIND STAIRS.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (seeing them)
            Dot vas the qvick one.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            We assumed that.

LIEBKIND REACHES INTO HIS POCKET AND SHOWS THEM A ROLL OF
FUSE.

                                                           91.


                         LIEBKIND
            Here.  You see.  This is the slow
            fuse.  It is much wider.  It has
            more resistance, more density.
            Therefore, it burns slower.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            You mean you had the slow fuse in
            your pocket all the time and you
            forgot to put it on?

                         LIEBKIND
            Yes.  Amazing isn't it?

BIALYSTOCK RAISES HIS CANE AND SMASHES LIEBKIND ON THE
HELMET.  BONNNG.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            You stupid kraut!

                         LIEBKIND
            Vhy do you always call me kraut?
            Kraut is cabbage!  Do ve call you
            hot dogs?  Ve call you Yanks not
            franks!

                         BIALYSTOCK
            All right.  Finish the job.  Let's
            get outta here.

CUT TO SIDE DOOR OF THEATRE.  THE DOOR OPENS SLOWLY.
BIALYSTOCK, BLOOM AND LIEBKIND TIPTOE OUT.  BLOOM SETS
DETONATOR DOWN.

                         LIEBKIND
            Und now for the final connection.

HE WRAPS THE FUSE LEAD AROUND THE METAL CONTACT POLE AND
RAISES THE PLUNGER.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Wait.  I'll check to see if the
            coast is clear.

HE RUNS TO THE END OF THE ALLEY.  LOOKS BOTH WAYS AND RUNS
BACK.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            The coast is clear!

                         LIEBKIND
            Good.  Get down.

                                                           92.


BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM CROUCH DOWN AND HOLD THEIR EARDRUMS.
LIEBKIND GRABS THE HANDLE OF THE DETONATOR.  HIS EYES
SUDDENLY GLISTEN WITH TEARS.

                         LIEBKIND
            Goodbye, my foolish fancy.  Goodbye,
            my misbegotten child.  Goodbye, my
            tortured testament of twisted truths.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Do it!  Do it!

LIEBKIND TENSES HIMSELF FOR THE PLUNGE.  HE STARTS AND STOPS.

                         LIEBKIND
            I can't.  I can't do it.  It's a
            demon.  It's a gargoyle, it's a
            monster... but it's still my child.

HE SOBS INCONSOLABLY.  BIALYSTOCK ROUGHLY PUSHES HIM ASIDE
AND GRABS THE HANDLE OF THE DETONATOR AND PLUNGES IT DOWN.
HE HURLS HIMSELF TO THE GROUND AND COVERS HIS HEAD IN
ANTICIPATION OF THE EXPLOSION.  NOTHING HAPPENS.  AFTER A
WHILE THEY ALL RAISE THEIR HEADS CURIOUSLY.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (quizzically)
            Nothing.

LIEBKIND GOES TO PLUNGER, RAISES HANDLE AND EXAMINES
DETONATOR.

                         LIEBKIND
            Here is gut... of course, of course.
            In electricity, it's always male to
            female.  But with people, it's not
            always so.  Come ve must go back.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Do you need us?

                         LIEBKIND
            Of course I need you.  It's dark in
            there.

                         BLOOM
            Okay, okay.  Let's not waste time.

THEY OPEN THE SIDE DOOR AND DISAPPEAR INTO THE THEATRE.

                         DRUNK
                   (off camera, singing)
            "Honeymoon, keep a shinin' in June,"

                                                           93.


CUT TO ENTRANCE OF ALLEY.  DRUNK COMES STAGGERING INTO VIEW.
HE SPOTS DETONATOR.

                         DRUNK
            "your silvery beams,
            Will light love's dreams,"  What
            the heck is that?  A bicycle pump?
            Naaah.  Lemme see.  Could it be?
            Good grief, it's Eli Whitney's
            cotton gin... Naaah.  Aahh, I know
            what it is.

HE WALKS OVER TO DETONATOR AND SITS ON FIRE STANCHION JUST
BEHIND IT.  HE RAISES HIS FOOT AND STARTS IT DOWN TOWARD THE
PLUNGER.

                         DRUNK
            Shine 'em up!

HE PUSHES PLUNGER DOWN WITH HIS FOOT.

CUT TO LONG SHOT OF THEATRE.  (MOCK UP) THERE IS A TERRIFIC
EXPLOSION.  PIECES OF THE THEATRE GO FLYING THROUGH THE AIR.

CUT TO TIGHT SHOT OF DRUNK.  HE IS ON HIS KNEES.  DEBRIS
CRASHES ALL AROUND HIM.  SMOKE AND NOISE FILL THE AIR.  HE
STAGGERS TO HIS FEET.  HE ROCKS BACK AND FORTH AS THOUGH HE
WERE IN AN EARTHQUAKE.

                         DRUNK
                   (bravely singing)
            "Sa-an Fra-ancisco, open your
            golden gates,
            Don't let a stranger wait...

DISSOLVE TO TIGHT SHOT OF JUDGE'S GAVEL SOLEMNLY RAPPING FOR
ORDER.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL CROWDED COURTROOM.

CAMERA MOVES IN TO FOREGROUND OF COURT.  THERE, SEATED AT
THE DEFENDANT'S TABLE ARE, IN ORDER, BLOOM WITH HIS ARM IN A
SLING, BIALYSTOCK WITH HIS LEG IN A CAST, AND A MUMMY
SWATHED IN BANDAGES.  WE KNOW THE MUMMY IS LIEBKIND BECAUSE
IT IS WEARING A GERMAN HELMET.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (mumbling through his bandages)
            Male to male?  Male to female?

CUT TO TIGHT SHOT OF JUDGE.

                         JUDGE
            Has the jury reached a verdict?

                                                           94.


CUT TO JURY.  THEIR EXPRESSIONS INDICATE THAT THEY ARE NOT
AT ALL WELL-DISPOSED TOWARD THE DEFENDANTS.

CAMERA CLOSES IN ON FOREMAN.  HE RISES.

                         FOREMAN
            We have, your honor.

                         JUDGE
                   (off camera)
            How does the jury find?

                         FOREMAN
            We find the defendants incredibly
            guilty.

CUT TO JUDGE.

                         JUDGE
            Will the defendants please rise and
            approach the bench.

CUT TO BIALYSTOCK, BLOOM AND LIEBKIND.  THEY STRUGGLE TO
THEIR FEET AND HOBBLE TO THE JUDGE'S BENCH.

                         JUDGE
            Do the defendants have anything to
            say in their behalf before the
            court pronounces sentence?

                         BLOOM
            I would like to say a word, sir,
            not on my behalf, but in behalf of
            my partner, Max Bialystock.

                         JUDGE
            Proceed.

                         BLOOM
            Thank you, your honor.  Max
            Bialystock is a very selfish man.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (whispers to Bloom)
            Don't help me.

                         BLOOM
            He's a liar and a cheat and a
            scoundrel.  He's taken money from
            little old ladies.  He's talked
            people into doing things they never
            would have dreamed of.  Especially
            me.  But who has he really hurt?
                         (MORE)

                                                           95.


                         BLOOM (CONT'D)
            Who are the victims?  Not me, I had
            the most exciting adventure of my
            life.  And what about the little
            old ladies?  What would their lives
            have been without Max Bialystock?
            He made them feel wanted and young
            and attractive again.

                         LITTLE OLD LADIES
                   (off camera, ad-lib)
            "Oh, Max, Max, I love you Max."
            "Let him go, let him go."
            "Don't take my Bialy."

                         JUDGE
                   (rapping gavel)
            Order.  Order.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            And may I humbly add, your honor,
            that we have learned our lesson and
            we'll never do it again.

                         JUDGE
            I will take that into consideration.
            The defendants shall serve not more
            than five and not less than two
            years in the State Penitentiary.
                   (he pounds gavel)

                         BIALYSTOCK

                   shouting at the top
                   of his lungs)
