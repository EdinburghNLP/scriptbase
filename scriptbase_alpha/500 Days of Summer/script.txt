          EXT. PARK - DAY
          
          For a few seconds we watch A MAN (20s) and a WOMAN (20s) on a
          park bench. Their names are TOM and SUMMER. Neither one says
          a word.
          
          
          CLOSE ON her HAND, covering his. Notice the wedding ring. No
          words are spoken. Tom looks at her the way every woman wants
          to be looked at.
          
          A DISTINGUISHED VOICE begins to speak to us.

          The boy is TOM HANSEN. He sits at a very long rectangular
          conference table. The walls are lined with framed blow-up
          sized greeting cards. Tom, dark hair and blue eyes, wears a t-
          shirt under his sports coat and Adidas tennis shoes to
          balance out the corporate dress code. He looks pretty bored.

                    The boy, Tom Hansen of Margate, New
                    Jersey, grew up believing that he'd
                    never truly be happy until the day
                    he met his... "soulmate."

          PRE-TEEN TOM sits alone on his bed engrossed in a movie. His
          walls are covered in posters of obscure bands. From the TV,
          we hear: "Elaine! Elaine!"

                              NARRATOR
                    This belief stemmed from early
                    exposure to sad British pop music
                    and a total misreading of the
                    movie, "The Graduate."

          The girl is SUMMER FINN. She files folders and answers phones
          in a plain white office. She has cropped blonde hair almost
          like a boy's but her face is feminine and pretty enough to
          get away with it.

                    Since the disintegration of her
                    parents' marriage, she'd only loved
                    two things. The first was her long
                    blonde hair.
          
          She picks up scissors from the counter and begins to slice.

                              SUMMER
                    This can't be a total surprise. I
                    mean, we've been like Sid and Nancy
                    for months.
          
                              TOM
                    Summer, Sid stabbed Nancy seven
                    times with a kitchen knife. We've
                    had some disagreements but I hardly
                    think I'm Sid Vicious.
          
                              SUMMER
                    No... I'm Sid.
          
                                                                    10.

                    So I'm Nancy?!
          
          The Waitress comes out with the food. Tom and Summer stop
          their discussion until the meal is served and the Waitress
          leaves. Summer starts to eat.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Let's just eat and we'll talk about
                    it after. I'm starving.
          
          Without another word she goes back to her pancakes. Tom
          watches her eat like this is the worst travesty in the
          history of mankind.
          
                              SUMMER
                        (mouth full)
                    Mmm, you're so right. These are
                    great!
          
          Tom looks at his food in disgust. He may never eat again.

                              TOM
                    Well they're wrong. It's not true.
                    I've fished in that sea. I've
                    jumped in and swam in that sea! I'm

                        (to Rachel)
                    Sorry. What I mean is... there are
                    no other fish. This was my fish.

                    Now I know this may be a little
                    risque...but if New Hampshire

                    conservative, right-wing neo-Nazis
                    at Hallmark, maybe playing it safe
                    is the wrong approach. The nuclear
                    family is dead and we need a new
                    holiday to recognize that.

                    Hmmm. That's an intriguing idea
                    McKenzie. Along with Grossman's
                    "Magellan Day" I'd say we've got
                    some potential here. What do you
                    think Hansen? Could you write up
                    some prototypes for these?

          Tom is listening to headphones. Summer enters the elevator
          and Tom actively puts on a show to ignore her. Summer hears
          the music.
          
                              SUMMER
                    The Smiths.
          
          Tom, pretending not to hear or care, gives her an
          unenthusiastic wave.
          
                              SUMMER
                    I love The Smiths.
          
          Tom, still pretending, takes off his headphones.
          
                              TOM
                    Sorry?

                    good taste in music.
          
          A beat as Tom processes this information.

          Really? Jesus. Did you always want
          to write greeting cards?
          
                     TOM
          Are you nuts? I don't even want to
          do it now.
          
                    SUMMER
          What is it you want to do?
          
                    TOM
          I studied to be an architect
          actually.
          
                    SUMMER
          That's so cool! What happened?
          
                    TOM
          Eh, you know. Same old story. Moved
          to the city to work for a company.
          Company went under. Needed a job.
          My friend worked here. Got me this.
          
                    SUMMER
          And are you any good?

          It's a big seller.

          I meant, are you any good as an
          architect?
          
                    TOM
          Oh... No. I doubt it.
          
                    SUMMER
          Well, I'd say you're a perfectly
          ...adequate... greeting card
          writer.
          
                                                                  19.

                    Why thank you. That's what they
                    called me in college. "Perfectly
                    adequate" Hansen.

                    I was very neat and organized.
          
          There's an awkward silence.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Anyway, I should get back.
          
                              TOM
                    Ok, well, I'll see you around.
          
          She walks back to her cubicle at the other end of the hall.
          Tom watches her walk away, completely enamored.
          
          He sits down at his desk and sets out to work. But before he
          does, his eyes fall on a sketch he drew of a house. It's
          dated 2001 and it's the only architecture sketch on his wall.

                              TOM
                    What's complicated? Last week you
                    said you loved me!
          
                              AMANDA
                    I know it's sudden but...
          
                              TOM
                    No, this can't be. Everything was
                    going so great. I don't understand.
          
                                 AMANDA
                        (BEAT)
                    Here.
          
                              TOM
                    What's this?
          
          She puts a disc into the cd player.
          
                              AMANDA
                    Because you're, like, the biggest
                    music nerd I've ever met, I think
                    this should really help explain
                    where I'm coming from.
          
          A pop song begins to play on the stereo. They listen for a
          few beats. Tom is confused.
          
                              AMANDA
                    You remember how much I loved this
                    song when you first played it for
                    me?
          
                              TOM
                    Sure. It's all you wanted to listen
                    to for weeks.
          
                                                                  24.
          
          
          
                              AMANDA
                    Right. And I still like it, don't
                    get me wrong. It's just... When I
                    hear it now, I don't feel the
                    same...rush.
          
                              TOM
                        (still confused)
                    Ok...
          
                              AMANDA
                    I press the skip button.
          
          Still Tom doesn't understand.
          
                              TOM
                    What does this have to do with--?
          
                              AMANDA
                    I'd rather listen to something
                    else.
          
          And with that, it slowly sinks in for him.
          
                              TOM
                    But Amanda... this is a great
                    fucking song!

                    No. But it could have been. In a
                    world where good things happen to
                    me.

                    Yeah well, that's not really where
                    we live.

                    So there we are. All alone. Nine
                    more floors to ride. Plenty of
                    time. I figure...this is my chance.
                    If not now when, right?

                    I think I missed something.
          
                               TOM
                    "It was good." She didn't say "It
                    was good." She said "It was good."
                    Emphasis on the good. She basically
                    said "I spent the weekend having
                    sex with this guy I met at the
                    gym." Fucking whore. Screw her.

                    She's not interested in me. There's
                    nothing I can do.
          
                              MCKENZIE

                    And some other things.
          
                              PAUL
                    Like what, she said "hey" instead
                    of "hi" cause that totally means
                    she's a lesbian.
          
                              TOM

          and Summer are two of them. Tom takes this opportunity to put
          a CD in his computer and play the song really loud. It's "I
          Want to Know What Love Is" by Foreigner. No reaction from
          Summer. Tom turns it up. Still nothing. Tom turns it down,
          defeated.

                    Do you want to go out with me?
          
          A beat. Summer says nothing.
          
                              TOM
                    And the Priest says, "But we're
                    already out!"
          
          They both laugh.

                    That is hilarious!

                    I mean...my plans got cancelled...
          
          Tom is at a loss. There's yet another awkward silent beat
          between them. Thankfully, it's interrupted by...
          
                              MCKENZIE
                        (already drunk)
                    Goddamn that song is brilliant!
                    What's up Hansen?
          
          Summer sees the next song come up on the screen.
          
                                                                  30.
          
          
          
                              SUMMER
                    Ooh that's me.
          
          She downs a shot and jumps up on stage.
          
                               SUMMER
                        (into mic)
                    Ok. I'm the new girl so no making
                    fun of me.
          
          Her co-workers whistle and cheer her on. She takes a deep
          breath as the opening bars of "Born to Run" begin to play and
          Summer starts to sing. Tom sees Summer as the actress in
          whatever nonsensical karaoke video accompanies the song (it's
          something to do with an old convertible, the sunset, and a
          midget in a tuxedo.)
          
          LATER. Tom sits in the booth with McKenzie (doing a shot) as
          Summer chats with co-workers at another table. Tom can't help
          but stare at Summer. She notices and waves. He smiles,
          hopeful that she'll come over. She doesn't. He hides his
          disappointment.
          
          LATER. Tom walks back to his table with drinks. Summer is
          there in mid-conversation with McKenzie.
          
                              TOM
                    You were great up there, by the
                    way.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Well you can't go wrong with The
                    Boss.
          
                              TOM
                        (sitting down)
                    I hear that.
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    Hey, did you know Tom here's from
                    Jersey?
          
                              SUMMER
                    Yeah?
          
                              TOM
                    Lived there til I was 12.
          
                              SUMMER
                    I named my cat after Springsteen.
          
                              TOM
                    No kidding? What's his name?
          
                                                                  31.
          
          
          
                               SUMMER
                    Bruce.
          
                               TOM
                        (BEAT)
                    That makes sense.
          
          She laughs. She's really cute when she laughs.
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    So you got a boyfriend?
          
                               SUMMER
                    Me? No.
          
          Tom shoots daggers at McKenzie for that comment. McKenzie
          mouths "what?" Summer sees nothing.
          
                               MCKENZIE
                    Why not?
          
                              SUMMER
                    Don't really want one.
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    Come on. I don't believe that.
          
                              SUMMER
                    You don't believe a woman could
                    enjoy being free and independent?
          
                               MCKENZIE
                        (BEAT)
                    Are you a lesbian?
          
                              SUMMER
                    No, I'm not a lesbian. I'm just not
                    comfortable being somebody's
                    "girlfriend." I don't want to be
                    anybody's anything, you know?
                              MCKENZIE
                    I have no idea what you're talking
                    about.
          
                              SUMMER
                    It sounds selfish, I know, but... I
                    just like being on my own.
                    Relationships are messy and
                    feelings are always getting hurt.
                    Who needs all that? We're young.
                    We're in one of the most beautiful
                    cities in the world.

                              SUMMER (cont'd)
                    I say, let's have as much fun as we
                    can afford and leave the serious
                    shit for later.
          
                              TOM
                    But...what if you meet someone and
                    fall in love?
          
                              SUMMER
                        (LAUGHS)
                    Love? You seriously believe in that
                    stuff?
          
                              TOM
                    Of course I do.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Interesting. A real romantic.
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    Oh you have no idea. This one...
                    embarrassing. There was this one
                    girl,
                        (to Tom)
                    I gotta tell this story --
          
          Tom elbows McKenzie hard in the ribs to shut him up.
          
                              TOM
                    Summer, hold on... you don't
                    believe in love?
          
                              SUMMER
                    I don't even know what that word
                    means. I know I've never felt it,
                    whatever it is in all those songs.
                    And I know that today most
                    marriages end in divorce. Like my
                    parents.
          
                              TOM
                    Well mine too but --
          
                              SUMMER
                    Oh yeah, And I read in Newsweek,
                    there were these scientists who
                    found that by stimulating a part of
                    the brain with electrodes you can
                    make a person fall in "love" with a
                    rock. Is that the love you're
                    talking about?
          
                              TOM
                    Well...
          
                                                                  33.
          
          
          
                              SUMMER
                    Why, what's your take on it?
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          AN ANIMATION SEQUENCE, real quick. AN EXPLOSION OF MANY
          DIFFERENT COLORS, COMPLETE WITH A CHOIR AND A CHURCH ORGAN
          ALL BUILDING TO A HUGE CRESCENDO.
          
                                                           BACK TO:
          
          
          INT BAR
          
          On Tom:
          
                              TOM
                    I think it's...kind of a huge
                    thing.
          
                               SUMMER
                        (BEAT)
                    Ok. Looks like we're gonna have to
                    agree to disagree on that one.
          
          McKenzie senses some discontent.
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    So, uh, who's singing next?
          
                              SUMMER
                        (re: singing)
                    I'd say it's your turn loverboy.
          
                              TOM
                    Nooo. I don't sing in public.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Sure you do. I see you lip-synching
                    to your headphones every morning on
                    your way in.
          
                                 TOM
                    I don't...
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    You really do.
          
                              SUMMER
                    It's ok. I like it. Takes a lot of
                    self-confidence to look ridiculous.
          
                                                                  34.
          
          
          
                              MCKENZIE
                        (can't help himself)
                    Self-confidence! Ha!
          
          Tom elbows him in the ribs again.
          
                              TOM
                    Anyway, I'm not near drunk enough
                    to sing in front of all these
                    people.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Ok then. Let's drink.
          
                              TOM
                    It would take at least ten shots to
                    get me to sing.
          
                                 SUMMER
                    Bartender!
          
          TEN MINUTES LATER. Tom is up there singing The Clash's
          "Magnificent Seven." You wouldn't think so but Tom is a ROCK
          STAR up there! He's dancing like Jagger, he's got everyone in
          the bar singing along to the audience-participation parts.
          It's a sight to behold. Summer is all smiles watching.
          
          LATER. Tom and Summer back at the table. Summer is humming
          something.
          
                              TOM
                    That's not it.
          
                              SUMMER
                    What is that then?
          
                              TOM
                    I have no idea.
          
          They're both having a good time.
          
                              SUMMER
                    I used to watch it every week.
          
                              TOM
                    Me too. Why can't we think of the
                    stupid A-Team theme song.
          
                                 SUMMER
                    Pathetic.
          
                              TOM
                    This is gonna bother me for weeks.
          
                                                                  35.
          
          
          
                                 SUMMER
                    Totally.
          
          They share another laugh and then it gets quiet. In that good
          way.
          
          ANGLE ON McKenzie, wasted, singing the shit out of "Proud to
          Be an American." He really means it. At any minute he might
          start to cry.
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    "And I'd proudly stand UP!"
                        (aggressive drunk)
                    I said stand!
          
          BACK ON TOM and SUMMER.
          
                              TOM
                    Oh here we go.
          
          
          EXT KARAOKE BAR - LATER
          
          Tom helps a nearly comatose McKenzie exit the place. Summer
          is with them.
          
                              MCKENZIE
                        (to Summer)
                    This guy.
                        (DRAMATICALLY)
                    He's the best.
          
                              TOM
                    Ok, let's get you in a cab.
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    No. I'm gonna walk. I live right
                    down that street. Or that one.
          
                              SUMMER
                        (LAUGHING)
                    Is he gonna be ok?
          
                              TOM
                    He'll be fine.
          
          A cab arrives. Tom and Summer help McKenzie inside.
          
                                 MCKENZIE
                    Hey.
          
                                 TOM
                    What's up?
          
                                                                    36.
          
          
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    Not you. You.
                        (beat, to Summer)
                    He likes you.
          
                              TOM
                        (QUICKLY)
                    Ok, goodnight McKenzie!
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    I mean... likes you, likes you. For
                    real. Tell her Tom.
          
          Tom shuts the door on McKenzie as fast as he can. Now it's
          just Tom and Summer. Tom talks a mile a minute to try and
          erase McKenzie's last exchange from her mind.
          
                              TOM
                    Sorry you had to see that. Happens
                    every time we come here. It's
                    unbelievable. Something about that
                    guy and singing for people. I don't
                    know. But at least he didn't --
          
                              SUMMER
                    Is that true?
          
                              TOM
                    What?
          
                              SUMMER
                    You know what. Do you...like me?
          
                              TOM
                    Yeah. I like you. Of course I do.
          
                              SUMMER
                    As a friend.
          
                              TOM
                    Right. As a friend.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Just as a friend?
          
          The wheels are spinning in Tom's head. What's the right
          answer here?
          
                              TOM
                    Yes. I mean... I haven't really
                    thought about... Yes. Why?
          
                                                                     37.
          
          
          
                               SUMMER
                     Nothing. I just... You're
                     interesting. I'd like us to be
                     friends. Is that ok?
          
          Tom was clearly hoping for her to say something else. He
          hides his disappointment the best he can.
          
                               TOM
                     Oh yeah totally. Friends. You and
                     me. That's... perfect.
          
                               SUMMER
                     Cool.
          
                               TOM
                     Cool.
          
          Silence.
          
                               SUMMER
                     Well, I'm that way. Good night Tom.
          
                               TOM
                     G'night Summer.
          
          Tom watches her walk away for a beat before he turns to go
          the other way.
          
                               TOM
                         (under his breath)
                     Friends. Awesome. That's just
                     great. Well done Hansen, you idiot.
          
          Tom walks a few more steps.
          
          And then, seemingly out of nowhere, without his even
          noticing, SUMMER HAS WRAPPED HER ARMS AROUND HIM AND PULLED
          HIM INTO A KISS!
          
          It's unbelievable. There's a few seconds where Tom isn't sure
          if he's dreaming or not. But then he realizes, suddenly, out
          of the blue, his best case scenario really is actually
          happening.

          FADE UP: "YOU MAKE MY DREAMS COME TRUE" by Hall and Oates.
          
                                                                  38.
          
          
          
          
          EXT STREET - MORNING
          
          It's the greatest morning of all time!
          
          Tom walks down the street. Or, more accurately, Tom struts
          down the street. He's pointing at people as he passes,
          winking, doing a little shuffle. He is the man. He checks out
          his reflection in a window. A YOUNG PAUL NEWMAN stares back.
          
          People wave as he passes, they clap, they give him thumbs up.
          A parade forms behind him. The POSTMAN, a POLICE OFFICER, the
          HOT DOG VENDOR, RONALD MCDONALD and MAYOR MCCHEESE, everybody
          loves Tom today. HALL and OATES themselves walk with Tom
          singing the song.
          
          Cars stop at crosswalks to let Tom go by. The DRIVERS also
          pump their fists in celebration of Tom's achievement last
          night. He walks on, the man. We notice the sidewalk lights up
          every time he touches the pavement like in "Billie Jean".
          
          CARTOON BIRDS fly onto Tom's shoulder. He smiles and winks at
          them.
          
          
          INT OFFICE - SAME
          
          Tom passes Summer's office whistling Hall and Oates. She sees
          him and immediately lights up.
          
                                 SUMMER
                    Hey!
          
                                 TOM
                    Hey!
          
          Vance pokes out of his corner office.
          
                              VANCE.
                    Summer, I need -- Oh hello Hansen.
          
                              TOM
                    Hey Mr. Vance.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Yes, Mr. Vance?
          
          And they're all business. As Tom turns to go, however, Summer
          gives him a little coy smile that would be enough to make
          anyone's day complete. Tom gives her the international signal
          for `I'll call you later' in return. Vance sees none of it.
          Tom walks to his cubicle, still on top of the world.
          
                                                                  39.
          
          
          
          
          INT TOM'S PLACE - THAT NIGHT
          
          Tom answers the door. It's Paul (in hospital scrubs).
          
                              PAUL
                    You son of a bitch.
          
          He walks inside without waiting for an invite.
          
                              PAUL
                    Last night, karaoke night?
          
                              TOM
                        (ANXIOUS)
                    Shhh.
          
                               PAUL
                    The same girl you'd been whining
                    and crying and bitching about for
                    weeks now?
          
                              TOM
                    I have not been...
          
                              PAUL
                    The same girl you said was way out
                    of your league and you'd have no
                    chance with no matter what. That
                    girl?
          
                              TOM
                    Paul, seriously...
          
                              PAUL
                    Did you bang her?
          
                                TOM
                    No!
          
                                PAUL
                    Blow job?
          
                                TOM
                    No!
          
                                PAUL
                    Hand job?
          
                              TOM
                    No, Paul, no jobs. I'm still
                    unemployed. We just kissed.
          
                                                                  40.
          
          
          
                              PAUL
                    Come on, level with me. As your
                    best friend, who tolerated a whole
                    month of talk talk talk about this
                    girl, nothing but Summer this,
                    Summer that, Summer Summer Summer,
                    I mean you were practically
                    stalking her...
          
                               TOM
                    Shhh!
          
          Suddenly, the sound of a toilet flushing is heard. From the
          bathroom emerges Summer, dressed to go out.
          
                               PAUL
                    Oh crap.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Hi, I'm Summer..
          
                              PAUL
                    Summer, wow what an unusual name.
                    I'm sure I'd remember that if I had
                    heard it before. Tom, how come
                    you've never mentioned you knew
                    such a lovely little lady?
                        (off Tom's nasty look)
                    Or perhaps you have and I've just
                    forgot.
                        (to Summer)
                    I mean, with all the women in Tom's
                    life it's hard to keep track...
                        (not helping)
                    Ok, well, I was just... I'm Paul.
          
                               SUMMER
                    Hi Paul.
          
                              PAUL
                        (not sure what else to
                         SAY)
                    I'm a doctor.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Nice to meet you.
          
                              PAUL
                    Anyway, I'm leaving now. Pretend I
                    was never here. Tom, talk to you
                    later?... Hey, If any jobs open
                    up...
          
                                                                  41.
          
          
          
          Tom quickly shuts the door on Paul.
          
                              TOM
                    If you heard...
          
                              SUMMER
                    Heard what?
          
                              TOM
                    Excellent. You ready to go.
          
                              SUMMER
                    I'm stalking, STARVING!
          
          Tom realizes she's heard it all.
          
                              TOM
                        (PLAYFULLY)
                    He exaggerates!
          
          
          (198)
          INT CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
          
          Tom and Summer eating, not really talking much. At another
          table, Tom sees a VERY UNATTRACTIVE COUPLE feeding each other
          food.
          
                              TOM
                    Check them out.
          
          Summer sees. She has no reaction.
          
                              TOM
                        (SARCASTIC)
                    That is hot.
          
          Summer keeps eating.
          
                              TOM
                    I am very turned on right now.

                    Sometimes you can be so judgmental.
          
                                 TOM
                    Huh?
          
                                                                  42.

                    Just mind your own business.

          An equally UNATTRACTIVE COUPLE go at it in a booth. PAN
          ACROSS to find Tom and Summer early in their relationship, in
          a booth across the room, watching in hysterics.

                    Too soon to say. It's all in the
                    dismount.
          
                              TOM
                    If we're lucky, there won't be a
                    dismount.
          
          Summer, her cheeks flushed already from laughing, loses it
          again. They are having a great night.

                    I hear ya. If I want to watch
                    people make out, I have big windows
                    and binoculars at home.

          Summer and Tom come bounding in, lip-locked and all over each
          other. They fall on his bed and begin undressing each other.
          Suddenly, Tom stops.
          
                                                                    44.

          He walks into the hallway, out of her sight. He looks into
          the hallway mirror.
          
                              TOM
                    Settle. Don't get too excited.
                    She's just a girl. There's lots of
                    them. Who look like that. And like
                    what you like. They're everywhere.
                    Calm yourself.
          
          He takes a few deep breaths.
          
                               TOM

                    Ok. Then it's time to go back in.
          
          We watch from behind as he re-enters his bedroom. Where
          Summer waits. Under the covers. Naked.

          the bin like it's some family heirloom. He gives the

                    church. The beauty of St. Patrick's
                    is its humility. With this giant
                    mirror thing deflecting all the
                    attention away, it's too humble. No

          Summer gives him a pen from her purse and the underside of
          her arm. Tom thinks about this. Then he starts to draw a
          sketch on her skin. We catch her watching his face as he
          draws. She's attracted to his enthusiasm.

          Tom and Summer, who have ridden together to work, stand
          outside the building.
          
                                                                     49.
          
          
          
                              SUMMER
                    You wanna --
          
                              TOM
                    No you go first.
          
                              SUMMER
                    It doesn't matter to me.
          
                              TOM
                    Whatever you want.
          
          A CO-WORKER passes.
          
                              CO-WORKER
                    Hey Summer. Tom.
          
                              BOTH
                        (like nothing's up)
                    Hey./ Hi.
          
          Summer joins the co-worker and walks in.
          
                              SUMMER
                        (to Co-Worker)
                    So how's it going?
          
          She turns back to look at Tom on the way. She sticks out her
          tongue to be cute. Co-Worker doesn't see. Tom is crazy about
          her.
          
          
          INT OFFICE - LATER
          
          Tom at his cubicle with the one architecture sketch. The
          phone rings and he picks it up.
          
                                 TOM
                    Hello?
          
                              SUMMER (V.O.)
                    I remember!
          
          
          INT COPY ROOM - DAY
          
          Summer is on her cell phone in the office copy room. She
          begins to sing the theme song to "The A-Team."
          
                                 TOM (V.O.)
                    That's it!
          
                                                                  50.
          
          
          
          McKenzie enters and sees her singing into the phone. Turns
          without a word and leaves.
          
          
          INT TOM'S CUBICLE - SAME
          
          Tom listening to her sing. McKenzie comes over.
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    Your girl is losing it.
          
          Tom is too wrapped up in the phone call to acknowledge him.
          The smile on his face is the biggest we've seen yet.

          INT. SHOWER - LATER
          
          We just see the curtain, but we can see their silhouettes
          behind it. Summer and Tom are trying to have sex in the
          shower. They're trying to stable themselves, grip something
          so as not to fall, elbows are flying, it's a mess.
          
                              SUMMER
                    This is not at all as easy as it
                    looks.
          
                                TOM
                    Ow!
          
          The curtain rips and the bar comes crashing down. They fall
          on top of each other laughing.

          Tom and Summer wander through the aisles.
          
                              TOM
                    There's no way.
          
                                SUMMER
                    Why not?
          
                                                                  51.
          
          
          
                              TOM
                    "Octopus's Garden?" You may as well
                    just say "Piggies?"
          
                              SUMMER
                    I told you. I love Ringo.
          
                              TOM
                    You're insane.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Why?
          
                              TOM
                    Cause nobody loves Ringo.
          
                                SUMMER
                    That's what I love about him.
                         (BEAT)
                    Ooh.
          
          Summer drags Tom into the curtained-off "Porn" section. She
          picks up a box.
          
                              SUMMER

                    This got great reviews.
          
          
          INT. SUMMER'S APARTMENT - LATER
          
          Tom and Summer get comfortable. Both are excited and looking
          forward to this. The movie starts, the credits roll. Tom and
          Summer start to make out a bit, both keeping an eye on the
          TV.

          got popcorn.

                              PAUL
                    So what's going on with you and
                    Summer?
          
                              TOM
                    I don't know.
          
                              PAUL
                    Is she your girlfriend?
          
                              TOM
                    I wouldn't say that.
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    What would you say?
          
                              TOM
                    Like, are we "going steady?" Come
                    on, guys. We're adults.
          
                              PAUL
                    It's not an unreasonable question.
                    Watch. McKenzie, do you have a
                    girlfriend?
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    No I do not. In fact girls are
                    repulsed by me. Paul, how about
                    you?
          
                              PAUL
                    Why yes, in fact I do. Her name is
                    Robyn. See Tom, it's easy.
          
                              TOM
                    It is when you've been with the
                    same girl since high school.
          
                              PAUL
                    You've been "seeing" this girl,
                    what, two months now?
          
                              TOM
                    Something like that.
          
                              PAUL
                    And you haven't discussed it?
          
                                                          53.

                    No! She's not... We're not like
                    that.
          
                                 PAUL
                    Like what?
          
                                 MCKENZIE
                    Normal.
          
                              TOM
                    We've just been... hanging out.
          
                              PAUL
                    Hanging out?!
          
                              TOM
                    Yeah. Guys, look, Summer and I...we
                    know how we feel. We don't need to
                    label it. "Boyfriend, girlfriend."
                    That stuff is very... juvenile.
          
          Beat.

                              PAUL
                    Well let me ask you this then. Do
                    you want her to be your girlfriend?
          
          Tom takes a second to think about this.
          
                              TOM
                    I don't know... Maybe.
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    I heard her Hansen. She's not the
                    girlfriend type. You're gonna need
                    to discuss it.
          
                              TOM
                    No. We're adults. It'll be fine.
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    Have you made her a CD yet?

                    Oh dude.

                    You really need to have that talk.

          Rachel is playing field hockey on the 7th grade team. Tom is
          watching from behind the players' bench. A whistle blows and
          Rachel comes back and sits down.
          
                              RACHEL
                    You were saying?
          
                              TOM
                    My thinking is... why rock the
                    boat? Things are going well. If we
                    start putting labels on it, that's
                    like the kiss of death. Like saying
                    to a girl "I love you."
          
                              RACHEL
                    I know what you mean. That's what
                    happened with me and Sean.
          
                              TOM
                    Who the hell's Sean?
          
                              RACHEL
                    My boyfriend before Mark.
          
                              TOM
                    Who the f--! Never mind. Help me. I
                    need solid female advice.
          
                              RACHEL
                    I'm 12.
          
                              TOM
                    Yeah but, you know me. This is the
                    kinda stuff that always gets me in
                    trouble.

                              RACHEL
                    Hmm. So, basically you do want to
                    ask the question, `are we
                    boyfriend/girlfriend?' You're just
                    afraid you'll get an answer you
                    don't want and that will shatter
                    your illusions of how good
                    everything's been these past few
                    months. Is that about right?

                              RACHEL
                    Thomas, tell me this. Is it worse
                    to get the wrong answer now... or
                    find out in a month she has a date
                    coming up with Lars from Norway?
          
                              TOM

                              RACHEL
                    He's a professional surfer with
                    Brad Pitt's face and Jesus's abs.

                    You see what I mean?
          
          The whistle blows again and Rachel gets up to go back on the
          field.
          
                              RACHEL
                    Later dude.

                    Coach, no, wait! I need her.
                        (shouting to Rachel)
                    Rachel, what do you think I should
                    do?

          INT TOM'S CAR - THAT NIGHT
          
          Tom and Summer driving on the Golden Gate. Tom is very
          conflicted and we can see it in his face. They're silent a
          few beats, before:
          
                                SUMMER
                    Hi.
          
                                TOM
                    Hi.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Are you ok?
          
                                TOM
                    Yeah.
          
                                SUMMER
                    You sure?
          
          He's not. He clenches his teeth. And begins...
          
                               TOM
                    Summer, I've gotta ask you
                    something.
          
                                SUMMER
                    Ok.
          
          He takes a deep breath. He's about to go on when:
          
                                SUMMER
                    Wait!
          
          Summer finds on the radio a particular song. ("Waiting in
          Vain" by Bob Marley, if you must know.)
          
                               SUMMER
                    Whoa. Oh my god. We can't talk
                    during this song. It's too
                    beautiful.
          
          And it is. Tom's hand is on the gear shift. She puts hers
          there and locks it with his. Tom listens and Tom watches
          Summer listening. There's something about this moment, the
          way she sings along, the way her eyes close during certain
          notes, the way her smile rises and falls like she could cry
          at any minute from being overwhelmingly happy or just simply
          overwhelmed. Tom is powerless to stop his feelings for this
          girl.
          
                                                                    57.
          
          
          
          Marley sings:
          
                              B.M.
                    "In life I know there's lots of
                    grief/ but your love is my relief."
          
          We know, as well as he does: he will ask nothing tonight.

          INT PARTY - NIGHT
          
          Tom and Summer are in a LARGE CIRCLE OF PEOPLE at a party.
          TIME CUTS reveal that Summer is talking with, laughing with,
          drinking with, and possibly flirting with many of them. Tom
          notices, smiles, pretends it doesn't mean anything, but he's
          clearly jealous, not in a sexual way but of the attention
          they're getting from her. It's been a while. He misses that
          attention.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          (272-286)
          INT. BOOKSTORE - DAY
          
          Tom, starting to get that unshaven, unkempt look, wanders
          through the self-help section. He leafs through some of the
          titles. He grabs just about every one of them.
          
          
          INT. APARTMENT - LATER
          
          Tom has more than fifty self-help books on a shelf by his
          bed. He reads from one called "Six Steps to Getting Over
          Him."
          
                              TOM (V.O.)
                    "So he broke your heart. You've
                    been sad and depressed for weeks.
                    Perhaps you've turned to drinking
                    or even drugs. And nothing's
                    helped. Now what? Should you binge
                    on rocky road and watch soaps all
                    day?"
          
          SECONDS LATER. Tom sits in his bed eating ice cream. He
          continues to read.
          
                                                                     58.

                      "No you should not."
          
          He slowly puts the ice cream down.
          
                                TOM (V.O.)
                      "Through extensive research, we
                      have found the six most effective

          Tom jogs.
          
                                TOM (V.O.)
                      "One. Exercise. The body's release
                      of endorphins will assuage the
                      brain and provide a genuine sense
                      of accomplishment and success."
          
          Cars pass him at top speed. Bicycles breeze by him. A child
          on a big wheel soars past. He may as well be jogging in
          place.
          
          
          INT. YOGA CENTER - NIGHT
          
          Tom is taking a yoga class.
          
                                TOM (V.O.)
                      "Two. Physical and Mental

                      for a new understanding of the self
                      and others."
          
          This shit is really fucking hard when you're as inflexible as
          Tom. Everyone else in the class seems at peace. Tom can't
          even get the breathing right.
          
          
          INT. HOMELESS SHELTER - DAY
          
          Tom feels good about himself as he gives out food to the
          homeless.
          
                                TOM (V.O.)
                      "Three. Charity. Reach out! You are

          Next in line is a HOMELESS COUPLE holding hands. Tom spirits
          immediately fall. Even these two somehow found each other.
          
          
          INT SHOE STORE - DAY
          
          Tom stands in the center of a fashionable ladies shoe store.
          
                                TOM (V.O.)
                      "Four. Shoe Shopping! Ladies...you
                      know you want to. Indulge!"
          
          ANGLE ON TOM, just sorta standing there. Confused. He doesn't
          really want new shoes.
          
          
          EXT. FOREST - DAY
          
          Tom backpacks alone in the forest.
          
                                TOM (V.O.)
                      "Five. Travel. Take some time to
                      see another environment. Get
                      perspective. It's a beautiful
                      world. It will be for you again
                      someday."
          
          This is it, he's finally found some peace. Tom looks up to
          the tops of the trees where the sunlight is peeking in and
          takes a deep breath.
          
          FREEZE ON TOM.
          
          INFORMATION BUBBLES pop up on the screen to point out that
          Tom is standing in POISON OAK. There's a RUSTY BEAR TRAP a
          step ahead of him. A giant POISONOUS SNAKE creeping up
          behind him. A TICK on his leg. And in the distance a HUNTER
          has Tom sized up in his rifle sight.
          
          UNFREEZE.
          
          Tom starts to itch...

                      "Six. Redecorate. Start anew."
          
          He's focused on his task and in fact seems pretty good at it.

                    remember his face at all."
          
          We pull back to REVEAL Tom has painted a giant mural of
          Summer on his wall. He looks at the self-help book and
          dropkicks it.

          A tall, well-built, GOOD-LOOKING DOUCHEBAG GUY has suddenly
          appeared next to them.

                    Hey.
          
          Tom and Summer stop talking.
          
                                 SUMMER
                    Hey.

                                 SUMMER
                    Ok.
          
          Tom puts his hands in his pockets and watches this exchange
          go down. Not sure what else to do. At this point he's more
          amused than concerned.
          
                              DOUCHE
                    You live around here?
          
                              SUMMER
                    Yeah not too far.
          
                              DOUCHE
                    I've never seen you here before.
          
                              SUMMER
                    You're not too perceptive.
          
                              DOUCHE
                    Ha. That's funny.
          
          Tom smiles to himself. This guy's a tool. Nothing to worry
          about.
          
                              DOUCHE
                    So, uh, let me buy you a drink.
          
                              SUMMER
                    No thank you.
          
          As she answers Summer gives a quick glance over to Tom. The
          Guy notices. Up to this point he had not connected the two of
          them together.
          
                              DOUCHE
                    Are you with this guy?
          
          Tom realizes he has to sort of say something now.

                    drinking?
          
                              SUMMER
                    Sorry, no thank you.
          
          Tom is pleased.
          
                              DOUCHE
                    You're serious? This guy?
          
          And now he's pissed.
          
                              TOM
                    Hey buddy --
          
                               SUMMER
                        (to the Douche)
                    Don't be rude. I'm flattered, I'm
                    just not interested. Now why don't
                    you go back over there and leave us
                    alone, ok?
          
                              DOUCHE
                    It's a free country.
          
          Summer and Tom make eye contact again, as if to say "now
          what?" After a beat:
          
                              DOUCHE
                    So you and him, huh? I can't
                    believe that. Is this guy really
                    your boyfriend?
          
          And that question hangs in the air. Tom, panicked, decides to
          cut the silence. All the pent up uncertainty and confusion,
          coupled with the challenge to his manhood in front of the
          woman he loves, all manifests in one single, solid, almost
          automatic RIGHT CROSS TO THE GOOD LOOKING DOUCHEBAG'S FACE.
          
          Which connects spot on and sends the Douche reeling.
          
          Both Douche and Tom wince at the pain (Douche's chin, Tom's
          fist).
          
                                                                  63.
          
          
          
          There's a beat of calm where Tom is actually sorta surprised.
          And then the Douche spins around and starts PUMMELLING TOM.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT BAR - A FEW MINUTES LATER
          
          Having been thrown out, Summer and Tom exit the place. Tom is
          a bloody mess, granted, but feels pretty great about it.
          
                              TOM
                    Did you see that punch? I don't
                    know where it came from. I haven't
                    punched someone since Josh
                    Greenberg in fifth grade. Guess I'm
                    gonna have to throw out this shirt.
          
          Summer starts walking ahead and Tom notices for the first
          time she's furious.
          
                              TOM
                    Hey. What is it?
          
                              SUMMER
                    I can't believe you.
          
                              TOM
                    What?
          
                              SUMMER
                    You were so completely uncool in
                    there.
          
                              TOM
                    You're mad at me? I just got my ass
                    kicked for you.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Oh that was for me? You were, what,
                    protecting me? Next time Tommy,
                    don't. I fight my own battles.
          
                              TOM
                    Come on, that guy was an asshole!
          
                              SUMMER
                    You didn't have to hit him. Why
                    didn't you just let me handle it?
          
                              TOM
                    I don't know. He was --
          
                                                                  64.
          
          
          
                              SUMMER
                    See. This is why I don't want a
                    serious relationship.
          
                              TOM
                    Whoa. What was that?
          
                              SUMMER
                    Nothing. Look, I like you Tom. I
                    like this. What we've been doing.
                    But maybe it's gone too...
          
                                TOM
                    What...?
          
                              SUMMER
                    I told you all along what I don't
                    want and it's...
          
          Tom waits for more. It doesn't come.
          
                              SUMMER
                    I'm tired. Can we talk about this
                    tomorrow?
          
          It's silent. He doesn't know what to do or say or think.
          Neither of them say a word as they go their separate ways.
          
                              TOM
                        (calling to her)
                    I just got my ass kicked!
          
          Only the CROWD outside the bar hear this.
          
                              TOM
                        (to Onlookers)
                    I got one good shot in.
          
          
          
          (146 & 147)
          INT. OFFICE - LATER
          
          Tom is in the photocopy room with a bandage on his nose.
          Summer walks in, not realizing he would be there. She stops
          short.
          
                                TOM
                          (GENUINE)
                    Hi.

                          (COLD)
                    Hi.
          
                                   TOM
                    What's up?
          
                                   SUMMER
                    Nothing.
          
                                   TOM
                    Ok.
          
          Nothing else is said.
          
                              TOM
                    Wait, are you still mad at me?
          
                              SUMMER
                        (rolling her eyes)
                    Tom...
          
                              TOM
                    Holy shit you are. I can't believe
                    you!
          
                              SUMMER
                        (re: copies)
                    Are you almost done?
          
                              TOM
                    Yeah. I'm all done.
          
          He starts to walk out.
          
                              TOM
                    You know what... Sometimes you
                    really don't make any sense.
          
          Tom walks out. He looks back but she isn't looking. When she
          looks back at him, he's gone.
          
          LATER. Tom about to leave the office. Passes Summer's desk.
          She's on the phone. He wants to stop and say something but
          she's busy. He walks on. She never knew he was there.
          
          LATER. Summer, packed up to go, walks over to Tom's cubicle
          but he's already gone.
          
          
          SPLITSCREEN - INT. BOTH APARTMENTS - THAT NIGHT
          
          Left: Tom tosses and turns in his sleep.

          Right: Summer lies awake, staring at the ceiling.
          
          Left: Tom picks up the phone. Is about to dial when he stops
          himself and hangs up.
          
          Right: Summer looks at her phone, willing it to ring. It
          doesn't.
          
          
          INT TOM'S BEDROOM - HOURS LATER
          
          Tom is awakened by a buzzer. He hits the "sleep" button but
          the buzzing isn't coming from his alarm. It's his door. He
          gets up, concerned, and goes to answer it. It's Summer.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Say you're sorry.
          
                               TOM
                    Huh?
          
                              SUMMER
                    Say you're sorry for acting like a
                    jerk.
          
                              TOM
                    I am. I'm sorry for acting like a
                    jerk.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Ok. Me too.
          
                              TOM
                    Summer... we don't have to label
                    what we're doing. I just... I need -
          
                               SUMMER
                    I know -
          
                              TOM
                    Consistency. I need to know you
                    won't wake up tomorrow and feel a
                    different way.
          
                              SUMMER
                    I can't promise you that. Nobody
                    can. Anyone who does is a liar.
          
          A beat.
          
                              SUMMER
                    I can only tell you how I feel
                    right now... or I can show you.
          
                                                                  67.
          
          
          
          She comes in and kisses him. He thinks about it for a second.
          Is this enough to assuage his doubts? Damn it, she wins
          again. He shuts the door in our faces.
          
          
          INT TOM'S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING
          
          Tom and Summer in the wee hours.
          
                              TOM
                    Have you ever had a real
                    "boyfriend?"
          
                                 SUMMER
                    What?
          
                              TOM
                    A boyfriend. "Going steady."
                    Whatever. You know what I mean.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Well... yeah.
          
                              TOM
                    More than one?
          
                                 SUMMER
                    A few.
          
                              TOM
                    Tell me about them.
          
                                 SUMMER
                    Oh no way.
          
                                 TOM
                    Why?
          
                              SUMMER
                    Cause there's nothing to tell.
          
                              TOM
                    Come on, I'm interested.
          
                              SUMMER
                    You wanna have the relationship
                    history conversation?
          
                                 TOM
                    Yes.
          
                              SUMMER
                    You sure about that?
          
                                                                    68.
          
          
          
                              TOM
                    No. Yeah. I don't know. Why not? I
                    can take it.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Ok. Well, in high school, there was
                    Markus.
          
          INSERT: Still photograph of MARKUS. Or at least how he
          appears in Tom's mind. Arm cocked, about to throw the winning
          touchdown pass.

                    He was a rower. Very hot.
          
                              TOM
                    What happened to Markus?
          
                              SUMMER
                    He works for the Republican party.
                    Very successful. Just not for me.

                    Ok. And then?
          
                              SUMMER
                    Well, for a short time in college,
                    there was Kurt.

                    Yeah, cause, you know...
          
          Tom has no idea. And he doesn't want to know.

          right away that Tom can't wait for this night to end already.

                    Yeah.

                    You've been pretty quiet.
          
                              TOM
                    Sorry.
          
                              ALISON
                    I'm pretty quiet too. Usually. It's
                    nice sometimes to be comfortable
                    enough that you can just sit and
                    eat and not have to say anything,
                    you know?
          
                              TOM
                    Uh-huh.

                    No thanks.
          
          Alison looks at her food. Tom realizes he's been difficult,
          starts to feel kinda bad.
          
                               TOM
                    I'm sorry. It's just... there's
                    this girl.
          
                                 ALISON
                    Oh.
          
                              TOM
                    I'm not usually like this. I wasn't
                    before... Long story short, she
                    wrecked me. I don't know if you can
                    tell but it was pretty recent and
                    I'm still kinda thinking about her.
          
                              ALISON
                        (DISAPPOINTED)
                    Well maybe you should think
                    about... someone else... who could
                    cheer you up.
          
                              TOM
                    I can't get her out of my head, you
                    know? I see her everywhere. She's
                    all I think about. And it's
                    horrible. Cause I totally didn't
                    see it coming. I thought things
                    were fine. So now I keep going
                    through every day in my mind, every
                    second really. Wondering. What went
                    wrong? Is it my fault? Could I have
                    prevented it somehow?

                    A lot of people have problems with
                    this, but to me, it makes both
                    structures so much more beautiful
                    side by side like that.
          
          Tom keeps talking. Summer turns and looks directly at the
          CAMERA.

                    nod my head and pretend to listen
                    while secretly dreaming about the
                    many ways I can one day rip out
                    your heart and eat it like the

          He's sleeping like a baby, probably the best sleep he's had
          in a long while. Summer lies next to him. Wide awake. Bored
          and unfulfilled.

                    strange, that's why.
          
                              ALISON
                    It's ok. I'm sure it's tough
                    getting over an ex-girlfriend.
          
                              TOM
                    Actually she was never my
                    girlfriend.
          
          Now Alison is really confused. And it's right around the part
          where Tom starts totally cracking up.
          
                              TOM
                    I just... I thought I'd have
                    figured it out by now, you know? My
                    life. Where I'm going, where I want
                    to end up, who with. All that
                    stuff. I still don't know anything.
                    And the thing is... When I was with
                    Summer, none of that mattered. I
                    never even noticed how much of my
                    life was missing! Isn't that weird?

          He tucks his shirt into his pants. He ties his tie. He
          brushes his teeth with aplomb. He looks for, finds, and
          plucks a grey hair from his head. He makes some faces into
          the mirror.
          
          Satisfied, he grabs his coat and hits the street.

                    stay in and go to bed early.

                    you be super mad at me if we went
                    out this weekend instead?

                    maybe, go to dinner. I mean, you've

                    mind?

          keep his frustration from being audible.

                      I kinda like what Nietzsche said:
                      "There is always some madness in
                      love, but there is also...always
                      some reason in madness." Think
                      about it. Pretty smart. Although,
                      Nietzsche also said "Kill the
                      Jews." So there's that.

                        (looking at Summer)
                    Hi Mom.
          
          Summer smiles. Maybe this will be ok.
          
                              TOM
                    Mom, Martin, this is Summer.
          
                              SARAH
                    Summer! Well hello! We've heard so
                    much about you! It's so good to
                    finally meet you.
          
          Sarah hugs Summer.
          
                               SUMMER
                    You too.
          
          And now Martin weighs in with his own hug. Tom notices
          Summer's face growing increasingly concerned. Why is he
          hugging me?
          
                              MARTIN
                        (to Tom)
                    Is this the girlfriend?
          
          Tom is caught like a deer in headlights. What can he do?
          
                              TOM
                    Well this is the girl friend I've
                    told you about. I don't know if
                    "girlfriend" is the right word...
          
                              SARAH
                    You going to see the serial killer
                    one?
          
                              SUMMER
                    Yes we are.
          
                              SARAH
                    Great! Should we save you seats?
          
          Again, this has become incredibly awkward for Tom and for
          Summer.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Absolutely.
          
                                                                  82.
          
          
          
                              SARAH
                    Ok. We'll see you inside.
          
          When they're out of earshot, Tom sees that Summer is
          distraught.
          
                              TOM
                    Sorry about that.
          
                                 SUMMER
                    It's fine.
          
                              TOM
                    You wanna go do something else? We
                    can totally bolt.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Did you tell them I was your
                    girlfriend?
          
                              TOM
                    What?! No way... I never used that
                    word.
          
                              SUMMER
                    They seemed to think... I mean, why
                    is your step-dad giving me a hug?
          
                              TOM
                    He's very...loving.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Does he hug all your friends?
          
          There's that word again.
          
          Summer looks at Tom, like she's disappointed or even angry at
          him for something. Then she walks ahead of him into the
          theatre. He's forced to follow. Answer-less, as conflicted as
          ever. Why is none of this easy?
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          INT MOVIE THEATRE - LATER
          
          Summer, Tom, Sarah, Martin in a row. Summer's face is cold,
          emotionless. Tom tries to look at her, to make eye contact,
          something. She knows he's looking but it doesn't make her
          head turn his way. Tom gives up and watches the movie.
          
          ANGLE ON THE MOVIE SCREEN. We see a BLACK AND WHITE FILM.
          
                                                                  83.
          
          
          
          It's a MAN racing down the street, fleeing from an unseen
          assassin. When he turns around we see the man is TOM. Bullets
          fly and he's hit repeatedly in the back while running away
          like Belmondo in BREATHLESS. He dies an elaborate, violent,
          horrible on-screen death.
          
          
          (228)
          INT CLUB - NIGHT
          
          Rave music blares. Tom stands off to the side looking
          miserable. Summer is on the dance floor. Though she's not
          really dancing with anyone in particular, she's dancing with
          everyone. Finally she comes over, white shirt dripping with
          sweat and clearly a little high on one thing or another.
          
                              SUMMER
                    You're not having any fun.
          
                              TOM
                    You're having enough for both of
                    us.
          
                              SUMMER
                    I'm dancing. I haven't danced in
                    ages. God. Come on.
          
                              TOM
                    No.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Come on! I wanna dance with you.
          
                              TOM
                    Where were you an hour ago? I might
                    have danced then. I've been
                    standing here by myself this whole
                    time and you didn't look over once.
          
                              SUMMER
                    So you're pissed?
          
                              TOM
                    I'm not pissed. Summer... you know
                    I hate this shit.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Then why are you here?
          
                                                                     84.
          
          
          
                              TOM
                    This is what you wanted to do
                    so...we're doing it.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Yeah well, I didn't need a
                    chaperone. Go home. You're a
                    buzzkill standing there pouting.
          
                               TOM
                        (HURT)
                    That's real nice.
          
          He walks off. She feels some guilt for a second.
          
                                 SUMMER
                    Tom!
          
          But when he doesn't turn around she just shakes it off and
          starts dancing again.
          
          LATER. Tom is outside in the rain. We can still hear the
          music blaring from the club. Summer is in there. Tom is
          alone. He can't believe it's come to this.
          
          
          (251)
          FADE UP: "YOU MAKE MY DREAMS COME TRUE" by Hall and Oates.
          
          
          EXT STREET - MORNING
          
          The worst morning ever.
          
          Tom walks down the street. Or, more accurately, Tom sulks
          down the street. Though it's sunny and warm, Tom is a sad,
          broken man and the world is an awful place. There's still
          Hall and Oates following Tom, almost trying to cheer him up.
          He checks out his reflection in a window. Ron Howard's
          brother Clint looks back.
          
          Tom walks by a COUPLE making out on a bench. He grimaces.
          
          He walks by a sign that says "TODAY ONLY: FREE BEER." He
          doesn't even stop.
          
          Cartoon Bird returns but Tom swats it away.
          
          The WORLD'S MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN stops to ask him for
          directions. He doesn't even look up.
          
                                                                  85.
          
          
          
          Tom's parade of supporters, The Postman, Mayor McCheese, all
          of them shake their heads and give him disapproving looks.
          The Cartoon Bird takes a cartoon shit on Tom's shoulder. Tom
          tries to kill the bird. Can't even manage that.
          
          
          INT OFFICE - SAME
          
          He passes Summer desk on the way in. She's no longer there.
          He miserably sits down at his desk, tries to work but he ends
          up just staring into space.
          
          
          INT VANCE'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Tom has been called into the Principal's office.

                    have been a little difficult.

          He hands him some sympathy cards.

          INT TOM'S BEDROOM - MORNING
          
          Tom wakes up. He gets his bearings and then quickly rolls
          onto the floor and begins a brief push-up routine.
          
                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
                    Most days of the year are entirely
                    unremarkable. They begin and they
                    end without creating a single
                    lasting memory. Most days have no
                    real impact on the course of a
                    life.
          
          The phone rings. Tom stops his push-ups to answer it.

          extremely nervous.
          
                              TOM
                    What's going on?
          
          Neither one answers him. They look at each other. Finally...

                    We have news.
          
                              TOM
                    Ok.
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    It's about her.
          
                              TOM
                    Do I want to hear it?
          
                              PAUL
                    Thats what we wanted to ask you.
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    It's just...lately you've
                    been...better.
          
                                                                  88.

                    You've been much much better.
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    So maybe it's best we don't ever
                    bring her up again.
          
                              PAUL
                    Just let sleeping dogs lie.
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    Leave those dogs alone Tom!
          
                              TOM
                    You guys, look, I'm... I appreciate
                    what you're saying and, thank you,
                    really, for putting up with me
                    these past few months. I've been
                    crazy. But I've accepted the fact
                    that she and I were just two very
                    different people who wanted very
                    different things. I wanted to get
                    serious. Shit, I loved her. And I
                    know now, she just isn't the kind
                    of girl who can settle down with
                    one person and be happy. The way I
                    wanted. And she probably never
                    will. There was nothing I could do.
          
          Mckenzie and Paul just sit there. Now more uncomfortable than
          ever. On Tom, we:

          Tom comes charging out of the place with his friends
          following behind.
          
                              TOM

          INT TOM'S BEDROOM
          
          Tom is going apeshit in his room. He's ripping down posters,
          taking pictures out of frames and tearing them apart. He
          punches the wall. He drinks an entire bottle of red wine. He
          tries to find something to kick and can't. He throws his cell
          phone off his balcony. Finally he collapses on the bed.

          INT TOM'S BEDROOM
          
          The half-destroyed alarm clock goes off. Tom hits the off
          button.

          INT SUPERMARKET - DAY
          
          Tom, in a robe and boxer shorts, buys milk, OJ, cigarettes,
          Jack Daniels, and twinkies.
          
          The CLERK eyes him suspiciously.
          
          
          EXT STREET - SAME
          
          Tom sees a COUPLE kissing on the sidewalk. He winces. He sees
          ANOTHER COUPLE entwined on a bench. It's killing him. He sees
          a THIRD COUPLE walking towards him holding hands. He snaps.
          
                                                                  90.

                     Jesus Christ people! Get a room!
          
          They look at this lunatic in his robe and quickly walk away.

          INT TOM'S BEDROOM
          
          Alarm clock. We PAN ACROSS to see Tom is wide awake. He
          probably hasn't slept in a day or so. He has no reaction to
          the alarm.
          
          
          INT OFFICE - LATER
          
          Tom actually wanders in to work, wearing sunglasses and the
          clothes he slept in. People pass and say hello. He can't
          muster responses. At his desk,
          
                                 MCKENZIE
                     Tom!
          
          Nothing.
          
                               MCKENZIE
                     I've been calling every five
                     minutes. Are you ok?
          
                               TOM
                     What? Oh yeah. Great.
          
                               MCKENZIE
                     Do you need anything?

          INT BOARDROOM - LATER
          
          Tom sits next to McKenzie and across from Vance. He's in his
          usual boardroom position, which is to say, near comatose.
          
          A female CO-WORKER, 50s, stands at the front of the room in
          mid-presentation, showing slides that have something to do
          with a cat in various poses. First we see, "Cat Reaching Up
          for Out-of-Reach Milk Bowl."
          
                              CO-WORKER
                    This one says "Go for it!"
          
          She clicks to the next slide. "Cat Hanging From Tree Branch."
          
                              CO-WORKER
                    This one says "Don't give up!"
          
          Click. We see "Cat Considering a Giant Leap."
          
                              CO-WORKER
                    And this one says "You can do it!"
                    We have a whole line of
                    inspirational cards featuring
                    Pickles, my cat. I think people
                    will really enjoy them. Thank you.
          
          She takes her seat.

                    Good job Rhoda, I agree. Really
                    inspirational stuff. Now, who's
                    next. We haven't heard from
                    "Sympathy" in a while. Hansen...

                    This isn't inspirational. It's
                    suicidal. He tries that jump, I'm
                    writing a sympathy card for that
                    cat. That's the last thing I want
                    to be doing with my life. It's bad
                    enough writing these things for

                    Yes but think about it! Why do
                    people buy these things? Not to say
                    how they feel. There's paper and
                    pens for that. People give these
                    cards when they can't say how they
                    feel. Or they're afraid to. And we

          uncomfortable.

                    give em some truth. Something like,
                    "Sorry to hear about your
                    grandmother. Here's a card so I get
                    some credit in your time of need.
                    I'm sure it makes up for the fact

                    you." Oh that's nice.

                              TOM
                    If someone gave me this card, Mr.
                    Vance... I would eat it.
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    Tom!
          
          Tom recognizes he's losing his shit. He takes a seat on the
          boardroom table.
          
                               TOM
                        (BEAT)
                    It's these greeting cards, Sir,
                    these cards, these movies, these
                    pop songs. They're responsible for
                    all the lies, the heartache,
                    everything! We're responsible!
          Everyone shifts in their seats.
          
                               TOM
                    I think we do a bad thing here.
                    People should be able to say how
                    they feel, how they really feel,
                    without some strangers putting
                    words in their mouths. The truth. A
                    card is a nice thought but it
                    shouldn't do the dirty work for
                    you. You love someone, tell them
                    yourself, in your own words. Maybe
                    it's not love at all. Maybe there's
                    no such thing as love. Maybe
                    it's... "galoogoo."
                        (BEAT)
                    Yeah I made it up, so what?!
          
          Tom gets up and walks to the door.
          
                              TOM
                    It's all crap. We make and peddle
                    crap. And sometimes people believe
                    in this crap. I just can't do it
                    anymore, Mr. Vance. There's enough
                    bullshit in the world without my
                    help. I quit.
          
                                                                  95.
          
          
          
          And with that he gets up and walks off. The room is pretty
          stunned. Someone coughs. McKenzie tries to start a clap. It
          doesn't really take.

          Tom comes outside with some boxes. He stands out in front of
          the building. His face says one thing. "Holy shit. Did I just
          do that?!" And then we,

                               MCKENZIE
                    We know.
          
                              TOM
                    But... It's May! We broke up last
                    August.
          
                               PAUL
                    I know.
          
                               TOM
                    And you said she was single at

                                 MCKENZIE
                    Yeah.
          
                              TOM
                    Now she's getting married.
          
                              PAUL
                    I'm so sorry Tom.

                    Married?
          
                              PAUL
                    It's insane.
          
                              TOM
                    It's impossible. It doesn't make
                    sense. Where did they meet? Is it
                    someone we know?
          
                                 PAUL
                    No.
          
                              TOM
                    So everything she said. All that
                    stuff about... it can't be. Not
                    her. I know her too well. She
                    wouldn't do that.
          
          His friends say nothing.

                              TOM
                    Yup.
          
          It's silent a few beats.
          
                              TOM
                    Anyway, who cares about me? This is
                    your day.
          
          She hugs him. Tight. He doesn't cry but he could.
          
                              RACHEL
                    You know, my friends... they're all
                    in love with you.
          
                              TOM
                    Is that right?
          
                              RACHEL
                    Look.
          
          He sees a coven of 13-year olds swooning across the dance
          floor at him.
          
                              TOM
                    That's nice.
          
                                                         101.

                    What I tell ya? There are plenty
                    other fish in the sea.
          
                              TOM
                    Those are guppies.
          
                              RACHEL
                    Who knows, someday one might turn
                    out to be your "true love."
          
                              TOM
                    Are you making fun of me now?
          
                              RACHEL
                    No I'm serious.
          
                              TOM
                    I got news for you Rach. That true
                    love stuff... it's make-believe.
          
                              RACHEL
                    Well that's not very romantic.
          
                              TOM
                    It's the new me.
          
          The song ends.
          
                              TOM
                    Alright... go play with your
                    friends.
          
                              RACHEL
                    You'll be ok?
          
                              TOM
                        (LYING)
                    Sure.
          
                              RACHEL
                    Tom.
          
                              TOM
                    Hmm?
          
                               RACHEL
                    I know you think she was the
                    perfect girl for you...
                        (BEAT)
                    I don't. I think you're just
                    remembering the good stuff. But
                    what do I know, right? I'm 13.
          
                                                                    102.
          
          
          
          She blows him a kiss and then runs off and joins her girls.
          Tom watches her go.

          SPLITSCREEN - TOM'S BEDROOM/ SUMMER'S BEDROOM - MORNING
          
          Tom is wide-awake, sitting fully dressed on his bed putting
          his shoes on. He holds the phone up to his ear.
          
                                TOM
                    Hey.
          
          Summer is half-asleep under the covers. The phone lays at her
          side and she angles towards it.
          
                                SUMMER
                    Hello?
          
                              TOM
                    Are you still sleeping?

                    I'm getting up. What time is it?
          
                              TOM
                    10:30. Are we still hanging out
                    today?
          
                                SUMMER
                    Ok. Sure.

                    I'll meet you at Liberty in... 20
                    minutes?
          
                              SUMMER
                    I might need 45.
          
          
          EXT PARK - DAY
          
          Tom and Summer are having a picnic. If it looks familiar,
          it's cause we saw them here on page 7. This is that fateful
          day Tom described to his sister and his friends. The day it
          all, finally, fell apart.
          
                                                                 103.
          
          
          
                              TOM
                    So how was last night?
          
                              SUMMER
                    It was fine. Just a work thing.
          
                              TOM
                    Where did you guys go?
          
                              SUMMER
                    Some restaurant.
          
                              TOM
                    Fun?
          
                              SUMMER
                    Uneventful. Didn't get home until
                    after 12 though which is way too
                    late for a stupid work function.
                    How was your night?
          
                              TOM
                    Pretty standard.
          
          Not much more to say. Stay with them for a few extra beats of
          silence.
          
          
          EXT OUTDOOR MARKET - LATER
          
          Tom and Summer shopping at the fruit market. Unless we were
          looking for trouble we wouldn't see any. But since we are, we
          might notice she lags behind him as they walk through the
          aisles. His hands are in his pockets. He's bored. She's
          distant. But only if we're really looking.
          
          
          (406)
          INT. APARTMENT - LATER
          
          Tom, almost with a full beard, is redecorating his apartment
          again. We see him rearranging the furniture in the room.
          
          LATER. He hangs some new pictures.
          
          LATER. He uses a pencil on the wall to mark for a bookshelf.
          Then he uses a ruler to make sure his marks are even. He
          draws a faint line on the wall to mark where he needs to nail
          something.
          
                                                                   104.
          
          
          
          
          (240)
          INT COFFEE HOUSE - LATER
          
          That day again. As we've seen before, Tom reads a newspaper.
          Summer reads a novel.
          
                              TOM
                    It's playing at 5.
          
                              SUMMER
                    You want to go?
          
                              TOM
                    I don't know. You wanna maybe go
                    back to your place or ---
          
                              SUMMER
                    I want to see it. Let's go.
          
                               TOM
                    Ok cool.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Unless you don't want to.
          
                              TOM
                    No, I will. That's fine.
          
                               SUMMER
                    Ok.
          
          A few more silent beats. Something's in the air.
          
          
          INT MOVIE - LATER
          
          Tom and Summer watching the film. Tears begin to well in
          Summer's eyes. They soon turn to audible sobs. Tom turns to
          look at her, to offer some sort of comfort, believing it to
          be a response to the movie. She doesn't look back.
          
          
          (409)
          INT TOM'S BEDROOM - DAY
          
          Tom drawing a straight line on his wall. Redecorating.
          
                                                                 105.
          
          
          
          And then he stops.
          
          He looks at the line he's drawn. He extends it a little bit.
          He draws another. He begins to furiously draw on the wall.
          From out of nowhere, inspiration has hit. An image starts to
          form. A pretty impressive looking futuristic skyscraper,
          almost shaped like a tear drop.
          
          
          (240)
          EXT MOVIE THEATRE - LATER
          
          Same day from the past. They walk out, at first everything's
          alright. It's exactly as we saw on page 7. But soon after
          that she begins to cry again. Serious, real sobbing.
          
                                 TOM
                       Hey.
          
          He goes to hug her. He hugs her. It's unclear if she hugs
          back.
          
                                 TOM
                       Hey Sum, it's just a movie.
          
                                 SUMMER
                       I know. I'm sorry Tom.
          
                                 TOM
                       Is everything alright with you?
          
          She smiles, tries to pull herself together.
          
                                 SUMMER
                       Yeah. I'm just...I'm sorry. I'm
                       being ridiculous.
          
                                 TOM
                       It's ok. This happens to me every
                       time I watch "Hoosiers." Let's go
                       for a walk, ok. Let's get some air.
                       Or go to Sister Ray's.
          
                                 SUMMER
                       Ok.
          
          They walk.
          
                                                                    106.
          
          
          
          
          INT RECORD STORE - NIGHT
          
          Tom and a much more in control Summer walk down the aisles.
          He grabs one.
          
                               TOM
                    It pains me that we live in a world
                    where no one's ever heard of
                    Spearmint.
          
                              SUMMER
                    I've never heard of them.
          
                              TOM
                    And it's painful. Oh look.
          
          He grabs a Ringo Starr album and shows it to her, just as
          we've seen on Page 7. She smiles and they continue on down
          the aisles.
          
          In CU, Tom goes to hold Summer's hand. But something happens.
          It could be a total coincidence, but just as his hand
          approaches hers (in SLO-MO), she moves it away and keeps it
          at her side. Tom puts his hands in his pockets, unsure if
          there's something to read in that.
          
          
          (411)
          EXT HARBOR - DAY
          
          Tom sketches intensely. The landscape, the skyline, the
          works. He's in the zone.
          
          
          (240)
          EXT RECORD STORE - LATER
          
          Again, that fateful day continues. Tom and Summer outside.
          
                              SUMMER
                    So.
          
                              TOM
                    So... Now what?
          
                                                                 107.
          
          
          
                              SUMMER
                    Now...I think I'm gonna call it a
                    day.
          
                              TOM
                    Yeah? You wanna maybe...get some
                    dinner or something?
          
                              SUMMER
                    I've got pasta at home.
          
                              TOM
                    Are you hungry?
          
                              SUMMER
                    I'm pretty hungry, but --
          
                                TOM
                    Ooh!
          
                                SUMMER
                    What?
          
                              TOM
                    I've got a great idea!
          
                                SUMMER
                    What?
          
                              TOM
                    Let's get breakfast.
          
                                SUMMER
                    Now?
          
                                TOM
                    Pancakes?
          
          Summer's resistance is futile. And the rest as they say is
          history.
          
          FADE UP: "Number Two" by the Pernice Brothers. Which plays
          OVER:
          
          
          (417-464)
          1. INT TOM'S BATHROOM - DAY
          
          Tom shaves. Makes himself look presentable.
          
                                                                 108.
          
          
          
          LATER. Tom, now clean shaven and looking like he did when we
          first met him, sketches on his bed with one hand while
          holding a phone with the other.
          
          
          2. EXT CITY SIDEWALK - DAY
          
          Tom sits on a street corner drawing new additions to the
          city's skyline.
          
          2. INT LIBRARY - DAY
          
          Tom sits with his feet up on a table, headphones on his ears,
          reading one of many Taschen books on innovative building
          design.
          
          
          3. INT OFFICE LOBBY - DAY
          
          Tom drops off his portfolio with the security guard in the
          lobby of a high-rise.
          
          
          4. EXT SOCCER FIELD - DAY
          
          Tom and his mom and step-dad cheer on his sister playing
          soccer. It's a nice temporary distraction for him.
          
          
          6. INT TOM'S BEDROOM - DAY
          
          Tom getting bad news on the phone. He has a list written on
          his wall (which is now composed of a dynamic cityscape of
          futuristic looking structures). He crosses "Abrams and
          Abrams" off the list. We notice several others are also
          crossed off.
          
          
          5. EXT GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DAY
          
          Tom has his car on the side of the road and is out measuring
          the distance between the beams of the bridge.
          
          8. EXT PARK - DAY
          
          Tom jogs. A little faster this time.
          
          9. INT TOM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Tom getting more bad news from the answering machine,
          crossing off yet another firm from the list. Few remain. He
          sits on the bed with his shoulders slumped. For a beat, lost
          in thought.
          
                                                                    109.
          
          
          Then, as if to shut those thoughts out, whatever they were,
          he turns on the TV and joylessly watches the nothingness.
          
          
          9. SPLITSCREEN - DAY
          
          On the LEFT, Tom, alone, on a bus. Looking out the window.
          Thinking.
          
          On the RIGHT, Summer. In her wedding dress. The veil is
          lifted. And she's a bride.
          
          END MUSIC.
          
          
          (478)
          EXT OFFICE BUILDING - ANOTHER DAY
          
          Tom, in a suit, exits a building after another dismal
          interview. We can see he is frustrated but not deterred. In
          the distance, his favorite spot in the city, where he took
          Summer ages ago.
          
          
          EXT. PARK - DAY
          
          Tom walks over and sits down on a bench. He stares off, lost
          in thought. And then, from out of nowhere, there's her voice.
          
                                 SUMMER (V.O.)
                       Hey.
          
          Summer sits like an apparition on a neighboring bench. She
          may have just sat down, she may have been there for hours.
          Tom isn't sure if she's real. He doesn't quite know what to
          do.
          
                                 SUMMER
                           (re: suit)
                       Where you coming from?
          
                                 TOM
                       What? Oh. Nowhere. How long have
                       you been sitting there?
          
                                 SUMMER
                       Awhile.
          
          Tom finds it hard to look at her.
          
                                                                   110.
          
          
          
                              SUMMER
                    I come here a lot. I always loved
                    this place, ever since you brought
                    me here.
          
          The mention of their past makes the atmosphere frosty.
          
                              TOM
                    So... I should probably say
                    congratulations.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Probably. But only if you mean it.
          
                              TOM
                    I don't know if I do honestly.
          
                              SUMMER
                    I understand.
          
                              TOM
                    Yeah well...anyway...I hope you're
                    happy.
          
                              SUMMER
                    You really do?
          
                                 TOM
                        (BEAT)
                    God no.
          
          They both laugh a little. The tension begins to dissipate.
          
                              SUMMER
                    How are you, Tom?
          
                              TOM
                    I'm good. Ish.
          
                              SUMMER
                    That's good.
          
                              TOM
                    Yeah I quit the office.
          
                               SUMMER
                    Really? That's great! What are you
                    doing now?
          
                              TOM
                    Mostly...sleeping. Breaking things.
          
          Awkward silence.
          
                                                                 111.
          
          
          
                              TOM
                    So who's the guy?
          
                              SUMMER
                    Who, my guy?
          
                              TOM
                    Yeah... Wait. Don't tell me. I
                    don't want to know.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Tom...
          
                              TOM
                    No really, I don't.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Ok.
          
          More awkward silence. This one goes on a beat longer. And
          THEN:
          
                              TOM
                    It's amazing to me. You're married.
          
                              SUMMER
                    I know.
          
                              TOM
                    You're not only someone's
                    girlfriend, your someone's wife!
          
                              SUMMER
                    Pretty crazy, huh?
          
                              TOM
                        (SIGHS)
                    I'll never understand that.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Tom --
          
                              TOM
                    What's different now? How could
                    things change so quickly?
          
                              SUMMER
                    I don't know. It just happened.
          
                              TOM
                    What happened?! That's what I don't
                    get.
          
                                                                 112.
          
          
          
                              SUMMER
                    I... Tom...
          
                              TOM
                    What, tell me...
          
                              SUMMER
                    I woke up one day and I knew.
          
          Tom says nothing.
          
                              SUMMER
                    I knew I could promise him I'd feel
                    the same way every morning. In a
                    way that I... I never could with
                    you.
          
          And there's not much else to say after that.
          
          Tom gets up to leave.
          
                              TOM
                    You know what sucks? Realizing that
                    everything you believe in is
                    complete bullshit.
          
                               SUMMER
                    What is?
          
                              TOM
                    Destiny, soulmates, true love. All
                    that stuff. It's nothing more than
                    silly childhood fairy tale
                    nonsense, isn't it? God!
          
                              SUMMER
                    Tom, don't go.
          
                              TOM
                    I should have listened to you,
                    Summer. You were right all along.
          
          Summer takes a beat to let this hang there.
          
                              SUMMER
                    I was right?
          
          And then, out of nowhere, she begins to hysterically laugh.
          
                              TOM
                    What? This is funny?
          
                                                                  113.
          
          
          
          Tries to stop but it only makes it worse. Now's she's
          completely cracking up.
          
                              TOM
                    What are you laughing at?
          
          And she can't stop. She's totally lost control.
          
                              TOM
                        (trying himself not to
                         LAUGH)
                    You're a crazy person!
          
                              SUMMER
                    Tom! You're the crazy person!
          
                              TOM
                    What are you talking about?!
          
                              SUMMER
                    One day I'm reading a book at the
                    corner deli and this guy sits down
                    and starts asking about it. Now
                    he's my husband!
          
                              TOM
                    This is funny to you?
          
                               SUMMER
                    What would have happened if I went
                    to the movies instead? If I went
                    somewhere else for lunch? If I
                    showed up to eat ten minutes later?
                    Tom, it was meant to be, just like
                    you said. And as it was happening,
                    I knew it. I could feel it, sure as
                    the sun. And I kept thinking to
                    myself "Holy shit. Tom was right."
                    You were right about all of it.
                        (BEAT)
                    It just wasn't me you were right
                    about.
          
          Tom is speechless. Summer takes his hand. We may notice her
          wedding ring. We may also notice that this is the same exact
          shot as the first scene of the screenplay. We hold it for a
          few seconds more. And then, the hands separate.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Anyway, I should probably be
                    getting back. It was good to see
                    you. I'm glad you're well.
          
                                                                 114.
          
          
          
          Summer gets up and starts walking away from him. After a
          SECOND:
          
                                 TOM
                       Summer!
          
          She stops and turns back. He takes in her face, most likely
          for the last time ever.
          
                                 TOM
                       I really do hope you're happy.
          
                                  SUMMER
                       I know.
                           (BEAT)
                       See you later.
          
          And she walks away. The CAMERA TRACKS AWAY with her, leaving
          Tom alone in the park, getting smaller and farther away every
          second.
          
                                                          FADE OUT:
          
          
          A FEW SECONDS OF BLACK, BEFORE...
          
                                                           FADE IN:
          
          
          (500)
          INT OFFICE WAITING AREA - DAY
          
          Tom, in a suit, with a hefty batch of architecture sketches
          at his side, waits in the foyer of Allen, Prince, and Gethers
          Architecture. From the room we can tell this firm is big
          time.
          
          Tom waits.
          
          We notice, before he does, a VERY CUTE GIRL sitting in a
          another chair, also waiting. She smiles. He smiles back.
          
                                 GIRL
                       Are you here to interview?
          
                                 TOM
                       Sorry?
          
                                                                 115.
          
          
          
                              GIRL
                    Are you interviewing? For the
                    position?
          
                              TOM
                    Oh. Yeah. Why, are you?
          
                                 GIRL
                    Yup.
          
                              TOM
                    Ah. My competition.
          
                              GIRL
                    It would appear.
          
                              TOM
                    Gee, this is a little awkward.
          
                                 GIRL
                    Yes it is.
          
                              TOM
                    Well, I hope you don't get it.
          
                              GIRL
                    I hope you don't get it.
          They both laugh. There's a silence for a few beats. And it's
          during this time that something weird comes over Tom and we
          can visibly see it in his face. He likes the look of this
          girl. This girl is cute. He'd like to talk more with her.
          And, honestly, he's a little surprised by it.
          
                                 TOM
                    So, uh...
          
                                 GIRL
                    Hmm?
          
                              TOM
                    Are you from...California?
          
                              GIRL
                    Grew up not too far from here.
                    Atherton, near Stanford.
          
                              TOM
                    I know Atherton. Nice area.
          
                              GIRL
                    Have I seen you before?
          
                                                                 116.
          
          
          
                              TOM
                    I, uh, don't know. I don't think
                    so.
          
                              GIRL
                    Do you go to St. Patrick's? Not to
                    pray or anything but to stand
                    outside?
          
                              TOM
                    I do! I love that church. It's like
                    my favorite structure in the city.
          
                              GIRL
                    If only it wasn't near that
                    horrible mirrored thing...
          
                              TOM
                    Yes! Exactly. I totally agree!
          
                               GIRL
                    Yeah.
                        (BEAT)
                    I think I've seen you there.
          
                              TOM
                    You have? Really? Hmm. I didn't see
                    you.
          
                              GIRL
                    It happens. You probably weren't
                    looking.
          
          A MAN comes out.
          
                              MAN
                    Tom Hansen?
          
                                 TOM
                    Yes.
          
                              MAN
                    Come on back.
          
                                 TOM
                    Thank you.
          
          He starts to go. But halfway through the doorway, he pauses
          and looks back at the girl.
          
                                                                 117.
          
          
          
                              NARRATOR
                    If Tom had learned anything... it
                    was that you can't ascribe great
                    cosmic significance to a simple
                    earthly event. Coincidence. That's
                    all anything ever is. Nothing more
                    than coincidence.
          
          ANIMATION. 1 second clip of the colored sequence. Real fast.
          Hardly noticeable. But it's there.
          
                               NARRATOR
                    It took a long time but Tom had
                    finally learned. There are no
                    miracles. There's no such thing as
                    fate. Nothing is meant to be. He
                    knew. He was sure of it now.
                        (BEAT)
                    Tom was...
          
          Tom turns back around.
          
                              NARRATOR
                    ...pretty sure.
          
                               TOM
                        (to Girl)
                    Excuse me.
          
                              GIRL
                    Hello stranger.
          
                              TOM
                    When this is over... uh... would
                    you like to maybe...grab a cup of
                    coffee or something?
          
                              GIRL
                    Oh. I'm sorta supposed to meet
                    someone.
          
                              TOM
                        (DEFLATED)
                    Oh. Got it... No problem.
          
          He turns back around and shakes that off, tries to refocus on
          the task at hand. A job interview. And then he hears.
          
                              GIRL
                    Ok.
          
          Tom turns back around.
          
                                                                118.
          
          
          
                               TOM
                     What's that?
          
                                GIRL
                     Why not?
          
                                TOM
                     Yeah?
          
                                GIRL
                     Yeah.
          
                               TOM
                     Great! So... I'll wait for you
                     here, or you wait for me
                     or...something.
          
          She laughs. She's cute when she laughs.
          
                               GIRL
                     We'll figure it out.
          
                                TOM
                     Ok!
                         (extends hand to shake)
                     My name's Tom.
          
                               GIRL
                     Nice to meet you...
          
          She puts out her hand to meet his. They shake.
          
                               GIRL
                     I'm Autumn.
          
          And on his face...
          
                                                      SMASH CUT TO:
