          FADE IN:
                         
                         
          EXT. PARIS FRANCE - PONT DE BIR-HAKEIM - DAY
                         
          PAUL (50's) stands on the street under a RAISED TRAIN BRIDGE.
          He covers his ears in UTTER DISGUST at the UNBEARABLE NOISE a
          train makes as it ROARS OVERHEAD.
                         
          He BELLOWS TO THE HEAVENS.
                         
                          PAUL
                          (ENGLISH)
           FUCKING GOD!!!!
                         
          As the train moves on he walks, slowly, DESPONDENT. Lost in a
          private WORLD OF PAIN.
                         
          Behind him we see a woman in a fur collard coat and flowered
          hat walking, gaining on him. This is JEANNE (20's).
                         
          As she PASSES Paul, she turns to GLANCE at him. We read a
          HINT of EMPATHY on her face.
                         
          He is OBLIVIOUS to her or anything else for that matter.
                         
          She walks on, dodging STREET SWEEPERS as she covers the long
          walkway, trying to forget the SAD MAN she saw.
                         
          We see her walk toward a 6 story APARTMENT BUILDING.
                         
          Paul, with TEARS STREAMING DOWN HIS FACE, comes to reality as
          he also notices the building. He REGARDS it.

          EXT. APT. BUILDING - PASSEY - DAY
                         
          Jeanne stands looking at the grandeur of the building at 1
          RUE JULES VERNE. She reads a FOR RENT sign on the door frame.
          She HESITATES but then RINGS THE BELL. She checks her watch.
                         
          She SMILES to herself then descends the nearby stairs.
                         
          She goes into a BAR.

          INT. KENNEDY EIFFEL BAR - DAY
                         
          Jeanne comes in and speaks to the BARTENDER.

          DIALOGUE IS IN FRENCH
                         
                          JEANNE
           A phone token, please.
                         
                          BARTENDER
           No tokens. At the end, on the left.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Thank you.
                         
          Jeanne goes to the TELEPHONE/WASHROOM.
                         
          The telephone booth is OCCUPIED.
                         
          As she waits, she watches in disgust as an OLD LADY cleans
          her DENTURES with a toothbrush and then puts them back in her
          mouth.
                         
          Jeanne STUDIES her own face in the MIRROR, puffing her cheeks
          up in judgement. As she does, Paul exits the phone booth,
          still LOST IN ANGUISH.
                         
          After watching him leave, Jeanne USES THE PAY PHONE. She
          speaks to her MOM.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Mama? Yes, it's Jeanne. I've found
           a flat to rent in Passy. I'm going
           to see it.
                         
          She puts her foot up on the seat. We see her LONG BOOTS as
          her SHORT SKIRT hikes up.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Then I've got to go to the station
           to met Tom. I promised him. OK, see
           you later. Bye!

          INT. APT. BUILDING - FRONT DESK
                         
          Jeanne talks to THE CRAZY CONCIERGE through a SMALL WINDOW
          who is SMOKING and has ROLLERS in her hair.
                         
                          JEANNE
           I've come to see the flat. I saw
           the sign.
                         
                          CONCIERGE
           The sign?
           3.
                         
                         
                          JEANNE
           Yes.
                         
          The Concierge joins Jeanne AT THE WINDOW.
                         
                          CONCIERGE
           It's always the same! Nobody ever
           tells me anything.
                         
                          JEANNE
           I'd like to see it.
                         
                          CONCIERGE
           You want to rent it?
                         
                          JEANNE
           I don't know yet!
                         
                          CONCIERGE
           They rent, they leave and I'm the
           last to know. Do you think that's
           right?
                         
          She sits at her desk and PUTS OUT HER CIGARETTE.
                         
                          CONCIERGE (CONT'D)
           If you want to go up alone--
                         
          She looks through her KEYS...
                         
                          CONCIERGE (CONT'D)
           Go on. I'm afraid of spiders. The
           key is missing. Strange things
           happen.
          One of the APT. GUESTS puts an empty WINE BOTTLE outside
          their door. They both TAKE NOTICE.
                         
                          CONCIERGE (CONT'D)
           They drink six bottles a day.
                         
          Jeanne thinks the place is like a FUNNY FARM. As the
          concierge TRILLS OUT FIGARO, she gives up and walks away.
                         
                          CONCIERGE (CONT'D)
           Wait! Don't go! There must be a
           duplicate.
                         
          She looks for it.
                         
                          CONCIERGE (CONT'D)
           Here it is.
           4.
                         
                         
          Jeanne, against her better judgement, goes back to the desk.
          She holds out her hand. The Concierge puts the KEY IN HER
          HAND.
                         
                          CONCIERGE (CONT'D)
           You must be very young.
                         
          She GRABS AND HOLDS ON to Jeanne's hand way too long,
          LAUGHING CRAZY, HYSTERICAL. Jeanne has to forcefully break
          away from her grasp.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Let go of me!
                         
          She gets free of her and heads to the ELEVATOR, rubbing her
          hand.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           She's crazy!
                         
          The ELEVATOR arrives and she gets on. We watch her ascend and
          DISAPPEAR.

          Jeanne comes in the DARK ROOM and heads straight for the
          window. She opens it and the STORM SHUTTER.
                         
          Light STREAMS IN, revealing Paul, sitting on the RADIATOR.
                         
          Jeanne is STARTLED when she sees him.

           Who are you?
                         
          No response.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           You gave me a fright.
                         
          No response.

           How did you get in?
                         
          He replies WITHOUT LOOKING AT HER.

           Through the door.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Oh yes, I left it open. I didn't
           hear you come in.
                         
                          PAUL
           I was already here.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Sorry? Oh it was you who took it. I
           had to bribe the concierge. These
           old houses are fascinating.
                         
          She walks up to the FIREPLACE.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           An armchair by the fireplace would
           look good.
                         
                          PAUL
           The armchair should go in front of
           the window.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Are you American? You've got an
           American accent.
                         
          He gets off the radiator and WANDERS into the next room for
          SOLITUDE.

          But she has followed him. She OPENS THOSE WINDOWS also. He is
          forced into ANOTHER ROOM.

          As he studies a WICKER CHAISE LOUNGE, she calls from the
          other room.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Are you going to take it? Are you?
                         
                          PAUL
           I don't know.
                         
          She continues to LOOK AROUND. Her CURIOSITY of Paul gets the
          best of her. She peeks around the corner and watches him SIT
          IN THE CORNER.

           What are you doing?
                         
          She thinks he is VERY ODD as he PLAYS WITH a lamp shade.

          As the PHONE RINGS, she pulls up her skirt and sits on the
          toilet for a PEE. She looks around.
                         
          She finishes and FLUSHES THE TOILET as the PHONE RINGS ON
          incessantly.

           Hello -- Hello. There's no-one
           here. There's no-one. I don't know.
          He puts the SMALL LAMP SHADE back. He hangs the receiver on
          the back of the chaise. Jeanne continues to listen on her
          end, UNAWARE.
                         
          Paul SNEAKS AROUND THE CORNER.

          Jeanne is STARTLED. She hangs up the phone.
                         
                          JEANNE
           So you're going to take it? You've
           decided?
                         
                          PAUL
           I had already decided. But I'm not
           sure now. Do you like it?
                         
          She's SPEECHLESS.

                          JEANNE
           I don't know. I shall have to think
           about it.
                         
                          PAUL
           Think fast.
                         
          He WALKS OFF.
                         
          Jeanne picks her hat off the floor, lost in CONFUSION.
                         
          The front door SLAMS.
                         
          She walks toward the door...
                         
          But Paul didn't really leave. He walks slowly TOWARD HER.
                         
                          JEANNE
           I thought you'd left.
                         
          He STUDIES HER for a moment. He takes her hat and DROPS IT on
          the ground. He PICKS HER UP in his arms and CARRIES to the
          window. He puts her down on the window sill. They start
          MAKING OUT ferociously.
                         
          He RIPS her panty hose, UNDOES HIS ZIPPER and PENETRATES HER.
          They are lost in ANIMALISTIC SEX as she WRAPS HER legs around
          him.
                         
                          PAUL
           Ah... Oh, God.
                         
          They KISS SAVAGELY and HIT the floor as THEY CLIMAX TOGETHER.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Oh, Jesus... Oh... Oh, Christ.
                         
          Totally spent, they ROLL AWAY from each other. Her skirt,
          hiked up is showing her ripped panty hose. We can see her
          AMPLE BUSH through the SHEER FABRIC.
                         
          They WRITHE on the floor trying to CATCH THEIR BREATH.

          Jeanne LAGS behind, trying to fix herself also.

          heads off, still STUPEFIED.
                         
          He watches her descend the stairs and throws the CRUMPLED UP

          They go their SEPARATE WAYS. Jeanne crosses the street while
          Paul takes the RAISED WALKWAY.

          runs into his arms like LONG LOST LOVERS.
                         
          All of the sudden, a FILM CREW appears, filming their every
          moment.
                         
          They KISS PASSIONATELY.
                         
          Tom tries to UNTANGLE HER from the cords.

                          TOM
           Yeah, but I wanted...
                         
          Jeanne SMACKS THE MICROPHONE out of their faces.

           I wanted to start with shots of
           Jeanne at the station meeting her
           fiancé. Yes, I know them. They're
           my crew.
                         
                          JEANNE
           So you kissed me, and you knew it
           was being filmed. You're a bastard!
           Traitor!
                         
                          TOM
           No, you'll see. It will be a love
           story. Tell me, Jeanne, darling.
           What did you do while I was away?
                         
                          JEANNE
           I thought of you day and night, and
           I cried. Darling, I can't live
           without you!

           Wonderful! Cut! That was perfect!
                         
          He is THRILLED. He tries to kiss her but she won't let him.
          She is still MIFFED. But she finally GIVES IN. They have a

          Paul sits on the other side of the PRIVACY SCREEN --
          REFLECTING, in a GLUM FOG, listening.

          She WRINGS OUT a washcloth frequently as she speaks. The
          EXCESSIVE BLOOD AND WATER falling into a BUCKET.
                         
                          CATHERINE
           I'd have finished by now, but the
           police wouldn't let me touch
           anything. They didn't believe it
           was suicide.
                         
          She WIPES A MIRROR.
                         
                          CATHERINE (CONT'D)
           There was so much blood everywhere.
           They had fun making me do a
           reconstruction. "She went there."
                         
          She wipes another GLASS SURFACE.
                         
                          CATHERINE (CONT'D)
           "She came through here."
                         
          She opens the curtain to the SHOWER/TUB. It's INUNDATED with
          BLOOD.
                         
                          CATHERINE (CONT'D)
           "She opened the curtain."
                         
          She STARES at the blood... It's so much. She uses the SHOWER
          HEAD to rinse the blood off the tub.
                         
                          CATHERINE (CONT'D)
           I copied all her actions. The
           guests were awake all night! The
           hotel was crawling with cops! They
           enjoy playing around with blood.
          She rinses the blood FROM HER HANDS AND ARMS.
                         
                          CATHERINE (CONT'D)
           They were all spies! Asking if she
           was sad, if she was happy, if you
           fought, how long you'd been
           married, why you didn't have any
           children. Pigs!
                         
          Disgusted and exhausted, she sits on the edge of the tub. We
          switch to PAUL'S SIDE of the PRIVACY SCREEN. We see he is
          DEEPLY DISTURBED by this situation.

           said, "Your boss is a bit
           unstable." "Do you know that he was

          She begins to clean blood from THE STRAIGHT RAZOR Paul's wife
          used to KILL HERSELF WITH.

           woman with money, marries her
           and... "Since then what has your
           boss done?" "Nothing."
                         
          Paul pulls the curtains aside from the window. He looks out.
          He SPIES a BLACK COUPLE, one a SAX PLAYER, in an adjacent
          building. She is attempting ORAL SEX on him.
                         
                          CATHERINE (CONT'D)
           I say, "Can I clean up now?" "No!
           Don't touch anything!" "Do you
           really think she killed herself?"
           He pushed me into a corner and
           tried to paw me...
                         
          When the couple are spotted, they stop. He starts PLAYING HIS
          SAX.
                         
          Paul has had enough of the running water and her cleaning.

           Turn the tap off now.
                          CATHERINE
           They'll be doing the autopsy right
           now.
                         
          Paul walks to her side.
                         
                          PAUL
           Why won't you turn the tap off?
                         
                          CATHERINE
           They told me to give you your razor
           back.
                         
          She hands him the STRAIGHT RAZOR. He STUDIES IT.

           more. The investigation is over.
                         
          He grabs her hands VIOLENTLY and studies them.
                         
                          CATHERINE (CONT'D)

          the SHOWER CURTAIN closed.
                         
          He storms out of the bathroom, leaving Catherine there.

          The rest of her peeks in. She SPIES A CAT. She decides to
          make CRAZY NOISES at the animal, CRAWLING ON THE FLOOR,
          making it RUN FOR THE HILLS.

           In front of the fireplace.
                         
          She heads to the front door but is stopped by...
                         
                          MOVER 2
           Careful, madame.
                         
          With and armfull of chairs.
                         
                          JEANNE
           There.
                         
          She tries to leave again but then runs into...
                         
                          MOVER
           What about the table?
                         
          With a table.
                         
                          JEANNE
           How do I know? He'll decide.
                         
                         
          BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Jeanne REGARDS the room.
                          MOVER 2
           This is a king-size.
                         
                          JEANNE
           It won't fit!
                         
                          MOVER
           Well, your husband has no idea. All
           this in an hour... It's not long.
                         
          She leans against a wall and looks around, FLABBERGASTED.
                         
                          JEANNE
           What a mess!
                         
          We see Paul in the DOORWAY paying the movers.
                         
                          MOVER
           Thank you.
           14.
                         
                         
                          MOVER 2
           Thank you.
                         
          He comes in.
                         
          LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Jeanne is sitting in the chair in front of the fire place.
                         
                          PAUL
           The armchair goes in front of the
           window.
                         
          He DRAGS THE CHAIR AND HER to the window instead.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Like that.
                         
                          JEANNE
           But I only came to return the key.
           To return it to you.
                         
                          PAUL
           I don't care about the key. Take
           your coat off.
                         
          He takes his COAT OFF and hangs it on a DOOR HANDLE.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Take your coat off and help me.
                         
                          JEANNE
           OK.
                         
                          PAUL
           Get those chairs and bring them
           here.
                         
          He grabs the TABLE and brings it to the DINING ROOM.
                         
          DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          He places the table. She FOLLOWS with the CHAIRS.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Put them on the other side. Take
           that, too. That's it.
                         
                          JEANNE
           You didn't waste any time...
                         
          But he has WANDERED OFF to another room.
           15.
                         
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Listen monsieur! I've got to go.
                         
          DIALOGUE TO ENGLISH
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Look, sir! I've got to go!
                         
          BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          She walks across the mattresses with her BOOTS ON. Paul leans
          against the wall STUDYING THE ROOM.
                         
                          PAUL
           The bed is too big for the room.
                         
                          JEANNE
           I don't know what to call you.
                         
                          PAUL
           I don't have a name.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Do you want to know mine?
                         
                          PAUL
           No, no! I don't. I don't want to
           know your name.
                         
          He COVERS HER MOUTH and backs her up agianst a WALL.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           You don't have a name and I don't
           have a name either. Not one name.
          She THROWS HIS HAND off and puts some space between them.
                         
                          JEANNE
           You're crazy!
                         
          She leans against the adjacent wall.
                         
                          PAUL
           Maybe I am, but I don't want to
           know anything about you. I don't
           wanna know where you live or where
           you come from. I wanna know
           nothing, nothing, nothing...
                         
                          JEANNE
           You scare me.
                         
          Back to the OTHER WALL.
           16.
                         
                         
                          PAUL
           You and I are gonna meet here
           without knowing anything that goes
           on outside here.
                         
          He indicates OUTSIDE THE WINDOW.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           OK?
                         
                          JEANNE
           But why?
                         
                          PAUL
           Because... Because we don't need
           names here. Don't you see? We're
           gonna forget... everything that we
           knew. Every... All the people,...
           all that we do,... wherever we
           live. We're going to forget that,
           everything, everything.
                         
                          JEANNE
           But I can't. Can you?
                         
                          PAUL
           I don't know. Are you scared?
                         
                          JEANNE
           No.
                         
          She walks to the bed, inviting him with her eyes.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Come?
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. HOTEL - PAUL AND ROSA'S ROOM - DAY
                         
          ROSA'S MOTHER roots through Paul and Rosa's belongings.
          Searching for answers... and maybe some tokens of her
          DECEASED DAUGHTER.
                         
          Paul WAITS, listening in the HALLWAY. He loathes the upcoming
          reunion.
                         
          ANNOYED by all the RATTLING while she searches, he bites the
          bullet and GOES IN.
                         
          He CATCHES her in the ARMOIRE...
                         
          She stops her ROOTING.
           17.
                         
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           I thought you'd be here.
                         
                          PAUL
           I expected you later.
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           I took the first train.
                         
          We notice the IRONY of the SIGN ON THE DOOR, it reads "PRIVY"
          (PRIVATE).
                         
           ROSA'S MOTHER (CONT'D)
           Oh, Paul! How awful! How awful,
           Paul!
                         
          She walks TIMIDLY up to Paul. After a moment, they EMBRACE
          each other in a GRIEF STRICKEN HUG.
                         
                         MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Paul grows BORED of the reunion, he TAPS HIS FINGERS on the
          closet he LEANS AGAINST, studying the accessories of the
          DECOR and her silly hat.
                         
          She sits, SPILLING HER GRIEF on Paul as if it is a THERAPY
          SESSION.
                         
           ROSA'S MOTHER (CONT'D)
           Papa is in bed with asthma. The
           doctor wouldn't let him come. It's
           better like that. I'm stronger.
                         
          She starts RUMMAGING AGAIN, this time through Rosa's empty
          PURSES, spilling them out one at a time on the bed BEHIND
          PAUL.
                         
                          PAUL
           What are you looking for?
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           Something that would explain... A
           letter, a clue.
                         
                          PAUL
           Nothing. I told you, there's
           nothing, nothing at all.
                         
          He takes the purses and PUTS THEM BACK. She sits on the bed
          in DESPAIR.
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           My little Rosa wouldn't have...
           Nothing for her mother. Not a word.
           18.
                         
                         
                          PAUL
           It's useless to keep on searching.
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           Not even for you, her husband!
                         
          He closes the ARMOIRE.
                         
                          PAUL
           You need to rest. I think room
           12 is free.
                         
          He GATHERS HER BELONGINGS and leads her UP THE STAIRS.
                         
          STAIRS - CONTINUOUS
                         
          They pass some GUESTS coming down.
                         
                          GUEST
           Hi.
                         
          Rosa's Mother stops on the stairway, REFLECTING PAINFULLY.
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
                         
           ROSA'S MOTHER (CONT'D)
           With a razor?
                         
          Paul goes on, IGNORING HER.
                         
          ROOM 12 - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Paul comes in and puts her belongings on the BED.
                         
           ROSA'S MOTHER (CONT'D)
           What time did it happen?
                         
                          PAUL
           I don't know. In the evening.
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           And then?
                         
                          PAUL
           Then I... I already told you on the
           phone... When I found her, I called
           the ambulance.
                         
          Paul goes out to the HALLWAY to gather himself.
           19.
                         
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           After you called, Papa and I stayed
           up all night, talking about Rosa
           and you. Papa kept whispering, as
           if it had happened in our house.
                         
          Rosa's mother thinks he LEFT. She YELLS.
                         
           ROSA'S MOTHER (CONT'D)
           Paul!
                         
          Paul is BROKEN OUT OF HIS TRANCE... the sudden yelling has
          INCENSED HIM.
                         
          He PEERS ANGRILY at her in room 12.
                         
           ROSA'S MOTHER (CONT'D)
           Where did it happen?

                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           Did she suffer?
                         
                          PAUL
           Ask the Doctors. They're doing the
           autopsy.
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           The autopsy.
                         
          He goes into the ...
          BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          He turns off the ANNOYING RUNNING WATER. He looks at himself
          in the mirror.
                         
          She UNPACKS her suitcases on her bed. He rejoins her.

          She takes out some CARDS.
                         
           ROSA'S MOTHER (CONT'D)
           I already had some announcement
           cards. I've seen a lot of death. I
           think of everything. I'll prepare
           her a beautiful room with flowers.
           20.
                         
                         
                          PAUL
           The cards, clothes, relatives,
           flowers. You've got everything in
           that suitcase. You didn't forget
           anything. But I don't want any
           priests here.
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           But...
                         
                          PAUL
           No priests.
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           But Paul...
                         
                          PAUL
           Understand?
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           We have to. Funerals must be
           religious.
                         
          Paul EXPLODES -- She jumps a foot back.
                         
                          PAUL
           No!!!
                         
          He DARES HER with his eyes, ENRAGED.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Rosa didn't believe! Nobody
           believes in the fucking God here!
                         
          He throws her suitcase AGAINST THE WALL.
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           Paul, don't shout. Don't talk like
           that.
                         
          He SNATCHES THE PAPER from her hands.
                         
                          PAUL
           The priest doesn't want any
           suicides. The Church doesn't want
           any suicides, do they?
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           They'll give her absolution.
                         
          He RAISES HIS HAND threatening to HIT HER.
                         
                          PAUL
           Heh!?

          Scared, she pushes on.
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           Absolution and a nice mass. That's
           all I ask, Paul. Rosa... Rosa is my
           little girl, do you understand?
           Rosa... Why did she kill herself?
                         
          She starts WEEPING.
                         
                          PAUL
           Why? Why did she commit suicide?
           Why?
                         
          He PUMMELS THE DOOR with his fists ... ENRAGED...
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           You don't know? You don't know.
                         
          He closes her DOOR.

          Some of the OTHER GUESTS pop their heads out to see what the
          COMMOTION IS. He gently CLOSES THEIR DOORS in a "mind your
          own business" sort of way.
                         
          There is always the "Miss know it all, busybody type" though.
                         
          She sheepishly REOPENS HER DOOR.
                         
          Paul walks calmly back to it and SLAMS IT in her face ---
          IRATE.

          Jeanne enters the ALREADY OPEN DOOR. She looks around the

          LIVING ROOM -
                         
          Paul has decided his BED FITS BETTER in here. The BOTTOM
          MATTRESS is on the floor in the MIDDLE OF THE ROOM. He LEANS
          AGAINST THE WALL and top mattress, WAITING FOR JEANNE. He
          knew she'd be there.
                         
          She TAKES A SEAT on the bottom mattress and takes off her
          boots.
                         
          He watches her and does the same with his shoes. KICKING THEM
          OFF and CATCHING THEM in the air PLAYFULLY.

           look at each other.
                         
                          JEANNE
           It's beautiful without knowing
           anything.
                         
          They REGARD each other for seconds.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Maybe... Maybe we can come without
           touching.
                         
                          PAUL
           Come without touching? OK.
                         
          He leans his head back and CLOSES his eyes... SCREWING UP HIS
          FACE. She COPIES HIM.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Are you concentrating? Did you come
           yet?
                         
                         
                          JEANNE
           No. It's difficult!
                          PAUL
           I didn't either yet. You're not
           trying hard enough.
                         
          They STOP THE SILLINESS. They laugh. She wraps her arms
          around his neck.
                         
                          JEANNE
           I shall have to invent a name for
           you.
                         
                          PAUL
           A name? Oh, Jesus Christ! Oh, God,
           I've been called by a million names
           all my life. I don't want a name.
           I'm better off with a grunt or a
           groan for a name. Do you wanna hear
           my name?
           23.
                         
                         
          Paul does some PLAYFUL ANIMAL SOUNDS. APE SOUNDING GRUNTS and
          such. He contorts his face and LOOKS SILLY.
                         
                          JEANNE
           It's so masculine.
                         
                          PAUL
           Yeah.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Listen to mine.
                         
          She mimics his idea and makes her own PLAYFUL ANIMAL SOUNDS.
          He laughs.
                         
                          PAUL
           I didn't get the last name.
                         
          She redoes the SOUNDS for him. He JOINS her. Their ANIMAL
          SOUNDS BLEED INTO...

          FINALLY, Jeanne opens the gate door, sheepishly. She is LATE

           It's not a wig, it's my hair.
                         
          She CLOSES THE GATE.

          INT. JEANNE'S FAMILY COUNTRY MANOR
                         
          Jeanne holds up a PICTURE. She points to people as she
          describes them.
                         
                          JEANNE
           That's me there. And that's
           Mademoiselle Sauvage, the teacher.
           She was very strict... and very
           religious.
                         
          Olympia CHIMES IN AGAIN from behind the CAMERA CREW.
           26.
                         
                         
                          OLYMPIA
           She was too good. She spoilt you.
                         
          The Camera Crew turns the camera on her. Jeanne has a
          DIFFERENT PICTURE, pointing again.
                         
                          JEANNE
           That's Christine...
                         
          They turn back to Jeanne.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           ...my best friend. She married the
           pharmacist and has two children.
           It's like a village here. We all
           know each other.
                         
          Olympia chimes in again from behind, in an open door.
                         
                          OLYMPIA
           I couldn't live in Paris.
                         
          The camera turns on her, then back to Jeanne.
                         
                          JEANNE
           We're safe here. It's odd looking
           at the past.
                         
                          TOM
           Cut!
                         
          He walks to her.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           Why is it odd? It's you! It's
           fantastic, it's your childhood.
           It's everything I was looking for.
                         
          He turns on his camera crew who is UNDER HIS HEELS, shewing
          them out.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           What are you up to? Move it! Move
           it!
           (to the lead crewman)
           Who are these zombies who are
           always following you around?
           (to all of them)
           Scoot! Go on! The door, the door...
                         
          He starts opening all the doors in the MANOR.
           27.
                         
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           I'm opening the door. I'm opening
           all the doors.
                         
                         
                          JEANNE
           What are you doing?
                         
                          TOM
           Setting up my shot. There it is!
           That's it! I've found it. Reverse
           gear!
                         
          Olympia is loitering in one of the rooms he comes in. Imagine
          her nerve, in her own house!
                         
          Tom is the typical RUDE FRENCH DIVA DIRECTOR.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           What are you doing there? Beat it!
                         
          He turns his attention back to Jeanne, the subject of his
          OBSESSION.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           That's it. Into reverse. Yes! Do
           you see? Like a car, you go into
           reverse gear. That's it. Close your
           eyes.
                         
          She closes her eyes. He guides her BACKWARDS by the shoulders
          through the MANOR.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           Start reversing. Close your eyes.
           That's it, come on. Come on
           backwards. That's it. Go back to
           your childhood.
                         
          Jeanne BACKS TO a ROW OF PICTURES. She touches each and
          recalls the subject.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Papa?

          He starts a COUNTDOWN of ages, as if he is HYPNOTIZING HER.

          Jeanne backs into a DESK.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           We're there.
                         
          Jeanne kneels down in front of the desk.
                         
                          JEANNE

          She crawls under A TABLE. She finds a NOTEBOOK in a SECRET
          HIDING SPOT.

           He played the piano divinely.
           That's how I remember him...

           He played for hours and hours. At
           the bottom of the garden, there
           were two big trees. A plane tree
           and a chestnut tree. After mass on
           Sundays, we used to sit there, each
           under our own tree. It was
           wonderful. We sat gazing into each
           other's eyes.

           Aren't my trees beautiful? They
           were my jungle.
                         
          They come upon the CROWD OF KIDS again. One KID is squatting
          behind some thatch, doing his business.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)

           Having a shit.
                         
          The boy pooping stops and PULLS UP HIS PANTS.
                         
                          KID 2
           No, we're doing a poo.
                         
          Jeanne SCOLDS THEM.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Shame on you, doing it in my

           Run for it!
                         
          They SCATTER towards the STONE WALL with Olympia and Crew
          CHASING AFTER THEM.
                         
                          OLYMPIA
           Oh, these dirty little Arabs! Go

          Tom wanders back over to Jeanne while Olympia and the Crew
          continue to SCARE OFF THE KIDS in the b.g..

           Olympia was great. It'll give a
           good idea of race relations in the
           suburbs of Paris.
                         
                          TOM
           It's a real jungle here. So, tell

           But the colonel... the colonel!

          She continues to WAX NOSTALGIC about her father.

                          JEANNE
           What?
                         
          Pissed, she THROWS THE PILLOW she was covering her AMPLE
          BREAST with at Paul.
                         
          We now see Paul is LOUNGING ON HIS MATTRESS, pant legs rolled
          up past his knees, TOYING WITH A HARMONICA and drinking from
          a WOODEN CUP.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           What? Don't...
                         
                          PAUL
           All uniforms are bullshit.
           Everything outside this place is
           bullshit. Besides, I don't want to
           hear about your stories, about your
           past, and all that.
                         
                          JEANNE
           He died in Algeria in 58...
                         
                          PAUL
           Or 68 or 28 or 98...
                         
                          JEANNE
           58, and don't joke about things
           like that.
                         
                          PAUL
           Listen, why don't you stop talking
           about things that don't matter
           here? What the hell's the
           difference?
                         
          DIALOGUE SWITCHES TO ENGLISH
                         
                          JEANNE
           OK.
                         
          She huffs over to the other SIDE OF THE ROOM, crossing her
          arms, POUTING.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           So what do I have to say? What do I
           have to do!?
                         
          He turns on to his back to evince his CROTCH.
           33.
                         
                         
                          PAUL
           Come on the good ship...
                          (SINGS)
           Lollipop...
                         
          He PLAYS A TUNE on his harmonica. She sneaks onto the bed IN
          THE SHADOWS.
                         
                          JEANNE'S VOICE
           Why don't you go back in America?
                         
          He stops PLAYING THE TUNE.
                         
                          PAUL
           I don't know. Bad memories, I
           guess.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Of what?
                         
                          PAUL
           Oh... My father was a... a drunk.
           Tough. Whore-fucker, bar-fighter.
           Super-masculine. And he was tough.
           My mother was very... Very poetic.
           And also a drunk. And... one of my
           memories, when I was a kid, was of
           her being arrested nude. We lived
           in this small town. Farming
           community. We lived on a farm.
           And I'd come home after school and
           she'd be gone. In jail... or
           something. And... I used to... I
           used to have to milk a cow every
           morning and every night and I liked
           that. I remember...
                         
          An IRISH COUNTRY JIG plays over the MONOLOGUE.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           One time I was all dressed up to go
           out and take this girl to a
           basketball game. And I started to
           go out and my father said, "You
           have to milk the cow." I said,
           "Would you please milk it for me?"
           And he said, "No, get your ass out
           there." So I went out and I was in
           a hurry and didn't have time to
           change my shoes. And I had cow shit
           all over my shoes. And on the way
           to the basketball game, it smelled
           in the car. I don't know. I-I can't
           remember very many good things.
           34.
                         
                         
                          JEANNE'S VOICE
           Not one?
                         
                          PAUL
           Yeah. Some. There was a farmer, a
           very nice guy. Old guy, very poor,
           and worked real hard. I used to
           work in a ditch, draining land for
           farming. And he wore overalls and
           he smoked a clay pipe. Half the
           time he wouldn't put tobacco in it.
           And I hated the work. It was hot
           and dirty and... it broke my back.
           And... all day long I'd watch his
           spit which would run down the pipe
           stem and hang on the bowl of the
           pipe. And I used to make bets with
           myself on when it was going to fall
           off. And I always lost. I never saw
           it fall off. I'd just look around
           and it'd be gone and then the new
           one would be there. And then we had
           a beautiful... My mother... My
           mother taught me to love nature.
           And... I guess that was the most
           she could do. And... we had... In
           front of our house we had this big
           field... meadow. It was a mustard
           field in the summer and we had a
           big black dog named Dutchy. And she
           used to hunt for rabbits in that
           field but she couldn't see them. So
           she'd have to leap up in this
           mustard field and look around very
           quickly to see where the rabbits
           were. And it was... very beautiful.
           And she never caught the rabbits.
                         
          Jeanne looks up from the bed, MISCHIEVOUSLY.
                         
                          JEANNE
           You have been had!
                         
                          PAUL
           Oh really?
                         
                          JEANNE
           I don't wanna know anything about
           your past, baby!
                         
                          PAUL
           You think I was telling you the
           truth?
           35.
                         
                         
          Jeanne flaps her arms. Paul TWILLS his eyebrows in response.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Maybe... Maybe...
                         
          Jeanne climbs on the bed with the top sheet like a LIONESS
          STALKING her prey.
                         
                          JEANNE
           I'm a Red Riding Hood and you're
           the wolf.
                         
          She COVERS HIM UP with the sheet. Then she uncovers his arm.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           What strong arms you have!
                         
          She SNIFFS HIS ARM. Paul PLAYS ALONG.
                         
                          PAUL
           The better to squeeze a fart out of
           you!
                         
          She plays with his hands.
                         
                          JEANNE
           What long nails you have!
                         
                          PAUL
           The better to scratch your ass
           with.
                         
          She REACHES UNDER the sleeve of his shirt to his chest.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Oh, what a lot of fur you have!
                         
                          PAUL
           The better to let your crabs hide
           in.
                         
          She lifts the sheet from his face, moves his harmonica and
          looks in his mouth.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Ooh, what a long tongue you have!
                         
          He TALKS FUNNY as Jeanne holds on to his tounge.
                         
                          PAUL
           The better to... to stick in your
           rear, my dear.
           36.
                         
                         
          She makes her way down to his CROTCH, uncovering the sheet as
          she goes. She REGARDS HIS PRIVATE AREA.
                         
                          JEANNE
           What's this for?
                         
                          PAUL
           That's your happiness and my... my
           ha-penis.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Peanuts?
                         
          Jeanne SMILES ON as Paul reels off a list of FOREIGN NAMES
          for the MALE GENITALIA.
                         
                          PAUL
           Schlong. Wienerwurst. Cazzo. Bitte.
           Prick! Joint!
                         
          Jeanne gets a kick out of this... Sort of.
                         
                          JEANNE
           It's funny. It's like playing grown-
           ups when you're little. I feel like
           a child again here.
                         
                          PAUL
           Did you have fun as a kid?
                         
                          JEANNE
           It's the most beautiful thing.
                         
                          PAUL
           It's beautiful to be made into a
           tattletale or forced to admire
           authority or sell yourself for a
           piece of candy.
                         
                          JEANNE
           I wasn't like that.
                         
                          PAUL
           No?
                         
                          JEANNE
           I was writing poems. I was drawing
           castles,... big castles with tower.
           A lot of tower.
                         
                          PAUL
           Did you ever think about sex?
           37.
                         
                         
                          JEANNE
           No. No sex.
                         
          Paul MOCKS HER.
                         
                          PAUL

           Tower.
                         
          He gives her a LOVE SMACK on the head.
                         
                          PAUL
           You were probably in love with your
           teacher.
                         
                          JEANNE
           My teacher was a woman.
                         
                          PAUL
           And she was a lesbian.
                         
                          JEANNE
           How did you know?
                         
                          PAUL
           That's classical... Anyway...
                         
                          JEANNE
           My first love was my cousin Paul.
                         
          Paul explodes.
                         
                          PAUL
           No! I'm gonna get a hemorrhoid
           if you keep telling me names. No
           names. I don't mind if you tell
           the truth, but don't give me the
           names.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Sorry. Sorry.
                         
                          PAUL
           Well, go on. Tell the truth. What
           else?
                         
                          JEANNE
           I was ... He was dark, very thin. I
           can see him. Big nose! A big
           romance. I fell in love with him
           when I heard him playing piano.
           38.
                         
                         
                          PAUL
           You mean when he first got into
           your knickers.
                         
                          JEANNE
           He was a child prodigy. He was
           playing with both hands.
                         
                          PAUL
           I'll bet he was... Probably getting
           his kicks.
                         
                          JEANNE
           We were dying of heat.
                         
                          PAUL
           Oh, yeah. Good excuse. What else?
                         
                          JEANNE
           In the afternoon, when the grown-
           ups were napping...
                         
                          PAUL
           You started grabbing his joint.
                         
                          JEANNE
           You're crazy!
                         
                          PAUL
           Well, he touched you.
                         
                          JEANNE
           I never let him! Never!
                         
                          PAUL
           Ohhhh. Liar, liar, pants on fire,
           nose as long as a telephone wire.
                         
                          JEANNE
           No, I'm not.
                         
                          PAUL
           Look me straight in the face and
           say, "He didn't touch me once."
           Huh?
                         
          She SMILES.
                         
                          JEANNE
           He touched me, but the way he did
           it.
           39.
                         
                         
                          PAUL
           Aha! The way he did it. OK, what
           did he do?
                         
                          JEANNE
           Behind the house, there were two
           trees. A plane tree and a chestnut.
           I sat under the plane tree and he
           sat under the chestnut. And one,
           two, three... We each began to
           masturbate. The first who came...
           won!
                         
          Paul is suddenly LOST IN HIS THOUGHTS. He wanders to the
          wall, leans on it and studies his harmonica.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Why aren't you listening to me?
                         
                          PAUL
           When did you first come? How old
           were you?
                         
                          JEANNE
           The first time? I was really late
           for school. I started running and
           it was downhill. All of a sudden,
           I felt a strong sensation here.
           So I ran and ran and I came as I
           ran. The faster I ran, the better
           it was and the more I came. A
           couple of days later, I tried to do
           it again, but no luck.
                         
          Paul climbs a TRIPOD that is leaning against the wall.
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Why aren't you listening to me?
                         
          He takes the PIN OUT and it comes apart. He FALLS BACK.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Why do I feel like I'm talking to a
           brick wall when I talk to you? Your
           solitude weighs on me. It isn't
           indulgent. It isn't generous. You
           are selfish!
                         
          He finally looks at her.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           I can be by myself, too, you know!
                         
          DRUM MUSIC STARTS AS...
           40.
                         
                         
          He smiles, twirls a drum stick, puts his harmonica on her
          head and goes into the NEXT ROOM.
                         
          She THROWS THE HARMONICA on the floor in disgust.
                         
          As he FIDDLE FARTS around the apartment, Jeanne MASTURBATES.
                         
                         DINING ROOM
                         
          Paul is REUNITED with his SMALL LAMP SHADE. He puts it over
          his face and CRIES into it.
                         
                         LIVING ROOM
                         
          Jeanne has CUM. She ROLLS OFF THE MATTRESSES onto the floor,
          SPENT.
                         
          She ROCKS BACK AND FORTH on her haunches.
                         
          A SIREN screams outside. She hugs the wall.
                         
                         DINING ROOM
                         
          Paul is LOST IN GRIEF, crying harder.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. HOTEL - LOBBY
                         
          SAX MUSIC PLAYS - from a room in the HOTEL.
                         
          It's soothing and nice. Nevertheless, Rosa's mother roams the
          room, sleepless, a CROCHET BLANKET wrapped around her. Paul
          sleeps on the couch. She covers him with a the blanket,
          MATERNAL.
                         
          He THROWS IT on the floor.
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           I can't sleep with this music.
                         
                          PAUL
           I came to this hotel a long time
           ago, to spend one night. And I
           stayed for five years.
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           When Papa and I had the hotel,
           people came here to sleep.
                         
                          PAUL
           Now, there's all sorts. They can
           hide, take drugs, play music.
           41.
                         
                         
          Rosa's mother reaches out and strokes Paul's arm.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Take your hand away.
                         
          She continues stroking.
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           You're not alone, Paul. I'm here.
                         
          He sits up calmly, taking her hand in his own, then... BITES
          HER!!!
                         
          She PULLS HER HAND BACK in obvious pain.
                         
           ROSA'S MOTHER (CONT'D)
           You're crazy! I'm starting to
           understand.
                         
                          PAUL
           Do you want me to make them shut
           up? OK. I'll make them shut up.
                         
          Paul gets up and TURNS OFF THE MASTER LIGHT SWITCH. Rosa's
          mother STANDS, SCARED.
                         
                         
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           What are you doing, Paul? I'm
           afraid!
                         
          Paul STALKS TOWARD her in the DARK.
                         
                          PAUL
           What's the matter, Mother? Are you
           upset? Don't be. There's nothing to
           be upset about. It takes so little
           to make them afraid. I'll tell you
           what they're afraid of.
                         
          He leads her by the ARM to the stairs.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           They're afraid of the dark. Imagine
           that! Come on, Mother. Meet my
           friends.
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           Put the light on!
                         
          They look up the stairs to all the GUESTS that are out of
          their rooms.
           42.
                         
                         
                          PAUL
           You should meet a few clients of
           the hotel. Hey, folks. I'd like you
           to say hello to Mom. Mom, this is
           Mr Juicehead Junky here. And... Mr
           Saxophone, he's... He's our
           connection, Mom. He gives us some
           hard stuff once in a while. And
           right here is the beautiful Miss
           Blowjob of 1933. She still makes a
           few points when she takes her teeth
           out.
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           The light, Paul.
                         
                          PAUL
           Say hello, Mom! This is Mom! Oh!
           You afraid of the dark, Mom? She's
           afraid of the dark. Oh, poor thing.
           All right, sweetheart. I'll take
           care of you. I'll give you a little
           light. I'll give you a little
           light. Don't you worry about a
           thing.
                         
                         
          Paul turns the lights back on. The GUESTS who are gathered on
          the stairs, scurry back to their rooms.
                         
                         HOTEL ENTRANCE
                         
          Rosa's Mother stares on as the COMMOTION CLEARS. A GUEST
          comes in the front door carrying NEWSPAPERS. This is MARCEL,
          (60's) Rosa's LOVER.
          He takes off his hat for her.
                         
                          MARCEL
           Good evening, madame.
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           Good evening.
                         
          Paul saunters into the room. He surveys the IRONIC SCENE.
                         
                          PAUL
           Good evening, Marcel.
                         
          Marcel picks up on the awkward energy. He heads up the stairs
          to his room. Paul hands him a key on the way up.
                         
                          MARCEL
           Goodnight, Paul.
           43.
                         
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           Who's that?
                         
                          PAUL
           Do you like him? He was Rosa's
           lover.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. APT. BUILDING - BATHROOM - MORNING
                         
          Jeanne, NAKED, roots through Paul's coat pockets. She finds
          his RAZOR, but scoots to the sink when she HEARS HIM COMING.
          She starts applying makeup and SINGING.
                         
          Paul enters the bathroom. He takes his SHAVING ACCOUTREMENTS
          (razor, strop, brush, etc.) out of his coat pockets. Jeanne
          watches him intently in the MIRROR.
                         
          He joins her at the LARGE BASIN SINK. She pretends to have
          been putting on her make-up all along. She RESUMES HER SONG.
                         
                          JEANNE
           What am I doing in this apartment
           with you? Love?
                         
          Paul starts putting his SHAVING CREAM on with a shaving
          brush.
                         
                          PAUL
           Well... Let's say we're just taking
           a flying... a flying fuck at a
           rolling doughnut.
                          JEANNE
           So you think I'm a wore.
                         
          He MOCKS her obvious mispronunciation of "whore".
                         
                          PAUL
           I think you're a what? A what? A
           wore?
                         
                          JEANNE
           A wore.
                         
                          PAUL
           You mean whore.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Yes, a whore. Whore.
           44.
                         
                         
                          PAUL
           No, you're just a good old
           fashioned girl... trying to get
           along.
                         
                          JEANNE
           I prefer to be a whore.
                         
          She applies more makeup.
                         
                          PAUL
           Why were you going through my
           pockets?
                         
                          JEANNE
           To find out OOH you are.
                         
          He MOCKS her mispronunciation of "who" this time.
                         
                          PAUL
           To find out OOH you are.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Yes.
                         
                          PAUL
           Well, if you look real close,
           you'll see me hiding behind my
           zipper.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Well, we know that he buys clothes
           in some big store. That's not much.
           But it's a beginning.
                          PAUL
           That's not a beginning, that's a
           finish.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Well, OK. Let's forget it. How old
           are you?
                         
                          PAUL
           I'll be 93 this weekend.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Oh, you don't look it.
                         
                          PAUL
           Thank you.
                         
          She LAUGHS.
           45.

           Have you been in college?
                         
                          PAUL
           Oh yeah. Yeah. I went to... the
           University of Congo. Studied whale-
           fucking.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Wow!
                         
          He SHARPENS his razor on the STROP.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Barbers don't usually go to
           university.
                         
                          PAUL
           Are you telling me that I look like
           a barber?
                         
                          JEANNE
           No, but that's a razor's barber.
                         
          He CORRECTS her again.
                         
                          PAUL
           That's a barber's razor.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Barber's razors, yes.
                         
                          PAUL
           Or a madmans.
          He starts SHAVING his neck with the STRAIGHT RAZOR.
                         
                          JEANNE
           So you want to cut me up?
                         
                          PAUL
           No. That would be like writing my
           name on your face.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Like they do to slaves?
                         
                          PAUL
           Slaves are branded on the ass and I
           want you free.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Free?! I'm not free! You want to
           know why...

                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           why you don't want to know anything
           about me? Because you hate women.
                         
                          PAUL
           Oh, really?
                         
                          JEANNE
           What the hell have they ever done
           to you?
                         
                          PAUL
           Well,... either they always pretend
           to know who I am or they pretend I
           don't know who they are and that's
           very boring.
                         
                          JEANNE
           I'm not afraid to say who I am. I
           am 20 years old...
                         
          Paul EXPLODES.
                         
                          PAUL
           NO! I... Jesus Christ! Where is
           your brain? State zitta. Halt's
           Maul, Schweinehund. Shut up. Get
           it?
                         
          She stands, POUTING.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           I know it's tough but you're gonna
           have to bear it.
                         
          She hits the sink and TURNS to us, we see her AMPLE BUSH. She
          crosses her arms and continues to POUT like a child.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           You know, these sinks are really
           beautiful. They're very rare, you
           don't find them any more. I think
           it's these sinks that let you stay
           together.
                         
          He has finished SHAVING.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Hmm? Don't you think?
                         
          He FINALLY NOTICES her pouting.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           What's that? What's all this?
           47.

           Mad?
                         
          He throws her over his shoulder. He SPINS HER AROUND. She
          screams but goes with it.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Mad? Mad? Mad?
                         
          She LOVES IT. He puts her down on the sink. She is LAUGHING.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           I think I'm happy with you.
                         
          He leaves the bathroom. She slaps the sink top, CHILDLIKE.

          from the BATHROOM.

          She comes around the corner...
                         
                          JEANNE
           Shall we leave together?
                         
          ... Just in time for Paul to SLAM THE DOOR IN HER FACE.

          A train enters the station. Tom gets off. He searches for
          Jeanne.
           48.
                         
                         
          When the Train leaves, we see her sitting on a bench on the
          adjacent track.
                         
          She notices him first.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Tom!
                         
                          TOM
           Jeanne! What are you doing there?
           I'm coming! I'll fly!
                         
          He starts RUNNING TO THE EXIT.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Wait! I've got to talk to you.
                         
                          TOM
           Why didn't you speak on the phone?
           What's up?
                         
                          JEANNE
           You must find someone else.
                         
                          TOM
           For what?
                         
                          JEANNE
           For your film.
                         
                          TOM
           Why.
                         
          He FRAMES HER with his fingers.
                          JEANNE
           Because you're taking advantage of
           me! Because you make me do things
           I've never done! Because you're
           taking up my time! You make me do
           whatever you want! The film is
           over!
                         
          A train ROARS into the station between them. Jeanne is
          ANNOYED.

          The train is gone, but there is no one there... Tom is GONE.
                         
          Jeanne walks toward the EXIT. Tom appears on HER SIDE of the
          platform.
           49.
                         
                         
          They STALK EACH other like ANIMALS. He SLAPS HER HARD in the
          head. She SLAPS him back.
                         
          They FIGHT until she collapses from exhaustion in his arms.

           You wanted to talk to me. Go on,

           Yes, yes, yes.
                         
          Paul takes a look at one of the newspapers from Marcel's

           Your meticulous. I've always
           wondered why you save newspaper
           clippings. Is it work? Or a hobby?
                         
                          MARCEL
           Hobby? I don't like that word.
           Let's say it's some extra cash.
           I do it for an agency.
                         
                          PAUL
           Oh, so it's serious. It's a job
           that makes you read? Very
           educational.

           Be honest. You didn't know we had
           the same bathrobes.
                         
          Paul finds this VERY AMUSING.

          He flicks the light on and off as he talks.
           No, Rosa often talked to me about
           you. I don't think there are many
           marriages like that. It's
           strange... I'm thirsty.

           Hold on. Here's the bourbon.

          him. He pours a glass for Paul.
           51.
                         
                         
                          PAUL
           Was that a present from Rosa, too?
                         
          He POURS A GLASS for himself.
                         
                          MARCEL
           I don't really like bourbon, but
           Rosa wanted me to keep a bottle
           here in my room.
                         
          He SITS back down.
                         
                          MARCEL (CONT'D)
           I was asking myself this question.
           If, with these little things,
           unimportant things, we could go
           back over things, and understand
           together.
                         
                          PAUL
           Together?
                         
                          MARCEL
           It's almost a year that Rosa and
           I... Not passionately, but
           regularly... I thought I knew her
           as much as you can know...
                         
                          PAUL
           Your mistress...
                         
                          MARCEL
           For example, a while ago, something
           happened that I still don't
           understand. Do you see there, on
           the wall?
                         
          He points to a spot on the wall above them.
                         
                          MARCEL (CONT'D)
           She had climbed onto the bed and
           she was trying to tear at the walls
           with her hands. I stopped her
           because she was breaking her nails.
           She had a strange... violence about
           her. I'd never seen her like that.
                         
                          PAUL
           Our room is painted white. Rosa
           wanted it to be different from the
           other rooms in the hotel.
                         
          Marcel takes some LIPS SALVE from his bathrobe pocket.
           52.
                         
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           To make it look like... a more
           normal home. But... it had to be
           changed here, too. I think she
           started with the wall.
                         
          Paul takes notice of the LIP SALVE operation.
                         
                          MARCEL
           A cold sore. I don't know. Shit.
                         
          Paul regards him for a second.
                         
                          PAUL
           You're lucky huh? You were... You
           must have been very handsome 20
           years ago.
                         
                          MARCEL
           Not as much as you.
                         
                          PAUL
           You've still got all your hair.
                         
                          MARCEL
           My hair... I have to have it
           trimmed often. And wash it. I wash
           it nearly every day.
                         
                         
                          PAUL
           Don't you have massages?
                         
          He massages his own temples.
                          MARCEL
           Yes, I do.
                         
                          PAUL
           You're in good shape.
                         
          He paws at Marcel's stomach.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           What do you do for... your stomach?
           That's my problem.
                         
                          MARCEL
           For that...
                         
          He gazes across the room.
                         
                          MARCEL (CONT'D)
           I have a secret.
           53.
                         
                         
          He gets up and heads across the room.
                         
                          PAUL
           Tell me!
                         
          He takes a bar from the floor and slides it into a spot on
          the top of a DOOR FRAME.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Ah...
                         
                          MARCEL
           Are you leaving us? I saw your
           suitcase was packed. Ah... America.
           Why was she unfaithful to you?
                         
                          PAUL
           You can't believe that Rosa...
           killed herself. It's hard for me
           to... believe, too.
                         
          While Paul has a moment of REFLECTION, Marcel shows him his
          PULL-UP LEG KICK combo on his PULL-UP bar.
                         
                          MARCEL
           This is my secret! Thirty times
           every morning.
                         
          Paul leaves, DISGUSTED.
                         
                          PAUL
                          (ENGLISH)
           Really, Marcello, I wonder what she
           ever saw in you.
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. APT. BUILDING - DAY
                         
          Jeanne comes in carrying her FUR COLLARED COAT, purse and a
          BAG.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Are you in?
                         
          She looks around the place.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Is anyone here?
                         
          She kicks the door shut with her foot. She wanders to the...
                         
                         DINING ROOM
           54.
                         
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Hi, monster.
                         
          She throws her coat and purse on the table. She puts a
          PORTABLE RECORD PLAYER in the BASSINET.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Is something wrong?
                         
                         
          From the other room we hear Paul...
                         
                          PAUL'S VOICE
           There's butter in the kitchen.
                         
          We see that Paul is laying on the floor eating bread.
                         
                          JEANNE
           So you're here? Why didn't you
           answer?
                         
                          PAUL
           Go get the butter.
                         
                          JEANNE
           I have to hurry. I have a cab
           waiting.
                         
                          PAUL
           Go get the butter.
                         
          She STORMS into the kitchen. Paul continues eating.
                         
          She comes out and THROWS THE BUTTER on the floor in front of
          him.
                          JEANNE
           It makes me crazy!
                         
          She sits on the floor and opens a MIRRORED door on a cabinet.
          We see PAUL'S REFECTION IN IT.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           That you're so damned sure that I'm
           coming back here.
                         
          He laughs at her. She sits on her HAUNCHES, then her ass.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Do you really think that an
           American sitting on the floor in an
           empty flat eating cheese and
           drinking water is interesting?
           55.
                         
                         
          He NODS YES. She knocks on the FLOOR near her.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           There's something under here. Can
           you hear it? It's hollow. Can you
           hear it? It's hollow.
                         
                          PAUL
           Yeah. That's a hiding place.
                         
          He crawls toward her. We see Jeanne's reflection in a MIRROR
          behind him. He reaches toward the hollow spot. She SLAPS HIS
          HAND.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Don't open it!
                         
                          PAUL
           Why not?
                         
                          JEANNE
           I don't know. Don't open it.
                         
          He points to her CROTCH.
                         
                          PAUL
           What about that? Can I open that?
                         
          He reaches for it but she MOVES AWAY.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Huh? Wait a minute. Maybe there's
           jewels in it.
                         
          He starts to UNDO HER PANTS.
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Maybe there's gold.
                         
          He PULLS THE BUTTER OVER WITH HIS FOOT.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Are you afraid?
                         
                          JEANNE
           No.
                         
                          PAUL
           No?
                         
          He YANKS HER by the legs CLOSER TO HIM.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           You're always afraid.
           56.
                         
                         
          He FLIPS HER ON HER stomach, violently. She is not in the
          SAME GAME.
                         
                          JEANNE
           No, but... maybe there is some
           family secrets inside.
                         
                          PAUL
           Family secrets?
                         
          He RIPS HER PANTS DOWN TO HER ANKLES.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           I'll tell you about family secrets.
                         
          He gets a HAND FULL OF BUTTER.
                         
                          JEANNE
           What are you doing?
                         
                          PAUL
           I'm gonna tell you about the
           family.
                         
          He YANKS her pants down enough to put his HAND FULL OF BUTTER
          in her ASS.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           That holy institution meant to
           breed virtue in savages.
                         
          He SPREADS the butter in her ASS as she STRUGGLES.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           I want you to repeat it after me.
          He MOUNTS HER, opening his ZIPPER. She STRUGGLES more.
                         
                          JEANNE
           No and no! No!
                         
                          PAUL
           Repeat it. Say, "Holy family."
           Come on, say it.
                         
          He grabs her arms, stopping her from STRUGGLING as he
          SODOMIZES HER.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Go on. Holy family. Church of good
           citizens.
                         
          She is WEEPING.
           57.
                         
                         
                          JEANNE
           Church...
                         
                          PAUL
           Good citizens.

          She CRIES OUT in pain as he enters her.
                         
          He smacks her savagely on the back of her head.

          Jeanne puts a record on the RECORD PLAYER she brought with
          her. She goes to plug it into the FLOOR PLUG but gets an
          ELECTRICAL SHOCK.
                          JEANNE
           Shit!
                         
          She looks at him sleeping.

           That's good. I like surprises.
                         
          He FLIPS HIMSELF over backwards onto his feet. He walks over
          to her and the RECORD PLAYER. He stares down at her.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)

                          JEANNE
           Music. But I don't know how to work
           it.
                         
          He sits on the FLOOR next to her. He plugs in the RECORD
          PLAYER. He JUMPS as he gets an ELECTRICAL SHOCK. Jeanne is
          secretly amused.
                         
                          PAUL
           Do you enjoy that?

           to have a weapon.
                         
                          JEANNE
           You don't even know how to use it.

           The important thing is to have one.
           It makes an impression.
                         
                          JEANNE
           You really kept everything of
           Papa's.

           A strong race. I tried to employ
           them as servants, but it was
           disastrous. 'm glad I decided to
           send everything to the country. All
           his things were piling up and
           piling up.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Don't worry. You'll soon have all
           the space you want.

           Nothing.
                         
          She takes off the HAT and JACKET and throws them on the sofa.
          She heads to the FRONT DOOR with MOM FOLLOWING, on pins and

          They move into the center of the shop.
          We get another look at Jeanne's LEFT BREAST as it slips out
          of the dress being fitted.

                          TOM
           Yes.
                         
          Jeanne gives her upbeat EXTISTENTIAL RESPONSES as her fitting
          continues.
                         
                          JEANNE
           I see it everywhere. All the time.
           66.

           What do you mean, everywhere?
                         
                          JEANNE
           On walls. On buildings.
                         
                          TOM
           Walls and buildings?
                         
                          JEANNE
           Yes, on advertising hoardings.
                         
                          TOM
           What are they selling? Cars. Tinned
           meat. Cigarettes.
                         
                          JEANNE
           No. They're all about young
           couples. Before marriage, no
           children. Then the same couple,
           married with children. In short,
           marriage. The perfect, ideal,
           successful marriage. It's no longer
           the preserve of the Church. The
           husband was burdened with
           responsibilities and the wife
           nagged. Now, weddings in
           advertising smile!
                         
                          TOM
           They smile. On posters.
                         
                          JEANNE
           On posters, of course. But why t
           take poster marriage seriously?
           Marriage... Pop marriage!
                         
          Tom comes out from under a DRESS.
                         
                          TOM
           Pop? That's the formula. For pop
           youth, pop marriage! But... what if
           the pop marriage doesn't work?
                         
                          JEANNE
           Then you have to fix it like you
           would a car. The spouses are two
           workers in overalls bending over an
           engine to fix it.
                         
                          TOM
           And in case of adultery what
           happens to the pop marriage?
           67.
                         
                         
                          JEANNE
           In that case, there are three or
           four workers.
                         
                          TOM
           What about love? Is love pop?
                         
                          JEANNE
           No. That's not. Love isn't pop.
                         
                          TOM
           Love isn't pop. So what is it?
                         
                          JEANNE
           The workers retire to a secret
           flat, take off their overalls
           and become men and women again
           and make love.
                         
          The fussing on the dress is finished. Jeanne slowly, PUTS ON
          HER GLOVES, relishing them.
                         
          She STRUTS slowly for all to stare and LAVISH her in her
          dress.
                         
          Tom is CAPTIVATED.
                         
                          TOM
           You're wonderful.
                         
                          JEANNE
           It's the dress that makes the
           bride.

          Tom has lost Jeanne in all the HUBUB. He is disgusted with
          his CREW.

          He runs down the street in the rain looking for her.

          He opens the gate to the ELEVATOR and gets on. He pushes the
          button. The elevator STARTS UP.

          We see Jeanne has been waiting on the ADJACENT STAIRS for
          Paul. She is still in her WEDDING DRESS.

          Paul opens the curtains.
                         
          Jeanne's SCREAMS come from the other room. He goes to
          investigate.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           What the hell?
                         
          BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Jeanne screams BLOODY MURDER and points to a DEAD RAT on the
          STILL UNMADE MATTRESS.
           70.
                         
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           A rat. Only a rat.
                         
          He PICKS IT UP by the tail. She stumbles over herself to get
          away.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           There are more rats in Paris than
           people. Yum, yum, yum.
                         
          He holds it out, OFFERING IT to her. She freaks. She runs to
          the other side of the room.
                         
                          JEANNE
           I want to go!
                         
          He brings it to her... she continues to BACK PEDDLE.
                         
                          PAUL
           Wait, wait! Don't you want a bite
           first? You don't want to run and
           eat.
                         
                          JEANNE
           This is the end!
                         
          He points to the ASS of the RAT.
                         
                          PAUL
           No, this is the end...
                         
          Then points to the HEAD.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           ...but I like to start with the
           head. That's the best part. Are you
           sure you won't have any? OK.
                         
          He DANGLES IT over his mouth, flitting his tounge, pretending
          to eat it. She is gonna HURL.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           What's the matter? You don't dig
           rat?
                         
                          JEANNE
           I wanna go! I can't make love in
           this bed any more. I can't. It's
           disgusting! Nauseating!
                         
                          PAUL
           Well, we'll fuck on the radiator or
           standing on the mantel.
           71.
                         
                         
          He holds up the RAT again.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Listen, I gotta get some mayonnaise
           for this. Because, it really is
           good with mayonnaise.
                         
          He heads out, then stops and LOOKS BACK AT HER.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           I'll save the asshole for you.
                         
          He really leaves this time.
                         
                          PAUL'S VOICE
           Rat's asshole with mayonnaise!
                         
          He LAUGHS at himself.
                         
          Jeanne is a BASKET CASE. She sits on her HAUNCHES, muttering.
                         
                          JEANNE
           I want to get out of here. I want
           to go. I can't stand it here any
           more. Yes. I'm going.
                         
          She gets up, gets her purse and goes to the door. We see her
          ASS through the SHEER FABRIC of her wedding dress.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           I'm not coming back... ever.
                         
          She gets to the...
                         
                         FRONT DOOR
          Paul is there, WAITING, NONCHALANT.
                         
                          PAUL
           Quo vadis, baby?
                         
                          JEANNE
           I forgot to tell you something. I
           fell in love with somebody.
                         
                          PAUL
           Oh, isn't that wonderful? You know,
           you're going to have to get out of
           these wet duds.
                         
          He PATS HER ASS.
                         
                          JEANNE
           I'm going to make love with him!
           72.
                         
                         
          She opens the door but he closes it. She STOMPS into the
          HALL.
                         
                          PAUL
           Well, first you have to take a hot
           bath. Cos if you don't...
                         
          He walks toward her.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           ...you're gonna get pneumonia,
           right? Huh?
                         
          She STOMPS a few more steps toward the BATHROOM.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           And then you know what happens? You
           get pneumonia, then you know what
           happens? You die. And then, you
           know what happens when you die?
           I get to fuck the dead rat!
                         
          He THROWS HER OVER his shoulder and carries her KICKING AND
          SCREAMING into the...
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. BATHROOM
                         
          Jeanne is in the BATHTUB. Paul sits on the BIDET behind her
          with a WASHCLOTH.
                         
                          PAUL
           Give me the soap.
          She does.
                         
                          JEANNE
           I'm in love.
                         
                          PAUL
           You're in love?
                         
          He shoves her head UNDER THE WATER.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           How delightful.
                         
          She comes up ANGRY.
                         
                          JEANNE
           I'm in love! I'm in love, you
           understand?
           73.
                         
                         
          He SMACKS her with the washcloth on the head.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           I'm in love, I'm in love!
                         
          He SHOVES HER under again.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Oh! I'm in love!
                         
          He HITS HER on the head with her own shoe. She just gets more
          ANGRY.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           You know, you're old! You're
           getting fat.
                         
                          PAUL
           Fat, is it? How unkind.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Half of your hair is out and the
           other half is almost white.
                         
          He smacks her in the mouth with the wash cloth, she smiles.
                         
                          PAUL
           In ten years, you'll be playing
           soccer with your tits.
                         
          He starts WASHING HER back.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           What do you think of that? You know
           what I'm gonna be doing?
                          JEANNE
           You will be on a... wheelchair!
                         
                          PAUL
           Well, maybe. But, you know... I'll
           be smirking and giggling all the
           way to eternity.
                         
                          JEANNE
           How poetic. But please, before you
           go, wash my feet.
                         
          She holds up A FOOT.
                         
                          PAUL
           OK. oblesse oblige.
           74.
                         
                         
          He sits on the edge of the TUB and grabs her foot. He takes a
          sniff... She pulls it away.
                         
                          JEANNE
           You know, he and I, we make love.
                         
          He WASHES her foot.
                         
                          PAUL
           Oh, really? That's wonderful. Is he
           a good fucker?
                         
                          JEANNE
           Magnificent.
                         
          He puts up the OTHER FOOT to was, he obliges again.
                         
                          PAUL
           You know, you're a jerk. Cos the
           best fucking you're gonna get
           is right here in this apartment.
           Stand up.
                         
          She does. He washes her ASS.
                         
                          JEANNE
           He is full of mysteries.
                         
                          PAUL
           Give me the soap. Listen, you dumb
           dodo. All the mysteries that you're
           ever gonna know in life are right
           here.
                         
          He washes her STOMACH.
                          JEANNE
           He is like everybody but... at the
           same time he's different.
                         
                          PAUL
           You mean, like everybody.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Yeah, but... even he fright me.
           Even he frightens me.
                         
                          PAUL
           What is he, your local pimp?
                         
                          JEANNE
           He could be. He looks it. You know
           why I'm in love with him?
           75.
                         
                         
                          PAUL
           I can't wait.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Because he know. He know how to
           make me fall in love with him.
                         
          She gets out. He COVERS her with a BIG RED TOWEL.
                         
                          PAUL
           You want this man you love to
           protect and take care of you.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Yeah.
                         
                          PAUL
           You want this golden, shining,
           powerful warrior to build a
           fortress where you can hide in. So
           you don't have to ever... have...
           You don't ever have to be afraid.
           You don't have to feel lonely or
           empty. That's what you want, isn't
           it?
                         
                          JEANNE
           Yes.
                         
                          PAUL
           Well, you'll never find it.
                         
                          JEANNE
           But I find this man.
                          PAUL
           Then it won't be long until he'll
           want you to build a fortress for
           him out of your tits and out of
           your cunt and your hair and your
           smile and the way you smell. And...
           and some place where he can feel
           comfortable and secure enough so
           that he can worship in front of the
           altar of his own prick.
                         
                          JEANNE
           But I find this man!
                         
          They lean against SEPERATE WALLS.
           76.
                         
                         
                          PAUL
           No, you're alone. You're all alone.
           You won't be free of that feeling
           of being alone until you look death
           right in the face. I mean, that
           sounds like bullshit, some romantic
           crap, until you go right up into
           the ass of death. Right up in his
           ass... till you find the womb of
           fear. And then,... maybe... Maybe
           then, you'll be able to find him.

           But I find this man. He's you! You
           are that man!
                         
          Paul doesn't like that comment. He needs to TEACH HER another
          LESSON. He bites a HANGNAIL.
                         
                          PAUL
           Get me the scissors.

           Get me the fingernail scissors.
                         
          She STOMPS past him to get them, hands them to him.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           No. I want you to cut the
           fingernails on your right hand,
           these two.
          She DOES.

           and I'm... I'm gonna have the pig

           while you're fucking him. Then
           you'll have to go behind him. I
           want you to smell the dying farts

          ROSA'S WAKE. Rosa's mother has set up a room in the Hotel as
          a VIEWING ROOM for her daughter. She is, as promised,
          surrounded by TONS OF FLOWERS.
          Paul comes in and pulls up a chair next to ROSA. He turns on
          the LIGHT.

           You're your mother's masterpiece.
                         
          He pulls the chair closer to her.

          The cardboard box, I found all
          your... I found all your little
          goodies.
          Pens, keychains, foreign money,
          French ticklers, the whole shot.
          Even a clergyman's collar. I didn't
          know you collected all those little
          knick-knacks left behind. Even if
          the husband lives fucking years,
          he's never going to be able to
          discover his wife's real nature.
          I mean, I... I might be able to
          comprehend the universe, but... 'll
          never discover the truth bout you.
          Never. I mean, who the hell were
          you? Remember that day, the first
          day I was there? I knew that I
          couldn't get into your pants unless
          I said... What did I say? Oh, yeah.
          "May I have my bill, please? I have
          to leave." Remember? Last night...
          I ripped off the lights on your
          mother. And the whole joint went
          bananas. All your... guests... as
          you used to call them... Well, I
          guess that includes me, doesn't it?
          It does include me, doesn't it? For
          five years, I was more a guest in
          this fucking flophouse than a
          husband. With privileges, of
          course. And then, to help me
          understand you, you let me inherit
          Marcel. The husband's double, whose
          room was the double of ours. And
          you know what? I didn't even have
          the guts to ask him. Didn't have
          the guts to ask him if the same
          numbers you and I did were the same
          numbers you did with him. Our
          marriage was nothing more than a
          foxhole for you. And all it took
          for you to get out was a -cent
          razor and a tub full of water. You
          cheap, goddamn, fucking,
          godforsaken whore. I hope you rot
          in hell. You're worse than the
          dirtiest street pig anybody could
          find, and you know why? You know
          why? Because you lied. You lied to
          me and I trusted you. You lied. You
          knew you were lying! Go on, tell me
          you didn't lie. Haven't you got
          anything to say about that? You can
          think up something, can't you?

           That's not true. When you're full,
           you put a sign outside. I know the
           hotel. I'm sick of arguing out on

           are you waiting for? The owner has

          We see that the mattress is gone. Only a pile of sheets and
          pillows remain in the room.
                         
          Jeanne is on the floor, on her knees, doubled over in SICK
          GRIEF. PAUL HAS MOVED OUT.
                         
                          JEANNE
           No!
                         
          She WANDERS through the apt., GRIEF STRICKEN, from room to
          room. We see only a FEW BELONGINGS left around. Shoes, the
          CAT (where was it for the "rat problem"?) and phone.
          DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Jeanne RIPS THE SHEET OFF the piece of furniture that has
          been COVERED UP all along. We all wondered what was
          underneath that was so precious.
                         
          It's nothing special. She COLLAPSES in grief again, the
          furniture falling on her, she KICKS IT OFF.

          Jeanne talks to the CRAZY Concierge from BEFORE. Her head
          STUCK through the LITTLE WINDOW while the crazy woman PUFFS a
          cig.

                          JEANNE
           Try and remember! The man from the
           fourth floor. He moved in a few
           days ago.

           I told you, I don't know anyone.
           They come and go. The man on the
           fourth, the woman on the first.
           What do I know?
                         
          She gives a CRAZY CACKLE.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Where did they take the furniture
           too? It's empty. Where do you send
           his mail? Give me his address.
                         
                          CONCIERGE
           I don't have it. I don't know these
           people.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Not even his name?
                         
                          CONCIERGE
           Nothing!
                         
          Jeanne STORMS OUT.

          Jeanne is on the payphone in the bar from before. She speaks
          to Tom. Still DESPONDENT, tears stream down her face.
                         
                          JEANNE
           I've found a flat for us. 1 rue
           Jules Verne. Yes. In Passy. Come
           quickly! You'll come now? Do you
           know where it is? I'll wait for
           you. Come over.
                         
                         
          She struggles to HANG UP THE PHONE through her grief. She
          BREAKS DOWN, closing the door for privacy.

          We can SEE HER through the door as she leans on it.

           Come in, it's open.
                         
          Tom comes in. Jeanne stares out the window. She is BATHED in
          sunlight.
                         
          Tom LOOKS AROUND in b.g.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Do you like our flat? It's very
           light. There's a tiny room, too.
           It's too small for a double bed. It
           would be fine for a child. Fidel.
           That's a nice name for a boy.
           Fidel, as in Castro.
                         
                         
                          TOM
           But I'd like a girl, too. Rosa. As
           in Rosa Luxemburg. Less famous, but
           I like it. You know, I wanted to
           film you every day. In the morning,
           when you wake up, in the evening,
           when you sleep. When you first
           smile, and I didn't film any of
           that. Here.
          He hands her FLOWERS. She REGARDS them.
                         
          He circles to her front.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           Today is the last day of shooting.
           The film is finished. I don't like
           things that finish, things that
           end. You have to start something
           else right away.
                         
          They EMBRACE and KISS.

          Tom looks around the place.

           This flat is huge!
                         
          Jeanne has made her way to the DINING ROOM.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           Where are you?
                         
                          JEANNE
           I'm here!
                         
          They continue shouting across the apt.
                         
                          TOM
           It's too big! We'll get lost!
                         
                          JEANNE
           Stop it! Don't start!
                         
                          TOM
           How did you find this flat?
                         
                          JEANNE
           By chance.
                         
                          TOM
           We'll change everything!
                         
          Jeanne holds her ARMS OUT like a bird.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Everything! We'll change chance to
           destiny.
                         
                          TOM
           Go on, Jeanne. Take off!
                         
          MUSIC RISES as Jeanne pretends to FLY AROUND the apt. from
          ROOM TO ROOM making AIRPLANE NOISES as Tom DIRECTS HER.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           Fly away, you're in heaven! You're
           soaring, you're in heaven! Come
           down, take a nose dive, come down!
           Make three turns, come down.
           Jeanne, what's happening? There's
           an air pocket.
                         
          Tom gets SUDDENLY SERIOUS.
                         
                          JEANNE
           What's happening?
           86.
                         
                         
                          TOM
           The patches of turbulence are over.
           We can't play like children any
           more, Jeanne.
                         
          This stops Jeanne in her TRACKS.
                         
          They face each other.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           We're adults.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Adults? That's awful!
                         
                          TOM
           Yes. It's awful.
                         
                          JEANNE
           What do adults do?
                         
                          TOM
           I don't know. We'll have to invent
           the gestures and the words. For
           example, adults...
                         
          He walks slowly toward her. They EMBRACE PASSIONATELY. They
          kiss.
                         
          He breaks away again, SERIOUS.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           But there's one thing I do know.
           Adults are calm...
          He walks backward as Jeanne STALKS HIM.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           ...serious, logical, measured,
           level-headed...
                         
                          JEANNE
           Yes...
                         
                          TOM
           And... they face up to problems...
                         
                          JEANNE
           ...Yes, yes. Yes, yes.
                         
          He STOPS ABRUPTLY.
           87.
                         
                         
                          TOM
           You see, Jeanne, this flat won't
           work for us. This flat, it won't
           work for us, Jeanne.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Where are you going?
                         
                          TOM
           To look for a flat.
                         
          He walks out to a SHOCKED Jeanne.
                         
                          JEANNE
           What kind of flat?
                         
          But he COMES BACK.
                         
                          TOM
           A flat we can live in.
                         
                          JEANNE
           We can live here.
                         
                          TOM
           It's squalid. It smells. It makes
           me sick. Are you coming with me?
                         
                          JEANNE
           No, no. I've got to close the
           windows and return the key. There's
           a lot to do.
                         
                          TOM
           OK.
          They meet in the middle of the room again. They share a
          LOVING HANDSHAKE.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Bye.
                         
                          TOM
           Bye.
                         
          Tom leaves Jeanne to it.
                         
          She opens the LARGE WINDOW. We can hear the TRAIN below. She
          says goodbye to the apt. emotionally, CLOSING THE SHUTTER,
          then finally, the window.
                         
                          CUT TO:
           88.
                         
                         
          EXT. PONT DE BIR-HAKEIM - DAY
                         
          We watch Jeanne come out of the APARTMENT BUILDING. She
          climbs the stairs to the RAISED WALKWAY. She is back where it
          all started. We watch her a bit.
                         
          RAISED WALKWAY - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Jeanne walks, in her own world. A somewhat MORE CONTENT world
          now. Back to HERSELF.
                         
          We suddenly see Paul. He watches her for a moment before
          TRAILING HER. He is more DRESSED UP then we have seen him
          previously.
                         
          As she walks, he RUNS UP BEHIND her and playfully taps her on
          her SHOULDER.
                         
          She turns, SURPRISED.
                         
          DIALOGUE IS ENGLISH
                         
                          PAUL
           It's me again.
                         
          She stops and stares at him, DISGUSTED by his GALL and over
          him.
                         
                          JEANNE
           It's over. It's over.
                         
          He doesn't get the hint. He doesn't care what she says. He
          presses on PLAYFULLY.
                         
                          PAUL
           It's over, then it begins again.
                         
                          JEANNE
           What begins again? I don't
           understand anything any more.
                         
                          PAUL
           There's nothing to understand. We
           left the apartment. Now we begin
           again with love and all the rest of
           it.
                         
                          JEANNE
           The rest?
                         
                          PAUL
           Yeah, listen.
                         
          He puts his arm around her as THEY STROLL.
           89.
                         
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           I'm 45. I'm a widower. I've got a
           little hotel, a kind of a dump. But
           it's not completely a flophouse.
           And... I used to live on my luck,
           and I got married. My wife killed
           herself.
                         
          AND WE...
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. SALLE WAGRAM SALON - DAY
                         
          As Paul WAXES ON, we watch a TANGO CONTEST in progress. He
          wanders RUDELY between the DANCERS on the DANCE FLOOR,
          invading their space and lighting a cigarette.
                         
                          PAUL'S VOICE
           But you know, what the hell. I'm...
           no prize. I picked up a nail when I
           was in Cuba in and now I got a
           prostate like an Idaho potato. But
           I'm still a good stick man, even if
           I can't have any children. Let's
           see. I don't have any stomping
           grounds. I don't have any friends.
           I suppose if I hadn't met you, I'd
           probably settle for a hard chair
           and a hemorrhoid. Anyway, to make a
           long, dull story even duller, I
           come from a time when a guy like me
           would drop into a joint like this
           and pick up a young chick like you
           and... and call her a bimbo.
                         
          He reaches the other side of the dance floor where Jeanne
          waits for him. She is able to SMILE now at his SHENANIGANS.
                         
          He has a real JOIE DE VIVRE about him now that he LACKED
          PREVIOUSLY.
                         
          She sits down at a GUEST TABLE on the outskirts of the DANCE
          FLOOR.
                         
          He approaches her table and FEIGNS a GENTLEMAN PERSONA.
                         
                          PAUL
           I'm awfully sorry to intrude
           but I was so struck with your
           beauty that I thought I could offer
           you a glass of champagne. Is this
           seat taken?
           90.
                         
                         
                          JEANNE
           No.
                         
                          PAUL
           May I?
                         
                          JEANNE
           If you'd like to.
                         
          He sits down with her. He CLAPS his hands.
                         
                          PAUL
           Garcon!
                         
          A WAITER comes over.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           You know, the tango is a, is a
           rite. Do you understand "rite"? And
           you must watch the legs of the
           dancers.
                         
          The waiter comes over, he turns to chat with him.
                         
                         DANCE FLOOR
                         
          We watch one of the DANCE COUPLES DANCE THE TANGO. We focus
          on their LEGS and FEET.
                         
          We make it back to Paul and Jeanne and Champagne.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Oh, no! You haven't drunk your
           champagne because it was warm. And
           then I ordered you a Scotch and you
           haven't drunk your Scotch.
                         
                         DANCE FLOOR
                         
          We watch a DIFFERENT COUPLE DANCE.
                         
          Paul tries to BUTTER UP (pardon the pun) Jeanne.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Come on. Just a sip for Daddy.
                         
          She takes a sip from the glass he offers her.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Now, if you love me, you'll drink
           all of it.
                         
                          JEANNE
           OK, I love you.
           91.
                         
                         
          She SLAMS IT BACK.
                         
                          PAUL
           Bravo!
                         
                          JEANNE
           Tell me about your wife.
                         
                          PAUL
           Let's talk about us.
                         
                         
                          JEANNE
           OK. But this place is so pitiful.
                         
                         
                          PAUL
           Yes, but I'm here, aren't I?
                         
          He kisses her on the cheek.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Monsieur Maitre d'Hôtel.
                         
                          PAUL
           That's rather nasty. Anyway, you
           dummy, I love you. And I want to
           live with you.
                         
                          JEANNE
           In your flophouse?
                         
                         
                          PAUL
           In my flophouse. What the hell does
           that mean? What the hell difference
           does it make if I have a flophouse
           or a hotel or a castle? I love you.
           What the fuck difference does it
           make?!
                         
          She PEEKS OUT A SMILE. He may just be WINNING HER BACK OVER.
                         
                         DANCE FLOOR
                         
          We watch a COUPLE as the MUSIC STOPS. All the PATRONS CLAP as
          the DANCE floor clears.
                         
          The PRESIDENT OF THE TANGO CONTEST speaks at a microphone.
                         
                          PRESIDENT
           The jury has chosen the following
           ten best couples: Number 3! 7! 8,9
           ...11, 12...13, 14 ... 15 and 19!
                          (MORE)
           92.
                          PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
           And now, ladies and gentlemen, good
           luck for the last tango!
                         
          More CLAPPING PATRONS.
                         
          We get back to Paul and Jeanne. She sits 2 tables over,
          POUTING, while he struggles to light his CIG. She holds up
          her glass to him.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Give me some more whisky.
                         
                          PAUL
           Oh, I thought you weren't drinking.
                         
                          JEANNE
           But I'm thirsty now and I want some
           more drink.
                         
                          PAUL
           All right. I think that's a good
           idea.
                         
          He starts to bring the bottle to her then stops, gets his
          drink and brings it too.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Wait a minute. Because you're
           really beautiful. Wait a minute.
           I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry. I
           didn't mean to spill my drink.
                         
          He POURS HER SOME. She holds her glass up.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Let's have a toast to our life in
           the hotel.
                         
                          PAUL
           No! Fuck all that! Come on. No.
           Hey, listen. Let's drink a toast to
           our life in the country. Huh?
                         
                          JEANNE
           You're a nature lover? You didn't
           tell me that.
                         
                          PAUL
           Oh, for Chr... I'm a nature boy.
           Can't you see me with the cows and
           the chicken shit all over me?
                         
                          JEANNE
           Oh, yeah. To the house of the cows.
           93.
                         
                         
          She holds her glass up again.
                         
                          PAUL
           Cows.
                         
                          JEANNE
           I will be your cow, too.
                         
                          PAUL
           And listen... I get to milk you
           twice a day. How about that?
                         
          She lays her head on the table.
                         
                          JEANNE
           I hate the country.
                         
                          PAUL
           What do you mean you hate the
           country?
                         
                         
                          JEANNE
           I hate it! I prefer to go to the
           hotel. Come on, let's go...
                         
                          PAUL
           No. Let's dance. Come on. Don't you
           wanna dance? We can start again.
                         
          He crouches down. She CLIMBS ON HIS BACK for a ride. He pulls
          her on her back onto the DANCE FLOOR, through the TANGO
          contest.
                         
          The JURY IS in an UPROAR.
          The tango President FREAKS OUT.
                         
                          PRESIDENT
           That's the limit! What are you
           doing?
                         
          They LIE ON THE FLOOR... They get back up and FEIGN some
          TANGO.
                         
          The President comes out on the floor now to them. She GRABS
          Paul who had DIPPED Jeanne over the JURY TABLE.
                         
                          PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
           You'll have to leave, sir.
                         
          She starts scurrying them off the dance floor.
           94.
                         
                         
                          PAUL
           Madame! 'Tis ever love.
                         
          She continues to SHEW THEM AWAY. And she can hold her own
          against Paul's SMART ASS MOUTH.
                         
                          PRESIDENT
           Go to the circus if you want to see
           love! Go on! Get out of here!
           You'll have to leave.
                         
          Paul now GRABS HER and starts spinning and DANCING WITH HER.
                         
          He SWEEPS HER UP into his arms.
                         
          She struggles and Paul puts her down. She continues to SHEW
          THEM AWAY. PAUL CONTINUES TO MOCK HER.
                         
                          PAUL
           Oh my god, I've never...
                         
          He pulls his pants down and MOONS HER.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Kiss me, sweetheart!
                         
                         
           She is APPALLED and slaps him on the arm as he scoots to the
          door, Jeanne FOLLOWING.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Farewell, you sweet peach blossom.
                         
          As they get to the door he spins one last time.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           I could dance for ever. Oh, my
           hemorrhoid!
                         
                         
          He LOSES HIS BALANCE and slips. Jeanne has to catch him.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Beauty of mine, sit before me. Let
           me peruse you and remember you
           always like this.
                         
          They sit in some tables in a closed, darkened section. Jeanne
          puts her head down on the table in EXHAUSTION.
                         
          He CLAPS LOUDLY till she wakes up. He puts on his ENGLISH
          ACCENT AGAIN.
           95.
                         
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Garcon! Champagne! If music be the
           food of love, play on.
                         
          Jeanne looks OVER IT ALL.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           What's the matter with you?
                         
                          JEANNE
           It's finished.
                         
          She COLLAPSES on the table again. He kisses her head.
                         
                          PAUL
           What's the matter with you?
                         
                          JEANNE
           It's finished!
                         
          He's OBLIVIOUS to her seriousness, AGAIN.
                         
                          PAUL
           What's finished?
                         
                          JEANNE
           We're never going to see each other
           again. Never!
                         
                          PAUL
           That's ridiculous.
                         
          She shakes her head NO.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           That's ridiculous!
                         
                          JEANNE
           It's not a joke.
                         
                          PAUL
           Oh, you dirty rat!
                         
                          JEANNE
           It's finished.
                         
                          PAUL
           Look, when something's finished, it
           begins again.
                         
                          JEANNE
           I'm getting married! I'm going
           away. It's finished.
           96.
                         
                         
          She starts undoing his pants. She starts to PLEASURE HIM.
                         
                          PAUL
           Oh, Jesus. Listen, that's not a
           subway strap, that's me cock!
                         
          She continues...
                         
                          JEANNE
           It's finished!
                         
                          PAUL
           Oh... Jesus...
                         
          She MASTURBATES him to CLIMAX. She gets up, wiping her hands,
          then forehead and LEAVES.
                         
          When he RECOVERS and sees her leaving...
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Wait a minute...
                          (TO HIMSELF)
           You dumb bimbo...
                         
          She doesn't stop.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Shit! Wait a minute. Goddamn it!
           Hey!
                         
          She LEAVES THE SALON. He FOLLOWS her out.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Hey, rube! Come here! Come here!
          He SLIDES DOWN THE BANISTER.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Come heeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrreeeeee!
                         
          She turns to see him coming. She starts RUNNING NOW.
                         
          He still THINKS SHE'S JOKING...
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           I'm gonna get you! Bimbo!
                         
          He SLIDES ACCROSS THE FLOOR.
                         
          She continues RUNNING. She is FREAKED OUT NOW.
                         
                          CUT TO:
           97.
                         
                         
          EXT. PARIS STREET - DAY
                         
          She is RUNNING on the sidewalk past crowds of people, the
          OFFICE OF TOURISM and stores. He is in HOT PURSUIT.
                         
          She stops and turns to have a EMPHATIC SILENT CHAT with him.
          He still finds this to be VERY HUMOROUS. She grows more and
          more SERIOUS and SCARED.
                         
          She starts RUNNING again. But she TIRES OUT in a ...
                         
                         PARKING LOT
                         
          She tries to GET THROUGH TO HIM.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Stop! Stop!
                         
                          PAUL
           Hold it!
                         
          He still DOESN'T GET IT.
                         
                          JEANNE
           It's over!
                         
          He tries to EMBRACE HER.
                         
                          PAUL
           Hey, cool it!
                         
          She THROWS HIM OFF.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Stop it! We're finished.
          He still tries to GRAB HER PURSE. She is ADAMANT.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Go away! Go away! Go away!
                         
          He keeps trying to grab her purse.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Let go! Go away!
                         
          He FEIGNS GIVING UP as she walks on.
                         
                          PAUL
           I can't win. Give me a break!
                         
          She JETS OFF AGAIN and we round a corner...
                         
                         SIDE STREET
           98.
                         
                         
          He keeps his distance on the OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET but
          still doesn't get that SHE IS SERIOUS. She tries to explain
          it to him.
                         
                          JEANNE
           I'll call the police!
                         
          He BLOWS IT OFF.
                         
                          PAUL
           Aha! I smell the henhouse.
                         
          She needs to GO WHERE HE IS. She starts toward him TIMIDLY.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Well, shit, I'm not in your way.
                         
          He feigns a GRAND GESTURE ushering her free travel.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           After you, mademoiselle!
                         
          She TENTATIVELY walks on as he PRETENDS TO ALSO.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           So long, sister. Besides, you're a
           crummy-looking broad. I don't give
           a damn if I never see you again.
           Shit.
                         
          She MAKES A BEE - LINE to her MOTHERS APARTMENT BUILDING.
                         
          He TAKES OFF after her.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          INT. JEANNE'S MOTHERS APT. - LOBBY
                         
          He gets himself BUZZED IN somehow.
                         
          She is SHOCKED, she backs up to the ELEVATOR.
                         
                          JEANNE
           It's over! It's over!
                         
                          PAUL
           Oh, fuck the police.
                         
          She is becoming HYSTERICAL now.
                         
                          JEANNE
           It's over!
           99.
                         
                         
          She makes her way to the
                         
                          PAUL
           Listen, I want to talk to you for
           Christ sake...
                         
          She gets on the OLD FASHIONED LIFT and SLAMS the door in his
          face.
                         
          She begins to ASCEND.
                         
          He FOLLOWS every floor UP THE STAIRS.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Help!
                         
          She is calling to anyone that can hear as he STALKS HER.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Help! Help!
                         
          One FLOOR AFTER ANOTHER...
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Please, help!
                         
          He trips and STUMBLES up the STAIRS after her.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Help! Help!
                         
          Finally at the top, he has to REST against the wall.
                         
                          PAUL
           Oh, man!
          She MAKES A DASH FOR her moms apartment.
                         
          But HE FOLLOWS. He grabs her as she tries to UNLOCK THE DOOR.
                         
          She runs across to the NEIGHBORS DOOR and BANGS ON IT.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Help! Help me! Help!
                         
          He tries to REASON with her.
                         
                          PAUL
           This is getting ridiculous.
                         
          She sees her chance to get back in her moms. She dashes over
          and UNLOCKS THE DOOR and flies inside trying to slam the door
          shut. It's no use, he FORCES HIS WAY IN.
           100.
                         
                         
          She HUSTLES to the DRAWER with her FATHERS GUN... Paul is
          still at the FRONT DOOR.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           It's the title shot, baby. We're
           going all the way. Oh, Christ.
                         
          He shuts the door and WANDERS IN...
                         
                         LIVING ROOM
                         
          Jeanne stands with her back turned staring down into the GUN
          DRAWER.
                         
          He LOOKS AROUND THE PLACE, assessing it...
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           It's a little old, but full of
           memories, huh?
                         
          She stares down still, HITTING HER HEAD on the cabinets to
          help her make a decision...
                         
          Paul finds her FATHERS MILITARY HAT. He puts it on.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Mademoiselle...
                         
          He SALUTES HER and CLICKS HIS HEELS together, playing a role.
                         
          She is incensed that he has dared touch her FATHERS PRECIOUS
          BELONGINGS.
                         
          He PLAYS ON.
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           How do you like your hero? Over
           easy or sunny-side up?
                         
          He REMOVES THE HAT and puts it down.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           You ran through Africa and Asia and
           Indonesia.
                         
          He walks LOVINGLY toward her.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           And now I've found you. And I love
           you.
                         
          He ROMANCES HER, runs his fingers through her hair...
           101.

           I wanna know your name.
                         
          She STARES into his eyes... as she TELLS HIM HER NAME...

           Jeanne...
                         
          ...THE GUN FIRES...
                         
          HE IS SHOCKED BY THE FORCE OF THE BULLET INTO HIS GUT.
                         
          The color DRAINS FROM HIS FACE, his eyes get WOOZY...
                         
          He can only MUTTER.

          He STAGGERS away from her...

          He STAGGERS toward the PORCH DOOR as Jeanne watches...
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Our children... will remember.
                         
          He opens the FRENCH DOORS and STAGGERS onto the PORCH.
                         
          PORCH - CONTINUOUS
                         
          He LOOKS OUT upon the city, and UP TO THE SKY. He takes his
          gum out of his mouth and STICKS IT UNDER THE RAILING.
                         
          His eyes register his BEWILDERMENT as he STARES out into the
          ROOF TOPS.
                         
          We see that he is DEAD -- curled in a FETAL POSITION.

          Jeanne stands in SHOCK with PAUL'S CORPSE in the b.g.
                         
          She mutters to herself the ALIBI FOR THE POLICE.

           I don't know who he is. He followed
           me in the street. He tried to rape
           me. He's a lunatic. I don't know
           what he's called. I don't know his
           name. I don't know who he is. He
           tried to rape me. I don't know. I
           don't know him. I don't know who he
           is. He's a lunatic. I don't know
           his name.
