      "THE ANNIVERSARY PARTY" -- by Alan Cumming & Jennifer Jason Leigh



     FADE IN:

     TIGHT CLOSE - JOE THERRIAN - MORNING

     He's in his mid-thirties, his face relaxed in sleep,
     childlike.  Nestled soundly a tangle in the arms of his wife.

     THE CAMERA STAYS CLOSE.  SLIGHTLY BLURRED, SOFT, SLOWLY
     SWINGS ROUND

     TIGHT CLOSE - SALLY THERRIAN

     She's in her mid-thirties, with large deep eyes.  She watches
     her husband unguarded in sleep.  Her pretty face, alert,
     she's barely breathing.  Traces the just visible lines around
     his eyes, and mouth.  Brushes fingertips against his
     eyelashes.

     TIGHT CLOSE - SALLY'S HAND PULLS THE BEDROOM SHADE.

     It retracts with a loud WHACK, sun, sky, trees.

               STEVEN (O.S.)
          And breath...and chataronga...

     EXT. POOL AREA - DAY

     We're in the middle of a yoga lesson.  Joe and Sally stand on
     their mats.  Steven, their instructor, wanders around the
     couple issuing soft-spoken instructions.

     A large room with hard wood floors, dominated by a huge
     fireplace.  The dining room on one side, living room on the
     other.  Floor to ceiling windows overlook the back porch
     garden pool... The house is classic Neutra.  All GLASS and
     SMOOTH LINES.

     The calm is broken by the telephone.  Joe and Sally ignore it
     until the answering machine picks up.  They break their yoga
     poses and listen.

     The CAMERA hovers over the answering machine.

               LUCY (O.S.)
               (over answering machine; sweet,
                British, slightly desperate)
          Joe, it's Lucy.  Remember me?  It's the
          black sheep here.  Bah...not funny.
          Haven't heard from you, need you, call
          me.  Love you madly.  Hi, Sally.  Joe,
          I'd love to talk to you before I go...

               JOE
          Go where?

               LUCY (O.S.)
               (over answering machine)
          It's a damn nuisance you aren't here, big
          brother.  Sorry I drone on.  I miss you.
          I lo--

     The machine cuts her off.

     NEW ANGLE

     Joe and Sally have resumed their positions.  This wasn't the
     call they were waiting for.

     WIDE SHOT

     AMERICA, forty-one, and ROSA, fifty, struggle up the steps of
     the back porch carrying grocery bags and packages, come
     through the sliding glass door...

     THE CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM

     Through the dining room and into the kitchen, watches the two
     unpack groceries, flowers, etc., and start to dress the
     dining room table.  They speak quietly to each other in
     Spanish.

               JOE
          America, could you just...

     America closes the sliding doors between the kitchen and the
     dining room, giving the couple their privacy.

               JOE (CONT'D)
               (calls out)
          Thank you, America!

               STEVEN
          Okay, let's just take a deep breath, let
          your ribs expand and relax.  And reach up
          and into downward dog.

     Otis, the Bisenji/Sheperd mix, sleeping on his leopard
     pillow, stirs, stretches and groans.

               JOE AND SALLY
          Good boy, Otis.

     The phone RINGS again.

               VOICE (O.S.)
               (over answering machine)
          Hello, I have Dr. Harmon calling for
          Sally Therrian.

     Sally jumps out of the down dog position and runs to the
     phone, all angles.

               SALLY
          Hello, hi, hi...and?  Thank God.

     Sally stands with the phone to her ear, her back to Joe.

     EXT. POOL AREA - CONTINUOUS

     Joe watches her from his position, not concentrating on the
     teacher waiting a sign.  Sally returns to the lesson.  They
     do their handstands against the wall, on either side of the
     front door.

               SALLY
          No luck.

               JOE
          Oh, well, we'll just have to try again.
          Sound like a plan?

     Sally nods, she and Joe, at Steven's instructions, come out
     of their handstands and lie on the floor in a stretched
     relax, facing one another.

               SALLY
          Happy anniversary, baby.

               JOE
          Happy anniversary.

     They smile.

               STEVEN
          And change sides...

     America slides open the dining room doors.  The dining table
     is covered with bundles of freshly cut flowers.  Rosa is
     singing in Spanish.

               AMERICA
               (with the authority of long
                years of service)
          Mr. Joe, we have to have the house.  If
          you please now...

               JOE
          It's yours.

     The CAMERA glances off photos of the couple: portraits and
     candids, their wedding day, with friends, on vacation,
     tumbling on the lawn, and the like.
     Some framed and hung, some taped to the fridge or simply
     leaning on a shelf.  It's clear that at least a handful are
     by the same photographer, black and whites, grainy and
     beautiful.

     There are lots of photos of Joe and his sister Lucy,
     documenting their relationship from childhood.  There's an
     ANNIE LEIBOWITZ photo-shoot of Sally carelessly displayed
     somewhere.

     INT. BEDROOM - LATER

     Joe stands behind Sally in front of the full length mirror,
     his arms around her, stroking her belly.

               JOE
          I love you.  Most beautiful woman in the
          world.

               SALLY
          Hardly...

               JOE
          Accept a compliment.

               SALLY
          I think you're the most beautiful woman
          in the world.

     They move toward the bed.

               JOE
          What did you get me?

               SALLY
          In the morning, after everyone's gone and
          there's just us.

     She pushes him on the bed.

               JOE
          Kiss my eyes.

     She does.

               SALLY
          My wrists.

     He does.

               JOE
          Kiss the back of my knees.

               SALLY
          Through the sweats or not?

               JOE
          Not.

     She pulls down his sweats.  She kisses the back of his knees.
     He turns, stares up at her.

               SALLY
          What?

               JOE
          You didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did
          you?

     Sally shakes her head.

               SALLY
          No.  Did you?

               JOE
               (after a beat)
          No.  I missed that.

               SALLY
          I missed all of you.  We're okay, aren't
          we?

               JOE
          We're great.

               SALLY
          I mean, you're really back.

               JOE
          For good.

     They begin to make love...the phone RINGS.

               JOE (CONT'D)
          Don't get it.

               SALLY
          Well, it might be Clair.  They're
          threatening not to come...

               JOE
          What?

               SALLY
          They can't find a sitter...
               (into the receiver)
          Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.
               (she looks at Joe)
          Just a moment.
               (puts the call on hold)
          It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions
          to the house.  You invited Skye fucking
          Davidson to our anniversary party?

               JOE
          Okay.  I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell
          you.  It was the only chance I had to
          meet her.

               SALLY
          You invited her to our anniversary party?
          I didn't even invite my mother.

               JOE
          She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally,
          I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on
          hold.

               SALLY
               (pissed)
          No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking
          Davidson, for fuck's sake.

               JOE
               (regards her)
          You want me to uninvite her?

               SALLY
          No, no of course not.  How old is she?
          Twenty-fucking-two?

     She gets out of bed, starts into the bathroom.  The CAMERA is
     with her.

               SALLY (CONT'D)
               (into the bathroom mirror)
          And she's a stinking fucking actress, for
          fuck's sake.

               JOE
               (into the receiver)
          Skye!
               (his face lights)
          I'm so glad you're able to make it...it's
          our sixth, actually.
               (flattered)
          You read the book again?  Well, no, the
          ending to chapter six...it's just that
          it's not filmic.
          We tried it in an earlier draft, but, it
          just wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can
          absolutely look at that again.  If you're
          coming from Laurel, you want to take
          Sunset west, we're just past Will Rogers
          State Park.  Three blocks west of that,
          you want to hang right.  It's about three
          quarters of a mile up a big white thing
          on the left.

     Sally's started the bath, and is watching him from the
     doorway.  He meets her eyes mid-sentence.

               JOE (CONT'D)
          Oh?  I don't think tonight.  I'm sure
          they're well behaved.  All our friends
          have dogs, and they always want to bring
          them.  We'd be outnumbered, you see?  So
          we sort of put a ban on it.  Sorry.

     He rolls his eyes.  Sally walks back into the bathroom, she
     isn't buying it.

               JOE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          I'm looking forward to meeting you, too.
          And Skye, I'm thrilled that you're
          willing to take this leap with me.
          Eternally grateful, really.

               SALLY
               (into the bathroom mirror)
          I'm going to throw up.

               JOE (O.S.)
          I can't imagine anyone else playing
          Genna.

               SALLY
               (sanguine)
          Really?

     INT. BEDROOM - LATER

     The doorbell rings.  There are two closed doors on either
     side of the room.  The bed shows no sign of consummated sex.
     Joe comes through the left hand door, nearly dressed.

               JOE
          Who the fuck can be here at this time?
          It's not even seven!

     Sally comes through the other door, one shoe off, one on.

               SALLY
          Oh Jesus, who else is always early for
          Christ's sake?

     NEW ANGLE

     Sally kisses his cheek on her way to the door.

               SALLY (CONT'D)
          Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors.

               JOE
          I'll say as little as possible.

     Sally exits the bedroom.

     HOLD ON JOE

     For a moment, then Sally re-enters, kisses him deeply.

               SALLY
          I love you.

     INT. FOYER - EARLY EVENING

     The house is filled with exquisite flower arrangements,
     candles everywhere.

     JERRY and JUDY ADAMS are on the porch, just beyond the glass
     of the front door.  Their argument is inaudible.  They're in
     their mid-thirties, conservatively dressed.  She's stunning,
     genetically nervous.  Jerry carries a briefcase.  She's got
     the gift.

     Sally opens the door.  Hugs and buses them, hello.

               JUDY
          I know we're early, we're so early.
          Sorry.

               JERRY
          You have to sign your taxes anyway.

               SALLY
               (a grin)
          Of course we do.
               (to Judy)
          We have to sign our taxes.

               JOE
               (kisses Judy; all charm)
          You can never be too early or too thin.

               JERRY
          Happy anniversary, buddy!  Six months
          ago, who would have thunk it?

     Jerry hugs Joe.

               JOE
               (sotto)
          Well, not me, to be honest.

               JERRY
               (sotto)
          Don't fuck up again.  It's got a ripple
          effect.  Sally suffers, we all suffer.

               JUDY
               (offers)
          We have a gift?

               JOE
          Thanks, I'll take that.  Champagne?

               JUDY
          Lovely.

     Joe moves toward the kitchen.

               JERRY
               (a moment, to Sally)
          We closed.

               SALLY
          Fantastic.
               (takes his hand)
          Out here.

     They step out onto the porch.  Judy's left alone, unsure
     whether to follow or not.

               JUDY
               (finally, to no one, and to no
                response)
          The house looks beautiful, are those
          hydrangeas?

     She stands awkwardly in the middle of the foyer.

     EXT. PORCH - CONTINUOUS

               JERRY
          Joe officially owns No. 4, Cheyenne Walk,
          Chelsea, London, England.  No small
          doing.

               SALLY
          I love you, you're a genius.

     Behind them, in the foyer, Judy wanders aimlessly.

               JERRY
          I suppose.  Sally, that's quite a gift.
          I'm not sure it's in your best interest.

               SALLY
          I adore him.

               JERRY
          The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the
          morning.  The house had to go on the
          market to insure the loan on the London
          flat.

               SALLY
          I know.  I know that.  Don't spoil it.

               JERRY
          What you earn has to double in order to
          cover expenses in London, it's an
          outrageously expensive city.

               SALLY
          We've only been over this how many times?

               JERRY
          You only made half your quote this year.

               SALLY
          Well, you're a tower of support.

               JERRY
          I worry because you don't.  It's my job.
          I'm feeling guilty.  I would've liked it
          if you waited until the two of you were
          on more solid ground.

               SALLY
               (direct, simple)
          We couldn't be on more solid ground.

               JERRY
          Whatever you say.  Listen, I love you.

     Otis is barking.

               JOE (O.S.)
          Otis!  No barking!

               SALLY
               (touched)
          And Joe's huge in Europe.  He's like a
          rock star in London.  His novels sell
          millions.

               JERRY
          Not millions.

               SALLY
          He's directing now.

               JERRY
          They're paying him scale.

     The CAMERA catches sight of Joe behind them.  He moves
     through the foyer and into the living room with a tray of
     glasses and Judy in tow.

               SALLY
          He gets huge advances on his novels.
          He's going back to that.  You know how he
          hates it here.

               JERRY
          There's still time to undo this.

               SALLY
               (kisses his cheek)
          We'll be fine.

               JERRY
               (re: barking dog)
          Did you invite them?

               SALLY
          The Roses?  And of course they said yes.

               JERRY
          That was the plan.  And you're thrilled
          to have them.

               SALLY
          Whatever you say.

               JERRY
          Did you tell Joe to behave?

               SALLY
          Yes.

               JERRY
          Did he promise?

               SALLY
          Scout's honor.

               JERRY
          Before I forget.
               (pulls a novel from his
                briefcase)
          Put it on the bookshelf.

     She flips the book -- on the back is a full page picture of
     RYAN ROSE.

               SALLY
          You're out of your mind.

               JERRY
          Just do what I say, alright?

               SALLY
          How much bowing and scraping do you want
          us to do?

               JERRY
          Beats a lawsuit.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Joe and Judy sit on opposite sides of the sofa -- slightly
     uncomfortable with each other.

               JOE
               (to fill the silence,
                conspiratorial grin)
          I love gifts.  What did you guys get us?

               JUDY
               (chokes on the champagne)
          Nothing that can't be exchanged.

               JOE
          Oh.  Well.  Good.

               JUDY
          Congratulations on the deal.  How
          exciting.  Is Sally doing Sally?  I mean
          it's Sally.  The character that's based
          on Sally.  The character that's based on
          Sally in the book.

               JOE
          The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing
          the lead.

               JUDY
          Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan.
          She's very beautiful.

               JOE
          Yes, she is.

               JUDY
               (trying harder)
          But I am right, yes?  She's based on
          Sally.

               JOE
          It's a novel.

               JUDY
          Still.  Well.  Let's drop it.

               JOE
          Yes.

               JUDY
          I'm not much of a reader, but I do love
          autobiographies, even biographies
          sometimes.  Mostly non-fiction.  Did you
          read the new Styron?

               JOE
          No.

               JUDY
          It's very good.
               (a moment)
          I understand you won the Booker Prize.

               JOE
          Yes I did.

               JUDY
               (another moment)
          Is your script much like the novel?
          Jerry says it's very good.  But you know,
          you read the novel, and then you see the
          movie - and most of the time you say,
          "what's this?" You know?  I sometimes
          think we're better off not reading the
          novel at all.  Because, we come with
          expectations... and of course, we know
          where we're going.  Don't you find?

               JOE
          Don't I find what?

               JUDY
          I don't know why Joe, we've known each
          other how long...

               JOE
          Not long.

               JUDY
               (benign)
          Don't be silly.

               JOE
          Joking.

               JUDY
          Yes I know.  I started to say... I
          started to say Joe that --

               JOE
          Do I put you off?

               JUDY
          You manage to throw me off balance.  I
          adore you.

               JOE
          And I you.

               JUDY
          But I'm always afraid I'll say something
          stupid.

               JOE
          Ah.

               JUDY
          And so I always manage to, do you see?
          Like the book/script thing, do you see?

               JOE
          Mmm hmmm.

     INT. FOYER

     CAL and SOPHIA GOLD are there with their children - JACK and
     EVIE - eight and six respectively.  Carrying gifts and totes
     with toys and changes.  Jerry and Sally have gathered them up
     and ushered them in.

               SALLY
          You know Jerry.

               CAL
          Yes, of course.

               SOPHIA
          I'm the wife.  We've met.

               JERRY
               (hugs her)
          You, I know.

               SALLY
               (to Evie)
          Hey, beautiful girl.

     She picks up the four-year-old, swings her around.  Jack
     hides behind his father's legs.

               SOPHIA
               (a grin)
          Jack?  Jack, you promised.

     The little boy comes out from behind his father's legs,
     covers his eyes with his hands.

               JACK
               (sings)
          Happy anniversary to you.  We're glad Joe
          came home.  Don't split up again.  Cause
          we like the food.

     Much laughter and clapping.

               JOE
               (in the archway)
          Jack.  Did you compose that yourself?

               CAL
          Absolutely.

               JOE
          Had a little help?

               CAL
          Absolutely not.

               JOE
          It has your ring.

               CAL
          I'm not that good.

               JERRY
          Cal, my wife Judy.

               JUDY
          Nice to meet you.

               CAL
          I think we've met, actually.  No?  At
          another one of these things?

               JUDY
          No, I don't think so.

               JERRY
               (to Cal)
          Congratulations on the Academy Award.
          Great performance.  Really warranted.

               SOPHIA
          He thought so.

               JERRY
          Sally always manages to get robbed.

               SALLY
               (a mortified grin)
          Enough about me.

               SOPHIA
          Evie has a little something for you.

     Evie shakes her head.

               SOPHIA (CONT'D)
          You do.

               EVIE
               (even)
          I don't think so.

               SALLY
          Since when are you so shy?

               EVIE
               (her mother's daughter)
          Never.

               SOPHIA
               (bright smile)
          Honey, we have gifts for you and all
          sorts of surprises.  Where is America?  I
          know she's here somewhere.

     Joe reaches for the gifts.

               JOE
          I'll take them.

               SOPHIA
          No, I have a little talking to do with
          America.  Privately.  I'll find her.

               SALLY
               (to Sophia)
          In the kitchen.

               JOE
          Who'd like to go and find Otis?

               EVIE
          Me!

               JACK
          I guess.

               JUDY
          The infamous dog?

               JOE
          He's the best dog in the world.
               (to Judy)
          They're both coming tonight.  Not my
          idea.

               JUDY
          Ours.

               JOE
          It's Jerry's worst idea.

               CAL
          What's that?

               JOE
          The neighbors from hell.  The kind that
          lay in wait.  I'd rather move actually.
          Wouldn't I?
               (to Sally)
          Wouldn't I?

               SALLY
               (small smile)
          Yes.

               JOE
               (to the kids)
          Okay.  Last one to find Otis is a smelly
          old bum.

     Joe goes off with the children to find Otis.  Cal sits at the
     piano, plays.

                     INT. FOYER - FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS

     Joe holds Evie in one arm.  Jack stands beside him, holds his
     hand.  MONICA and RYAN ROSE face him across the threshold --
     the NEXT DOOR NEIGHBORS.  She's in her late twenties - and
     beautiful, eyes everywhere - star struck and house struck.
     Ryan is somewhat older, a little awkward in company,
     swallowing resentment and a little self righteous.

               JOE
          Well, hello you two.
               (putting Evie down; to Jack)
          These are the people who live next door.
          Say hello.

     Jack does.

               JOE (CONT'D)
          And close the door, Jack.  Because if we
          leave it open, Otis will run out and you
          know what will happen then?

               JACK
          Uh, uh.

               JOE
          He'll run next door into their backyard
          and he'll bark and bark and bark and eat
          their pitbull for his dinner.  Is it a
          pitbull?

               RYAN
               (not amused)
          No, actually.

               JOE
               (to Jack)
          Oh whatever.  We don't want that to
          happen, do we?

               JACK
          No?

               RYAN
          It's a rottweiler, actually.
               (to Jack)
          I don't think our rottweiler is in any
          danger, Jack.

               JOE
          Well, Jack and I are very relieved.

               RYAN
          I thought this was a party.  Are we going
          to talk about the dog thing?

               MONICA
          Please, Ryan.

               JOE
               (kisses her cheek and shakes
                his hand)
          No, he's absolutely right.  You're
          absolutely right, Ryan.  Dog talk must be
          banned.  Canine conversations are
          completely discouraged... it's really
          good of you to join us.  Can I get you a
          drink?

               RYAN
          Not for me, thanks.

     An awkward moment.

               MONICA
               (checks with Ryan)
          Something soft.

               JOE
          Right away.  Are you sure you wouldn't
          like something soft, Ryan?

               RYAN
          I'm sure, yes.

     Sally has watched some of this from the archway, joins them
     super-friendly.

               SALLY
          Hi.  Monica and Ryan?

               MONICA
          Sally?

               SALLY
          Yes.  And you've met Joe.

               RYAN
          Yes.

               SALLY
               (a deep breath)
          Well, so glad you decided to come.

               MONICA
          We could hardly say no.

               SALLY
          Oh?

     Joe slips the coke into Monica's hand.

               SALLY (CONT'D)
               (takes the gift)
          Thank you.  This was so unnecessary.  I
          hope you've noticed that Otis isn't
          barking as much.  We keep him in at
          night.

               RYAN
          At 4:30 today he barked for a solid
          fifteen minutes.  I have it on tape.

               SALLY
          You're keeping a record, are you?

               RYAN
          It's just very distracting when you're
          trying to work.

               MONICA
          Ryan.

               RYAN
               (to Joe)
          I'm sure you understand.

               SALLY
          Well the neighborhood is full of dogs,
          and it's not always Otis.

               RYAN
          Well today it was Otis.  And you should
          keep him away from our yard.  Because
          Sheila will defend herself.

               MONICA
          Ryan!

               SALLY
               (cuts off response from Joe; to
                Ryan)
          Are you working on a new book?

               RYAN
               (caught short; flattered)
          Well, yes, actually.

               MONICA
          He always has two or three going...

               SALLY
          Really?  Joe can't manage more than one
          at a time.  With huge gaps in between.

     NEW ANGLE

     MAC and CLAIR FORSYTHE wave from the door.  Clair's arms are
     full of presents.  Mac carries three video cameras under his
     arm.  He's got Otis by the collar.

               MAC
          You lose this?

               JOE
               (re: Otis)
          Ah there's our snookums now.

               RYAN
          Yes, well, but I haven't won a Booker
          either.  Or the Whitebread.

               MAC
          The gate was open.

               SALLY
          Well, not yet.
               (she reacts to Mac)
          The gate was open?

               JOE
          It's taken care of.

               MONICA
          I think Ryan needs a new publisher.  I
          think he's outgrown him.  They're just
          not doing their job.

     A silence.  Awkward smiles go all around.

               SALLY
          Hors d'oeuvres or something?

               MONICA
          Yes, great!  It's a beautiful house.

               SALLY
          Thank you.  I understand you're an
          interior decorator.

               MONICA
          Yes.

               SALLY
          I so wish I'd known.

               MONICA
          Well, whoever did this is amazing.

               SALLY
          I did it.

               JOE
               (comes on them with the
                Forsythes in tow)
          She rarely cops to it.
               (kisses Sally's cheek)
          Otis is home.

               CLAIR
               (re: the gifts)
          Where can I put these?

     Sally takes the gifts from her.

               CLAIR (CONT'D)
          What a fucking day!  We only just got a
          sitter.  I don't know her from fucking
          Adam.  She could be a serial killer.  I'm
          going to have to call every ten minutes.
          You have to let me give out the number.

               SALLY
          Of course.

               MAC
          She already has.

               CLAIR
          It's alright, isn't it?

               SALLY
          Of course it's alright.

               MAC
          Clair is a hovering mother.

               CLAIR
          I'm not.

               SALLY
          This is Monica and Ryan.  Mac and Clair.

     Clair takes a glass of champagne off the tray as they make
     their way down the hall.

               CLAIR
               (a wide professionally
                ingratiating smile)
          So nice...

               MONICA
          And for us... Truly.

               CLAIR
          Well...

               MONICA
          You will never know.

               CLAIR
               (pleased)
          Oh.
               (to Sally)
          I have a four-thirty call.  AM.  So we
          may have to leave early.

               SALLY
          Why didn't you bring him?

               CLAIR
          What?

               SALLY
          Why didn't you bring him?

               CLAIR
               (searches)
          He's allergic.

               SALLY
          Oh.

               CLAIR
          To dander.  Otis.

               SALLY
          Oh.

               CLAIR
          Didn't I say?

               SALLY
          Well, probably.

               CLAIR
          They can tell from the eyelashes, you
          know?  He's got eyelashes yay long.  They
          must be a foot long.  The older you are
          when you have a baby, the more likely
          this stuff is to crop up.

               SALLY
               (muted)
          Oh.

     The Roses are happy to stand there on the fringe.  Next to
     someone they've only seen on screen and magazine covers.

     Clair's not in the least put off by them.  She manages to
     smile at them inclusively from time to time.

               CLAIR
          So they tell me.  Not soon enough, of
          course.
               (kisses her cheek)
          How are you, Sal?  You look fantastic.
          It changes your life, you know.  A baby.
          It puts everything in perspective,
          doesn't it.  Doesn't it, Mac?  You can't
          be the center of your own world, anymore.

               MAC
               (as grounded as Clair isn't)
          It's an object lesson in grace.
               (on seeing Cal Gold on the back
                porch)
          Wow!  Look who's here before me!  My
          leading man is on time for once.

               CAL
               (at the piano)
          Those who can't direct.

               MAC
          Fuck you.

     EXT. POOL AREA

     Mac and Cal sit on the porch sharing a joint.  Cal is maybe
     the only living complete works of Shakespeare and pulls out
     his most arcane quotes on occasion.

               CAL
          Are those our dailies?  You're totally
          outrageous.  It's their anniversary.  Is
          nothing sacred!  Well...so...how am I?

               MAC
               (laughing)
          Oh man, you are so fucking funny in the
          kitchen scene.

               CAL
          I liked the third take, the accidental
          disaster with the silverware.

               MAC
          Nothing you do is accidental...

     MEDIUM FULL SHOT

     The CAMERA spots GINA TAYLOR through moving bodies.  Tall,
     beautiful, centered grace.  She's got a Leica around her
     neck... drops her two large camera bags on the floor.

     Several of the other guests greet her, Mac among them.

     TIGHT CLOSE

     Joe sweeps her up to his arms.  It's an intimate,
     appreciative embrace.  Theirs was a mid-30s relationship,
     certainly pre-Sally.  Maybe his first important love.

               GINA
               (re: the cameras)
          I'm the hired help.

               JOE
               (affectionate)
          Fuck you.

               GINA
          I never put myself in harm's way.

               JOE
          Anymore.

               GINA
          No, not anymore.  Happy anniversary,
          scout.

     NEW ANGLE

     Sophia bursts from the kitchen.

               SOPHIA
          Oh my God!  America told me your
          neighbors are coming?

               SALLY
          And here they are!

               SOPHIA
          And she was saying how happy you were to
          finally have them over.  Because you're
          both, so, what - introspective?  And you
          should have done it ages ago.  I'm Sophia
          Gold.
               (rescuing Sally)
          Come meet my husband, Cal.

               MONICA
          Cal Gold?

               SOPHIA
          The very one.  And you are...

               SALLY
          Monica and Ryan.

               RYAN
          Rose.

               SOPHIA
          Sorry?

               RYAN
          Ryan Rose.

               SOPHIA
          Yes.

     She shakes his hand.  He's amazed at the solid grip.

               SALLY
          He's a novelist.

               SOPHIA
          Ah.

               SALLY
          Like Joe.

               SOPHIA
          Hmm.
               (to Sally)
          Where are my kids?

               SALLY
          In the guest room.  I've laid out a paint
          table for them.

               SOPHIA
          I hope they're watercolors!

               SALLY
          Nevermind.

               SOPHIA
               (to Monica)
          Would you like to meet my husband?

     It's all Monica can do to keep from putting her hand to her
     chest.

               MONICA
          I'd be thrilled.

               SOPHIA
          Then he'll be thrilled.

     She ushers them toward the living room.

               JOE
               (re: Sophia, appreciative)
          She's such pure evil.

     Sally approaches, gives Gina a warm kiss on the chest.

               SALLY
          Thanks for coming.

               GINA
          Happy anniversary.  You're a good match,
          you two.
               (to Joe)
          Can you help me with this stuff?

               JOE
               (re: one of her bags)
          That for us?

               GINA
          What a nose.  You missed your calling.

               JOE
          Can I open it?

               GINA
               (defers)
          Sally?

               JOE
          Please?

               SALLY
          He's impossible.  Go on then.

     Joe rips open the gift.  It's a framed black and white of
     Joe, Sally and Otis lying on the couch.  It's clear which
     photos in the house are Gina's.  It's a breathtaking print,
     an amazing caught moment.  All light and shadow.  A touching
     study.

               SALLY (CONT'D)
               (respectful of the talent)
          It's beautiful, thank you so much.

     Joe, moved somehow, hugs Gina to him.  Kisses her.

               JOE
          I love you,  Gina Taylor.

     Sally's uncomfortable, a little jealous... feels intrusive.
     Aware that Gina got there first.  Knew him when.  And always
     captures something naked and vulnerable in his face.

                                 CUT TO:

     INT. GUEST ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     In the center of the room a low table with paints and crayons
     and glue and baubles.  Two child size chairs either side.
     Empty, the table hasn't been touched.

     Evie stands against the far wall.  She wears a helmet and is
     surrounded by toy suction arrows.  The arrows make a perfect
     outline of her head and body.  Jack stands three feet away,
     bow in hand -- the archer prepares his next shot.

     INT. LIVING ROOM

     Cal is at the piano, charming the neighbors.  Judy chats with
     Mac.  Jerry is on his cellphone, holding his Palm Pilot, his
     hand pressed against his ear to block out the chatter.  Sally
     joins Cal on the piano stool.  Sophia moves to Clair on the
     couch, kisses her cheek.

               SOPHIA
          You look so well, Clair.  A wraith.

               CLAIR
               (pleased)
          You think so!?  I've been working out a
          lot since the baby.
          And I've been working.  And that takes
          it's toll, you know.

               SOPHIA
          I'm glad that's all over for me.

               CLAIR
          Don't you miss it?

               SOPHIA
          Never.

               CLAIR
          Really.

               SOPHIA
          Not for a second.  Cal can have all that.

               CLAIR
          Really?

               SOPHIA
          So where is young Jonah?

               CLAIR
          With a sitter.  We have a sensational
          sitter.  Jonah's really comfortable with
          her.  You know, a second mom sort of.
          Like part of the family.  Amazing with
          kids.

     She inadvertently touches the beeper on her belt, and it
     beeps.  She jumps.

               SOPHIA
          What is that thing?

               CLAIR
          So this sitter can always reach me.  I'm
          still not used to leaving him.

               SOPHIA
          You should have brought him.

               CLAIR
               (shrugs)
          Dander.  He's allergic.  Otis.

               SOPHIA
          Oh.  Do you have any pictures?

               CLAIR
          Pictures.  They're always in my tote.  I
          left my tote in the damn trailer.  But!
          He's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac
          shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact
          is they probably didn't even need me for
          this birth.

               SOPHIA
          Are you the funniest person I know, or
          what?

               CLAIR
          I can't think how you gave it all up,
          Soph.

     Sophia sends her a soft, content smile.  Otis comes over and
     nuzzles Clair's knee.

               CLAIR (CONT'D)
               (freeks)
          Oh my God, the dog!

     INT. KITCHEN/HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

     Clair leads Sally towards the bedroom.

               CLAIR
          It sounds hysterical, but Otis just
          rubbed up against me and I'd kind of like
          to change into something of yours.  You
          know it could be disaster.  He's so
          allergic.  It's terrifying.

               SALLY
          Borrow whatever you like.

               CLAIR
          I'll change back before we leave.

               SALLY
               (pointed)
          Whatever you like.  I'm afraid it'll all
          be too big for you.
               (a moment)
          Are you alright, Clair?

               CLAIR
          I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Well, I'm a little
          stressed.  And I've been taking pills to
          get my weight down since the baby.

               SALLY
          I'd say it was down.

               CLAIR
          And the doctor said they might make me a
          little jumpy.  I've got a ghastly
          headache, actually.

               SALLY
          You want a Tylenol, or something?

               CLAIR
          I'd love a Xanex.
               (a moment)
          Sally, please don't tell Sophia that I'm
          not breast feeding.

               SALLY
          Why would she care?

               CLAIR
          You know Sophia.  She's so damned
          judgemental.  And she's so damned...
          perfect.  And so fucking... serene.  Just
          fucking don't tell her.  Because you know
          Mac thinks she's God.  And I can feel him
          comparing.

               SALLY
          You need to knock off the pills, Clair.

               CLAIR
          Just don't fucking tell her.

               SALLY
          It's not going to come up.

     INT. FOYER - LEVI PANES THROUGH THE GLASS DOOR - DAY

     A Peter Sellers look-a-like holding a violin case.

               JOE
               (opens the door)
          Panes!  How are you?

               PANES
          Oh, you know, I am.

               JOE
          Has she called?

               PANES
          She'll never call again.  She called last
          week to tell me she'll never call again.
          Where's Sally?

               SALLY (O.S.)
          Here I am.  Panes, my love!

     Sally starts down the hallway.

               SALLY (CONT'D)
               (for Panes; a long supportive
                hug; a kiss)
          Good, you brought your violin.  I want
          you to play.

               PANES
          It's a machine gun.  I thought I'd kill
          myself.

               SALLY
          Are you lovesick?

               PANES
          Suicidal.  It's much less codependent.

               SALLY
          Will champagne help?

               PANES
          Not enough.

     Sally takes Panes into the living room where everyone chats,
     drinks, smokes.  They all like each other out of habit, if
     nothing else.  Ryan and Monica are on the fringe, stand at
     the edges of conversation.  There's always someone at the
     piano, and they can all pretty much play.

               SALLY
          Panes is here!

               PANES
               (gives everyone a shy, pained
                little wave)
          Oh great.

     Everyone stops, turns, toasts.

               EVERYONE
          Panes!

               MONICA/RYAN
               (a little late; into silence)
          Panes.

     Panes gives them another little wave.  Doorbell rings.

     TIGHT CLOSE - SKYE DAVIDSON

               SKYE
          Hi.

     She's the young, beautiful actress who'll play the lead in
     Joe's film.

               JOE
               (his face lights up)
          Skye!

     She's in jeans, but somehow looks dressed to the 9s.

               SKYE
          You're Joe, aren't you?
               (nods knowingly)
          I recognized you from the book jacket.

     Joe grins from ear to ear.  Uncharacteristically star struck
     in front of this beauty.

               JOE
          How do you do, Skye?

               SKYE
          Oh, I love that.
               (throws arms around him)
          I'm just great.  I'm so happy to be here.
          And I apologize for invading you.  And
          I'm so happy you asked me to.  I'm so
          touched.  I know how private you and
          Sally are.

               JOE
               (uncomfortable)
          Yeah, well, it's just us and a few
          hundred of our closest friends.

               SKYE
               (genuine)
          When I read your work I felt that you
          knew me.  Women must tell you that.  And
          this one in particular speaks to me, do
          you know?  I am Genna.  How many women
          must tell you that.  And the script is
          wonderful.  Wonderful and lean and
          visual...

               JOE
          I'm so happy you like it.  I'm so
          relieved you said yes, and I'm really,
          um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to
          finally meet you.

               SKYE
          You're going to be a remarkable director,
          a brilliant director.

     There's a long moment.

               JOE
               (finally)
          I think you're my first Goddess.

     Sally and Panes have been watching from the living room.

               PANES
          She's even better looking in the flesh.

               SALLY
          Really?  I need a drink.  Come hide with
          me.

     INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

     America and Rosa are working at the counter, Panes and Sally
     come through.

               SALLY
          Oh, Jesus, Panes.  I can't, I can't
          believe that bitch is in my house.

               PANES
          You don't know she's a bitch.

               SALLY
          She's all over him, are you blind?

               PANES
          It could be worse.

               SALLY
          How?

               PANES
          She could be playing the role in Joe's
          movie that should be yours.

               SALLY
          Fuck you, Panes.

               PANES
          You see, that's worse.

               SALLY
          I just wanted tonight to be with the
          people we love.

               PANES
          Like your business managers?

               SALLY
          They're not just our business managers,
          Panes.

               PANES
          Oh, okay, forgive me.  Your neighbors are
          here, for fuck's sake.

               SALLY
          Exactly what I mean.  It's all ruined.

               PANES
          It's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  It's
          one of your parties.

               SALLY
          I don't want it to be just one of our
          parties.

               PANES
          "How are you really doing, Panes?"
          "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."

               SALLY
          Like the last time.

               PANES
          No.  No, not like the last time.  She was
          the rest of my life.

               SALLY
          Like the last time.

               PANES
          I wasn't finished.

               SALLY
          Okay.

               PANES
          "We can't stand seeing you like this,
          Panes.  I hate you being alone.  Why
          don't you stay with us for a while?"
          "I'd love to, thanks."

               SALLY
          It's our anniversary, Panes.

               PANES
          I didn't hear me say tonight.

               SALLY
          We're just feeling our way back.

               PANES
          "Otherwise, we'd insist on your being
          here."

               SALLY
          You know it's true.

     Skye bursts into the kitchen, Sally and Panes freeze.

               SKYE
               (stuck)
          Oh my God, sorry.  I'm interrupting.

               SALLY
          I'll be right out.

               PANES
               (over Sally)
          Come on in.

               SKYE
          I'm in the same room with Sally Nash.  Oh
          my God.  You're my icon.  I've been
          watching your films since I was a little
          girl.  Like, four years ago I followed
          you all around the Beverly Center - at
          least half a day, working up the courage
          to introduce myself.

     Joe enters the kitchen, watches.

               SALLY
          I don't think I ever spent half a day in
          the Beverly Center.

               SKYE
          Whatever, do you remember?  I've seen all
          your movies.  When I was in rehab, the
          second time, they wouldn't even let us
          see your drug addict movie.  They said
          you were too real.  I worship you.  And I
          couldn't be more flattered, because I
          know the part I'm playing in Joe's movie
          is based on you as a young woman.

     Joe winces, uncomfortable, picks up the bottle of wine and
     leaves.

               SKYE (CONT'D)
          And I'm overwhelmed.  And I want to do it
          justice.  And I hope we can spend time
          together.  And I'm gushing.  It's my
          worst quality.

               PANES
          Not at all.

               SKYE
          Oh my god.  I've been so rude.  I'm Skye
          Davidson.  Has anyone ever told you, you
          look like Peter Sellers?

               PANES
          No, never.

               SALLY
               (overlapping Panes)
          Everyday.

               PANES
          I'm Levi Panes.  Will you excuse us,
          Skye?  It's time for Sally's meds.

     Panes steers Sally out of the kitchen.

               SALLY
          It's nice to meet you... again.

     They go.  Skye is left in the kitchen alone.

               SKYE
               (to America)
          Oh my God, she remembers me!

     INT. FOYER - MEDIUM CLOSE

     Sally and Panes start down the hall in search of privacy.

               SALLY
               (under her breath)
          Thank you, thank you, thank you.

               CLAIR
               (on the way down; a dream in
                white)
          My God, your wardrobe is incredible.  It
          took me forever to decide.  Oh, and I
          found Dr. X, thank you.  You saved my
          life.

     She moves past them.

               SALLY
               (a moment; sotto)
          Shit!

               PANES
               (re: the dress)
          I'd cut off her red wine if I were you.

               SALLY
          Shit.  It's my Galiano.

               PANES
          What does that mean?

               SALLY
          About five thousand dollars.  With my
          discount.

     The CAMERA follows them into the bedroom.  They flop down
     onto the bed and into FRAME.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     More guests have arrived.  Sophia and her children play with
     Otis.  America and Rosa pass round hot hors d'oeuvres.

     Joe places Gina's photo on the mantelpiece.

               GINA
               (regards him)
          Directing suits you.

               JOE
          I'm not so sure.  Look again in three
          months.

               GINA
          It must be nice having so many strangers
          kiss your ass all of a sudden.

               JOE
          Ow!  Gina, you obviously need to get
          fucked.

               GINA
          Just did.  Jealous?

               JOE
          When does he graduate high school?

               GINA
               (laughing)
          Oh, very jealous.

     Joe laughs.

               GINA (CONT'D)
          I saw Lucy when I was in London, she
          seems okay.  It's hard to tell with her.

               JOE
          Shit, I forgot to call her back.  She's
          off on a trip somewhere.  Oh God, my
          grandad's flat in London's been sold.

               GINA
          In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a
          meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry.

               JOE
          I should have damn well bought it.  Well,
          we can't afford it.  The movie's going to
          eat up a year of my life and I'm getting
          paid next to nothing.  Do you know how
          much Skye Davidson's getting?  Four
          million.

               GINA
          Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow
          job.

               JOE
          You really need to be fucked.

     INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

               SALLY
          So how are you really doing, Panes?

               PANES
          Why don't you go fuck yourself?

               SALLY
               (laughs)
          No.  Really.  For real.  Really.

               PANES
          I'm worried about your Galiano.

               SALLY
               (slaps him)
          You're a shit.

               PANES
          No, really, five thousand with your
          discount.

     He rolls out from under her swat, she misses him.

               PANES (CONT'D)
          You hurt, you know.  You're stronger than
          you think.

     They lie prone across the bed, about a foot apart.
     Contemplating the floor.

               PANES (CONT'D)
               (finally)
          How's the movie going?  Your movie.  You
          are making a movie, aren't you?

               SALLY
          Yes.  Fine.

               PANES
          That's it?  Yes.  Fine?

               SALLY
          I don't want to talk about it.

               PANES
          Why not?

               SALLY
          I never like to talk about my work.

               PANES
          Alright.  Well, that's something new.

               SALLY
          No.  Not something new.

               PANES
          Well, something's wrong.

               SALLY
          Nothing's wrong.  It's great, okay?
          Having the time of my life.  Mac's a
          fantastic director.  And what can anyone
          say about Cal that hasn't been said.  And
          it's great working with friends, blah
          blah blah.

               PANES
               (a moment; little smile)
          Um.  Happy for you.

               SALLY
          Thanks.

               PANES
          So tell me, how's it going?

               SALLY
          Oh you know.  No doubts.  No second
          thoughts.  Am I a monster?

               PANES
          You're my best friend.

               SALLY
          That's not an answer, is it?

               PANES
          Yes, you're a monster.

     She takes his hand.  Sounds of the party come from below.

               SALLY
               (a moment)
          Thank you, Panes.

               PANES
          You don't need to thank me.

               SALLY
               (another moment)
          We're going to have to go back out there.

               PANES
          I guess.

     But neither of them moves.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     SANFORD JEWISON is at the piano playing his own stuff,
     oblivious to the din.  The CAMERA gets a glimpse of Ryan
     through the French doors at the pool, alone, a glass of
     Perrier in his hand.

     MEDIUM CLOSE

     Monica alone, uneasy, starts to pour herself a glass of
     champagne.  Jeffrey gets to the bottle first.

               JEFFREY
          Let me.
               (pours for her)
          I'm Jeffrey.

               MONICA
          Monica.

               JEFFREY
          And you know our friends, how?

               MONICA
          We live next door.

               JEFFREY
          Oh.  You're them.

               MONICA
          Excuse me?

               JEFFREY
          We've heard lots about you.

               MONICA
               (lost)
          You have?

     EXT. POOL - CONTINUOUS

     Judy Adams lost herself a little, steps outside, sits
     alone...

               JUDY
               (smiles over at Ryan)
          Hi.

               RYAN
          Hi.  A little close in there.

               JUDY
          Yup.

     INT. MUSIC LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

     A small, narrow room.  Not much more than an alcove.  With
     space for a desk, stereo equipment, and shelves packed with
     CDs.  The topmost shelf is a line of record albums.

     Joe's picking through the CDs.  Monica wanders in from the
     living room, toting a glass of champagne... watches him for a
     moment.

               MONICA
          Your Eames table is incredible.  And the
          B&B.  I just put that in a client's home,
          actually, but in red.

               JOE
          You're an interior decorator, right?

               MONICA
               (nods)
          Sally did all this herself?

               JOE
          In fits and starts -- and then, later, of
          course, she had to accommodate me.  So
          things shifted a little bit then, became
          more eclectic.  And it keeps changing.

               MONICA
               (somehow at a loss)
          Mmm.  It says something about the two of
          you maybe.

               JOE
          Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux.
               (re: champagne)
          I see you've moved up from the soft
          stuff.

               MONICA
          Oh, yes.  You know Ryan's been sober
          eight years.  And it's difficult if I...
          you know.  It's better if I don't.

               JOE
          Uh-huh.

               MONICA
          I'm a little nervous, so...

               JOE
          Oh.

               MONICA
          A little out of my element.

               JOE
          No you're not.

               MONICA
          Well, yes.  Yes, in fact.  A little on
          the outside, yes.  And there's been all
          this friction.

               JOE
          Hm.

               MONICA
          I don't know why, but these
          misunderstandings have a way of
          escalating.

               JOE
          Very well put.

               MONICA
          I think a lot of this could have been
          avoided if Sally made more of an effort.

               JOE
          What?

               MONICA
          But you're very private people.  You
          know, there's a kind of elitism...

               JOE
               (pissed)
          Elitism?

               MONICA
          The wrong word, maybe.  Delete that.
          And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.

               JOE
          And you know, he really does not.

               MONICA
          And Ryan works at home.

               JOE
          And your phone calls are nasty and
          abusive.  And I've come this close to
          suing you for harassment.  And you're
          only here because we're supposed to be
          sucking up to you.

     Her eyes well with tears.

               JOE (CONT'D)
          Oh shit.  I'm sorry.

               MONICA
          Well, that's what Ryan thought.  I was
          more generous, actually.

               JOE
          Oh shit.  I'm sorry.  I'm a total fucking
          maniac.  Delete all that, okay?  I spoke
          for myself, this needn't rub off on my
          wife.  Oh shit.  I get pissy sometimes.
          Much worse than Otis.  Otis doesn't bite.
          It's just, I really love my dog and he
          doesn't really bark a lot.
          We live in a canyon.  We hear dogs
          barking at night, too.  And it's not
          Otis.

     Monica starts to laugh.

               MONICA
          Alright.

     It appears she's consumed more than one glass of champagne.

               JOE
          Easy tiger.

               MONICA
          Alright.  Please don't tell Ryan I'm
          drinking.

               JOE
          Scout's honor.

               MONICA
               (grins)
          I'll be your best friend.

     She feels they've bonded.  She pulls a well-thumbed copy of
     Joe's novel from her purse.

               MONICA (CONT'D)
          Would you sign it for me.
               (digs for a pen)
          I'm sure this is inappropriate.

               JOE
          We're way past inappropriate.

     Monica giggles, presses back the bubble rising in her chest
     and moving toward her throat.  Manages not to burp.

               MONICA
               (as he signs it)
          I'll treasure this.

     He moves towards the doorway, Monica at his heals.

               JOE
          I need to leave you now.

               MONICA
          I will treasure this.

               JOE
               (shouting down the hall)
          Sally!!!!

     INT. DAILIES ROOM - LATER - DAY

     Sally's team prepares clues for charades.  Sally writes them
     down, throws them in a bowler hat.  Her teammates are Panes,
     Sophia, Mac, Ryan, Sanford and Jeffrey.

               SALLY
          Panes?

               PANES
          From Jewish Folk Poetry, a song cycle...

               MAC
          What?

               SALLY
          Trust him.

               PANES
          It's Shostakovich.

     Ryan spots his book on the shelf and pulls it out, delighted.

               SALLY
          Sandy...

               SANFORD
          The Wind Up Bird Chronicle.

          Ryan?

               RYAN
               (pleased)
          I didn't know you had this.

               SALLY
          Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You
          think you could sign it for us?

               RYAN
          Absolutely.  You always wonder where your
          books end up.  Why don't we use it?

               JUDY
          Good idea.

               RYAN
          There's not a chance in hell anyone will
          get it...

               MAC
          Down by Law.

     Joe's team works on it's clues.  Teammates: Gina, Cal, Clair,
     Skye, Monica, Jerry and Mary-Lynn.  Everyone is talking over
     each other and fighting for attention.  There are a lot of
     strong personalities here.

               JOE
          Can we... one at a time?  Hold it down,
          and one at a time.  You're last, Cal.

               CAL
          Why last?

               MONICA
          The Katzenjammer Kids.

     There's a hush.

               MONICA (CONT'D)
          You know.  It's the Funnies.  The
          Katzenjammer Kids.  It's my mother's
          favorite charade's clue.  No one ever
          gets it.

     Pause.

               JOE
          Alright.  Good.  Fine, I vote for that.

     He writes it down.

               MONICA
          With a "Z."  K. A. T. Z.

               GINA
          When the Pawn Hits the Conflicts He
          Thinks Like a King What He Knows...

     People hoot, throw their cocktail napkins.

               GINA (CONT'D)
          What?

               SKYE
          Utopia Parkway...

     They all start talking on top of each other again.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

     The teams have come together.

               JOE
          Who's keeping time?

     Mac raises his hand on Sally's side, Jerry on Joe's.

               JOE (CONT'D)
          Two minutes.

               SALLY
               (deferring first turn to Joe)
          It's alright.  Be our guests.

     She offers the hat.

               JOE
               (offers the hat)
          You darling.

     Panes reaches into the hat.

               PANES
               (reads clue; to Joe)
          What is it?

     Joe whispers to him.

               PANES (CONT'D)
          What's a sign for that?

               JOE
          Come on, Panes...

               JERRY
          Go!

     Panes mimes a belly laugh.

               JEFFREY
          What the hell is that?

               SALLY
          What is it Panes?

     Panes sighs.

               SOPHIA
          Two words.

     He belly laughs.

               JUDY
          Funny.

     A finger to his nose - elongate the word.

               SANFORD
          Funnies?

     Panes does an "ON THE NOSE."  Gets on all fours.  Licks his
     paws.

               RYAN
          The Katzenjammer Kids.

     The team applauds delight.  Panes preens.  Joe's team looks
     over at Monica.

               JERRY
               (already pissed)
          It's only just started.  Great.  The
          husband's on the other fucking team.

     Jerry reaches into the hat.  Looks at the clue.

               MAC
          Go.

               JERRY
          Hey!  Would you?

               MAC
          It was fifteen seconds.

               JERRY
          I don't think so.

               MAC
          Are you always this much fun?

               SALLY
               (a grin)
          Take your time, Jer.

               JERRY
          I'm ready.

     He gives the clue "a song."

               CAL
          Song.

     He gives "cycle."

               GINA
          Cycle.

               CAL
          Two words.  Second word.

     Jerry goes to work on "sounds like" for the word Jewish.
     Strokes beard, thinks, tries "sounds like" again.

               TEAM
          Think.  Pain.

               CAL
               (among others)
          Ponder.

               JERRY
          Come on, folks.

               CAL
          First word.

     Jerry does the sign for the "short word."

               TEAM
          To, the, but, or...

     Jerry shakes his head.  Goes to the third word.

               TEAM (CONT'D)
          Third word.  One syllable.

     Jerry pulls his ear, "sounds like".  Slides his finger
     through the O created by his thumb and forefinger.

               TEAM (CONT'D)
          Fuck...sounds like... Fork.  Flock...

     he does the finger sign again.

               TEAM (CONT'D)
          Fuck.  Folk.

     Jerry gives them "on the nose."

               TEAM (CONT'D)
          Second word.

               MAC
          Thirty seconds.

     Jerry turns, gives them a dirty look.

               JOE
          Jer.  Over here.  Over here.

               TEAM
          Second word.

     He strokes his beard again.

               SKYE
               (blurts out)
          From Jewish Folk Poetry.

     Jerry looks at her, amazed.  She stands, throws hands up in
     triumph, does a little victory circle.

     The CAMERA CUTS through the rest of the game, aggressive,
     competitive, verging on hostile.  Sally is often aching from
     laughter, tears streaming down her face.

               JERRY
          Time.  Hey!  Time.  Judy!  Time you guys.
          Hey!!

               JUDY
               (she's up; turns to him, zeig
                heil's him)
          Ya Vhol.  What are you, a fucking Nazi?

               JERRY
          Well it's fucking time.

                         TIME CUT TO:

     CLOSE SHOT

               JERRY (CONT'D)
               (shouting guesses)
          Walk.  Cripple.  Limp.  Ankle.  Second
          syllable.  Second syllable.  Move on to
          the fucking second syllable.

     Gina giving clues starts to laugh.

               JERRY (CONT'D)
               (sings out)
          The clock is ticking!

     Gina loses it, cracks up.

               MAC
          Time.

                         TIME CUT TO:

     Jeffrey's on his feet, giving the clue.

               SALLY'S TEAM
               (unison)
          Quote.  Play.

               SOPHIA
          Oh shit.  It's one of Cal's.  Obscure
          Shakespeare, folks.

     Cal gives her a little wave from the other side.

               SOPHIA (CONT'D)
               (calls over to him)
          Maybe something original for a change.

     Cal blows her a kiss.

               SALLY'S TEAM
               (in unison)
          Ten...twenty...thirty...seven, eight.
          Thirty-eighth word...thirty-seventh word.

     Gina's been taking shots through the course of the game, and
     the FRAME will freeze black and white on one of another
     delicious moment.  There's a spectacular shot of Sally,
     unaware, laughing, sad soft eyes on Joe.

     MEDIUM CLOSE - AMERICA

     She watches the game from the archway, waits for a break.
     Sky's up.  Joe's team yells frantic guesses.  Jerry's
     suicidal.

     Sally's team watches, self-satisfied, throw barbed asides.

               SALLY
               (to Joe's look; innocence)
          I didn't say a word.

               MAC
          Time!

               JERRY
          What was it?  What the fuck was it?

               SALLY
               (small grin)
          Ryan's novel.

               JERRY
          Ryan's novel?

               JUDY
          Ryan's novel, Jerry.

               AMERICA
               (sings out)
          Dinner!

               SALLY
          Still champions.

               JOE
          Panes is not on your team anymore.

               PANES
          What did I do?

               SALLY
          Panes is not on my team anymore.  I'll
          have Panes if I like.

               AMERICA
          Dinner.

               SALLY
          Dinner.

               JOE
          It's an unfair advantage.

               SALLY
          You've got Cal.  You've got Gina.  You've
          got Skye?  We're the leftovers.

               JOE
          Okay, knock it off.

               SALLY
          Truce?

               JOE
          Truce.

               SALLY
          Dinner.
               (on the move)
          Don't be angry.

               JOE
               (pissed)
          I'm not fucking angry, for God's sake.

          EXT. POOL AREA - MAGIC HOUR

     Evie and Jake run along the side of the house.  Behind the
     glass walls the CAMERA catches adults moving through the
     living room and into the dining room.

     INT. DINING ROOM - MAGIC HOUR

     Most everyone's moved through to the dining room.  The table
     is filled with platters of beautifully prepared food.
     Candles, flowers.

     ASTRID, newly arrived, carrying a miniature furball, of
     questionable breed, is first in line and halfway around the
     table.  She feeds "Anouk" bits from the table enroute.

               ASTRID
               (barely looks up as Sally comes
                into the room)
          So who won?

               SALLY
               (raises her hand)
          A triumph.  When did you get here?

               ASTRID
          Ten, fifteen minutes ago.

               SALLY
          Why didn't you come in?

               ASTRID
          I hate the sight of blood.  You guys
          don't take prisoners.

               SKYE
               (charmed by the bundle in
                Astrid's arm)
          Oh how sweet.

     The furball bares teeth and growls.

               ASTRID
          She's insanely jealous.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - MEDIUM CLOSE ASTRID - NIGHT

     She slips another morsel into Anouk's mouth, murmurs baby
     talk, allows the dog to take a bit of chicken from between
     her teeth.

               CLAIR
          That's revolting, Astrid.

     People sit in small groups, eating dinner, catching up.
     Latecomers, bunch around Joe.  Sam Feckman, an actor also in
     Mac's film, holds forth.

     Panes finds room next to Skye.

               PANES
          Is there space here?

               SKYE
          Yes.

               PANES
          Do you need anything else?

               SKYE
          No, no thanks.

     He sits on the floor along side her.  They eat in silence for
     a moment.

               PANES
               (finally)
          I was impressed.

               SKYE
          Oh?

               PANES
          The charades.

               SKYE
          Thank you.

               PANES
          That was my clue.

               SKYE
          Oh?

               PANES
          The Shostakovich.

               SKYE
          Really??

               PANES
               (does Seller's Indian)
          Oh yes, indeed.  That was my clue, you
          see.

     Skye giggles appreciative response.

               PANES (CONT'D)
               (still Indian)
          So you are well acquainted with this
          Shostackovich, as am I.

     Other arrivals pick their way through bodies and plates.
     Walk over to Sally and kiss her cheek.  Joe and Gina and
     Jeffrey sit off to the side.

               JOE
          I hate the idea of some one else living
          in it.

     Joe pulls Sally to him and wraps his arms around her.

               JOE (CONT'D)
          Sally's never even seen it.  I thought
          we'd raise our kids there.

     Sally held in Joe's arms, smiles.  The cat who ate the
     canary.

               JOE (CONT'D)
          Have I ever told you how Lucy and I
          nearly squashed each other getting into
          the dumb waiter.

               GINA/JEFFREY/SALLY
          Yes./Often./I stopped counting.

               JOE
          The dumb waiter was our...

               GINA
          Escape hatch.

               JOE
               (eyes her)
          Escape hatch.  And Dad was having a go
          about the garden.  Something was
          misplanted...

               SALLY
          Not properly watered.

               JOE
          Whatever!
               (to Gina)
          You know how he gets.  Well, he went
          absolutely bonkers.  Lucy and I were
          frantically trying to scramble into the
          dumb waiter and I didn't fit any more.
          It was almost fatal.  And that, my dear
          friends, is the day...

               SALLY/JEFFREY
          I realized I had become a man.  Ta da!

               GINA
          You're not a man, Joe.  You're a boy.

               JOE
               (childishly)
          So?

               GINA
               (laughs)
          I love you, Joe Therrian.

               SALLY
               (at a loss, small)
          Me too.

     Sophia watches from across the living room.

     NEW ANGLE

     INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

     Astrid squeezes in next to Sally, on her second portion of
     everything.  She allows Anouk to nibble from her plate.

               ASTRID
          You're not upset that I brought the dog?

               SALLY
          Would it make a difference?

               ASTRID
          Anouk isn't like a dog, really.  More
          like a small person.  So is there anyone
          here for me?  No one looks new.
               (fixes on Ryan)
          Who's that?

               SALLY
          You don't want that.  It's married and
          it's the neighbor.

               ASTRID
          Oh I think he's cute.  How's the marriage
          part working out?

               SALLY
          You're fucking desperate.

               ASTRID
          Like you didn't know.
               (re: Skye)
          Who invited the bimbo?

               SALLY
          One guess.

     INT. LIVING ROOM

     The CAMERA stays close on the cake as America wheels the cart
     into the living room.  The top of it sports Sally and Joe's
     faces on either side of Otis, a detailed edible photograph.
     There are three sixes across the top.

     There's a freed up pathway.  Cal taps the side of his
     champagne glass with a fork.

               SOPHIA
               (re: the cake as it comes in)
          Part of our gift.  Honey!!

               CAL
               (clinks his glass)
          Here, here.

     Clair picks up discarded dinner plates.  Otis takes care of
     those behind couches, under tables.

     The gifts are stacked high, near the fireplace.  Sally is on
     the floor, nestled between Joe's knees, leaning back against
     him.  His arms are wrapped around her, face pressed against
     hers.

     There's a SERIES OF CUTS through speeches, gifts,
     entertainment.  Sophia and Cal do a well rehearsed, very
     funny, impromptu something with their kids.

     Panes and Mac do an interpretive dance symbolizing the
     marriage.

     Cal and Sophia carry sleeping children down the hall.

     There are speeches about Sally and Joe, outrageously dirty,
     funny, sometimes touching - that cover their recent
     separation, the custody of Otis, their trying to have a
     baby...

     Panes plays a piece on the violin.  Someone else sings.  And
     finally...

     MEDIUM CLOSE - SKYE

     She looks out at the guests...

     NEW ANGLE

     They look back at her.

               SKYE
          I wasn't prepared to say anything.  I'm
          honored to be a part of tonight.  To be
          in the same room, with my favorite living
          actress...

     The CAMERA barely catches the grimace on Mac's face; Clair
     elbows him.

               SAM
               (sings out)
          Still living.

               SKYE
          And my favorite novelist.  And all their
          amazing --

               SAM
               (sings out)
          And talented.

               SKYE
          Friends.  And talented friends.  This
          room is so filled with love..

               ASTRID
               (sings out)
          And the winner is...

               PANES
          Let the woman speak.

               SKYE
          And I brought a gift of love.  A gift
          that is love.

     She pulls an envelope from behind her back, which she's
     decorated in flower-child fashion; it harkens back to the
     sixties, puts it into Sally's hand, kisses her cheek.

               SKYE (CONT'D)
               (tears up)
          Happy anniversary.  Thank you for making
          me a part of it.

               SALLY
               (pours the pills into her hand)
          What are they?

               JOE
               (pleased, surprised)
          Dolphins.  Great.

               SALLY
          It's ecstasy, Sal.

               SKYE
          I think there are sixteen there.

               JOE
               (kisses Skye)
          This is an amazing present.  What a
          sweetheart you are.

     Skye's pleased she's made him happy.

               SALLY
               (regards Joe; to Skye)
          What a sweetheart you are.

     A pall descends on the party.  There's a FULL SHOT of the
     group.  Nobody quite knows what to do.  There's torn wrapping
     paper all over the room.

               ASTRID
               (Anouk still in her lap)
          It's late.
               (kisses Anouk)
          You sleepy baby?

     There are awkward excuses.  Some of the guests leave.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

     The core group remains.

               JOE
          I think we should all take it tonight.
          Everyone's staying, stays.  No driving.
          That's the rule.  I love you Sally-Mae.
          You're going to have a fabulous time.

               SALLY
          I'm worried about my spine.  I'm very
          worried about my brain and my spine.

               SOPHIA
               (laughs)
          Oh honey, you're gonna love it.

               JOE
               (to her Look)
          Sophia's going to do it, Panes is going
          to do it, trust me.

     INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

     Cal carries the envelope into the room.

               CAL
               (on seeing America, bursts
                into)
          America, America God shed his light on
          me.

     He dances her around the kitchen, he picks up the sterling
     dish, arranges the pills, carries them back to the living
     room.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Ecstasy is passed from guest to guest.  Ryan expects Monica
     to abstain.

               MONICA
               (his glare; simply)
          I want to try it, Ryan.

     EXT. POOL - LATER

     The drug has begun to take effect.  The party is now in full
     swing.  Music is playing, and Sophia and Clair are dancing.

     People are swimming, some naked, some in swimsuits.  Judy
     floats around the pool on an inflatable dog.

     Sally and Skye cuddle together on one of the benches round
     the pool, chatting; a friendly, feely touchy conversation.
     Joe passes around bottles of water and chewing gum to
     everyone, emceeing the event.

     Everyone is relaxed and open, except Ryan, who sits beside
     Monica at the edge of the garden, separated from the others.

               MONICA
          I love it here.  Don't you love it here,
          Ryan?  I love it here.  And I love
          tonight.  And I love these people.  And
          this feels utterly fantastic, Ryan.
               (touches her own cheek, ever so
                lightly; shivers against the
                sensation)
          Utterly fantastic.

               RYAN
          You know what Sally Therrian was saying
          about your spine and your brain?  She
          didn't pull that out of thin air.  It
          causes brain damage.  You'd better drink
          a lot of water.

               MONICA
          Do you want to go home, Ryan?

               RYAN
          Yes.

               MONICA
          I think you should then.  You should look
          in on Sheila.

               RYAN
          I'm not going to leave you alone.

               MONICA
          They're really nice people, Ryan.
          They're like us...

               RYAN
          They're nothing like us.

               MONICA
          I think you need to speak for yourself,
          Ryan.  But I think you're really nice
          people...

     She puts arms around him, kisses his cheek.  He stiffens.

               RYAN
          Are you making an ass of yourself?

               MONICA
          There's only you, Ryan.  You know what,
          Ryan?  You're beautiful.  I love you so
          much... You need...

               RYAN
          I don't need a drug.

               MONICA
          You need a good review and you'll be
          fine.  The whole color of the world will
          change, mark my words.

     She gets up.

               RYAN
          Ready to go?

               MONICA
          I'm going to go get my swimsuit.  I do
          know, Ryan, this is non addictive so you
          mustn't worry.
               (turns back)
          Ryan, you're a great man.

     The CAMERA follows Monica along the side of the pool.  She
     passes Sophia and a very exuberant Clair.

     The CAMERA stays at the pool.  Clair tears off Sally's
     Galiano, flings it to the ground and dives topless into the
     pool.

               CLAIR
          This water is great!

               JERRY
               (swimming past her)
          Wanna dive for a baton?

     MEDIUM CLOSE UP - JUDY

     She stands at the side of the pool.

               JUDY
          Okay, I'm about to throw five colored
          batons in the water.  Then I'm going to
          count to three, and then you may start
          diving.  I'm playing too.  The red one is
          ten extra points.  Ready?
               (she throws batons in)
          One, two, three, go!!

     There is a melee of diving and screaming.

                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. BACKYARD LANDING

     It's at the end of a bridge, overlooking the pool.  Voices
     drift up from below.  Mac and Joe walk in circles pacing
     around one another.

               MAC
          You got your DP?

               JOE
          What?  Oh yeah, the camera man?  They
          gave me a list.

               MAC
          And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big
          leagues for a first timer.  Do you even
          like movies?

               JOE
          Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God
          I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet,
          Mac?

               MAC
          Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver
          Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're
          friends.  And great DP's I could give
          them a call for you.

               JOE
          Thanks, Mac.
               (regards him)
          And thanks for being so supportive about
          all this.
               (throws arm around him, hugs
                him close)
          I really love you, you know.

               MAC
          Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy.  Anything
          I can do.

               JOE
               (lets go of Mac)
          God, I really need to jump about a bit.
               (begins jumping)
          How's your film going?

               CAL
          It's going.  It's going.

               JOE
          And how's the diva doing?

               MAC
          Well, you know...good days, bad days.

               JOE
          I meant Sally.

               MAC
          I meant Sally.

               JOE
               (stops jumping, studies him)
          Oh.  You're serious.

               MAC
               (throws and arm around him)
          No.  No.
               (a beat)
          Let me tell you something.  Directing's
          the best preparation possible for
          fatherhood.  The sleep depravation alone.

               JOE
          Oh don't.  Everyone says that.

     INT. MUSIC LIBRARY

     Sally's taken Gina's photograph of them from the mantelpiece
     in the living room, and looks for a spot for it on the CD
     shelves.  Sophia is studying the CDs very intently.  They are
     both bopping to the music.

               SALLY
               (re: the photograph)
          Isn't this a fabulous picture?

               SOPHIA
          Yes.

               SALLY
          She's such a great photographer.

               SOPHIA
          Hm.

               SALLY
          So where should I put it?

               SOPHIA
          I thought it was okay where it was.

               SALLY
          It's much more personal in here.

               SOPHIA
          A notch above the storage room.

               SALLY
          We're always in here.
               (regards the photo)
          She really gets him, doesn't she?

               SOPHIA
          The both of you.

               SALLY
          But she really gets to the heart of Joe,
          doesn't she?  She's a genius.

               SOPHIA
          So how much do you hate her?

               SALLY
          Big time.

     They both laugh, then...

               SOPHIA
          Well, I don't trust her.  I never have.

               SALLY
          She took our wedding photos, for
          chrissakes.  You don't trust anyone.

               SOPHIA
               (a moment simply)
          I trust you.

               SALLY
          Oh Soph...

               SOPHIA
          You'll hate it in London.  It's wet and
          miserable.  A medical hellhole Sally.
          It's socialized.  Beds in the corridors.
          Terrible plumbing.

               SALLY
          And the food sucks, I know.

               SOPHIA
          You are not having your baby in London.
          You're going to have your baby at Cedars
          in Beverly Hills, America, delivered by
          Dr. Milton Cohen.  Period.
          And you're getting that epidural right
          away, don't let anyone talk you into any
          of that Lamase bullshit.  There's no
          excuse for pain like that.

               SALLY
          Sophia!  I'm not even pregnant!

               SOPHIA
          Well good.  Thank God.

               SALLY
          Let's go in the kitchen and spy on
          everyone.

               SOPHIA
          Oh honey, let's.

     They've started to walk through the house.

               SALLY
               (stops short; turns to her)
          What do you mean, thank God?

               SOPHIA
          Well, are you sure about this baby thing?
          It's not the ticking clock shit, is it?

               SALLY
          No, no, not at all... I mean I've still
          got plenty of time.  Don't I?  I mean I
          still have a good six years, whatever.
          We could have three kids yet, if we
          wanted.  And I know I've always said I
          never wanted kids, and I didn't... but
          this year, I really, truly, feel ready...

               SOPHIA
          Honey, I'm not worried about you.  You
          are going to be a fantastic mom.  Not an
          issue.  I pressed you, remember?  Joe, on
          the other hand, is a different story.

               SALLY
               (laughs)
          Oh Soph, Joe loves kids.  Joe wants kids.
          Joe thinks he needs kids.

               SOPHIA
          He wants playmates.  Oh he's a
          sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him.
          But he's not going to be a good father.
          He's just not parenting material.

               SALLY
          Hey, let's sit down.  I bet the rug feels
          really nice against your skin.

     Sally drops out of frame.

               SOPHIA
          Don't try and change the subject.
               (sitting, joining Sally)
          Oh God, it feels great!  He's just a
          little narcissistic, irresponsible and
          unreliable.

               SALLY
          And Cal's this massive adult?

               SOPHIA
          Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how
          happy Joe was when the drugs came out
          tonight?

               SALLY
          You weren't exactly horrified.

               SOPHIA
               (laughing)
          I don't have a drug problem.

               SALLY
          Neither does Joe.

               SOPHIA
          His sister does.  Big time.  And the New
          York Times says addiction is genetic --
          I'll e-mail you the article.

     Sally stares at her friend suddenly mute, eyes wide.

               SOPHIA (CONT'D)
          You don't have kids to keep a marriage
          together, Sally.  It's only five months
          since Joe came back.

               SALLY
               (getting up)
          We're fine.  We're great.  We're having a
          baby and we're moving to London.

               SOPHIA
               (following her)
          Well, you weren't fine last summer when
          you went Sylvia Plath on me in
          Connecticut.

               SALLY
          Not nice.  Not kind.

               SOPHIA
          Ha!  Not half so not kind as your husband
          was in his portrayal of you in his novel.

               SALLY
          Why are you doing this?

               SOPHIA
          His image of you is a possessive, fragile
          neurotic.

               SALLY
               (tearing up)
          But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.

               SOPHIA
               (also tearing up)
          No you are not.  You're Sally Nash.
          Listen to me, you're Sally Nash.  You're
          my best friend and I love you more than
          anyone, and you're not going to move to
          London to have the offspring of a
          sexually ambivalent man-child.  "Oh now
          I'm a novelist, oh now I'm a director..."
          English prick bastard Joe Therrian who's
          probably going to leave you for Skye
          Davidson anyway.

     They hug a bit weepy.

               SOPHIA (CONT'D)
          He's always one step removed, always
          looking over his shoulder always looking
          for something else, something more
          intoxicating, and I don't mean drugs.  I
          love him, Sal, but he's a child.  He's
          not ready.
               (a choked sob, tears well and
                fall)
          Oh God, you're so lucky you don't have
          kids.  You can't stick your head in the
          oven.  You can't take a handful of
          Percoden if you want to, or slit your
          wrists.  You can't do yourself in.  Kids
          rob you of that option.  Trust me.
               (a beat)
          Oh my God, this ecstacy must be really
          good.

     EXT. POOL SIDE - CONTINUOUS

     Joe and Cal sit by the edge of the pool watching Skye dance
     by herself at the far end.  Joe has his hand on Cal's chest.
     Cal is stroking Joe's hair.

               JOE
          Isn't Skye amazing?

               CAL
          She's got great tits.

               JOE
          She's a constant surprise.

               CAL
          And you've only just met.

               JOE
          Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty
          seven and...
               (taps his head)
          The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew
          that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice?

               CAL
          Absolutely.  And she's got great tits.

               JOE
          Yeah, God she really does have great
          tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work
          with her.

               CAL
          The camera loves her.  A great actress.

               JOE
          With great tits.  I'm going to ask her if
          I can touch them.

     He gets up to go towards Skye, is stopped by...

     EXT. MEDIUM SHOT - CLAIR

     Clair is climbing up the pool steps.

               CLAIR
          Has anyone seen Mac?

               JOE
               (pointing further up the
                property)
          I saw him wandering over there, I think.
          How're you feeling, Clair?

               CLAIR
          I'm so good.

     She kisses Joe and Cal, and goes off to find her husband.

               CAL
          Poor Mac.  It's been a bit of a struggle.
          I'm sure Sally's told you.

               JOE
          No, what?

               CAL
          The movie.

               JOE
          Oh, she's really enjoying it.  I think.
          Is Mac okay?

               CAL
          I don't know what's going on.  I don't
          care to guess.  Mac's really unhappy.
          She isn't there, that's all.  She's no
          idea what she's playing, not a clue.

               JOE
          Who, Sally?

               CAL
          And, you know it isn't rocket science,
          this script.  She can barely get the
          lines out.  There was a scene last week -
          she sobbed, through every take.  I know
          crying's easy for her but it's a fucking
          comedy, Joe.  Something's gone.  You
          know, that thing that was Sally - that
          always surprised you.  It's gone.  I
          think she's scared.  And that's death.

               JOE
          I still think she sails above the rest.
          I mean not like her early films.  But
          those were all such great directors.

               CAL
          Mac's a pretty great director, Joe.  He's
          a woman's director.  And nothing's
          happening.  Course he won't fire her,
          because of the friendship... But it was
          discussed.  He had to battle his studio
          to get her in the first place.

               JOE
          What?

               CAL
          Hey, listen, I love her.  She's Sophia's
          best friend.
               (to Joe's stare)
          I never said any of this, alright.  I'll
          deny it on the stand...
               (into the silence)
          You guys are gonna have kids.  That is so
          great.  Maybe that's what this is all
          about.  Maybe she doesn't want to do this
          anymore.  You know adults don't do this
          for a living.  You guys are gonna have
          your kids, you'll be directing -- one
          asshole in the family is enough.  Sophia
          knew that intuitively.  Look at Clair.
          Clair's a mess.
               (throws an arm around him)
          Make sure she gets the epidural.  Forget
          that natural childbirth shit.
          Everything's going to be what it's
          supposed to be.  "Life is but a walking
          shadow.  A poor player who struts and
          frets his hour upon the stage and then is
          heard no more..." And speaking of me, the
          role of Leo in your film?

               JOE
               (stares at him)
          Leo?

               CAL
          Any thoughts on casting yet?

               JOE
               (regards him)
          Leo?  It was out to Jude Law.  Jude
          passed.

               CAL
          Well, I can't make any promises, and of
          course I haven't read the script but I
          loved the novel...when are you shooting?

               JOE
          October-ish.

               CAL
          I have a small window of time.

               JOE
          Leo.  Leo's twenty-eight, Cal.

               CAL
          Scratch the two, write in a four.

               JOE
          Scratch the two, write in a four.

               CAL
          You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty
          nine.

               JOE
          Five years ago, I was at the party,
          remember?

     Joe looks up and sees Sally standing in the sun room.  He
     blows her a kiss.  She kisses her finger tips and puts her
     hand flat against the window pane.

     INT. BEDROOM CLOSET - TIGHT CLOSE - SALLY

     She's in her wardrobe pacing back and forth a bit frantic.
     Trying on clothing, tossing garments to the ground.  The
     floor is a heap of discarded ideas.  She pulls on jeans and a
     t-shirt.  Very similar to what Skye is wearing.  She sits a
     moment on the floor.  The sounds of the party below are
     muted.

               SALLY (O.S.)
          Oh Warren, that was awful, I can't sing.

     The CAMERA stays with Sally as she gets to her feet, walks
     along the corridor, toward the sound of her voice.

     INT. DAILIES ROOM - NIGHT

     Mac is on the edge of the couch, elbows on knees, staring at
     the television screen - watching his dailies.  At some point
     he drops his head.  Stops watching...

     INT. MOVIE SET

               CAL'S VOICE FROM THE T.V. (O.S.)
          You sing like a bird.

               SALLY'S VOICE FROM THE T.V. (O.S.)
          A bird with dropsy.  A caged bird.  That
          hasn't long to live.

               CAL'S VOICE FROM THE T.V. (O.S)
          You seem so alive up there.

     Sally stands at the open door.  Stunned.  Watches Mac watch
     her.  Watches herself, with a professional, acute eye.  More
     critical than Mac's could ever be.

               SALLY (ON TV)
          I was faking it.  I've been feeling caged
          for sometime.  Funny, huh?

               MAC
               (moans)
          No, it's not... Fuck fuck fuck fuck.

     INT. CORRIDOR - CLOSE SHOT - SALLY

     She backs up into the corridor mortified.  Leans against the
     wall.

               CAL'S VOICE FROM THE T.V. (O.S.)
          It's preposterous.  You're free to do
          whatever you like.

               SALLY'S VOICE FROM THE T.V.
          Yes, well, we'll see won't we?

               MAC (O.S.)
          Jesus Christ.

               SALLY
               (a deep breath)
          Well...wow...

     INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

     Clair's started down the hallway, reaches the landing.  Sally
     rushes into the guest bedroom to avoid her.  Clair, just
     missing Sally, wanders into the dailies room.

     INT. DAILIES ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               CLAIR
          Mac?  Oh there you are.  What are you
          doing, honey?  No more work.  Don't you
          feel breezy.

               MAC
          I'm in mourning.

               CLAIR
          You can cut around it, whatever it is.
          You always do.

               MAC
          Not this time.

               CLAIR
          It's always not this time.  If you can do
          it around me, you can do it around
          anyone.

     She walks in front of the television set, blocks it with her
     body, switches it off.

               MAC
               (an observation)
          You don't have any clothes on.

               CLAIR
          How nice for everybody.  Come swimming.
          The water's glorious.
               (re: the film)
          You'll fix it.  You'll come up with one
          of your brilliant ideas.

               MAC
          Or I won't.  I can't help her.  I'm out
          of my depth.

               CLAIR
          Things always look much worse in the
          morning.

               MAC
          I don't know how to make her funny.

               CLAIR
          You're coming swimming in the pool, and
          in a few minutes you won't even remember
          what it's about.  You won't care who's in
          your damn movie.

               MAC
               (really stoned)
          What what's about?

               CLAIR
          I...wait, what are you talking about?

     INT. GUEST ROOM

     MEDIUM CLOSE

     Jack and Evie are asleep across the bed.

     NEW ANGLE

     Sally sits at the edge of the bed, regards the sleeping
     children.  Reaches over and smoothens the tangled, tousled
     hair.  Studies their faces.

     EXT. POOLSIDE - JOE'S POV

     Monica sits on the steps of the pool.  She looks frightened,
     uncomfortable.

               JOE
          Are you okay?

               MONICA
          I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit
          funny.

               JOE
          Let's go for a walk.

     He puts his arm around her and leads her away from the pool.

     EXT. BACKYARD LANDING - NIGHT

               MONICA
          I've never done this before.

               JOE
          Oh?  It's easy.  You just put one foot in
          front of the other... That's a good girl.

               MONICA
          I'm a little in the puke zone.

               JOE
               (giving her some water)
          Here, drink this.  Drink lots of water.
               (puts the bottle in her hand)
          Hold on to this.  Take deep breaths.
          Nice and slow.
               (sits her down; produces a
                lollipop)
          Would you like a lolly?

               MONICA
          What am I, five?

               JOE
          You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm
          having one.

               MONICA
               (a grin)
          Okay.

     He pulls out another one.

               JOE
          Lemon or raspberry?

               MONICA
          Lemon.

               JOE
          Lemon it is.

     The two suck on their lollipops for a moment.

               MONICA
               (finally)
          Ryan's really angry with me.

               JOE
          I think he's really angry with me too.

               MONICA
               (laughs)
          It's really not the same thing.
               (a moment)
          He was really nicer when he drank.

               JOE
          I'm sorry.

               MONICA
          Eight years, though.  That's quite an
          accomplishment.

               JOE
          That's a lot of those.

               MONICA
          Medallions.

               JOE
          A lot of cakes.

               MONICA
          Yes.

               JOE
          And he doesn't smoke?

               MONICA
          He has to find non-smoker's meetings that
          used to be almost impossible, you know?
          It's gotten much better.

               JOE
          How long have you been married?

               MONICA
          Nine...nine, yes?  Nine years, just
          about.

               JOE
          You must have been a baby.

               MONICA
          Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.
               (a moment)
          I'm cold.

               JOE
          Come here.

     Joe holds Monica.

               MONICA
               (a moment)
          That's very nice.

               JOE
          I like you.

               MONICA
          I'm so glad.  You know, I recognize that
          passage in your book.  The bit about us
          running into each other in the movie
          theatre.

               JOE
          Sorry?

               MONICA
          I know you changed it to a bookstore.
          And the color of my hair.  But the moment
          was exactly the same.  The same, you
          know, dynamic.  And almost verbatim,
          wasn't it?

               JOE
               (humors her)
          Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's
          sacred.
               (thinks a moment)
          No, nothing at all.

               MONICA
          I think it's great that I made an
          impression at all, you know.

     Joe regards the open trusting face, is touched by it.  Leans
     in, kisses her lips very lightly... and again.  Her arms
     can't make up her mind, whether to come up around him or not.
     Finally do.

               SALLY (O.S.)
          Otis!!  Otis, come!  Oh fuck!

     She appears beside them.

               SALLY (CONT'D)
          Someone left the goddamn gate open.  Otis
          got out.  Skye and I, well the... I came
          out of the house and the fucking gate was
          wide open.

               JOE
          Oh for fuck's sake.  Nobody uses that
          gate.

               MONICA
               (horrified)
          I'm sorry.

               SALLY
               (raging)
          There's a goddamn sign on the gate.

               MONICA
          I'm so sorry.

               SALLY
          You fucking cow, can't you read?!

               MONICA
               (at a loss)
          I...

               SALLY
          How long ago was it?

               JOE
          Stop being such a bitch, Sal.

               MONICA
          I'm so sorry.

               JOE
          It was a mistake.  This isn't a plot to
          do in Otis.

               SALLY
          Don't be so sure.

               JOE
          Listen to yourself...
               (to Monica)
          Don't worry, it's alright.  We'll find
          him.
               (to Sally)
          What's wrong with you?

               SALLY
               (re: Monica)
          She left the fucking gate open.

               JOE
          Well he can't have gone far.

               SALLY
          Can't have gone far?  He's like a
          greyhound.  He could be miles away.

               JOE
          He'll find his way back.

               SALLY
          There are fucking coyotes out there.

               JOE
               (calming)
          Sally, calm down.  We're not going to
          find him any quicker by you being
          hysterical.

     Monica retreats, backs off a step or two.

               SALLY
          Fuck you.

               JOE
          Or shitty!!  Otis!!

                                 CUT TO:

     INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

     America and Rosa are cleaning up.  Ryan hangs around
     chatting.

               RYAN
          How long have you worked for the
          Therrians?

               AMERICA
               (shrugs, polite but annoyed)
          A long time.

               RYAN
          So you were here when they were doing the
          work on the boundary fence?

               AMERICA
          Oh yes.

               RYAN
          Did you know the contractor?

               AMERICA
          Very well.

               RYAN
          Was it a contractor?

               AMERICA
          It's the way they do things.

               RYAN
          To code?

     Her back is to him.  She exchanges a glance with Rosa, and
     the Spanish equivalent of "who is this wanker?"

               RYAN (CONT'D)
          Did you see permits?  Did he have a
          license?

               AMERICA
          You should talk to Mr. Joe.

     Monica bursts into the room.

               MONICA
          Ryan, you've got to come!  You've got to
          help me find the dog!  I let their dog
          out.  We need to find the dog.

               RYAN
          You're not serious.

               MONICA
          I left the gate open and Otis got out!
          He could get hit by a car!

               RYAN
          God willing.

               MONICA
          We have to find the dog, Ryan.

               RYAN
          Why?

               MONICA
               (regards him)
          Because we're nice people, and because
          what goes around comes around.
               (desperate)
          Because, God help you if something
          happens to that dog?

               RYAN
          Excuse me?

               MONICA
          All the ugly phone calls?  We're not the
          only people with a tape recorder, Ryan.
               (a beat)
          They've gone to the canyon, we should go
          towards the PCH.

     EXT. CANYON - MOMENTS LATER

     Panes and Skye search the canyon for Otis.  They both carry
     lanterns.

               PANES
          Otis!!  Shostakovich identified with the
          Jew.  He felt persecuted, hunted, crushed
          under the thumb of Stalinist imperialism.

               SKYE
          Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis,
          come!!

               PANES
          Andre Zhdanov?  How the hell do you know
          about Andre Zhdanov?

               SKYE
          Who doesn't know about the infamous
          composer's conference of 1948 where
          Zhdanov persecuted the leaders of Soviet
          Music - Shostakovich, Prokofieve, and
          Myaskovsky.

               PANES
          I'll tell you who doesn't know, cute
          girls don't know.

               SKYE
          Do Peter Sellers again.

               PANES
               (a la Sellers)
          Otis you crazy dog!  Otis are you in this
          God forsaken Canyon?  My people are very
          hungry.

               SKYE
          I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I
          played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who
          gets shot in the head, and they used
          Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.

               PANES
          Set to the poem of Yetveshenko!

               SKYE
          Exactly!  So I dug it, and I did a lot of
          research.

               PANES
          Do you really, you really, like
          Shostakovich?

               SKYE
          Yeah.

               PANES
          Would you, like, marry him?

               SKYE
          If he were still alive, maybe.

               PANES
          How about someone who really really liked
          Shostakovich?

               SKYE
               (smiling)
          Are you asking me to marry you?

               PANES
          No, I'm just testing to see how deeply
          perverted and impulsive you are.

               SKYE
               (laughing)
          Very.

               PANES
          Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really
          twenty-two?

               SKYE
          Who told you that?  No.  I'm twenty...
               (lops off two years)
          Five.

     EXT. CANYON - CONTINUOUS

     Sally and Joe have lanterns.  Panes and Skye are up ahead.
     We hear them calling for Otis.

               SALLY
          Otis!!!!

               JOE
               (on her heels)
          Otis!!!!

               SALLY
          Otis, good boy, come here.  Oh my god, oh
          my god, oh my god.

               JOE
          This is a nightmare.  We should have kept
          him upstairs.

               SALLY
          It was done.  When Sophia put the kids to
          bed, America brought Otis in the room and
          closed the door.  It was done.

               JOE
          Well someone clearly let him out before
          Monica opened the gate.

               SALLY
          Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're
          at it.  But I guess that's what I
          interrupted.

               JOE
          Jesus, Sally.  You are a medical miracle.
          The only person who's ever taken ecstacy
          and become angrier.

               SALLY
          Yeah, let's talk about that.  You seem to
          be rather an expert.  I don't remember in
          the last five months of counselling your
          ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage
          parties.

               JOE
          Rave parties?!  That's so typical - you
          would think it was called rage.  Perfect!

               SALLY
          What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's
          get really clear here.

               JOE
          Sally, so I took a few pills.  I went out
          dancing.  I tried to forget how upset I
          was about splitting up with you.  I
          haven't lied to you.  I told you about
          the people I've slept with.  I just
          didn't mention the few occasions I took
          drugs because you're so fucking
          judgmental I knew I'd never hear the end
          of it, and you have so little faith and
          so little trust in me.  Sally, we're
          back, I love you.  Trust that.  Please
          let's not do this.

               SALLY
          Otis!  Come!  Good boy!  Come!

               JOE
          Otis!

               SALLY
          I'm not sure we understand that word in
          the same way.

               JOE
          Love?

               SALLY
          You walked out on a five year marriage.

               JOE
          That hasn't the first fucking thing to do
          with love.  It's whether we can live
          together... like this!  All the time.

               SALLY
          It's not like this all the time.

               JOE
          DO I want anyone else?  No.  Do I want to
          be with you for the rest of my natural
          life?  I'm trying.

               SALLY
          And how hard it hit?

               JOE
          Just stop right there, Sally.  We've been
          through this.

               SALLY
          You've been through it.  That's how you
          love people.  When it's easy for you,
          when it's convenient for you.

               JOE
          Sally, first of all, you're talking
          bullshit.  And second...

               SALLY
          You want to talk about bullshit?  Lucy
          called you three times this week.  She's
          a fucking mess, Joe.  Your sister is a
          fucking mess.  She needs you.  I talk to
          her more than you do.

               JOE
          That is not true.

               SALLY
          It is true.  You know how you love, Joe?
          You dedicate a book to someone.

               JOE
          Every novel I've had published in every
          language I've dedicated to Lucy.

               SALLY
          Right.  And when was the last time you
          spoke to her?

     Joe is silent.

               SALLY (CONT'D)
          And how fucking dare you cast Skye
          Davidson in that part?  Have you any idea
          how humiliating that is for me?  I'm an
          actress!  It's about our marriage for
          fuck's sake.  Everybody knows that...

               JOE
          It's a novel.

               SALLY
          About me!

               JOE
          Who the fuck do you think you are?  The
          part of Genna is not just about you.
          It's about every woman I've ever loved in
          my entire life.  Including my mother.
          The character is also clearly in her
          early twenties, Sally.

               SALLY
          What are you saying?

               JOE
          Hello?  Last birthday was?

               SALLY
          I don't look my age, Joe.

               JOE
          Sally, I have never considered you for
          this part because you are too old to play
          it.  And you are out of touch with
          reality if you think differently.

               SALLY
          It's a shit novel anyway.

               JOE
          Well there you go.  I let you off the
          hook.  You're one goddamn lucky actress.

               SALLY
          Not really.  I mean your books have
          always been pop, but this is the
          shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all
          our friends think, anyway.

               JOE
          Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle,
          stripped ten years off your face, still
          couldn't have got the thing made.
          Because I don't mean anything as a
          director, and your name doesn't mean fuck
          all anymore.  And the people that can
          hire you are afraid to, because they
          think you're phoning it in.  That you
          don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.

               SALLY
          Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?

               JOE
          Your director and your co-star of your
          current movie.  Don't dish if you can't
          take it, Sally.

               SALLY
          Mac?  Mac says it?  Cal?

     Joe doesn't respond.

               SALLY (CONT'D)
          Cal, too?

               JOE
          Sally, for Christ's sake.

               SALLY
          Anyone else?

               JOE
          This is insanity.
               (moves toward her)
          Sally...

               SALLY
          Don't.

               JOE
          Don't push me away.

               SALLY
          I had an abortion two weeks ago.

               JOE
          Don't do this.

               SALLY
          I found out I was pregnant and it scared
          the shit out of me.

               JOE
               (threatens)
          Don't do this!

               SALLY
          I told you when we met I never wanted
          children.  I don't want kids in my life.
          We talked about it.  You weren't
          listening.

               JOE
          You changed your mind.

               SALLY
          I wanted you back.

     Joe slaps her hard across the face.

               SALLY (CONT'D)
          You think this was to hurt you?!  My God,
          Joe.  It isn't about you.

               JOE
          What?!  You aborted our child?!

               SALLY
          I'm a monster.  Exactly.

               JOE
          You're not ready.

               SALLY
          Don't make allowances.  I'll never be
          ready.  Some people just shouldn't have
          children.  I'd be a terrible fucking
          mother, Joe.  I did want it for us.  But
          I couldn't do it.  I don't really think I
          can do it.

               JOE
          I wasn't part of that picture at all, was
          I?  I wasn't part of that decision.  Did
          I occur to you at all?  It's a fucking
          farce.  It's a fucking farce.  How long
          did you think you could keep it going.
          You're amazing.  Do you have any idea
          what you've done to us?

               SALLY
          Yes.

               JOE
          I'll never forgive you.

               SALLY
          I know.

               JOE
          I have no idea who you are.

     They stand their in silence.  Joe is devastated.  We hear
     Skye and Panes up ahead calling for Otis.

     INT. POOL - CONTINUOUS

     SILENT UNDERWATER SHOTS

     Of Mac, Judy and Clair.  Mac directs an underwater ballet, a
     la Esther Williams.

     There's a sequence of TIGHT OVERLAPPING SHOTS of Mac,
     smiling, swimming underwater.  His image of himself... SLO-MO
     compounded by water-weight.

     The drug has clearly taken effect.  Mac opens his mouth to
     direct his actors, forgets where he is, begins to choke, and
     cough, is clearly in trouble.

     Oblivious, Judy and Clair turn somersaults.

     Mac begins to panic.  He is drowning.

     He begins to sink.  Panic gives way to acceptance.

     Jerry's body flies past FRAME, splashes hard into the pool.
     The LENS is water-splattered.

     MEDIUM-CLOSE SHOT UNDERWATER

     Jerry's body sweeps past the lens, smooth and sleek as a
     Dolphin.  He grabs Mac...

     EXT. POOL - CONTINUOUS

     Jerry pulls Mac to the surface.  Clair and Judy are out of
     the pool.  Jerry drags the limp body from the pool, pumps
     Mac's chest - it's clear he knows what he's doing.  Mac
     coughs up a load of water.

               CLAIR
          Oh my God.  Honey???

     There's a moment.  Mac begins to sob.

               JERRY
          He's okay, Clair.  You wanna give him a
          little room?

               MAC
               (his face against concrete)
          Man, I must really be stoned.
               (wipes tears from his face with
                his hand)
          Thanks, buddy.

               CLAIR
          Honey?

     Mac raises his hand, arrests her from coming nearer.

               MAC
          I'm fine, babe.

               JERRY
          Give him a minute, Clair.

               MAC
               (humiliated)
          Hey.
               (looks over at Jerry)
          Thanks, buddy.

               JERRY
          Anytime, sport.

               MAC
               (wants to say "don't call me
                sport")
          Yeah, thanks pal.

               CLAIR
               (helpless)
          Honey?

     They all stand around watching him.  Mac gets up.

               MAC
          I'm fine, babe.  I'm gonna take a little
          walk.  I need a minute.  Let's forget it.
          My life didn't pass in front of my eyes.
          So, it probably wasn't that close.

               JERRY
          Probably not.

               MAC
               (to Jerry)
          So, you've got lifeguard papers, or what?

               JUDY
          There's a test, you know.

               JERRY
               (embarrassed)
          Forget it, Judy.

               CLAIR
               (still scared)
          Honey?

               MAC
          I'll be fine.  Really babe.  Give me a
          minute.

     The CAMERA stays on Mac as he walks around the side of the
     house, down the steps through the basement.

     INT. BASEMENT - MEDIUM FULL SHOT

     Mac begins to tremble, sob convulsively.  He bites down on
     his lip, clinches his first, tries to pull himself together.

               MAC
               (paces; at himself)
          You're okay.  Buck up.  Come on, be a
          man.  It could happen to anybody.
               (tears start again)
          If you don't stop, I'm going to punch
          your face in.
               (another moment)

     He pulls a towel off a stack and they all fall on the floor.

               MAC (CONT'D)
          Oh shit.  I can't fucking do anything
          right.  Come on, come on.  Oh thank you
          God for giving me this chance.  Thank you
          for having Jerry here to save me.  I
          promise I will never cheat on my wife
          again.  I will never take drugs again,
          and I will be a great fucking husband and
          a loving father.  I am a great father!  I
          have terrific friends.  I am a brilliant
          director.  Well-respected.  I won a
          Golden Globe, how 'bout that?  Yeah, man,
          it's alright, it's alright, it's alright.
          And God, I will be humble.

     INT. MUSIC LIBRARY - MEDIUM FULL SHOT

     Gina regards the photographs she brought for Joe and Sally.
     She lifts it from the shelf, the phone rings, the machine
     picks up.

               MAN'S VOICE
          Joe, Joe!  It's your Dad!  Pick up,
          Joe...

     Gina sets the photo on the desk, leans it up against the
     wall.  Joe and Sally's faces stare out of it.

               GINA
               (picks up receiver)
          Harry, hi, it's Gina!  Gina.  Is
          everything alright?
               (a deep intake of breath)
          Oh my God.  When?  He's not here.
          They're out looking for Otis.  The dog,
          Harry.
               (tears start down her face)
          I love you so much.  Lucy's a fighter,
          she'll make it.  Whether she wants to or
          not.  Harry.  I'm so sorry.  I will.
               (writes down the number)
          Yes I will.  Take care, Harry.  Bye.

     She puts down the phone.  Stares into Joe's face, looks up at
     a photo on the wall that she took of Joe and Lucy.

     EXT. BACKYARD LANDING

     Jerry and Judy are making out.

               JUDY
          Are you my big brave boy?  Are you my
          brave hero?

               JERRY
          You're crazy baby.  I love you.

               JUDY
          Are you my big hard hero?

               JERRY
          Do you want me to save you?  Do you want
          me to save you?

               JUDY
          Oh yeah...

               JERRY
          Oh yeah... I'm gonna save you.

               JUDY
          Oh yeah?

               JERRY
          Let me heal you, baby.

               JUDY
               (mantra)
          Oh Jesus oh Jesus oh Jesus.

     Grunts, groans, a scream, a peel of giggles.

               JERRY
          Oh yeah.

     INT. MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Gina pulls Joe's clothes out of the closet, out of the
     drawers.  There's an overnight bag on the bed.

     EXT. POOL AREA

     Cal and Sophia lie cuddled on a lounge chair, blissed out,
     counting the windows of the house.

               SOPHIA
          ...no, no, start again.

               CAL AND SOPHIA
          One, two, three, four...

     Clair wanders up.  She's changed into her own clothes.

               CLAIR
          I've lost my husband and my beeper.  Have
          either of you seen either of them?

     INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

     Clair, Mac, Sophia, Cal and Gina are waiting.  The overnight
     bag rests near the coffee table.  No one speaks.

     There are sounds of the search party approaching.

     NEW ANGLE

     Panes, Skye, Sally and Joe come into the room dogless.

               JOE
          What is it?

               GINA
          Let's go upstairs, okay?

     Joe looks from Gina to the others.

               GINA (CONT'D)
          Let's go upstairs.

     They move out of the room.

               SALLY
               (on the way upstairs)
          Is it Otis?

     Skye and Panes look at the other guests.

               SKYE
          What happened?

     INT. MASTER BEDROOM

     Gina closes the door.

               JOE
          The suspense is killing me.

               GINA
          Harry called.

               JOE
               (growing dread)
          And?

               GINA
               (there's now way to say it)
          Lucy overdosed.

               JOE
               (a long moment)
          But she's alright.

               GINA
          She's in ICU.

     Joe's legs give way.  He sort of sits on the floor.

               JOE
               (laughs; shakes his head)
          Stupid tart.

               GINA
          She left a note.

               JOE
               (realizes the import; to Gina)
          Fuck you.

     Tears start down Sally's face.

               GINA
          You need to call your dad.

               JOE
          Leave us alone right now.

               GINA
          I've booked you a flight and packed you a
          bag.  You just need to get into a car and
          go.

               SALLY
          Would you leave us alone right now?

               GINA
          I love her too, Joe.

               JOE
          Alright, good.  Thanks for your trouble.
          So will you leave Sally and me alone
          right now?

               SALLY
               (a shrug; simply)
          Everybody hates the messenger.

     Gina exits.

               SALLY (CONT'D)
               (to Joe)
          I'm coming with you.

     Joe starts to cry.  Sally holds him, kisses him, strokes him,
     rocks him.

               JOE
               (inconsolable)
          I don't want you to go.

     He wipes tears away that start afresh; his nose is running,
     he wipes that too.

               JOE (CONT'D)
          I can't got tonight.  I don't want to be
          on a plane on my own tonight.

               SALLY
          I'll be with you.

               JOE
          I don't want to go tonight.

               SALLY
          You don't have to.

     They sit on the floor.  Sally soothing, rocking Joe like a
     baby.

               JOE
               (bereft)
          Stupid tart.

     INT. KITCHEN - LATER

     Gina's put up some coffee.  Sophia, Cal, Mac and Clair stand
     around awkwardly.  Sally comes into the room.

               MAC
          How's he doing?

               SALLY
          Not good.

               GINA
          He's gonna miss his flight.

               SALLY
          Yeah.

     Al the guests are a little stunned.

               GINA
          Is he not going?  I booked a flight.

               SALLY
          He's not going tonight.

               GINA
          I told his father he'd be on that flight.

               SALLY
          Well you could tell him otherwise.  It
          was good of you to be all this help.  But
          he doesn't want to go tonight.

               GINA
          Jesus, Sally.  I'm not the enemy.

               SALLY
          And you're not the wife.

               GINA
          It's not a contest.

               SALLY
          Damn straight.

               CAL
          Should I go up?

               SALLY
          I don't think so.

               CAL
          You want us to stay?

               SALLY
          Maybe not.

               MAC
          So much for ecstacy, right?

     They all laugh a little.

               SOPHIA
          Let's get the kids.

               CLAIR
          Oh my God, the sitter.

               SALLY
               (laughs)
          Oh Clair, you're so... You know.  You
          just put things in perspective.

     INT. MUSIC LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

     Joe listens to the answering machine message Lucy left that
     morning.  He plays it again and again.

     HE fast forwards to his father's voice.  Presses the STOP
     button.  Sits there, stunned.

               JOE
               (dials phone, a moment)
          Hey, Dad...

     INT. GUEST BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Cal and Sophia bundle up their sleeping kids.  The CAMERA
     follows them to the landing as they head downstairs, pass
     Sally who is coming up.

               SOPHIA
          I'm going to be home all weekend, call if
          you need anything.

     Sally kisses Cal's cheek.

               CAL
          Hang in.

     INT. MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Panes and Skye are fucking on Joe and Sally's bed.  Sally
     walks in on them searching for Panes' ear, her best buddy.

               SALLY
               (resigned)
          Oh perfect!

     EXT. BACKYARD LANDING - MEDIUM FULL SHOT

     Jerry and Judy lie alongside each other, hands propping
     heads.  They aren't privy to anything that's happened.

               JERRY
          I call that a perfect day.

               JUDY
          A perfect night.

               JERRY
          Damn near.
               (long moment)
          And a damn near perfect drug.

               JUDY
          Hm.  We should do it again.

               JERRY
          Just every once in a blue moon, you know.

               JUDY
          Hm.
               (a long moment)
          You think we should ask them for their
          landscaper?

               JERRY
          Hm.  Do you like fucking out of doors?

               JUDY
          Not as a rule.

               JERRY
               (a long moment)
          They didn't sign their goddamn tax
          returns!

     EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     Sally stands at the threshold, watches Cal and Sophia load
     their kids into the car.

     INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS

     Clair and Mac and Gina hug and say their goodbyes to Sally.

               GINA
               (kisses Sally; whispers)
          Take good care of it.

               SALLY
          Count on it.

     EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     Monica and Ryan return from their unsuccessful search.  They
     come through the gate with it's sight: KEEP GATE CLOSED.
     Monica and Ryan start for the kitchen entrance.

     INT. KITCHEN - FROM MONICA AND RYAN'S POV

     Sally and Joe are alone in the room.  They hold each other,
     weep...

               RYAN
               (appalled)
          Jesus Christ, it's a fucking dog!

               MONICA
               (regards them)
          Don't go in, Ryan.

               RYAN
          What?

               MONICA
          Let's just go home, okay?

     INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

     A much embarrassed Panes and Skye enter.

               PANES
          Coffee?

               JOE
          Sure.

               PANES
          I'll do it.

     Panes starts to make some; Skye starts to clean up glasses
     and ashtrays.

               SALLY
          You don't need to do that.

               SKYE
          I don't mind...

               SALLY
          Relax.  You've done enough.

     EXT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

     We see Judy and Jerry bounding around the side of the house.
     Jerry has his briefcase in his hand.  They are laughing.
     They enter the kitchen.  The camera stays outside.  We see
     them brought up short by the gloom, but hear nothing.

     INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

     Sally and Joe are at the table, signing their tax returns.
     Jerry supervising.  All is quiet.  Judy's sunk into a chair.

     INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS

     Morning's finally come.  Light fills the room, empty except
     for party debris.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     It's empty but for glasses, wrapping paper, abandoned dishes
     of leftover cake.

     INT. EMPTY KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

     INT. GUEST BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

     The bed is rumpled and indented from the sleeping children.
     Their drawings and paints strewn all over the floor...and
     Walls.

     INT. EMPTY DEN - CONTINUOUS

     INT. MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

     The bed still shows the remains of Panes and Skye's love
     making.

     The CAMERA moves through the suite into the bathroom.
     Sally's in the tub.  Joe comes into the room in the buff.

               JOE
          Can I come in?

     Sally looks up at the nakedness.

               SALLY
          Sure.

     HE slips into the tub with her.  They lie there facing each
     other.

               OE
          My plane leaves in a few hours.

               SALLY
          Okay.  Do you want me to come with you?

               JOE
               (simply)
          No.

               SALLY
          Okay.

               JOE
               (a moment)
          Pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't
          it?

               SALLY
          I guess.

               JOE
          Life gets messy.  Ugly messy.  But I
          don't understand you.  And I don't think
          I ever understood Lucy.  I don't
          understand throwing it away.  How do you
          throw all that away?  Any of it.  I want
          it all.  You guys want guarantees?  I
          want the possibilities.  And all kinds of
          crap comes with that.  A lot of bad shit.
          And I think that's okay with me because,
          because of the rest of the stuff.  All
          the good shit.  All the surprises.  It's
          a fucking miracle when you come down to
          it.
               (a moment)
          We'd have had amazing children, you and
          me.  We'd have had a ride.  You'd have
          surprised yourself.
               (regards her)
          I'll never love anybody else, you know.

               SALLY
               (a little choked laugh)
          Me too.

               JOE
          That's under lock and key.

               SALLY
          Me too.

     Joe reaches out of the tub for gift-wrapped box.  He hands it
     to sally.  It's their ritual gift-giving site.

     Sally opens the gift.  Takes out a Calder mobile.

               JOE
          Happy anniversary.

               SALLY
          It's a Calder.

               JOE
          I know.

               SALLY
          He's my favorite.

               JOE
          I know.  It's for the baby's crib.

               SALLY
          Ah...

     She hands him a small wooden box.  He opens it, takes out a
     set of keys.

               SALLY (CONT'D)
          They're the keys to your grandad's flat.
          Happy anniversary, baby.

               JOE
          Oh, Sally Mae...

     He can't say anymore.

               SALLY
          I know.

               JOE
          Will you make love with me?

               SALLY
          Sure.

     She reaches out with both arms.

     INT. BATHROOM - TIGHT CLOSE

     Joe and Sally tenderly make love.  It's the dissolution of
     their marriage.

     out...

     INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MEDIUM CLOSE

     The two wedding rings rest on the nightstand, hers nestled in

     it.

     EXT. HOUSE - LATE MORNING

     The "FOR SALE" sign is hammered into the ground.

     Otis wanders along the street, up the driveway and disappears
