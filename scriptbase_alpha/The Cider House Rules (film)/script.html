<b>                                  THE CIDER HOUSE RULES
</b>


                                       Written by

                                       John Irving



                                                         Production Draft

<b>                
</b>
<b>               FADE IN. BEGIN TITLE SEQUENCE.
</b>
<b>               EXT. ST CLOUD'S - TRAIN STATION - DAWN
</b>
               An establishing shot of the rundown train station on an 
               overcast morning. There's snow on the station platform. A 
               train arrives and departs.

<b>                                     LARCH (V.O.)
</b>                         In other parts of the world, young 
                         men of promise leave home to make 
                         their fortunes, battle evil, or solve 
                         the problems of the world.

               Behind the station, at the top of the hill, lies the St. 
               Cloud's orphanage.

<b>                                     LARCH (V.O.)
</b>                         I was myself such a young man, when 
                         I came to save the orphanage in St. 
                         Cloud's... many years ago.

<b>               EXT. ST. CLOUD'S - ORPHANAGE - EARLY MORNING
</b>
               A man and woman (COUPLE #1) make their way toward the main 
               entrance of the large brick building.

<b>                                     LARCH (V.O.)
</b>                         Here in St. Cloud's, I have come to 
                         understand that promises are rarely 
                         kept, that the battle isn't so much 
                         against evil as ignorance, and that 
                         being successful can't hold a candle 
                         to being of *use*.

               The couple enters the orphanage, where we hear the sound of 
               babies.

<b>                                     LARCH (V.O.)
</b>                         Nor have I solved the problem I came 
                         here to solve.

<b>               INT. ORPHANAGE - MORNING
</b>
               Two nurses, EDNA and ANGELA, chase CHILDREN--a morning 
               routine.

<b>                                     LARCH (V.O.)
</b>                         Even in the most enlightened times, 
                         unwanted babies will manage to be 
                         born. That there will always be 
                         orphans is simple not a problem to 
                         be solved. Here is St. Cloud's, we 
                         don't regard the sordid facts of 
                         life as problems.

               The camera goes up the stairs with some of the kids.

<b>               INT. LARCH'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
               We enter an office where DR. LARCH shows couple #1 their 
               newly adopted son, HOMER, an infant who lies smiling in Dr. 
               Larch's arms.

<b>                                     LARCH (V.O.)
</b>                         In truth, we've only had one real 
                         problem.

               We close in on the infant until his face fills the screen.

<b>                                     LARCH (V.O.)
</b>                         His name was Homer Wells.

               Dr. Larch hands over the infant to the adopting parents.

<b>                                     LARCH
</b>                         I named him after the Greek writer. 
                         You know Homer, of course?

               Hesitant nods. (They don't look as if they read.)

<b>                                     LARCH
</b>                         I made his name "Wells" because I 
                         could tell he was very deep.

               The parents look with pride at their adopted son.

<b>                                     LARCH (V.O.)
</b>                         In truth, Nurse Angela named him--
                         her father *drilled* wells, and 
                         "Homer" was one of her family's 
                         umpteen cats.

<b>               INT./EXT. ORPHANAGE - DAY
</b>
               At the front door, Larch and the nurses wave and call good-
               bye to Homer, they close the door.

<b>               INT./EXT. ORPHANAGE - NIGHT
</b>
               The same door swings open; it's another night. The same couple 
               is bringing Homer back. There is concern in their faces as 
               Nurse Edna lets them in.

<b>               INT. BOY'S DIVISION, DOORWAY - NIGHT
</b>
               Larch is delivering his benediction to the boys.

<b>                                     LARCH
</b>                         "Good night, you Princes of Maine, 
                         you Kings of New England!"

               As he turns, he is startled by Nurse Edna, waiting with couple 
               #1 and baby Homer.

<b>                                     ADOPTING MOTHER
</b>                         There's something wrong with him! He 
                         never makes a sound.

               Larch looks quickly at Homer.

<b>                                     LARCH (V.O.)
</b>                         He didn't cry enough for them, if 
                         you can believe it.

<b>                                     ADOPTING FATHER
</b>                         Do you think we could have a look at 
                         someone a little different?

               The mother hands over the baby to Larch. Baby Homer lets out 
               a happy squeal as soon as he's in Larch's arms. The parents 
               stare in disbelief.

<b>                                     LARCH (V.O.)
</b>                         Thus was Homer Wells returned. He 
                         was too happy a baby.

<b>               EXT. ORPHANAGE - DAY
</b>
               Angela and Edna call and wave good-bye to a two-year-old 
               Homer, leaving with COUPLE #2. Larch stands on the porch and 
               watches the family head down the hill.

<b>                                     LARCH (V.O.)
</b>                         The second family has an unfortunate 
                         gift for getting sounds out of Homer.

<b>               INT. COUPLE #2'S HOME - DAY
</b>
               Larch bursts into the home of the second couple and lifts a 
               crying and bruised Homer out of his bed. There is rage in 
               Larch's eyes as he looks at the couple.

<b>                                     LARCH (V.O.)
</b>                         The rumor was true. They beat him. 
                         He couldn't stop crying.

<b>               EXT. HILL, ST. CLOUD'S - DAY
</b>
               Larch carries Homer up the orphanage hill.

<b>                                     LARCH (V.O.)
</b>                         Here is St. Cloud's, I try to 
                         consider, with each rule I make or 
                         break, that my first priority is an 
                         orphan's future.

<b>               INT. DELIVERY ROOM - DAY
</b>
               The naked belly of a VERY PREGNANT WOMAN.

<b>                                     LARCH (V.O.)
</b>                         Easier said than done.

               A tiny hand comes in with a stethoscope and puts it on the 
               big belly. Young Homer's head, with the stethoscope around 
               his neck, pops up behind the belly; he closes his eyes as he 
               concentrates on listening to the sounds of the unborn child. 
               Larch stops in the doorway, catching sight of Homer. He smiles 
               faintly.

<b>               EXT. COUPLE #3'S HOME - DAY

               The door opens to a THIRD COUPLE smiling at us, welcoming 
               and embracing a sixteen-year-old Homer. Behind them waits 
               the would-be STEPSISTER--an attractive girl, a little older 
               then Homer.

</b>                         I told the third family to take good 
                         care--this was a special boy.

<b>               INT. STEPSISTER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               Homer and the stepsister are in bed together. The parents 
               burst in on them--the father chasing Homer around and around 
               the bed, the mother beating her daughter, who covers herself 
               with a pillow.

</b>                         It was Homer who took too much good 
                         care of himself.

<b>               EXT. COUPLE #3'S HOME - NIGHT
</b>
               From her window, the stepsister watches Homer leave the house 
               carrying his suitcase. Homer looks up at her as he walks to 
               the street.

<b>               EXT. ORPHANAGE - EARLY MORNING
</b>
               It's after dawn, but still a little dark, as Homer walks to 
               the orphanage door, suitcase in hand. A HUGELY PREGNANT WOMAN 
               arrives at the same time. They stand awkwardly next to each 
               other, waiting for someone to answer the door. The woman is 
               crying. Homer reaches out and takes her hand.

<b>                                     HOMER
</b>                         Don't be frightened. Everyone is 
                         nice here.

</b>                         I just belong here.

               The woman sniffles; she nods vaguely. The door opens. Nurse 
               Edna lets the woman in and embraces Homer.

<b>                                     LARCH (V.O.)
</b>                         What could I do with him? He kept 
                         coming back!

<b>               INT. LARCH'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
               Larch instructs an older Homer from "Gray's Anatomy." Homer 
               is bored and looks out the window.

<b>                                     LARCH
</b>                         Homer, if you're going to stay at 
                         St. Cloud's, I expect you to be of 
                         use.

<b>               INT. DELIVERY ROOM - DAY
</b>
               Homer looks adoringly at Dr. Larch as Larch examines ANOTHER 
               PREGNANT WOMAN. Larch waves Homer over; he places the boy's 
               hand on the woman's abdomen, to feel the fetus kicking.

<b>                                     LARCH (V.O.)
</b>                         But, in failing to withhold love, 
                         had I created a true and everlasting 
                         orphan? I had been too successful 
                         with Homer Wells. I had managed to 
                         make the orphanage his *home*.

<b>               INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY
</b>
               Larch closes a door quickly behind him (so that Homer doesn't 
               see the ABORTION PATIENT in the O.R.)

<b>               INT. DELIVERY ROOM - DAY
</b>
               Homer assists Larch in delivering a BABY.

<b>               EXT. INCINERATOR - DAY
</b>
               Homer carries a white enamel pail to the incinerator. He 
               looks inside the pail; he stops.

<b>                                     LARCH (V.O.)
</b>                         God forgive me. I have *made* an 
                         orphan by loving him too much. Homer 
                         Wells will belong to St. Cloud's, 
                         forever.

               Hold on Homer's disgusted expression as he stares at the 
               contents of the pail.

               END TITLE SEQUENCE. FADE OUT. We hear a song playing on an 
               old phonograph.

<b>               INT. DISPENSARY - DAY
</b>
               We see the song playing on the old phonograph. Dr. Larch is 
               taking ether. He holds the bottle in one hand, the cone over 
               his mouth and nose with the other.

<b>               SUPER: ST. CLOUD'S, MAINE, MARCH 1943.
</b>
               When Larch dozes off, his hand loosens its grip on the cone; 
               the cone falls off his face, and he wakes up. Then he puts 
               the cone back in place, dripping more ether from the bottle 
               to the gauze covering the cone.

               Pan the dispensary, which also serves as Larch's photo gallery 
               and bedroom apartment. The ether-bed is separated from the 
               room by a hospital curtain (the kind on casters). We see the 
               recording revolving, the glass-encased cabinets of medical 
               supplies, the old photographs of St. Cloud's.

               Homer enters, he stands uncomfortably, watching Larch for a 
               moment. Then he turns around and walks back into the corridor.

<b>               INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
               Homer calls out as though he's just coming down the corridor.

<b>               INT. DISPENSARY - DAY
</b>
               Larch wakes up; he shakes off the ether haze. Homer reenters.

               Dr. Larch and Homer leave together.

               The *two* doctors walk briskly down the hall, a couple of 
               professionals.

                         how to do it--you just showed me.

</b>                         What *else* could I have showed you, 
                         Homer? The only thing I can teach 
                         you is what I know! In every life, 
                         you've got to be of use.

               Homer and Larch split off and disappear into two different 
               operating rooms. As he goes, Homer mumbles to himself, "Of 
               use, of use, of use."

               Mary Agnes smiles at Homer; then she sticks her tongue out

               corridor; a suitcase is next to him.

               Homer embraces Curly and lifts him up, he grabs the suitcase 
               and continues down the corridor.

               Angela is singing along with the song on the phonograph, a

               won't give him back the ether cone; he rolls away from her, 
               but she tickles him and bites his ear, coaxing him into a

               Dr. Larch stops in the doorway; he watches with concern.

               Homer holds the girl still--she is babbling on and on while 
               Larch is examining her.

<b>                                     TWELVE-YEAR-OLD GIRL
</b>                         It wasn't me! I would never do no 
                         such thing! I wouldn't stick that 
                         inside me! It wasn't me!

               Larch, his wild eye peering into the speculum, makes an 
               audible gasp from the shock of what he sees inside the girl. 
               Larch tells Homer to have a look. Larch then whispers 
               something to Edna; she brings the ether bottle and cone 
               quickly. Larch starts putting the cone in place, over the 
               nose and mouth of the frightened girl. Homer bends to the 
               speculum.

                              old)
                         Listen, you've been very brave. I'm 
                         going to put you to sleep--you won't 
                         feel it anymore. You've been brave 
                         enough.

               Homer stares into the speculum; he closes his eyes. The girl 
               is resisting the ether, but her eyelids flutter closed.

</b>                         You *bet* it's a heavy sedation! The 
                         fetus is unexpelled, her uterus is 
                         punctured, she has acute peritonitis, 
                         and there's a foreign object. I think 
                         it's a crochet hook.

               Homer has pulled off his surgical mask. He leans over the 
               scrub sink, splashing cold water on his face.

                         and asked you for a simple D and C, 
                         what would you have decided to do? 
                         *Nothing*? *This* is what doing 
                         nothing gets you, Homer. It means 
                         that someone else is going to do the 
                         job--some moron who doesn't know 
                         *how*!

               Homer, furious, leaves the operating room. Edna lifts the 
               girl's eyelids for Larch so that he can see how well under 
               the ether she is.

               Homer storms down the hall, then stops, pulling off his white 
               coat. Angry, pacing, he kicks at nothing.

               Buster and Homer are digging the pit. Larch paces by the

               Buster nods, but he's totally bewildered.

                         If you expect people to be responsible

                         agree?

               Buster doesn't get it. Homer has heard this too many times; 
               he rolls his eyes.

               Homer looks away.

               Larch studies him.

               Buster is driving the old pickup truck, with the shovels and 
               a wheelbarrow in the back. Larch and Homer are in the cab, 
               they are being bounced all over the cab by Buster's wild 
               driving. Larch looks at Homer; he stares at him with a curious 
               smile.

               Larch says nothing. Homer gives him a look.

               Buster is distracted; he drives the truck into a ditch and 
               it bounces around, missing a tree by an inch. He is up on 
               the road again in a few seconds.

               They are all distracted by a luxurious convertible that 
               overtakes them on the hill to the orphanage. The fast car is 
               driven by a handsome man in the uniform of the Army Air Corps--
               a YOUNG OFFICER. From the passenger seat, a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG 
               WOMAN smiles at them, rendering them speechless.

               The luxurious convertible (now parked) has drawn all the 
               orphans to it. The handsome young officer (WALLY) and the 
               beautiful young woman (CANDY) stand confused by the car; 
               they are surrounded by the curious orphans, with whom they 
               are painfully self-conscious. They are overly friendly to 
               the children as they are anxious of Larch and Homer and Buster 
               (in their gravedigging attire), who are getting out of the 
               truck. Nervously, Wally gives the children chocolates.

               Curly tugs on Candy's dress, staring up at her, his face

               Candy and Wally can't conceal how impressed they are with 
               the young Homer.

               Homer walks down the corridor, dressed in his operating gown, 
               as the door to the O.R. opens and Wally stumbles out, 
               hurriedly opening a window. Wally breathes deeply to regain 
               his composure.

                         got to me.
                              (pause)
                         God. This is all my fault.

               Edna comes down the hall with a dirt-stained, crying Curly 
               who's covering one eye.

                         Steerforth got into the pantry--he's 
                         eaten all the pie dough.

               Homer nods to Edna, who is marching off with Curly. Wally 
               smiles at Homer.

                         calm all the time.

               Wally hears Homer's facetiousness--how tired he is of his 
               heart condition.

               Homer appreciates the joke.

               The door to the operating room that Wally exited opens into 
               the corridor; Candy is being wheeled out on a gurney by Larch 
               and Angela. Wally rushes to Candy's side. Homer follows 
               slowly. Candy is groggy, coming out of the ether.

               Cranked at three-quarters, Fuzzy sits in bed, wheezing and 
               coughing. He's drawing with great intensity, using crayons 
               on a piece of paper held by a clipboard. Homer sits on the 
               end of Fuzzy's bed, cleaning up Steerforth. Homer pauses to 
               look out of the window; he sees Wally, dashing and spotless 
               in his uniform beside his flashy car. A life Homer might 
               have had crosses his face.

               Homer turns to Fuzzy, who holds up his picture--a big pumpkin 
               with a jack-o-lantern face.

               Homer runs up the stairs, two steps at a time; he races into 
               a corridor at full speed, exhilarated. Suddenly Dr. Larch 
               appears in front of him. Homer stops abruptly, out of breath,

               As Homer stands guiltily, Larch rifles through an X-ray file,

               Homer is packing his things--we see the heart X ray, and 
               some photos of Larch and Edna and Angela.

               Larch approaches Homer with a small bundle of clothes.

                         I think these will fit you.

               Homer is grateful and ashamed. Before he can speak, Edna is 
               there--a wad of bills in her hand. She tries to put the money 
               in his pocket; when he refuses it, she simply puts the money 
               in his open suitcase, stuffing the bills under his clothes.

                         something, until you find a job.

               Larch and Edna retreat from him, humbly, as if they were his 
               servants.

               As Homer puts his stuff in the truck of Wally's car, Angela 
               can't resist touching his face. She is too upset to speak.

               From a window, Larch is watching the departure. He sees Homer 
               saying goodbye to the children, embracing them.

               From another window, Fuzzy just stares. (Of course he's 
               coughing.)

               We see Wally carrying Candy to the car.

               She speaks to Homer, touching his sleeve, like a sleepy 
               person, as Wally puts her gently in the backseat.

                         Coming with us? It's always a good 
                         idea to have a doctor along for the 
                         ride.

               Homer gets in the passenger seat beside Wally, who starts 
               the car; suddenly there is Curly. Homer can't look at Curly, 
               who looks betrayed. Edna picks up Curly and carries him to 
               the passenger-side window. Curly is sobbing.

                         I couldn't find Buster. Will you 
                         tell him...

               He can't finish what he has to say. Edna kisses him good-
               bye.

               From the window, Larch watches the car leave.

               Buster, whittling a stick, isn't watching.

               There is quiet as the journey gets underway. Wally keeps 
               glancing at Candy in the rear-view mirror; she seems distant, 
               lost in thought. Homer is taking everything in--the speed,

               The radio is playing. Candy is lying down, her knees drawn 
               up, in the backseat; she appears to be asleep, oblivious to 
               Homer and Wally's conversation.

                         and now I'm on leave to help my mother--
                         I'm just trying to get her ready for 
                         the harvest. She's no farmer. Apples 
                         were my dad's business. And with the 
                         war on, she's short on pickers.

               Candy's eyes are open but her voice is groggy.

               Candy's eyes snap open and she sits up a little.

               The car is parked at the side of the road. Wally is half-
               hidden behind a tree. Candy and Homer are left alone in the 
               car; there's an awkward silence as Homer pretends not to 
               hear Wally's excessive peeing. Suddenly Candy starts to sob.

               Homer and Wally sit on the beach a short distance from Candy's 
               blanket. She appears to be asleep. Wally looks in her 
               direction before he speaks to Homer.

               On Candy's face: she's not asleep; she's listening.

               Homer's smile suggests that he's impressed, but that he 
               wouldn't have Wally's enthusiasm for the task. Wally laughs 
               and puts his hand on Homer's shoulder.

               The car is parked at a lobster pound. Homer sits in the car

               Candy turns and heads toward the house to catch up with Wally. 
               A lobsterman in his boat is approaching the dock. It's RAY,

               Homer as never seen such a room: the sports trophies, the 
               photos of athletic teams, and of Candy with Wally. Model 
               airplanes are everywhere. Mrs. Worthington's voice comes 
               from the hall.

               She appears in the doorway of Wally's room. Mrs. Worthington 
               (OLIVE) is an elegant, fiftyish New Englander, as handsome 
               as Wally, but more reserved. She is surprised to see Homer.

                         the apple business.

               Wally is taking his uniform off as he speaks, just dropping 
               it on the floor as he quickly puts on some farm clothes.

               Mrs. Worthington starts picking up her son's uniform from

               Homer looks confused; he seems to have forgotten about the 
               alleged wedding. Wally puts his arm around Homer, urging him

               Homer and Wally get out of the jeep at the cider house, a 
               barnlike building with adjacent sheds and, behind it, line 
               after line of trees--the apple orchards.

               Homer sees an outdoor shower where THREE BLACK MEN are 
               showering. It is a wooden stall that leaves the shower's 
               occupants visible above and below their midsections. A FOURTH 
               BLACK MAN is caught naked, running behind the cider house 
               and out of sight as he wraps a towel around himself.

               Homer wonders what that means as Wally reaches for the door 
               of the cider house. Before Wally can knock, a pretty young 
               black girl, ROSE ROSE, bumps open the screen door with her

               Homer with Mr. Rose, Rose Rose, and the other black pickers. 
               Mr. Rose takes an apple from a bowl on the table. Then he 
               pulls out a knife and opens it in one fluid motion; he's so 
               fast, the knife seems to come out of nowhere. He begins to 
               peel the apple. Homer eyes Mr. Rose, but Mr. Rose's focus is

                              (to Homer)
                         Peaches is from Georgia, where we 
                         met him pickin' peaches. He's still 
                         better with peaches than hs is with 
                         apples.
                              (Peaches grins)
                         Jack here is new. And this here is 
                         Hero, 'cause he was a hero of some 
                         kind or other once. Ain't that right, 
                         Hero?

               There are some disrespectful suggestions from the pickers 
               concerning what his heroism might have been.

                         is Muddy. The less said about Muddy, 
                         the better. Ain't that right, Muddy?

               Muddy scowls at Homer, but he smiles at Mr. Rose.

               Homer unpacks his suitcase. (His bed should be nearest Muddy's 
               and Mr. Rose's.) Jack lies on his bed, smoking. Muddy, also 
               smoking, is sitting on his bed, sharpening a knife. Hero and 
               Peaches are playing cards on one of their beds. Mr. Rose is 
               finishing shaving. Rose Rose watches Homer unpack.

</b>                         There's a little something wrong 
                         with it. Just this part here--the 
                         right ventricle. It's slightly 
                         enlarged.

</b>                         Yes, so what. It's nothing serious, 
                         really. Just a small defect.

</b>                         Right.

               Rose Rose picks up the book that Homer has put on the bed. 
               She studies the cover; it's "Great Expectations" by Charles 
               Dickens. She puts it down, restlessly.

</b>                         They told Muddy his feet was too 
                         flat!

               Everybody laughs, except Muddy.

                         And you was "generally unfit," as I 
                         recall.

               Finished unpacking, Homer sits on his bed; he picks up "Great 
               Expectations" and begins to read. Rose Rose sits down next 
               to him, watching him read. Homer notices her interest.

                         I can't read. Nobody taught me.

               Homer smiles politely and goes back to his book. Rose Rose 
               keeps looking over his shoulder at the pages.

                         What does it say there?

               Homer looks around at the pickers lying in their beds, 
               smoking, listening. (Like bedtime stories at the orphanage, 
               he thinks; however, the picker's attitude is suspicious, 
               reserved.)

<b>                                     HOMER

                         "I looked at the stars, and considered 
                         how awful it would be for a man to 
                         turn his face to them as he froze to 
                         death, and see no help or pity in 
                         all the glittering multitude."

               Homer looks up; there's no response.

                         More?

               Some muttering, some giggling, mostly silence. Rose Rose 
               wants more, but suddenly Jack jumps out of bed and stomps to 
               the kitchen end of the cider house, where a piece of paper 
               is tacked to the wall. Jack is talking to Homer all the way.

                         enough to read... what's this?

               Jack points at the piece of paper. Homer gets up and looks 
               at it.

               Rose Rose stomps back to her bed. Her father absently snaps

               Wally in his farm clothes at the wheel of the Jeep--he is 
               racing through the orchards, dodging trees, with Homer in 
               the passenger seat, hanging on for dear life.

                         the Jeep slide on the grass. Can you 
                         feel it?

               Homer is excited as Wally weaves among the trees--faster and 
               faster.

               Wally brakes hard. The Jeep comes to a stop in the packing-
               house area.

               Candy has been waiting on the loading platform. The pickers

               vehicle's grille--or else the branch is wedged in the front -
               bumper or headlight area. Candy playfully starts poking Wally

               Homer is unfamiliar with this kind of kidding around; at 
               first he is startled, but then he laughs. Wally laughs, too. 
               They shake hands.

               Mr. Rose calls out to Homer from the tractor. The pickers 
               are impatiently waiting for him on the flatbed; they're going 
               back to the orchard. Homer has to run to catch up to them. 
               He jumps on the flatbed; he sees Wally waving good-bye.

               High up in a tall tree on a couple of ladders, Mr. Rose and 
               Homer are picking side by side. Mr. Rose is picking with 
               high-speed perfection, but Homer is slower and fumbling--he 
               drops an occasional apple to the ground.

                         stems with the apples only half the 
                         time. They good only for cider, too--
                         if you don't pick them stems.
                              (Homer watches him)
                         The rule is, you wanna pick the apple 
                         *with* the stem, Homer. And see 
                         here... see that *bud* that's just 
                         above the stem? That's the bud for

                         the *spur*. You pick the spur, you

                         the branch, you hear?

               Homer nods; he picks more carefully, with more concentration.

               Homer can see over the apple mart parking lot from the top 
               of the tree. He can see the driveway of the Worthington house, 
               where Candy and Olive are saying a tearful good-bye to Wally. 
               Distracted, Homer drops another couple of apples, which Mr. 
               Rose observes with a wry smile.

               A newsreel from the war is playing on the screen--soldiers 
               marching, smiling, waving to the camera. Homer and Candy sit

               The rain beats down on Olive's car. Homer gets soaking wet 
               as he leans in to talk to Candy, who's behind the wheel. Mr. 
               Rose calls to Homer from the doorway of the mill room.

               Mr. Rose is instructing Homer as they stand bottling cider 
               in their yellow slickers and rubber boots. Rose Rose is hosing 
               down the pressboards; Muddy and Hero and Peaches are operating 
               the grinder and the press. Jack is stirring the vat. In a 
               defiant, contemptuous way, Jack keeps flicking the ash of 
               his cigarette into the vat. This make everyone uncomfortable; 
               only Mr. Rose doesn't appear to notice.

               We never see Mr. Rose's knife. We see the men circle each 
               other: Jack takes a swipe at Mr. Rose's head--then he steps 
               back, his yellow slicker slashed open. His slicker is opened 
               up, right up the middle. His shirt underneath the slicker is 
               slashed open, too--he feels his bare chest and stomach, 
               feeling for the cut. But there's no cut--Jack's not bleeding, 
               he's not even scratched. Just his clothes have been slashed.

               Mr. Rose has cut his own hand in the fight. Homer's 
               professionalism if offended to watch Rose Rose's amateurish

               Homer's expression changes from exhilarated to guilty. He 
               leans back in his seat and looks straight ahead at the screen. 
               Candy tentatively leans her head on his shoulder. Homer looks 
               afraid to breathe.

               From behind, with her head on his shoulder, they look like a 
               normal couple. We track in toward the huge screen until we 
               see only the screen. There are shadows on the black screen. 
               Suddenly the movie "King Kong" appears.

               "King Kong" is playing against the bare, white wall. Fuzzy 
               is very weak, but he smiles at the sight of the love-struck 
               Kong holding the screaming Fay Wray in his giant hand. Dr. 
               Larch runs the projector; he sits close beside Fuzzy. When 
               the film breaks in the predictable place, Fuzzy makes no 
               protest. Dr. Larch looks at Fuzzy, who has stopped breathing; 
               his eyes are closed.

               They are alone in the dining hall. Larch has wheeled in Fuzzy

               As the men sit at the picnic table eating their cornbread, 
               Rose Rose pours coffee. A jeep comes down the orchard road 
               toward them. It's Olive. Mr. Rose leads the "Good mornin', 
               Mrs. Worthin'ton!" greeting. Olive has an armful of clothing

               Homer lies awake in bed; everyone else is asleep. Homer pulls 
               the package out from under his bed, opening it just enough

               The beach at sunset. Candy and Homer, dressed for cooler 
               weather, are alone at the water's edge. From a paper bag, 
               Candy is scattering some small, brightly colored pieces of 
               broken glass.

                         rubbed the glass smooth against the 
                         sand--there won't be any sharp edges.

               She finds and old piece of glass among the stones and shells 
               at the high-tide mark.

                         from some year before. I put glass 
                         here every year. The ocean makes it 
                         beautiful.

               Candy holds up a piece of glass to the sun for Homer to look 
               at. The ocean is a gray-green color, the glass a paler shade 
               of green.

               She rubs the smooth piece of glass against his hand, then 
               throws it toward the water. It falls short. Homer retrieves 
               it. Candy splashes him playfully. He chases her away from 
               the beach, into the pine trees. Homer locks his arms around 
               her, from behind. He can't let go. She lets him hold her, 
               then breaks his grip. She turns to face him. She is taller 
               then he is, older, obviously more experienced. She initiates 
               the kiss. They drop to the ground right there; they make 
               love by the roots of the tree, Candy guiding him.

                         Wally likes everyone.

               Olive's thoughts drift; her eyes look up at a photo of Wally.

               Homer is tense. Does Olive suspect about Candy?

               The pickers are moving out; the harvest is over. Olive and

               Following Ray's example, Homer is trying to "disarm" the 
               lobsters' big claws by blocking them shut with the little 
               wooden wedges. Roy works quickly, never getting pinched. As

                         which I would define as the first

               we see a hidden (and stricken) Candy, naked from their 
               interrupted lovemaking.

               of the mood. Candy laughs, but she picks up a pillow and 
               swings it at him, hitting him. He dances away from her. She 
               throws the pillow; he ducks--the pillow lands somewhere near 
               the door. Now Homer grabs a pillow and chases her from bed 
               to bed. She shrieks--they're both laughing. They each grab a 
               pillow and stand toe to toe whacking each other, laughing 
               all the while, until he pins her arms behind her and, 
               breathing hard--and despite the stupid music that broke the 
               mood--they are passionately kissing again.

               The sound of a truck is sudden and loud.

               Mr. Rose's truck has arrived. The pickers are hopping out of

               The door opens. Hero and Peaches barge in, as Homer and Candy 
               are struggling to return the pillows to the beds.

               Muddy is right behind them. He picks up a pillow, off the 
               floor, looking for which bed it belongs on.

               Then comes Mr. Rose, slyly smiling, taking it all in--there's 
               no hiding what's going on. Homer and Candy are caught, their 
               shirts untucked and half-unbuttoned--they're still out of 
               breath. The pillows lie crazily on the beds, each one of 
               which has been stepped on.

               She plops down her stuff on her bed, looking only at Candy.

               Rose Rose stops; she can't even continue setting the table. 
               Her voice turns bitter, despairing.

               There, suddenly, is Mr. Rose, walking past them. He is 
               uncharacteristically tentative.

               Mr. Rose leaves Candy and Rose Rose alone again. Rose Rose 
               nods almost invisibly after her father. Rose Rose looks 
               pointedly at Candy, nodding. Candy slowly gets it. Mr. Rose 
               is the father! Rose Rose lets that sink in; she keeps looking 
               at Candy with an ashamed expression.

               The pickers are at work, on their ladders, when Candy runs 
               down the aisle between two rows of trees. She stops at the 
               bottom of Homer's ladder, out of breath. Muddy and Peaches 
               and Hero, in the treetops, are watching and listening.

               The pickers can't help but hear this, too. Candy starts to 
               leave, Homer running after her.

               Smiling his enigmatic smile, Mr. Rose keeps slowly picking 
               while Homer stands at the foot of his ladder.

               Mr. Rose stops picking, his eyes darting to see who's around.

               Mr. Rose is indignant.

               That takes some of the steam out of Homer's superiority.

               By his expression--he looks as if he's been punched--it's 
               clear that Mr. Rose didn't *know that*.

               The other pickers are on their way to lunch; it's obvious 
               that Muddy, Peaches, and Hero already know that Mr. Rose is 
               sleeping with his daughter.

               Rose Rose is sitting at the picnic table when the pickers 
               arrive for lunch, almost simultaneously with Homer. He looks 
               at, then looks away from, Rose Rose. Mr. Rose is the last to 
               sit down at the table as a very tense, wordless lunch begins.

<b>               EXT. ORCHARD - DAY

               Homer is on a ladder picking apples. Muddy climbs a ladder 
               on the other side of the same tree.

                         it.

               Muddy looks all around for Mr. Rose; then he gives Homer his 
               knife.

                         knife to Rose Rose, you hear?

               Homer nods, pocketing the knife. As Muddy climbs down and 
               moves his ladder to an adjacent tree, he keeps talking to 
               Homer until he disappears in the leaves.

               Homer lies awake in his bed.

               The pickers on their ladders in the trees; nobody is talking. 
               In the late sun, the leaves have a reddish, fiery glow.

               It's much colder; the pickers are on their ladders in the 
               trees again, but they're dressed for the cold. Homer is high 
               on a ladder; he turns toward the view of the Worthington 
               house when he hears a car come to a screeching halt in the 
               driveway. Homer sees Candy get out of Wally's car; she leaves 
               the door open and runs toward the house. Parked in front of 
               Wally's car is an Army Jeep, with an ENLISTED MAN leaning 
               against it. The indifferent soldier smokes a cigarette as he 
               watches Candy run.

               Homer descends the ladder and runs for the house, down as 
               aisle between the row of trees. The pickers watch him run.

<b>               INT. WORTHINGTON HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Camera follows Homer into the Worthington house where, from 
               the front hall, he sees Olive and Candy (in profile) sitting 
               on the couch. We can't see who's talking, nor do we recognize 
               the voice. As Homer comes into the living room, we see MAJOR 
               WINSLOW sitting in a chair (also in profile), talking to 
               Olive and Candy.

               Major Winslow is a smooth, handsome well-briefed officer in 
               the casualty branch of the Army Air Corps; he's done his 
               homework, but he's not all business. He's painfully aware of 
               the delicate nature of his report.

                         chief and the radioman jumped close 
                         together. The copilot jumped third. 
                         All on Captain Worthington's orders--
                         the captain was still flying the 
                         plane. None of the men of the ground 
                         could see the sky--that's how thick 
                         the jungle was. They never saw the 
                         plane crash--they never *heard* it 
                         crash. They never saw Captain

               Homer and Candy are sitting in the parked car in silence.

               Homer holds her, doing nothing, while she sobs. As her crying

               Homer walks faster. When he gets to the cider house, he sees 
               Mr. Rose and Rose Rose arguing. Rose is sitting on the 
               bicycle, a bundle of her clothes tied up behind the seat.

                         tomorrow, but it can come back again. 
                         The cramps will ease up, almost 
                         entirely. The bleeding is usually 
                         much lighter in two days. As long as 
                         the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal.

               Muddy enters the cider house from out of the storm. He glances 
               at Candy and Rose Rose; then at Homer. Then he speaks to Mr. 
               Rose.

               Hero and Peaches, dripping wet, come inside. Peaches is 
               standing next to the list of rules tacked to the kitchen 
               support beam.

               Candy covers her face in her hands and cries uncontrollably, 
               unstoppably. Homer's anger keeps him impervious to her tears--
               another "first" for him. He turns and looks at her with an 
               almost clinical curiosity; then he goes back to staring at 
               the blank screen.

                         she gone, I killed myself--that what

                         story--ain't that right?

               Homer and Muddy exchange a glance. Mr. Rose, with his blood-
               soaked hand, suddenly grabs Homer by the throat.

               Mr. Rose dies. Muddy turns away. Homer closes Mr. Rose's 
               eyes.

               Muddy and Hero and Peaches are sitting close together on the 
               roof, like banished children. It is from their perspective 
               that we see the police car and the ambulance--two men carrying 
               the body out of the cider house, and a cop or two talking to 
               Homer and Olive, and Homer talking to them. We hear no 
               dialogue.

<b>               EXT. APPLE MART - DUSK

               Homer and the men load crates of apple jelly onto a truck. 
               The mood is solemn; they work with tired focus. Candy drives 
               up. The men are evasive with her; they find a reason to work 
               across the mart. Candy walks to Homer, stands next to him. 
               They say nothing for a moment, until Candy breaks the silence.

               Candy looks away; she can't think of what to say. She shoves 
               her hands into her pockets, finds a letter there, which she 
               hands to Homer.

               Homer looks at the letter from St. Cloud's; he puts it 
               unopened in his pocket without a second thought. Candy can't 
               let things end there.

               A tear rolls down Candy's cheek, Homer wipes it away; then 
               he stops touching her and looks off into the quiet orchards.

               The pickers lie in their beds, smoking. Homer is undressing. 
               He pulls the letter out of his pocket and sits down on his 
               bed. Homer opens the letter without enthusiasm and begins to 
               read.

               Music is playing on the old phonograph as an exhausted Larch 
               gives himself ether.

               Edna is getting the girls ready for bed. Music continues 
               Over.

</b>
               Larch has twisted himself on the narrow bed so that his face 
               is unusually close to the windowsill, and when the ether 
               cone starts to fall off his face--and his slack hand trails 
               down, off the side of the bed--the cone becomes caught against 
               the windowsill.

               He tries to turn his face away from the cone, but he presses 
               his face into the sill--thus holding the ether-soaked cone 
               over his mouth and nose. His hands twitch, he's trying to 
               wake up; the hand that holds the ether bottle lets the bottle 
               fall. The bottle shatters against the sill; the ether spreads, 
               running red with blood from a cut on Dr. Larch's hand or 
               finger. Music continues Over. It's a funeral.

               In the dispensary: Buster approaches Larch's ether-bed.

               The truck is packed for the long trip south; it passes by 
               the packing house, which looks closed for the season. No one 
               else is about. Muddy is driving slowly, his arm out the open 
               window. In the back, huddled among their belongings, are 
               Peaches and Hero (on one side) and Homer (on the other). The 
               pickers are trying to draw Homer into their conversation, 
               while Homer is giving the apple farm a good-bye look. He has 
               made up his mind about something.

               As the pickers' truck drives past, Homer is on the side of 
               the truck nearest the Worthington house and driveway; he 
               sees Olive and Candy and Ray helping Wally out of the car 
               and into a wheelchair. A NURSE stands by.

               Wally is wearing what appears to be an oversized officer's 
               coat or flight jacket, his face looking small in the overlarge 
               clothes. He can't move his legs at all, and his mouth is 
               drawn into a tight-lipped smile.

                         oranges *naked*, if you want to.

               Olive is dissolved in tears. Candy is sobbing; she kisses 
               Wally, without ceasing, while he haltingly touches her face, 
               her hair.

               In the truck the smile is gone from Homer's face. He shakes 
               his head.

               This makes all the pickers laugh, but Homer just smiles and 
               shakes his head. He watches the Worthington house disappear 
               from view.

               reflection in the black window-glass of the night train when 
               the conductor gets his attention. When the conductor moves 
               on, Homer takes Angela's letter out of his breast pocket; he

               Curly continues his search. Homer thinks for a second; then 
               reaches into his pocket and pulls out the piece of pale-green 
               glass.

<b>                                     HOMER
</b>                         You know what? I did.

               Homer hands the piece of glass to Curly.

<b>                                     HOMER
</b>                         It's from the ocean. It's for you.

               Curly is duly impressed; he walks away to examine his new 
               treasure. Homer continues unpacking. He pulls his X ray out 
               and puts it aside.

<b>                                     BUSTER
</b>                         What are you doing here?

               Homer turns to see Buster, Mary Agnes, Angela, and Edna in 
               the doorway.

<b>                                     MARY AGNES
</b>                         We made up a room for you.

<b>                                     ANGELA
</b>                         Wouldn't you be more comfortable by 
                         yourself?

               Homer smiles; he nods.

               Angela and Mary Agnes start to put Homer's things back in 
               his bag. Edna picks up the X ray and looks at it with a somber 
               expression.

<b>                                     EDNA
</b>                         Homer, do you know what this is?

<b>                                     HOMER
</b>                         Sure. It's my heart.

<b>                                     ANGELA
</b>                              (shakes her head)
                         Actually, it's Fuzzy's. There's 
                         nothing wrong with your heart.

<b>                                     HOMER
</b>                         Fuzzy's?!

<b>                                     EDNA
</b>                         Dr. Larch wanted to keep you out of 
                         the war, Homer--that's why he did 
                         it. That's why he told you it was 
                         yours.

               Homer is stunned; he puts his hand to his heart.

<b>                                     ANGELA
</b>                         I think he worried about his own 
                         heart. He said it would never stand 
                         up to Homer Wells going off to war.

               Homer takes that in; he nods. Mary Agnes touches him 
               sympathetically.

<b>               INT. LARCH'S OFFICE - NIGHT
</b>
               Homer looks at his fake diplomas; they are now framed and 
               hanging on the office wall. Homer surveys the office, as if 
               for the first time; he sits down in the desk chair, as if 
               slowly getting used to his new position.

<b>               INT. BOYS' DIVISION - NIGHT
</b>
               Homer reads to the boys from "David Copperfield". While his 
               voice is strong--positive, optimistic, certainly reassuring 
               to the boys--there is in the conclusion of the chapter 
               something that distracts him. He seems to hesitate; he misses 
               a line or two, and perhaps he purposely skips one or two 
               others. (Possibly Homer's eyes wander ahead, to the title of 
               the next chapter: "I Make Another Beginning.")

<b>                                     HOMER
</b>                         "Thus I began my new life, in a new 
                         name, and with everything new about 
                         me... I felt... like one in a dream... 
                         The remembrance of that life is 
                         fraught with so much... want of 
                         hope... Whether it lasted for a year, 
                         or more, or less, I do not know. I 
                         only know that it was, and ceased to 
                         be; and... there I leave it."

               Homer stops and looks at the boys' faces.

<b>                                     CURLY
</b>                         What happens next?

               Homer smiles.

<b>                                     HOMER
</b>                         That's tomorrow, Curly. Let's mot 
                         give the story away.

               Homer puts out the lights and leaves the boys in the familiar 
               semi-darkness. Seconds, later, the closed door to the hall 
               is flung open, flooding the room with light from the hall, 
               and Homer, dressed in his long white laboratory coat and 
               looking every inch the doctor, delivers his best imitation 
               of Larch's popular blessing.

<b>                                     HOMER
</b>                         Good night, you Princes of Maine! 
                         You Kings of New England!

               On Copperfield and Steerforth and Curly as the door to the 
               hall is closed and semi-darkness prevails in the room again. 
               Copperfield, smiling, shuts his eyes. After a second, the 
               wide-eyed Steerforth shuts his eyes, too. Then Curly.

               The last to close his eyes is Buster.

</b>
<b>                                         THE END
