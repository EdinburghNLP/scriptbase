When "The Dude" Lebowski is mistaken for a millionaire Lebowski, two thugs urinate on his rug to coerce him into paying a debt he knows nothing about.
While attempting to gain recompense for the ruined rug from his wealthy counterpart, he accepts a one-time job with high pay-off.
He enlists the help of his bowling buddy, Walter, a gun-toting Jewish-convert with anger issues.
Deception leads to more trouble, and it soon seems that everyone from porn empire tycoons to nihilists want something from The Dude.
