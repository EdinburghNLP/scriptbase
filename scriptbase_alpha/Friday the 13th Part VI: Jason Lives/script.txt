FADE IN:
 
              A NIGHT SKY
 
              Ominous black clouds roll across the heavens.  THUNDER begins
              to RUMBLE within the clouds.  An unsettling feeling of
              approaching danger.
 
              VARIOUS FOREST SHOTS
 
              Deep shadowed woods. A quiet breeze rustles some dry leaves.
              NOISY CRICKETS.  Some unseen creature runs through the bush.
              THE CRICKETS STOP.
 
              EXT. FOREST ROAD - NIGHT
 
              A very mangy wild dog feeds on what was once a rabbit run
              over in the road.  ROARING AROUND THE BEND COMES AN OLD FORD
              PICKUP. The terrified canine runs for its life into the woods.
 
              INT. PICKUP
 
              TIGHT ON HOCKEY MASK
 
              We stare down on Jason's infamous mask held in a young man's
              (HAWES) hands.
 
                                  HAWES
                               (Southern accent)
                        I don't know how the hell you
                        talked me into this, Jarvis.
 
              ANGLE ON HAWES
 
              Sitting in the passenger seat examining the mask is ALLEN
              HAWES.  He is a rather unusual-looking guy in his mid-
              twenties, nervously smoking a cigar.
 
                                  HAWES
                        Hell, I must be crazy.  If the old
                        institution ever found out about
                        this...boy, they'd throw our butts
                        back in an' strait-jacket 'em
                        permanent.
 
                                  TOMMY (o.s.)
                        You didn't have to come, Hawes...
 
              PRESS IN - ON DRIVER
 
              TOMMY JARVIS is a good-looking young man in his late teens.
              He drives like a bat out of hell, wearing a very intense
              expression of determination.
 
                                  TOMMY
                        This is between me and Jason.

              TWO SHOT ON THEM
 
                                  HAWES
                               (becoming more nervous)
                        Yeah, I know.  But I still don't
                        get the therapy here. Jason's
                        dead, right?  How will seeing his
                        corpse stop your hallucinations?
 
                                  TOMMY
                        Seeing it won't. But destroying
                        him once and for all will. Jason
                        belongs in hell.
 
              TIGHT ON TOMMY
 
                                  TOMMY
                               (coldly)
                        I'm gonna see he gets there.
 
              HAWES
 
              stares wide-eyed at Tommy.  He then turns to look out the
              back window.
 
              EXT. PICKUP
 
              TIGHT ON HAWES' FACE IN REAR WINDOW - TILT DOWN
 
              A huge can of gasoline, a crowbar and two shovels are seen in
              the back of the truck.  THUNDER BEGINS TO RUMBLE LOUDER.
 
              EXT. FOREST ROAD - NIGHT
 
              Dust kicks up as the old pickup races down the road.
              LIGHTNING FLASHES, illuminating the dark woods.  THUNDER
              CRASHES HELLISHLY.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT
 
              TRACKING along a row of tombstones, we follow Tommy and his
              flashlight as he searches.  Hawes follows, carrying the gas
              can, tools and mask. THUNDER continues as a fierce, whistling
              WIND attacks.
 
              Tommy's eyes squint to read each tombstone, looking for the
              one.  LIGHTNING FLASHES.

              WIDER - ON TOMMY
 
              Getting frustrated, but far from giving up, Tommy moves to
              the new row of markers.  Suddenly he freezes and we PRESS IN
              on him.
 
              ANGLE ON JASON'S GRAVE
 
              LIGHTNING illuminates the tombstone that reads "Jason
              Voorhees - At Rest".
 
              TIGHT ON TOMMY
 
              As he stares, a deep terror chills his bones.  Something else
              then catches his eye.
 
              ANGLE ON ANOTHER GRAVE
 
              Close to Jason's marker we see another.  It reads "Pamela
              Voorhees - Beloved Mother."
 
              FULL SHOT ON TOMMY AND HAWES
 
              Returning his attention to Jason's grave, Tommy points "this
              is the one" to Hawes, who gulps and nods.  Putting down the
              other items, the boys take hold of the shovels.  Tommy raises
              his up first.
 
              THE SHOVEL
 
              plunges into the ground.  A LIGHTNING BLAST punctuates it as
              it removes a large chunk of grass and dirt.
 
              CLOSE ON OUR GRAVEDIGGERS
 
              They begin to exhume the legendary killer's body. Tommy works
              feverishly.  Hawes works nervously.
 
              Again and again their shovels strike, digging into the earth.
 
                                                       SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
 
              THE SHOVEL (LATER)
 
              is scraping the dirt of of a rotted coffin lid.
 
              ANGLE UP - ON TOMMY
 
              The sweating boy tosses the shovel out of the shallow grave.
              Hawes silently hands him the crowbar from above.

              TIGHT ON COFFIN
 
              The crowbar is driven into the side.  Tommy's hands take a
              firm grip and yank.  A HORRIFIC CREAK resounds as the lid
              cracks open.
 
              LOW ANGLE - ON TOMMY
 
              He hands the crowbar back to Hawes.  They exchange a look and
              a deep breath.  Tommy then goes for it.  His hands extend
              slowly toward the coffin.  More THUNDER GROWLS.
 
              TOMMY'S FINGERS
 
              slip into the narrow space beneath the coffin lid.
 
              PRESS IN TIGHT ON HAWES' FACE
 
              He winces and bites his lip.
 
              PRESS IN TIGHT ON TOMMY'S FACE
 
              With all the courage he can muster, Tommy strains to do the
              deed.  He yanks the casket open!
 
              ANGLE ON JASON IN COFFIN
 
              With a BRILLIANT FLASH OF LIGHTNING, the lid swings open to
              reveal the huge decomposing body of JASON.  His HEAD IS
              COMPLETELY COVERED BY AN ARMY OF DISGUSTING MAGGOTS.
 
              HAWES GASPS
 
              He fights with his stomach to keep his dinner down..
 
              TOMMY CLIMBS OUT OF GRAVE
 
              He turns and stares down at his nemesis. A slow hatred begins
              to build.  We PRESS IN on Tommy, HEARING his horrid memories:
              His sister screams, NO, TOMMY, NO while 10-year-old Tommy
              kills Jason, repeating, "DIE, DIE!"
 
              TIGHT ON TOMMY
 
              As he listens, his eyes well up with a violent rage.
 
              WIDER
 
              Tommy looks around vengefully.  Seeing an old fence a few
              yards away, he heads for it.  Hawes is confused by his
              actions.
 
                                  HAWES
                        Hey, where are you going?

              TRACK WITH TOMMY
 
              Without a word, he storms over to the rusty fence. He grabs
              one of the spearlike posts and pulls it out.
 
              LOW ANGLE - DOLLY BACK
 
              With fire in his eyes, Tommy stalks Jason with the weapon.
              THUNDER ROARS ABOVE.
 
              HAWES
 
              rushes up to Tommy, greatly alarmed.
 
                                  HAWES
                        What's that for? Tommy, what are
                        you doin', boy?!
 
              The boy storms right past him.
 
              REACHING THE GRAVE
 
              Tommy glares down hatefully at this monster who has destroyed
              his loved ones and his life. Raising the spear, he explodes
              and jumps down.
 
                                  TOMMY
                        You bastard!
 
              LOW ANGLE - ON TOMMY
 
              As he lands in the grave, Tommy plunges the spear down with
              a mighty force. THUNDER AND LIGHTNING BLAST HELLISHLY.
 
              THE SPEAR
 
              penetrates deep into Jason's chest.
 
              ANGLE ON HAWES, DUMBFOUNDED
 
                                  HAWES
                        Oh, shit.
 
              TOMMY
 
              withdraws it, then angrily rams it down again and again.
 
              CLOSE ON JASON'S FACE
 
              The force of the blows causes many of the numerous maggots to
              start dropping off his face. Grossly decayed flesh is
              illuminated the LIGHTNING.

              CLOSE ON TOMMY'S FACE
 
              Exhausted, his rage finally vented, he drives the spear into
              Jason for the last time.
 
              ANGLE DOWN - ON TOMMY AND JASON
 
              Over the boy's shoulder we see the long spear extending out
              of Jason's cold heart.
 
              WIDER
 
              Recovering from his tantrum, Tommy climbs out of the grave.
              Hawes stares open-mouthed at his friend.
 
                                  HAWES
                        Boy, he must've really messed you
                        over.
 
              TOMMY
 
              reaches down, picks up Jason's hockey mask, and stares at it.
 
              INSERT - HOCKEY MASK
 
              It seems to stare back evilly at him.
 
                                  TOMMY (O.S.)
                        Yeah.  Fuck you, Jason.
 
              RESUME TOMMY
 
              Tommy, knowing the nightmare is finally over, tosses the mask
              into the grave.  He then bends down and starts to uncap the
              gas can.
 
              WIDER ON SCENE
 
              Without warning, the sky EXPLODES with a mass of LIGHTNING.
              One of the BOLTS OF ELECTRICITY is drawn to the spear as to
              a lightning rod.  SPARKS fly as the spear is struck and
              electrified.  Tommy and Hawes dive for cover.
 
              TIGHT ON JASON'S FACE
 
              JASON'S DECOMPOSED EYELIDS FLASH OPEN!
 
              ANGLE ON TOMMY AND HAWES
 
              Uncovering their heads, they look skyward in fear.  Quickly,
              Tommy gets to his feet and goes for the troublesome spear.

              ANOTHER ANGLE
 
              The unintended lightning rod is still smoking a little from
              the blast.  He touches it.  It's hot.  He pulls out a pair of
              gloves from his jacket.  Putting them on, he then attempts to
              remove the spear.  He can't get proper leverage.  So Tommy
              jumps down into Jason's grave.
 
              LOW ANGLE - ON TOMMY
 
              He struggles to pull the spear out.  It's apparently driven
              into the bottom of the coffin as well.  Hawes leans down into
              the grave.
 
                                  HAWES
                        Let's just get the hell out of
                        here.  My heart can't take any
                        more of this.
 
              CLOSE ON JASON'S FACE
 
              Jason's wicked eyes glare at Tommy.
 
              RESUME TOMMY
 
              The boy, of course, does not see what's about to occur.  He
              finally yanks the spear out, and throws it up onto the grass.
              Slowly he removes his gloves and tosses them to Hawes.  He
              starts to climb out.  JASON SPRINGS UP FROM BEHIND AND GRABS
              HIM.
 
              CLOSE ON HAWES SCREAMING
 
              He goes crazy with hysteria.  He starts to run.
 
              ANGLE DOWN - ON GRAVE
 
              Tommy fights for his life as Jason tries to pull him down
              into the grave.  He manages to kick Jason back down long
              enough to climb out.
 
              TOMMY
 
              scrambles for the gas can as the STORM CLOUDS DETONATE ABOVE.
              He gets it open, turns around, and starts throwing it on the
              rising corpse of Jason.
 
              ANGLE ON JASON
 
              The gas splashes all over him as he keeps coming!

              REVERSE ON TOMMY
 
              He backs up as Jason stalks him.  Knowing there's enough gas
              now on his predator, he drops the can.
 
              TIGHTER - ON JASON
 
              He's coming closer.
 
              TIGHTER - ON TOMMY
 
              Panicking, he searches his pockets for the matches.  He finds
              them.  As he pulls them out, the STORM CLOUDS ERUPT WITH AN
              INCREDIBLE DOWNPOUR.
 
              JASON
 
              stops as the rain drenches him.  Maggots start to wash off
              him as he stares at his helpless victim.
 
              RESUME TOMMY
 
              He tries desperately to light a match in this pounding rain.
 
              TOMMY'S HANDS
 
              struggling with the soaked matchbook.
 
              JASON
 
              starts to close in.  Suddenly HAWES EMERGES FROM BEHIND,
              HOLDING UP A SHOVEL.  He HOLLERS as he swings it.
 
              ANGLE ON HAWES
 
              He WHACKS the back of Jason's head as hard as he can.  It
              doesn't even faze his undead superkiller.
 
              JASON WHIPS AROUND ON HAWES
 
              His arm lunges forcefully at Hawes' chest.
 
              ANGLE HAWES' BACK
 
              JASON'S HAND, CLUTCHING HAWES' HEART, BURST OUT HAWES' BACK.
 
              ANGLE ON GRAVE
 
              Hawes' body falls back into Jason's grave.
 
              TIGHT ON COFFIN
 
              As Hawes lands in the coffin, the lid shuts over him.

              ANGLE ON TOMMY
 
              Horrified and weaponless, he runs like hell.
 
              LOW ANGLE - ON JASON
 
              Seeing his victim escaping, Jason whips around and looks for
              a weapon.  He goes for the nefarious spear.  Something in the
              grave then catches his attention.
 
              EXT. FOREST ROAD - NIGHT
 
              Tommy races out of the cemetery to his pickup.  He jumps into
              the truck and takes off in the rain.
 
              EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT
 
              With his back to us, Jason dons his beloved hockey mask and
              picks up the spear.  We PRESS IN TIGHT ON HIM as he turns
              around to face us.  FREEZE FRAME.  Meaner, stronger, and more
              unstoppable than ever before...
 
              TITLE PROCLAIMS:  "JASON HAS RISEN"
 
              OPENING CREDITS
 
              FADE IN:
 
              EXT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - NIGHT
 
              Tommy's old pickup SCREECHES UP before us.  He leaps from the
              truck and races for the office door.  The sign by it reads
              "Forest Green County Sheriff's Dept."
 
              INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - NIGHT
 
              Tommy BURSTS into the room.
 
              ANGLE ON SHERIFF BEHIND DESK
 
              SHERIFF MICHAEL GARRIS is a hard-ass Vietnam vet who, at
              forty-three, has "seen enough trouble and don't want no
              more."  That's why he took this job a few years back.  Having
              just nodded off, Tommy's entrance startles him.  He leaps to
              his feet, gun drawn with lightning speed.
 
              REVERSE ON TOMMY
 
              Shocked by the sheriff's sudden aggression, Tommy instantly
              throws up his hands.
 
                                  TOMMY
                        Don't shoot.  Please.

              ANGLE ON SHERIFF
 
              He relaxes, seeing it's just a teenager.  But he's still
              pissed off as he holsters his gun.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        You in show business, kid?  You
                        sure know how to make an entrance.
 
              MOVING SHOT
 
              The hyper boy rushes toward the sheriff.
 
                                  TOMMY
                        You gotta do something!  Jason's
                        alive!  He killed my friend, now
                        he's coming for me!!
 
              EXT. FOREST ROAD - NIGHT
 
              Jason is coming.  Gripping the spear before him, he heads
              toward us.
 
              INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - NIGHT
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (sitting back)
                        Now you better cool out a minute,
                        boy.  You already almost got your
                        head blown to pieces.
 
                                  TOMMY
                               (demanding)
                        Will you listen, dammit!
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (stands up)
                        Don't piss me off, junior.  Or I
                        will repaint this office with your
                        brains.
 
              Tommy tries to control his emotions and sound rational.
 
                                  TOMMY
                        Jason is alive.  We dug up his
                        body.  I was gonna cremate it
                        and...
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (smirks and interrupts)
                        Hold it.  Whoa... What's your
                        name, son?

                                  TOMMY
                               (quickly)
                        Tommy Jarvis.  We gotta do
                        something.  He's even more
                        powerful now that...
 
              The sheriff circles the desk and approaches Tommy.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Aren't you the kid whose mother
                        and friends were....
 
                                  TOMMY
                               (nods)
                        Yeah.  Jason murdered them and...
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (cutting him off again)
                        And you've been at some
                        psychiatric clinic ever since,
                        haven't you?
 
                                  TOMMY
                               (catching his drift)
                        Yes, but they released me
                        because...
 
              The door behind him BURSTS OPEN.
 
                                  DEPUTY
                        Rains stopped.  Ya owe me that
                        five-spot, partner.
 
              ANGLE ON DOORWAY
 
              DEPUTY RICK COLONE hurries in with an armload of fast food.
              Dark, mid-thirties, and a little on the short side.  He is
              surprised to see someone here this late.
 
                                  DEPUTY
                        Sorry.  I didn't...
 
              BACK TO SCENE
 
              Sheriff Garris waves his deputy in.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (sarcastic)
                        No problem, Rick.  Come over and
                        meet a former resident here, Tommy
                        Jarvis.  He's got some kinda prank
                        going about...

                                  TOMMY
                               (explodes)
                        There's no time for this
                        bullshit...
 
              MOVING SHOT - ON TOMMY
 
              He bolts across the office and grabs one of the rifles from
              the rack.
 
                                  TOMMY
                        Jason's got to be stopped.
 
              ANGLE ON GROUP
 
              Both lawmen drive for the crazy kid. Their food flies as they
              struggle to get the rifle away from the strong youth.
 
              Finally the deputy pins Tommy's arms from behind.  The
              sheriff yanks the rifle away.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (pointing at Tommy)
                        Now that's what know in the books
                        as screwin' the pooch.
                               (to deputy)
                        Iron this punk.
 
              Tommy fights to get away from the deputy, who throws him into
              the cell.  The iron bars are slammed shut.
 
                                  TOMMY
                               (struggling)
                        No... Ya gotta listen.  Jason's
                        coming back here.  He's after me.
                        I tried to destroy him but I
                        fucked up....
 
              TIGHT ON SHERIFF
 
              He leans in toward Tommy's cell.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        You got that right.  Now you
                        listen up.  I'm sorry for what
                        happened to you and your folks
                        years ago.  But no one in Forest
                        Green wants to be reminded of what
                        that maniac did here.  That's why
                        they changed the name to Forest
                        Green.  People want to forget this
                        was once Crystal Lake.  And they
                        don't need some kid stirring up
                        Jason shit again.

              RESUME ON TOMMY
 
              He paces the cell in wild frustration.
 
                                  TOMMY
                        Why didn't you cremate him?!
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (impatiently)
                        They were gonna!  But some asshole
                        sent a lot of money to give Jason
                        and his mother a decent burial.
                        Now look, you just lie down and
                        get some rest.  In the morning
                        I'll call that clinic and see if
                        they...
 
              Tommy grabs the bars and pleads with him.
 
                                  TOMMY
                        If you'd just go to the cemetery,
                        you'll see I'm not lying.
 
              CLOSER ON SHERIFF AND TOMMY
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Either you go to sleep or I'll
                        come in there and put you out.
 
                                  TOMMY
                               (defiantly)
                        You're gonna be sorry you didn't
                        listen to me.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (more defiantly)
                        You're gonna be sorry if you don't
                        shut the fuck up.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. FOREST BACK ROAD - NIGHT
 
              A funky VW Bug bounces along a narrow muddy road.  LAUGHTER
              is HEARD from within.
 
              INT. CAR - NIGHT
 
              A likable couple in their mid-twenties are obviously lost.
              LIZBETH drives and giggles, slap-happy from the long trip and
              late hour.  Her boyfriend, DARREN, struggles to read the map
              in the dim car light.  A huge pothole causes him to bang his
              head on the roof.

                                  DARREN
                        Will you slow down?  It's hard
                        enough to read this thing.
 
                                  LIZBETH
                               (trying not to laugh)
                        Well, who told me to take this cow
                        path?
 
                                  DARREN
                        You admit the sign did say "Camp
                        Forest Green," with an arrow
                        pointing this way.
 
                                  LIZBETH
                        I admit nothing without talking to
                        my lawyer.
 
              DARREN
 
              throws down the map with a growl.
 
                                  DARREN
                        So much for the head counselors
                        ever finding the camp on their
                        own.  I say we stop the car, get
                        out, and start screaming for help.
 
              The car comes to a grinding halt.
 
                                  DARREN
                               (sighs)
                        I was just kidding, Lizbeth.
 
              He looks at his girlfriend, who is staring fearfully out the
              windshield.  Darren turns to look.
 
              DARREN'S P.O.V. - OUT WINDSHIELD
 
              Standing in the middle of the road, illuminated by the
              headlights... JASON.  He holds the deadly spear before him.
 
              RESUME COUPLE
 
              Needless to say, Lizbeth is becoming more afraid.
 
                                  LIZBETH
                        Darren, we better turn around.
 
                                  DARREN
                        Why?

                                  LIZBETH
                        Why?  Because I've seen enough
                        horror movies to know masked
                        weirdos are never friendly.
 
              She starts to back up.  Darren looks behind him, then grabs
              the wheel.
 
                                  DARREN
                        Wait!
 
              THE CAR TIRE
 
              almost rolls off the narrow road into a water-filled gully.
 
              ANGLE ON DARREN
 
              He stares intensely at Lizbeth.
 
                                  DARREN
                        There's no way we can do this...
                               (he looks at Jason)
                        ...If the car drops into that
                        gully, we'll never get it out.
 
              JASON
 
              just stands his ground.  He ain't backin' down.
 
              LIZBETH
 
              keeps her eye on the evil-looking stranger.
 
                                  LIZBETH
                        Do you have any alternate
                        suggestions?
 
              ANGLE ON DARREN AND LIZBETH
 
              He bites his lip nervously.
 
                                  DARREN
                        Yeah... We're gonna scare him.
 
                                  LIZBETH
                               (taken aback)
                        We're gonna scare him?!
 
              Darren attempts to pump up a macho attitude.
 
                                  DARREN
                        That's right.  Just drive toward
                        him.  He'll move.  Nobody wants to
                        die.

                                  LIZBETH
                               (staring at Darren)
                        That's a freakin' fact.  Least of
                        all us.
 
                                  DARREN
                        Just drive.  He'll get out of our
                        way.
 
              ANGLE ON LIZBETH
 
              She shakes her head, not believing she's actually going to do
              this.
 
              INSERT - ACCELERATOR
 
              Her foot stomps it down.
 
              THROUGH WINDSHIELD
 
              We race toward Jason, who doesn't budge.
 
              INSERT - BRAKE
 
              Her foot slams on the brakes.
 
              LOW ANGLE - ON HEADLIGHT
 
              The car skids to a stop, inches from the stock-still killer.
 
              LIZBETH
 
              turns to her now-less-than-confident boyfriend.
 
                                  LIZBETH
                               (sarcastically)
                        Yeah, that really scared the shit
                        out of him.
 
              ANGLE ON DARREN
 
              He gets pissed.  He leans over and BLASTS the HORN.
 
              LOW ANGLE - ON JASON
 
              Jason gets pissed too.  He swings the spear and SMASHES OUT
              a headlight.
 
              BACK TO COUPLE
 
                                  DARREN
                               (shocked)
                        Oh, jeez.

                                  LIZBETH
                               (starting to shift)
                        That's it.  We're driving this
                        baby back to town... in reverse.
 
              Darren, now angered, grabs her hand as she starts to shift.
 
                                  DARREN
                        The hell we are.
 
              ANGLE ON GLOVE COMPARTMENT
 
              Darren opens it and pulls out a .22 revolver.
 
              LIZBETH
 
              stares at the gun, then at Darren, in shock.
 
                                  LIZBETH
                        Where'd you get that?
 
              Darren gets out of the car.  He's scared shitless, but tries
              not to show it.
 
                                  DARREN
                        Don't worry about it.  Just stay
                        cool.
 
                                  LIZBETH
                               (trying to maintain)
                        Stay cool?  You ain't Dirty Harry.
                        Now stop it.
 
              JASON
 
              watches Darren's every move.
 
              DOLLY BACK ON DARREN TO JASON
 
              With great apprehension he heads toward Jason, holding the
              gun out with both hands.  He clears his nervous throat.
 
                                  DARREN
                        All right, scumbag.  Get out of
                        the road.
 
              From over Jason's shoulder we see Darren cock the trigger and
              aim.
 
                                  DARREN
                        Now!
 
              Instantly Jason rams the spear into the other headlight!  He
              is now a very dark figure in front of the car.

              LIZBETH
 
              screams, and shouts at her boyfriend.
 
                                  LIZBETH
                        Darren, get in here right now!
                        He'll kill you!
 
              ANGLE ON DARREN
 
              He gets a bit cocky, knowing he's the one with the gun.  He
              glances back at his girl.
 
                                  DARREN
                               (loudly)
                        Not if I get him first.
 
              JASON
 
              suddenly CHARGES him!
 
              ANGLE ON DARREN AND JASON
 
              Darren fires.  But the bullet either misses or it just
              doesn't affect Jason.  He thrusts the spear forward.
 
              THE SPEAR
 
              drives right through Darren's stomach and out his back!
 
              PRESS IN ON LIZBETH
 
              She goes hysterical.
 
              LOW ANGLE - ON JASON
 
              Effortlessly, he lifts up the impaled boy and tosses his limp
              body aside.  Jason then turns his murderous gaze on Lizbeth.
 
              THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
 
              Lizbeth gasps.  Quickly, she tries to drive away.  Seeing
              something coming, she dives across the other seat.  JASON'S
              SPEAR SMASHES THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD AND IMPALES ITSELF INTO
              THE DRIVER'S SEAT.
 
              ANGLE ON LIZBETH
 
              The terrified girl crawls out of the open passenger door.
              She falls into the muddy and water-filled gully alongside the
              road.

              MOVING SHOT - ON JASON
 
              He withdraws his weapon from the car and heads for his victim.
 
              LIZBETH
 
              struggles to stand.  She slips, badly twisting or breaking
              her ankle.  Looking back quickly, she is horrified.
 
              HER P.O.V. - ON JASON
 
              with spear poised, he's coming!
 
              TIGHT ON LIZBETH
 
              Knowing it's hopeless to run, she tries a last-ditch effort
              to barter for her life.  Lying in the muddy water, Lizbeth
              digs into her jacket.  She pulls out her wallet and removes
              her money and credit cards.
 
                                  LIZBETH
                               (crying)
                        Don't kill me, please.  You can
                        have these.
 
              She looks up and offers her valuables.
 
              LIZBETH'S P.O.V.
 
              Jason is gone.
 
              BACK TO LIZBETH
 
              She is amazed.  Where did he go?  What's the difference --
              she's safe.  WRONG.  As she looks behind her, JASON'S FEET
              SLAM DOWN IN THE WATER NEXT TO HER HEAD.  She opens her mouth
              to scream.
 
              LOW ANGLE - UP ON JASON
 
              He raises the spear and RAMS IT DOWN TOWARD HER FACE!  A
              spine-chilling CRUNCH is HEARD.
 
              WIDER
 
              Jason stands over his victim... Her body floats on the filthy
              water, but her head is drive down underneath.  BLOOD begins
              to bubble up around the extended spear.
 
              CLOSE ON HER HAND
 
              A lifeless hand releases the money and credit cards it was
              clutching.

              We follow the floating American Express card along the now-
              bloody stream... Remember, don't leave home without it.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY
 
              Tommy is asleep on the cot in his cell.  Suddenly the LOUD
              SOUNDS of the DOOR OPENING and YOUNG VOICES startle him awake.
 
              MOVING SHOT - ON GROUP
 
              Entering from the bright sunshine are the sheriff and four
              kids in their late teens.  Teasing, holding on to the arm of
              her sheriff father, is MEGAN.  She is a cute and feisty 18-
              year-old.  Her three friends, PAULA, a warm and personable
              girl with a short new-wave haircut; SISSY is black, sexy and
              very boy-crazy; and CORT, with his long hair and heavy metal
              T-shirt, is always ready to rock.
 
                                  MEGAN
                               (to sheriff)
                        Come on, Dad.  You could have Rick
                        drive down Cunningham Road and
                        look for them.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Megan, my deputies have more
                        important things to do than look
                        for camp counselors with car
                        trouble.
 
                                  CORT
                        Sheriff, couldn't you like put our
                        an all-points bulletin for them?
                        That would be really wicked decent.
 
              The sheriff shoots him a look.
 
                                  PAULA
                        It's just that Darren and Lizbeth
                        are in charge of organizing and
                        setting up the new campgrounds.
 
                                  SISSY
                        All the little kids arrive today.
                        We're not ready to deal with that
                        alone.
 
              ANGLE ON SHERIFF
 
              He sits down behind his desk and picks up the phone.

                                  SHERIFF
                        I sympathize with you kids.  The
                        best I can do is call the station
                        in Carpenter and have them keep a
                        lookout for them.
 
                                  TOMMY (O.S.)
                        I got a bad feeling of what
                        might've happened to them.
 
              Everyone turns to look.
 
              TOMMY
 
              is gripping the cell's bars.  His eyes connect with Megan.
 
                                  TOMMY
                        You've got to convince the sheriff
                        to look for your friends.
                        Hopefully, they're fine.  But
                        there's a very good chance that
                        Jason...
 
              THE SHERIFF
 
              jumps up angrily.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Shut up.
 
              Megan, attracted to the good-looking prisoner, walks toward
              his cell.
 
                                  MEGAN
                        Jason who?
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (ordering her)
                        Megan, get away from him.  He's
                        dangerous.
 
              ANGLE ON MEGAN AND TOMMY
 
              She stops a few feet from the cell.
 
                                  TOMMY
                               (sincerely)
                        I'm not dangerous, believe me.
                        Jason is out there.  He's looking
                        for me.  But there's every
                        possibility he'll return to the
                        camp where it all started.

              WIDER ON SCENE
 
              The sheriff stomps over toward Tommy.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (clenching his teeth)
                        I told you to shut...
 
                                  SISSY
                               (nervously)
                        You mean the Jason of Camp Blood?
 
                                  TOMMY
                        Yes!
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        No!...
                               (to kids)
                        ... You kids better leave.  This
                        boy here is not well and I need to
                        talk to him in private.
 
                                  MEGAN
                        But, Dad, we...
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (very firmly)
                        Megan, take your friends back to
                        the camp.  I'll let you know if I
                        hear anything about your
                        counselors.
 
              ANGLE ON MEGAN
 
              She wants to argue, but the look in her father's eye tells
              her she'd better cool it.  She takes one more look at Tommy
              as she approaches her father.
 
                                  MEGAN
                               (wisecracking)
                        Don't beat him up too bad, he's
                        kinda cute.
 
              This really steams the sheriff.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Megan, leave!
 
              BACK TO KIDS
 
              They stumble out awkwardly as Megan struts away with a cool
              Lauren Bacall swagger.

              ANGLE ON TOMMY AND THE SHERIFF
 
              On the door is closed, the steely-eyed sheriff leans in close
              to Tommy's face.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        I was going to call the clinic and
                        have them collect your ass.  But
                        I don't want you around here any
                        longer poisoning my daughter, or
                        anyone else, with your warped mind.
 
                                  TOMMY
                               (extremely concerned)
                        But they have to be warned,
                        Sheriff.  Jason will return to the
                        area that's familiar.  No matter
                        what you call it, it's still Camp
                        Crystal Lake to him.
 
              SHERIFF GARRIS
 
              walks away, not listening to Tommy.  He straps on his holster
              and puts on his coat.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (deadly serious)
                        We're gonna escort you and that
                        shit-pile pickup of yours to the
                        edge of my jurisdiction....
                               (he picks up his rifle)
                        ....Then we'll say goodbye and
                        we'll never see your deranged butt
                        around here again...
                               (he cocks rifle)
                        ...Right?
 
              TOMMY
 
              pushes off the bars in frustration and paces the cell like a
              caged animal.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. FOREST - DAY
 
              A large clump of thick bushes.  Someone's moving behind them.
              We TRACK along, following the rustles.  It stops. We HOLD and
              WAIT.  SUDDENLY THE BUSHES PART ABRUPTLY.  A bespectacled
              little man in Army fatigues and camouflage makeup pokes his
              head out at us.  ROY, wearing protective goggles, looks right-
              left, then hides back in the brush.

              ANOTHER AREA OF THE FOREST
 
              We follow TWO OTHER BUSINESSMEN decked out in green jungle
              fatigues, looking like out-of-shape Rambos.  STAN and LARRY
              are both carrying handguns, watching for any movement around
              them.  They, too, wear goggles.
 
                                  STAN
                               (quietly)
                        Once we nail Roy, that's it.
                        Victory is ours.
 
                                  LARRY
                        This is taking forever.  I'm
                        starving.
 
                                  STAN
                        That's your problem, Larry.
                        That's why your sales are always
                        below quota.  Your instinct to eat
                        is stronger than your instinct to
                        win.
 
                                  LARRY
                               (insulted)
                        My ass.
 
                                  STAN
                        Yeah, that's fat too.
 
              ANGLE OVER JASON'S SHOULDER
 
              He watches motionlessly as the two arguing men pass.  They,
              of course, don't see him.
 
              BACK TO GUYS
 
                                  LARRY
                               (outraged)
                        You become a whole other person
                        when you're out here, Stan.  And
                        I don't like it.
 
                                  STAN
                               (arrogant)
                        This is a man's game.  Requiring
                        a man's cunning and intelligence...
 
              SUDDENLY, A FIGURE EXPLODES OUT OF THE BRUSH.
 
              ANGLE ON STAN AND LARRY
 
              They react in terror.

              LOW ANGLE
 
              A goggle-wearing woman, also in Army fatigues, has her
              revolver pointed at them.  KATIE fires at them.
 
              BOTH GUYS
 
              are splattered by red-paint pellets.  Boy, are they pissed.
 
              KATIE
 
              grins triumphantly.
 
                                  KATIE
                        ....with a woman's touch.
 
              WIDE ON GROUP
 
                                  STAN
                        Now wait a second!  I thought Burt
                        shot you.
 
                                  KATIE
                               (turns all around)
                        See any paint?...
                               (cocky)
                        ...Sorry, guys, I did in Mr.
                        Commando.  Survival is the name of
                        the game, and that flag is mine.
 
              As they walk away, Larry looks at his paint-smeared chest.
 
                                  LARRY
                               (to Stan)
                        Never should've let her play.
 
                                  STAN
                        It's a damn company executive
                        game, and she's a damn company
                        exec.
 
                                  KATIE
                               (motherly)
                        Now, now, boys.  Don't be
                        spoilsports.
 
              JASON
 
              silently watches.  He then heads for them!

              EXT. CAMP FOREST GREEN - DAY
 
              The freshly painted and beautifully renovated cabin retreat
              gleams in the bright sunlight.  Even the lake itself shimmers
              tranquilly, free of any memories of its horrid past.
 
              Megan, Cort, Paula, and Sissy carry food supplies from their
              car to the cabin.
 
                                  PAULA
                        I'm getting worried.

                        No...about Darren and Lizbeth.
                        They should have at least called.
                        Don't you think, Megan?...Megan.
 
              Megan's mind is definitely on something--or someone--else.
 
                                  MEGAN
                               (breaking out of it)
                        Huh?  Yeah, what?
 
                                  SISSY
                               (giggles)
                        This girl's back in the cell with
                        her prisoner of love.
 
              Megan hits her playfully.
 
                                  MEGAN
                        What's it to ya?
 
                                  SISSY
                        Don't be playin' with no crazy
                        jailbird.  Those dudes are bad
                        news.
 
                                  MEGAN
                        Yeah?  How would you know?
 
                                  SISSY
                        I've been around long enough...to
                        see plenty on TV.
 
              Everyone laughs or groans at Sissy.
 
                                  PAULA
                        I don't know, Megan.  He seemed
                        pretty weird with all that Jason
                        stuff.

                                  CORT
                        Yeah, he was really into it.
 
                                  MEGAN
                               (playing with them)
                        Maybe he was telling the truth.
 
              Everyone stops and stares at her in disbelief.
 
                                  MEGAN
                               (keeping the ruse going)
                        Just because our parents keep
                        telling us that Jason was only a
                        legend, doesn't mean it wasn't
                        true.  What if Jason did come back
                        here...
                               (dramatically)
                        ...And you know what today's date
                        is, don't you?
 
              ANGLE ON HER THREE FRIENDS
 
              Each of their faces registers a different expression,
              wondering if Megan is serious or not.
 
              MEGAN
 
              looks past them at something, then smiles.
 
                                  MEGAN
                               (slyly)
                        I can think of only one thing even
                        more terrifying.
 
                                  CORT
                               (nervously)
                        What?
 
              She points behind them.  They turn to look.
 
              A BIG YELLOW BUS
 
              pulls up into the camp.  The doors fly open.  A group of
              screaming youngsters pile out.
 
              THE COUNSELOR
 
              stare in dread.  How are they gonna handle this?
 
                                  SISSY
                        I think I'd rather deal with ol'
                        Jason.

              A MACHETE IS SEEN.  We follow the deadly weapon as it's
              carried through the woods.  Reaching some heavy brush, it
              hacks away at it.
 
              WIDER ANGLE REVEALS
 
              BURT, a real Rambo/Commando clone in paint-splattered
              fatigues, whacks angrily at the brushes.  Of all the would-be
              hunters, he looks like he takes the game almost too
              seriously.  He wears a commando belt loaded with a survival
              knife, devil darts and his machete sheath.  Like his
              partners, he too is a sore loser.  As he hacks away, he
              mumbles curses about this "stupid game."
 
              He raises the machete higher as he attacks the defenseless
              bushes.  SUDDENLY, A HORRIBLY DISFIGURED HAND GRABS HIS HAND,
              STOPPING THE MACHETE IN MID-SWING.
 
              Shocked, Burt whips around, and gasps at the masked Jason.
 
              ANGLE ON MACHETE
 
              Jason's iron grip turns the hunter's hand with the machete
              toward his bug-eyed face.  Jason forces the helpless man to
              stare at the weapon in his own hand that's about to take his
              life.  He then PLUNGES the razor-sharp blade through his neck!
 
              GROUND LEVEL
 
              Burt's corpse drops before us.  The gaping wound through his
              throat bubbles out bloody air bubbles.  His eyes stare
              lifelessly at us.

              LOW ANGLE - UP ON MARTIN
 
              The crusty old CARETAKER stares down in utter horror. His
              bloodshot, alcoholic eyes widen at what they see.
 
                                  MARTIN
                        Oh, shit.  Shit-SHIT!
 
              WIDER
 
              He stands over Jason's dug-up grave, cursing at what has
              happened.

              ANGLE ON MARTIN
 
              Taking out a pint of Whiskey from his coat, he takes a strong
              slug and winces.  With hangover equilibrium, he paces,
              nervous and afraid.
 
                                  MARTIN
                        Oh-hh.  Why me?...I know he's
                        gonna blame me for this.
 
              Martin looks around quickly.  He decides to cover up the open
              grave.  He starts throwing all the evidence into the hole,
              then, grabbing the shovel, begins filling it in.
 
                                  MARTIN
                               (become more frightened)
                        Damn.  Why Jason?  Mothers could
                        have their pick...
                               (he gestures)
                        ...of any of these other graves.
 
              ANGLE DOWN ON OPEN GRAVE
 
              Shovel-loads of dirt and mud slam down on the coffin. Hawes'
              foot is seen sticking out of the casket.
 
                                  MARTIN (O.S.)
                        Shitheads couldn't even stick him
                        back in right.  Well, I ain't
                        gonna touch the slimy sucker.
 
              CLOSE ON MARTIN
 
              He's beginning to sweat as he works faster.
 
                                  MARTIN
                        He can't find out.  He'll think I
                        ain't doin' my job.  I need that
                        money...He won't find out...

              REAR-VIEW MIRROR
 
              Sheriff Garris and his deputy, Rick, are following close
              behind in their police car.

              INT. SHERIFF'S CAR
 
              Keeping a stern eye on Tommy, the sheriff shakes his head.

                               (to deputy)
                        It's kinda frightening to think
                        that a kid like that can go so far
                        over the edge.  Jason really
                        screwed up the poor sonofabitch's
                        mind.

                        He really believes Jason's still
                        alive, doesn't he?

                        But that's no what worries me the
                        most...It's how far he'll go to
                        try and prove it.

              assassins.
 
              WIDE ON SCENE
 
              In his ill-fighting fatigues, he dashes comically from behind
              one tree to another.  His foot catches in some vines and he
              takes a terrific pratfall.  The paint-pellet gun flies from
              his hand and vanishes into the fallen leaves.
 
              ANGLE ON ROY
 
              He scrambles on his hands and knees to find his weapon.
              Panicking he'll be seen and shot, Roy starts to whimper as he
              searches.

                                                       CUT TO:
 
              BURNED-OUT AREA OF THE FOREST
 
              A fire some time ago has blackened the trees and ground in
              this area.  Katie, Stan and Larry walk along, looking for
              their missing players.  Holding up the other team's flag
              victoriously, Katie hollers out:
 
                                  KATIE
                        Come on, you guys!  The game's
                        over!!
 
                                  STAN
                               (disgruntled)
                        You don't know for sure.  What
                        about Roy?  Nobody's seen him.
 
                                  KATIE
                               (cocky)
                        Of course not.  If he hasn't
                        already accidentally pelleted
                        himself, I'm sure he's lost.
 
                                  STAN
                        Yeah, but the game's not over
                        until it's over.
 
                                  LARRY
                               (going along)
                        That's right.
 
              Katie starts to counter, when she thinks she hears something.
              She stops them abruptly.
 
                                  KATIE
                        Shh-hh.  Wait a second.  What was
                        that?
 
              Everyone freezes, listening very intently.  A LONG WAIT.
 
              HIGH ANGLE - LOOKING DOWN ON THEM
 
              All three stand stock-still, looking around and listening.
 
              TIGHT THREE SHOT
 
              Not hearing a thing, Stan relaxes.

                                  STAN
                        Ahh, nothing.
 
                                  KATIE
                               (loud whisper)
                        I could swear I heard...
 
              JASON SLAMS DOWN BEFORE THEM.
 
              REVERSE OVER THEIR SHOULDER
 
              Jason wants to play army, too.  He quickly withdraws the
              machete from his newly acquired commando belt.  With one
              violent slice, the blade slashes their throats.
 
              CLOSE ON ALL THREE FACES AND NECKS
 
              The razor-sharp machete opens up all three throats almost
              simultaneously.  It happens so fast, they barely have time to
              even gasp.
 
              REVERSE ANGLE
 
              THREE HANDS DROP OFF, FOLLOWED BY COLLAPSING BODIES.  Jason
              watches them fall, then looks up at something.
 
              JASON P.O.V.
 
              Terrified beyond belief is Roy!  He stands a few yards away
              in a small clearing.
 
              MOVING SHOT - ON JASON
 
              He wastes no time as he stalks the final hunter.
 
              PRESSING IN ON ROY
 
              So incredibly frightened, he doesn't think as he raises his
              gun at Jason and fires.
 
              ANGLE ON JASON
 
              The blood/red-paint pellet makes a direct hit on Jason's
              chest.  He stops and glances down at this annoying mess.
 
              CLOSE ON HIS MASKED FACE
 
              As he looks up at Roy, he is even more pissed off.  He LUNGES
              for him.
 
              ROY
 
              screams, drops the gun, and runs for his life.

              TRACKING SHOT - ON JASON
 
              He is hell-bent on catching this nerd.
 
              DOLLYING BACK - ON ROY
 
              Tears of terror are welling up as the poor guy races.  Jason
              is seen a short distance behind, machete poised and ready.
              Roy glances back quickly, then screams as he heads through
              the ugly charred forest.
 
                                  ROY
                        Oh, God, help me!  Somebody,
                        help!!  He's trying to kill me!!
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              SIGN: "ETERNAL REST CEMETERY"
 
              EXT. FOREST ROAD - DAY
 
              We are TRAVELING toward the large sign and arrow pointing
              left.
 
              INT. PICKUP
 
              Tommy stares at the sign and the approaching turnoff.  He
              glances up in his rear-view mirror again.  Biting his lip, he
              decides to go for it.
 
              EXT. FOREST ROAD
 
              Tommy's pickup makes a sudden left turn and heads up the road
              toward the cemetery.
 
              INT. SHERIFF'S CAR
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (exploding)
                        Fuckin' A, what'd I tell ya!...
                               (to deputy)
                        ...Hit the noise and cherries.
 
              Rick turns on the siren and the red lights.
 
              EXT. FOREST ROAD
 
              The police car SCREECHES left and roars after Tommy.
 
              INT. PICKUP
 
              Tommy gets nervous hearing the siren BLARING, but instead of
              pulling over, he speeds up.

              INT. SHERIFF'S CAR
 
              CLOSE ON SHERIFF
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (vengeful)
                        I'm getting real tired of this
                        maniac.
 
                                  DEPUTY
                        Maybe we better call that
                        psychiatric clinic.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (coldly)
                        Better call an ambulance first.
 
              EXT. FOREST ROAD (TOWARD CEMETERY)
 
              The sheriff's car accelerates and gains on the pickup.  The
              high-speed chase continues down the narrow dirt road.
 
              EXT. CEMETERY - MAIN GATE
 
              Tommy's old pickup SKIDS to a stop in front of the open
              gates.  He leaps out of the truck as the sheriff SCREECHES UP
              next to him.  We CRANE UP past the "Eternal Rest" sign as
              Tommy races into the old cemetery.  The sheriff and his
              deputy are running close behind.
 
              EXT. CEMETERY
 
              TOMMY
 
              sprints across the bone yard in the direction of Jason's
              grave.  In his eyes there is now the hope that they'll see
              he's telling the truth.
 
              HIS P.O.V.
 
              We HEAD toward where Jason's open grave was.
 
              DOLLY BACK - CLOSE ON TOMMY RUNNING
 
              He squints his eyes.  Maybe he's in the wrong area.  He slows
              down to look around.  TOMMY IS VIOLENTLY TACKLED BY THE
              SHERIFF.
 
              WIDER
 
              Angry and out of breath, the sheriff pins him down to cuff
              him.  Tommy struggles to get up.

                                  TOMMY
                        I gotta show you Jason's grave.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (clenching his teeth)
                        I've seen it.
 
                                  TOMMY
                               (desperate)
                        Please, Sheriff.  You'll see we
                        dug it up.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE
 
              Finally handcuffing him, the sheriff yanks him to his feet.
              Gripping Tommy's arm with one hand, he points at something.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (sarcastically)
                        Well, he must've got chilly in the
                        night and pulled the dirt back
                        over.
 
              Tommy looks around to where the sheriff is pointing.  The boy
              is astounded by what he sees.
 
              TOMMY'S P.O.V.
 
              About twelve yards away are Jason's and his mother's
              tombstones.  From this distance, it is impossible to tell
              that the chunks of lawn over Jason's grave have been replaced.
 
              ANGLE ON TOMMY AND LAWMEN
 
              Tommy shakes his head in utter disbelief.
 
                                  TOMMY
                        That's not right.  Somebody
                        covered it up...
                               (going toward it)
                        ...I gotta see it...
 
              The sheriff yanks him back.  The deputy pulls his .357
              revolver with a laser scope attached.  He aims at Tommy's
              head.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (very icy)
                        Now see what you've done.  You've
                        made my deputy draw his revolver.
                        That could be a serious headache
                        for you.  He's been dyin' to try
                        out his new mail-order laser scope.

              The deputy presses his gun's grip.  Instantly a tiny, bright
              red beam appears on Tommy's temple.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        It's a damn impressive piece of
                        high-tech weaponry... Wherever the
                        red dot goes... a bullet is sure
                        to follow.
 
              CLOSE ON TOMMY AND LASER BEAM
 
              He stares, fearing for his life, at the stolid deputy.
 
                                  MARTIN
                        What's the problem, Sheriff?
 
              WIDER ON SCENE
 
              The old caretaker rushes awkwardly toward them.  Immediately,
              the sheriff whips Tommy around.  He drags him back toward the
              car as Rick quickly holsters his gun.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Nothing, Martin.  Just a vagrant
                        kid.  We got it under control.
 
              TIGHTER ON GROUP
 
              As they leave, Tommy looks back at the old man.
 
                                  TOMMY
                               (demanding)
                        Who covered up Jason's grave?!
 
              Martin stops abruptly and tries to hide his nervousness.
 
                                  MARTIN
                        What!?  What are you talking about?
 
              The sheriff pulls Tommy along even faster.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Don't concern yourself, Martin.
                        This boy needs treatment.  We're
                        taking care of it.  Sorry for the
                        disturbance.
 
                                  TOMMY
                               (screaming)
                        Jason's not in his coffin!  Hawes
                        is!  Dig it up!  You gotta dig it
                        up!!

              ANGLE ON MARTIN
 
              He watches with extreme uneasiness as Tommy is thrown into
              the back of the squad car.  The deputy gets into Tommy's
              pickup and follows the sheriff's car.
 
              PRESS IN ON MARTIN
 
              Pulling out his near-empty bottle of Jack Daniel's, he downs
              it all.  With a noisy exhale, Martin glances back at Jason's
              grave.
 
                                  MARTIN
                               (mumbles to self)
                        Dig it up?...
                               (he snickers)
                        ...Hell, what kinda butt-hole does
                        he think I am!
 
              PRESS IN ON JASON'S GRAVE
 
              As we TIGHTEN in, the large chunks of rearranged lawn are now
              visible.  We HOLD on Jason's tombstone.

              The little girls sit on two large picnic tables.  Megan
              stands before them.

              Sissy mimes sticking her finger down her throat in disgust.

                                  CORT
                               (trying hard)
                        No, seriously... the Indian scout
                        would arrange the rocks in such a
                        way that like only his fellow
                        Indians would know.  You know,
                        which way he went...
                               (no response)
                        ...You know?
 
              TYEN
 
              leans into another equally bored youngster, BILLY.
 
                                  TYEN
                        If this is as exciting as it gets,
                        we're in big trouble, dude.

              EXT. BURNED-OUT FOREST AREA - DAY
 
              JASON STALKS THROUGH THE BLACKENED WOODS.  He heads toward
              us, wearing a commando belt displaying a knife and devil
              darts, a bloody machete in his hand.  This undead killing
              machine keeps coming.  There's a slight fog moving in as
              night approaches.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. INTERSTATE HIGHWAY - LATE AFTERNOON
 
              Off on the side of the road, Sheriff Garris opens his
              backseat door.  He pulls Tommy out of the vehicle.  Gruffly,
              he turns him around and uncuffs him.
 
              TIGHT ON TOMMY AND SHERIFF
 
              Whipping him back around, the Sheriff grabs him by his shirt
              and pulls him uncomfortably close.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        I don't find it amusing that the
                        nut house you belong in thinks
                        you're responsible enough to leave
                        here unescorted.  In fact, it
                        gripes my ass.
 
              Tommy just stares coldly into his eyes.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (letting him go)
                        You've been damn lucky, pisshead.
                        With all the grief you've caused
                        me and my partner, you should be
                        leaving wearing your balls as
                        earrings.
 
              THE DEPUTY
 
              walks up and slaps Tommy's car keys into his hand.  Tommy
              looks up, down at his keys, then back at the wicked, smiling
              deputy.
 
                                  DEPUTY
                        I think we should do it to him
                        anyway.
 
              The sheriff leans in and taps Tommy's earlobes with his index
              fingers.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Naw.  But if we see ol' Tommy ever
                        again... you can guarantee it.

              WIDER
 
              Both lawmen turn and climb back into their car.  Tommy waits
              there as they pull out and drive away.
 
              REVERSE ON TOMMY
 
              He watches as they disappear down the highway.  Slowly the
              boy's stubborn determination returns.  He rushes toward his
              old pickup.  Behind it, the SUN IS SETTING.

              The campgrounds are peaceful and quiet.  A foggy haze covers
              everything.  As tranquil as it seems, we feel uneasy.  Is
              somebody watching from the woods.
 
              INT. BOY'S DORMITORY CABIN
 
              Two rows of sleeping youngsters in their cots are seen.
 
              INT. GIRL'S DORMITORY CABIN
 
              The same.  The little girls' faces reflect pleasant dreams.
 
              INT. COUNSELOR'S CABIN
 
              Paula and Sissy are seated at a card table, playing the board
              game CLUE.  Paula keeps looking toward the window, troubled
              by something.  Sissy rolls the die and moves her token along
              the board.
 
                                  SISSY
                               (excited)
                        Okay, okay.  I suggest that the
                        crime was committed in the
                        bedroom, by Colonel Mustard, with
                        the knife.

                               (preoccupied)
                        Huh?  Oh, come on, Sis.  I'm
                        tellin' ya, we can't play Clue
                        with just two people.
 
              SLOWLY WE TIGHTEN IN ON THEM
 
                                  SISSY
                        Why not?  I used to play it alone.
                        I love murder games.  Have you
                        ever played The Consulting
                        Detective?

                               (fidgety)
                        No...Did Megan say when she's
                        coming back from her...visit?
 
                                  SISSY
                        Of course not.  She probably took
                        him a loaf of bread with a saw
                        hidden in it.  I still don't get
                        it.  Why him?  I mean, he's cute
                        alright, but...
 
              Paula smirks.
 
                                  PAULA
                               (quickly)
                        Isn't that enough?
 
              Sissy laughs and nods.
 
                                  SISSY
                        You're right.  And for the area,
                        that even makes him overqualified.
 
              Paula then reaches for the phone.  TIGHTEN IN ON HER.
 
                                  PAULA
                        I'm gonna call her at the ol' jail
                        house.  Maybe her dad has found
                        out what happened to Darren and
                        Lizbeth by now...
                               (she starts dialing)
                        ...I can't believe they haven't
                        called.  I say if they're not here
                        by morning, we send all the kids
                        home.  We're not prepared to run
                        this place by ourselves.
 
              SUDDENLY, A CHILD'S HORRIFIED SCREAMS ECHO THROUGH THE CAMP.
 
              ANGLE ON PAULA AND SISSY
 
              Hanging up the phone, Paula races out the door, followed by
              Sissy.
 
                                                       CUT TO:

              WE FOLLOW BEHIND Sissy and Paula as they run in the direction
              of the scream.  We follow them up the steps of the girls'
              dormitory cabin.

              INT. GIRL'S DORMITORY CABIN
 
              As Paula and Sissy burst in, a LITTLE GIRL in pajamas rushes
              toward them.  She points at a cot across the way.
 
                                  LITTLE GIRL
                               (terrified)
                        She saw a monster.
 
                                  PAULA
                        Who did?
 
              ANGLE ON PAULA
 
              She looks to where the little girl is pointing.
 
              PAULA'S P.O.V.
 
              Huddled up on her cot and pressed against the wall is NANCY.
              The sweet-faced nine-year-old is frightened out of her wits.
              Her big blue eyes are filled with tears.
 
              WIDER
 
              Behind Paula and Sissy, the other children stare wide-eyed at
              Nancy.  Paula approaches her gently.
 
                                  PAULA
                               (reassuringly)
                        Hi.  Everything's all right now.
                        We're here.
 
                                  SISSY
                               (awkwardly going along)
                        Yeah, we're here.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE
 
              Paula crouches down next to Nancy's cot.  Sissy stands next
              to her friend.  Nancy has still not stopped trembling.
 
                                  PAULA
                               (softly)
                        So what happened?
 
                                  NANCY
                               (holding back tears)
                        There was this monster.  He was
                        after me.  He wanted to kill me.
 
                                  SISSY
                        Where...?

                                  NANCY
                        Everywhere.
 
                                  PAULA
                               (smiling)
                        You mean you had a bad dream.
 
                                  NANCY
                               (shakes her head)
                        No, he was real.  Like on TV.
 
              CLOSE ON PAULA AND SISSY
 
              In motherly fashion, Paula wipes Nancy's tears and tucks her
              back under the blanket.
 
                                  PAULA
                        Okay, listen...what's your name,
                        sweetie?
 
                                  NANCY
                               (sniffling)
                        Nancy.
 
                                  PAULA
                               (warmly)
                        Well, Nancy, I'm Paula...
                        remember?  This is Sissy, and
                        we're gonna be right out there all
                        night so nothing can hurt you.
                        Okay?...
 
              The child nods tentatively.
 
                                  PAULA
                        ...Good.  So no more bad dreams
                        can come around here, huh?
 
                                  NANCY
                               (faintly)
                        No more.
 
              Paula smiles lovingly at her, then stands.
 
              WIDER
 
              As Paula and Sissy start to leave, Sissy gets cocky
              addressing the others.
 
                                  SISSY
                        Now you all go back to Z-land.
                        We're on the job and ya don't have
                        to worry about shit...

              Paula nudges her for her choice of language.
 
                                  SISSY
                        ...What?  I'm sure they hear worse
                        at home.
 
              REACHING THE DOOR
 
              Paula looks outside, then turns to Sissy.
 
                                  PAULA
                               (quietly)
                        I just realized something.
                        Where's Cort?  I haven't seen him
                        for hours.
 
                                  SISSY
                               (disgusted)
                        I don't know.  He called somebody,
                        then took off.
 
                                  PAULA
                        He didn't say anything?
 
                                  SISSY
                        Yeah, he was gonna check out
                        "things that go bump in the night."
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. MOBILE-HOME CAMPGROUND - NIGHT
 
              A lone RV bounces and pumps to the beat of LOUD ROCK MUSIC
              within.  Surrounded by a heavy fog, bright light beams from
              the windows of the mobile home.  A cord extends from the
              vehicle and is plugged into the power outlet of this isolated
              trailer campground.
 
              INT. MOBILE-HOME - NIGHT
 
              HEAVY-METAL MUSIC BLASTS as Cort and a savagely sexy girl,
              JILL, make love to the beat.  With her on top, Cort is really
              getting his "bump in the night."  He just lies back and
              enjoys he skilled technique.
 
              ANGLE UP - ON JILL
 
              She moans and bites her lip with erotic pleasure, never
              missing a beat with the music.  Jill even bumps and grinds
              perfectly to the song's drum breaks.

                                  JILL
                               (very hot)

                               (panting)
                        ...You gotta keep it up till the
                        end of the song.
 
              CORT
 
              nearing his climactic moment, strains to avoid it.
 
                                  CORT
                               (breathing heavy)
                        I'm tryin'...how much longer?
 
              Jill bends forward, laying her soft breasts on his chest.
              She whispers seductively in his ear:
 
                                  JILL
                        Only ten more minutes.
 
              Poor Cort's eyes widen.  He'll never make it to the final
              chord.
 
              EXT. MOBILE-HOME CAMPGROUND
 
              From a short distance back, we watch the rockin', rollin' RV.
              SUDDENLY, JASON STEPS SHOCKINGLY INTO FRAME.
 
              ANGLE ON JASON
 
              He stands in the foggy woods and watches too.  He doesn't
              like it.  And he moves to do something about it.

              His face contorts wildly as he tries to control his near-
              exploding passion.  He's just about to...
 
              EXT. POWER OUTLET
 
              Jason's hand grabs the cord and tears it out, leaving the
              plug SPARKING in the outlet.

              EXT. MOBILE-HOME
 
              The RV's bright lights, music and bouncing instantly retard
              and CEASE.
 
                                  JILL'S VOICE
                        Oh, fuck.
 
                                  CORT'S VOICE
                               (passion relieved)

              INT. MOBILE-HOME
 
              Dim moonlight spills in through the windows.  Jill jumps off
              Cort and starts to investigate the problem.
 
                                  JILL
                        Wait a second, I'll...

              CORT
 
              sits quickly.

                               (defensively)
                        I thought that was the end of the

                        Great.  Just great.
 
              She stumbles through the RV.  Shivering, she puts on her coat
              and heads to the AC power switch.
 
                                  JILL
                        If this thing is burned out,
                        friggin' Horace will ground my
                        butt.

                        My friggin' stepfather and asshole-
                        in-residence.

              Jill flips the switch a couple times.  Nothing.  She presses
              her face against the window and looks out.
 
              JILL'S P.O.V.
 
              The power cord is seen laying on the ground below.

                        How did that happen?
 
              CORT
 
              has pulled the blankets around himself to fight the cold.
 
                                  CORT
                        What?

                        Go out and plug the cord back in.
 
                                  CORT
                        What?  Who pulled it out?!
 
              Jill stomps toward him.

                               (sarcastically)
                        Smokey the friggin' bear.  I don't
                        know, just do it.

              Nervously, he starts to get dressed.

              The door opens tentatively.  Cort sticks his head out and
              slowly looks around.
 
                                  JILL (O.S.)
                        Will you hurry up!  I gotta get
                        this fuckmobile back before Horace
                        finds out I took it.

                               (jumping out)
                        Alright, alright.
 
              We TRACK with Cort as he walks around the RV, watching
              everything around him.  It's getting tense.

              ANOTHER ANGLE
 
              Apprehensively, Cort approaches the cord and picks it up.  He
              keeps staring out at the surrounding drifting fog.
 
              PRESSING IN ON CORT
 
              Without looking at it, the jittery boy starts to plug in the
              cord.  He then notices the torn-out plug and frayed cord.
              Cort gasps.  He turns to call to Jill.  HE BANGS INTO SOMEONE
              RIGHT BEHIND HIM...it's Jill.
 
                                  JILL

                        ...But unless you wanna look
                        exactly like it, I say we make
                        this place a memory.
 
              Jill looks down at it.

              Close up, the horribly ripped and torn cord end does look
              quite grotesque.
 
              BACK TO JILL
 
              She cans the foggy night and a deadly fear now grips her.
              Slowly, then picking up speed, she follows after Cort.
 
              CORT
 
              has stopped in the RV's doorway.  Jill rushes up, and turns
              to look at what he's staring at.

                        I think someone's out there.

              The woods are still, with the exception of the drifting fog.
              Is that a tree in the shadows, or...?
 
              JILL
 
              pushes him into the mobile home.

              She climbs in, slams the door, and LOCKS it.

              Cort jumps into the driver's seat.  He tries to start the
              car.  IT'S DEAD.  He looks at Jill in terror.
 
                                  CORT
                        This can't be.
 
              Jill shakes her head at him.

                        It isn't.
 
              She calmly turns the power switch over to "BATTERY".
 
              CORT
 
              tries the ignition again.  It starts up.  He grins at her.

                        Are you gonna drive or not?
 
              Quickly he shifts and ROARS backward.  Jill is thrown to the
              floor.  Items fall off the counters.

              Jill is now sent flying back toward the camper.  She lands on

              head.
 
              HER P.O.V.
 
              Cort LAUGHS LOUDLY as he races down the bumpy dirt road.

              tries to control her temper.  Enough things have gone wrong
              tonight without having this idiot destroy her old man's RV.

              The poor sheriff finally blows sky-high.  He throws open the

              The sheriff gets a CALL over the SHORT-WAVE.  Unintimidated

              HEARD.  She sticks her head out the window.  She tries to
              sound authoritative.
 
                                  SISSY
                        All right, who's out there?
 
              PAULA
 
              stirs and awakens halfway.
 
                                  PAULA
                               (sleepily)
                        What's goin' on?

              ANGLE ON SISSY
 
                                  SISSY
                               (a bit nervous)
                        I think somebody's messin' around
                        out there.
 
              Paula smirks, rolls over, and closes her eyes.
 
                                  PAULA
                        It's gotta be Cort.  He loves to
                        scare people...
                               (falling asleep)
                        ...Teach him a lesson.
 
              BACK TO SISSY
 
              She HEARS FOOTSTEPS right below the window.  She thinks, then
              breaks into an impish grin, seeing something.  Sissy quietly
              tiptoes over to the table and picks up her half-consumed can
              of "Cherry Coke."
 
              MOVING SHOT
 
              Sissy, trying not to laugh, sneaks back to the window.  She
              crouches down, then extends the can outside.
 
              CLOSE ON CAN
 
              Her hands turn it over and sticky "Cherry Coke" pours down on
              her victim.  We HEAR IT HITTING SOMEONE.
 
              ANGLE ON SISSY
 
              Quickly she withdraws the can and jumps back from the window.
              Expecting a response, she is surprised not to get one.
              Stifling a laugh, she creeps back toward the window.
 
              DOLLY IN - SLOWLY FOLLOWING SISSY
 
              Tension mounts as she reaches the frame and tentatively peers
              over it.  SHOCKINGLY, JASON SPRINGS UP AND GRABS HER.
 
              PROFILE ANGLE - ON WINDOW
 
              Bottom half of Sissy's body is WHIPPED VIOLENTLY OUT THROUGH
              THE WINDOW.
 
              PAULA AWAKENS
 
              just as Sissy's legs fly out through the window.

                                  PAULA
                               (groggy)
                        Hey, you guys.  Try got to wake
                        the kids.
 
              Paula listens.  She HEARS a STRUGGLE, a WHOOSH, a THUMP, then
              SILENCE.  She snickers once again, then falls back into
              dreamland.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT
 
              Megan's orange Camaro SCREECHES UP.  We FOLLOW as she jumps
              out and is met by Tommy.
 
                                  TOMMY
                               (adamantly)
                        I'm gonna borrow your car.  You
                        can't do this with me.  It's much
                        too dangerous.
 
              She looks past him at his pickup.
 
                                  MEGAN
                        And you can't leave that truck out
                        in plain sight.  Talk about
                        dangerous.
 
              Tommy turns around to look.
 
                                  TOMMY
                        What?
 
                                  MEGAN
                        Hide it behind the gas station.
                        Then we can get the hell out of
                        here.
 
              He turns back to her.
 
                                  TOMMY
                               (irritated)
                        Look, this isn't a game.  You're
                        not going with me.  I'm already
                        responsible for causing the death
                        of...
 
              Megan cuts him off.
 
                                  MEGAN
                               (quickly)
                        Didn't you say you needed some
                        supplies to do this?

                                  TOMMY
                        Uh...yes.  But...
 
                                  MEGAN
                               (firmly)
                        Then let's get goin'.  We can
                        argue on the way.  You tell me
                        what you need...
                               (with a sly smile)
                        ...I'll make sure you get in.
 
              She heads toward her LOUDLY PURRING Camaro.
 
                                  MEGAN
                        ...And nobody drives this baby but
                        me...
                               (pointing)
                        ...Now get that pickup hid and
                        let's boog.
 
              ANGLE ON TOMMY
 
              There isn't much he can say.  With an exasperated sigh, he
              runs to move his truck.

              SLOWLY we TRACK along a row of sleeping children.  Each has

              We FOLLOW Jason's evil shadow as it crosses more sleeping
              kids.  When it falls across little Nancy, her half-open eyes

              PRESS IN on her.

              As they round the bend, two police cars with lights a-

              The Camaro fires past us.  One cop car, then the other,
              follow suit.  All three vehicles' tires SQUEAL on the
              hazardous curves.

              Megan's wild driving causes his head to roll around in her
              lap.  He tries to be discreet about where it keeps landing.
 
                                  MEGAN (O.S.)
                        That's what I want.
 
              Tommy registers surprise.

              Two signposts are seen.  One reads "Cunningham Road," the
              other "Camp Forest Green" with an arrow pointing right.

              Her car SCREAMS around the turn onto Cunningham Road.
              SHOCKINGLY, HER FATHER AND HIS CAR ARE WAITING IN THE DARK
              FOR THEM.  The deputy and his car are right behind the
              sheriff.  Both have their rifles aimed and ready.
 
              EXT. FOREST ROAD
 
              Megan's car barely has enough room to brake.  The Camaro
              fishtails to a stop.  The sheriff remains stock-still, not
              flinching at all.
 
              PRESS IN - ON SHERIFF
 
              With a deadly cool, her orders his daughter:

              ANGLE ON MEGAN - THROUGH WINDSHIELD
 
              She stares in horror at her father.  She's never seen him
              point a gun at her.  But then again she's never pulled a
              stunt like this.  Megan then looks down at her feet.

              He is sprawled across the floorboard, his face between

                                  MEGAN
                        It's all over.
 
                                  TOMMY
                               (shaking his head)
                        It's just beginning.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. CAMP FOREST GREEN - NIGHT
 
              SUBJECTIVE MOVING CAMERA
 
              We HEAD across the campgrounds toward the counselors' cabin.
              Climbing the steps, we slowly open the door.
 
              INT. COUNSELOR'S CABIN
 
              Paula is sound asleep.  The SOUND of the DOOR OPENING causes
              her to stir.
 
              SUBJECTIVE MOVING CAMERA
 
              We CONTINUE through the door into the cabin.  Looking around,
              we spot the sleeping counselor.  We HEAD for her.
 
              PRESS IN - ON PAULA
 
              Tension builds as we stare at the restless girl.  Sensing
              someone over her, Paula opens her eyes.  She gasps!
 
              PAULA'S P.O.V.
 
              A bloody machete is held out before us.
 
              WIDER
 
              Little Nancy stands over Paula, holding the machete.

                                  NANCY
                        I can't sleep, Paula.  I'm scared.
                        I saw someone at the window and...
 
              Paula sits up quickly and grabs the disgusting machete.
 
                                  PAULA
                               (interrupting)
                        Where'd you get this?
 
                                  NANCY
                               (pointing)
                        I found it outside.
 
              Paula doesn't know what to think.  Looking around the cabin
              and not seeing anyone, she draws some rapid conclusions.
 
                                  PAULA
                               (trying to sound comforting)
                        You know what?  Sissy and Cort are
                        playing jokes.  You know, trying
                        to scare each other.
 
                                  NANCY
                               (innocently)
                        Why?
 
                                  PAULA
                        Well, grown-ups think it's funny
                        to be scared.
 
                                  NANCY
                               (confused)
                        Are they grown-ups?
 
                                  PAULA
                        That's debatable.
 
                                  NANCY
                               (more confused)
                        Huh?
 
              Paula shakes her head, puts the machete down on the floor,
              and stands up.
 
                                  PAULA
                        Never mind...
                               (looks at watch)
                        ...Is it that lake already?
 
              She grabs the phone and starts to dial.

                                  PAULA
                        I can't believe no one called
                        back.  I better...
 
                                  NANCY
                        Who ya calling?
 
              PAULA
 
              realizes the child doesn't need to hear this conversation.
              She hangs up.
 
                                  PAULA
                        Why don't we first try and find
                        Sissy and Cort, then you can go to
                        sleep.
 
              She takes Nancy's hand and they head for the door.
 
                                  NANCY
                               (worried)
                        But what if they try and scare us?
 
                                  PAULA
                               (playfully)
                        We'll scare 'em right back.
 
              Nancy giggles with delight.  They exit the cabin door.
 
              EXT. CAMP FOREST GREEN
 
              Paula leads Nancy down the steps.  She makes a game out of
              quietly sneaking around, looking for the missing counselors.
              For the child, this is fun.
 
              WITHOUT WARNING, JASON'S MASKED FACE IS BEFORE US.  A STING
              accompanies this SHOCK CUT.
 
              OVER JASON'S SHOULDER
 
              In the dark shadows, Jason watches the two giggling girls.
              He waits for his moment.  For Jason, this is fun.

                               (restraining his rage)

                        We have!  Trying to track you
                        down.  The phone there is

                                  TOMMY
                        Doesn't that tell you something?!
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Yeah...They should've paid their
                        bill.
 
              In the background we HEAR a CALL coming in on the radio.
              Deputy Colone is HEARD answering it.  The sheriff points at
              Tommy.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (icy hatred)
                        You just sit tight, Jason.  Once
                        the authorities from Carpenter get
                        here, you'll...

                        Sheriff, you better take this.
 
              We TRACK with the sheriff over to the deputy on the radio
              headset.
 
                                  SHERIFF

                                to the horrible news)
                        ...Approximately what time?
                               (he glares in Tommy's
                                direction)
                        ...I'll be right there.
 
              We FOLLOW the sheriff as he grabs his coat and hat to leave.
              Megan runs up to him.
 
                                  MEGAN
                        What?...What happened?!
 
              Her father looks past her to his deputy.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (coldly)
                        Rick.  Keep and eye on our wacko
                        kid.  I'll be back as soon as I
                        can.

                                  SHERIFF
                               (to Rick)
                        And make sure my daughter stays
                        put...
                               (looking at Megan)
                        ...She's grounded.
 
              Megan steps in his path as he turns to go.  She pushes
              against his chest as hard as she can.
 
                                  MEGAN
                               (exploding)
                        Tell me!!
 
              The sheriff immediately raises his hand to strike her.  Then,
              quickly controlling himself, he grabs her by the shoulders.

                                  SHERIFF
                               (clenching teeth)
                        They just found your friend Cort
                        and some girl.  She was brutally
                        strangled, and Cort...he had a
                        knife rammed through his skull.
 
              Megan shakes her head in disbelief.
 
                                  MEGAN
                        No.  No, it's not...
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Yes, Megan.  Tommy Jarvis is a
                        killer.  A very deranged boy who
                        wants you to believe that...
 
              ANGLE ON TOMMY
 
                                  TOMMY
                        Jason did do it.  I swear!
                        Sheriff, when were they murdered?
 
              BACK TO MEGAN AND SHERIFF
 
              He disregards Tommy's question and stares at his daughter
              with sincere concern.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        For God's sake, stat away from
                        him.  Please, Meggie.
 
              As he starts again to leave, Megan, still in shock from the
              news, grabs her father's arm.
 
                                  MEGAN
                               (intensely)
                        Dad...What time were they murdered?
 
              The sheriff hesitates, not wanting to answer.  Somehow it
              blurts out:
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        They think somewhere around 8:30
                        or 9:00.
 
              MEGAN
 
              steps right up to her father.
 
                                  MEGAN
                        I was with Tommy all that time.

              CLOSE ON SHERIFF
 
              This obviously hits him on more than one level.  He masks his
              reaction, turns, and heads for the door.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Rick, I'll call you when I get
                        there.
 
              He exits and slams the door.
 
              MEGAN
 
              with sorrowful eyes, looks back at Tommy.
 
              TOMMY
 
              slams both fists against the bars.
 
                                  TOMMY
                        Damn.

                        in their cabins.  So you just go

                        got scared?

                        I would close my eyes and say a
                        little prayer.  And pretty soon,
                        you know what?  Everything scary
                        went away...

                               (lovingly)
                        Good night.  See ya in the morning.
 
              REVERSE ON PAULA
 
              As she stands up, we see JASON GLARING AT THEM THROUGH THE
              WINDOW.  Paula smiles tenderly at Nancy.
 
              PAULA'S P.O.V.
 
              Nancy smiles back at her, rolls over, and closes her eyes.
 
              TRACKING SHOT - ON PAULA
 
              She begins to quietly head for the door.  JASON FOLLOWS RIGHT
              ALONG OUTSIDE FROM WINDOW TO WINDOW.
 
              EXT. CAMP FOREST GREEN
 
              Paula exits the dormitory door as silently as possible.  She
              looks around the area, still very concerned about her
              companions.
 
              PAULA'S P.O.V.
 
              A gently breeze is blowing away the evening fog.  The trees
              and brushes seem to shiver nervously.
 
              PRESS IN - ON PAULA
 
              as she slowly descends the steps.  Somehow she can sense her
              deadly face.  Paula looks around again, then hurries toward
              her cabin.
 
              WIDE ON SCENE
 
              Paula races across the camp to the counselor's cabin.
 
              MOVING SHOT - OVER HER SHOULDER
 
              She rushes up the cabin steps and finds the door closed.  She
              seems relieved.
 
                                  PAULA
                        Sissy?

              INT. COUNSELOR'S CABIN
 
              As Paula enters, she is disappointed to find it empty.
 
              TIGHTEN ON PAULA
 
              She hurries to the phone and starts dialing.  For the first
              time, she realizes the phone is dead.  Her frustration turns
              to alarm when she notices something at her feet.
 
              PAULA'S P.O.V.
 
              THE MACHETE SHE LEFT ON THE FLOOR IS GONE.  BLOODY STAINS ON
              THE FLOOR MARK WHERE IT HAD LAIN.
 
              PAULA
 
              hears a NOISE and turns to look.
 
              ANGLE ON OPEN DOOR
 
              It moves a bit.  Was it the wind or is someone behind it?
 
              MOVING SHOT - ON PAULA
 
              Not sure if it's a joke or her imagination, Paula slowly
              heads towards it.  Tension mounts.  Just as she reaches it,
              she slowly extends her hand to grab the knob.  SUDDENLY, THE
              WIND BLOWS IT TOWARD HER.  She backs up.  It slams shut.  No
              one, of course, is there.  She giggles at herself and reopens
              the door.  JASON IS RIGHT THERE IN THE DOORWAY.

              TIGHT ON JASON'S MACHETE AS IT ADVANCES
 
              EXT. CAMP FOREST GREEN
 
              A few yards from the cabin, we watch as Jason quickly lunges
              at Paula and SLAMS the door, MUFFLING her SCREAM.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - NIGHT
 
              Deputy Colone is hunched over his desk, doing what he hates
              most...filling out reports.  He glances up at Tommy, then
              over at Megan.  Satisfied, he returns to his shitwork.
 
              ANGLE ON MEGAN
 
              Seated across the room, she appears to be idly sketching
              something on a large pad.

              TOMMY
 
              sits on his jail cot, head in hands, hopeless.
 
              MEGAN
 
              looks up at the deputy, then over at Tommy.
 
              CLOSE ON TOMMY
 
              He glances up at her.
 
              OVER MEGAN'S SHOULDER - ON TOMMY
 
              She holds up the sketch pad for him to read.  As she does,
              his eyes widen, amazed at what she's written.  He mouths "Are
              you sure?" as she lowers the pad.
 
              TIGHT ON MEGAN
 
              She nods a strong affirmative.
 
              WIDE ON SCENE
 
              Tommy gets up off his cot and stretches nonchalantly.  He
              eyes the deputy, then Megan.  She flips a page over, and
              starts to really sketch.
 
                                  TOMMY
                        So what are ya drawin'?
 
                                  MEGAN
                        What's it to ya?
 
              THE DEPUTY
 
              looks up, irritated by the noise.
 
                                  DEPUTY
                        Hey, pipe down, Jarvis.
 
              TOMMY
 
              grabs the cell bars.
 
                                  TOMMY
                        I was just curious about what she
                        was drawin'.
 
              MEGAN
 
              holds it up for Tommy to see.

                                  MEGAN
                               (sarcastic)
                        There...Ya happy?
 
                                  TOMMY
                        No.
 
                                  MEGAN
                        Why?
 
                                  TOMMY
                        'Cause it stinks.
 
              Megan throws the sketch pad at him.  It bounces off the bars.
 
              ANGLE ON TOMMY
 
              He reaches down, grabs it, and pulls it into his cell.
 
              MEGAN
 
              stands up defiantly.
 
                                  MEGAN
                        Okay, give it back.
 
                                  TOMMY
                               (slyly)
                        Come and get it.
 
              ANGLE ON DEPUTY
 
              This is really getting him pissed.  He gets up.
 
                                  DEPUTY
                        Bastard...Megan, I'll get in.
 
              MEGAN
 
              is already in front of the wall.  She reaches through the
              bars for the pad.
 
                                  MEGAN
                        Give it to me, punk.
 
              TIGHT ON TOMMY AND MEGAN
 
              Suddenly he grabs her arm, pulls her to the bars, and starts
              kissing her passionately.  The more she struggles, the
              tighter he envelopes her.

              MOVING SHOT - ON DEPUTY
 
              He races across the room.  Awkwardly, he grapples to separate
              them.
 
              INSERT - DEPUTY'S REVOLVER
 
              As they battle, Megan's hand secretly reaches down and pulls
              the gun from the deputy's holster.
 
              ANGLE ON GROUP
 
              Megan allows herself to be torn from Tommy's embrace.  The
              angry deputy reaches at Tommy, who backs away into the cell.
 
                                  DEPUTY
                        You stinkin' maggot, I oughta...!
 
                                  MEGAN (O.S.)
                               (demanding)
                        Let him out of there.
 
              PRESS IN - ON DEPUTY
 
              As he turns to face Megan, a red laser dot appears on the tip
              of his nose.
 
              DEPUTY P.O.V.
 
              Megan points the laser-scoped revolver right at us.  She
              definitely means business.
 
              TIGHT ON DEPUTY
 
              He chuckles in disbelief.
 
                                  DEPUTY
                        Come on, Megan, don't clown around.
 
              MEGAN
 
              holds the gun dead-steady.
 
                                  MEGAN
                        I ain't the one with the funny red
                        nose...Open the cell and exchange
                        places...with him...
                               (she cocks the trigger)
                        ...Now.
 
              ANGLE ON DEPUTY AND TOMMY
 
              The boy moves up behind him and reinforces the seriousness of
              the situation.

                                  TOMMY
                               (enjoying this)
                        Better do as she says, 'cause
                        ...wherever the red dot goes, a
                        bullet is sure to follow.
 
              The deputy reluctantly removes his keys and turns toward
              Tommy.
 
                                  DEPUTY
                               (furiously)
                        You brainwashed her, you
                        sonofabitch?
 
              MEGAN
 
              breaks into a cocky smile, and answers for him.
 
                                  MEGAN
                        Yeah, something like that.

              EXT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - NIGHT
 
              Tommy and Megan fly out the door and race toward the Camaro.
 
                                  TOMMY
                        Got the keys?
 
              MEGAN
 
              reaches under the car and quickly withdraws a tiny box.
 
                                  MEGAN
                        No, he took 'em...But I got my
                        Hide-a-Key.
 
              TOMMY
 
              rushes up and grabs it from her.
 
                                  TOMMY
                        Sorry, Megan.  Not this time.
 
                                  MEGAN
                               (pissed)
                        Wait a minute. I just...
 
                                  TOMMY
                               (determined)
                        I thank you for getting me out.
                        But I gotta finish what I started.

              MEGAN
 
              stares defiantly at him as she opens the driver's door and
              gets in.  She suddenly slides over to the passenger's seat.
 
                                  MEGAN
                        Well, come on, hot lips, let's go.
                        You drive, I'll navigate.
 
              ANGLE ON THEM IN CAR
 
              Tommy throws up his hands, then climbs in.  The car starts up
              and ROARS down the street.

              TRACKING ALONG BED - ON LITTLE GIRLS
 
              Slumbering soundly, they have no awareness of the monster at
              the edge of their beds.
 
              JASON
 
              reaches the end of the dormitory.  With his back to us, he
              stops, senses something, and whips around.
 
              TIGHT ON JASON'S MASKED FACE
 
              He glares at someone with evil intent.
 
              PRESS IN WHILE ZOOMING OUT - ON NANCY
 
              The terrified child's eyes peek from under the sheet.  She

              Jason stands and stares at Nancy at the other end of the
              cabin.  He then stalks her.

              up behind it.  The wind is getting stronger as it whips
              through the trees.

              MOVING SHOT - DOWN TOWARD NANCY
 
              The child squeezes her eyes shut and begins to pray, very
              quickly:

              The two officers take out their flashlights.  They spread out
              and scan the area.  The RAGING wind causes everything to
              WHISTLE and move.

              KNOCKING is HEARD on it.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Girls?  It's Sheriff Garris.
 
              Slowly he opens the door and sticks his head in.
 
              PRESS IN SHOCKINGLY - ON HIS FACE
 
              He is horrified!
 
              The entire room is SPLATTERED WITH BLOOD.  It drips from the
              ceiling and streaks down the walls.
 
              BACK TO SHERIFF
 
              Quickly, he bolts out of the room.

              The sheriff races down the steps and heads for the children's
              dormitories.

              Officer Thornton's flashlight scans the two boats along the

              Although we can't see anyone in the WIND-RUSTLED bushes, we
              sense Jason is watching the lone cop.
 
              TIGHT ON JASON'S COMMANDO BELT
 
              His hand withdraws a long, razor-sharp devil dart.
 
              ANGLE ON OFFICER
 
              With his back to us, the unsuspecting cop concludes his
              search of the landing and turns around.  His flashlight now
              focuses on the woods before him.
 
              PAN ACROSS SHADOWED WOODS
 
              We FOLLOW the flashlight beam as it surveys the windswept
              area.  JASON IS ILLUMINATED!  He raises up the sinister dart.
 
              TIGHT ON OFFICER
 
              Recognizing a weapon in this prowler's hand, he goes for his
              revolver.
 
              CLOSE ON JASON'S ARM
 
              With supernatural strength, he throws the deadly projectile
              at us.
 
              ANGLE ON OFFICER
 
              Before he can pull his gun, THE DEVIL IMPALES ITSELF DEEP
              INTO HIS FOREHEAD.  The force of it sends him reeling back.
 
              THE TARP-COVERED BOAT
 
              Officer Thornton's body falls into it.  His lifeless eyes
              stare up at the sky.  The dart extends from his third eye.

                        Let me know when you're about to
                        blast into hyperspace.  I'll
                        fasten my seat belt.

              drives like a man possessed.

                        I got a bad feeling we're already
                        too late.
 
              Megan glances back at the large sack in the rear seat.  She
              reaches over and looks in at his supplies doubtfully.

                                  MEGAN
                        Are you sure this is gonna work?
                        I mean, why didn't we bring that
                        gun and just blast him away?

                        It probably wouldn't have any
                        effect on him.  The only sure way
                        to stop Jason is to return him to
                        his original resting place, where
                        he drowned in 1957.

              The infamous lake is churning in the moonlight.  RACK FOCUS
              as Officer Pappas steps before us.  It's apparent that he's
              getting tired of searching for God-knows-what.
 
              TRACK WITH OFFICER
 
              His flashlight scans the windblown, vibrating bushes.
              Suddenly, FOOTSTEPS are HEARD on the other side of the bushes.
 
              ANGLE ON OFFICER
 
              He stops abruptly and strains to listen.  Tentatively, he
              creeps toward the bushes.

              We HEAD toward whatever is hiding behind the trembling
              shrubbery.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE - ON OFFICER PAPPAS
 
              Reaching the brushes, he calls out:

                        Alright, come out of there!

              ANGLE ON BUSHES
 
              No reply.
 
              BACK ON OFFICER
 
              He draws his revolver and aims it.  He knows someone's there.
 
                                  OFFICER PAPPAS
                        I'm askin' you one more time
                        ...come out of there!
 
              Still no response.
 
              MOVING SHOT - FOLLOWING OFFICER
 
              With his gun held before him, the nervous officer goes for a
              closer look.
 
              TIGHT ON HIS FACE
 
              Tension builds as he comes closer.
 
              RESUME ON MOVING SHOT - FOLLOWING HIM
 
              He is almost to the bushes.  WITHOUT WARNING, SOMEONE DIVES
              BEFORE US AND ATTACKS HIS LEG.  He gasps aloud.
 
              ANGLE ON OFFICER AND NANCY
 
              The frightened child holds on to Pappas for dear life.  He
              catches his breath, then crouches down next to her.
 
                                  OFFICER PAPPAS
                               (kindly)
                        Hey, hey, what are you doing
                        running around out here?  Now you
                        get back to bed.
 
              She squeezes his leg even tighter.

                               (terrified)
                        No.  There's a scary man.
 
              The good-looking officer smiles with amusement.
 
                                  OFFICER PAPPAS
                        What scary man?
 
              JASON EXPLODES OUT OF THE BUSHES.
 
              NANCY RUNS SHRIEKING TOWARD THE CAMP.

              OFFICER PAPPAS OPENS FIRE ON JASON.

              ANGLE ON OFFICER
 
              Suddenly Jason is before him.  His powerful hand reaches out
              and grabs the officer's SCREAMING face.
 
              TIGHT ON OFFICER'S FACE
 
              JASON'S FINGERS DIG IN TO THE COP'S SKIN.  HE YANKS DOWN,
              LITERALLY RIPPING THE SKIN OFF HIS SKULL.
 
              A BLOODY GRINNING SKULL STARES AT US FOR A MOMENT, THEN DROPS
              FROM VIEW.

              Leaving the door open, he sprints across the camp towards the

              As he rounds the corner of a cabin, Nancy comes SCREECHING
              toward him.  He catches the child and attempts to comfort her.

              Quickly, the sheriff picks Nancy up and heads for the cabin.

              INT. BOY'S DORMITORY CABIN
 
              Sheriff Garris bursts into the cabin.  All the girls have
              gathered in the boys' cabin for safety.  He puts little Nancy
              down and addresses the petrified youngsters.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Kids, listen to me very carefully.
                        I want everyone to lie down on the
                        floor and stay there.  Do not get
                        up until I come back.  Now hurry.

              He pumps the weapon as he walks.

              With stern vigilance, he storms toward his objective.

              arrives in the area behind the cabins near the lake.  There
              is no one to be found.  The savage wind whips the trees and
              bushes, causing the sheriff to twitch at every movement.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE
 
              Slowly, he turns and heads into the shadowed area between the
              cabins.
 
              MOVING SHOT - ON SHERIFF
 
              With the shotgun held before him, he walks tensely through
              this dark passage.
 
              TIGHT ON HIS FACE
 
              The sheriff's eyes dart nervously, straining to see in the
              near blackness.  Suddenly, he trips and falls from view.

              Rapidly, we TILT DOWN as he slams down on Officer Pappas'

              THE SHERIFF'S FACE LANDS PRESSED AGAINST THE GROTESQUE BLOODY
              SKULL.  Horribly repulsed, he scrambles to his feet.
 
              THE SHERIFF
 
              stands up, turns, and JASON IS WAITING RIGHT THERE.
 
              WIDER
 
              Quickly, he backs away from this masked spectre of evil.
              Then they both stands motionless for a long time, sizing each
              other up.
 
              LOW ANGLE - ON JASON
 
              He decides to make the first move.  He lunges forward.

              Instantly, he raises the shotgun and BLASTS Jason with both
              barrels!

              DOLLY TOWARD THE SHERIFF
 
              Shocked beyond belief, the sheriff drops the rifle and pulls
              out his .357.  Backing up, he empties the chamber into the
              stalking ghoul.
 
              ANGLE BEHIND JASON
 
              As he advances on the firing sheriff, we see THE BULLETS
              EXITING FROM JASON'S BACK.
 
              TIGHT ON JASON CLOSING IN
 
              All this is only making him madder.
 
              TIGHT ON TERRIFIED SHERIFF
 
              His gun CLICKING empty, he has but one option left.  He takes
              it.  The sheriff turns and runs like hell toward the woods!
              JASON IS RIGHT BEHIND.

                                  MEGAN
                        It's okay.  It's me--Megan.  Don't
                        be afraid.
 
              NANCY AND A COUPLE OTHER KIDS
 
              run over and hug her for security.
 
                                  MEGAN
                               (trying to sound calm)
                        It's all right.  Shhh-hh.
 
              ANGLE ON DOORWAY
 
              Tommy looks in and is relieved to see they're all right.  He
              quickly turns and runs back down the steps.
 
              EXT. LAKE FOREST GREEN - BOAT LANDING - NIGHT
 
              Tommy races from the campsite toward the dock, lugging the
              heavy satchel.
 
              ANGLE ON TOMMY
 
              Reaching the landing, he starts to board one of the two boats.
 
              TIGHT ON TOMMY
 
              He recoils in horror.
 
              TOMMY'S P.O.V.
 
              The murdered cop, Officer Thornton, lies in the rowboat.  His
              dead eyes glare right at us.  Blood flows from the impaled
              dart in his forehead.
 
              BACK TO TOMMY
 
              He immediately goes for another boat.

              ANGLE ON ROWBOAT
 
              Unfortunately, this one is older and more rickety, evident
              when Tommy steps into it and it SQUEAKS and MOANS.
 
              TIGHT ON SACK
 
              Opening it up, Tommy pulls out a long and very heavy chain.
              He then withdraws some huge padlocks.
 
              ANGLE ON TOMMY
 
              With intense urgency, he looks along the lake shore for
              something.

              Suddenly, they stop, turn, and retrace their steps.
 
              ANGLE THROUGH TREES - ON JASON
 
              Seems he has lost his prey.  Carefully, he searches the
              RUSTLING bushes for the hiding sheriff.
 
              TIGHT ON SHERIFF'S SWEATING FACE
 
              Buried deep in the thick bushes, the winded sheriff holds his
              breath as Jason passes.
 
                                                       CUT TO:

              Megan has done her best to assure the children that they are
              safe.  She stands up.
 
                                  MEGAN
                        Now I gotta find my daddy, the
                        sheriff, so we can all go home.
                        Okay?
 
              The kids nod.
 
              MEGAN
 
              heads for the door.  She turns to them.

                                  MEGAN
                        So you stay here and we'll be back
                        to get you.  Everyone lie back
                        down and don't worry.
 
              ANGLE ON TWO BOYS
 
              The 12-year-old youngsters seen earlier.  Billy turns to his
              sarcastic friend Tyen.

                               (scared)

                                  TYEN
                        I think we're dead meat.

              Tommy struggles to roll a large, heavy rock toward the boat.
              In the background, Megan is running around the campsite
              CALLING OUT for her father.
 
              ANGLE ON TOMMY
 
              Already fearing the worst, he yells to Megan:
 
                                  TOMMY
                        Megan!  Use your dad's car radio
                        and call for assistance...and an
                        ambulance!
 
              EXT. CAMP FOREST GREEN - NIGHT
 
              ANGLE ON MEGAN
 
              She stares at Tommy, petrified at what that means.  She then
              runs toward the sheriff's car.
 
              ANGLE ON CAR DOOR
 
              As Megan throws the car door open, SISSY'S HEAD ROLLS OUT AND
              LANDS AT HER FEET.
 
              LOW ANGLE - UP AT MEGAN
 
              She goes berserk with horror.

                               (screaming)
                        Oh, God!  Oh my God!

              Megan looks around, terrified that this same fate has
              befallen her father.  She SCREAMS OUT even LOUDER:
 
                                  MEGAN
                        Dad!  Answer me!  Daddy, where are
                        you!  Help us!

              CLOSE ON SHERIFF
 
              He looks up, HEARING his daughter's distant CRY.  What can he
              do?
 
              ANGLE ON JASON
 
              He stops his search.  He HEARS Megan as well.  JASON HEADS IN
              THE DIRECTION OF MEGAN'S VOICE.
 
              WIDER
 
              The sheriff peeks out of his hiding place.  Our killer storms
              by without seeing him.  Jason is hell-bent for Megan.
 
              CLOSER ON SHERIFF
 
              Seeing Jason heading towards his daughter, his protective
              fatherly instincts cause him to take action without thought.
              He leaps out at Jason!
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        No!  Not her!
 
              JASON IS TACKLED FROM BEHIND
 
              With almost superhuman strength, the sheriff attacks Jason
              and starts pounding him into the ground.

              TIGHT ON JASON AND SHERIFF
 
              So aggressive and relentless is the pummeling, for a moment
              you think he might kill the monster.  But only for a moment...
 
              CLOSE ON JASON
 
              Only disoriented and not at all hurt, Jason rolls over under
              the sheriff.  He grasps the sheriff's arm, stopping the
              assault.
 
              ANGLE DOWN - ON THEM
 
              JASON SHOCKINGLY TEARS THE SHERIFF'S ARMS OUT OF THEIR
              SOCKETS.  He throws them aside.
 
              LOW ANGLE UP - ON THEM
 
              JASON GRIPS THE SHRIEKING LAWMAN'S HEAD.  HE PUSHES IT BACK,
              CAUSING THE SHERIFF'S BODY TO BEND ALL THE WAY BACKWARDS.
 
              TIGHT ON SHERIFF'S CONTORTED FACE
 
              As he is forced back toward his feet, a horrid CRACK is
              HEARD.  HIS SPINE HAS BEEN SNAPPED IN HALF.  His body
              collapses backwards.
 
              WIDER
 
              Enraged, Jason throws the rag doll-like body of the sheriff
              aside as he rises.  Megan's VOICE is HEARD again, calling for
              the father.  JASON HEADS FOR HER.

              ANGLE ON BOAT
 
              The chains are arranged to go around the rock.  Tommy tries
              to brace himself as they lower the boulder down.  A CRACK is
              HEARD as the huge stone lands in the old wooden boat.

              She grabs the locks and gives them to him angrily.

                        You're gonna be sorry.
 
              TOMMY
 
              starts padlocking the chains tightly around the rock.
 
                                  TOMMY
                        I hope not.

              paces the dock in nervous fear.  She doesn't know what to do.

                        Megan!  Get back into the cabin
                        with the kids.

              Suddenly it dawns on her that he's actually leaving her alone
              out here.  She panics.

              Megan is only a few yards from the cabin.  WITHOUT WARNING,

              He springs up and grabs the stunned Megan.
 
              TIGHT ON MEGAN'S FACE
 
              As she SCREAMS, Jason's hand grips her face.  She is about to
              share the same horrific fate as Officer Pappas.

              He suddenly tosses Megan aside and heads for Tommy.
 
              MEGAN
 
              falls on the ground, trembling and hyperventilating.  She

              Jason reaches the lake and keeps going as if the water didn't
              even exist.  He stays fixed on the one thing he's wanted to
              kill the most...Tommy.

              EXT. ON LAKE - IN BOAT - NIGHT
 
              Seeing he's got him, Tommy sits down.  He reaches for the
              chain noose and holds it in his sweating hands.
 
              EXT. LAKE SHORE - NIGHT
 
              Jason is wading deeper into the dark, choppy waters.

                        Tommy, get out of there!  Row to

              JASON
 
              turns back towards the boy.  He moves on him like a hungry
              shark.
 
              ANGLE ON CHAIN NOOSE
 
              Tommy's nervous hands keep the noose out of Jason's sight as
              he opens it wider.
 
              TIGHT ON JASON'S MASKED FACE
 
              He is almost to the boat.
 
              TIGHT ON TOMMY'S FACE
 
              He is sweating profusely as he grits his teeth.
 
              TIGHT ON NOOSE
 
              It's ready.

              JUST AS JASON REACHES THE BOAT, HE SUBMERGES, DISAPPEARING
              INTO THE DARK WATERS.
 
              ANGLE DOWN - ON TOMMY IN BOAT
 
              The boy goes crazy, looking from one side to the other.
 
              CLOSER ON TOMMY
 
              He scans the sinister, churning waters.  Where will Jason re-
              emerge?
 
              BACK ON ANGLE ABOVE TOMMY AND BOAT
 
              A long, tense wait.
 
              ANGLE OFF SIDE OF BOAT
 
              Bubbles rise.  Tommy holds the noose over him.  JASON
              EXPLODES UP FROM THE OTHER SIDE.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE ON BOAT
 
              Tommy loses his balance and drops the noose into the bottom
              of the boat.  His fall causes the rickety boat to CRACK.
 
              INSERT - ON HULL
 
              Water starts to leak in around the huge rock.
 
              JASON
 
              grabs for Tommy, who struggles to reach the noose.
 
              EXT. CAMP FOREST GREEN - NIGHT
 
              Megan is freaking out, not knowing what to do.
 
              EXT. LAKE - NIGHT
 
              JASON'S HAND GRABS TOMMY'S JACKET.  The boy fights to break
              free of his grip.
 
              INSERT - ON HULL
 
              Their struggle causes it to split open wide.  More water
              pours in.
 
              ANGLE ON TOMMY'S FOOT
 
              He tries to snag the noose as Jason pulls harder on him.

              TOMMY
 
              yanks his arm away violently, causing his sleeve to rip off
              in Jason's hand.
 
              ANGLE ON TOMMY'S FOOT
 
              He manages to catch to noose with his shoe.
 
              INSERT - ON HULL
 
              The boat is filling up with water around the rock.
 
              JASON
 
              grabs ahold of Tommy's leg.
 
              TOMMY'S OTHER FOOT
 
              slides the chain up to his outstretched fingers.
 
              ANGLE ON TOMMY AND JASON
 
              The boy grabs the noose and forces it over Jason's head.
 
              TIGHT ON JASON
 
              Enraged, he lunges at Tommy!
 
              ANGLE ON BOAT
 
              That's all that's needed to split open the hull!  JASON IS
              PULLED UNDER AND HE DRAGS TOMMY DOWN WITH HIM.
 
              EXT. CAMP FOREST GREEN - NIGHT
 
              MEGAN SCREAMS HYSTERICALLY.
 
              INT. UNDERWATER
 
              The large boulder falls to the bottom of the lake.  Its chain
              pulls taut.
 
              CLOSE ON JASON
 
              The chain noose tightens around Jason's neck.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE
 
              Jason struggles to hold on to Tommy while trying to loosen
              the choke-chain.

              TIGHT ON TOMMY
 
              He fights to free himself of Jason's grasp before running out
              of breath.
 
              ANGLE ON JASON
 
              He gives up on the noose, opting to strange Tommy instead.
              Both are drowning in this battle.
 
              EXT. LAKE - NIGHT
 
              Bubbles appear on the surface of the lake.  After a flurry of
              them, they cease.
 
              EXT. CAMP FOREST GREEN - NIGHT
 
              MEGAN COVERS HER MOUTH IN DREAD.
 
              EXT. LAKE - NIGHT
 
              After a moment, Tommy's limp body rises to the surface.  It
              floats, lifeless.
 
              INT. UNDERWATER
 
              Jason's body also hangs lifeless, anchored vertically by the
              chain...The two have destroyed each other.
 
              EXT. CAMP FOREST GREEN - NIGHT
 
              Knowing it's over, all the kids slowly exit the cabin.  They
              surround the catatonic Megan.  The wind has DIED DOWN.
 
              LITTLE NANCY
 
              stares up sorrowfully at Megan.
 
                                  NANCY
                               (softly)
                        Is he kill-ded?
 
              MEGAN
 
              breaks out of her shock.  She heads for the lake.
 
                                  MEGAN
                               (to kids)
                        Stay here.
 
              REVERSE ANGLE TOWARD LAKE
 
              Megan races to the lake and dives in.

              EXT. LAKE - NIGHT
 
              Megan swims toward the motionless Tommy.
 
              ANGLE DOWN - ON MEGAN AND TOMMY
 
              She reaches her man, holds him around the chest, and pulls
              him to shore.
 
              INT. UNDERWATER
 
              MEGAN'S LEG IS GRABBED BY JASON.  He tries to pull her down.
 
              EXT. LAKE - NIGHT
 
              Megan fights for her life as she repeatedly gets yanked down.
 
              INT. UNDERWATER
 
              Megan's feet kick at her attacker.  But Jason's iron grip
              will not let go of her leg.
 
              TIGHT ON JASON'S HEAD AND NECK
 
              ONE OF MEGAN'S POWERFUL KICKS DRIVES INTO JASON'S THROAT.  A
              stream of final air bubbles and disgusting, ugly black fluid
              rushes from his mask!
 
              JASON'S HAND
 
              lets go of Megan's leg.  She swims away.
 
              FINAL SHOT OF JASON
 
              Our infamous killer is at last defeated.  His rotting corpse
              hangs in its original underwater burial ground.
 
              EXT. LAKE SHORE - NIGHT
 
              Megan pulls Tommy's body onto the shore.
 
              THE CHILDREN
 
              run down and surround them with concerned faces.
 
              ANGLE ON MEGAN AND TOMMY
 
              She frantically gives him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
 
              TIGHT ON TOMMY
 
              He doesn't respond.

              MEGAN
 
              won't accept that he's dead.  She fights back the tears as
              she pushes on his abdomen.
 
              TIGHT ON TOMMY
 
              Still nothing.
 
              ANGLE ON NANCY
 
              She watches Megan trying desperately to revive the lifeless
              boy.  The child gets an idea.  She closes her eyes and
              whispers a little prayer.
 
              RESUME MEGAN AND TOMMY
 
              The tears are now flowing down Megan's cheeks.  She knows her
              efforts are in vain.  In frustration, she strikes his chest
              hard.
 
              TIGHT ON TOMMY
 
              He coughs and spits out water.
 
              ANGLE ON MEGAN
 
              She WHOOPS and helps him to sit up.  A few of the kids CHEER.
 
              LITTLE NANCY
 
              opens her eyes and is quite surprised it worked.  She looks
              heavenward and smiles a "thank you."
 
              CLOSE ON TOMMY
 
              As Megan hugs him gratefully, Tommy looks out over the
              moonlit lake.
 
                                  TOMMY
                               (sighs; relieved)
                        It's over, Megan.  It's finally
                        over.  Jason is home.
 
              WIDE ON SCENE - BEHIND GROUP
 
              We look over the shoulders of Tommy, Megan and the kids as
              they stare at the now-peaceful lake.
 
                                                       FADE OUT:
 
              FADE IN:

              EXT. CEMETERY - DAY
 
              SUBJECTIVE MOVING CAMERA
 
              Slowly we HEAD between the tombstones, stalking the old
              caretaker, Martin.  He is bent over, pulling weeds.  We COME
              CLOSER and CLOSER, then finally stand towering over him.  He
              senses us and turns around, STARTLED.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE ON MARTIN
 
              He climbs nervously to his feet, quickly dropping the weeds.
 
                                  MARTIN
                               (overly friendly)
                        You.. .ha-ha.. frightened me.  I
                        was just, you know, cleaning up
                        the...place, you know.  Ha-ha.
 
              OVER THE SHOULDER OF STRANGER - ON MARTIN
 
              All we see is a dark suit and longish red-gray hair.  The way
              Martin looks up at him, we know he is hiding true terror of
              this mysterious stranger.
 
                                  MARTIN
                        Er.. nice to see you again, Mr.
                        Voorhees...Haven't seen you in
                        Crystal...er, Forest Green, in
                        quite some time.
 
              There is only a deathly silence from the nefarious man.
 
                                  MARTIN
                               (nervously)
                        Hey, I've been takin' real good
                        care of your wife and son's
                        graves.  Go look. You'll be real
                        pleased.
 
              Martin forces a grin to cover his fear.
 
              ANGLE ON MR. VOORHEES' HAND
 
              It reaches into his back pants pocket and withdraws a small
              wad of money.  The gnarled hand gives it to Martin.
 
              MARTIN obsequiously accepts his payment.  He practically
              genuflects before him.
 
                                  MARTIN
                        Thank you, Mr. Voorhees. Thank
                        you.  I'll leave you in private,
                        like you like.  Okay, er...bye. 
                        Thank you.
 
              He takes his earning and dashes away...probably to the liquor
              store.
 
              ANGLE ON LAWN
 
              Mr. Voorhees' black shoes head toward us and stop.  Slowly,
              we TILT UP toward his face.  Just as we reach his chest...
 
              ANGLE OVER HIS SHOULDER - ON TWO GRAVES
 
              We recognize them from before.
 
              CLOSER ON GRAVES
 
              Of course, they are his wife's and son Jason's.
 
              WIDER ANGLE - FROM BEHIND HIM
 
              He stands menacingly over his family's resting place...Does
              he sense something is wrong here?
 
              EXTREME CLOSEUP OF HIS EYES
 
              They stare down at his son's grave.   These eyes are truly
              evil.  Cold.  Dark.  Demonic.  Then the worst happens... They
              slowly look up at us.  They seem to accuse us of knowing the
              true whereabouts of his son.  AND HE WON'T STOP GLARING AT US.
 
                                                       DISSOLVE TO:
 
              EXT. LAKE FOREST GREEN - DAY
 
              We GLIDE tranquilly over the blue water toward the middle of
              the lake.
 
                                                       DISSOLVE TO:
 
              SLOWLY MOVING IN on the water, it seems we are about to
              descend into it... JASON EMERGES AT US!  We PULL BACK a bit.
              No, it's only his infamous MASK.  Freed from it's wicked
              owner, it floats peacefully along old CRYSTAL LAKE... for now.
