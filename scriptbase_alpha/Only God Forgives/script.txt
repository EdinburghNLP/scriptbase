          With the support of the Media Programme of the European Union
          The SOUND of Muay Thai boxing... The Art of Eight Limbs... Thrust
          and move... Feet shuffling across the ring...

                         FADE IN:

          INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT

          CLOSE ON a pair of hands from VARIOUS ANGLES...
          The SOUNDS of the fighting grow LOUDER. Punches, kicks, elbows...
          The hands tense into fists. They're strong hands. Fighter's hands.

          ZOOM OUT TO REVEAL Julian (mid-thirties) staring at his hands.

          Even though he's kept in shape, he hasn't fought for a long time.
          The SOUND of the boxing match gets LOUDER STILL as Julian continues
          staring at his hands - it's almost as if he's meditating. Suddenly
          he breaths in.

          Behind him sits a young kid dressed in Thai boxing clothes - this
          is Liang, barely sixteen. He looks nervous, occasionally glancing
          at Julian's reflection through the huge mirror that hangs on the
          far wall.

          Julian continues to stare at his hands and closes them into a
          tight fist.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. CORRIDORS - NIGHT

          The SOUNDS of the boxing match reach FEVER PITCH as we TRACK WITH
          Julian and Liang making their way towards the ring.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. THAI BOXING RING - NIGHT

          Two Young Thai Boxers beat the crap out of each other.
          The crowd is wild with excitement, people placing bets on which
          way the fight will turn.

          One of the Thai Boxers goes down and money immediately starts
          changing hands...

          The ring is cleared and Liang jumps in as Julian pushes his way
          though the crowd, nodding at people as he passes. They know him
          here.

          Again bets are placed....

          PICK OUT a face in the crowd. Billy. Julian's older brother (late
          thirties).

          Julian sits down next to Billy who's delighted to see him, throwing
          his arm around him, pulling him in close.

                          BILLY
           ... I love violence!

          Billy offers Julian a hit from his bottle of Mehkong whiskey.
          Julian refuses. He's more interested in the fight.

          BACK TO THE RING where the fight has just started. Liang is
          immediately on the ropes.

          Julian watches, concerned.

          Billy takes a phone call but he can't hear. He nods to Julian
          and takes it outside.

          BACK TO THE FIGHT where Liang pulls an amazing move. Turns the
          tables. Takes the bigger man down with a series of jabs, swings
          and backfists.

          As Julian applauds Liang's success, Billy slinks off out of the
          auditorium.

          Liang wins the fight with a knock out... The crowd go wild with
          adulation...

          Julian watches, transfixed...

          Liang is lit up by a beatific white light... As he stands triumphant
          in the middle of the ring, the crowd start to gather round him...
          Julian continues to stare at what's taking place before him...

          ... Which is almost like a religious ceremony... The audience
          bow down before Liang as he stares out into the light... A look
          of calm washing over his face... A sense of stillness and peace...
          Enlightenment through victory and violence...

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. BANGKOK STREETS - NIGHT

          Billy stalks the streets of the city of vice. A man on a mission.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. CHANGING ROOMS - NIGHT

          Liang is sitting on a bench, his constantly-smiling Mother beside
          him, as Julian peels off fifty Bhat notes.
          We get the sense that Julian's proud of him, that Liang is something
          of a protege of his and that Liang is incredibly pleased to have
          gained his approval.

                          JULIAN
           Two fifty, three hundred...

          Liang takes the money. Julian pulls off two more notes. A bonus.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           You did well out there. You've got
           something, Liang. Potential, yeah?

          Liang nods.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           Don't spend it all in once place.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. BACK ALLEY - NIGHT

          Billy comes down a back ally and knocks on a door. After a moment
          the door opens.

          The Doorman recognises him and lets him enter.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. UNDERGROUND NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

          WE TRACK with Billy as he makes his way through the small
          subterranean nightclub.
          A Thai man - known as The Lizard - sits by a table with a few
          locals gambling...
          He spots Billy and follows him with his eyes as he continues to
          gamble.
          Billy moves across to a small private corner...
          ... where he meets various men and women, all smoking
          Methamphetamine. Billy joins in but an argument quickly starts
          up between him and another Thai Man.
          The music's too loud to hear what they're arguing about but it
          suddenly gets out of control... Billy starts viciously hitting
          the Thai Man and quickly the room EXPLODES in a frenzy of violence.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT

          A fan does what it can to cool Julian down as he counts out money
          at his desk. Sitting opposite him, feet on the table, is Gordon,
          Julian's lieutenant and the closest thing to a friend he's got...
          Julian's phone rings. He interrupts his counting. Picks up and
          listens...

                          JULIAN

           (ON THE PHONE)
           Hold on, hold on. What did he say?
          Beat as Julian listens. He glances over at Gordon who looks up,
          concerned.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)

           (ON THE PHONE)
           No, tell him to stay there. Tell them
           both to stay there.
          Beat.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)

           (ON THE PHONE)
           I'm coming over.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. BACK ALLEY - NIGHT

          The Lizard sits outside the nightclub, somehow managing to smoke
          a cigarette at the same time as he stems the flow of blood from
          his nose with a handkerchief.
          Julian and Gordon arrive.

                          JULIAN
           He still in there?

                          THE LIZARD
           ... No.
          Beat... Julian glances at Gordon.

                          JULIAN
           You told him I was coming...

                          THE LIZARD
           Wouldn't listen...
          Julian stares at him...

                          JULIAN
           Well maybe you didn't try hard enough.
          The Lizard takes the handkerchief away from his nose. Shows the
          bloodstain to Julian.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           When was the last time you slept?
          The Lizard smiles but stares at Julian with hatred in his eyes.

                          THE LIZARD
           Just cause I ain't slept for three days,
           don't mean I don't know right from
           wrong... and your brother has become
           a real problem...
          Again Julian stares at him - clenching his fist. The Lizard notices
          this but gazes up into Julian's face blankly.

           THE LIZARD (CONT'D)
           You're not going to cause another
           ruckus in my club now - are you?
          A long pause as Julian considers it.

                          JULIAN
           No.

                          THE LIZARD
           Good - 'cause Billy ripped me off and
           then he broke my face...
          Julian turns to Gordon.

                          GORDON
           Like I always said. One day he's going
           to meet the devil.
          Beat.

                          JULIAN
           You know where he is now?
          The Lizard stares at Julian.

                          THE LIZARD
           Bangkok has millions of people my
           friend. You and your brother, you're
           lost to my world...
          The Lizard gets up - puts out his cigarette and looks at Julian...

           THE LIZARD (CONT'D)
           So what you going to do? You wanna come
           in? Very good amphetamine in here...
          Julian looks over to Gordon. Sees he's keen.

                          JULIAN
           You go. I'm gonna look around. See if
           I can find him.

                          GORDON
           Sure--?

                          JULIAN
           Go on.
          He turns back to The Lizard.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           Which way'd he go?
          The Lizard nods his head towards the busy street. Julian turns
          and heads off... Gordon steps up to the entrance to the club.
          The Lizard sticks out an arm, blocking his way.

                          THE LIZARD
           His brother didn't pay.

                          GORDON
           So? That's his problem.

                          THE LIZARD
           Now it's your problem.

                          GORDON
           I'm with you mate. Billy's fucked--

                          THE LIZARD
           You don't pay his debt - you don't enter.
          Gordon thinks for beat. Takes out his money...

                          GORDON
           How much...?
          ...and The Lizard smiles for the first time.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. MA LONG'S BROTHEL - NIGHT

          Julian is talking to Ma Long, fifties, the mother figure to a
          group of girls who stand in the background.

                          JULIAN
           You seen Billy?

                          MA LONG
           Not this evening.
          A particularly pretty prostitute catches Juilan's eye. He stares
          at her, stone faced.

                          JULIAN
           Well if he comes in, tell him I'm looking
           for him, yeah?

                          MA LONG
           He's not coming in. I tell him to stay
           away. He hurt one of my girls Julian.
           Not good...
          Julian considers. Pulls out his wad of notes again. Hands a few
          to Ma Long.

                          JULIAN
           Yeah, well... if you see him, tell him
           I'm looking for him...
          Ma Long nods as she takes the money.
          Julian is about to leave. He looks at the pretty prostitute again.
          Stares at her for a moment. Then walks out.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. BANGKOK STREETS - NIGHT

          Billy's so wasted he's bumping into people. He starts window
          shopping the various brothels that line the street: groups of
          girls smiling at him... Anything for a price...
          PICK OUT one particularly young-looking girl. Just fifteen.
          She makes eye contact with Billy... He smiles... Pulls out a roll
          of notes...

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. BANGKOK STREETS - NIGHT

          Julian out in the middle of the road. Girls on the pavement, girls
          in the windows. A steady line of punters cruising past.
          He stands alone. Focussed. Watchful. An island in a sea of neon.
          It feels ominous. Like something really bad's about to happen...

                          CUT TO:

                         

           ONLY GOD FORGIVES

                         FADE IN:

          INT. TAXI - NIGHT

          CLOSE ON Chang, mid-forties, a man who looks like he's carved
          out of stone. The neon lights bleed over his face in a seemingly
          unending flow as he's driven towards his destination.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. SEEDY HOTEL - NIGHT

          Police cars are parked up outside. Chang gets out of his taxi.
          Pays the driver. Makes his way inside.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. SEEDY HOTEL - NIGHT

          Chang makes his way up the stairs to a landing where a GROUP OF
          POLICEMEN are gathered. Their circle opens up as Chang approaches
          and they bow as he joins them - like he's a God. One of the group,
          Kim Han Ho, gestures towards the door of Room 610 where TWO COPS
          stand guard. Chang gives a nod and the door is opened.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. ROOM 610 - NIGHT

          Chang stands silhouetted in the doorway. Stepping into the room
          he moves into the light in CLOSE UP. His face is a mask.
          The bed is drenched in blood. The fifteen year old prostitute
          lies naked on her back. She's dead, her body having been savagely
          beaten in some sort of brutal sex game gone wrong.
          Billy is slumped in the corner in his underpants, his eyes glazed,
          staring at MTV, a bottle of Mehkong whiskey in his hand, a crack
          pipe on the floor.
          Chang stares at him, giving nothing away.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. ROOM 611 - NIGHT

          The Hotel Owner serves tea to Chang who sits in silence with
          Lieutenant Kim. The door is open and we can see into room 610
          across the corridor where Billy is still sat staring at the
          television.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

          A young cop, Daeng, who has been watching Chang, summons up courage
          to whisper to his superior officer, Phaiban.

                          DAENG

                          (IN THAI)
           Who is that guy?
          Phaiban says nothing.

                          DAENG (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           Is he a cop?

                          PHAIBAN

                          (IN THAI)
           He was...
          Before Daeng can ask another questions, two more cops lead an
          older Thai man, Choi Yan Lee (50's, overweight, dragged straight
          from his bed) down the corridor towards the crime scene.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. ROOM 611 - NIGHT

          As Choi Yan Lee is delivered to the doorway, Chang gets up and
          goes over to him.
          A moment of uncertainty in Choi Yan Lee's face. Fear. He doesn't
          know why he's been brought here. He looks for some comfort from
          Chang. Chang gives him nothing.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. ROOM 610 - NIGHT

          Chang leads Choi Yan Lee to the doorway. Slowly Choi Yan Lee realises
          what he's looking at. His daughter. Dead. Mutilated.
          Every father's worst nightmare.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           Is this your daughter?
          Beat.

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           Yes.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           How could you?
          ... but Choi Yan Lee just stares at his daughter. Finally:

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           ... What?

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           How could you let this happen?

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           I didn't do anything.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           Well now's your chance.
          A long moment between them as Choi Yan Lee fails to understand
          what Chang is suggesting. Chang stands back.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           Do what thou will.
          Choi Yan Lee nods. Chang leaves the room, closing the door behind
          him.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. ROOM 611 - NIGHT

          Chang sits drinking tea in silence with Lieutenant Kim. The guards
          in the corridor stare at the closed door of Room 610 from where
          we hear the cries of Billy being beaten to death.
          ANGLE ON: Daeng who's starting to look scared. Phaiban puts a
          reassuring hand on his shoulder.
          As the beating reaches its climax, with Choi Yan Lee screaming
          out Thai obscenities, we hear the sickening sound of Billy's neck
          snapping. And then a regular thud as blow after blow rain down
          on his body.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. ROOM 610 - NIGHT

          Chang opens the door and looks through.
          Choi Yan Lee is sitting breathlessly on the floor covered in blood.
          In his hand he holds a piece of wood he has ripped from a chair.
          Billy lies dead, his head completely smashed in.

          EXT. BANGKOK - NIGHT

          A police car drives through the city streets and onto the freeway
          heading out of town.

          INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT

          The bloodied Choi Yan Lee sits in the back, Chang on one side,
          Kim on the other. As the police car turns onto a more major road,
          Choi Yan Lee starts to get nervous.

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           You missed my turning. I live that way.
          Beat. Chang says nothing. Phaiban is driving, Daeng in the
          passenger seat. Daeng looks back at them through the rearview
          mirror...

                          KIM

                          (IN THAI)
           We'll get you there.

          EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT

          The bright white headlights of the stationary police car blind
          Choi Yan Lee who's caught in their glare, rigid with fear.

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           I'm so sorry. Please. Please. Please
           don't hurt me. I'm so sorry.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           What are you sorry for?

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           I thought... You were there. He killed
           my daughter. I thought you were letting
           me...

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           Answer the question. What are you sorry
           for?
          Beat. Choi Yan Lee is wrongfooted. Tentatively...

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           I killed the Westerner?

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           And why did you do that?

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           He killed my daughter.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           And why did he do that?
          Choi Yan Lee can't answer.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           How old was she?

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           Fifteen...

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           You knew what she was doing and you did
           nothing.

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           How else can we make money? Four
           daughters. No sons. What else could I
           do?
          Daeng watches as Kim opens the boot and pulls something out. He
          walks towards Chang and hands it to him. Daeng sees that it's
          an axe.

           CHOI YAN LEE (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           What did you expect me to do? You have
           to have pity on me. My daughter's just
           been murdered.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           This isn't about her. This is about your
           other three daughters and making sure
           you don't forget them.
          Chang nods to Kim and Phaiban who grab hold of Choi Yan Lee. Kim
          slips a plastic strap around Choi Yan Lee's arm, using it as a
          tourniquet. They wrestle him to the ground and pull his arm out.

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           I won't forget. I promise. Forgive me.
          Chang approaches with the axe. He stops for a moment. Looks down
          at him...

           CHOI YAN LEE (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           I'll change. I'll be a better man.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           I know.
          Chang slams down the axe, severing Choi Yan Lee's arm at the elbow.
          Choi Yan Lee SCREAMS in agony.

          INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

          The anonymity of a hotel room. Julian opens the curtains and we
          see the sky line of Bangkok - he looks out.
          He lies back on the bed, surfing through two hundred TV channels.
          Settles on a boxing match. Starts drifting off...
          As he drifts we hear the SOUND OF SINGING. A karaoke rendition
          of 'I Hung My Head' by Johnny Cash.

                          VOICE
           I set off running
           to wake from the dream
           My brother's rifle
           went into the sheen
           I kept on running
           Into the south lands
           That's where they found me
           My head in my hands

          INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT

          REVEAL that the voice is that of Chang and he's not half bad either:
          deeper than you'd have though, and with it comes a stage presence,
          a sort of John Wayne swagger...

                          CHANG
           The sheriff he asked me
           Why I had run
           And then it came to me
           Just what I had done
           And all for no reason
           Just one piece of lead
           I hung my head
           I hung my head.
          The policemen, still dressed in their uniforms, watch in
          respectful silence. Daeng sits with them. He too watches in awe.

          Chang opens the door as quietly as he can. He slips off his shoes

          INT. CHANG'S APARTMENT / KITCHEN - MORNING

          On the kitchen table Chang sees a picture. A badly-drawn house
          with a man, a woman and a child. Across the bottom: "LOVE YOU

          DADDY FROM DAUGHTER AND WIFE XXX'
          Chang stares at it and smiles - picks it up and pins it to the
          fridge with a magnet.

          Chang and Kanita, his eight year old daughter, are playing with
          her dolls who have captured a soft toy.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           So now that they've caught him... What
           are they going to do?
          Kanita thinks for a moment.

                          KANITA

                          (IN THAI)
           Put him in jail.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           Come on. They haven't got a jail big
           enough. Look at the size of him.
          Again Kanita thinks.

                          KANITA

                          (IN THAI)
           Keep him as a pet?

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           But he blew down all their houses. Would
           you want to keep a pet that could do
           that?
          Kanita shakes her head.

                          KANITA

                          (IN THAI)
           What if they just let him go?

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           How could they be sure he wouldn't do
           it again?

                          KANITA

                          (IN THAI)
           They could ask him...? Very nicely?
          Chang picks up the soft toy. Peels off a sticker from a sheet
          and places it between its eyes. Satisfied with his work he puts
          the soft toy back in the middle of the game.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           "And so the king and the fairies that
           lived in the village said to the
           creature: this is your mark which will
           stay with you forever. If you ever try
           and blow down our village again, it will
           heat up until it boils your brains, for
           it has magical properties. Go in peace.
          Kanita nods, happy with the judgement. She picks the soft toy
          up and 'walks' it away from the village of the dolls.

          Chang walks into his bedroom where his wife Nadee is just waking
          up. He kisses her good morning.
          As he starts to undress, she starts to get dressed. They share
          a smile about this. Finally Chang lies down on the bed and closes
          his eyes. Nadee kisses him good night.

          As Chang sleeps the heavy curtains are drawn to keep out the light
          of the day - but they cannot deaden the sound of the city outside
          as it goes about its frenetic everyday business.
          The CAMERA MOVES through the apartment, briefly settling on the
          sleeping Chang, then roaming through the various rooms, PICKING
          OUT different objects...
          We see that Chang is obsessed with cowboy films and a keen collector
          - the sitting room is stuffed with movie posters, photographs
          and other bits of movie memorabilia...
          Amongst the many family photos we also PICK OUT several pictures
          of Chang when he was in the army and shots of what looks like
          a very successful career as a Thai boxer.
          At the end of the tour we're back with Chang. We ZOOM IN to a
          tight CLOSE SHOT.

          and opens to reveal...
          ...Two Thai girls - one being Mai - standing in the hallway. Julian
          lets them enter.
          Mai embraces Julian, kissing him on the mouth as Julian closes
          the door.
          They turn to consider the other girl who is starting to undress.
          She smiles compliantly, eager to please.
          Julian turns back to Mai and kisses her again. As the kiss becomes
          more passionate, the other girl joins them and the three of them
          begin to have sex.

          Chang walks down the streets towards a school. Standing at the

          Chang looks round and gazes out the window into the street where
          pedestrians stream past. Suddenly Chang has a strange VISION:
          All the women disappear. In the street there are only men.
          We cut to a CLOSE UP of Chang and then back to his VISION again:
          Now all the men have gone and he can see only women.
          Back to the CLOSE UP of Chang who continues staring out of the

                         WINDOW:
          ... where everything is back to normal. Men and women walking
          up and down the sidewalk.

          drug paraphernalia, etc.
          Julian lies sleeping, entwined in the limbs of the girl...
          There is a knock on the door. Julian and the girl ignore it.
          A pause and then Julian's mobile phone starts ringing. He doesn't
          answer.
          The knocking starts up again, this time louder. Finally:

                          JULIAN
           Julian's not here mate. Fuck off...
          Beat - then we hear a voice from behind the door.

           GORDON (O.S.)
           Julian?
          Still they ignore him. Either too wasted or too tired to do anything
          else.

           GORDON (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           Julian...? I need to talk with you...
          Beat. Finally Julian answers with zero energy...

                          JULIAN
           What is it?

           GORDON (O.S.)
           It's about Billy...

                          JULIAN
           I can't deal with my brother right
           now...
          Beat.

           GORDON (O.S.)
           He's dead...
          Julian opens his eyes, confused - still out of his head on drugs.

                          JULIAN
           What?
          No answer. Finally Julian gets up and wraps a towel around his
          body and slowly opens the door.
          Gordon stands in the hallway - behind him two Thai men from Julian's
          crew.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           What happened?

                          GORDON
           They found his body in a hotel room...
          Julian doesn't know what to say... Neither does Gordon.

                          GORDON (CONT'D)
           Look, get dressed and I'll see you
           downstairs.
          Julian nods and closes the door. He stands still - glances out
          the window - seeing the sun setting and the night coming in. He
          glances at the pretty girl still sleeping on the bed.
          He goes into the bathroom where Mai is dressed and putting on
          make up.

                          MAI
           What happened?
          Julian looks at her.

                          JULIAN
           Someone killed Billy...

          any emotion.
          He turns to Gordon who's standing behind him.

           What do we do?

                          JULIAN

          He looks out across the city again then back to the phone.
          It's like he's scared.
          He picks it up quickly and dials. A moment as it rings then it's
          answered.

                          JULIAN
           Hello Mum.
          Beat.

          forties and could actually pass for late thirties. She strides
          towards reception, a Porter struggling to keep up with her. This
          is Jenna Hopkins. Head of a notorious London Crime Family. Mother
          of both Julian and Billy. Newly appointed Lady Macbeth of Bangkok.
          She hands her passport over to the Concierge.

                          JENNA
           I'd like to check in now please.
          The Concierge checks the computer.

                          CONCIERGE
           I'm afraid the room won't be ready until
           four o'clock.
          Beat... Jenna just stares at him...

                          CONCIERGE (CONT'D)
           ... It's policy

                          JENNA
           I'd like to speak to your manager.
          Beat.

                          CONCIERGE
           Yes of course...
          The Concierge retreats. Jenna lights a cigarette.

                          MANAGER
           Good afternoon madam, what seems to be
           the problem?

                          JENNA
           Listen to me... I've just travelled six
           thousand miles to see the corpse of my
           first born son and I haven't slept for
           thirty hours and he says I can't go to
           my room.
          The Manager just stares at her but is clearly taken back by her
          force...

                          MANAGER
           I'm sorry madam...

                          JENNA
           How much?

                          MANAGER
           ... it simply isn't possible.
          Jenna pulls out a massive bundle of notes. Peels off a couple
          of hundred dollar bills.

                          JENNA
           ...Fuck off you cunt, just hand me the
           fucking key...
          She lays the money on the desk. The manager looks around...

                          MANAGER
           Well I might be able to arrange
           something...
          The Manager turns to the Concierge.

                          JENNA
           Don't leave the money there. Some
           cunt'll nick it. Put it in your pocket.
          The Manager hesitates.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           Put it in your pocket.

                          MANAGER
           There's really no need--

                          JENNA
           Put it in your fucking pocket.
          The Manager takes the money. Pockets it. Places the key on the
          desk.

                          MANAGER
           Room 300.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. FOUR SEASON'S HOTEL / CORRIDOR - DAY

          The lift doors open and Jenna walks out, the Porter struggling
          to keep up with her as she swishes down the corridor.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. FOUR SEASON'S HOTEL / ROOM 300 - DAY

          The struggling Porter opens the door and lets Jenna in. She walks
          into the suite and gives it the once over.
          Satisfactory.
          The Porter places her bags on the side and hangs up some of her
          clothes, desperate to try and get out in one piece... As soon
          as he's finished he bows and starts to shuffle out of the room.

                          JENNA
           Hey... Open this.
          Jenna points to the Duty Free bag then starts running a bath,
          beginning to undress.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           I need a drink.
          The Porter is stunned.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           Well don't just stand there...
          The Porter fumbles, taking the gin out of the Duty Free bag, spilling
          the tonic in his nervousness as he makes her cocktail.
          Jenna returns in a dressing gown, takes the drink off him and
          takes a huge slug.
          The Porter is terrified, stunned. Rooted to the spot.
          Jenna sits on the bed and stares out of the window. Just as the
          Porter thinks it's safe to try edging out of the room again, she
          starts talking to him...

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           I loved him so much you know... Billy...
          Beat. The Porter doesn't know what the fuck she's talking about.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           Everyone loves their children don't
           they? Well, not everyone, but...
          She looks over at him. The Porter smiles at her.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           Do you want to see a picture?
          The Porter nods, uncertain. Jenna gets up, goes over to her purse.
          Opens it up. A picture of Billy.
          She hands it to the Porter - who takes it and just looks at it,
          not knowing what to do...
          Jenna starts to cry. For a long time. Finally...

                          PORTER
           Madam. I have to return to my station.
          Jenna snaps out of it in an instant.

                          JENNA
           What, yeah, thanks.
          She pulls a fifty dollar bill out of her purse. She hands the
          money to the Porter who leaves as quickly as he dares.

          INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHTMARE

          The elevator doors open. Julian steps out into the empty hallway.
          Everything is normal... But everything is also not normal.
          The CAMERA tracks from behind as Julian walks - looking at the
          doors as he passes them and finally stopping in front of one:
          He knocks but there is no answer. Realizing the door isn't locked,
          he pushes it open and steps in.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHTMARE

          The room is exactly the same as the one Jenna's staying in. However,
          instead of her, Julian sees a man sitting on the bed, his back
          to him. His features are obscured...
          Julian slowly begins to walk towards him, but before he can reach
          out, the figure turns to face him...
          It's Chang. But there is blood smeared all over his face...
          Julian stares at him in horror. Slowly he looks down at his hands
          only to discover that they're dripping in blood...
          We ZOOM IN on his hands.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

          Julian wakes from his nightmare - covered in sweat. He is alone.
          He sits up. Looks at his hands, still very shaken by his nightmare...
          We hear the traffic of Bangkok. Julian gets up and walks to the
          table... Light up and begins to smoke morphine... He walks to
          the window and looks out over Bangkok...
          His phone rings - Julian answers...

                          JULIAN

           (ON THE PHONE)
           Hello?

           JENNA (V.O.)
           It's me...

                          JULIAN

           (ON THE PHONE)
           Hi Mum. Where are you?

           JENNA (V.O.)
           I'm in Bangkok...

                          JULIAN

           (ON THE PHONE)
           What?
          Julian looks at his watch.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)

           (ON THE PHONE)
           ... I thought you didn't get in til
           midnight...?
          Beat.

           JENNA (V.O.)
           I needed to be by myself...

                          JULIAN

           (ON THE PHONE)
           Okay... so, what d'you want to do?

           JENNA (V.O.)
           Raise Hell...
          Julian turns his back to the window.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. FOUR SEASON'S HOTEL / BAR

          Jenna looks immaculate. She stubs out her cigarette when she spots
          Julian making his way towards her. She gets up and they embrace.
          She holds on to him. A little too long.
          Finally she pulls away. She looks at him for a long time.

                          JENNA
           Could it be have been one of the gangs?

                          JULIAN
           Maybe. Take your pick. Billy wasn't
           popular.

                          JENNA
           What do you mean?

                          JULIAN
           You know Billy... He was eccentric.
          Jenna smiles to herself as if this brings back memories and Julian
          even smiles. Both sit in silence for a moment.

                          JENNA
           But you're going to find out who did
           it, right?

                          JULIAN
           I'll make sure it gets done.

                          JENNA
           No, it needs to be you that does it.
           We need to show them. Do you understand
           what I'm saying?

                          JULIAN
           Yeah, okay, I'll do it.

                          JENNA
           Good.
          HOLD ON Julian as we bring up the SOUND of Johnny Cash's Ring
          of Fire.

                          VOICE
           Love is a burning thing
           And it makes a firey ring
           Bound by wild desire

           The taste of love is sweet
           When hearts like ours meet

           Oh, but the fire went wild.
          One of the crew, the rat faced Charlie Ling, starts talking to
          the Hotel Owner who was there the night of the murder. A couple

          A Tuck-tuck makes its way through the crowded streets driven by
          one of Choi Yan Lee's Three Daughter's.
          In the back sits Choi Yan Lee, his stump of an arm in a sling,
          a daughter either side of him.
          His arm's only just been bandaged up and he's clearly still in
          a lot of pain, his face going into spasm with every bump in the
          road.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. CHOI YAN LEE'S KIOSK - DAY

          Julian stands on the street corner sipping a soft drink. Waiting.
          Behind him Gordon, his phone glued to his face.
          On the other side of the road is Choi Yan Lee's Kiosk, big enough
          to double as his home, currently manned by his long suffering
          wife Kim Yan Lee. She serves a chilled coconut to a man. As he
          turns round we reveal... he's a particularly murderous looking
          member of Julian's crew - Ko Sam.
          We pick out Charlie Ling a little further down the road, who's
          looking at a tray of battery powered robots that some Street Kid's
          selling.
          They're all counting down the minutes. Biding their time. Waiting
          for Choi Yan Lee to turn up.
          Finally the sound of the Tuck-tuck approaching...
          Ko Sam drinks his coconut down in one - slurping as he hits the
          bottom. Letting the empty shell fall to the floor.
          Charlie Ling stands up. Feels the gun under his jacket.
          The Tuck-tuck pulls up and Choi Yan Lee's Daughters help him into
          the kiosk that doubles as their home.
          Julian and his men close in.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. CHOI YAN LEE'S SHACK

          As Choi Yan Lee enters his home and his daughters make a fuss
          of him, the shutters of the kiosk counter are suddenly SLAMMED

          SHUT.
          They all turn round in panic, but before they can do anything
          about it, the last of the three daughters is pushed into the kiosk,
          followed by Ko Sam, Charlie Ling, Gordon and Julian.
          Choi Yan Lee snivels in the corner, waving his bandaged arm in
          the air.

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           You can't kill me. I'm a cripple.

           KIM YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           Who are you? What do you think you're
           doing? Get out or we'll call the police.
          Ko Sam shakes his head at her. Not a good idea. Julian turns to
          Charlie Ling.

                          JULIAN
           Ask him if he's Choi Yan Lee.
          At the mention of his name the colour drains from Choi Yan Lee's
          face. His eyes lock with Julian's.

                          CHARLIE LING

                          (IN THAI)
           Is your name Choi Yan Lee?
          Choi Yan Lee nods his head.

                          JULIAN
           Ask him why he killed my brother.

                          CHARLIE LING

                          (IN THAI)
           You killed his brother. Big mistake fat
           man. Why'd you do it?
          Beat. Choi Yan Lee knows he's been caught...

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           He murdered my daughter.

                          CHARLIE LING
           He says he killed his daughter.
          Julian considers him for a moment. Slowly he pulls out a gun...
          Aims it at Choi Yan Lee's face...

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           Oh God. Please don't kill me. Please.
           I'll give you anything. Anything you
           want. My daughters. My shop. Please.
           I've paid for what I did. Look at me.
          In his desperation Choi Yan Lee suddenly lurches forward,
          brandishing his wounded arm at Julian. He pulls the bandages off,
          exposing the bloody stump.

           CHOI YAN LEE (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           I've paid for what I did. Don't you see?
          Julian turns to Charlie Ling.

                          JULIAN
           What's he saying?
          Beat.

                          CHARLIE LING
           He says... He says he's paid for what
           he's done. That he's been punished
           already.
          Choi Yan Lee nods his head enthusiastically.

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           He told me to do it. Then he took my
           hand. Look.
          Again he thrusts his stump at Julian who glances at him.

                          JULIAN
           Who did that to him?
          Choi Yan Lee looks at the various faces that surround him - then
          stares directly at Julian.

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           The Angel of Vengeance...
          Charlie Ling looks at him surprised... yet there's a sense that
          deep down he knows what he's talking about...

                          CHARLIE LING

                          (IN THAI)
           It's a lie - he doesn't exist...

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           I'm telling the truth. It was the Angel
           of Vengeance.

                          JULIAN
           What's he saying?

                          CHARLIE LING
           He's lying...

                          JULIAN
           Tell me.

                          CHARLIE LING
           It's a story old women tell their grand
           children... 'The Angel of Vengeance'
           is supposed to come down from the
           heavens and judge the living...
           restore karma to the world..
          Gordon laughs... but Julian listens with great interest...

                          JULIAN
           How does he do that?

                          CHARLIE LING
           Leads people to their destiny...
           That's the myth anyway.
          Ko Sam smiles. Julian doesn't. Finally:

                          JULIAN
           Ask him who cut his hand off.
          Charlie Ling's reluctant to question him further. Julian insists.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           Do it.

                          CHARLIE LING

                          (IN THAI)
           Who turned you into a cripple - and no
           bullshit this time.
          Choi Yan Lee continues babbling hysterically...

           CHOI YAN LEE

           (IN THAI, QUIETLY)
           I'm telling you the truth... The Angel
           of Vengeance is real... He made me do
           it... You've got to believe me... I've
           already been judged.

                          CHARLIE LING
           He says it was The Angel of Vengeance...
          Choi Yan Lee starts to giggle uncontrollably.

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           The Angel of Vengeance. Yes. You don't
           find the Angel of Vengeance. No. He
           finds you.

                          JULIAN
           What's he saying?

                          CHARLIE LING

                          (IN THAI)
           Pull yourself together fat man. If you
           don't talk sense I'll cut off your cock
           and shove it down your throat.

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           I'm telling you the truth. He'll find
           you.
          Choi Yan Lee retreats to the corner of the room.

                          JULIAN
           What did he say?
          Charlie Ling considers Choi Yan Lee. Realizes he's not going to
          get a better answer out of him...

                          CHARLIE LING
           He said you don't find The Angel of
           Vengeance. He finds you...
          Julian considers this for a long time. He realises he's not pointing
          his gun anymore. Puts it away.

                          GORDON
           Are we going to kill him or what?
          The room suddenly feels stuffy. The atmosphere oppressive.
          Julian's got to get out...

                          GORDON (CONT'D)
           What are you doing?
          But Julian's already stumbling out of the kiosk...

                          JULIAN
           Nothing... We're not going to do
           anything... Just leave him. Leave them
           all.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. KIOSK - DAY

          Julian stumbles out of the kiosk and breaths in lungfulls of air.
          Disoriented, he careers into a stall selling various religious
          artefacts, sending candles, incense and statues of Buddha
          flying...
          He falls to the ground. When he gets to his feet everything around
          him seems intense and incredibly vibrant... The dogs fighting
          on the street, the Buddha that lies in pieces on the ground, the
          children that stand watching him, his crew as they come out of
          the kiosk, hiding their guns...
          Julian takes a long moment to get his bearings... Finally he stands
          up, but as he does he feels different... As if the axis of his
          world has shifted...

          INT. THAI BOXING CLUB - NIGHT

          The CAMERA TRACKS from the side as we see Jenna walk through the
          boxing gym. All around her people are fighting and sparring.
          She spots Julian and Gordon through the large windows of the office.
          They see her and stand up.
          We LINGER OUTSIDE in the training area as Jenna goes through THE

          DOOR...

                          CUT TO:

          INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT

          Boxers train in the background. Jenna, Julian and Gordon sit in
          silence. Finally:

                          JENNA
           Did you kill him?
          Beat. A shared look between Gordon and Julian.

                          JULIAN
           It's a little bit more complicated than
           that Mum.

                          JENNA
           Complicated? He killed my son...
           What's so fucking complicated about
           that?

                          JULIAN
           Mum, calm down...

                          JENNA
           Don't tell me to calm down. I want him
           dead.
          Beat... Julian does not know how to explain the situation. Jenna
          stares at him.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           We don't forgive. Only God does.

                          JULIAN
           I know, you always say that - but this
           is different...

                          JENNA
           How?
          Silence. Julian doesn't know how to answer. Jenna watches him
          carefully...

                          JULIAN
           Maybe... Maybe Billy had it coming...

                          JENNA
           What are you talking about?

                          JULIAN
           ...because of what he did.
          Jenna thinks it over for a moment.

                          JENNA
           I don't care.

                          JULIAN
           Why?

                          JENNA
           Just don't - some Thai cunt murdered
           your brother and we're not going to let
           him get away with it.

                          JULIAN
           What if... What if it was The Angel of
           Vengeance?
          Jenna stares at her son like he's finally lost the plot.

                          JENNA
           The Angel of fucking what...?

                          JULIAN
           ...it - or he - restores karma and order
           in the world.

                          JENNA
           'Restores' things? Who said anything
           about 'restoring' things?
          Beat.

                          JULIAN
           He loves all humans...

                          JENNA
           I don't know what kind of spiritual
           journey you're on, but you will kill

                          HIM--

                          JULIAN
           I'm not, I'm just...
          Julian can't get the words out. He gets up.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           ... I've got to go.
          ...and Julian leaves - letting the door to the office stay open.
          We pick up the sounds of the fighters training outside as we slowly
          ZOOM IN on Jenna. She turns to Gordon.

                          JENNA
           How's business?

                          GORDON
           It's alright, yeah. Well, what with
           Billy not being around, it's tricky to
           be honest...

                          JENNA
           What d'you mean?

                          GORDON
           Well, we're supposed to be moving five
           keys out the end of this week. But
           Billy's not here, is he?

                          JENNA
           I'm here. Julian's here.
          Gordon shrugs. Jenna clocks it.

                         

                         

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           What's gotten into him...? Is he high
           or something?

                          GORDON
           I don't know. Earlier today - we had
           the guy... The guy that killed Billy.
           Had a gun against his face. But then
           - nothing...

                          JENNA
           Nothing?

                          GORDON
           Julian let him go. Now there's all this
           stuff about angels... I don't know what
           the fuck's wrong with him.

                          JENNA
           Not like you...
          Gordon smiles at her uncertainly.

                          GORDON
           I know how to do what needs to be done.
           That's all.
          She stares at him, long enough to make him uncomfortable.

                          JENNA
           So tell me... What did he mean when he
           said it was complicated?

                          GORDON
           There's this other guy... Might have
           been involved...

                          JENNA
           So we kill them both.

                          GORDON
           We don't know who the other guy is yet...

                          JENNA
           Okay. Well how about we start with the
           guy we do know?

          INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT

          A girl sings 'Another Woman's Man' by Dolly Parton.
          Julian's sitting alone at a table, nursing a drink.
          Mai enters, looking much more sophisticated than when we saw her
          in the hotel. She sits next to Julian and gives him a kiss on
          the cheek.

                          MAI
           Sorry I'm late.

                          JULIAN
           It's alright...
          He drinks his drink. Silence...

                          MAI
           What's wrong?

                          JULIAN
           Nothing.
          Mai looks around the bar... It's half empty - some girls and men
          spread out.
          The waitress comes over and Mai orders a drink. They sit in silence,
          listening to the song...

                          MAI
           See anyone you want us to take home
           tonight?
          Julian glances round but shakes his head. Looks at Mai.

                          MAI (CONT'D)
           What?

                          JULIAN
           Nothing...

                          MAI
           What's with you? You want to get high?
          Beat. Silence. Finally...

                          JULIAN
           I want you to meet my Mum.
          A pause, Mai slightly taken about.

                          MAI
           Is she here?
          Julian nods.

                          MAI (CONT'D)
           D'you want me to?
          Julian nods. Mai studies him.

                          MAI (CONT'D)
           Why d'you want me to meet her?

                          JULIAN
           To show her... To show that I've got
           something here...

                          MAI
           What, like we're a couple?
          Julian stares at her for a long time. Can't quite say it out loud,
          but the answer's yes.

          Choi Yan Lee oversees his daughter's serving hot food to customers.
          FOCUS ON Liang, the young kick boxer, watching him from across
          the street. Liang pulls out a knife which glints in the light
          of the street lamps. He heads over to the shack.
          Liang asks Choi Yan Lee a question. Choi Yan Lee leans over to
          hear him better. Liang GRABS hold of his hair and PULLS him over
          the counter, SLITTING his throat with the knife.
          Choi Yan Lee's wife and daughters look on as blood floods from
          his neck, over the sweets and snacks on sale and down to the ground
          below.
          Life slips away from Choi Yan Lee in a matter of seconds. Liang
          holds onto him until he's dead and then lets go of his head and
          runs off into the night.

          Gordon pulls out several hundred dollars.

                          GORDON
           Never come back - you understand me?
          Liang nods.

                          GORDON (CONT'D)
           Good...
          Liang takes the money. A proper pay out.

                          GORDON (CONT'D)
           You're a fighter, kid. No doubt about
           it. Good luck with that.

          INT. BACK ROOM - DAY

          Julian's talking to Liang's Mother and Sister who are sitting
          in front of him, both upset. Gordon hovers in the background...

                          JULIAN
           When did you last see him?

                          LIANG'S SISTER
           Last night. He went out.

                          JULIAN
           Did he have any enemies?

                          LIANG'S SISTER
           None.

                          LIANG'S MOTHER

                          (IN THAI)
           Someone called him.

                          LIANG'S SISTER
           Someone called his mobile.

                          JULIAN
           Who?

                          LIANG'S SISTER
           She doesn't know. They spoke in
           English.
          Liang's Mother pulls out a mobile phone. Passes it to Julian.

                          JULIAN
           This his phone?
          Liang's Sister nods. Julian scrolls through the numbers. All have
          Thai names against them - except one. Julian considers the number,
          then redials.
          A beat. Then the SOUND of a phone ringing in the same room.
          Gordon looks round. Realises he's busted. Takes his phone out.
          Kills it.
          Julian stares at him. Before he gets a chance to say anything,
          there is a knock on the door.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           What is it?

           THAI MAN (V.O.)
           There's some cops here to see you.

                          JUILAN
           What do they want?

           THAI MAN (V.O.)
           Probably just money. You want me to find
           out how much?
          Julian thinks it over...

                          JULIAN
           No, I'll talk to them.

          INT. BOXING CLUB - DAY

          Julian clocks the cops who are waiting for him. He walks over,
          strangely on edge. As he gets closer he sees Chang - standing
          on the other side of the room by the boxing ring, his back to
          him, watching the sparring fighters... Julian stares at him...
          Turns back to the cops...

                          JULIAN
           Good morning officers. How can I help
           you?
          Slowly Chang turns to face him. Julian stares at him as if he's
          in a trance...

                          KIM
           We're investigating the murder of Choi
           Yan Lee.
          Julian recovers. Turns to Kim and shrugs.

                          JULIAN
           Never heard of him.

                          KIM
           His arm was cut off. Here.
          Julian manages to cover his reaction.

                          JULIAN
           I run a boxing club. Not much call for
           one armed men.
          A beat. Mexican stand off.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           What's this got to do with me?

                          KIM
           He was the father of the girl that was
           found dead with your brother.

                          JULIAN
           Then I guess you boys have got a lot
           of work to do - so have I, so if you'll
           excuse me...

                          KIM
           That's why we're here Mr Hopkins. If
           you could just answer our questions.

                          JULIAN
           Sure, sorry. What do you want to know?
          Julian looks over to Chang who continues staring at the boxers.
          The way the ring is lit he's almost silhouetted.

                          KIM
           Where were you last night?

                          JULIAN
           With my mum...
          Some of the boxers come over to Chang. They know him. They're
          reverential. With the effect of the lighting, it seems to Julian
          like they're bowing down before a God.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           You want to speak to her?

                          KIM
           That wont be necessary at the moment.

                          JULIAN
           Am I suspect?
          Chang turns round to face Julian. His presence is magnetic. Julian
          stares back at him, realizing that this must be the Angel of
          Vengeance... Chang walks over to them. Studies Julian for a long
          moment and then turns to Kim.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           This is not the man.
          And as soon as he's said it, he turns on his heel and leaves.
          The cops back off and away.
          ZOOM IN on Julian. Deflated and strangely disappointed... He turns
          to Gordon who's standing behind him.

                          JULIAN
           I want you to find out who that guy is.
           Okay?

                          GORDON
           Sure. No problem.

                          JULIAN
           Now.
          The SOUND of Nadee singing 'LONELY COMING DOWN' by Dolly Parton.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. KARAOKE BAR

          Chang sits on his own drinking apple juice as he watches his wife
          sing on stage. Julian enters, sees Chang but can only see the
          back of his face. He walks over to the bar, orders a drink.
          Julian starts to watch Nadee. When he turns back to the bar he
          sees Chang reflected in the optics - somehow standing right next
          to him, staring at him. Julian turns to face him.

                          CHANG
           Why are you here?

                          JULIAN
           You're him... Aren't you?

                          CHANG
           Who?

                          JULIAN
           The one who killed my brother.
          Chang says nothing for a long time.

                          CHANG
           I love all living things.
          Beat.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)
           I restore karma. Is that why you came?

                          JULIAN
           I came here to kill you.

                          CHANG
           What's stopping you?

                          JULIAN
           I don't know...

                          CHANG
           Would you like me to tell you?
          Julian nods.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)
           You want the Angel of Vengeance.

                          JULIAN
           Yes.

                          CHANG
           Why?

                          JULIAN
           Cause, all my life... I don't know.

                          CHANG
           Yes you do.

                          JULIAN
           My mother wants me to kill you.
          Chang stares back at him.

                          CHANG
           And what do you want?

                          JULIAN
           ... I love violence.

                          CHANG
           You want to fight me?
          Julian nods.

                          JULIAN
           Thai style.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          Three cops sit eating noodles.

                          KIM

                          (IN THAI)
           What about his brain?

                          PHAIBUN

                          (IN THAI)
           It's a risk... One hit in the wrong place
           and he'll be straight back in hospital.
           And maybe he wont be so lucky as last
           time.

                          DAENG

                          (IN THAI)
           Then why's he going to fight the
           Westerner?
          The question hangs in the air. It's what they're all wondering.

                          PHAIBUN
           He used to be a great boxer.

                          KIM
           He has to do it. Since he came out of
           the coma, that's what he's done.
           Whatever's been asked of him, he's done
           it. He can't help it. It's all a
           mystery...
          A mutual pause.

                          DAENG
           And if he loses?

                          PHAIBUN
           He can't lose. He's the Angel of
           Vengeance.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. CHANG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Nadee is standing behind Chang. They're playing a game in which
          they speak in English.
          She points out the window.

                          CHANG
           View.

                          NADEE
           Window.
          `She points at the table.

                          CHANG
           Table.

                          NADEE
           Do you like the table?

                          CHANG
           Yes. I like the table.
          Chang stiffens. Nadee detects the change in him.

                          NADEE
           What is it?
          Chang takes her in his arms. He starts kissing her neck.

                          CHANG
           I need to speak to you in Thai.
          A pause.

                          NADEE

                          (IN THAI)
           What is it?

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           I love you.
          She stares at him for a long moment. It's odd for him to have
          confessed his feelings in such a way. Not bad, just odd. And then
          she starts to kiss him back...

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. STREET - EVENING

          Julian is anxiously waiting outside. He looks up as Mai comes
          out of her appartment in a red dress.
          Julian's face drops.

                          MAI
           What is it?

                          JULIAN
           You can't wear that.

                          MAI
           Why not?

                          JULIAN
           My mother's... Very particular about
           colours.

                          MAI
           You're kidding?

                          JULIAN
           She hates red. Come on, we'll get you
           something else.
          Mai stares at him, reluctant to give in.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           Come on.

                          MAI
           This is insane.

                          JULIAN
           Look, I'm telling you. It's easier this
           way. Trust me.
          Mai gives in. Takes his hand.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. CLOTHES SHOP - NIGHT

          Chang picks out a dress for Mai. She takes it, finding it hard
          to believe that he's making her do this...

                          CUT TO:

          INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          Three people sit around a table awkwardly. Julian, Jenna and Mai
          (dressed very conservatively) all eating soup. A long silence.

                          JENNA
           So... May, isn't it?

                          JULIAN
           It's Mai, Mum.

                          JENNA
           How long have you two known each other
           then?
          Mai's about to answer but Juilan gets there first.

                          JULIAN
           A year and a half isn't it?
          Beat as Mai quickly counts in her head...

                          MAI
           ...that sounds about right.

                          JENNA
           Well it's always a rare treat to meet
           one of Julian's lady friends.

                          JULIAN
           Mum, please...

                          JENNA
           So, where did you two meet?

                          JULIAN
           I saw her walking down the street.
          Jenna raises an eyebrow...

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           And I thought - this is the most
           beautiful girl I've ever seen - so I
           just walked up to her and started
           talking.

                          JENNA
           I hear that happens a lot in this part
           of the world... Tell me, what's your
           line of work, Mai?

                          MAI
           I work in the service industry.

                          JENNA
           I bet you do. But tell me Mai, before
           you started serving my son, how many
           cocks were you serving? Was it over a
           thousand?
          Mai stares at Jenna in disbelief.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           I know girls like you. Just because you
           might be pulling the wool over my son's
           eyes don't think it's going to work with
           me.

                          JULIAN
           Mum, stop it, for fuck's sake.

                          JENNA
           I'm sorry Julian, but I won't stand by
           and let a dirty little hooker take
           advantage of my son in the vain hope
           that her womb isn't so diseased that
           she can trick him into impregnating her
           and putting another cocksucking child
           on to this earth.

                          JULIAN
           Leave her alone Mum. You've got her
           wrong. She's a good girl.

                          JENNA
           What do you know about what's good?
          Beat. Julian says nothing.

                          MAI
           He's good to me...

                          JENNA
           Well that's nice isn't it, I'm really
           happy for you--

                          JULIAN
           Mum!
          A pause.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           The cops came by my club today.
          Beat. She stares at him.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           They're investigating a murder. The
           guy that killed Billy turned up dead
           this morning.
          Jenna looks bored. Lights a cigarette.

                          JENNA
           Oh really, shame that, still, live by
           the sword, die by the sword...

                          JULIAN
           I know it was you, Mum.

                          JENNA
           I did what had to be done.

                          JULIAN
           He was there. He was with them.

                          JENNA
           Who?

                          JULIAN
           The Angel of Vengeance.

                          JENNA
           D'you kill him?

                          JULIAN
           No.

                          JENNA
           Cause he as good as killed Billy. What
           I want to know is, what are you going
           to do about it?

                          JULIAN
           I'm not going to kill him...

                          JENNA
           Yes you are. You're going to do it for
           me and you're going to do it for your
           brother.

                          JULIAN
           This isn't about Billy. This is about
           me. All my life I've been running...

                          JENNA
           That's right you cunt, cause you always
           run away whenever there's a problem...
           just like you're running away from
           killing this fucking Angel of whatever

                          -

                          JULIAN
           - his name is Chang-

                          JENNA
           Chang?!
          Mai stands up.

                          MAI
           I should be going now.

                          JENNA
           Sit down you cunt.

                          JULIAN
           Mum, don't talk to her like that.
          Mai sits down.

                          JENNA
           So what am I left with?
          Julian stares at her.

                          JULIAN
           Me.
          Jenna calms down. She looks at their reflections in the mirror
          behind the bar. We ZOOM in on the mirror, their faces refracted
          by the glass.

                          JENNA
           You're right. We're family. We stick
           together. But Billy was family too.

                          JULIAN
           Billy was a fuck up... He deserved
           everything he got. You know it and I
           know it.

                          JENNA
           That's it. I'm not listening to this.
           I don't ever want to hear you mention
           his name again... Do you hear me?

                          JULIAN
           Yeah we were brothers, but we were never
           close... And he was only in Bangkok
           cause you couldn't control him. So you
           sent him to me--

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           -- So you sent him to me and what could
           I do?

                          JENNA
           You could have protected him.

                          JULIAN
           I did what I could. And that's more than
           you ever did.

                          JENNA
           I would've done anything for him. Okay,
           he wasn't born with as many advantages
           as you were. He struggled with things.
           But I always stood by him.

                          JULIAN
           And what did that get him? I'll tell
           you what, a one way ticket to this
           fucking place, just like me.

                          JENNA
           Don't you dare blame me for what
           happened back then.

                          JULIAN
           I'm only here 'cause of you. If you
           didn't exist, I wouldn't be here.
          Beat.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           I could've been someone, Mum. I was on
           my way...
          Jenna stares at him - this is a conversation she does not like
          having...

                          JENNA
           You would've been a great fighter...
           You could've gone pro.

                          JULIAN
           Don't you think I know that? And look
           at me now. I'm a front for a drugs
           smuggling.
          He turns to Mai.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           It's true... The whole thing's a front.
           Every day I see kids coming in with great
           potential. And every day I see kilos
           of heroin going out. And it's all
           because of you, Ma. You and the money
           and the drugs.
          Jenna silently seethes, waiting for Julian to shut the fuck up.
          He quietens down...

                          JENNA
           At least you're not behind bars and
           that's more important to me.
          Julian turns to her - he has been waiting all his life to say
          this.

                          JULIAN
           That's right Mum. That's what's more
           important to you. But what about me?
           Sometimes I think you only got me out
           of there so the cops couldn't trace it
           back to you...
          Jenna stares at him. Her face a mask.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           ...that's right Mum. Think about it.
           With me gone you were safe. And it turned
           out to be good for business as well.
           All very convenient.
          Silence between them. Jenna lights another cigarette - her hands
          now shaking.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           Is that what happened with Billy? Did
           Billy become a problem like I did?
           Wouldn't surprise me, he was a big
           fucking problem when he was here...
           Still, at least you didn't have him
           killed.
          Jenna slaps him hard on the face. Julian recovers. Looks up at
          her. Very intense.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           I'm not going to kill him for you, Mum.
           Doesn't matter what you say. And do you
           want to know why?

                          JENNA
           Surprise me.

                          JULIAN
           'Cause I'm going to fight him. In the
           ring. Me versus him.

                          JENNA
           Well that seems sensible... And what
           do you hope that's going to achieve?

                          JULIAN
           I don't expect you to understand. Cause
           you don't understand anything that
           isn't about you.

                          JENNA
           And when you lose, what's going to
           happen then?

                          JULIAN
           I don't know... But maybe this time I'll
           win. Like you say, only God forgives.
           Maybe this time he'll forgive me...
          Jenna turns to Mai.

                          JENNA
           Do you understand what he's talking
           about? 'Cause I haven't got a fucking
           a clue.

                          JULIAN
           You never did, Mum.
          A pause. Julian's touched a nerve. Jenna recovers.

                          JENNA
           I hope you find what you're looking for.
           'Cause if you don't, it's going to find
           you and I'm not always going to be there
           to look after you.
          Jenna composes herself. Suddenly brightens. A different person.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           Nice to meet you Mai. Hope to see you
           again soon.
          Jenna shakes her hand. Mai's too shocked to resist. And then,
          as if nothing had happened, Jenna leaves.
          Julian covers his face with his napkin.

                          MAI
           Are you alright?
          He's not. He's crying. But he doesn't want anyone to see.

                          JULIAN
           I'm fine.
          Beat.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           I'll be fine. In a minute.
          Julian wipes his face clean. Pulls himself together.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           Sorry about that.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. FOUR SEASON'S HOTEL - NIGHT

          Jenna gets out of her cab and walks toward reception, a look of
          steely determination in her eyes.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. FOUR SEASON'S HOTEL - NIGHT

          The Concierge and the Manager see Jenna coming towards them and
          brace themselves...
          However, to their relief, she diverts to the palm court area where
          Gordon is waiting for her.

                          GORDON
           Nice evening?

                          JENNA
           Lovely, yeah. Just catching up, you
           know.
          Jenna sits down. Lights a cigarette.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           You're a piece of work, aren't you?
          Gordon blushes. Jenna blows out her match.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           No fucking hanging about with you, is
           there?

                          GORDON
           Well, I don't know about that. Just been
           out here a while... Know how to get
           things done.

                          JENNA
           I bet you do.

                          GORDON
           But things are going to shit. Since
           Billy died, Julian's all over the
           place...

                          JENNA
           We'll have to something about that the,
           wont we? But, first things first, what
           about Chang?

                          GORDON
           Who?

                          JENNA
           My son's guardian angel.

                          GORDON
           He's just a retired cop...

                          JENNA
           Good, then he won't be to hard to kill,
           will he?

                          GORDON
           It's not that simple... Is there
           somewhere we can go that's a little more
           private?
          Beat. She raises her eyebrows.

                          JENNA
           What did you have in mind?
          Gordon blushes. Moves closer, conspiratorial...

                          GORDON
           You can't just going round killing cops
           here anymore. It's not that easy.

                          JENNA
           I didn't say it was easy. But then,
           you're a resourceful man, aren't you?

                          GORDON
           I looked into it. Chang's a hard man
           to get to. None of the Thais'll go near
           him...

                          JENNA
           Well then you're going to have to find
           someone who's not a fucking Thai then,
           aren't you?

                          GORDON
           There might be a way... But Julian can't
           find out...
          Jenna looks at Gordon - smiles and crosses her legs.

                          JENNA
           Don't you worry about that. There are
           certain things that a mother and son
           shouldn't - and don't - discuss...
          Gordon thinks he does but isn't a hundred per cent sure.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

          Julian sits on a chair, holding his hand over a flame. Mai finishes
          applying make up, comes out of the bathroom wearing her red dress.
          She watches him for a moment.

                          MAI
           What are you doing?

                          JULIAN
           Seeing when it hurts.
          Mai watches him. He doesn't flinch.

                          MAI
           I'm going to go.
          Julian takes his hand off the flame. Sees she's left the clothes
          he bought her behind.

                          JULIAN
           Didn't you like what I got you?

                          MAI
           It's fine, but you know... It's not my
           style.

                          JULIAN
           What do you mean?

                          MAI
           Maybe you should give it to your mother.

                          JULIAN
           Don't to be so hard on her. Her life
           hasn't been easy.

                          MAI
           Come on Julian. She's a fucking bitch.

                          JULIAN
           Don't say that, okay? You don't know
           what you're talking about. She'd do
           anything for me.

                          MAI
           The way she talks to you --

                          JULIAN
           Don't go there.

                          MAI
           What? 'Don't talk about my mother'?
           Come on Julian.
          Julian stands up, angry.

                          MAI (CONT'D)
           Why don't you fuck her instead of me?
          Julian grabs hold her neck. Throws her hard against the wall.

                          JULIAN
           You don't get to judge her. You think
           she's bad? You should've met my dad.
           But he's not around anymore, and do you
           know why? Cause she loved me too much.
          He lets go of her neck. Mai rubs her neck.

                          MAI
           You're fucked.
          He pulls money out of his pocket.

                          JULIAN
           How much do I owe you?
          He forces a roll of notes into her hand, forcing her to take it.

                          MAI
           Fuck you.
          She opens the door, sets fire to the money, and walks out of the
          room.
          As she walks down the hotel corridor, Julian slams his fists into
          the wall.

          INT. SKYLIGHT BAR - NIGHT

          A mixed clientele. High class. Asian and European. But there's
          an edge to the atmosphere. The music's that bit too loud, that
          bit too aggressive. And the people inside don't look like they're
          having a good time. It seems evil. Sleazy.
          Jenna introduces herself to Yuri Karkov, a well dressed and
          charismatic Russian in his forties who is surrounded by Thai girls
          and fellow Russians including his distinctive looking bodyguard,
          Dimitri.
          As the camera TRACKS CLOSER to them we start to hear what they're
          saying...

                          YURI KARKOV
           ... so why do you want to kill a
           policeman? Policemen are good. They
           mind their own business and keep the
           streets safe. Stop people stealing my
           cars...

                          JENNA
           You really want to know?

                          YURI KARKOV
           Yes. It may effect the price.

                          JENNA
           He killed my son.

                          YURI KARKOV
           Revenge. Pricey...

                          JENNA
           This is Bangkok. Nothing's that
           expensive.

                          YURI KARKOV
           You're right. Most things are cheap in
           Bangkok. Especially life... We'll take
           care of this business for you. But it
           won't be easy and it won't be cheap.

          EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          A crappy van pulls up outside. Out get three Cambodian men. Very
          poor, badly clothed. They look like farmers. Only they pull out
          semi automatic firearms and head for the restaurant.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          Chang has just finished a meal with the Cops including Kim, Daeng
          and Phaiban. Chang is just settling the bill when the Three Gunmen
          walk in. He looks up just as they OPEN FIRE.
          An insane storm of led rains down on the room, shattering all
          the mirrors on the back wall, taking out Two Waitresses and covering
          the room with broken glass.
          Chang hits the floor and starts to drag himself towards some cover.
          Chang's men are completely pinned down. Phaiban's been hit and
          his white shirt has turned dark red with blood.
          Chang keeps edging towards where his jacket's hanging on a chair.
          In it, his pistol.
          The Gunmen keep firing. As soon as a clip is finished, they pull
          it out and put a fresh one in and keep shooting.
          A stray bullet hits the waiter who knocks over the chair Chang's
          jacket's on. It falls to the ground. With it, his pistol. He grabs
          it and returns fire, letting off four rounds.
          He takes Gunman One. Head shot, right between the eyes. Gunman
          Two sees this and sprays at Chang -
          - but Chang manages to dive to cover. He rolls and fires again,
          shooting Gunman Two in the chest three times.
          Chang's out of ammo and needs to reload. Gunman Three's weapon
          jams. He drops his weapon and runs.
          Before he's finished reloading his pistol, Chang's after him.
          He sees Phaiban. Dead. Daeng trying to stem the flow of blood
          from his chest.
          Chang keeps running, determined not to lose his man.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          The driver of the crappy van smokes nervously in the driving seat
          as he waits. As soon as he sees Gunman Three, panic-stricken,
          running in fear, he puts the van in gear, revs the engine and
          starts to pull away.
          Gunman Three runs after him, crying out for him to slow down.
          The Driver slows. Gunman Three struggles to jump into the open
          doors.
          Chang bursts out of the restaurant. Stops dead. Aims and fires
          off two rounds.
          Blood spatters across the inside of the windscreen. The Driver
          falls forward, dead.
          The back door of the van slams shut. Gunman Three thinks he's
          made it. He's wrong. The van isn't going anywhere.
          Chang approaches the back door of the van, ready to fire.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           Do you want to die? Do you want me to
           kill you? For what you've done?
          A long pause. Finally:

           GUNMAN THREE (O.S.)

                          (IN THAI)
           No. Please. Don't kill me.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           Tell me why not. Tell me why I shouldn't
           shoot you as soon as you come out of
           that door.

           GUNMAN THREE (O.S.)

                          (IN THAI)
           I'm sorry?

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           Not good enough.

           GUNMAN THREE (O.S.)

                          (IN THAI)
           It's my first time. I've never done
           anything like this before.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           I know that. You're wearing sandals.
           Hitmen don't wear sandals.
          The door opens. Sandaled feet step out of the van. Gunman Three
          comes out with his hands up, falling to his knees. Chang continues
          to point his weapon at the unarmed man.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           Give me a reason.
          The Cops appear behind him in the doorway. Chang holds his ground.
          His finger twitches. It looks like he's going to pull the trigger.

                          GUNMAN THREE

                          (IN THAI)
           I'm begging you. Please--

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           You showed no mercy in there. Why should
           mercy be shown to you?

                          GUNMAN THREE

                          (IN THAI)
           I don't know...

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           Yes you do.
          A long beat.

                          GUNMAN THREE

                          (IN THAI)
           I don't know his name.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           But you know where he is.
          Gunman Three looks up... Nods.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. COVERED ELECTRICAL MARKET - NIGHT

          Flanked by the Cops, Chang frog marches Gunman Three through the
          crowds, passing various stalls that seem to sell anything you
          could ever want for your TV, computer or Hi-fi.
          Gunman Three is so scared that he keeps forgetting the route and
          fretting about which way to turn at every junction in the
          warren-like market.
          Finally they reach the entrance to a particular shop.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. ELECTRICAL SHOP - NIGHT

          Chang enters, followed by the others. Gunman Three is incredibly
          relieved to have found it. Li Po stands behind the counter - beside
          him sits Pan, a twelve year old boy who is severely handicapped.
          As soon as Li Po sees Chang and his crew arrive with Gunman Three
          next to them he knows the game's up. He can't run. His kid's sitting
          there...
          He approaches them with a heavy sigh.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           You know why we're here.

                          LI PO

                          (IN THAI)
           Yes...

                          GUNMAN THREE

                          (IN THAI)
           He set it up. He knows who ordered the
           hit. He'll tell you.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           Don't talk unless I ask you to.
           Understood?

                          GUNMAN THREE

                          (IN THAI)
           Yes. Completely understood.
          Chang turns to Li Po.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           Do you have anything to say for
           yourself?

                          LI PO

                          (IN THAI)
           I'm a salesman. Some of the things I
           sell aren't exactly legal... But I'll
           give you the man that hired the hit...
          Chang stares at him...

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           Good...
          Li Po summons the contact details on his distinctive looking mobile
          phone. Proffers it to Chang.

                          LI PO

                          (IN THAI)
           As for myself, I'm not scared of paying
           for what I've done. I just... just don't
           hurt my son.
          Chang looks down at Pan - who is just staring at them, not
          understanding the situation.
          Chang takes the phone from Li Po.

                          GUNMAN THREE

                          (IN THAI)
           You see? He knows. He's got the details.
           I told you he would.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           And I told you not to talk unless I asked
           you.
          Chang aims his gun at Gunman Three.

                          GUNMAN THREE

                          (IN THAI)
           Wait. You said if I took you to him you'd
           let me live.
          Chang shakes his head.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           I never said that.
          Chang fires. Gunman Three's brains spatter across the TV screens
          on the far side of the wall.
          Pan begins to cry and Li Po hugs him and tells him how much he
          loves him... thinking they're next...
          Chang studies the mobile phone.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           This him?
          Li Po nods - scared.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           Where do I find him?

                          LI PO

                          (IN THAI)
           Skylight bar at the Jupiter.. Every
           night.
          Chang studies Li Po making sure he speaks the truth... then nods.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           I'm taking your phone.
          Chang turns to leave.

                          LI PO

                          (IN THAI)
           What about me?
          Beat. Chang considers. Looks at Pan who's staring at Chang in
          fear. Looks back at Li Po.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           I forgive you...

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. THE JUPITER - NIGHT

          A people carrier pulls up outside the hotel. The doormen open
          the side door and step back when they see the heavily armed and
          bloodstained policemen get out, led by Chang.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. SKYLIGHT BAR - NIGHT

          PICK OUT Dimitri and the group of Russian Criminals. Yuri Karkov
          is in the centre of them, a girl on either arm.
          Chang leads the Cops into the bar. He fires two shots into the
          ceiling. That shuts everyone up and gets the Russian Criminals
          up and ready for a confrontation. Half the bar's emptied by the
          time Chang reaches Yuri Karkov.

                          YURI
           You better have a fucking good reason
           for doing this. Don't you know who
           you're fucking with.
          Chang looks at him.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           You live in my country. Can't speak my
           language... Too bad the one guy on my
           team that could speak English got
           murdered today.
          Yuri looks round for help. He can't understand a word.

                          YURI
           Can someone tell me what the fuck this
           guy's trying to say...
          Chang calls over to the barman.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           Can you turn the music off. It won't
           be long, I promise.
          The music's killed.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           That's better. Thank you very much...
          Chang pulls out Li Po's distinctive mobile phone.
          Dimitri, currently flanking Yuri, turns white.
          Chang calls a number. A beat. Then a phone starts ringing in
          Dimitri's jacket pocket (with a really cheesy ringtone). Dimitri
          winces. Chang shakes his head.
          Yuri pulls a gun. Kim shoots him dead. Chang moves his gun across
          to Dimitri. Holds his mobile phone up to his ear.
          Dimitri answers. Chang speaks through the phone.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN ENGLISH)
           You're under arrest...

                          CUT TO:

          INT. SKYLIGHT BAR - LATER

          WE TRACK IN on Dimitri as he stares at Chang, a rabbit in the
          headlights. Chang slowly sits down next to him. Talks to him in
          English.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)
           I need information.
          Phaiban spins a spotlight onto Dimitri.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)
           And you're going to help me.
          Suddenly the atmosphere in the emptied club shifts. It's as if
          Dimitri and Chang are locked into some kind of surreal
          performance...

                          CHANG (CONT'D)
           Whether you like it or not.
          Dimitri's body starts to shake in fear.

                          DIMITRI
           It was an English woman - she wanted
           you dead...
          A beat. Not what Chang expected...

                          CHANG
           Why?

                          DIMITRI
           Said you... murdered her son....

                          CHANG
           Who was she?

                          DIMITRI
           I don't know...

                          CHANG
           How did she know me?
          Dimitri shakes his head. He really doesn't know.

                          DIMITRI
           She asked for you by name...

                          CHANG
           And what's my name?

                          DIMITRI

                          CHANG--
          Chang starts to circle him. Dimitri's terrified. Doesn't know
          what the fuck he's on about. Suddenly he's grabbed from behind
          by Phaiban.
          Chang smashes a beer bottle and walks up behind Dimitri...

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           I see the way you look at my people.
           The way you abuse them with your eyes.
           For this, I take your sight.
          He pushes the broken bottle into Dimitri's eyes. Gauges them out.
          Dimitri screams hysterically - calling out for his mother in
          Russian...

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           You live in my country, but you fail
           to learn our language. You don't even
           try. For this I take your tongue...
          Phaibun grabs Dimitri's head from behind. Chang presses down on
          his stomach with his knee and opens his mouth - grabs hold of
          his tongue and with a blade slowly cuts it off.
          ...Dimitri's screams become more like the howls of a dying
          animal...
          Chang looks at him and his men release Dimitri who stumbles around
          the room like a chicken without a head...

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           You had opportunities. You could have
           chosen other paths... But you wouldn't
           listen... For this I give you
           silence...
          Chang grabs Dimitri and pushes the knife into his ear. First one
          side, then the other.
          SOUND OUT. We can't hear Dimitri's screaming. We can't hear
          anything at all.
          Beat.
          MUSIC STARTS. Painful and beautiful, but also tacky... The opening
          bars to one of Dolly Parton's classics. Karaoke style.

           NADEE (V.O.)
           If I should stay, I would only be in
           your way.
           So I'll go, but I know I'll think of
           you every step of the way.
          And Chang with his crew just stare at the tortured Russian as
          he screams until his lungs are ready to burst.

          Gordon is sitting on a chair in Jenna's hotel room, a whiskey

           NADEE (V.O.)
           Bittersweet memories that is all I'm
           taking with me.
           So, goodbye. Please don't cry,
          Jenna walks in from the bedroom wearing her dressing gown and
          walks over to him - a commanding presence. He makes to get up
          but she pushes him down and then leans down and kisses him hard
          on the mouth.

           CHANG (V.O.)
           We both know that I'm not what you, you
           need.

          INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT

          As Chang waits for the instrumental section to end, he starts
          to cry, letting the tears flow without embarrassment. Nadee puts
          her arm around him to comfort him.
          The rest of the crew start crying as well, Daeng in particular.

                          NADEE

           You, darling, I love you.
           Ooh, I'll always, I'll always love you.
          Julian lifts his fists up. The same fighting pose we saw him in
          at the very beginning. He's ready. Ready as he'll ever be.

          INT. THAI BOXING RING - NIGHT

          Two figures kneel on either side of the ring. Julian and Chang.
          Both wearing Mongkol. Totally still.
          The ceremonial music begins...
          Slowly Julian and Chang start to perform Ram Muay, the ancient,
          traditional dance which the rules of the game say must be carried
          out before a fight takes place.
          It is both strange and spiritual: Julian and Chang move their
          arms rhythmically, in time to the music, their hands describing
          shapes and outlining fighting positions.
          As the dance develops, so their positions become more combative;
          now crouching, now standing, hinting at the kicks and punches
          that they're about to perform... but all carried out with an almost
          beatific precision that is at odds with the violence that is about
          to follow...

           FADE OUT.
          The Music Ends. A moment of stillness, and then slowly we bring
          up the SOUND of the baying crowd. Chanting. Screaming. Wild
          excitement. Ready for the fight they've all been waiting for...

                         FADE IN:

          INT. THAI BOXING RING - NIGHT

          The crowd is packed. In one corner: Julian. Charlie Ling beside
          him along with Ko Sam. He looks focussed. Confident.
          In the other corner: Chang. Kim next to him along with a couple
          of his crew. He looks incredibly calm.
          The first bell sounds. Five second warning...
          Chang looks over into the crowd. Kanita with Nadee. Kanita offers
          him a 'thumbs up'. Chang smiles. Returns it.
          Julian looks over. Sees Mai take a seat. She holds his gaze.
          The second bell sounds. The first of five rounds. Julian and Chang
          walk up to the centre of the ring. The Referee stands between
          them. Brings them together. A quick look down to the Three Judges.
          Then a look between the two fighters.
          Julian eyes Chang. Steely determination in his eyes. Chang looks
          back at him without emotion.

                          REFEREE

                          (IN THAI)
           Fight.
          Julian and Chang circle each other. Julian moves in to attack
          first. He throws a straight left first to Chang's face and steps
          his left foot forward at the same time. Chang bends his right
          leg, dodging the attack. He then pounces on the upper part of
          Julian's arm with his right hand and catches his wrist with his
          left hand. He tries to turn Julian's front wrist up, but Julian's
          too strong. This is a surprise for Chang. He breaks and steps
          back.
          Julian moves in to attack again, raising both elbows to make an
          attack on Chang's head. Chang steps forward and pulls an uppercut,
          connecting hard with Julian's chin. Julian moves back, dazed.
          Takes a moment to get his bearings back. That hurt.
          Chang doesn't take the opportunity to attack. He hangs back.
          Waiting for Julian to come at him again. This pisses Julian off.
          He moves forward and throws an offensive kick with his right foot.
          Chang moves back to dodge the attack and swivels to try and strike
          with a counter attack. He moves too slow. The right footed attack
          was a feint. Julian slams his right foot down on the floor and
          uses it to swivel, unleashing a kick with his left which connects
          with Chang's jaw and sends him flying back.
          Julian uses his forward motion to propel him onwards. He bounds
          over to the disoriented Chang and hits him with a series of jabs
          and punches to his upper body and face.
          Chang's almost on the ropes. Julian comes in hard with kicks to
          the shins with his right foot. Chang bends his body to pass under
          Julian's right foot. Julian misses the target. Chang manages to
          place his right foot on Julian's left knee-joint which makes him
          fall down.
          Julian's in a vulnerable position, but Chang doesn't move to make
          the killer blow. He steps back to let him recover. Again this
          enrages Julian.
          He gets up and moves forward towards Chang. He comes in with a
          high right kick. Again Chang manages to dodge the attack and returns
          with a right foot to the back of Julian's left knee. Julian swivels,
          punches air, and gets a trio of punches in his gut. His guard's
          down. But again no killer punch.

                          JULIAN
           Come on.
          Chang retreats. Shrugs at Julian. You come on.
          Julian moves towards him, but before he gets a chance to take
          out his frustrations, the bell goes. End of round one.
          Julian stalks back to his corner. He turns to look at Chang, a
          look of intense anger and frustration.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. THAI BOXING RING - NIGHT

          Julian moves towards the middle where Chang is already waiting.
          Julian waits for Chang this time. Chang is reluctant to attack.
          A waiting game... Who will strike first... Chang wins. Julian
          moves to kick Chang in the ribs, keeping both his hands down as
          he moves in. Chang predicts this and prepares to throw his own
          kick as it comes in. Chang steps back, but again Julian swivels,
          using his right foot instead to pivot and unleashes a killer strike
          with his left foot. Chang goes flying backwards.
          PICK OUT the look of concern etched on the faces of Nadee and
          Kanita.
          Chang recovers but Julian moves in fast with a series of punches
          and elbows. Chang's on the ropes now and getting badly beaten.
          He clings on to Julian to limit the damage.

                          REFEREE

                          (IN THAI)
           Break.
          The two fighters step back from each other. Chang's face is damaged.
          Juilan's about to get stuck into him again when the bell sounds.
          End of the second round.
          Round three: Julian slamming punches into Chang. Nadee comforting
          Kanita. Telling her it'll be okay. Chang responding with kicks
          and elbows. Defensive blocks and counter attacks. Mai willing
          Julian on. Jenna watching with Gordon...
          End of round: Julian feeling more confident. Again his eyes scan
          the crowd. This time he sees what he's looking for: Jenna.
          Chang eyeballs Julian from the other corner. Sees him staring
          into the crowd. Looks over. Tries to see what he's looking at
          but can't make it out.
          POV from Chang as he sees Jenna make her way toward Julian. When
          she gets to him we see her saying something to Julian about the
          fight - urging him to hit harder...
          Jenna then walks back to Gordon...
          On Chang. Deep in thought. He gets up early. Walks around the
          ring. Looking into the crowd.
          Jenna sees him. Stares at him. Suddenly nervous.
          Everything slows down as Chang clocks her again. The colours of
          the room change from blue to yellow to red. He's seen her and
          she knows she's been seen. And he knows. And she knows that he
          knows...
          The bell goes off. Back to reality. Chang turns round. Too late.
          He gets a massive blow to his head. He goes down hard.
          The Referee starts counting.
          Nadee and Kanita watch on, fearful.
          Jenna holds her breath. Hopeful that he might be down and out.
          Kim watches on, concerned.

                          KIM

                          (IN THAI)
           Get up. Please get up.
          After a long, terrible pause... Chang gets up. He looks over into
          the crowd. Makes eye contact with his wife. It's okay.
          She shakes her head. She can't bear it. Tears running down her
          face.
          Back on his feet, Chang suddenly drops his guard. Julian hesitates,
          confused. Chang leans in close to him. Winks.

                          CHANG
           It wasn't you, was it?
          Julian shrugs, puts his guard up.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)
           You're innocent.

                          JULIAN
           What are you talking about?

                          CHANG
           It's not your fault.
          Chang raises his arms again. Ready to fight. Julian gets ready
          to attack but something's changed. The fire's gone out of him.
          He looks over to his mother, to Mai, Chang's words echoing in
          his mind.
          It's not his fault.
          Then Chang comes in with a flurry of punches. Left, right, left,
          right. Julian just takes them...
          Chang pauses in the onslaught. Julian stays motionless in the
          middle of the ring.
          Chang runs at him, flings his right foot, swivels, pulling out
          a roundhouse left kick -
          - which makes contact with Julian's draw.
          SLOW MOTION as Julian's head takes the impact.
          He's out cold before he hits the floor.

          Jenna hurries down the corridor. She reaches the dressing room
          door. She's about to knock but she stops. She opens the door silently

           He doesn't want to see anyone.
          Mai is disappointed. Doesn't know what to say.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           Just give him time...

                          MAI
           ...tell him I came?

                          JENNA

          Julian turns when he hears a knock at the door. Says nothing.
          Jenna enters and closes the door behind her. She stands there
          for a moment as if considering what to say...

                          JENNA
           You deserved to win. You should've

                          WON--

                          JULIAN
           Give it a break mum. Just... give it
           as rest.
          He steps into the light. She reaches out to touch him.

                          JENNA
           I'll never get use to seeing you get
           hurt - even when you win.

                          JULIAN
           Yeah, well I lost.

                          JENNA
           And did it make a difference?
          Julian says nothing.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           I want to know... Did it make a
           difference?
          Slowly he shakes his head.

                          JULIAN
           ... No... it didn't make a
           difference... No difference at all.

                          JENNA
           And how do you feel now?

                          JULIAN
           Nothing. I don't feel anything at all.

                          JENNA
           Don't you see, that's how I felt when
           Billy died...
          Julian studies his mother.

                          JULIAN
           What do you want, Mum?
          Beat.

                          JENNA
           What d'you think I want? I want it to
           be like it used to be... I don't want
           to lose you...
          Jenna starts crying. Could be real, could be an act - hard to
          tell she's so good...

                          JULIAN
           What's wrong Mum?
          She shakes her head. Can't say it.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           What's wrong?

                          JENNA
           He knows... He knows it was me.

                          JULIAN
           Who does?
          Beat. Jenna says nothing. Julian thinks... Cogs turn...

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           Chang?
          Jenna nods.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           What did you do, Mum? What did you do?
          Jenna makes her hand into a pistol. Pretends to fire it into her
          skull. She tried to have Chang killed. Julian's speechless.

                          JENNA
           He's going to come after me. And after
           he's come after me, he's going to come
           after you.
          Julian stares at his mother; fragile, terrified, alone.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           I'm scared, Julian.
          Julian stares at his mother.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           What are we going to do?
          Julian begins to realize what he has to do... and he looks at
          his hands. Finally...

                          JULIAN
           We'll be okay - I'll do it, I'll take
           him out...

                          JENNA
           Not just him. We've got to take them
           all out.
          Julian stares at her - the power she has over him...

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           Kill them all. The final solution.

           These were new monsters. The woods are
           full of them.
          Chang holds the broken princess' body. A sudden wave of fear washes
          over him. A sense of doom.

          Chang is dressed - finishing putting on his tie - ready for the
          day. He walks into his sitting room as he hears his mobile ring.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           Hello...

           She is in her room...

                          (IN THAI)
           You sure it's her?

           Yes...

                          (IN THAI)
           Good... see you very soon.
          ...and Chang hangs up... The Angel of Vengeance getting ready
          to strike again.

          Chang steps out of his apartment into the hallway where a uniformed
          policeman sits on guard reading a Manga comic.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           What's your name?

           Listen Li Hom. You see anyone you don't
           like... You call me, okay?
          Li Hom nods. Chang leaves.

                          (IN THAI)
           And by the way...
          Chang turns.

           LI HOM (CONT'D)

           Congratulations. Last night. Everyone

          shown. Julian's calling him...

                          JULIAN
           We're outside.

           GORDON (V.O.)
           Sorry mate, something's come up.
          Julian pauses. Can't believe it.

                          JULIAN
           I need you here. Right now.

           GORDON (V.O.)
           I know but... I'm busy. What I'm doing,
           it's important. I'm sorry mate.
          Julian's incredibly frustrated but hasn't got time to argue.

                          JULIAN
           Okay.
          Julian kills his phone. He's still for a moment, then:

          while Kim approaches reception.
          Chang calls the lift and waits. Kim comes back.

                          KIM
           They wont disturb us.
          Chang nods. The elevator door opens.

          INT. CHANG'S APARTMENT - DAY

          Julian is walking around Chang's apartment... looking at all
          family pictures... getting a sense of how they live.
          He opens drawers and closets and studies all the photos of Chang
          as a boxer and soldier.
          ...on a wall is a framed article in Thai that Charlie Ling is
          reading.

                          JULIAN
           What's it say?
          Charlie starts reading the article out:

                          CHARLIE LING
           "Boxing Cop Hero Back From Grave". One
           of Bangkok's finest, blah blah blah,
           came out of a coma that lasted for an
           entire year, waking up as if nothing
           had happened... Wife was really happy,
           blah blah blah... "It's hard to
           describe" Chang said, "but I do feel
           different."
          Charlie starts to sneer as he reads. Julian is listening intently.

           CHARLIE LING (CONT'D)
           "I experienced something
           metaphysical, impossible to
           explain... I travelled to many places
           and saw many things... And when I woke

          Nadee and Kanita come out of the elevator and Nadee quickly sees
          that police guard from before has been replaced by someone else
          (Ko Sam)...
          Ko Sam smiles...

                          KO SAM

                          (IN THAI)
           I'm the new guard. Please, go on in.
          Nadee looks at him suspiciously but enters the apartment with
          Kanita. Ko Sam pretends to go back to reading his Manga comic.

          saucer. Kim is sitting opposite her. Chang stands in the
          background.

                          JENNA
           I came here to collect my son's body.
           Now it's released, my business in
           Bangkok is completed.

           I've had no real contact with Julian
           since he ran away.

                          KIM
           You watched him fight.
          Jenna looks over to Chang.

                          JENNA
           I watched him lose. And he deserved to.
           You were the better fighter. My only
           sadness is that Billy got caught up in
           what he's doing out here. And paid for
           it with his life.
          Kim and the rest of the crew take this in.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           I'll never testify against my own flesh
           and blood, Officer Chang. But he's a
           killer.
          Chang senses something. Starts to become agitated.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           ... It pains me to say it, but my own
           son is a killer. He killed a cop back
           in England ten years ago. He's been on
           the run ever since. I say son... But
           he hasn't been a son to me.
          Chang stares at the door to the bedroom. Feels the presence of
          someone the other side of the door.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           Not for a long time. Not since he killed
           that cop back home... That was ten years
           ago. He's been running ever since. And
           he'll never stop until he's caught.
           Until you catch him.
          Chang starts to push the door open...
          Behind him Jenna stands up.
          Before Chang fully opens the door, his mobile phone rings. It
          sounds INCREDIBLY loud. He takes it out and looks at the display
          with a feeling of dread.
          He answers...

          Charlie Ling kicks open the door. Julian realises he can't let
          him do it.
          And as Charlie Ling sees Kanita... Julian shoots him in the back.
          Charlie Ling slumps to the floor.
          Julian approaches the doorway. He looks in. Sees Kanita sitting
          on her bed. She stares at Julian, Charlie Ling's dead body at
          his feet. They hold each other's gaze... and then Julian slowly

          knocked over outside Choi Yan Lee's kiosk. Candles and incense.
          Buddha's smiling back at him...
          Julian looks around him and again everything seems intense and
          incredibly vibrant... A group of school children, all of whom
          are Downs Syndrome, are crossing the road. Smiles plastered across
          their faces... Julian stares at them... Their presence seems to
          have a calming effect on him, as if they're giving him new energy
          to do what he's starting to realize he has to do next.

          As Julian walks down the corridor he takes the shotgun out - holds
          it out in front of him as if it were a sacred weapon...
          He reaches the door to his mother's room and pauses.
          Julian stares at the door as if it was heaven's gate... He loads
          the shotgun with two fresh cartridges.

                          JULIAN
           Only God forgives. And now mother -
           you will die...
          He rings the bell, raising the shotgun, ready to shoot. The door

                         OPENS -
          - but it's Gordon who opens it, dressed in a bathrobe.
          Confused, Julian continues to level the weapon at his head. Gordon
          backs away into the room.

                          GORDON
           Easy...
          Julian says nothing. Edges into the room. The gun still pointed
          at Gordon's head.
          Julian says nothing. Kicks the door closed with his foot.

                          JULIAN
           Where's is she?

                          GORDON
           She's gone... Picked up Billy's
           body... She's gone home.
          Finally Julian lowers the shotgun.

                          GORDON (CONT'D)
           Didn't she tell you?
          Julian sits down.

                          GORDON (CONT'D)
           You alright mate? D'you want
           something?
          Julian mumbles to himself... then turns to Gordon. Realisation
          dawning on him:

                          JULIAN
           I'm so fucked...

                          CUT TO:

          INT. POLICE STATION / INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

          Kanita sits in a chair, her father standing behind her. Very formal.
          Kim is showing her various head shots of criminals...
          Kanita shakes her head until Chang puts down a picture of Julian.
          She looks up at her father - nods...

                          CUT TO:

          INT. CAR - DAY

          Jenna gazes out of the window. She takes out her compact and adjusts
          her make up.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. BANGKOK - DAY

          Jenna's taxi heads over the Mega Bridge, taking her away towards
          the airport.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. UNDERGROUND CARPARK - DAY

          Gordon and Julian walk towards Gordon's car, the sounds of their
          footsteps ricocheting off the concrete walls.
          Reaching the car, Gordon stands by the driver's door as Julian
          heads for the passenger's side.
          Gordon pauses before unlocking the door. Looks over to Julian,
          talking across the roof of the car.

                          GORDON
           We're good mates aren't we?
          Beat. Julian's instantly suspicious...

                          JULIAN
           ... Yeah.

                          GORDON
           I'm sorry about this Julian. I wish
           there was another way...
          Gordon levels a pistol at Julian's head.

                          JULIAN
           What did she say? What did she promise
           you?

                          GORDON
           Don't make this harder--
          GUNSHOT. A bullet RIPS through Julian's shoulder. He falls back
          on the car behind him setting off a chorus of car alarms.
          Gordon starts to walk round to deliver the killer blow.

                          GORDON (CONT'D)
           You've become a liability. You can see
           that, can't you?
          Julian looks at the wound. It's deep but he's not totally
          incapacitated. He pulls the shotgun out from under his shirt.
          It clatters to the floor.

                          GORDON (CONT'D)
           And now she wants me to take over. She
           wants me to be the favoured son. What
           am I supposed to say?
          Julian sinks to his knees, leaning over to pick up the shotgun.
          He's got seconds...

                          GORDON (CONT'D)
           I didn't want it to end like this. First
           I fuck your mother. Then I--
          Gordon turns the corner - but Julian's in position. Two shots
          in quick succession. Both barrels fired at Gordon's chest.
          The force of the explosion FLINGS Gordon's body against the far
          wall of the car park. Dead instantly.
          Julian pulls himself up and stands there, the smoking shotgun
          acting as a makeshift crutch. He gazes at Gordon's steaming corpse,
          appalled by the turn of events...

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY

          Julian falls out into a side street. He's badly wounded but he's
          going to make it...

                          CUT TO:

          INT. TOILET - DAY

          Julian takes the top off a vodka bottle with his teeth. He pours
          the spirit over his wound. It stings like hell and Julian screams
          in agony.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. BANGKOK STREETS - DUSK

          Julian walks out into the night, the neon glow turning the streets
          into a modern day Hades....
          Although the wound isn't life threatening, Julian's face is pale
          from the loss of blood. He looks like a ghost.
          He sees two cops chatting on a street corner. They don't see him,
          they're not even looking for him, but they remind him. Chang.
          It's just a matter of time...
          Julian keeps walking. Wipes sweat from his face. Looking for a
          place to hide. A hole in the ground. Anything.
          Then suddenly it comes to him. A single idea. A possible way of
          escape...

                          CUT TO:

          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

          A series of napkins are rolled and placed in a steadily growing
          pile.
          The work is being carried out by Mai who has a lowly position
          in a massive and sterile industrial kitchen. Not the sort of life
          she planed on having...
          A Co-Worker calls out to her...

                          CO-WORKER

                          (IN THAI)
           Mai. Some guy's out there asking for
           you.
          Mai finishes the last napkin and places it on the pile. She walks
          towards the exit, passing her Co-Worker...

                          CO-WORKER (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           Don't forget it's supposed to be my
           break next.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Mai comes from round a corner and sees Julian leaning against
          the wall. She checks that they're alone, knowing instinctively
          that he's in trouble.

                          MAI
           What happened to you?
          Beat. Julian almost smiles.

                          JULIAN
           I've got to get out of Bangkok. Didn't
           want to leave...
          He winces.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           ... without saying goodbye.

                          MAI
           Who did this to you?
          A pause.

                          JULIAN
           My mother... She made me what I am. And
           now I've got nothing. And they're after
           me.
          Mai stares at him.

                          MAI
           Come with me...
          Julian looks at her.

                          MAI (CONT'D)
           ...to Cambodia - we can hide there...
           You'll be safe there.
          Mai and Julian smile at each other. It's sweet. Innocent.

                          JULIAN
           I got about twelve grand at the club...
           Should be enough to get us there. Set
           ourselves up. Disappear...

                          MAI
           Now?

                          JULIAN
           Right now.
          Mai looks around - they're alone.

                          MAI
           Wait outside...

                          CUT TO:

          INT. / EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          Julian watches as Mai comes into the Restaurant from the kitchen
          and walks over to the bar area...
          Making sure no one's watching, Mai starts to pull money out of
          the til...
          Julian looks over at the shop front next to him... A Travel Agency.
          Pictures of holidays and beaches. Paradise. It all seems in his
          grasp.
          Mai comes up to him...

                          MAI
           Let's go.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. TAXI - NIGHT

          Mai and Julian are in the Taxi. He puts his arm around her. They're
          on their way...

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. THAI BOXING CLUB - NIGHT

          The taxi pulls up outside Juilan's club.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. TAXI - NIGHT

          Julian gets out of the taxi.

                          JULIAN
           Stay here. If I'm not out in five
           minutes... Go.
          Mai nods.

                          MAI
           Five minutes.
          Julian nods and slams the door shut. Mai watches Juilan disappear
          into the building.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. THAI BOXING CLUB - NIGHT

          We PAN THROUGH Julian's empty club. It's silent and empty like
          a tomb...
          We PICK UP Julian as he hurries through towards his office.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT

          Back where we first met him...
          Julian flings open the door to his safe and starts pulling wads
          of money into a canvas hold all.
          He's about to leave when he notices someone standing in the shadows
          behind him.
          Slowly, out of the darkness, a series of figures appear like
          vampires... Chang and the Cops. Impossible to say how long they've
          been standing there...
          Chang and Julian stare at each other...

                          CHANG
           Let's go.
          We TRACK IN to a CLOSE SHOT on Julian. It's almost as if this
          moment was inevitable.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. THAI BOXING CLUB - NIGHT

          Chang brings Julian out of the club. A police car is waiting outside.
          Mai sits in the back seat.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. BANGKOK - NIGHT

          The police car drives through the city streets and onto the freeway
          heading out of town.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT

          Daeng is driving. Kim sits next to him. Daeng looks into the rearview
          mirror to see--
          Julian and Mai sitting next to Chang. Mai looks scared... Julian
          more accepting of his fate...

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. BANGKOK - NIGHT

          The Police Car heads over the Mega Bridge and continues its way
          out of town.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. CAR - NIGHT

          They all sit in the car in silence.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAWN

          The Police Car pulls up.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

          Chang leads Juilan across the field. The Cops follow a few steps
          behind with Mai.
          Suddenly, and completely unexpectedly, Chang punches Julian in
          the gut... Julian falls to the floor and Chang starts to viciously
          attack him, punching and kicking him.
          Finally Julian, unable to defend himself, is lying on the ground,
          immobile.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           Get up.
          Julian rolls over. Eyes Chang. Slowly he starts to get up onto
          his knees. They continue, Chang forcing Julian to crawl as they
          make their way further into the field.
          Then Chang stops...

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           Get up. Now.
          Julian struggles to get up to his feet, but before he does, Chang
          kicks him hard in the chest, sending him back down to the floor.

                          JULIAN
           I'm sorry...

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           Do you have anything to say?

                          JULIAN
           Don't hurt her.
          He kicks him in the stomach.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           Do you have anything to say?

                          JULIAN
           I'm sorry...
          Chang kicks him again - like you would kick a dog... Juilan groans.
          Chang squats down next to him.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           What do you expect me to do?

                          JULIAN
           I don't know... I'm sorry.
          Chang gets up and walks on. He stops and turns round.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           Come on.
          Julian stumbles to his feet. The party continue. We see that one
          of the crew is carrying an axe.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. FIELD / HIGH POINT - DAWN

          A couple of wild dogs watch as our group reach a high point.
          Chang looks down at Julian who is lying on the ground. The crew
          stand in the background with Mai.
          Chang sits next to Julian.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           When you were born - what's the first
           thing you remember seeing?
          A beat as Julian struggles to understand Chang's question... Chang
          stares at him.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           What do you remember?
          Beat.

                          JULIAN
           Dark... Darkness.
          Chang looks at him in a strange way - like this answer has some
          meaning for him.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           And do you ever see light?
          Julian shakes he's head.

                          JULIAN
           No... Never.
          Chang considers this answer for a long moment. He gets up and
          returns to Mai - stares at her....

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           I am the Angel of Vengeance... I restore
           order and karma. I love all living
           things...
          Mai just stares at him - too frightened to move.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           ...I want you to walk away from here
           now... Do you understand?
          Mai nods.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           Good.
          Chang smiles at her.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           Go with God.
          Mai turns and leaves. Chang watches her disappear into the field.
          Chang takes the axe off Phaiban and turns back to Julian.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. FIELD - DAWN

          Mai walks through the field, alone.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. FIELD / HIGH POINT - DAWN

          Chang leans down next to Julian and whispers something into
          Julian's ear - so softly that we cannot hear it. Whatever it says
          it instantly has an effect on Julian. He visibly relaxes.
          He doesn't make a sound as he's held down. A plastic strap is
          tied around his arm as a tourniquet. His arm is pulled out.
          Chang swings the axe and chops off first his left hand and then
          his right.
          Julian grits his teeth throughout. Doesn't scream.
          Chang picks up the severed hands and throws them to the wild dogs.
          The dogs tear into the meat, fighting over their prize.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. FIELD - DAWN

          Chang and his men walk back towards the car.
          MUSIC KICKS IN once again... the Karaoke version of John Denver's
          country and western ballad...

           CHANG (V.O.)
           Almost heaven, West Virginia
           Blue ridge mountains
           Shenandoah river -
           Life is old there
           Older than the trees
           Younger than the mountains
           Growin' like the breeze.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. BANGKOK - DAY

          We see various scenes of every day life in Bangkok.

           CHANG (V.O.)
           Country roads, take me home
           To the place I belong
           West Virginia, mountain momma
           Take me home, country roads

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. SCHOOL - DAY

          We see kids waiting outside the school for their parents to pick
          them up. Kanita spots Chang, runs towards him and they embrace.

           CHANG (V.O.)
           All my memories gathered round her
           Miners lady, stranger to blue water
           Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
           Misty taste of moonshine
           Teardrops in my eye.
          Chang and Kanita disappear into a crowd of policemen.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT

          Chang is in his element. Singing like a cowboy.

                          CHANG
           Country roads, take me home
           to the place I belong
           West Virginia, mountain momma
           Take me home, country roads..
          The Cops sit and watch him. Their leader... Their God...

                          CUT TO:

          INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

          Julian is lying in hospital. Bandages covering the terrible wounds
          where his hands once were.
          Mai is sitting beside him. Spoon feeding him food.

           CHANG (V.O.)
           I hear my voice
           In the mornin' hour she calls me
           The radio reminds me of my home far away
           And drivin' down the road I get a feelin'
           That I should have been home yesterday,

                          YESTERDAY

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. HEATHROW AIRPORT - DAY

          An aeroplane lands.

           CHANG (V.O.)
           Country roads, take me home
           To the place I belong

                         

          INT. CUSTOMS - DAY

          Jenna is in the process of being strip searched by the authorities.
          Zero dignity.

           CHANG (V.O.)
           West Virginia, mountain momma
           Take me home, country roads
          As one of the Custom's Officers puts on a rubber glove, Jenna
          starts to scream out obscenities at them. Mask off, a real monster
          underneath, flailing around for all to see.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT

          Chang keeps singing.

                          CHANG
           Country roads, take me home
           to the place I belong
           West Virginia, mountain momma
           Take me home, country roads
           Take me home, country roads
           Take me home, country roads

          And we end CLOSE on Chang. With the sense that the 'country roads'
          have kind of taken both of them home...

                          CUT TO:

                         THE END
