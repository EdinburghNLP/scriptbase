Bangkok.
Ten years ago Julian killed a man and went on the run.
Now he manages a Thai boxing club as a front for a drugs operation.
Respected in the criminal underworld, deep inside, he feels empty.
When Julian's brother murders an underage prostitute, the police call on retired cop Chang - the Angel of Vengeance.
Chang allows the father to kill his daughter's murderer, then 'restores order' by chopping off the man's right hand.
Julian's mother Crystal - the head of a powerful criminal organization - arrives in Bangkok to collect her son's body.
She dispatches Julian to find his killers and 'raise hell'.
