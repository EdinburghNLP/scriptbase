               INSERT - A revolving globe. When it stops revolving it turns 
               briefly into a contour map of Europe, then into a flat map.

               Superimposed over this map are scenes of refugees fleeing 
               from all sections of Europe by foot, wagon, auto, and boat, 
               and all converging upon one point on the tip of Africa -- 
               Casablanca.

               Arrows on the map illustrate the routes taken as the voice 
               of a NARRATOR describes the migration.

                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
                         With the coming of the Second World 
                         War, many eyes in imprisoned Europe 
                         turned hopefully, or desperately, 
                         toward the freedom of the Americas. 
                         Lisbon became the great embarkation 
                         point. But not everybody could get 
                         to Lisbon directly, and so, a 
                         tortuous, roundabout refugee trail 
                         sprang up. Paris to Marseilles, across 
                         the Mediterranean to Oran, then by 
                         train, or auto, or foot, across the 
                         rim of Africa to Casablanca in French 
                         Morocco. Here, the fortunate ones, 
                         through money, or influence, or luck, 
                         might obtain exit visas and scurry 
                         to Lisbon, and from Lisbon to the 
                         New World. But the others wait in 
                         Casablanca -- and wait -- and wait -- 
                         and wait.

               At first only the turrets and rooftops are visible against a 
               torrid sky.

               The facades of the Moorish buildings give way to a narrow, 
               twisting street crowded with the polyglot life of a native 
               quarter. The intense desert sun holds the scene in a torpid 
               tranquillity. Activity is unhurried and sounds are muted.

               EXT. A STREET IN THE OLD MOORISH SECTION - DAY

               An officer BLOWS his whistle several times.

               There is pandemonium as native guards begin to round up 
               people.

               A police car, full of officers, with SIREN BLARING, screams 
               through the street and stops in the market.

               Some try to escape but are caught by the police and loaded 
               into a police wagon.

               At a street corner TWO POLICEMEN stop a white CIVILIAN and 
               question him.

                                     FIRST POLICEMAN
                         May we see your papers?

                                     CIVILIAN
                         (nervously)
                         I don't think I have them on me.

                                     FIRST POLICEMAN
                         In that case, we'll have to ask you 
                         to come along.

               The civilian pats his pockets.

                                     CIVILIAN
                         Wait. It's just possible that I... 
                         Yes, here they are.

               He brings out his papers. The second policeman examines them.

                                     SECOND POLICEMAN
                         These papers expired three weeks 
                         ago. You'll have to come along.

               Suddenly the civilian breaks away and starts to run wildly 
               down the street.

               The policeman SHOUTS "Halt", but the civilian keeps going.

               JAN and ANNINA BRANDEL, a very young and attractive refugee 
               couple from Bulgaria, watch as the civilian passes. They've 
               been thrust by circumstances from a simple country life into 
               an unfamiliar and hectic world.

               A shot RINGS out, and the man falls to the ground. Above 
               him, painted on the wall, is a large poster of Marshal Petain, 
               which reads: "Je tiens mes promesses, meme celles des autres."

               The policeman frantically searches the body, but only finds 
               Free French literature.

               We see the the facade, French in architecture, then the 
               highvaulted entrance which is inscribed "Palais de Justice".

               At the entrance the arrested suspects are led in by the

               A middle-aged ENGLISH COUPLE sit at a table just off the 
               square, and observe the commotion across the way in front of 
               the Palais de Justice.

               The police van pulls up. The rear doors are opened and people 
               stream out.

               A EUROPEAN man, sitting at a table nearby, watches the English 
               couple more closely than the scene on the street.

                                     ENGLISHWOMAN
                         What on earth's going on there?

                         I don't know, my dear.

               The European walks over to the couple.

                                     EUROPEAN
                         Pardon, pardon, Monsieur, pardon

                                     ENGLISHMAN
                         We hear very little, and we understand 
                         even less.

                         unoccupied desert. This is the 
                         customary roundup of refugees, 
                         liberals, and uh, of course, a 
                         beautiful young girl for Monsieur 
                         Renault, the Prefect of Police.

                         Unfortunately, along with these 
                         unhappy refugees the scum of Europe 
                         has gravitated to Casablanca. Some 
                         of them have been waiting years for 
                         a visa.

               He puts his left arm compassionately around the Englishman, 
               and reaches behind the man with his right hand.

                                     EUROPEAN
                         I beg of you, Monsieur, watch

                         full of vultures, vultures everywhere, 
                         everywhere.

               The Englishman seems to be taken aback by this sudden display 
               of concern.

                                     ENGLISHMAN
                         Ha, ha, thank you, thank you very 
                         much.

                         revoir, Madame.

               He leaves. The Englishman, still a trifle disconcerted by 
               the European's action, watches him as he leaves.

                                     ENGLISHMAN
                         Au revoir. Amusing little fellow. 
                         Waiter!

               As he pats both his breast and pants pockets he realizes 
               there is something missing.

                                     ENGLISHMAN
                         Oh. How silly of me.

                         I've left my wallet in the hotel.

                         Oh.

               Suddenly the Englishman looks off in the direction of the 
               departed European, the clouds of suspicion gathering.

               Interrupting overhead is the DRONE of a low flying airplane.

               Refugees wait in line outside the Palais de Justice. Their

               is the symbol of that hope.

               Jan and Annina look up at the plane.

               As the plane lands a swastika on its tail is clearly visible. 
               It taxis to a stop as a group of officers march into formation 
               in front of it. Behind them stand a detail of native soldiers 
               keeping guard.

               In the group is CAPTAIN LOUIS RENAULT, a French officer 
               appointed by Vichy as Prefect of Police in Casablanca. He is 
               a handsome, middle-aged Frenchman, debonair and gay, but 
               withal a shrewd and alert official.

               With him are HERR HEINZE, the German consul, CAPTAIN TONELLI, 
               an Italian officer, and LIEUTENANT CASSELLE, Renault's aide.

               When the plane door opens, the first passenger to step out 
               is a tall, middle-aged, pale German with a smile that seems 
               more the result of a frozen face muscle than a cheerful 
               disposition. On any occasion when MAJOR STRASSER is crossed, 
               his expression hardens into iron.

               Herr Heinze steps up to him with upraised arm.

                                     HEINZE
                         Heil Hitler.

                                     STRASSER
                         Heil Hitler.

               They shake hands.

                                     HEINZE
                         It is very good to see you again, 
                         Major Strasser.

                                     STRASSER
                         Thank you. Thank you.

               Heinze introduces Strasser to Renault.

                                     HEINZE
                         May I present Captain Renault, Police 
                         Prefect of Casablanca. Major Strasser.

               Renault salutes.

                                     RENAULT
                         Unoccupied France welcomes you to 
                         Casablanca.

                                     STRASSER
                         (in perfect English, 
                         smiling)
                         Thank you, Captain. It's very good 
                         to be here.

                         Major Strasser, my aide, Lieutenant 
                         Casselle.

               As they acknowledge each other, Captain Tonelli barges in 
               front of Casselle and salutes Strasser.

                                     TONELLI
                         Captain Tonelli, the Italian service, 
                         at your command, Major.

                                     STRASSER
                         That is kind of you.

               But Tonelli gets no further than that as Strasser turns again 
               to Renault. They walk away from the plane, Heinze following, 
               with Casselle and Tonelli bringing up the rear, engaged in a 
               heated exchange of words.

                                     RENAULT
                         You may find the climate of Casablanca 
                         a trifle warm, Major.

                                     STRASSER
                         Oh, we Germans must get used to all 
                         climates, from Russia to the Sahara. 
                         But perhaps you were not referring 
                         to the weather.

                                     RENAULT
                         (sidesteps the 
                         implication with a 
                         smile)
                         What else, my dear Major?

                                     STRASSER
                         (casually)
                         By the way, the murder of the 
                         couriers, what has been done?

                                     RENAULT
                         Realizing the importance of the case, 
                         my men are rounding up twice the 
                         usual number of suspects.

                                     HEINZE
                         We already know who the murderer is.

                                     STRASSER
                         Good. Is he in custody?

                                     RENAULT
                         Oh, there is no hurry. Tonight he'll 
                         be at Rick's. Everybody comes to 
                         Rick's.

                                     STRASSER
                         I have already heard about this cafe, 
                         and also about Mr. Rick himself.

               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. RICK'S CAFE - NIGHT

               The neon sign above the door is brightly lit. Customers arrive 
               and go in through the front door. From inside we hear sounds 
               of MUSIC and LAUGHTER. The song is "It Had to Be You."

               Again we isolate on the neon sign.

               INSERT SIGN: "Rick's Cafe Americain".

               We follow a group of customers inside.

               INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

               Rick's is an expensive and chic nightclub which definitely 
               possesses an air of sophistication and intrigue.

               SAM, a middle-aged Negro, sits on a stool before a small, 
               salmon-colored piano on wheels, playing and singing while 
               accompanied by a small orchestra.

               All about him there is the HUM of voices, CHATTER and 
               LAUGHTER.

               The occupants of the room are varied. There are Europeans in 
               their dinner jackets, their women beautifully begowned and 
               bejeweled. There are Moroccans in silk robes. Turks wearing 
               fezzes. Levantines. Naval officers. Members of the Foreign 
               Legion, distinguished by their kepis.

               Two men sit at a table.

                                     MAN
                         Waiting, waiting, waiting. I'll never 
                         get out of here. I'll die in 
                         Casablanca.

               His companion seems uninterested in his dilemma. Sympathy is 
               evidently in short supply in Casablanca.

               At another table a very well-dressed WOMAN talks to a MOOR. 
               She has a bracelet on her wrist. No other jewelry.

                                     WOMAN
                         But can't you make it just a little 
                         more? Please.

                                     MOOR
                         I'm sorry, Madame, but diamonds are 
                         a drug on the market. Everybody sells 
                         diamonds. There are diamonds 
                         everywhere. Two thousand, four 
                         hundred.

                                     WOMAN
                         All right.

               On to another table where two CONSPIRATORS talk.

                                     CONSPIRATOR
                         The trucks are waiting, the men are 
                         waiting. Everything is...

               He stops abruptly as two German officers walk by.

               A REFUGEE and another MAN converse at another table.

                                     MAN
                         It's the fishing smack Santiago. It 
                         leaves at one tomorrow night, here 
                         from the end of La Medina. Third 
                         boat.

                                     REFUGEE
                         Thank you, oh, thank you.

                                     MAN
                         And bring fifteen thousand francs in 
                         cash. Remember, in cash.

               On the way to the bar we pass several tables and hear a Babel 
               of foreign tongues. Here and there we catch a scattered phrase 
               or sentence in English.

               SACHA, a friendly young Russian bartender, hands a drink to 
               a customer with the Russian equivalent of "Bottoms Up." The 
               customer answers with "Cheerio."

               CARL, the waiter, is a fat, jovial German refugee with 
               spectacles. He walks, tray in hand, to a private door, over 
               which ABDUL, a large, burly man, stands guard.

                                     CARL
                         Open up, Abdul.

                                     ABDUL
                         (respectfully)
                         Yes, Herr Professor.

               Abdul opens the door and Carl goes into the gambling room.

               INT. RICK'S CAFE - GAMBLING ROOM - NIGHT

               Their is much activity at the various tables. At one table 
               TWO WOMEN and a MAN play cards. They glance at another table.

               One of them calls to Carl.

                                     FIRST WOMAN
                         Uh, waiter.

                                     CARL
                         Yes, Madame?

                                     FIRST WOMAN
                         Will you ask Rick if he'll have a 
                         drink with us?

                                     CARL
                         Madame, he never drinks with 
                         customers. Never. I have never seen 
                         him.

                                     SECOND WOMAN
                         (disappointedly)
                         What makes saloon-keepers so snobbish?

                                     MAN
                         (to Carl)
                         Perhaps if you told him I ran the 
                         second largest banking house in 
                         Amsterdam.

                                     CARL
                         The second largest? That wouldn't 
                         impress Rick. The leading banker in 
                         Amsterdam is now the pastry chef in 
                         our kitchen.

                                     MAN
                         We have something to look forward 
                         to.

                                     CARL
                         And his father is the bell boy.

               Carl laughs.

               The overseer walks up to a table with a paper in his hand.

               Then we see a drink and a man's hand, but nothing more. The 
               overseer places a check on the table. The hand picks up the 
               check and writes on it, in pencil, "Okay-Rick."

               The overseer takes the check.

               We now see RICK, sitting at a table alone playing solitary 
               chess. Rick is an American of indeterminate age. There is no 
               expression on his face -- complete deadpan.

               There is a commotion at the door as people attempt to come 
               into the gambling room. He nods approval to Abdul.

               Then a GERMAN appears in the doorway. Abdul looks to Rick 
               who glances back toward the open door and nods "no".

               Abdul starts to close the door on the man.

                                     ABDUL
                         I'm sorry sir, this is a private 
                         room.

                                     GERMAN
                         Of all the nerve! Who do you think... 
                         I know there's gambling in there! 
                         There's no secret. You dare not keep 
                         me out of here!

               The man tries to push his way through the door as Rick walks 
               up.

                                     RICK
                         (coldly)
                         Yes? What's the trouble?

                                     ABDUL
                         This gentleman --

               The German interrupts and waves his card.

                                     GERMAN
                         I've been in every gambling room 
                         between Honolulu and Berlin and if 
                         you think I'm going to be kept out 
                         of a saloon like this, you're very 
                         much mistaken.

               At this moment UGARTE, a small, thin man with a nervous air, 
               tries to squeeze through the doorway blocked by the German.

               If he were an American, Ugarte would look like a tout.

               He gets through and passes Rick.

                                     UGARTE
                         Uh, excuse me, please. Hello, Rick.

                                     RICK
                         (softly)
                         Hello Ugarte.

               Rick looks at the German calmly, takes the card out of his 
               hand, and tears it up.

                                     RICK
                         Your cash is good at the bar.

                                     GERMAN
                         What! Do you know who I am?

                                     RICK
                         I do. You're lucky the bar's open to 
                         you.

                                     GERMAN
                         This is outrageous. I shall report 
                         it to the Angriff!

               The German storms off, tossing the pieces of his card into 
               the air behind him.

               Rick meets Ugarte on his way back to his table.

                                     UGARTE
                         (fawning)
                         Huh. You know, Rick, watching you 
                         just now with the Deutsches Bank, 
                         one would think you'd been doing 
                         this all your life.

                                     RICK
                         (stiffening)
                         Well, what makes you think I haven't?

                                     UGARTE
                         (vaguely)
                         Oh, nothing. But when you first came 
                         to Casablanca, I thought --

                                     RICK
                         (coldly)
                         -- You thought what?

               Fearing to offend Rick, Ugarte laughs.

                                     UGARTE
                         What right do I have to think?

               Ugarte pulls out a chair at Rick's table.

                                     UGARTE
                         May I? Too bad about those two German 
                         couriers, wasn't it?

                                     RICK
                         (indifferently)
                         They got a lucky break. Yesterday 
                         they were just two German clerks. 
                         Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.

                                     UGARTE
                         You are a very cynical person, Rick, 
                         if you'll forgive me for saying so.

               Ugarte sits down.

                                     RICK
                         (shortly)
                         I forgive you.

               A waiter comes up to the table with a tray of drinks. He 
               places one before Ugarte.

                                     UGARTE
                         Thank you.
                         (to Rick)
                         Will you have a drink with me please?

                                     RICK
                         No.

                                     UGARTE
                         I forgot. You never drink with...
                         (to waiter)
                         I'll have another, please.
                         (to Rick, sadly)
                         You despise me, don't you?

                                     RICK
                         (indifferently)
                         If I gave you any thought, I probably 
                         would.

                                     UGARTE
                         But why? Oh, you object to the kind 
                         of business I do, huh? But think of 
                         all those poor refugees who must rot 
                         in this place if I didn't help them. 
                         That's not so bad. Through ways of 
                         my own I provide them with exit visas.

                                     RICK
                         For a price, Ugarte, for a price.

                                     UGARTE
                         But think of all the poor devils who 
                         cannot meet Renault's price. I get 
                         it for them for half. Is that so 
                         parasitic?

                                     RICK
                         I don't mind a parasite. I object to 
                         a cut-rate one.

                                     UGARTE
                         Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be 
                         through with the whole business, and 
                         I am leaving finally this Casablanca.

                                     RICK
                         Who did you bribe for your visa? 
                         Renault or yourself?

                                     UGARTE
                         (ironically)
                         Myself. I found myself much more 
                         reasonable.

               He takes an envelope from his pocket and lays it on the table.

                                     UGARTE
                         Look, Rick, do you know what this 
                         is? Something that even you have 
                         never seen. Letters of transit signed 
                         by General de Gaulle. Cannot be 
                         rescinded, not even questioned.

               Rick appears ready to take them from Ugarte.

                                     UGARTE
                         One moment. Tonight I'll be selling 
                         those for more money than even I 
                         have ever dreamed of, and then, addio 
                         Casablanca! You know, Rick, I have 
                         many friends in Casablanca, but 
                         somehow, just because you despise me 
                         you're the only one I trust. Will 
                         you keep these for me? Please.

                                     RICK
                         For how long?

                                     UGARTE
                         Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little 
                         longer.

                                     RICK
                         I don't want them here overnight.

                                     UGARTE
                         Don't be afraid of that. Please keep 
                         them for me. Thank you. I knew I 
                         could trust you.

               Rick takes them. Ugarte leaves the table just as the waiter 
               comes up.

                                     UGARTE
                         Oh, waiter. I'll be expecting some 
                         people. If anybody asks for me, I'll 
                         be right here.

                                     WAITER
                         Yes, Monsieur.

               The waiter leaves. Ugarte turns to Rick.

                                     UGARTE
                         Rick, I hope you are more impressed 
                         with me now, huh? If you'll forgive 
                         me, I'll share my good luck with 
                         your roulette wheel.

               He starts across the floor.

                                     RICK
                         Just a moment.

               Ugarte stops as Rick comes up to him.

                                     RICK
                         Yeah, I heard a rumor that those 
                         German couriers were carrying letters 
                         of transit.

               Ugarte hesitates for a moment.

                                     UGARTE
                         Huh? I heard that rumor, too. Poor 
                         devils.

               Rick looks at Ugarte steadily.

                                     RICK
                         (slowly)
                         Yes, you're right, Ugarte. I am a 
                         little more impressed with you.

               Rick leaves the gambling room and goes into the main room.

               CUT TO:

               INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

               Rick makes his way over to Sam, who plays and sings the "Knock 
               Wood" number, accompanied by the orchestra. The cafe is in 
               semi-darkness. The spotlight is on Sam, and every time the 
               orchestra comes in on the "Knock Wood" business, the spotlight 
               swings over to the orchestra.

               During one of the periods when the spotlight is on the 
               orchestra, Rick slips the letters of transit into the piano.

               FERRARI, owner of the Blue Parrot, a competing night spot, 
               comes into the cafe, sits down, and watches Sam.

               Then he sees Rick and they smile at each other. At the end 
               of the number Ferrari goes to the bar to speak to Rick.

                                     FERRARI
                         Hello, Rick.

                                     RICK
                         Hello, Ferrari. How's business at 
                         the Blue Parrot?

                                     FERRARI
                         Fine, but I would like to buy your 
                         cafe.

                                     RICK
                         It's not for sale.

                                     FERRARI
                         You haven't heard my offer.

                                     RICK
                         It's not for sale at any price.

                                     FERRARI
                         What do you want for Sam?

                                     RICK
                         I don't buy or sell human beings.

                                     FERRARI
                         That's too bad. That's Casablanca's 
                         leading commodity. In refugees alone 
                         we could make a fortune if you would 
                         work with me through the black market.

                                     RICK
                         Suppose you run your business and 
                         let me run mine.

                                     FERRARI
                         Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like 
                         to make a change.

                                     RICK
                         Suppose we do.

                                     FERRARI
                         My dear Rick, when will you realize 
                         that in this world today isolationism 
                         is no longer a practical policy?

               Rick and Ferrari walk over to the piano.

                                     RICK
                         Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for 
                         him at the Blue Parrot.

                                     SAM
                         I like it fine here.

                                     RICK
                         He'll double what I pay you.

                                     SAM
                         Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend 
                         the money I make here.

                                     RICK
                         Sorry.

               Apparently satisfied, Ferrari walks away.

               Back at the bar, YVONNE, an attractive young French woman, 
               sits on a stool drinking brandy.

               Sacha, who looks at her with lovesick eyes, fills her tumbler.

                                     SACHA
                         The boss's private stock. Because, 
                         Yvonne, I loff you.

                                     YVONNE
                         (morosely)
                         Oh, shut up.

                                     SACHA
                         (fondly)
                         All right, all right. For you, Yvonne, 
                         I shot opp, because, Yvonne, I loff 
                         you. Uh oh.

               Rick saunters over and leans on the bar, next to Yvonne.

               He pays no attention to her. She looks at him bitterly, 
               without saying a word.

                                     SACHA
                         Oh, Monsieur Rick, Monsieur Rick. 
                         Some Germans, boom, boom, boom, boom, 
                         gave this check. Is it all right?

               Rick looks the check over and tears it up. Yvonne has never 
               taken her eyes off Rick.

                                     YVONNE
                         Where were you last night?

                                     RICK
                         That's so long ago, I don't remember.

                                     YVONNE
                         Will I see you tonight?

                                     RICK
                         (matter-of-factly)
                         I never make plans that far ahead.

               Yvonne turns, looks at Sacha, and extends her glass to him.

                                     YVONNE
                         Give me another.

                                     RICK
                         Sacha, she's had enough.

                                     YVONNE
                         Don't listen to him, Sacha. Fill it 
                         up.

                                     SACHA
                         Yvonne, I loff you, but he pays me.

               Yvonne wheels on Rick with drunken fury.

                                     YVONNE
                         Rick, I'm sick and tired of having 
                         you --

                                     RICK
                         -- Sacha, call a cab.

                                     SACHA
                         Yes, boss.

               Rick takes Yvonne by the arm.

                                     RICK
                         Come on, we're going to get your 
                         coat.

                                     YVONNE
                         Take your hands off me!

               He pulls her along toward the door.

                                     RICK
                         No. You're going home. You've had a 
                         little too much to drink.

               CUT TO:

               EXT. RICK'S CAFE - NIGHT

               Sacha stands at the curb on the street in front of Rick's 
               and signals for a cab.

                                     SACHA
                         Taxi!

               Soon one pulls up.

               Rick and Yvonne come out of the cafe. He puts a coat over 
               her shoulders and she objects violently.

                                     YVONNE
                         Who do you think you are, pushing me 
                         around? What a fool I was to fall 
                         for a man like you.

               Rick and Yvonne approach the waiting cab.

                                     RICK
                         (to Sacha)
                         You'd better go with her, Sacha, to 
                         be sure she gets home.

                                     SACHA
                         Yes, boss.

                                     RICK
                         And come right back.

                                     SACHA
                         (his face falling)
                         Yes, boss.

               Rick stands and looks up at the revolving beacon light from 
               the airport. It intermittently sheds its light on Rick's 
               face.

               Renault sits at a table on the cafe terrace, watching this 
               evening's performance.

                                     RENAULT
                         Hello, Rick.

               Rick walks over to him.

                                     RICK
                         Hello, Louis.

                                     RENAULT
                         How extravagant you are, throwing 
                         away women like that. Someday they 
                         may be scarce.

               Rick sits down at the table.

                                     RENAULT
                         (amused)
                         You know, I think now I shall pay a 
                         call on Yvonne, maybe get her on the 
                         rebound, eh?

                                     RICK
                         When it comes to women, you're a 
                         true democrat.

               As they talk, Captain Tonelli and Lieutenant Casselle walk 
               by toward the entrance of the cafe. Casselle talks non-stop 
               and Tonelli tries. They both stop, salute Renault, and walk 
               into the cafe.

                                     RENAULT
                         If he gets a word in it'll be a major 
                         Italian victory.

               Rick laughs.

               Rick and Renault look up when they hear the BUZZ of a plane 
               taking off from the adjacent airfield. The plane flies 
               directly over their heads.

                                     RENAULT
                         The plane to Lisbon.
                         (pause)
                         You would like to be on it?

                                     RICK
                         (curtly)
                         Why? What's in Lisbon?

                                     RENAULT
                         The clipper to America.

               Rick doesn't answer. His look isn't a happy one.

                                     RENAULT
                         I have often speculated on why you 
                         don't return to America. Did you 
                         abscond with the church funds? Did 
                         you run off with a senator's wife? I 
                         like to think you killed a man. It's 
                         the romantic in me.

               Rick still looks in the direction of the airport.

                                     RICK
                         It was a combination of all three.

                                     RENAULT
                         And what in heaven's name brought 
                         you to Casablanca?

                                     RICK
                         My health. I came to Casablanca for 
                         the waters.

                                     RENAULT
                         Waters? What waters? We're in the 
                         desert.

                                     RICK
                         I was misinformed.

                                     RENAULT
                         Huh!

               EMIL, the croupier, comes out of the cafe and walks over to 
               Rick.

                                     EMIL
                         Excuse me, Monsieur Rick, but a 
                         gentleman inside has won twenty 
                         thousand francs. The cashier would 
                         like some money.

                                     RICK
                         Well, I'll get it from the safe.

                                     EMIL
                         I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You 
                         know I can't understand --

                                     RICK
                         -- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like 
                         that happen all the time.

                                     EMIL
                         I'm awfully sorry.

               The three men enter the cafe.

               CUT TO:

               INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

               They pass Sam at the piano. He's playing "Baby Face". Rick 
               pats Sam on the shoulder.

                                     RENAULT
                         Rick, there's going to be some 
                         excitement here tonight. We are going 
                         to make an arrest in your cafe.

                                     RICK
                         (somewhat annoyed)
                         What, again?

                                     RENAULT
                         This is no ordinary arrest. A 
                         murderer, no less.

               Rick's eyes react. Involuntarily, they glance toward the 
               gambling room.

               Renault catches the look.

                                     RENAULT
                         If you are thinking of warning him, 
                         don't put yourself out. He cannot 
                         possibly escape.

                                     RICK
                         I stick my neck out for nobody.

                                     RENAULT
                         A wise foreign policy.

               They start upstairs to Rick's office, passing Casselle who 
               is still haranguing Tonelli.

                                     RENAULT
                         You know, Rick, we could have made 
                         this arrest earlier in the evening 
                         at the Blue Parrot, but out of my 
                         high regard for you we are staging 
                         it here. It will amuse your customers.

                                     RICK
                         Our entertainment is enough.

               They go inside the office.

               INT. RICK'S CAFE - OFFICE - NIGHT

               Rick opens up the safe in a small, dark room just off the 
               office. Only Rick's shadow can be seen getting the money 
               out.

                                     RENAULT
                         Rick, we are to have an important 
                         guest tonight, Major Strasser of the 
                         Third Reich, no less. We want him to 
                         be here when we make the arrest. A 
                         little demonstration of the efficiency 
                         of my administration.

               Rick moves out of the shadows and into view.

                                     RICK
                         I see. And what's Strasser doing 
                         here? He certainly didn't come all 
                         the way to Casablanca to witness a 
                         demonstration of your efficiency.

                                     RENAULT
                         Perhaps not.

               He gives the money to Emil.

                                     RICK
                         Here you are.

                                     EMIL
                         It shall not happen again, Monsieur.

                                     RICK
                         That's all right.

               Emil departs.

                                     RICK
                         Louis, you've got something on your 
                         mind. Why don't you spill it?

               Rick closes the door to the office, then goes over to close 
               the safe.

                                     RENAULT
                         How observant you are. As a matter 
                         of fact, I wanted to give you a word 
                         of advice.

                                     RICK
                         Yeah? Have a brandy?

                                     RENAULT
                         Thank you. Rick, there are many exit 
                         visas sold in this cafe, but we know 
                         that you have never sold one. That 
                         is the reason we permit you to remain 
                         open.

                                     RICK
                         I thought it was because we let you 
                         win at roulette.

                                     RENAULT
                         That is another reason. There is a 
                         man who's arrived in Casablanca on 
                         his way to America. He will offer a 
                         fortune to anyone who will furnish 
                         him with an exit visa.

                                     RICK
                         Yeah? What's his name?

                                     RENAULT
                         Victor Laszlo.

                                     RICK
                         Victor Laszlo?

               Renault watches Rick's reaction.

                                     RENAULT
                         Rick, that is the first time I have 
                         ever seen you so impressed.

                                     RICK
                         Well, he's succeeded in impressing 
                         half the world.

                                     RENAULT
                         It is my duty to see that he doesn't 
                         impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo 
                         must never reach America. He stays 
                         in Casablanca.

                                     RICK
                         It'll be interesting to see how he 
                         manages.

                                     RENAULT
                         Manages what?

                                     RICK
                         His escape.

                                     RENAULT
                         Oh, but I just told you. --

                                     RICK
                         -- Stop it. He escaped from a 
                         concentration camp and the Nazis 
                         have been chasing him all over Europe.

                                     RENAULT
                         This is the end of the chase.

                                     RICK
                         Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.

               They sit down to discuss the matter in earnest.

                                     RENAULT
                         Is that a serious offer?

                                     RICK
                         I just paid out twenty. I'd like to 
                         get it back.

                                     RENAULT
                         Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt 
                         official.

                                     RICK
                         Okay.

                                     RENAULT
                         Done. No matter how clever he is, he 
                         still needs an exit visa, or I should 
                         say, two.

                                     RICK
                         Why two?

                                     RENAULT
                         He is traveling with a lady.

                                     RICK
                         He'll take one.

                                     RENAULT
                         I think not. I have seen the lady. 
                         And if he did not leave her in 
                         Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly 
                         won't leave her in Casablanca.

                                     RICK
                         Maybe he's not quite as romantic as 
                         you are.

                                     RENAULT
                         It doesn't matter. There is no exit 
                         visa for him.

                                     RICK
                         Louis, whatever gave you the 
                         impression that I might be interested 
                         in helping Laszlo escape?

                                     RENAULT
                         Because, my dear Ricky, I suspect 
                         that under that cynical shell you're 
                         at heart a sentimentalist.

               Rick makes a face.

                                     RENAULT
                         Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen 
                         to be familiar with your record. Let 
                         me point out just two items. In 1935 
                         you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, 
                         you fought in Spain on the Loyalist 
                         side.

                                     RICK
                         And got well paid for it on both 
                         occasions.

                         The winning side would have paid you 
                         much better.

                                     RICK
                         Maybe. Well, it seems you are 
                         determined to keep Laszlo here.

                                     RENAULT
                         I have my orders.

                                     RICK
                         Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.

               Renault stands up.

                                     RENAULT
                         My dear Ricky, you overestimate the 
                         influence of the Gestapo. I don't 
                         interfere with them and they don't 
                         interfere with me. In Casablanca I 
                         am master of my fate. I am captain 
                         of my --

               He stops short as his AIDE enters.

                                     AIDE
                         -- Major Strasser is here, sir.

               Renault starts to leave.

                                     RICK
                         Yeah, you were saying?

                                     RENAULT
                         (hurriedly)
                         Excuse me.

               He hurries away. Rick smiles cynically.

               CUT TO:

               INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

               Renault walks up to Carl.

                                     RENAULT
                         Carl, see that Major Strasser gets a 
                         good table, one close to the ladies.

                                     CARL
                         I have already given him the best, 
                         knowing he is German and would take 
                         it anyway.

               Renault walks over to one of his officers.

                                     RENAULT
                         Take him quietly. Two guards at every 
                         door.

                                     OFFICER
                         Yes, sir. Everything is ready, sir.

               The officer salutes and goes off to speak to the guards.

               Renault walks over to Strasser's table as Rick comes down 
               the stairs.

                                     RENAULT
                         Good evening, gentlemen.

                                     STRASSER
                         Good evening, Captain.

                                     HEINZE
                         Won't you join us?

               Renault sits down.

                                     RENAULT
                         Thank you. It is a pleasure to have 
                         you here, Major.

                                     STRASSER
                         (to the waiter)
                         Champagne and a tin of caviar.

                                     RENAULT
                         May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a 
                         good French wine.

                                     STRASSER
                         Thank you.

                                     WAITER
                         Very well, sir.

                                     STRASSER
                         A very interesting club.

                                     RENAULT
                         Especially so tonight, Major. In a 
                         few minutes you will see the arrest 
                         of the man who murdered your couriers.

                                     STRASSER
                         I expected no less, Captain.

               CUT TO:

               INT. RICK'S CAFE - GAMBLING ROOM - NIGHT

               Ugarte stands at the roulette table. Two gendarmes approach 
               him from behind.

                                     GENDARME
                         Monsieur Ugarte?

               Ugarte looks around.

                                     UGARTE
                         Oh. Yes?

                                     GENDARME
                         Will you please come with us.

                                     UGARTE
                         Certainly. May I first please cash 
                         my chips?

               The officer nods. They follow Ugarte to the cashier's window. 
               Ugarte puts his chips through the window to the CASHIER.

                                     UGARTE
                         Pretty lucky, huh? Two thousand, 
                         please.

               Two more guards station themselves at the door in case there 
               is trouble.

                                     CASHIER
                         Two thousand.

                                     UGARTE
                         Thank you.

               Ugarte starts to walk out, followed by the gendarmes. When 
               he reaches the doorway he suddenly rushes through and slams 
               the door behind himself.

               INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

               By the time the gendarmes manage to get the door open again, 
               Ugarte has pulled a gun.

               He FIRES at the doorway. The SHOTS bring on pandemonium in 
               the cafe.

               As Ugarte runs through the hallway he sees Rick, appearing 
               from the opposite direction, and grabs him.

                                     UGARTE
                         Rick! Rick, help me!

                                     RICK
                         Don't be a fool. You can't get away.

                                     UGARTE
                         Rick, hide me. Do something! You 
                         must help me, Rick. Do something!

               Guards and gendarmes rush in and grab Ugarte. Rick stands 
               impassively as they drag Ugarte off.

                                     UGARTE
                         Rick! Rick!

               We move to Strasser's table, who has witnessed the event.

                                     STRASSER
                         Excellent, Captain.

               Back to Rick, still standing where he was, as a CUSTOMER 
               walks by.

                                     CUSTOMER
                         When they come to get me, Rick, I 
                         hope you'll be more of a help.

                                     RICK
                         I stick my neck out for nobody.

               Rick comes out to the middle of the floor. An air of tense 
               expectancy pervades the room. A few customers are on the 
               point of leaving. Rick speaks in a very calm voice.

                                     RICK
                         I'm sorry there was a disturbance, 
                         folks, but it's all over now. 
                         Everything's all right. Just sit 
                         down and have a good time. Enjoy 
                         yourself.

               Rick glances toward Sam.

                                     RICK
                         All right, Sam.

               Sam nods and begins to play.

               Renault, Strasser, and Heinze sit calmly at their table after 
               witnessing the arrest.

               Rick walks by.

                                     RENAULT
                         (calling to Rick)
                         Oh, Rick?

               Rick stops and comes over to their table.

                                     RENAULT
                         Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser 
                         of the Third Reich.

                                     STRASSER
                         How do you do, Mr. Rick?

                                     RICK
                         Oh, how do you do?

                                     RENAULT
                         And you already know Herr Heinze of 
                         the Third Reich.

               Rick nods to Strasser and Heinze.

                                     STRASSER
                         Please join us, Mr. Rick.

               Rick sits down with them.

                                     RENAULT
                         We are very honored tonight, Rick.

               Major Strasser is one of the reasons the Third Reich enjoys 
               the reputation it has today.

                                     STRASSER
                         You repeat "Third Reich" as though 
                         you expected there to be others.

                                     RENAULT
                         Well, personally, Major, I will take 
                         what comes.

                                     STRASSER
                         (to Rick)
                         Do you mind if I ask you a few 
                         questions? Unofficially, of course.

                                     RICK
                         Make it official, if you like.

                                     STRASSER
                         What is your nationality?

                                     RICK
                         (pokerfaced)
                         I'm a drunkard.

                                     RENAULT
                         That makes Rick a citizen of the 
                         world.

                                     RICK
                         I was born in New York City if that'll 
                         help you any.

                                     STRASSER
                         I understand you came here from Paris 
                         at the time of the occupation.

                                     RICK
                         There seems to be no secret about 
                         that.

                                     STRASSER
                         Are you one of those people who cannot 
                         imagine the Germans in their beloved 
                         Paris?

                                     RICK
                         It's not particularly my beloved 
                         Paris.

                                     HEINZE
                         Can you imagine us in London?

                                     RICK
                         When you get there, ask me.

                                     RENAULT
                         Ho, diplomatist!

                                     STRASSER
                         How about New York?

                                     RICK
                         Well, there are certain sections of 
                         New York, Major, that I wouldn't 
                         advise you to try to invade.

                                     STRASSER
                         Aha. Who do you think will win the 
                         war?

                                     RICK
                         I haven't the slightest idea.

                                     RENAULT
                         Rick is completely neutral about 
                         everything. And that takes in the 
                         field of women, too.

                                     STRASSER
                         You weren't always so carefully 
                         neutral. We have a complete dossier 
                         on you.

               Strasser takes a little black book from his pocket and turns 
               to a certain page.

                                     STRASSER
                         "Richard Blaine, American. Age, thirty-
                         seven. Cannot return to his country."

               Strasser looks up from the book

                                     STRASSER
                         The reason is a little vague. We 
                         also know what you did in Paris, Mr. 
                         Blaine, and also we know why you 
                         left Paris.

               Rick reaches over and takes the book from Strasser's hand.

                                     STRASSER
                         Don't worry. We are not going to 
                         broadcast it.

               Rick looks up from the book.

                                     RICK
                         Are my eyes really brown?

                                     STRASSER
                         You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. 
                         Blaine. The point is, an enemy of 
                         the Reich has come to Casablanca and 
                         we are checking up on anybody who 
                         can be of any help to us.

                                     RICK
                         (glances toward Renault)
                         My interest in whether Victor Laszlo 
                         stays or goes is purely a sporting 
                         one.

                                     STRASSER
                         In this case, you have no sympathy 
                         for the fox, huh?

                                     RICK
                         Not particularly. I understand the 
                         point of view of the hound, too.

                                     STRASSER
                         Victor Laszlo published the foulest 
                         lies in the Prague newspapers until 
                         the very day we marched in, and even 
                         after that he continued to print 
                         scandal sheets in a cellar.

                                     RENAULT
                         Of course, one must admit he has 
                         great courage.

                                     STRASSER
                         I admit he is very clever. Three 
                         times he slipped through our fingers. 
                         In Paris he continued his activities. 
                         We intend not to let it happen again.

               Rick gets up.

                                     RICK
                         You'll excuse me, gentlemen. Your 
                         business is politics. Mine is running 
                         a saloon.

                                     STRASSER
                         Good evening, Mr. Blaine.

               Rick walks away toward the gambling room.

                                     RENAULT
                         You see, Major, you have nothing to 
                         worry about Rick.

                                     STRASSER
                         Perhaps.

               A couple comes in the front door. They are VICTOR LASZLO, 
               the Czech resistance leader, and a very pretty young woman 
               wearing a simple white gown, MISS ILSA LUND. She is so 
               beautiful, in fact, that people turn to stare.

               The HEADWAITER comes up to them.

                                     HEADWAITER
                         Yes, Monsieur?

                                     LASZLO
                         I reserved a table. Victor Laszlo.

                                     HEADWAITER
                         Yes, Monsieur Laszlo. Right this 
                         way.

               As the headwaiter takes them to a table they pass by the 
               piano, and the woman looks at Sam.

               Sam, with a conscious effort, keeps his eyes on the keyboard 
               as they go past. He appears to know this woman. After she 
               has gone by Sam steals a look in her direction.

               BERGER, a slight, middle-aged man, observes the couple from 
               a distance.

               The headwaiter seats Ilsa. Laszlo takes the chair opposite 
               and surveys the room.

               Strasser and Renault look up at them from their table.

                                     LASZLO
                         Two cointreaux, please.

                                     WAITER
                         Yes, Monsieur.

                                     LASZLO
                         (to Ilsa)
                         I saw no one of Ugarte's description.

                                     ILSA
                         Victor, I, I feel somehow we shouldn't 
                         stay here.

                                     LASZLO
                         If we would walk out so soon, it 
                         would only call attention to us. 
                         Perhaps Ugarte's in some other part 
                         of the cafe.

               Berger walks up to their table.

                                     BERGER
                         Excuse me, but you look like a couple 
                         who are on their way to America.

                                     LASZLO
                         Well?

               Berger takes a ring from his finger.

                                     BERGER
                         You will find a market there for 
                         this ring. I am forced to sell it at 
                         a great sacrifice.

                                     LASZLO
                         Thank you, but I hardly think --

                                     BERGER
                         -- Then perhaps for the lady. The 
                         ring is quite unique.

               He holds it down for their view. Carefully lifting up the 
               stone, he reveals...

               INSERT - a gold plate in the setting underneath, an impression 
               of the Lorraine Cross of General de Gaulle.

                                     LASZLO
                         Oh, yes, I'm very interested.

               Berger sits down with them.

                                     BERGER
                         Good.

                                     LASZLO
                         (lower voice)
                         What is your name?

                                     BERGER
                         Berger, Norwegian, and at your 
                         service, sir.

               Renault approaches the table from behind Laszlo. Ilsa tries 
               to warn him.

                                     ILSA
                         Victor...

               Laszlo understands.

                                     LASZLO
                         (in a low voice)
                         I'll meet you in a few minutes at 
                         the bar.
                         (in a louder voice)
                         I do not think we want to buy the 
                         ring. But thank you for showing it 
                         to us.

               Berger, taking the cue, sighs and puts the ring away.

                                     BERGER
                         Such a bargain. But that is your 
                         decision?

                                     LASZLO
                         I'm sorry. It is.

               Berger gets up and leaves as Renault moves to the table.

                                     RENAULT
                         Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?

                                     LASZLO
                         Yes.

                                     RENAULT
                         I am Captain Renault, Prefect of 
                         Police.

                                     LASZLO
                         Yes. What is it you want?

                                     RENAULT
                         (amiably)
                         Merely to welcome you to Casablanca 
                         and wish you a pleasant stay. It is 
                         not often we have so distinguished a 
                         visitor.

                                     LASZLO
                         Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, 
                         Captain, but the present French 
                         administration has not always been 
                         so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa 
                         Lund?

                                     RENAULT
                         I was informed you were the most 
                         beautiful woman ever to visit 
                         Casablanca. That was a gross 
                         understatement.

               Ilsa's manner is friendly and reserved, her voice low and 
               soft.

                                     ILSA
                         You are very kind.

                                     LASZLO
                         Won't you join us?

               He sits down.

                                     RENAULT
                         If you will permit me.
                         (calls to the waiter)
                         Oh, Emil. Please, a bottle of your 
                         best champagne, and put it on my 
                         bill.

                                     EMIL
                         Very well, sir.

                                     LASZLO
                         No, Captain, please.

                                     RENAULT
                         No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little 
                         game we play. They put it on the 
                         bill, I tear the bill up. It is very 
                         convenient.

               Ilsa glances off in Sam's direction.

                                     ILSA
                         Captain, the boy who is playing the 
                         piano, somewhere I have seen him.

                                     RENAULT
                         Sam?

                                     ILSA
                         Yes.

                                     RENAULT
                         He came from Paris with Rick.

                                     ILSA
                         Rick? Who's he?

                                     RENAULT
                         (smiling)
                         Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and 
                         Rick is --

                                     ILSA
                         -- Is what?

                                     RENAULT
                         Well, Mademoiselle, he's the kind of 
                         a man that, well, if I were a woman 
                         and I...
                         (taps his chest)
                         were not around, I should be in love 
                         with Rick. But what a fool I am 
                         talking to a beautiful woman about 
                         another man.

               Renault jumps to his feet as Strasser enters.

                                     RENAULT
                         Excuse me. Ah, Major. Mademoiselle 
                         Lund, Monsieur Laszlo, may I present 
                         Major Heinrich Strasser.

               Strasser bows and smiles pleasantly.

                                     STRASSER
                         How do you do. This is a pleasure I 
                         have long looked forward to.

               There is not the slightest recognition from either Ilsa or 
               Laszlo.

               Strasser waits to be asked to seat himself.

                                     LASZLO
                         I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am 
                         not gracious, but you see, Major 
                         Strasser, I'm a Czechoslovakian.

                                     STRASSER
                         You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you 
                         are a subject of the German Reich!

               Laszlo stands.

                                     LASZLO
                         I've never accepted that privilege, 
                         and I'm now on French soil.

                                     STRASSER
                         I should like to discuss some matters 
                         arising from your presence on French 
                         soil.

                                     LASZLO
                         This is hardly the time or the place.

                                     STRASSER
                         (hardening)
                         Then we shall state another time and 
                         another place. Tomorrow at ten in 
                         the Prefect's office, with 
                         Mademoiselle.

                                     LASZLO
                         Captain Renault, I am under your 
                         authority. Is it your order that we 
                         come to your office?

                                     RENAULT
                         (amiably)
                         Let us say that it is my request. 
                         That is a much more pleasant word.

                                     LASZLO
                         Very well.

               Renault and Strasser bow shortly.

                                     RENAULT
                         Mademoiselle.

                                     STRASSER
                         Mademoiselle.

               Renault and Strasser walk away.

                                     RENAULT
                         A very clever tactical retreat, Major.

               Strasser looks at Renault sharply, but sees only a 
               noncommittal smile on Renault's face.

               Laszlo remains standing at the table as Strasser and Renault 
               leave.

                                     LASZLO
                         This time they really mean to stop 
                         me.

                                     ILSA
                         Victor, I'm afraid for you.

                                     LASZLO
                         We have been in difficult places 
                         before, haven't we?

               Ilsa smiles back at him, but her eyes are still troubled.

               On the floor, CORINA strums a guitar and begins her number.

               Meanwhile, Laszlo looks about with apparent casualness. He 
               sees Strasser and Renault whispering together, then notices 
               Berger at the bar.

                                     LASZLO
                         I must find out what Berger knows.

                                     ILSA
                         Be careful.

                                     LASZLO
                         I will, don't worry.

               He rises and goes off.

               We see Ilsa's troubled profile.

               While Corina sings, Sam gives a worried glance in Ilsa's 
               direction. Ilsa watches him.

               At the bar, Berger sips a drink. Laszlo walks up and casually 
               takes a place at the bar next to Berger.

                                     LASZLO
                         Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it 
                         again?

                                     BERGER
                         Yes, Monsieur.

                                     LASZLO
                         (to Sacha)
                         A champagne cocktail, please.

               Laszlo takes the ring and looks at it.

                                     BERGER
                         (in a low voice)
                         I recognize you from the news 
                         photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.

                                     LASZLO
                         In a concentration camp, one is apt 
                         to lose a little weight.

                                     BERGER
                         We read five times that you were 
                         killed in five different places.

                                     LASZLO
                         (smiles wryly)
                         As you see, it was true every single 
                         time. Thank heaven I found you, 
                         Berger. I am looking for a man by 
                         the name of Ugarte. He is supposed 
                         to help me.

               Berger shakes his head.

                                     BERGER
                         Ugarte cannot even help himself, 
                         Monsieur. He is under arrest for 
                         murder. He was arrested here tonight.

               Laszlo absorbs the shock quietly.

                                     LASZLO
                         I see.

                                     BERGER
                         (with intense devotion)
                         But we who are still free will do 
                         all we can. We are organized, 
                         Monsieur, underground like everywhere 
                         else. Tomorrow night there is a 
                         meeting at the Caverne du Bois. If 
                         you would come...

               He stops when Sacha brings the drink to Laszlo.

               Corina finishes her song, and the crowd applauds quite 
               enthusiastically.

               Ilsa sits alone at her table.

                                     ILSA
                         (to waiter)
                         Will you ask the piano player to 
                         come over here, please?

                                     WAITER
                         Very well, Mademoiselle.

               Renault comes up to the bar near Berger and Laszlo.

                                     RENAULT
                         How's the jewelry business, Berger?

                                     BERGER
                         Er, not so good.
                         (to Sacha)
                         May I have my check, please?

                                     RENAULT
                         Too bad you weren't here earlier, 
                         Monsieur Laszlo. We had quite a bit 
                         of excitement this evening, didn't 
                         we, Berger?

                                     BERGER
                         Er, yes. Excuse me, gentlemen.

                                     LASZLO
                         My bill.

                                     RENAULT
                         No. Two champagne cocktails, please.

                                     SACHA
                         Yes, sir.

               Sam wheels in the piano to Ilsa's table. On his face is that 
               funny fear.

               Ilsa herself is not as self-possessed as she tries to appear. 
               There is something behind this, some mystery.

                                     ILSA
                         Hello, Sam.

                         Hello, Miss Ilsa. I never expected 
                         to see you again.

               He sits down and is ready to play.

                         It's been a long time.

                         Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the

                         Yes, ma'am.

               Sam begins to play a number. He is nervous, waiting for 
               anything.

                         night.

               Sam looks very uncomfortable.

                         Uh, he went home.

                         (desperately)
                         he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot.

                         Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're 
                         bad luck to him.

                         Oh I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. 
                         I'm a little rusty on it.

               Of course he can. He doesn't want to play it. He seems even 
               more scared now.

               Ilsa starts to hum.

               Sam begins to play it very softly.

                         Sing it, Sam.

               And Sam sings.

                         You must remember this, A kiss is 
                         just a kiss, A sigh is just a sigh, 
                         The fundamental things apply, As 
                         time goes by.

               The door to the gambling room opens. Rick comes swinging 
               out. He's heard the music and he's livid.

                                     SAM
                         And when two lovers woo, They both 
                         say I love you, On that you can rely, 
                         No matter what the future brings, As 
                         time goes by.

               Rick walks briskly up to the piano.

                                     RICK
                         Sam, I thought I told you never to 
                         play...

               As he sees Ilsa he stops short. Sam stops playing.

               Two close-ups reveal Ilsa and Rick seeing each other.

               Rick appears shocked. For a long moment he just looks at 
               her.

               Sam prepares to move the piano away.

               Renault and Laszlo approach the table from the bar.

                                     RENAULT
                         (laughing)
                         Oh, no, Rick never --

                                     RICK
                         -- Thanks. I will.

               Rick sits down.

                                     RENAULT
                         Well! A precedent is being broken. 
                         Er, Emil!

                                     LASZLO
                         This is a very interesting cafe. I 
                         congratulate you.

                                     RICK
                         And I congratulate you.

                                     LASZLO
                         What for?

                                     RICK
                         Your work.

                                     LASZLO
                         Thank you. I try.

                                     RICK
                         We all try. You succeed.

                                     RENAULT
                         I can't get over you two. She was 
                         asking about you earlier, Rick, in a 
                         way that made me extremely jealous.

                                     ILSA
                         (to Rick)
                         I wasn't sure you were the same. 
                         Let's see, the last time we met --

                                     RICK
                         -- It was "La Belle Aurore."

                                     ILSA
                         How nice. You remembered. But of 
                         course, that was the day the Germans 
                         marched into Paris.

                                     RICK
                         Not an easy day to forget.

                                     ILSA
                         No.

                                     RICK
                         I remember every detail. The Germans 
                         wore gray, you wore blue.

                                     ILSA
                         Yes. I put that dress away. When the 
                         Germans march out, I'll wear it again.

                                     RENAULT
                         Ricky, you're becoming quite human. 
                         I suppose we have to thank you for 
                         that, Mademoiselle.

                                     LASZLO
                         Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to 
                         say it, but it's late.

                                     RENAULT
                         (glancing at his 
                         wristwatch)
                         So it is. And we have a curfew here 
                         in Casablanca. It would never do for 
                         the Chief of Police to be found 
                         drinking after hours and have to 
                         fine himself.

               Rick and Ilsa look at each other.

               Laszlo signals the waiter.

                                     LASZLO
                         I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.

                                     RICK
                         Not at all.

                                     WAITER
                         (to Laszlo)
                         Your check, sir.

               Rick takes the check.

                                     RICK
                         (to waiter)
                         Oh, it's my party.

                                     RENAULT
                         Another precedent gone. This has 
                         been a very interesting evening. 
                         I'll call you a cab. Gasoline 
                         rationing, time of night.

               Renault leaves.

                                     LASZLO
                         We'll come again.

                                     RICK
                         Any time.

                         Say goodnight to Sam for me.

                                     RICK
                         I will.

                                     ILSA
                         There's still nobody in the world 
                         who can play "As Time Goes By" like 
                         Sam.

                                     RICK
                         He hasn't played it in a long time.

               Ilsa smiles.

                                     ILSA
                         Goodnight.

                                     LASZLO
                         Goodnight.

                                     RICK
                         Goodnight.

               Rick and Laszlo nod goodnight to each other. Laszlo and Ilsa 
               start to the door as Rick sits down again and stares off in 
               their direction.

               CUT TO:

               EXT. RICK'S CAFE - NIGHT

               Ilsa and Laszlo leave the cafe.

                                     LASZLO
                         A very puzzling fellow, this Rick. 
                         What sort is he?

               Ilsa doesn't look at him.

                                     ILSA
                         Oh, I really can't say, though I saw 
                         him quite often in Paris.

               They join Renault at the curb.

                                     RENAULT
                         Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's 
                         office.

                                     LASZLO
                         We'll be there.

                                     RENAULT
                         Goodnight.

                                     ILSA
                         Goodnight.

                         Goodnight.

               They get into a waiting cab, leaving Renault on the curb, 
               smoking and looking bemused.

               The neon sign goes off and the doorway is now illuminated by 
               the revolving beacon from the airport.

               CUT TO:

               INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

               The customers have all gone. The house lights are out.

               Rick sits alone at a table. There is a glass of bourbon on 
               the table directly in front of him, and another empty glass 
               on the table before an empty chair. Near at hand is a bottle.

               He fills his glass and drinks it quickly.

               Rick just sits. His face is entirely expressionless. The 
               beacon light from the airport sweeps around the room creating 
               a mood of unreality.

               Sam comes in and stands hesitantly beside Rick.

                                     SAM
                         Boss.

               No answer, as Rick drinks.

                                     SAM
                         Boss!

                                     RICK
                         Yeah?

                                     SAM
                         Boss, ain't you going to bed?

                                     RICK
                         Not right now.

               Sam now realizes Rick is in a very grim mood.

                                     SAM
                         (lightly)
                         Ain't you planning on going to bed 
                         in the near future?

                                     RICK
                         No.

                                     SAM
                         You ever going to bed?

                                     RICK
                         No.

                                     SAM
                         Well, I ain't sleepy either.

                                     RICK
                         Good. Then have a drink.

                                     SAM
                         No. Not me, boss.

                                     RICK
                         Then don't have a drink.

                                     SAM
                         Boss, let's get out of here.

                                     RICK
                         (emphatically)
                         No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.

                                     SAM
                         (earnestly)
                         Please, boss, let's go. Ain't nothing 
                         but trouble for you here.

                                     RICK
                         She's coming back. I know she's coming 
                         back.

                                     SAM
                         We'll take the car and drive all 
                         night. We'll get drunk. We'll go 
                         fishing and stay away until she's 
                         gone.

                                     RICK
                         Shut up and go home, will you?

                                     SAM
                         (stubbornly)
                         No, sir. I'm staying right here.

               Sam sits down at the piano and starts to play softly, 
               improvising.

                                     RICK
                         They grab Ugarte and she walks in. 
                         Well, that's the way it goes. One 
                         in, one out. Sam?

                                     SAM
                         Yeah, boss?

                                     RICK
                         Sam, if it's December 1941 in 
                         Casablanca, what time is it in New 
                         York?

                                     SAM
                         Uh, my watch stopped.

                                     RICK
                         I bet they're asleep in New York. 
                         I'll bet they're asleep all over 
                         America.

               Suddenly he pounds the table and buries his head in his arms. 
               Then he raises his head, trying to regain control.

                                     RICK
                         Of all the gin joints in all the 
                         towns in all the world, she walks 
                         into mine.

               He holds his head in his hands.

                                     RICK
                         What's that you're playing?

                                     SAM
                         Just a little something of my own.

                                     RICK
                         Well, stop it. You know what I want 
                         to hear.

                                     SAM
                         No, I don't.

                                     RICK
                         You played it for her and you can 
                         play it for me.

                                     SAM
                         Well, I don't think I can remember 
                         it.

                                     RICK
                         If she can stand it, I can. Play it!

                                     SAM
                         Yes, boss.

               Sam starts to play "As Time Goes By."

               Rick just stares ahead as orchestra MUSIC slowly joins Sam's

               A) The Arc de Triomphe from a distance.

               B) Rick drives a small, open car slowly along the boulevard.

               He puts his arm around Ilsa. The background scenery changes 
               to a country road as she snuggles close to him and puts her 
               head on his shoulder.

               C) An excursion boat on the Seine. Rick and Ilsa stand at 
               the rail of the boat. They seem to be transported by each 
               other as Ilsa laughs.

               A man sells newspapers to people crowded around him. There 
               is much excitement. Rick and Ilsa sit at a table. They buy a 
               newspaper and begin to read it.

               Nearby, a group of frightened French people cluster around a 
               loudspeaker on a wagon. A harsh voice barks out the tragic 
               news of the Nazi push toward Paris.

               INT. LA BELLE AURORE - AFTERNOON

               A small cafe in the Montmartre. A shadow on the floor reflects 
               the cafe sign "La Belle Aurore."

               Rick, at the bar, gets glasses and a bottle of champagne.

               He walks over to Ilsa and Sam at the piano.

               Sam plays "As Time Goes By."

               Ilsa seems unnerved. There is evidently something on her 
               mind.

               Rick pours the champagne. His manner is wry, but not the 
               bitter wryness we have seen in Casablanca.

                                     RICK
                         Henri wants us to finish this bottle 
                         and then three more. He says he'll 
                         water his garden with champagne before 
                         he'll let the Germans drink any of 
                         it.

               Sam looks at his glass.

               Suddenly a loudspeaker BLARES out something in German. Rick 
               and Ilsa look at each other, then hurry to the window.

                         ...Yes. I was having a brace put on

               Ilsa looks at him tenderly. Rick takes her in his arms, and 
               kisses her hungrily. While they are locked in an embrace 
               they hear the dull BOOM of cannons.

                         thirty-five miles away.

               Another BOOM from the cannons.

                         The Germans'll be here pretty soon 
                         now, and they'll come looking for 
                         you. And don't forget there's a price 
                         on your head.

               It's raining very hard at the train station.

               There is a hectic, fevered excitement, evident in the faces 
               of the people that pass by. This is the last train from Paris.

               Rick appears in the crowd. He stops and puts his suitcase 
               down and glances at his watch.

               A conductor calls out "All aboard, last train leaving in 
               three minutes."

               Rain pours over his head and shoulders, but he doesn't seem 
               to notice. He nervously checks his watch again.

               you left.

               Sam pulls an envelope from his pocket. Rick grabs it, opens 
               it, and stares down at the letter.

               INSERT LETTER

               Richard, I cannot go with you or ever see you again. You

                         That's the last call, Mr. Richard, 
                         do you hear me? Come on, Mr. Richard. 
                         Let's get out of here. Come on, Mr. 
                         Richard, come on.

               Sam pulls a stunned, reluctant Rick to the train. The train 
               starts to move just as he boards.

               From the steps he looks off into the distance, then crumbles 
               the letter and tosses it away as the steam from the engine 
               clouds over him.

               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

               Close-up of a glass on the table in the cafe. Rick's hand 
               reaches for it and knocks it over. We now see Rick's face 
               and he's very drunk.

               Sam walks over to the table to pick up the glass and a fallen 
               chair.

               Just then the door opens and it's Ilsa. Rick stares at the 
               doorway. Ilsa lingers a moment, then comes over to the table.

                                     ILSA
                         Rick, I have to talk to you.

               Her manner is a little uncertain, a little tentative, but 
               with a quiet determination beneath it.

                                     RICK
                         Oh. I saved my first drink to have 
                         with you. Here.

                                     ILSA
                         No. No, Rick. Not tonight.

                                     RICK
                         Especially tonight.

               She sits down in the chair before the empty glass. Her eyes 
               are searching his face, but there is no expression on it 
               except a cold and impassive one.

               Rick reaches for the bottle, and pours himself another drink.

                                     ILSA
                         Please.

                         Why did you have to come to 
                         Casablanca? There are other places.

                         I wouldn't have come if I had known 
                         that you were here. Believe me, Rick, 
                         it's true. I didn't know.

                                     RICK
                         It's funny about your voice, how it 
                         hasn't changed. I can still hear it. 
                         "Richard dear, I'll go with you any 
                         place. We'll get on a train together 
                         and never stop."

                         Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can 
                         understand how you feel.

                                     RICK
                         Huh! You understand how I feel. How 
                         long was it we had, honey?

                         Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly 
                         I remember the last one. A wow finish. 
                         A guy standing on a station platform 
                         in the rain with a comical look on 
                         his face, because his insides had 
                         been kicked out.

               He takes a drink.

                         Has it got a wow finish?

                         I don't know the finish yet.

                         Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will 
                         come to you as you go along.

                                     ILSA
                         It's about a girl who had just come 
                         to Paris from her home in Oslo. At 
                         the house of some friends she met a 
                         man about whom she'd heard her whole 
                         life, a very great and courageous 
                         man. He opened up for her a whole 
                         beautiful world full of knowledge 
                         and thoughts and ideals. Everything 
                         she knew or ever became was because 
                         of him. And she looked up to him and 
                         worshipped him with a feeling she 
                         supposed was love.

                                     RICK
                         Yes, that's very pretty. I heard a 
                         story once. As a matter of fact, 
                         I've heard a lot of stories in my 
                         time. They went along with the sound 
                         of a tinny piano playing in the parlor 
                         downstairs, "Mister, I met a man 
                         once when I was a kid," it'd always 
                         begin. Huh. I guess neither one of 
                         our stories was very funny. Tell me, 
                         who was it you left me for? Was it 
                         Laszlo, or were there others in 
                         between? Or aren't you the kind that 
                         tells?

               Ilsa gets up and leaves.

               Rick's head slumps over the table.

               A sign on the door reads: Captain Renault, Prefect de Police.

               Strasser sits while Renault attends to some paperwork.

                                     STRASSER
                         I strongly suspect that Ugarte left 
                         the letters of transit with Mr. 
                         Blaine. I would suggest you search 
                         the cafe immediately and thoroughly.

                                     RENAULT
                         If Rick has the letters, he's much 
                         too smart to let you find them there.

                                     STRASSER
                         You give him credit for too much 
                         cleverness. My impression was that 
                         he's just another blundering American.

                                     RENAULT
                         But we mustn't underestimate American 
                         blundering. I was with them when 
                         they "blundered" into Berlin in 1918.

               Strasser looks at him.

                                     STRASSER
                         As to Laszlo, we want him watched 
                         twenty-four hours a day.

                         (reassuringly)
                         It may interest you to know that at 
                         this very moment he is on his way

               Renault bows to them both.

                                     RENAULT
                         I am delighted to see you both. Did 
                         you have a good night's rest?

                                     LASZLO
                         I slept very well.

                                     RENAULT
                         That's strange. Nobody is supposed 
                         to sleep well in Casablanca.

                                     LASZLO

                         Thank you.

                         (now as cold as Laszlo)
                         Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not 
                         mince words. You are an escaped 
                         prisoner of the Reich. So far you 
                         have been fortunate enough in eluding 
                         us. You have reached Casablanca. It 
                         is my duty to see that you stay in 
                         Casablanca.

                                     LASZLO
                         Whether or not you succeed is, of 
                         course, problematical.

                                     STRASSER
                         Not at all. Captain Renault's 
                         signature is necessary on every exit 
                         visa.
                         (turns to Renault)
                         Captain, would you think it is 
                         possible that Herr Laszlo will receive 
                         a visa?

                                     RENAULT
                         I am afraid not. My regrets, Monsieur.

                         Well, perhaps I shall like it in 
                         Casablanca.

                         Is that all you wish to tell us?

                                     STRASSER
                         Don't be in such a hurry. You have 
                         all the time in the world. You may 
                         be in Casablanca indefinitely... or 
                         you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow,

                         You know the leaders of the

                         Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam,

                         Even in Berlin.

                         Yes, even in Berlin. If you will 
                         furnish me with their names and their 
                         exact whereabouts, you will have 
                         your visa in the morning.

                         And the honor of having served the

                                     LASZLO
                         I was in a German concentration camp 
                         for a year. That's honor enough for 
                         a lifetime.

                                     STRASSER
                         You will give us the names?

                                     LASZLO
                         If I didn't give them to you in a 
                         concentration camp where you had 
                         more "persuasive methods" at your 
                         disposal, I certainly won't give 
                         them to you now.

               The passionate conviction in his voice now reveals the 
               crusader.

                         And what if you track down these men 
                         and kill them? What if you murdered 
                         all of us? From every corner of 
                         Europe, hundreds, thousands, would 
                         rise to take our places. Even Nazis 
                         can't kill that fast.

                                     STRASSER
                         Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation 
                         for eloquence which I can now 
                         understand. But in one respect you 
                         are mistaken. You said the enemies 
                         of the Reich could all be replaced, 
                         but there is one exception. No one 
                         could take your place in the event 
                         anything unfortunate should occur to 
                         you while you were trying to escape.

                                     LASZLO
                         You won't dare to interfere with me 
                         here. This is still unoccupied France. 
                         Any violation of neutrality would 
                         reflect on Captain Renault.

                                     RENAULT
                         Monsieur, insofar as it is in my 
                         power --

                                     LASZLO
                         -- Thank you.

                                     RENAULT
                         By the way, Monsieur, last night you 
                         evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.

                                     LASZLO
                         Yes.

                                     RENAULT
                         I believe you have a message for 
                         him?

                                     LASZLO
                         Nothing important, but may I speak 
                         to him now?

                                     STRASSER
                         You would find the conversation a 
                         trifle one-sided. Signor Ugarte is 
                         dead.

               Close-ups of Ilsa, then Laszlo, reveal their disappointment.

               Strasser observes their reaction.

                                     ILSA
                         (softly)
                         Oh.

               Renault holds a report.

                                     RENAULT
                         I am making out the report now. We 
                         haven't quite decided whether he 
                         committed suicide or died trying to 
                         escape.

                                     LASZLO
                         Are you quite finished with us?

                                     STRASSER
                         For the time being.

                                     LASZLO
                         Good day.

               Renault rings a buzzer and the door is opened for them.

               As Ilsa and Laszlo leave, an OFFICER comes in.

                                     RENAULT
                         Undoubtedly their next step will be 
                         to the black market.

                                     OFFICER
                         Excuse me, Captain. Another visa 
                         problem has come up.

                                     RENAULT
                         Show her in.

                                     OFFICER
                         Yes, sir.

               Renault looks at himself in the mirror and straightens his 
               tie.

               EXT. BLACK MARKET - DAY

               The black market is a cluttered Arab street of bazaars, shops 
               and stalls. All kinds and races of people mill about the 
               merchandise which native dealers have on outdoor display.

               Both men and women are dressed in tropical clothes. The 
               canopies over the stalls give them some protection from the 
               scorching sun.

               On the surface the atmosphere is merely languid, but 
               underneath lies the sinister workings of illicit trade.

               A FRENCHMAN and a NATIVE huddle together and talk in low 
               tones.

                                     NATIVE
                         I'm sorry, Monsieur, we would have 
                         to handle the police. This is a job 
                         for Signor Ferrari.

                                     FRENCHMAN

                                     NATIVE
                         It can be most helpful to know Signor 
                         Ferrari. He pretty near has a monopoly 
                         on the black market here. You will 
                         find him over there at the Blue 
                         Parrot.

                                     FRENCHMAN

               INT. THE BLUE PARROT - DAY

               The cafe is much less pretentious than Rick's, but well 
               populated.

               Rick enters and walks through the cafe toward Ferrari's office 
               just as Ferrari emerges with Jan and Annina, who look very 
               disappointed.

                                     FERRARI
                         There, don't be too downhearted. 
                         Perhaps you can come to terms with 
                         Captain Renault.

                                     JAN
                         Thank you very much, Signor.

               Jan leads Annina away.

                                     RICK
                         Hello, Ferrari.

               Signor Ferrari turns around. He's pleased to see Rick.

                                     FERRARI
                         Ah, good morning, Rick.

               They shake hands.

                                     RICK
                         I see the bus is in. I'll take my 
                         shipment with me.

                                     FERRARI
                         No hurry. I'll have it sent over. 
                         Have a drink with me.

                                     RICK
                         I never drink in the morning. And 
                         every time you send my shipment over, 
                         it's always just a little bit short.

                                     FERRARI
                         (chuckling)
                         Carrying charges, my boy, carrying 
                         charges. Here, sit down. There's 
                         something I want to talk over with 
                         you, anyhow.

               He hails a waiter.

                                     FERRARI
                         The bourbon.
                         (to Rick, sighing 
                         deeply)
                         The news about Ugarte upset me very 
                         much.

                                     RICK
                         You're a fat hypocrite. You don't 
                         feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I 
                         do.

               He eyes Rick closely.

                                     FERRARI
                         Of course not. What upsets me is the 
                         fact that Ugarte is dead and no one 
                         knows where those letters of transit 
                         are.

                                     RICK
                         Practically no one.

                                     FERRARI
                         If I could lay my hands on those 
                         letters, I could make a fortune.

                                     RICK
                         So could I. And I'm a poor 
                         businessman.

                                     FERRARI
                         I have a proposition for whoever has 
                         those letters. I will handle the 
                         entire transaction, get rid of the 
                         letters, take all the risk, for a 
                         small percentage.

                                     RICK
                         And the carrying charges?

                                     FERRARI
                         Naturally there will be a few 
                         incidental expenses. That is the 
                         proposition I have for whoever has 
                         those letters.

                                     RICK
                         (dryly)
                         I'll tell him when he comes in.

                                     FERRARI
                         Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. 
                         I think you know where those letters 
                         are.

                                     RICK
                         Well, you're in good company. Renault 
                         and Strasser probably think so, too.

               Rick looks out of the window and sees Ilsa at the linen 
               bazaar, then Laszlo walking toward the cafe.

                                     RICK
                         That's why I came over here to give 
                         them a chance to ransack my place.

                                     FERRARI
                         Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into 
                         your confidence. You need a partner.

               Rick isn't listening to him. He looks through the open window 
               in the direction of the linen bazaar.

               Rick gets up.

                                     RICK
                         Excuse me, I'll be getting back.

               Laszlo reaches the entrance to the cafe as Rick comes out.

               He stops and addresses Rick politely.

                                     LASZLO
                         Good morning.

                         Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at 
                         the table.

               As he exits, Laszlo looks after him with a puzzled expression.

               EXT. BLACK MARKET - DAY

               At the linen stall, Ilsa examines a tablecloth which an Arab 
               vendor is endeavoring to sell. He holds a sign which reads 
               "700 francs."

                                     ARAB

                         this in all Morocco, Mademoiselle. 
                         Only seven hundred francs.

               Rick walks up behind Ilsa.

                                     RICK
                         You're being cheated.

               She looks briefly at Rick, then turns away. Her manner is 
               politely formal.

                                     ILSA

                         For friends of Rick we have a small 
                         discount. Did I say seven hundred 
                         francs? You can have it for two 
                         hundred.

               Reaching under the counter, he takes out a sign reading "200 
               francs", and replaces the other sign with it.

                                     RICK
                         I'm sorry I was in no condition to 
                         receive you when you called on me 
                         last night.

                         francs.

               He replaces the second sign with a third which reads "100 
               francs."

               Ilsa pretends to examine the goods on the counter.

                         why you ran out on me at the railway 
                         station?

                         Yes.

                                     RICK
                         Well, you can tell me now. I'm 
                         reasonably sober.

                         I don't think I will, Rick.

                                     RICK
                         Why not? After all, I got stuck with 
                         a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled 
                         to know.

                         Last night I saw what has happened 
                         to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I 
                         could tell him. He'd understand. But 
                         the one who looked at me with such 
                         hatred... well, I'll be leaving 
                         Casablanca soon and we'll never see 
                         each other again. We knew very little 
                         about each other when we were in 
                         love in Paris. If we leave it that 
                         way, maybe we'll remember those days 
                         and not Casablanca, not last night.

                                     RICK
                         Did you run out on me because you 
                         couldn't take it? Because you knew 
                         what it would be like, hiding from 
                         the police, running away all the 
                         time?

                                     RICK
                         Well, I'm not running away any more. 
                         I'm settled now, above a saloon, 
                         it's true, but... walk up a flight. 
                         I'll be expecting you.

               Ilsa turns her head away.

                                     RICK
                         All the same, someday you'll lie to 
                         Laszlo. You'll be there.

                         No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo 
                         is my husband... and was, even when 
                         I knew you in Paris.

               She walks away into the cafe as Rick stares after her in 
               stunned disbelief.

               Ilsa and Laszlo sit with Ferrari.

                         I was just telling Monsieur Laszlo 
                         that, unfortunately, I am not able 
                         to help him.

                         You see, my dear, the word has gone 
                         around.

                         (to Ilsa)
                         As leader of all illegal activities 
                         in Casablanca, I am an influential 
                         and respected man. It would not be 
                         worth my life to do anything for 
                         Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a 
                         different matter.

                                     LASZLO
                         Signor Ferrari thinks it might just 
                         be possible to get an exit visa for 
                         you.

                         I will stay here and keep on trying. 
                         I'm sure in a little while --

                         -- We might as well be frank, 
                         Monsieur. It will take a miracle to 
                         get you out of Casablanca. And the 
                         Germans have outlawed miracles.

                                     LASZLO
                         Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.

                         You two will want to discuss this. 
                         Excuse me. I'll be at the bar.

               Ferrari gets to his feet and walks away.

                                     LASZLO
                         No, Ilsa, I won't let you stay here. 
                         You must get to America. And believe 
                         me, somehow I will get out and join 
                         you.

                         But, Victor, if the situation were 
                         different, if I had to stay and there 
                         were only a visa for one, would you 
                         take it?

                                     LASZLO
                         (not very convincingly)
                         Yes, I would.

               Ilsa smiles faintly. She doesn't believe it for even a moment.

                         Yes, I see. When I had trouble getting 
                         out of Lille, why didn't you leave 
                         me there? And when I was sick in 
                         Marseilles and held you up for two 
                         weeks and you were in danger every 
                         minute of the time, why didn't you 
                         leave me then?

                                     LASZLO
                         I meant to, but something always 
                         held me up. I love you very much, 
                         Ilsa.

               She smiles again.

                         Your secret will be safe with me. 
                         Ferrari is waiting for our answer.

               At the bar Ferrari talks to a waiter.

                                     FERRARI
                         Not more than fifty francs though.

               Ilsa and Laszlo walk up to him.

                                     LASZLO
                         We've decided, Signor Ferrari. For 
                         the present we'll go on looking for 
                         two exit visas. Thank you very much.

                                     FERRARI
                         Well, good luck. But be careful.

                         in the direction of 
                         the bazaar)
                         You know you're being shadowed?

               Laszlo glances in the direction of the bazaar.

                                     LASZLO
                         Of course. It becomes an instinct.

               Ferrari looks shrewdly at Ilsa.

                                     FERRARI
                         I observe that you in one respect 
                         are a very fortunate man, Monsieur. 
                         I am moved to make one more 
                         suggestion, why, I do not know, 
                         because it cannot possibly profit 
                         me, but, have you heard about Signor 
                         Ugarte and the letters of transit?

                                     LASZLO
                         Yes, something.

                                     FERRARI
                         Those letters were not found on Ugarte 
                         when they arrested him.

               There's a moments pause as this sinks in.

                                     LASZLO
                         Do you know where they are?

                                     FERRARI
                         Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will 
                         venture to guess that Ugarte left 
                         those letters with Monsieur Rick.

               Ilsa's face darkens. Laszlo quietly observes.

                                     LASZLO
                         Rick?

                                     FERRARI
                         He is a difficult customer, that 
                         Rick. One never knows what he'll do 
                         or why. But it is worth a chance.

                                     LASZLO
                         Thank you very much. Good day.

                         leave Casablanca.

               Ferrari bows.

                                     FERRARI
                         It was gracious of you to share it 
                         with me. Good day, Mademoiselle,

               As Ilsa and Laszlo leave the cafe, Ferrari nonchalantly swats 
               a fly on a table.

               make sure nothing is missing.

               Sam and Corina play a number, accompanied by the orchestra.

               Strasser and his crowd enter the cafe and pass Rick's table.

                         find the letters here. But I told my 
                         men to be especially destructive. 
                         You know how that impresses Germans?
                         (taking a sip)
                         Rick, have you got these letters of 
                         transit?

                                     RICK
                         Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free 
                         French?

                                     RENAULT
                         Serves me right for asking a direct 
                         question. The subject is closed.

                                     RICK
                         Well, it looks like you're a little 
                         late.

                                     RENAULT
                         Huh?

               Rick gazes at Yvonne and a GERMAN OFFICER approaching the 
               bar.

                                     RICK
                         So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.

                                     RENAULT
                         Who knows? In her own way she may 
                         constitute an entire second front. I 
                         think it's time for me to flatter 
                         Major Strasser a little. I'll see 
                         you later, Rick.

               Renault gets up and strolls away.

               At the bar, Yvonne and the German officer place their orders.

                                     YVONNE
                         Sacha!

                                     GERMAN OFFICER
                         French seventy-fives.

               Yvonne is somewhat drunk already.

                                     YVONNE
                         Put up a whole row of them, Sacha... 
                         starting here and ending here.

               She indicates with her hand where she wants them.

                                     GERMAN OFFICER
                         We will begin with two.

               A FRENCH OFFICER at the bar makes a remark to Yvonne.

                                     FRENCH OFFICER
                         (in French)
                         Say, you, you are not French to go 
                         with a German like this!

                                     YVONNE
                         (in French)
                         What are you butting in for?

                                     FRENCH OFFICER
                         (in French)
                         I am butting in --

                                     YVONNE
                         (breaking in, in French)
                         -- It's none of your business!

                                     GERMAN OFFICER
                         (in French)
                         No, no, no, no! One minute!
                         (in English)
                         What did you say? Would you kindly 
                         repeat it?

                                     FRENCH OFFICER
                         What I said is none of your business!

                                     GERMAN OFFICER
                         I will make it my business!

               They begin to fight.

                                     YVONNE
                         (in French)
                         Stop! I beg of you! I beg of you, 
                         stop!

               There are exclamations from people nearby. German officers 
               at a nearby table rise, ready to join in. Rick walks up and 
               separates the two men.

                                     RICK
                         (to the German)
                         I don't like disturbances in my place. 
                         Either lay off politics or get out.

                                     FRENCH OFFICER
                         (in French)
                         Dirty Boche. Someday we'll have our 
                         revenge!

               Renault, Strasser and the other officers sit down again.

                                     STRASSER
                         You see, Captain, the situation is 
                         not as much under control as you 
                         believe.

                                     RENAULT
                         My dear Major, we are trying to 
                         cooperate with your government, but 
                         we cannot regulate the feelings of 
                         our people.

               Strasser eyes him closely.

                                     STRASSER
                         Captain Renault, are you entirely 
                         certain which side you're on?

                                     RENAULT
                         I have no conviction, if that's what 
                         you mean. I blow with the wind, and 
                         the prevailing wind happens to be 
                         from Vichy.

                                     STRASSER
                         And if it should change?

               He smiles.

                                     RENAULT
                         Surely the Reich doesn't admit that 
                         possibility?

               Renault lights a cigarette and puffs away.

                                     STRASSER
                         We are concerned about more than 
                         Casablanca. We know that every French 
                         province in Africa is honeycombed 
                         with traitors waiting for their 
                         chance, waiting, perhaps, for a 
                         leader.

                                     RENAULT
                         (casually)
                         A leader, like Laszlo?

                                     STRASSER
                         Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is 
                         too dangerous if we let him go. It 
                         may be too dangerous if we let him 
                         stay.

                                     RENAULT
                         (thoughtfully)
                         I see what you mean.

               Carl, bottle in hand, approaches the table of a middle-aged 
               German couple, the LEUCHTAGS.

                                     CARL
                         (in German)
                         I brought you the finest brandy. 
                         Only the employees drink it here.

               He pours a drink for each of them.

                                     MR. LEUCHTAG
                         Thank you, Carl.

                                     CARL
                         (as he pours)
                         For Mrs. Leuchtag.

                                     MRS. LEUCHTAG
                         Thank you, Carl.

                                     CARL
                         For Mr. Leuchtag.

                                     MR. LEUCHTAG
                         Carl, sit down. Have a brandy with 
                         us.

                                     MRS. LEUCHTAG
                         (beaming with happiness)
                         To celebrate our leaving for America 
                         tomorrow.

               Carl sits down.

                                     CARL
                         Thank you very much. I thought you 
                         would ask me, so I brought the good 
                         brandy and a third glass.

               He produces a glass from a back pocket.

                                     MRS. LEUCHTAG
                         At last the day has came.

                                     MR. LEUCHTAG
                         Frau Leuchtag and I are speaking 
                         nothing but English now.

                                     MRS. LEUCHTAG
                         So we should feel at home ven ve get 
                         to America.

                                     CARL
                         A very nice idea.

                                     MR. LEUCHTAG
                         (raising his glass)
                         To America.

               Mrs. Leuchtag and Carl repeat "To America." They clink glasses 
               and drink.

                                     MR. LEUCHTAG
                         Liebchen, uh, sweetness heart, what 
                         watch?

               She glances at her wristwatch.

                                     MRS. LEUCHTAG
                         Ten watch.

                                     MR. LEUCHTAG
                         (surprised)
                         Such much?

                                     CARL
                         Er, you will get along beautifully 
                         in America, huh.

               Annina meets Renault in the hallway as she leaves the Gambling 
               room.

                                     RENAULT
                         How's lady luck treating you? Aw, 
                         too bad. You'll find him over there.

               Annina sees Rick and goes to his table.

                                     ANNINA
                         Monsieur Rick?

                                     RICK
                         Yes?

                                     ANNINA
                         Could I speak to you for just a 
                         moment, please?

               Rick looks at her.

                                     RICK
                         How did you get in here? You're under 
                         age.

                                     ANNINA
                         I came with Captain Renault.

                                     RICK
                         (cynically)
                         I should have known.

                                     ANNINA
                         My husband is with me, too.

                                     RICK
                         He is? Well, Captain Renault's getting 
                         broadminded. Sit down. Will you have 
                         a drink?

               Annina shakes her head.

                                     RICK
                         No, of course not. Do you mind if I 
                         do?

                                     ANNINA
                         No.

               Rick pours himself a drink.

                                     ANNINA
                         Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is 
                         Captain Renault?

                                     RICK
                         Oh, he's just like any other man, 
                         only more so.

                                     ANNINA
                         No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is 
                         his word --

                                     RICK
                         -- Now, just a minute. Who told you 
                         to ask me that?

                                     ANNINA
                         He did. Captain Renault did.

                                     RICK
                         I thought so. Where's your husband?

                                     ANNINA
                         At the roulette table, trying to win 
                         enough for our exit visa. Well of 
                         course, he's losing.

               Rick looks at her closely.

                                     RICK
                         How long have you been married?

                                     ANNINA
                         Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria.
                         Oh, things are very bad there, 
                         Monsieur. A devil has the people by 
                         the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do 
                         not want our children to grow up in 
                         such a country.

                                     RICK
                         (wearily)
                         So you decided to go to America.

                                     ANNINA
                         Yes, but we have not much money, and 
                         traveling is so expensive and 
                         difficult. It was much more than we 
                         thought to get here. And then Captain 
                         Renault sees us and he is so kind. 
                         He wants to help us.

                                     RICK
                         Yes, I'll bet.

                                     ANNINA
                         He tells me he can give us an exit 
                         visa, but we have no money.

                                     RICK
                         Does he know that?

                                     ANNINA
                         Oh, yes.

                                     RICK
                         And he is still willing to give you 
                         a visa?

                                     ANNINA
                         Yes, Monsieur.

                                     RICK
                         And you want to know --

                                     ANNINA
                         -- Will he keep his word?

                                     RICK
                         He always has.

               There is a silence. Annina is very disturbed.

                                     ANNINA
                         Oh, Monsieur, you are a man. If 
                         someone loved you very much, so that 
                         your happiness was the only thing 
                         that she wanted in the whole world, 
                         but she did a bad thing to make 
                         certain of it, could you forgive 
                         her?

               Rick stares off into space.

                                     RICK
                         Nobody ever loved me that much.

                                     ANNINA
                         And he never knew, and the girl kept 
                         this bad thing locked in her heart? 
                         That would be all right, wouldn't 
                         it?

                                     RICK
                         (harshly)
                         You want my advice?

                                     ANNINA
                         Oh, yes, please.

                                     RICK
                         Go back to Bulgaria.

                                     ANNINA
                         Oh, but if you knew what it means to 
                         us to leave Europe, to get to America! 
                         Oh, but if Jan should find out! He 
                         is such a boy. In many ways I am so 
                         much older than he is.

                                     RICK
                         Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca 
                         has problems. Yours may work out. 
                         You'll excuse me.

               Rick abruptly rises.

                                     ANNINA
                         (tonelessly)
                         Thank you, Monsieur.

               He quickly goes off, leaving Annina alone at the table.

               She remains seated, too demoralized to move.

               While Rick checks the reservation list, Ilsa and Laszlo enter 
               the cafe.

               In the background we hear Sam playing, ironically enough, 
               "It Had to Be You."

               Rick greets Ilsa and Laszlo.

                                     RICK
                         Good evening.

                                     LASZLO
                         Good evening. You see, here we are 
                         again.

                                     RICK
                         I take that as a great compliment to 
                         Sam.
                         (to Ilsa)
                         I suppose he means to you Paris of, 
                         well, happier days.

               Laszlo looks around.

                                     ILSA
                         (quietly)
                         He does. Could we have a table close 
                         to him?

                                     LASZLO
                         And as far away from Major Strasser 
                         as possible.

                                     RICK
                         Well, the geography may be a little 
                         difficult to arrange.

               Rick snaps his fingers for the headwaiter.

                                     RICK
                         Paul! Table thirty!

                                     HEADWAITER
                         (to Ilsa and Laszlo)
                         Yes, sir. Right this way, if you 
                         please.

                                     RICK
                         (to Ilsa)
                         I'll have Sam play "As Time Goes 
                         By." I believe that's your favorite 
                         tune.

                                     ILSA
                         (smiling)
                         Thank you.

               Rick walks over to Sam and whispers something to him. Sam 
               stops what he is playing and begins "As Time Goes By."

               He shakes his head as Rick leaves.

               A waiter appears at Ilsa and Laszlo's table.

                                     LASZLO
                         Two cognacs, please.

               CUT TO:

               INT. RICK'S CAFE - GAMBLING ROOM - NIGHT

               Jan sits at the roulette table. He has only three chips left 
               and seems bewildered.

               As Rick comes up the croupier speaks to Jan.

                                     CROUPIER
                         Do you wish to place another bet, 
                         sir?

                                     JAN
                         No, no, I guess not.

               Rick stands behind Jan.

                                     RICK
                         (to Jan)
                         Have you tried twenty-two tonight? I 
                         said, twenty-two.

               Jan looks at Rick, then at the chips in his hand.

               He pauses, then puts the chips on twenty-two.

               Rick and the croupier exchange looks. The croupier understands 
               what Rick wants him to do. He spins the wheel.

               Carl follows the proceedings, fascinated.

               The wheel stops spinning.

                                     CROUPIER
                         (in French)
                         Twenty-two, black, twenty-two.

               A winner. Renault, at a nearby table, takes notice of what 
               is happening.

               The croupier pushes a pile of chips onto twenty-two and Jan 
               reaches for it.

                                     RICK
                         (not even looking at 
                         Jan)
                         Leave it there.

               Jan hesitates, then withdraws his hands.

               Carl continues to watch.

               The wheel spins. Nobody speaks while it spins. It stops.

                                     CROUPIER
                         Twenty-two, black.

               Another winner. The croupier shoves a pile of chips toward 
               Jan.

                                     RICK
                         (to Jan)
                         Cash it in and don't come back.

               Jan rises to go to the cashier.

               A CUSTOMER complains to Carl.

                                     CUSTOMER
                         Say, are you sure this place is 
                         honest?

                                     CARL
                         (fervently)
                         Honest! As honest as the day is long!

               Meanwhile, Rick has walked over to the croupier.

                                     RICK
                         How we doing tonight?

                                     CROUPIER
                         Well, a couple of thousand less than 
                         I thought there would be.

               Rick smiles slightly and goes toward the door.

               Annina runs up to him and hugs him.

                                     ANNINA
                         Monsieur Rick, I --

                                     RICK
                         -- He's just a lucky guy.

                                     CARL
                         (solicitously)
                         Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup 
                         of coffee?

                                     RICK
                         No thanks, Carl.

                                     CARL
                         Monsieur Rick!

               Renault, seeing that Jan has won, gets up from his table to 
               follow Rick. Jan and Annina stop him on the way.

                                     JAN
                         Captain Renault, may I --

                                     RENAULT
                         -- Oh, not here, please. Come to my 
                         office in the morning. We'll do 
                         everything business-like.

                                     JAN
                         We'll be there at six.

                                     RENAULT
                         I'll be there at ten. I am very happy 
                         for both of you. Still, it's very 
                         strange that you won.

               He looks over and sees Rick.

                                     RENAULT
                         Well, maybe not so strange. I'll see 
                         you in the morning.

                                     ANNINA
                         Thank you so much, Captain Renault.

               CUT TO:

               INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

               At the bar, Carl whispers in Sacha's ear. Sacha says "No!" 
               and runs to Rick.

                                     SACHA
                         Boss, you've done a beautiful thing.

               He kisses Rick on both cheeks.

                                     RICK
                         Go away, you crazy Russian!

               Carl pours a brandy for Rick.

               Pretending not to do so, Rick glances in Ilsa's direction.

               Renault comes up to him.

                                     RENAULT
                         As I suspected, you're a rank 
                         sentimentalist.

                                     RICK
                         Yeah? Why?

                                     RENAULT
                         (chidingly)
                         Why do you interfere with my little 
                         romances?

                                     RICK
                         Put it down as a gesture to love.

                                     RENAULT
                         (good-naturedly)
                         Well, I forgive you this time. But 
                         I'll be in tomorrow night with a 
                         breathtaking blonde, and it will 
                         make me very happy if she loses. Uh 
                         huh!

               He smiles and walks away. Laszlo comes up to Rick.

                                     LASZLO
                         Monsieur Blaine, I wonder if I could 
                         talk to you?

                                     RICK
                         Go ahead.

                                     LASZLO
                         Well, isn't there some other place? 
                         It's rather confidential, what I 
                         have to say.

                                     RICK
                         My office.

                                     LASZLO
                         Right.

               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. RICK'S CAFE - OFFICE - NIGHT

               Rick and Laszlo sit and discuss Laszlo's dilemma.

                                     LASZLO
                         You must know it's very important I 
                         get out of Casablanca. It's my 
                         privilege to be one of the leaders 
                         of a great movement. You know what I 
                         have been doing. You know what it 
                         means to the work, to the lives of 
                         thousands and thousands of people 
                         that I be free to reach America and 
                         continue my work.

                                     RICK
                         I'm not interested in politics. The 
                         problems of the world are not in my 
                         department. I'm a saloon keeper.

                                     LASZLO
                         My friends in the underground tell 
                         me that you have quite a record. You 
                         ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought 
                         against the fascists in Spain.

                                     RICK
                         What of it?

                                     LASZLO
                         Isn't it strange that you always 
                         happened to be fighting on the side 
                         of the underdog?

                                     RICK
                         Yes. I found that a very expensive 
                         hobby, too. But then I never was 
                         much of a businessman.

               Rick gets up, as does Laszlo.

                                     LASZLO
                         Are you enough of a businessman to 
                         appreciate an offer of a hundred 
                         thousand francs?

                                     RICK
                         I appreciate it, but I don't accept 
                         it.

                                     LASZLO
                         I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.

                                     RICK
                         My friend, you could make it a million 
                         francs, or three, my answer would 
                         still be the same.

                                     LASZLO
                         There must be some reason why you 
                         won't let me have them.

                                     RICK
                         There is. I suggest that you ask 
                         your wife.

                                     LASZLO
                         I beg your pardon?

                                     RICK
                         I said, ask your wife.

                                     LASZLO
                         My wife?

               Laszlo looks at him, puzzled.

                                     RICK
                         Yes.

               Rick and Laszlo hear MALE VOICES singing downstairs.

               CUT TO:

               INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

               A group of German officers stand around the piano singing 
               the "Wacht am Rhein."

               INT. RICK'S CAFE - BALCONY - NIGHT

               Rick stands at the balcony outside his office and watches 
               the Germans below.

               INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

               At the bar, Renault watches with raised eyebrow.

               INT. RICK'S CAFE - BALCONY - NIGHT

               Laszlo's lips are very tight as he listens to the song.

               He starts down the step.

               CUT TO:

               INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

               Laszlo passes the table where Ilsa sits and goes straight to 
               the orchestra.

               Yvonne, sitting at a table with her German officer, stares 
               down into her drink.

               Laszlo speaks to the orchestra.

                                     LASZLO
                         Play the Marseillaise! Play it!

               Members of the orchestra glance toward the steps, toward 
               Rick, who nods to them.

               Laszlo and Corina sing as they start to play. Strasser 
               conducts the German singing in an attempt to drown out the 
               competition.

               People in the cafe begin to sing the "Marseillaise."

               After a while, Strasser and his officers give up and sit 
               down. The "Marseillaise" continues, however.

               Yvonne jumps up and sings with tears in her eyes.

               Ilsa, overcome with emotion, looks proudly at Laszlo, who 
               sings with passion.

               Finally the whole cafe stands, singing, their faces aglow. 
               The song finishes on a high, triumphant note.

               Yvonne's face is exalted. She deliberately faces the alcove 
               where the Germans are watching. She SHOUTS at the top of her 
               lungs.

                                     YVONNE
                         Vive La France! Vive la democracie!

                                     CROWD
                         Vive La France! Vive la democracie!

               People clap and cheer.

               Strasser is very angry. He strides across the floor toward 
               Renault who is standing at the bar.

                                     STRASSER
                         You see what I mean? If Laszlo's 
                         presence in a cafe can inspire this 
                         unfortunate demonstration, what more 
                         will his presence in Casablanca bring 
                         on? I advise that this place be shut 
                         up at once.

                                     RENAULT
                         (innocently)
                         But everybody's having such a good 
                         time.

                                     STRASSER
                         Yes, much too good a time. The place 
                         is to be closed.

                                     RENAULT
                         But I have no excuse to close it.

                                     STRASSER
                         (snapping)
                         Find one.

               Several French officers surround Laszlo, offering him a drink.

               Renault thinks a moment, then blows a loud BLAST on his 
               whistle. The room grows quiet, all eyes turn toward Renault.

                                     RENAULT
                         (loudly)
                         Everybody is to leave here 
                         immediately! This cafe is closed 
                         until further notice! Clear the room 
                         at once!

               An angry murmur starts among the crowd. People get up and 
               begin to leave.

               Rick comes quickly up to Renault.

                                     RICK
                         How can you close me up? On what 
                         grounds?

                                     RENAULT
                         I am shocked, shocked to find that 
                         gambling is going on in here!

               This display of nerve leaves Rick at a loss. The croupier 
               comes out of the gambling room and up to Renault. He hands 
               him a roll of bills.

                                     CROUPIER
                         Your winnings, sir.

                                     RENAULT
                         Oh. Thank you very much.

               He turns to the crowd again.

                                     RENAULT
                         Everybody out at once!

               As the cafe empties, Strasser approaches Ilsa. His manner is 
               abrupt but cordial.

                                     STRASSER
                         Mademoiselle, after this disturbance 
                         it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in 
                         Casablanca.

                                     STRASSER
                         That is also true, except for one 
                         destination, to return to occupied

                         for him.

                         It is possible the French authorities 
                         will find a reason to put him in the

                         My dear Mademoiselle, perhaps you 
                         have already observed that in 
                         Casablanca, human life is cheap. 
                         Good night, Mademoiselle.

               She looks at him, understanding what he means.

               He bows and exits as Laszlo arrives at the table.

               They start out of the cafe.

               Laszlo switches on the light as they enter. While Ilsa takes 
               off some jewelry he walks to the window and peers out into

               an arch. Laszlo watches him, then draws down the shade.

                         Apparently he has the letters.

                                     ILSA
                         Yes?

                                     LASZLO
                         But no intention of selling them. 
                         One would think if sentiment wouldn't 
                         persuade him, money would.

               Ilsa is now noticeably uncomfortable.

                                     ILSA
                         Did he give any reason?

                                     LASZLO
                         He suggested I ask you.

                                     ILSA
                         Ask me?

                                     LASZLO
                         Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I 
                         don't know why he said that.

               Laszlo turns off the light. Ilsa walks over to the couch and 
               sits down.

                                     LASZLO
                         Well, our friend outside will think 
                         we've retired by now. I'll be going 
                         in a few minutes.

               He sits down on the couch next to her. A silence falls between 
               them. It grows strained. Finally...

                                     LASZLO
                         Ilsa, I --

                                     ILSA
                         -- Yes?

                                     LASZLO
                         When I was in the concentration camp, 
                         were you lonely in Paris?

               Ilsa still cannot look at him.

                                     ILSA
                         Yes, Victor, I was.

                                     LASZLO
                         (sympathetically)
                         I know how it is to be lonely.
                         (very quietly)
                         Is there anything you wish to tell 
                         me?

                                     ILSA
                         (speaking low)
                         No, Victor, there isn't.

                                     LASZLO
                         I love you very much, my dear.

               Ilsa finally turns to look at Laszlo.

                                     ILSA
                         Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I 
                         do, will you believe that I, that --

                                     LASZLO
                         -- You don't even have to say it. 
                         I'll believe. Goodnight, dear.

               He bends down and kisses her cheek.

                                     ILSA
                         Goodnight.

               She watches him go.

                                     ILSA
                         Victor!

               She gets up and follows him to the door. He opens it. In the 
               slit of light from the hall we see Ilsa's face, now strained 
               and worried. She hesitates for a moment, then...

                                     ILSA
                         Be careful.

                                     LASZLO
                         Of course, I'll be careful.

               He kisses her on the cheek and goes out the door. She stands 
               there for a few seconds, then crosses to look out of the 
               window.

               The figure in the archway is gone. She sees Victor walking 
               down the street and closes the blind again. Ilsa gets a cloak 
               from the bedroom, and leaves the hotel room.

               INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

               Rick and Carl sit by the bar and look over ledgers. Carl is 
               busy figuring. He looks up at Rick.

                                     CARL
                         Well, you are in pretty good shape,

                         How long can I afford to stay closed?

                                     CARL
                         Oh, two weeks, maybe three.

                                     RICK
                         Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has 
                         worked before. In the meantime, 
                         everybody stays on salary.

                                     CARL
                         Oh, thank you, Herr Rick. Sacha will 
                         be happy to hear it. I owe him money.

               Carl laughs.

                                     RICK
                         Now you finish locking up, will you, 
                         Carl?

                                     CARL
                         I will. Then I am going to the meeting

                         (interrupting)
                         -- Don't tell me where you're going.

                                     CARL
                         I won't.

                                     RICK
                         Goodnight.

                                     CARL
                         Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.

               Rick walks up the stairs to his apartment.

               CUT TO:

               INT. RICK'S CAFE - APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Rick opens the door and goes inside the dark room. Light 
               from the hall reveals a figure by the window. He lights a 
               small lamp. Ilsa faces him, her face white but determined.

               Rick pauses for a moment in astonishment.

                                     RICK
                         How did you get in?

                         The stairs from the street.

               Ilsa comes over to meet him.

                                     RICK
                         I told you this morning you'd come 
                         around, but this is a little ahead 
                         of schedule. Well, won't you sit 
                         down?

                                     ILSA
                         Richard, I had to see you.

                                     RICK
                         You use "Richard" again? We're back 
                         in Paris.

                         Your unexpected visit isn't connected 
                         by any chance with the letters of 
                         transit? It seems that as long as I 
                         have those letters I'll never be 
                         lonely.

                                     ILSA
                         You can ask any price you want, but 
                         you must give me those letters.

                                     RICK
                         I went through all that with your 
                         husband. It's no deal.

                         I know how you feel about me, but 
                         I'm asking you to put your feelings 
                         aside for something more important.

                                     RICK
                         Do I have to hear again what a great 
                         man your husband is? What an important 
                         cause he's fighting for?

                                     ILSA
                         It was your cause, too. In your own 
                         way, you were fighting for the same 
                         thing.

                                     RICK
                         I'm not fighting for anything anymore, 
                         except myself. I'm the only cause 
                         I'm interested in.

               He walks over to the window and Ilsa follows.

                         now to get what you want.

               Rick walks over to a table and opens a cigarette box, but 
               finds it empty.

                         You want to feel sorry for yourself,

                         all you can think of is your own 
                         feelings. One woman has hurt you,

                         What of it? I'm going to die in 
                         Casablanca. It's a good spot for it.

               He turns away to light a cigarette, then back to Ilsa.

               He stops short as he sees Ilsa holding a small revolver in 
               her hand. It's pointed directly at him.

                         If Laszlo and the cause mean so much

               He moves closer to her.

                         Go ahead and shoot. You'll be doing 
                         me a favor.

               Her hand drops down, and there are tears in her eyes again.

               Rick follows her and takes her in his arms. He presses her 
               tight to him.

               INT. RICK'S CAFE - APARTMENT - LATER

               From his window, Rick watches the revolving beacon light at 
               the airport.

               Ilsa sits on the couch. On a table before her rests a bottle 
               of champagne along with two half-filled glasses.

               Rick walks over to her.

                                     RICK
                         And then?

                                     ILSA
                         It wasn't long after we were married 
                         that Victor went back to 
                         Czechoslovakia. They needed him in 
                         Prague, but there the Gestapo were 
                         waiting for him. Just a two-line 
                         item in the paper: "Victor Laszlo 
                         apprehended. Sent to concentration 
                         camp." I was frantic. For months I 
                         tried to get word. Then it came. He 
                         was dead, shot trying to escape. I 
                         was lonely. I had nothing. Not even 
                         hope. Then I met you.

                                     RICK
                         Why weren't you honest with me? Why 
                         did you keep your marriage a secret?

               Rick sits down with Ilsa.

                                     ILSA
                         Oh, it wasn't my secret, Richard. 
                         Victor wanted it that way. Not even 
                         our closest friends knew about our 
                         marriage. That was his way of 
                         protecting me. I knew so much about 
                         his work, and if the Gestapo found 
                         out I was his wife it would be 
                         dangerous for me and for those working 
                         with me.

                                     RICK
                         When did you first find out he was 
                         alive?

                                     ILSA
                         Just before you and I were to leave 
                         Paris together. A friend came and 
                         told me that Victor was alive. They 
                         were hiding him in a freight car on 
                         the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, 
                         he needed me. I wanted to tell you, 
                         but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew 
                         you wouldn't have left Paris, and 
                         the Gestapo would have caught you. 
                         So I... well, well, you know the 
                         rest.

                                     RICK
                         Huh. But it's still a story without 
                         an ending. What about now?

                                     ILSA
                         Now? I don't know. I know that I'll 
                         never have the strength to leave you 
                         again.

                                     RICK
                         And Laszlo?

                                     ILSA
                         Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, 
                         won't you? You'll see that he gets 
                         out? Then he'll have his work, all 
                         that he's been living for.

                                     RICK
                         All except one. He won't have you.

               Ilsa puts her head on Rick's shoulder.

                                     ILSA
                         I can't fight it anymore. I ran away 
                         from you once. I can't do it again. 
                         Oh, I don't know what's right any 
                         longer. You'll have to think for 
                         both of us, for all of us.

                                     RICK
                         All right, I will. Here's looking at 
                         you, kid.

               She snuggles closer to Rick.

               Laszlo and Carl make their way through the darkness toward a 
               side entrance of Rick's. They run inside the entryway.

               The headlights of a speeding police car sweep toward them.

               They flatten themselves against a wall to avoid detection.

               The lights move past them.

                                     CARL
                         I think we lost them.

                                     LASZLO
                         Yes. I'm afraid they caught some of 
                         the others.

                                     CARL

               Carl goes behind the bar.

                                     CARL

               Rick and Ilsa hear voices below. Rick crosses to the door.

               He opens it just enough to see below, and turns off the light.

               Ilsa stands just in back of him. She makes a move as if to 
               go out to the balcony but Rick's pushes her back. She 
               withdraws behind the door.

               Rick walks out to the balcony railing.

               INT. RICK'S CAFE - BALCONY/MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

               Rick sees Carl attending to Laszlo, who appears to be injured.

                         Carl, what happened?

               Both Carl and Laszlo look up.

                                     CARL
                         (excitedly)
                         The police break up our meeting. 
                         Herr Rick! We escaped in the last 
                         moment.

                         Come up here a minute.

               Carl looks up wonderingly, then starts toward the stairway.

                                     CARL
                         Yes, I come.

                         I want you to turn out the light in 
                         the rear entrance. It might attract 
                         the police.

                                     CARL

                         Yes, I come, I will do it.

                                     RICK
                         (in a low voice)
                         I want you to take Miss Lund home.

                                     CARL

               INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

               Rick comes down the stairs. Laszlo wraps one of the small 
               bar towels around his cut wrist. Rick looks questioningly at 
               the injured hand.

                                     LASZLO
                         It's nothing. Just a little cut. We 
                         had to get through a window.

               Rick walks to the bar, picks up a bottle, and pours a drink.

                                     RICK
                         Well, this might come in handy.

                                     LASZLO
                         Thank you.

                         Had a close one, eh?

                                     LASZLO
                         Yes, rather.

               Laszlo takes a drink.

                                     RICK
                         Don't you sometimes wonder if it's 
                         worth all this? I mean what you're 
                         fighting for?

                                     LASZLO
                         We might as well question why we 
                         breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll 
                         die. If we stop fighting our enemies, 
                         the world will die.

                                     RICK
                         What of it? Then it'll be out of 
                         it's misery.

               Rick reaches in his jacket for his cigarette case, opens it, 
               and takes out a cigarette.

                                     LASZLO
                         You know how you sound, Monsieur 
                         Blaine? Like a man who's trying to 
                         convince himself of something he 
                         doesn't believe in his heart. Each 
                         of us has a destiny, for good or for 
                         evil.

                                     RICK
                         Yes, I get the point.

               Rick lights his cigarette.

                                     LASZLO
                         I wonder if you do. I wonder if you 
                         know that you're trying to escape 
                         from yourself and that you'll never 
                         succeed.

                                     RICK
                         You seem to know all about my destiny.

                                     LASZLO
                         I know a good deal more about you 
                         than you suspect. I know, for 
                         instance, that you are in love with 
                         a woman. It is perhaps strange that 
                         we both should be in love with the 
                         same woman. The first evening I came 
                         here in this cafe, I knew there was 
                         something between you and Ilsa. Since 
                         no one is to blame, I, I demand no 
                         explanation. I ask only one thing. 
                         You won't give me the letters of 
                         transit. All right. But I want my 
                         wife to be safe. I ask you as a favor 
                         to use the letters to take her away 
                         from Casablanca.

                                     RICK
                         You love her that much?

                                     LASZLO
                         Apparently you think of me only as 
                         the leader of a cause. Well, I am 
                         also a human being.

               He looks away for a moment.

                                     LASZLO
                         Yes, I love her that much.

               Suddenly there is a CRASH at the door of the cafe, followed 
               by the forced entry of several gendarmes. A French officer 
               walks in and addresses Laszlo.

                                     FRENCH OFFICER
                         Mr. Laszlo?

                                     LASZLO
                         Yes?

                                     FRENCH OFFICER
                         You will come with us. We have a 
                         warrant for your arrest.

                                     LASZLO
                         On what charge?

                                     FRENCH OFFICER
                         Captain Renault will discuss that 
                         with you later.

                                     RICK
                         It seems that destiny has taken a 
                         hand.

               Laszlo looks for a moment at Rick, then in dignified silence 
               crosses to the officer. Together they walk toward the door.

               Rick's eyes follow them, but his expression reveals nothing 
               of his feelings.

               CUT TO:

               INT. RENAULT'S OFFICE - MORNING

               Renault sits at his desk and smokes while Rick nervously 
               fingers his hat. They're interrupted by an orderly.

               Renault hands some forms to the orderly, who then exits, and 
               the conversation continues.

                                     RICK
                         But you haven't any actual proof, 
                         and you know it. This isn't Germany 
                         or occupied France. All you can do 
                         is fine him a few thousand francs 
                         and give him thirty days. You might 
                         as well let him go now.

                                     RENAULT
                         Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too 
                         interested in what happens to Laszlo. 
                         If by any chance you were to help 
                         him escape --

                                     RICK
                         -- What makes you think I'd stick my 
                         neck out for Laszlo?

                                     RENAULT
                         Because one, you've bet ten thousand 
                         francs he'd escape. Two, you have 
                         the letters of transit, now don't 
                         bother to deny it. And, well, you 
                         might do it simply because you don't 
                         like Strasser's looks. As a matter 
                         of fact, I don't like him either.

                                     RICK
                         Well, they're all excellent reasons.

                                     RENAULT
                         Don't count too much on my friendship, 
                         Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. 
                         Besides, I might lose ten thousand 
                         francs.

                                     RICK
                         You're not very subtle, but you are 
                         effective. I, I get the point. Yes, 
                         I have the letters, but I intend 
                         using them myself. I'm leaving 
                         Casablanca on tonight's plane, the 
                         last plane.

                                     RENAULT
                         Huh?

                                     RICK
                         And I'm taking a friend with me. One 
                         you'll appreciate.

                                     RENAULT
                         What friend?

                                     RICK
                         Ilsa Lund.
                         (pause)
                         That ought to put your mind to rest 
                         about my helping Laszlo escape. The 
                         last man I want to see in America.

                                     RENAULT
                         You didn't come here to tell me this. 
                         You have the letters of transit. You 
                         can fill in your name and hers and 
                         leave any time you please. Why are 
                         you interested in what happens to 
                         Laszlo?

               Renault gets out of his chair and crosses to the front of 
               his desk.

                                     RICK
                         I'm not. But I am interested in what 
                         happens to Ilsa and me. We have a 
                         legal right to go, that's true. But 
                         people have been held in Casablanca 
                         in spite of their legal rights.

               Renault retrieves a fresh cigarette from a box on his desk.

                                     RENAULT
                         What makes you think we want to hold 
                         you?

               Renault chain-lights his new cigarette with the old one.

                                     RICK
                         Ilsa is Laszlo's wife. She probably 
                         knows things that Strasser would 
                         like to know. Louis, I'll make a 
                         deal with you. Instead of this petty 
                         charge you have against him, you can 
                         get something really big, something 
                         that would chuck him in a 
                         concentration camp for years. That 
                         would be quite a feather in your 
                         cap, wouldn't it?

                                     RENAULT
                         It certainly would. Germany... Vichy 
                         would be very grateful.

                                     RICK
                         Then release him. You be at my place 
                         a half hour before the plane leaves.

               Renault sits back down in his chair.

                                     RICK
                         I'll arrange to have Laszlo come 
                         there to pick up the letters of 
                         transit, and that'll give you the 
                         criminal grounds on which to make 
                         the arrest. You get him, and we get 
                         away. To the Germans that last will 
                         be just a minor annoyance.

                                     RENAULT
                         (puzzled)
                         There's still something about this 
                         business I don't quite understand. 
                         Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, 
                         yes, but you were never interested 
                         in any woman.

                                     RICK
                         Well, she isn't just any woman.

               Rick stares at the floor, then looks back up at Renault.

                                     RENAULT
                         I see. How do I know you'll keep 
                         your end of the bargain?

                                     RICK
                         I'll make the arrangements right now 
                         with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.

                                     RENAULT
                         Ricky, I'm going to miss you. 
                         Apparently you're the only one in 
                         Casablanca who has even less scruples 
                         than I.

                                     RICK
                         Oh, thanks.

                                     RENAULT
                         Go ahead, Ricky.

               Renault presses a button on his desk, triggering a BUZZER.

               The door to Renault's office opens. Rick rises to go.

                                     RICK
                         And by the way, call off your 
                         watchdogs when you let him go. I 
                         don't want them around this afternoon. 
                         I'm taking no chances, Louis, not 
                         even with you.

               CUT TO:

               INT. THE BLUE PARROT - DAY

               A waiter brings tea to Rick and Ferrari, who sit alone at a 
               table in a secluded nook off the main room.

                                     FERRARI
                         Shall we draw up the papers, or is 
                         our handshake good enough?

                                     RICK
                         It's certainly not good enough. But 
                         since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to 
                         do.

               Ferrari pours a cup for Rick, who takes a sip.

                                     FERRARI
                         Ah, to get out of Casablanca and go 
                         to America! You're a lucky man.

                                     RICK
                         Oh, by the way, my agreement with 
                         Sam's always been that he gets twenty-
                         five percent of the profits. That 
                         still goes.

                                     FERRARI
                         Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets 
                         ten percent. But he's worth twenty-
                         five.

                                     RICK
                         And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they 
                         stay with the place, or I don't sell.

                                     FERRARI
                         Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't 
                         be Rick's without them.

                                     RICK
                         Well, so long.

               Rick gets up, followed by Ferrari. They shake hands to seal 
               the deal.

               He walks to the door, then stops and turns around.

                                     RICK
                         Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred 
                         cartons of American cigarettes.

                                     FERRARI
                         I shall remember to pay it... to 
                         myself.

               Rick leaves. Ferrari picks up a fly swatter from the table 
               and swats at a fly.

               CUT TO:

               EXT. RICK'S CAFE - NIGHT

               A car pulls quickly to a stop just outside the cafe.

               On the door a huge placard reads:

               CLOSED
               By Order of the Prefect of Police.

               CUT TO:

               INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

               Rick sits at a table inside and reads the letters of transit.

               He hears a KNOCK on the door and puts them away in his pocket.

               He opens the door and Renault walks in.

                                     RICK
                         You're late.

                                     RENAULT
                         I was informed just as Laszlo was 
                         about to leave the hotel, so I knew 
                         I'd be on time.

                                     RICK
                         I thought I asked you to tie up your 
                         watchdogs.

                                     RENAULT
                         Oh, he won't be followed here.

               Renault looks around the empty cafe.

                                     RENAULT
                         You know, this place will never be 
                         the same without you, Ricky.

                                     RICK
                         Yes, I know what you mean, but I've 
                         already spoken to Ferrari. You'll 
                         still win at roulette.

                                     RENAULT
                         Is everything ready?

               Rick points at his breast pocket.

                                     RICK
                         I have the letters right here.

                                     RENAULT
                         Tell me, when we searched the place, 
                         where were they?

                                     RICK
                         Sam's piano.

                                     RENAULT
                         Serves me right for not being musical.

               They hear the CRUNCH of tires as a car pull up.

                                     RICK
                         Oh. Here they are. You'd better wait 
                         in my office.

               Renault walks up the stairs to Rick's office.

               CUT TO:

               EXT. RICK'S CAFE - NIGHT

               Laszlo pays the cab driver. Ilsa quickly walks toward the 
               entrance.

                                     LASZLO
                         (to driver)
                         Here.

               Rick opens the door. Ilsa rushes in. Her intensity reveals 
               the strain she is under. Rick grabs her by both arms and 
               pulls her close.

                                     ILSA
                         Richard, Victor thinks I'm leaving 
                         with him. Haven't you told him?

                                     RICK
                         No, not yet.

                                     ILSA
                         But it's all right, isn't it? You 
                         were able to arrange everything?

                                     RICK
                         Everything is quite all right.

                                     ILSA
                         Oh, Rick!

               She looks at him with a vaguely questioning look.

                                     RICK
                         We'll tell him at the airport. The 
                         less time to think, the easier for 
                         all of us. Please trust me.

               Ilsa pauses and looks at Rick, unsure for a moment.

                                     ILSA
                         Yes, I will.

               Laszlo comes in and closes the door behind himself.

                                     LASZLO
                         Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to 
                         thank you.

                                     RICK
                         Oh, save it. We've still lots of 
                         things to do.

               They all walk towards the bar. Laszlo deposits his hat on a 
               a nearby table.

               CUT TO:

               INT. RICK'S CAFE - OFFICE - NIGHT

               Renault opens the office door and peers down at the 
               proceedings.

               CUT TO:

               INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

                                     LASZLO
                         I brought the money, Monsieur Blaine.

                                     RICK
                         Keep it. You'll need it in America.

                                     LASZLO
                         But we made a deal.

                                     RICK
                         (cutting him short)
                         Oh, never mind about that. You won't 
                         have any trouble in Lisbon, will 
                         you?

                                     LASZLO
                         No. It's all arranged.

                                     RICK
                         Good. I've got the letters right 
                         here, all made out in blank.

               He takes out the letters.

                                     RICK
                         All you have to do is fill in the 
                         signatures.

               He hands them to Laszlo, who takes them gratefully.

                                     RENAULT
                         Victor Laszlo!

               All three hear footsteps and turn to see Renault walking 
               towards them from the bottom of the stairs.

                                     RENAULT
                         Victor Laszlo, you are under arrest...
                         (as he walks toward 
                         them)
                         on a charge of accessory to the murder 
                         of the couriers from whom these 
                         letters were stolen.

               Ilsa and Laszlo are both caught completely off guard. They 
               turn towards Rick, bewildered. Horror is in Ilsa's eyes.

               Renault takes the letters.

                                     RENAULT
                         Oh, you are surprised about my friend 
                         Ricky?

               Obviously the situation delights Renault. He smiles as he 
               turns toward Rick.

                                     RENAULT
                         The explanation is quite simple. 
                         Love, it seems, has triumphed over 
                         virtue. Thank --

               Suddenly the smile fades. In Rick's hand is a gun, which he 
               levels at Renault.

                                     RICK
                         -- Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's going 
                         to be arrested. Not for a while yet.

                                     RENAULT
                         Have you taken leave of your senses?

                                     RICK
                         I have. Sit down over there.

                                     RENAULT
                         Put that gun down.

               Renault then walks toward Rick. Rick puts out his arm to 
               stop him.

                                     RICK
                         Louis, I wouldn't like to shoot you, 
                         but I will, if you take one more 
                         step.

               Renault halts for a moment and studies Rick.

                                     RENAULT
                         Under the circumstances, I will sit 
                         down.

               He walks to a table and sits.

                                     RICK
                         (sharply)
                         Keep your hands on the table.

               He takes out a cigarette case.

                                     RENAULT
                         I suppose you know what you're doing, 
                         but I wonder if you realize what 
                         this means?

                                     RICK
                         I do. We've got plenty of time to 
                         discuss that later.

                                     RENAULT
                         Call off your watch-dogs you said.

                                     RICK
                         Just the same, you call the airport 
                         and let me hear you tell them. And 
                         remember, this gun's pointed right 
                         at your heart.

                                     RENAULT
                         That is my least vulnerable spot.

               As Renault picks up the phone and dials, Rick takes back the 
               letters.

                                     RENAULT
                         (into phone)
                         Hello, is this the airport? This is 
                         Captain Renault speaking. There'll 
                         be two letters of transit for the 
                         Lisbon plane. There's to be no trouble 
                         about them. Good.

               CUT TO:

               INT. GERMAN CONSULATE - NIGHT

               Strasser is on the phone.

                                     STRASSER
                         Hello? Hello?

               He hangs up the receiver and presses a BUZZER on his desk.

               An officer quickly enters.

                                     STRASSER
                         (to officer)
                         My car, quickly!

                                     OFFICER
                         (saluting)
                         Zu Befehl, Herr Major.

               The officer exits and Strasser resumes on the telephone.

                                     STRASSER
                         This is Major Strasser. Have a squad 
                         of police meet me at the airport at 
                         once. At once! Do you hear?

               He hangs up the receiver and, grabbing for his cap, hurriedly 
               exits.

               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

               The entire airport is surrounded by a heavy fog. The outline 
               of the transport plane is barely visible.

               CUT TO:

               INT./EXT. AIRPORT HANGAR - NIGHT

               A uniformed ORDERLY uses a telephone near the hangar door.

               On the airfield a transport plane is being readied.

                                     ORDERLY
                         Hello. Hello, radio tower? Lisbon 
                         plane taking off in ten minutes. 
                         East runway. Visibility: one and one 
                         half miles. Light ground fog. Depth 
                         of fog: approximately 500. Ceiling: 
                         unlimited. Thank you.

               He hangs up and moves to a car that has just pulled up outside 
               the hangar.

               Renault gets out while the orderly stands at attention.

               He's closely followed by Rick, right hand in the pocket of 
               his trench coat, covering Renault with a gun.

               Laszlo and Ilsa emerge from the rear of the car.

                                     RICK
                         (indicating the orderly)
                         Louis, have your man go with Mr.

               Laszlo and take care of his luggage.

                                     RENAULT
                         (bowing ironically)
                         Certainly Rick, anything you say.
                         (to orderly)
                         Find Mr. Laszlo's luggage and put it 
                         it on the plane.

                                     ORDERLY
                         Yes, sir. This way please.

               The orderly escorts Laszlo off in the direction of the plane.

               Rick takes the letters of transit out of his pocket and hands 
               them to Renault, who turns and walks toward the hangar.

                                     RICK
                         If you don't mind, you fill in the 
                         names. That will make it even more 
                         official.

                                     RENAULT
                         You think of everything, don't you?

                                     RICK
                         (quietly)
                         And the names are Mr. and Mrs. Victor 
                         Laszlo.

               Renault stops dead in his tracks, and turns around. Both 
               Ilsa and Renault look at Rick with astonishment.

                         Because you're getting on that plane.

                         (confused)
                         I don't understand. What about you?

                                     RICK
                         I'm staying here with him 'til the 
                         plane gets safely away.

               Rick's intention suddenly dawns on Ilsa.

                                     ILSA
                         No, Richard, no. What has happened 
                         to you? Last night we said --

                                     RICK
                         -- Last night we said a great many 
                         things. You said I was to do the 
                         thinking for both of us. Well, I've 
                         done a lot of it since then and it 
                         all adds up to one thing. You're 
                         getting on that plane with Victor 
                         where you belong.

                         -- You've got to listen to me. Do 
                         you have any idea what you'd have to 
                         look forward to if you stayed here? 
                         Nine chances out of ten we'd both 
                         wind up in a concentration camp. 
                         Isn't that true, Louis?

               Renault countersigns the papers.

                         I'm afraid Major Strasser would 
                         insist.

                         Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, 
                         but soon, and for the rest of your 
                         life.

                                     ILSA
                         But what about us?

                                     RICK
                         We'll always have Paris. We didn't 
                         have, we'd lost it, until you came 
                         to Casablanca. We got it back last 
                         night.

                                     ILSA
                         And I said I would never leave you.

                                     RICK
                         And you never will. But I've got a 
                         job to do, too. Where I'm going you 
                         can't follow. What I've got to do 
                         you can't be any part of. Ilsa, I'm 
                         no good at being noble, but it doesn't 
                         take much to see that the problems 
                         of three little people don't amount 
                         to a hill of beans in this crazy 
                         world. Someday you'll understand 
                         that. Now, now...

               Ilsa's eyes well up with tears. Rick puts his hand to her 
               chin and raises her face to meet his own.

                                     RICK
                         Here's looking at you, kid.

               CUT TO:

               EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

               Major Strasser drives at break-neck speed towards the airport.

               He HONKS his horn furiously.

               CUT TO:

               INT./EXT. AIRPORT HANGAR - NIGHT

               Laszlo returns. Rick walks into the hangar and Renault hands 
               him the letters. He walks back out to Laszlo.

                                     LASZLO
                         Everything in order?

                                     RICK
                         All except one thing. There's 
                         something you should know before you 
                         leave.

                                     LASZLO
                         (sensing what is coming)
                         Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to 
                         explain anything.

                                     RICK
                         I'm going to anyway, because it may 
                         make a difference to you later on. 
                         You said you knew about Ilsa and me.

                                     LASZLO
                         Yes.

                                     RICK
                         But you didn't know she was at my 
                         place last night when you were. She 
                         came there for the letters of transit. 
                         Isn't that true, Ilsa?

                                     ILSA
                         (facing Laszlo)
                         Yes.

                                     RICK
                         (forcefully)
                         She tried everything to get them, 
                         and nothing worked. She did her best 
                         to convince me that she was still in 
                         love with me, but that was all over 
                         long ago. For your sake, she pretended 
                         it wasn't, and I let her pretend.

                                     LASZLO
                         I understand.

                                     RICK
                         Here it is.

               Rick hands the letters to Laszlo.

                                     LASZLO
                         Thanks. I appreciate it.

               Laszlo extends his hand to Rick, who grasps it firmly.

                                     LASZLO
                         And welcome back to the fight. This 
                         time I know our side will win.

               On the airfield the airplane engine TURNS OVER and the 
               propellers start turning. They all turn to see the plane 
               readying for take-off.

               Ilsa looks at Rick and he returns her stare with a blank 
               expression. He then glances at Laszlo, as does Ilsa.

               Then Laszlo breaks the silence.

                                     LASZLO
                         Are you ready Ilsa?

                                     ILSA
                         Yes, I'm ready.
                         (to Rick)
                         Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.

                                     RICK
                         You better hurry, or you'll miss 
                         that plane.

               Rick watches as Ilsa and Laszlo walk very deliberately towards 
               the plane.

                                     RENAULT
                         Well I was right. You are a 
                         sentimentalist.

                                     RICK
                         Stay where you are. I don't know 
                         what you're talking about.

               Rick puts a cigarette in his mouth.

                                     RENAULT
                         What you just did for Laszlo, and 
                         that fairy tale that you invented to 
                         send Ilsa away with him. I know a 
                         little about women, my friend. She 
                         went, but she knew you were lying.

                                     RICK
                         Anyway, thanks for helping me out.

                                     RENAULT
                         I suppose you know this isn't going 
                         to be pleasant for either of us, 
                         especially for you. I'll have to 
                         arrest you of course.

                                     RICK
                         As soon as the plane goes, Louis.

               The door to the plane is closed by an attendant and it slowly 
               taxies down the field.

               Suddenly a speeding car comes to a stop outside the hangar.

               Strasser alights from the car and runs toward Renault.

                                     STRASSER
                         What is the meaning of that phone 
                         call?

                                     RENAULT
                         Victor Laszlo is on that plane.

               Renault nods toward the field. Strasser turns to see the 
               plane taxiing towards the runway.

                                     STRASSER
                         Why do you stand here? Why don't you 
                         stop him?

                                     RENAULT
                         Ask Monsieur Rick.

               Strasser looks briefly at Rick, then makes a step towards 
               the telephone just inside the hangar door.

                                     RICK
                         Get away from that phone.

               Strasser stops in his tracks, looks at Rick, and sees that 
               he is armed.

                                     STRASSER
                         (steely)
                         I would advise you not to interfere.

                                     RICK
                         I was willing to shoot Captain 
                         Renault, and I'm willing to shoot 
                         you.

               Strasser watches the plane in agony. His eyes dart towards 
               the telephone. He runs toward it and desperately grabs the 
               receiver.

                                     STRASSER
                         Hello?

                                     RICK
                         Put that phone down!

                                     STRASSER
                         Get me the Radio Tower!

                                     RICK
                         Put it down!

               Strasser, one hand holding the receiver, pulls out a pistol 
               with the other hand, and SHOOTS quickly at Rick. The bullet 
               misses its mark.

               Rick now SHOOTS at Strasser, who crumples to the ground.

               At the sound of an approaching car both men turn. A police 
               car SPEEDS in and comes to a stop near Renault. Four gendarmes 
               hurriedly jump out.

               In the distance the plane turns onto the runway.

               The gendarmes run to Renault. The first one hurriedly salutes 
               him.

                                     GENDARME
                         Mon Capitaine!

                                     RENAULT
                         Major Strasser's been shot.

               Renault pauses and looks at Rick. Rick returns Renault's 
               gaze with expressionless eyes.

                                     RENAULT
                         Round up the usual suspects.

                                     GENDARME
                         Oui, mon Capitaine.

               The gendarmes take Strasser's body away and then drive off.

               Renault walks inside the hangar, picks up a bottle of Vichy 
               water, and opens it.

                                     RENAULT
                         Well, Rick, you're not only a 
                         sentimentalist, but you've become a 
                         patriot.

                                     RICK
                         Maybe, but it seemed like a good 
                         time to start.

                                     RENAULT
                         I think perhaps you're right.

               As he pours the water into a glass, Renault sees the Vichy 
               label and quickly DROPS the bottle into a trash basket which 
               he then KICKS over.

               He walks over and stands beside Rick. They both watch the 
               plane take off, maintaining their gaze until it disappears 
               into the clouds.

               Rick and Louis slowly walk away from the hangar toward the 
               runway.

                                     RENAULT
                         It might be a good idea for you to 
                         disappear from Casablanca for a while. 
                         There's a Free French garrison over 
                         at Brazzaville. I could be induced 
                         to arrange a passage.

                                     RICK
                         My letter of transit? I could use a 
                         trip. But it doesn't make any 
                         difference about our bet. You still 
                         owe me ten thousand francs.

                                     RENAULT
                         And that ten thousand francs should 
                         pay our expenses.

                                     RICK
                         Our expenses?

                                     RENAULT
                         Uh huh.

                                     RICK
                         Louis, I think this is the beginning 
                         of a beautiful friendship.

               The two walk off together into the night.

               FADE OUT:

               THE END
