After the suicide of her only friend, Rachel has never felt more on the outside.
The one person who reached out to her, Jessie, also happens to be part of the popular crowd that lives to torment outsiders like her.

But as Rachel slowly learns to trust, a terrible trap is being laid for her.
And making her angry could prove to be fatal.
