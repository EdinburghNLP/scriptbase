                                                      13 FEBRUARY 1998
                         

                         
          "I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
          That would save you dear lady from going insane"
          Bob Dylan, Tombstone Blues                   

                         

                         

                         
          BLACK

          MUSIC UP: Slow, sad, ethereal.
          Perhaps even eerie.

          FADE IN:

          On a sea of red, filling the frame. A crimson ocean without
          waves or ripples.

          A thick housepainter's BRUSH dips in, revealing its paint.
          The BRUSH is extracted, paint dripping like congealing blood.
          FOLLOW THE BRUSH to reveal...

          INT. A HOUSE - NIGHT

          A white wall, where the BRUSH is moved horizontally, leaving
          a thick continuous stripe, until the paint thins out.
          A WOMAN'S HAND plunges the BRUSH back into the paint can,
          then takes up creating the stripe again, painting the wall:
          until it reaches &pleated drape --
          -- and doesn't stop. A window and another drape receive the
          same treatment before the BRUSH is re-dipped.

          A PUPPY,
          a sad-eyed basset hound, sits on the floor watching, a bit
          perplexed. This is WALTER and even he knows this is weird.
          The dog looks over to...

          A FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL
          standing next to him, also watching. This is RACHEL. Dark
          haired, in a plain dress. Her large eyes are welling on the
          verge of tears.

          The BRUSH is dragged across the wall, hits a wooden picture
          frame, moves across a cheap oil painting of a pastoral,
          forest scene, and over the other edge of the frame.

          Another ANGLE takes in the red line, five feet high, parallel
          to the floor, extending around a modest living room.

          Painting the line is BARBARA LANG, in her thirties, yet worn,
          haggard- She hasn't slept in a while.

          The precision of her work, her concentration, her focus, as
          the line runs across a wall and into a corner, is more than a
          little frightening.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         RACHEL

                         Mommy

          BARBARA hears nothing, says nothing, just wipes a paint drip.
          This is a very careful line.

                         RACHEL
          Momma, come play with me. In my room.
          But her mother keeps painting across a door.

                         RACHEL
          Right now, mommy, okay?
          BARBARA looks at her, or rather through her. And continues
          her task. RACHEL steps forward, tugs on her mom's

                         RACHEL
          I got a idea, we could--
          -- and gets , , splat, right-in the face with the brush

                         THE KITCHEN
           A TOY AMBULANCE sits on the floor. RACHEL's tiny hand
           deliberately presses a button on it. The TOY responds with a
          wheep whe ep siren, then:

                         AMBULANCE VOICE

                         (CANNED; TINNY)
          If you need help, dial nine one one.
          If you need help, dial nine one one.

          A WALL-MOUNTED PHONE
          RACHEL's HAND struggles to reach the buttons to dial 9-1-1.
          BARBARA's still painting the wall in the background.

          RACHEL (O.S.)
          Hello? It's my mom. She's doing
          some... some wrong things. She's
          doing wrong things, so, and, you
          should come.

          EXT. THE STREET - FROM ABOVE - NIGHT

          A light rain falls on an AMBULANCE sitting next to a POLICE
          Its dashing red lights
          CRUISER with its doors flung open.
          splash over the umbrella carrying NEIGHBORS, in pajamas and
          robes, watching...

                         

                         

                         

                         
          TWO E.M.S. WORKERS drag a struggling BARBARA across a lawn,
          her hands in plastic restraining cuffs.
          A wet RACHEL stands by a kneeling POLICE OFFICER holding a
          poncho over her head.

                         POLICEMAN
          Rachel? Rachel, are you okay?
          She keeps staring off, watching her mother being stuffed into
          the ambulance.

                         RACHEL
          Momma!
          She starts towards her, but the OFFICER holds her back.

                         POLICEMAN
          Honey, she just has to go somewhere,
          to get some rest, so she'll feel
          better.
          As the AMBULANCE pulls away, RACHEL catches a glimpse of her
          mother in the rear windows, watching her.

                         POLICEMAN
          is your dad around? When's he get
          home from work?
          I don't have a dad.
          The POLICEMAN collects himself.

                         POLICEMAN
          Okay. Then we're going to take you
          someplace nice, with a family, a
          really nice family, till we get all
          this sorted out.

                         (QUIETLY)
          No.

                         POLICMIAN

                         WE'LL JUS

                         RACHEL
          She breaks free, races into.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

          INT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT

          Where she runs down the entrance hall. Behind her, outside,
          as the POLICEMAN runs toward the front door, it --
          SLAMS by itself, right in his face.
          FOLLOW RACHEL as she rushes through the living room and down
          a hall. Another door slams shut behind her.

                         HER ROOM
          She spins, frightened by the door that closed behind her. To
          her left...
          A WINDOW crashes shut, startling her. Then, like a wave
          moving in a circle around her, another WINDOW bangs down, a
          DOOR slams shut, another WINDOW. Scared, RACHEL backs into

                         A CLOSET
          where she finds WALTER huddling and cradles him in her arms.
          The CLOSET DOOR swings shut, sealing her off from the world.

                         FROM ABOVE
          In the dark, RACHEL is in a fetal position on the floor, dry
          eyed, in shock, curled around her puppy.
          There's the far-off sound of POUNDING on a door.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          NT. A DARKENED BEDROOM - DAWN
          RACHEL, now 17, is curled in bed around WALTER, also now a
          far more senior dog. She's enmeshed in tangled white
          Small TATTOOS come into view -- A delicate angel with broken
          wings on her ankle. A small EGYPTIAN ANKH is etched on her
          shoulder blade.
          Wrapped around her upper arm is an elegant THORN BAND
          encircling a HEART, either protecting or imprisoning it.
          There's a knock on her bedroom door.

          WOMAN (O.S.)
          Rachel. c et up. You're gonna be late
          again.
          She rolls over, blinks awake. She's beautiful, with sensual
          lips framed by raven black hair.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         RACHEL
          joy.

                         CUT TO
          BLACK. A SUPER burns in:

           M. O N D A Y

                          FADE INTO:

          A PAN AROUND RACHEL'S ROOM
          the usual teenage mess, clothes strewn everywhere. A POSTER
          of Jim Morrison reads: "No One Here Gets Out Alive."
          RACHEL stands before her dresser mirror, in a ratty bathrobe,
          putting on a small nose stud. She dons her daily armor --
          -- Slipping on multiple earrings.
          -- Applying Kohl around her eyes.
          -- Shrugging on a T-shirt with a photo of Sharon Tate
          captioned "Manson Sucks".
          -- Disheveling her long black hair.
          Scooping up WALTER, she kisses him, takes him to an open
          ground floor window.
          Sorry, Walt.
          And gently lowers him outside.

          EXT. A HOUSE - MORNING

          It's not the home RACHEL lived in with BARBARA. This one is
          run down and in the section of town where people have cars in
          their yards they've abandoned tinkering with. The lawn is
          overgrown, there's broken glass on the street.

          INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

          The crammed eat-in-kitchen of the WALLACE house. EMILYN,
          40's, is ironing a waitress uniform on the counter. A groggy
          BOYD, 40's, enters, he's a trucker and looks like one. He
          goes straight for the refrigerator.
          BOYD and his wife EMILYN have taken in RACHEL as a foster kid
          to augment their income.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.
           RACHEL is alone at a formica table, eating cereal. BOYD
          looks at his ..rife.

                         BOYD

                         (YAWNS)
          Working tonight?

                         EMILYN
          Graveyard shift, again.

                         (TO RACHEL)
          Was the dog in the house last night?
          He's allowed in the morning.

                         BOYD
          (head in refrigerator)
          Daytime, yes; nighttime, no. We've
          been over this ground.
          I only brought him in this morning.
          No juice?

                         EMILYN
          We're out of a lot of things.

                         (TO RACHEL)
          I heard dog noises last night.
          When I was trying to sleep.

                         (LOUDER)
          Walter was not in the house last
          night.

                         BOYD
          (shoots Rachel a look)
          You watch that voice in this house.
          While you're here, you'll respect her
          as your mother, and treat her as such.

                         RACHEL
          (lowers her eyes, mumbles)
          Sorry.
          She picks through her cold cereal in silence.

                         EMILYN
          Your mom's making progress isn't she,
          on the new medicacions, the
          tricyclics?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.

                         RACHEL
          Yes, ma'am.

                         (BEAT)
          May I be excused?
          Without waiting for a reply, she stands and gathers the bowl.
          (casually, a routine)
          And you should take that thing outta
          your nose. Don't you have enough
          holes in your head?
          As she turns away, RACHEL makes a face, but replies.

                         RACHEL
          Yes, sir.

          EXT. HOUSE - MORNING

          RACHEL stands outside, clad in a long dark overcoat, with a
          black backpack. WALTER sits next to her, behind a fence.
          A YELLOW SCHOOL BUS pulls up.

                         RACHEL
          Later, Walt.
          On WALTER, bummed.

          WITHIN THE SCHOOL BUS
          A gaggle of young KIDS in faded denims and pastels. RACHEL
          moves to the back, sits with LISA PARKER, who could be her
          younger sister, also dressed Goth, black lace and metal.
          LISA has a HEART-THORN TATTOO around her arm, like RACHEL's.

                         LISA

                         (SMILES)
          Well, hullo.

                         RACHEL
          She speaks. She opens her mouth
          and sounds come out. The sounds
          are words.
          LTA gives her a Cheshire cat grin.

                         LISA
          What's wrong, fcscer-dad bein' a
          pain again?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.

                         RACHEL
          Why are you so weiz.ly happy?

                         LISA
          o I look any different?

                         RACHEL
          Do you look any...

                         (GETTING IT)
          Oh, my gawd. You did it.

                         LISA
          Yep.
          With who?

                         LISA
          You'd never believe me if I told you.
          I'm bringing him to lunch.

                         RACHEL
          C'mon. ' 1 Fess up.

                         LISA
          All will be revealed in due time.
          RACHEL pulls out a worn Anne Rice paperback from her ba
          gives it to LISA.

                         RACHEL
          You suck.

                         LISA
          I love you too.
          Simultaneously, they bite their thumbs, then press them
          together; a pantomime of blood sisters.

                         LISA / RACHEL
          Best Blood. / Best Blood.
          ARNIE, a skinny, pimply stoner, plops into the seat behind
          them, sticks his head on their seatback, smiles full braces.

                         ARNIE
          Hi there gruesome twosome, how 'bout
          a threesome?

                         LISA
          (ignoring him, to Rachel)
          Lunch. Meet me in the parking lot.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.

          EXT. BERGEN HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING

          A modern, windowless school, shrouded in mist. It's
          beautiful in an eerie "Fall of the House of Usher" way.

          E SCHOOL ENTRANCE - MORNING
          Hung over the concrete entrance is a large bedsheet BANNER
          with oversized red lettering:

          CRUSH CARLIN FRIDAY!
          The school mascot, a scrappy BULLDOG wearing a CROWN tilted
          at a rakish angle, is also drawn on the banner.
          FADE IN -- KNOTS of STUDENTS, like spectral figures.
          The two major school cliques are...
          on the front steps. Land of burnouts, step-kids, Metalheat s
          skateboard junkiei-and other lost souls.
          A STONER KID kicks his skateboard up and catches it. HIS
          BUDDY follows suit and misses, suffering the embarrassment of
          watching his board shoot down the steps whose metal rail
          separates Freak Hall and..,

                         THE PATIO
          a courtyard with concrete tables where the school's royalty
          hold court. The cleancut "Patio People" are the jocks,
          student government types and others who have no idea what it
          is to be alone on a Saturday night.
          At the patio is a pack of muscular jocks in football letter
          jackets reading "Bulldogs", some sport caps marked "Dawgs:
          There's JESSE RYAN, handsome, longish hair, a young Eddie
          Vedor if Eddie ever played football. Next to him is...
          MARK BING, good looking, with a body like a fist.
          Behind them, arrayed around a concrete table are the large,
          doltish BRAD, hearty rich boy CHUCK, and the arrogant ERIC.
          CHUCKS looks over a plain looking GIRL on the Patio.

                         CHUCK
          (aside, low)
          Hey, Mark, the girl over there,
          how many if I do her?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.
          Six.

                         BRAD

                         (MIFFED)
          Hold it. I did her last week,
          I only got five.

                         MARK
          She was having a bad hairday.
          A group of PATIO GIRLS sit at another table. Among them is
          MONICA, a stunning brunette, AMY a cute redhead and TRACY, an
          icy BLONDE who could spend all day checking her makeup.
          JESSE looks over. TRACY graces him with a smile and turns
          away. MARK leans in to JESSE.

                         MARK
          Hey, Jess. Tracy, she wants you, man.
          Jump her bones.

                         I JESSE
          Yeah, whatever.

                         CHUCK
          What's the matter with you, she's got
          an ass stamped "Made in Heaven

                         JESSE
          I don't know, you ever have a
          conversation with her? It's like
          talking down a well. She only wants
          me cause I'm on the football team.

                         MARK
          So what? You want her to want you
          cause of your dazzling personality?
          Look, you want someone to talk to,
          you got us. H, you screw.

          THE SCHOOL BUS
          RACHEL and LISA hop off and walk past the Patio. CHUCK
          watches LISA pass.

                         CHUCK

                         (ASIDE)
          Woof- Coyote date.

                         JESSE
          That's harsh, man, keep it down.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         11

                         ERIC
          What's a coyote date?

                         MARK
          When you wake up in the morning, and
          she's sleeping on your arm, and the
          only way to get up is to wake her.
          So you gnaw your arm off instead.
          BRAD snorts a laugh.
          A goatee'd ENGLISH TEACHER nods to both camps as he passes.

                         ENGLISH TEACHER
          Hello Montagues, hello Capulets.
          A BELL goes off and the STUDENTS start filing into school.
          LISA waves the tips of her fingers to RACHEL, bye-bye.
          RACHEL looks over, catches a glimpse of JESSE, across the
          line of demarcation. For a piece of a second it seems as if
          he's looking back. She drops her head, walks away.

          INT. ENGLISH CLASS - DAY

          The ENGLISH TEACHER strolls among the student's desk. RACHEL
          is in social Siberia, sitting in the back.

                         ENGLISH TEACHER
          Okay, then how many saw the movie?
          A show of hands, all the girls, some of the boys.

                         ENGLISH TEACHER
          Now, how many read the play?

                         AS ASSIGN
          A few tentative hands, including JESSE.

                         ENGLISH TEACHER
          I thank you for your honesty, but I am
          saddened. I'd like to think we're
          here to study William Shakespeare, not
          worship at the altar of Leo DiCaprio.
          Scattered laughs.

                         ENGLISH TEACHER
          I was going to calk about the
          language. But since you haven't Z&&d
          the language, let's talk about the
          plot.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.
          Sighs of relief

                         ENGLISH TEACHER
          Romeo and Juliet, a tale of two lovers
          meant for each other, pulled apart by
          their families, society, and, some
          might say, by fate.

                         (BEAT)
          Why is it that we are so moved by love
          stories that end with separation?
          The STUDENT' s faces are blank.

                         ENGLISH TEACHER
          What are some other stories with this
          theme?

                         (NO RESPONSES)
          How about, Dr. Zhivago? Casablanca?
          Still blank. AMY timidly raises her hand.

                         AMY
          You meair like in Dumb and
          when the girl's husband showed up?
          The TEACHER surrenders to the inevitable.

                         ENGLISH TEACHER
          Okay, well. Perhaps at some level
          we know that Lauren Holly's husband
          AIM to show up? What say? Anyone?

                         (BEAT)
          Rachel?
          I don't know that I believe in it.

                         ENGLISH TEACHER
          Believe in what?

                         RACHEL
          Love.
          JESSE looks at her, pensive.

                         ENGLISH TEACHER

                         (SYMPATHETIC)
          Well, then you've got bigger problems
          than passing this crass.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

                         ARNIE
          (raises his hand)
          Love is fifteen seconds of squishing
          noises. Unquote. Johnny Rotten.
          Scattered laughs. JESSE overhears TRACY as she nods at
          RACHEL, whispers to AMY...

                         TRACY
          Who would love her?

                         ENGLISH TEACHER
          Do you think that all love stories are
          tragedies? I mean, unless they die at
          the same time, all lovers are
          eventually separated by death.

                         JESSE
          Well, then Romeo and Juliet isn't a
          tragedy, because the only way they
          could really be together was in death.

                         ENGLISH TEACHER
          Very good.
          (nods at Rachel)
          A foul cynic, most cliche.
          (turns to Jesse)
          A true romantic, how refreshing.
          Kids scoff at JESSE, but RACHEL eyes JESSE, struck by this
          side of him.
          The BELL rings and ARNIE leads the exodus.

                         ARNIE
          Food!

                         ENGLISH TEACHER
          Next assignment, Brave New World, the
          book, not the TV movie.

          INT, HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY
          A stone-faced LISA folds a NOTE, places it within her hallway
          locker, jammed to the brim with books; a photo of Fiona Apple
          and a Nine Inch Nails sticker are plastered on its door.

          EXT. ICE SCHOOL. THE REAR PARKING LOT - LUNCHTIME

          STUDENTS pour out the doors, some heading to a row of outside
          lockers. RACHEL appears, searching for LISA.

                         BACK TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.

          THE SCHOOL HALLWAY
          LISA walks as if moving through extremely dense air, hugging
          the wall as STUDENTS pass without acknowledging her.

                         HACK TO:

          THE PARKING LOT
          RACHEL looks around the students, sees a GIRL's HEAD from
          behind, realizes it isn't LISA.

                         BACK TO:

                         A STAIRWELL
          LISA ascends several flights, still brushing the wall,
          exiting onto the...

                         SCHOOL'S ROOF
          She walks past a TRIO OF STUDENTS smoking near the roof's
          edge. Without slowing or blinking an eyelash LISA simply..

          DROPS OUT OF FRAME.
          A GIRL turns in the direction of LISA's disappearance.

                         SMOKING GIRL
          Did you see that?

          SHOCK CUT TO:

          WITHIN A PARKED CAR
          LISA'S FACE smashes into the windshield which cracks in a
          spider web pattern. Blood fills the web. The sound of a
          droplet hitting car vinyl, then drops SPLATTER RED on our

          P.Q.V.

          EXT. THE SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY

          Standing in the lot is RACHEL. She stares in horror at --
          LISA sprawled on the dented hood of a parked car, her head a
          bloody mass nestled in the shattered windshield.
          -- and RACHEL opens her mouth, but the SCREAM BOTTLED inside
          catches in her throat, which causes --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

          A ROW OF OUTDOOR LOCKERS
          to "ULQ open, behind her, like dominoes, banging in a wave
          away from her, startling KIDS near them.

          INT. SCHOOL - DAY

          BANG as a door marked "GUIDANCE COUNSELOR" swings open and..
          SUE SNELL whips around in her seat, late 30's, but with the
          eyes of someone who's been to hell and back. A YOUNG GIRL is
          seated before her for counseling.
          in her doorway is the SCHOOL PRINCIPAL, chaos in the hall
          behind him.

                         PRINCIPAL
          You'd better come with me, a girl just
          killed herself in the lot.

          EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY.

          More chaos. KIDS'rush in to see, others move away.
          Next to the car with LISA's body is RACHEL. Slowly,
          tentatively, without knowing what she's doing, RACHEL runs
          her hand along the car's hood, coating her thumb with blood.

                         RACHEL

                         (TO HERSELF)
          Best blood.
          SUE pushes her way through the crowd, sees a stunned RACHEL,
          puts an arm around her shoulder.

                         SUE
          Corns. Come with me. Let's back off.
          One step. Good. Let's back away.
          PULL BACK to see the widening circles of shock as the
          students of Bergen High realize what's just occurred.

          INT. GUIDANCE OFFICE - DAY

          A SNOW DOME with a forest scene. RACHEL is in a chair, her
          face an ashen mask, staring at the dome on the desk. SUE
          offers a glass of water, RACHEL doesn't take it. SUE leans
          on the desk's edge.

                         SUE
          (low, intimace)
          Was she a friend? This is a place
          where you can calk about it.

                         (MORE)

                         SUE (CONC'D)

                         (NO RESPONSE)
          Or not. But if you need to, I'm
          always here.
          SUE takes RACHEL's hand. RACHEL looks up at her, eyes
          welling. Bur she doesn't cry.

                         SUE
          It's okay. Let it out.

                         RACHEL
          (shakes her head)
          I never cry. Miss Snell? She was so
          happy this morning. I don't
          understand. Why would she--
          The INTERCOM BOX squawks:

          WOMAN (V.0.)
          Ms. Snell, would you please come to
          the principal's office? Ms. Snell,
          please come to the principal's office.

                         - SUE
          You stay here as long as you need to.
          RACHEL nods. SUE moves to the door and exits.
          Leaving RACHEL alone, looking all of five years old.

          INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY

          A medium-sized office, standing room only. The PRINCIPAL
          addresses SUE and his STAFF as he hands out sheets of paper.

                         PRINCIPAL
          The board of education has given us
          these procedures to follow. I want
          every teacher to read this aloud in
          their classrooms in ten minutes.
          Do not digress or become overly
          emotional or dramatic.
          His VOICE under...

          EXT. THE SCHOOL ENTRANCE - DAY

          A door BANGS open as RACHEL runs out and down the steps.

          PRINCIPAL (V_O.)
          Then I'll ask you to identify any
          students who may have been Lisa
          Parker's close friends and therefore
          may require additional counseling.

                         (PAUSE)
          Copycats. Everybody got it?
          Nods all around.

                         PRINCI PAL
          Then let's go with the drill.
          A TEACHER reads from the prepared statement to her class.

                         TEACHER
          One of our students died today.
          -- A FOREST -- Glimpses of RACHEL running through the trees.
          -- SUE at a microphone, reading from a sheet of paper:

                         SUE
          We will observe, at exactly two
          p.m...
          -- Her voice emanates from an INTERCOM BOX high on a

          not be forgotten by her friends.

          INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

          ERIC surreptitiously passes MARK something under a desk, a
          large pocket NOTEBOOK.
          A GIRL picks her nose. A 3CY yawns. Another BOY absently
          fiddles with his crucifix as he reads a comic book.

          A GIRL and a BOY whisper to each other, then stifle a laugh.

          SUE {V.0.)
          She will not be forgotten, by her
          fellow students, her teachers, and
          her school.

          EXT. THE FOREST - DAY

          RACHEL sits on rock in a clearing, observing her own moment
          of silence.
          She looks at her hand. It's trembling and still covered with
          LISA's BLOOD.

          She changes into a white cotton shirt.

          INT. STATE HOSPITAL, VISITING AREA - DAY

          The dilapidated room is a statue garden of catatonics and
          depressives seated on vinyl furniture before a static-filled
          T.V. PATIENTS shuffle past like motorized corpses.
          BARBARA LANG, now in her 40's, sits on a couch with a
          transformed RACHEL. BARBARA is lucid and beaming at her.

                         BARBARA
          Yes, baby, I really am feeling so much
          better. I feel so good on the inside,
          I must be glowing on the outside.

                         RACHEL
          You look great, mama.

                         BARBARA
          Lord, you come all the way out here,
          we can't keep talking about me. How
          are you? I wane to hear every little
          thing I'm missing.

          RACHEL takes a deep breath, working extra hard to seem happy
          and well adjusted today.

                         RACHEL
          Things are really great. Last night
          I, um, I had this slumber party, with
          some girlfriends. And this morning,
          Mrs. Wallace made us all pancakes
          before school.

                         BARBARA
          The Wallaces sure are a nice family.

                         RACHEL
          (her smile falters)
          Oh, they are. A nice family.

                         BARBARA
          What's wrong?

                         RACHEL
          Nothing, I just... I miss those crepes
          you used to make me.

                         BARBARA
          Oh, honey, those.crepes weren't
          nothing but watered down pancakes.
          (holds out her arms)
          Come here baby.
          She gives her daughter a big hug.

                         BARBARA
          Now you listen to me, the doctors say
          I'm doing well. You know what that
          means? That means someday, soon, you
          and I are gonna be eating crepes for
          breakfast, lunch and dinner.
          For the first time, RACHEL's smile is genuine.

                         RACHEL
          That would be so great.

                         BARBARA
          (holds her at arm's length)
          Oh, I look at you, remembering what
          you were like at five, at ten...
          (decides not to go down a sad path)
          All I need is a little Loving Care for
          these grey hairs and we'll make up for
          all the time we've lost.

          When Lisa asked me to lunch, she was
          actin' like were on the road to
          marriage or something. I told her to
          wake up, she was just a pump, a nut.

                         MARK
          And she freaked and took a header.

          Lisa took a picture of me with. her.

                         MARK
          Shit. Okay. I'll handle it.

                         ERIC

                         MARK
          Eric, relax, its me, Mark. I'll
          handle it.
          The WAITER sets a pitcher of soda and cups on the table.
          AT THE BAR -- MR. STARK, a rotund lawyer in his 40's, takes a
          pitcher of beer from the BARTENDER.

                         BARTENLER
          I don't see nuthin'.
          STARK strolls to the booth with the pitcher in hand. He
          sits, hiding the pitcher below table level.

                         STARK
          Hello, boys.

                         ERIC
          Hi, dad.
          STARK winks, takes MARK's empty cup and fills it with beer
          below the table.

          Great game last week. All of us on
          the town council are awful proud.
          He hands MARK the cup under the table and takes JESSE's cup.
          The PLAYERS smile at each other.

                         STARK
          So, the Bulldogs bringing home the
          state championship again this year?

                         MARK
          Absolutely. We're gonna crush Carlin

          A CRASH of metal as the lock is cut off Lisa Parker's locker
          with a pair of boltcutters held by SHERIFF KELTON, 30"s, a
          former Bulldog himself. The PRINCIPAL and SUE stand nearby.
          Opening the locker, KELTON finds LISA's NOTE. As he pulls it
          out, something falls from the note.

          24.

          INT. ROYAL PHOTOMAT - DAY

          Photos glide out of the developing machine. RACHEL pulls the
          pictures out, stops dead when she sees they're shots of LISA;
          With RACHEL, laughing. LISA with Rachel's dog.
          RACHEL's finger tenderly slides along LISA's face.
          She's shocked to find a picture of --
          LISA AND ERIC -- his arm draped around her in the backseat of
          a car. LISA's holding the camera at arm's length.
          JESSE's CAR pulls up outside. MARK sits beside him.

                         RACHEL

                         (STARTLED)
          Oh!
          She peels off her headphones.

                         JESSE
          Sorry, didn't scare you, did I?
          RACHEL turns, slides LISA's PICTURES into an envelope. MARK
          checks her out, likes what.he sees, nudges JESSE.

                         JESSE
          You're... Rachel, right?
          She nods, surprised he knows she's alive, much less knows her
          name.

                         JESSE
          I'm Jesse.

                         RACHEL
          Uh-huh. The true romantic.
          MARK leans over JESSE, his voice low now, intimate.

                         MARK
          So, Rachel, there were some pictures
          Lisa took. They have, what you might
          call sentimental value.
          She just stares at him. MARK pulls a twenty from his wallet.

                         MARK
          Twenty bucks cover it?

                         RACHEL
          No.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.

                         MARK
          What do you mean? I'll go thirty.

                         RACHEL
          They're not your pictures.

                         MARK
          Well it's not like she's gonna be
          picking them up, is it?
          RACHEL turns away. JESSE glares at MARK.

                         JESSE
          Hey, cool. it.

                         MARK
          (tries a different tack)
          Rachel, why don't I come by when you get
          off and, you know, take you for a ride?
          JESSE cocks an ear for her reply, but she doesn't answer.

                         T MARK
          C'mon, I don't bite... not unless you
          want me to.

                         RACHEL
          I don't think so.

                         MARK
          Why not?

                         RACHEL

                         (TURNS)
          Cause I'm a dyke.
          JESSE laughs. MARK doesn't. He knows she's putting him on
          and bores holes into her.

                         MARK
          Let's go, Jess.
          The car pulls away, MARK glances in the REARVIEW MIRROR at
          RACHEL, framed like a target.

                         MARK
          (low to himself)
          Bitch. I'll show you funny.
          ON RACHEL -- watching them go.
          Seconds later, a SHERIFF'S CRUISER pulls up.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.

                         KELTON
          Hi.
          He holds out Lisa's PHOTO STUB. RACHEL takes it, sees the
          name, her eyes widen.

          EXT. A HILL - NIGHT

          A star-filled sky hangs above the town's makeout spot, a hill
          overlooking Bergen. MARK and CHUCK stand outside a car
          sipping beers. JESSE's CAR, a blue G.T.Â©, is several yards
          away, with foggy windows.

          WITHIN JESSE'S CAR
          The backseat. JESSE's on top of TRACY. He pulls away from
          her. She pulls her top down, sits up.

                         JESSE
          I'm sorry, it's not you. its me.

                         TRACY
          It's okay. You should save your
          energy for the game anyway.
          JESSE opens the door, stands outside, tucking in his shirt.
          MARK and CHUCK make a crude humping gesture to JESSE. He
          hesitates, then nods at them.
          MARK pulls out the SCOREBOARD and enters JESSE's name with
          TRACY's and the number 10.

                         MARK
          He shoots, he scores.
          ON TRACY -- in the front seat, using the rearview to adjust
          her makeup, pleased with what she sees. She glances at JESSE
          as he re-enters on the driver's side.

                         TRACY
          What are you thinking about?

                         JESSE
          Nobody.

                         TRACY
          I asked what, not who.

                         JESSE
          Oh. Nothing.

                         (PAUSE)

          27.

                         JESSE (CONT'D)
          Doesn't it bother you that a girl
          offed herself today?

                         TRACY
          Why? She wasn't anybody.

                         JESSE
          What?

                         TRACY
          I mean, I didn't know her.

                         (SMILES)
          You know, I still don't have a date to
          Mark's party Friday. Hint, hint.
          She leans over and nibbles on JESSE's ear. He pulls away,
          forces a smile and turns the ignition.

          INT. RACHEL'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

          SMASH as a dish drops onto the floor. RACHEL is at the sink,
          doing dishes. She crouches to retrieve the broken plate.
          WE PAN along the chorus line of dishes, glasses, and
          silverware on the counter as the metronome of the sink
          faucet's DRIP, DRIP, DRIP and the micro-explosions of the
          soap bubbles in the water intensify to deafening levels.
          TIGHT ON a SPOON atop the counter which suddenly begins
          dancing. Pots and pans on a hanging rack start rattling.
          A RUMBLE as more dishes and utensils vibrate and rattle, as
          if by a paranormal force.
          But as RACHEL casually straightens up and looks out the
          window, it's revealed it's only...

          EXT. RACHEL' S HOUSE - NIGHT

          BOYD driving a large SEMI-TRUCK pulling alongside the tiny
          house. Its engine shuts off..,

                         THE KITCHEN
          .and the spoons and dishes stop vibrating.

                         RACHEL
          (singsong, to herself)
          Daddy's home.
          She walks to her bedroom and closes the door.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.

          EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT

          BOYD goes to shut the open fence and WALTER, the basset
          hound, scurries past him and into the street.

                         BOYD
          Come back here, mutt.

                         (WHISTLES LOUDLY)
          Aw, good riddance.
          And he closes the gate.

          INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          RACHEL lays in bed, staring at the ceiling. BOYD knocks on
          her door.

          BOYD (0.S.)
          Your dog got out. Better get'im.

          INT. JESSE'S CAR - NIGHT

          JESSE's driving alone, wiping Tracy's lipstick from his
          cheek.

          EXT. THE STREET -NIGHT

          's in her overcoat over her longjohns. She looks down
          the road and blanches as she sees WALTER trotting towards...
          The road in front of him, a two-lane blacktop with CARS and
          TRUCKS streaming by at high speed.

                         RACHEL
          Walter!
          And she breaks into a run. WALTER looks back, starts
          running, this is all fun for him.
          There's the low BLEAT of a TRUCK'S HORN and then...
          The high, piercing SQUEAL of a wounded animal.
          In the road, WALTER, laying flat, keening in pain.
          She runs to him and in one continuous motion SCOOPS him into
          her arms.
          RACHEL, in the middle of the two lanes. She turns as.__

                         HEADLIGHTS
          approach, fast.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.
          She stumbles under the dog's weight, tries flagging down a
          car.

                         RACHEL
          Help me! Please!
          It speeds past, dangerously close. Another set of LIGHTS.

                         RACHEL
          Stop! Please, stop!
          But the CAR passes, blaring its horn. She spins,around.
          is bearing down on her. She holds her ground.

                         RACHEL
          THE CAR'S WINDSHIELD -- CRACKS, crazes, as if it hit with a
          sharp, fierce projectile.
          THE CAR -- lays down rubber as it screeches to a halt.
          JESSE is at the wheel. Sees through the crazed windshield:
          RACHEL, splattered with dog's blood.
          He gets out, stares at his'windshield, shaken-up, groping for
          some explanation.

                         JESSE
          Damn. What... damn.
          RACHEL staggers up to him, holding a shivering mass of fur.

                         RACHEL

                         PLEASE--

                         JESSE
          Oh, my god.

          . JESSE'S CAR - NIGHT
          JESSE driving. RACHEL sits next to him, hugging the dog.

                         RACHEL
          It's my fault. He should have been in
          bed with me.

                         JESSE
          Everything's gonna be all right.
          His voice is not entirely convincing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.
          Through the spidered windshield: The car's headlights pierce
          the night.

          INT. THE VET'S PET CLINIC - NIGHT

          A craftsman bungalow which serves as a vet's hospital. The
          only light is over a FEMALE VET in her bathrobe, tending to
          WALTER on a shiny examining table. There are runnels on both
          sides of the table, for the blood.
          RACHEL and JESSE stand nearby.

                         RACHEL
          His name's Walter. will he be
          all right?
          The VET's intensely focused on inserting an I.V. into the
          dog.

                         VET
          You two had best wait outside.

                         JESSE
          Let's go. Best thing's to let her
          do her work.
          JESSE gently guides RACHEL away, who keeps looking back at
          her dog.

          THE WAITING ROOM - NIGHT
          RACHEL and JESSE on a couch in the darkened room. She's
          rocking herself, caked with blood. He tries to comfort her.

                         JESSE
          Your dog's gonna be okay.
          She nods, unconvinced.

                         JESSE
          God, I almost roadkilled you.
          Are you sure you're all right?
          She nods. They hear a muffled, "pmt", from the VET in the
          examining room. JESSE tries to take RACHEL's mind off it.

                         JESSE
          That tattoo on your arm, its pretty.
          Hurt a lot when you got it?

                         RACHEL
          some.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.

                         JESSE
          Yeah?

                         RACHEL
          But it's... you know, like the song
          says, you hurt yourself to see if
          you can still feel.

                         (BEAT)
          I'm sorry.

                         JESSE
          For what?

                         RACHEL
          For making you--

                         JESSE
          No problem. Glad to help, you know.

                         RACHEL
          And I'm sorry about your windshield,
          about your car.

                         JESSE
          How bizarre was that,, huh? Anyway,
          wasn't your fault.

                         RACHEL
          You can be sorry for things that
          aren't your fault.
          The VET enters, drying her hands. RACHEL sits up, bracing
          herself for the bad news. JESSE puts an arm around her seat
          back, getting ready to hold her.

                         VET
          Walter's banged up pretty bad, lost
          quite a bit of blood, but he's gonna
          make it.

                         RACHEL
          Can I see him?

                         VET
          Come back tomorrow, any time after
          eight.

          EXT. HOUSE OF BREAKFAST - NIGHT

          Your typical I.H.O.P. JESSE's CAR is parked in the lot.

          INT. BATHROOM, HOUSE OF BREAKFAST - NIGHT

          RACHEL's at the sink, washing the dog's blood from her arms.
          A WOMAN walks in, sees her. Looks alarmed.
          INT. HOUSE OF BREAKFAST - NIGi4T
          As RACHEL moves through the restaurant, THREE PATRONS stare,
          stare, stare at the blood stains on her coat.
          She slides into a booth with JESSE. He's eating eggs.

                         JESSE
          Better. You don't look like a mass-
          murderer now.
          She smiles, sips a coffee. A country song comes on the
          jukebox.

                         JESSE
          Wow, this music. Guess we should just
          count ourselves lucky it ain't Hanson.

                         RACHEL
          (a weak smile)
          Lisa hLUd them.

                         JESSE
          She was a friend of yours?
          She nods.

                         JESSE
          really sorry.

                         RACHEL
          Sometimes I'd see someone, from
          behind, and I'd know, I'd just know,
          it was Lisa. And then she'd turn
          ound, and it wasn't. But sometimes,
          you know, it was. And now...

                         (PAUSES)
          Whenever I see someone who looks like
          her, and she turns around...
          it won't be... ever.
          They both go quiet, not knowing what to say.

                         JESSE
          (looks at his latch)
          Wow. It's late. "ve got football
          practice tomorrow.

          I know. I hope I didn't ru;.n

                         JESSE
          No, if it wasn't for you I wouldn't
          have had this nutritious medl,

                         RACHEL
          You're very polite, for a jock.

                         JESSE
          The compliments, they just keep on
          comin'.
          He drops some money on the table.

                         RACHEL
          I don't have any--

                         JESSE
          's cool, I got it. Can I give you a
          Et home or something?
          I can walk

                         JESSE
          Yeah, right.

                         RACHEL
          Or hitchhike.

                         JESSE
          Right.

                         RACHEL

                         (SMILES)
          or I could wait for my limo,

                         RACHEL
          Sure.

                         JESSE
          You'll let me know how Walter's doing?

                         RACHEL
          Yeah.

                         JESSE
          Good night.
          He extends his hand. She takes it.
          3i2!
          The SHOCK of static electricity. Their words are
          simultaneous.

          They both laugh. Then go quiet. Then just stare at each
          other. Then the moment is gone.
          RACHEL gets out of the car, through the gate, back inside her
          house. JESSE watches her go. Starts his engine, and his car

          WIPES THE FRAME TO:

          EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY

          RACHEL crossing the lot. Her HEARTBEAT can be heard. She
          looks up, sees LISA approaching the roof's edge. RACHEL's
          heart sounds like its bursting from her chest.

                         RACHEL
          Lisa don't! Somebody stop her! Stop!
          SLOW MOTION -- LISA falls through the air towards the car,
          arms outstretched, hair trailing like black flames.
          SMASH -- she goes through the windshield, but the face is

          RACHEL'S.

          SLAM CUT TO:

          NT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          RACHEL's eyes pop open as her body jerks awake, heart,
          pounding. She looks around, realizes where she is.

          FADE TO BLACK:

                         A SUPER:

          T U E S D
          Under which is heard:

          KELTON (V.O.)
          "For a moment, I thought someone was
          actually seeing me. But it was all a
          lie..."

          INT. GUIDANCE OFFICE - DAY

          SHERIFF KELTON is reading from a photocopy of Lisa's
          SUE and RACHEL sit-,in chairs.

                         KELTON
          "Eric lied when he said I was special.
          And I guess I was lying to myself when
          I believed him."
          He folds the note.

                         SUE
          Rachel, is there anything in there
          that strikes a chord for you? Do you
          know what Lisa was referring to?

                         RACHEL
          (after a moment)
          Yesterday morning, she told me she'd,
          uh, lost her virginity.
          KELTON looks at SUE, produces the photo of LISA with ERIC.

                         KELTON
          You recognize this boy?

                         RACHEL
          Sure. Eric Stark. He's on the team.
          KELTON gestures to SUE and they step out into...

          with another "Heat Carlin!" banner in the background.

                         KELTON
          What do you think?

                         SUE
          Robbie, I had a Freshman crying in the
          hall last week. I couldn't get
          anything out of her, but her friend
          told me a football player slept with
          her, then dumped her.

                         KELTON
          Nothing illegal about breaking a
          girl's heart.

                         SUE
          Eric's 18. Lisa was 15. That's
          statutory rape.

                         KELTON
          That's a stretch.

                         SUE
          Then let's make it. I don't know
          what's going on around here, but if
          that's what it takes to stop it, let's
          stop it, before someone else's
          daughter kills herself.

                         KELTON
          All right. I'll look into it.

                         THE OFFICE
          SUE sits behind her desk, with RACHEL before her.

                         SUE
          How are you feeling?

                         RACHEL
          okay. Fine. Can I go no
          SUE opens a file on her desk.

                         SUE
          I was looking at chic last night.
          it says here your mom's in Arkham.

                         (BEAT)
          How's your mom doing?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.

                         RACHEL
          She's gonna be fine.

                         SUE
          I spent some time up there.
          As a patient.
          RACHEL looks surprised.

                         SUE
          Does that surprise you?

                         RACHEL
          I guess. I mean, you seem pretty
          normal.

                         SUE
          Thanks. i try. You visit your moat
          often?

                         SUE
          Is that scary for you?

                         RACHEL
          Why?

                         SUE
          Well, children of schizophrenics
          sometimes live with the fear of it
          happening to them. At your age,
          it's perfectly normal to be afraid
          of turning out like your parents.

                         RACHEL
          Normal, huh? Get real, I know I'm
          ten times more likely to get it
          than most people.

                         SUE
          You're right. I'm sorry. So.
          You've been in a series of foster
          homes since you were, what, four?

                         RACHEL N

                         SUE
          How's your foster family?

                         RACHEL
          They're happy, - 'z-rig as they get
           their check every month.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

                         SUE
          What about your real father?

                         RACHEL
          Never met the gentleman. My mom
          won't even tell me his name.
          RACHEL stares at a ceramic MUG of coffee, very close o the
          edge of the desk.

                         SUE
          Rachel, in a way, you've lost your
          mother. And now you've lost a friend.
          Losing someone can be a very lonely,
          painful place to be.

                         RACHEL

                         (QUIETLY)
          You're right, I.lost my mom, I lost my,
          friend, the people who cared about me.
          But you only get paid to care.

                         SUE
          I really do care. How can I show you
          that I do?
          RACHEL is silent, staring at the MUG.

                         SUE
          Rachel?
          But RACHEL's shut off, pushing down a storm of emotions.

                         SUE
          You know, this room is a place where
          if you have feelings, you can talk
          about them. You can let them out.
          RACHEL shifts. SUE sees RACHEL's forearm near the coffee
          MUG. And, as if by proximity alone, it EDGES off the end of
          the desk --
          And FALLS --
          RACHEL catches it in one smooth motion just before it hits.

                         RACHEL
          sorry. I must've knocked it.
          SUE, the color draining from her face.

                         SUE
          I didn't... see you knock it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.
          The DOOR swings open and the PRINCIPAL walks in, lays a
          computer printout on her desk.

                         PRINCIPAL
          Sue, could you update the absentee
          lists, see who we have to call?

                         SUE

                         (DAZED)
          ure... sure.
          She turns, and RACHEL is gone.

          NT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY
          ERIC is at his locker, wearing his BULLDOG letter jacket. He
          closes his locker to find RACHEL approaching him,
          intimidated, but determined. She looks him in the eyes.

                         RACHEL

                         (LOW)
          know. I know what you did.
          A chill goes through him. Not saying a word, he turns, walks
          through the crowd, looks back.
          She's still rooted, staring him down.

          EXT. FREAK HALL - LUNCH

          ARNIE plays hackey-sack behind RACHEL, who sits on the steps.
          She looks up, sees a BULLDOG letter jacket standing over her.
          It's JESSE.

                         JESSE
          Hi. How's Walter?

                         RACHEL

                         (COLD)
          Good. I'm picking him up today. Why
          aren't you hanging out with your
          friends over there?

                         JESSE

                         (TAKEN ABACK)
          What's up? What's wrong?
          She sees the hurt look in his eyes and softens.

                         RACHEL
          What do you wane from me?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.

                         JESSE
          I just wanted to, you know, see
          how you're doing.
          Over his shoulder she can see the stir his presence aC Freak
          Hall is causing among...

          THE PATIO GIRLS
          MONICA taps TRACY on the shoulder, who's checking her makeup
          in a compact mirror.

                         MONICA
          Look at Jesse, talking to a burnout.
          TRACY turns, slips on a stylish pair of DKNY glasses.

                         TRACY
          She's not very good in daylight is
          she? wonder where she keeps her
          coffin.

                         BACK ON:

                         JESSE
          So you'll meet me tonight, at the

                         PIZZA PLACE--

                         RACHEL
          --yeah. Okay.

                         JESSE
          (smiles, as he backs away)
          Okay. See you. Tonight.
          ARNIE sees the Patio Girls glancing at RACHEL. She sits an
          ARNIE nudges her.

                         ARNIE
          What'd he want?

                         RACHEL
          He asked me out.

                         ARNIE
          What'd you say?

                         RACHEL
          I said, "Okay, its your funeral."

                         ARNIE
          Pardon me, but is hanging out with
          jockboy such a hot idea? I mean,

                         ARNIE (CONT'D)
          I heard he's dating Tracy Campbell,
          who is giving you the look of a
          thousand deaths right now.
          RACHEL casually turns to take in TRACY, then turns away. Her
          heart sinks.

                         RACHEL
          She's beautiful.

                         ARNIE
          Duh.

          INT. FOOTBALL LOCKER ROOM - DAY

          CLOSE ON a TV SET showing game highlights of last year's
          Bulldog game against the Carlin Cougars.

          WALSH (O.S.)
          All right, as you can see from last
          year's tape, the Carlin Cougars are a
          tough, physical team. So Friday,
          it's gonna be kill or be killed.
          COACH WALSH, a charmless John Wayne, stands near the TV. The
          BULLDOGS sit on benches before him.
          On the VIDEO -.- MARK misses an easy block. WALSH points.

                         WALSH
          Here, we can see mark Sing kissing an
          opposing player good-bye.
          There are hoots of derision from the other PLAYERS. MARK
          nods. ERIC leans into MARK, speaks low.

                         ERIC
          You didn't get the picture?

                         MARK
          Bitch wouldn't give it to me. Stay
          frosty, no one else knows anything.
          It's still at the photomat, I'll
          get it.

          WALSH (O.S.)
          You two ladies back there gossiping?
          No, sir.

          WALSH (O.S. )
          Excellent. Then you can give me fifty
          when we hit the field.

          EXT. FOOTBALL PRACTICE - DAY

          JESSE and BRAD rest on a bench in their uniforms as MARK an
          ERIC do push-ups. The COACH stands on a blocking sled with
          PLAYERS Pounding into it.

                         WALSH
          C'mon girls, those are love taps!
          (sees Chuck give a weak block)
          Potter, show me you're a dog.

                         CHUCK
          Aww, coach.

                         WALSH
          You know the drill.
          The other PLAYERS begin a BARKING CHANT. CHUCK strips off
          his helmet, jogs to the bench and opens a styrofoam cooler,
          within it are slabs of raw steak on blood soaked ice..

                         WALSH
          Show me you're a dog, Potter.
          The barking rises as the PLAYERS psyche up CHUCK, who chews
          off a bite of the raw meat. JESSE whispers to MARK...

                         JESSE
          I hate this bullshit.

                         MARK
          Not me. I love it.
          MARK pops up, grabs a steak, rips off a bite, and runs full
          tilt at the, blocking tackle, smashing into it with meaning.

                         WALSH
          You're a piece of work, Bing.
          MARK takes a bow as he jogs away, chewing. He spots the
          SHERIFF's CRUISER pulling --p to the practice field.

          INT. A BUS - DAY

          RACHEL hugs her dog, who 'Looks a mess; hind legs bandaged, a
          funny cone around his head.
          TWO OLD LADIES are staring at RACHEL, unsure if they're more
          appalled by her appearance or the doge.
          WALSH c `1.O . )
          Show me you're dzgs'.

          EXT. FOOTBALL PRACTICE- LATER

          WALSH drill sergeants over MARK and the other PLAYERS as they
          do drills. The CHEERLEADERS run their practice in the'
          background.
          on the sideline, SHERIFF KELTON is talking to ERIC, who's
          sweating bullets as he fiddles with his helmet.
          MARK watches ERIC, so intent he bobbles a ball thrown to him.

                         KELTON
          So, you're saying you never met or
          talked to Lisa Parker?

                         ERIC
          No, sir. Never.
          KELTON produces the photo of LISA and ERIC.

                         N
          Eric, who's this you're hanging onto,
          a ghost?
          ERIC blanches.
          MARK watches KELTON leading ERIC away with WALSH.

          KENNEL - DAY
          A pinball machine as MARK plays, applying some body English
          to it. A wired ERIC enters, a bundle of violent energy.

                         MARK
          What happened?

                         ERIC

                         (ANGRY)
          Kelton, man, with that sheriff's badge
          he pulled out of a cereal box.
          Somebody told him I did Lisa. He
          nails me with a picture of me and her,
          starts talking statutory rape.

                         MARK
          Relax, that's bullshit. Your dad's a
          lawyer, he'll kill that talk dead.

                         ERIC
          So I'm suspended. And Coach, Coach he
          up and does this scene where he says,
          "give me your helmet."

          What about Carlin? Game of the year,
          football scouts are gonna be there and
          I'm gonna be sittin' on the bench with
          my thumb up my...
          (shoves the machine in anger)
          You said you were gonna get the
          pictures.

                         MARK
          I tried. That Rachel bitch wouldn't
          give'em to me..

                         ERIC
          She's the one who put me and Lisa
          together. Shit. what are we gonna
          do, Mark?

          EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

          BRAD and CHUCK are throwing unfurling TOILET PAPER rolls onto
          the trees in front of someone's middle-class house.

                         BRAD
          Who's place is this, again?

          Nimrod. It's Carlin's quarterback.
          MARK and ERIC pull up in Mark's Mustang convertible.

                         (WHISTLES LOUDLY)
          Hey, dogs! C'mon, we got a mission.

          As she crosses back to her room. There's a KNOCKING on the
          kitchen back door. She frowns, goes to the back door, looks
          through the glass. No one there either. Now she's worried.

          . ' RACHEL
          (calls through the door)
          Boyd? Emilyn?
          She turns when the DOOR HANDLE on the front door JIGGLES
          once. She stops dead. Spins as...
          The BACK DOOR handle starts JIGGLING.
          She backs into the living room and spins as--
          Something starts TAPPING on one of the living room WINDOWS.
          Like a wave moving around her, a WINDOW on the other side
          starts TAPPING.
          RACHEL turns a full circle, scared, surrounded by TAPPING and
          JIGGLING, which grow increasingly loud r.
          She puts her palms against her temples, as if struggling to
          keep something bottled inside:

                         RACHEL
          Oh, god, oh, god. Not now. Stop
          Suddenly all goes silent. She jumps as...
          The PHONE RINGS near her. She scoops up the cordless. Beat.

                         RACHEL
          Hello?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.
          There's a long pause on the other end.

          MALE VOICE (V.0.)

                         (FILTERED)
          What's your favorite scary movie?

          JUMP CUT TO :

          EXT. RACHEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          MARK on a CELL-PHONE. BRAD starts laughing next to him as
          MARK covers the receiver, gestures to ERIC and CHUCK, who
          scurry around Rachel's house.

          RACHEL (V.O.)
          Who is this?

          WITHIN THE HOUSE
          sees a SHADOW run past a window.

          MARK (V.O.)
          who is Wig?

                         RACHEL
          Knock it off. Is this you, Arnie?

          MARK (V.0)
          Ding, ding, ding. Wrgnq, guess again.

                         RACHEL
          What do you want?

          MARK (V.0.)
          (a menacing pause)
          You.
          The JIGGLING and the TAPPING starts up again, loud. The BOYS
          VOICES are heard outside chanting...

                         BULLDOGS
          Rachel! Rachel! Rachel!
          MARK (V.o.)
          Rachel, come out and play now.
          RACHEL grabs a knife from the kitchen, backs into...

                         HER BEDROOM
          where a bandaged WALTER is on the bed, looking alarmed.
          RACHEL keeps backing up, nearing her open closet door.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         RACHEL
          I'm calling the police.
          She hangs up, dials 911, fumbling with the knife.

                         UT TO:

          INT. PIZZA PARLOR - NIGHT

           A beer-and-slice emporium. JESSE'S at a payphone, hearing a
          bus y sianal on RACHEL Is line. He hangs up.

           INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          A horror-movie-moment as RACHEL waits for 911 to pick-up.
          Behind her, a HAND is reaching through the open sash window,
          pulling it up to gain entrance.

          RACHEI.

                         (INTO PHONE)
          I have an emergency. Now, right now!
          Yes, 3366 Elm Street...
          She turns, sees the HAND at the window.

                         RACHEL
          No!
          The WINDOW SMASHES down on the intruder's HAND. There's a
          muffled YELL outside and the HAND is extracted.

          EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT

          Headlights light up MARK's face as BOYD and EMILYN's beat-up
          STATION WAGON approaches the house.
          MARK whistles loudly.
          And takes off, joined by ERIC, clutching his injured hand.

          â€¢ SE - NIGHT
           RACHEL, still stunned by what just happened. The cordless in
          her hand speaks:

           911 OPERATOR (V.O. )
           Hello? Hello, :Ma'am, you still there?
          RACHEL slowly moves to tier bedroom doorway. BOYD comes in
          the front door.

                         RACHEL

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Yes. It's okay. Things are fine.
          She hangs up as a clueless BOYD takes in her freaked-out
          appearance.

                         BOYD
          What's wrong?

                         RACHEL
          Nothing.
          She retreats into her bedroom, looks at the Window. The
          PHONE RINGS in her hand. She answers.

          MARK (V.0.)
          Don't go tellin' stories about my
          Eric.
          Click and the line goes dead. She hangs up. The PHONE RINGS
          again. She doesn't answer.

          THE LIVING ROOM
          The PHONE RINGS on another extension. EMI, swers.

                         EMILYN
          Hello... just a second. Rachel?

                         RACHEL
          curled on her bed with WALTER, calls out:

                         RACHEL
          I'm not here.

          INT. PIZZA KING - NIGHT

          JESSE at the payphone, sipping a Royal Crown Cola.

                         JESSE
          Okay. Thank you, then.
          He hangs up. Checks his watch. Waits.

          EXT. SCHOOL ENTRANCE - DAY

          A SCREAMING DEVIL fills the frame.
          The bed of a speeding PICK-UP TRUCK is jammed with kneeling
          TEENAGE BOYS wearing children's Halloween masks. They're
          screaming bloody murder as they fire RAW EGGS at...
          The BERGEN STUDENTS gathered at the entrance.
          The PICK-UP speeds off as STUDENTS recover, straightening up
          from their ducking positions. MARK and his cohorts go
          running after the truck.

                         TRACY
          Carlin creeps!
          At Freak Hall, ARNIE rises, wipes egg yolk from his hair.

                         ARNIE

                         (SLOWLY)
          Hormonally-charged mo,,,ï¿½r 'â€žns. Why do the
          innocent always get hit in a drive-by?
          RACHEL looks up, sees JESSE approaching. Her eyes flare.

                         JESSE
          Hey, what happened to you last night?
          I waited.

                         RACHEL
          You tell me what happened last night.

                         JESSE
          What?
          ON RACHEL and JESSE as she tells him what happened last
          night. He gets more and more agitated.
          TRACY is wearing her glasses as she and MONICA watch JESSE
          from the Patio.

                         TRACY
          What is wrong with this movie:
          does he see in her?

                         MONICA
          Come on Trace, you're caviar, she's
          cheeze whiz. He'll come around. He's
          just letting little Jesse do the
          thinking for big Jesse.
          BACK TO -- A pissed-off JESSE.

                         JESSE
          Okay, don't worry, I'll talk to Mark,
          I'll take care of it

                         RACHEL

                         (FRUSTRATED)
          No, don't... maybe all this isn't such
          a good idea.

                         JESSE
          All what?

                         RACHEL
          I mean, guys like you are supposed to
          date girls like Tracy.

                         JESSE
          I'm picking you up tonight. We're
          gonna have a nice, mellow date.
          RACHEL stands, silent, torn. The BELL RINGS, everybody
          starts filing in.. She moves, he smiles, blocks her way.

                         JESSE
          I'm not going anywhere till you
          say yes.

                         RACHEL
          (looks away, looks back, smiles)
          All right. Okay.
          (he doesn't move a muscle)
          Yes.
          JESSE lets her pass, with a chivalrous after-you sweep of his
          hand, then falls in next to her. RACHEL'S arm is grabbed
          by...

                         S
          May I speak with you a second?

          INT. GUIDANCE OFFICE - DAY

          RACHEL crossing and uncrossing her legs, it's the last place
          she wants to be. She idly plays with the forest SNOW DOME.
          SUE doesn't look so comfortable herself. She's holding a
          stack of index cards.

                         RACHEL
          What are those, tonight's Top-Ten
          list?

                         SUE
          These are just an exercise that will
          let me know how to help you better.

                         RACHEL
          You're wasting your time.

                         SUE
          Just answer true or false to these
          statements.
          (reads the top card)
          "There's a man inside the television
          set who tells me what to do."

                         RACHEL
          False. I don't see the point-

                         SUE
          "Sometimes my thoughts assume the form
          of a giant insect."

                         RACHEL
          This ddesn't make any sense.

                         SUE

          "I can see sounds and hear colors."

                         RACHEL
          False.

                         SUE
          "Large furry animals crawl on my face
          every night while I sleep."

                         RACHEL
          True.

          SUE looks up, surprised.

          I have a dog.
          SUE nods, watches RACHEL closely as she takes her time with
          this one, not reading off a card.

                         SUE
          Sometimes I can move things with my
          thoughts.
          Beat. RACHEL stares at her, a million thoughts racing.
          Another beat.
          The only sound is the clock ticking on SUE's desk. RACHEL
          grabs her backpack and stands.

                         RACHEL

                         FUCK THIS--

                         SUE

                         RACHEL
          --and fuck you. You're not my mother!
          RACHEL turns to go. SUE jumps up, grabs her arm, and...

                         THE S
          on the desk EXP DES, splattering water and white flecks all
          over the desktop. RACHEL looks at it.
          SUE stares at it, her worse fears coming true.
          As RACBZL flies out the door.

          EBT. FOOTBALL PRACTICE - CAY
          WALSH sees JESSE get tackled, then help up the teammate who
          tackled him.

          What was that? 'hat are you, Miss
          Manners? Show me you're a dog, Ryan.
          JESSE looks at the styrofoam cooler on the bench.
          A few of the nearby PLAYERS begin their barking chant.

                         WALSH
          Say what?
          The barking trails off. The other boys are stunned.

                         BRAD
          Oh, shit.

                         JESSE
          Well, I'm not a dog today, Coach,
          I'm a vegetarian.

                         WALSH
          Since when? Don't give me that.
          Show me you're a dog, Ryan.

                         JESSE
          Sorry, Coach. No can do.

                         Â€¢ WALSH
          Your attitude sucks. Hit the showers.
          Get outta my sight.
          JESSE doffs his helmet, jogs to the bench. He douses his
          head with water, sits there, looking angry.

          INT. LOCKER ROOM -

          PLAYERS goof around, snap towels at each other. Clanking
          steel and grunts from the boys at the weight machines.

          LOCKER ROOM SHOWERS
          The mist in a shower, through which are glimpses of a lean
          male figure with rippling stomach muscles. It's JESSE. MARK
          and BRAD enter the showers.

                         BRAD

                         (TO JESSE)
          Yo, lover boy, whatsa matter? Didn't

          straightening a dyke?

                         BRAD
          Twenty, no, thirty.
          They fingertip high-five each other.

          Jess, you score the skank yet?
          JESSE just glares at him, walks away.

                         MARK
          What's with him?

                         BRAD
          Must be that time of the month.

          THE LOCKER ROOM
          JESSE finishes dressing between the lockers. MARK, wearing a
          towel, approaches him.

                         MARK
          Jess, what's the matter?

                         JESSE
          You. What's with the stunt you pulled
          last night?

                         MARK
          What? Papering McCabe's house?
          I asked you if you--

                         JESSE
          What you did at Rachel's.

                         MARK
          what? We were just sendin' her
          a message.
          JESSE slams his locker closed.

                         JESSE
          Tell me, I'll pass it on.

                         MARK
          Look, man. She's getting Eric in all
          kinds a shit. I mean, if he gets
          charged with rape, there goes any

                         CHANCE OF--

                         JESSE
          Screw Eric, he's a big boy. He made
          his own decisions, he's gotta live
          with 'em. And stay away from Rachel,
          or deal with me.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.

                         MARK
          What are you getting bent for? She's
          just a burnout, a slut--
          BANG as JESSE shoves MARK against a locker. MARK shoves him
          back. The rest of the PLAYERS in the background go quiet.

                         JESSE
          (low, intense)
          Don't call her a skank, don't call
          her a slut.

                         MARK
          What's wrong with you?

                         JESSE
          We screw with girls, use them, because
          it makes us feel like big men--

                         MARK
          Get to the bad part.

          ' - JESSE
          I'm tired. I'm tired of all of it.

                         MARK
          What are you talking about? We're
          friends, we're all friends.

                         JESSE
          No. We just grew up together.
          And he walks away. On MARK. Pissed. He sees JESSE left his
          letter jacket behind, hanging on the locker.

          Well, first, I thought I saw the devil

          like they'd had plastic surgery, or the
          bones were moving under their skin.

          I heard about the good work you're
          doing at the high school.
          The PATIENT turns and softly starts thudding his forehead

          I'm just trying to help Rachel. She
          seems very troubled and I'm worried
          about her.

          her. Who was her father, Mrs. Lang?

          I did tell Rachel how I met him. He
          said it was love at first sight.
          I was his waitress. I insisted he try
          the cherry pie, 'cause I'd baked it
          myself. He said, with every bite of
          that pie, he could see our future
          together. By the time he got to the
          crust, he could see what I would look
          like, all old and saggy... and he
          still loved me.
          (her smile fades, then)
          He left me after Rachel was born.
          I never told her because, people
          around here aren't too fond of Carrie
          White, for what she did. I didn't
          want her having to grow up with that.

                         JESSE
          Yes. No. Sort of.
          She laughs.

                         JESSE
          He got two letters back. one was a

          for your support.'

                         RACHEL
          And the other?

                         JESSE
          The other was from Hubert Humphrey.

                         RACHEL
          Who?

          He was the vice-President once.
          He wrote back a three page letter,
          raving about a place called Wally's
          Burger Hut. My dad was knocked-out.

                         RACHEL
          So your dad wrote a book, color me
          impressed.

                         JESSE
          He never wrote it. Or he was going
          to, and then my sister was born, and
          then I was born. And there was this
          car dealership, and it was security.
          So your dad wanted to be a writer.
          How'd his kid end up being this sweaty
          armpit jock?

                         JESSE

                         (BEAT)
          Sometimes when they throw me the ball,
          it feels like time just slows down.
          And I know where to be and how to get
          there. When I have that feeling I
          catch it. Always. Every time.

                         RACHEL
          And you like that.

                         JESSE
          Yeah, I love it. Except. My dad.
          He's got my life all mapped out. He
          wants me to take over the business.

                         RACHEL
          What's wrong with that? Sounds like a
          nice life.

                         JESSE
          Selling used cars is not what I want.
          And, unless I nail that football
          scholarship,' that's what I'll get.

                         (EXHALES)
          Wow. I can't believe I'm telling you
          all this. I've never said any of this
          out loud to anyone before.
          (takes a long look at her)
          Must be great not having to be like
          anyone else.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

                         RACHEL
          It's not so great. Sometimes I wish I
          could just be one of the shiny, happy
          people. Does that surprise you?

                         JESSE
          Everything about you surprises me.
          There's the soft pops of rain hitting the car as it begins to
          drizzle, then it comes down hard.

          WITHIN THE CAR
          RACHEL and JESSE are in front, facing each other, leaning
          against the doors as rain streams against the windows.

                         RACHEL

                         (SITS FORWARD)
          I used to know this guy, could suck a
          strand of spaghetti through his mouth
          and out his nose. He called it Brain
          Flossing.
          JESSE smiles.

                         RACHEL
          He had a talent. You. You got
          football. It'll get you outta this
          place. You can make your own path
          after that. Write your own book.

                         JESSE
          Yeah? Want to come with me?
          She smiles. He leans forward. And she pulls away-, afraid,
          then decides to let him. They kiss. Then she pulls away.

                         JESSE
          What?

                         HEL
          This...
          She indicates the gear shift.

                         HEL
          is poking me right in the ribs.
          JE55E's eyes flicker to the back seat.

                         RACHEL
          Um, I don't know how to say this.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

                         JESSE
          Yeah?

                         RACHEL
          But I've never...

                         JESSE
          Oh.

                         RACHEL
          And, I'd want it to be special. Like
          you ring the doorbell, with flowers
          in your hand.

                         JESSE
          Right. So... what's your favorite
          flower?

                         RACHEL

          RACHEL gives him a quick kiss goodnight.

                         SEE YOU--

          INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          RASE sleeps fitfully, tangled in her sheets.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. THE WOODS - NIGHT

          A massive GOTHIC BED sits incongruously in a clearing.

          RACHEL AND JESSE
          are making love. She's on top, her hands on his chest.
          Their glistening bodies catch the light of a RING OF FLAMES
          bursting around the bed.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

                         RACHEL'S HANDS
          suddenly sink into the flesh of JESSE's chest.
          She SCREAMS as she tries to extract them,. but strips of his
          flesh stick to her like flypaper.
          RACHEL twists violently as her torso melds into his.
          Their bodies fuse, a grotesque apparition with four legs and
          two heads.
          Her mouth presses into his as their faces merge.
          The ring of fire leaps inward, consuming the bed.

          RACHEL sits, lost in thought. JESSE nears. She stands up.

                         JESSE
          So, you're coming to the game, right?

                         RACHEL
          I don't really get football.

                         JESSE
          C'mon. I need you, for good luck.

                         RACHEL
          All right. I'll be there.

                         JESSE
          Good. I have practice today, but I
          can pick you up later, seven thirty?

                         RACHEL
          Sure, go practice. Go be great.
          Live the life you want.

                         JESSE
          What kind of life do you want?

          I don't know. I have a hard time
          picturing it.

                         JESSE
          Well if you can't, I'll do it for you.

                         RACHEL
          What do you mean?

                         JESSE
          I will predict your future.

                         RACHEL
          Uh-huh. Can I get a hint?

                         JESSE
          'm in it.
          ON THE PATIO -- are TRACY, MARK and MONICA, watching the.

                         TRACY
          If he's gonna do it, you know, be seen
          talking in public with someone else,
          he should show some respect.
          (a slow boil)
          He should show me the respect, at
          least, to be seen with someone pretty.
          Someone cool. Someone who counts.
          Amy or you, you know, ate.
          Instead, it's Its. And I feel...

                         MONICA
          Disrespected?

                         TRACY
          That's right. I wish there was
          something I could do to make him come
          to his senses.
          On MARK's face, a slow, insidious grin that seems to spread
          into eternity appears.

                         TRACY
          What?

                         MARK
          Let's nail the bitch. Plan
          a way to screw her like she's
          screwing us.

          RACHEL watches SUE at the door, speaking to her TEACHER.
          SUE points to RACHEL, who looks less than thrilled.

          EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

          A dark smudge is spread on the empty parking space where LISA
          died. No one parks there anymore.
          SUE is escorting RACHEL to her VOLVO.

          RACHEL (V.0.)
          Where are you taking me?

          SUE (V.0.)
          There's something you have to see.

          EXT. THE WOODS - DAY

          A DREAM-LIKE GLIDE past SUE's VOLVO, parked on the roadside,
          and through the trees.

          SUE (V.0.)
          This used to be the school for the
          whole district. Chamberlain High.
          It was closed down in 1976.

          There was a fire here that year.
          The night of the prom. Seventy-three
          people died. A few of us survived.

          INT. THE DESTROYED GYM - DAY

          Dark; full of exposed wires, metal rods and pipes, countless
          empty beer cans. Two mattresses are laid out amid the
          debris.
          SUE stands on a pile of rubble, next to RACHEL. There's a
          haunted look on SUE's face.

          Sounds of horrible SCREAMING.
          Flashes of.KIDS stampeding. Burning. Dying.
          A fire rages behind CARRIE as she steps off a platform, turns
          and looks at us with the face of an avenging angel.

          BACK TO.

          THE DESTROYED GYM,
          present day, as SUE flinches.

                         SUE
          I haven't really been here in over
          twenty years. But it feels like I've
          been back here every day since.

                         RACHEL
          Happy homecoming. Can we go? This
          place is spooky. Gives me the creeps.

                         SUE
          Do you know what happened here?

                         RACHEL
          You just said. A fire.

                         SUE
          What caused it?

                         RACHEL
          They think a boiler blew up, okay?
          Am I gonna be graded on this?

                         SUE
          Come on, you've heard of Carrie White.

          It fell.

                         SUE
          We both saw it.
          RACHEL looks at her, isn't going to talk about this.

                         SUE
          I know everything there is to know
          about Carrie White. She did this.
          It began with what you did, with
          the snow dome. Then it got out
          of control.

                         RACHEL

                         (TURNS)

          It's a genetic recessive trait. The
          male is the carrier, when he combines
          with the right female, the trait
          surfaces in their offspring, usually
          in women. Like King's Disease,
          hemophilia.

                         RACHEL
          What are you saying I have?

                         SUE
          Its a trait, Rachel, you inherited.
          Telekinesis.

                         RACHEL
          With all respect, lady, you're
          seriously bat-shit. I'm walking,
          back to the real world.
          SUE's voice is low, quiet.

                         SUE
          Your mother told me your father was
          Ralph White. Carrie's father.
          It stops RACHEL in her tracks.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

                         RACHEL
          I don't believe you. She never told
          me, why would she tell you?

                         SUE
          You need help--
          Like what? Like they helped you?

                         SUE
          Yes. No.

                         RACHEL
          So then it's Arkham for me?

                         SUE
          No. I can help you, get it under
          control.

                         RACHEL
          You want to know what I'm feeling
          today? `Happy. Happier than I've
          ever been. So I don't want or need
          your help.
          RACHEL runs off. SUE follows, trips on the rubble, falls.

          Hey.
          (no response from Jesse)
          Just wanted to say two things.
          I'm sorry. Maybe I overreacted.

                         JESSE
          Don't play with me.

                         MARK
          I'm not. We've been friends since
          we could both pee standing up. And I
          thought we'd be best friends forever.

                         (BEAT)
          Never thought some girl could come
          between that. Look, I know I'm scum.
          I'm lower than scum, I'm smegma, I'm

          You're not really thinking of pressing
          charges against my son.

          D.A.
          We're doing more than just thinking.

                         WALSH
          I need the boy for the game.

                         STARK
          Robbie, we've known each other a long
          time, since you were a Bulldog.

                         KELTON
          Save it, Lou. Sue Snell told me there
          were other girls--

                         WALSH
          Those kinds of girls know what they're
          getting in to. Eric's a good kid, he
          may be guilty of some youthful

                         TRANSGRESSIONS--

                         KELTON
          Youthful transgressions? A girl
          killed herself.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         73
          The door opens and the town's MAYOR walks in, grey-haired,
          distinguished, with an air of authority.

          D.A.

                         (NODS)
          Mr. Mayor.

                         MAYOR
          Sit, everybody, sit, 'm just
          listening in.
          He leans against the desk, arms folded..

                         STARK

                         (BEAT)
          Okay. Cards on the table. My boy
          isn't going down alone then.

          D.A.
          Go on.

                         STARK
          He hasn't done anything other boys on
          the team haven't done. Eric can even
          get proof of it. Mark Bing, Jesse
          Ryan, Chuck Potter, Brad Winters.

                         (PAUSES)
          Now, there will be college scouts at
          the game Friday. Eric takes a fall,
          I'll make sure they all do. You want
          to be responsible for tarnishing all
          these boys lives?

                         MAYOR
          Well. I think that about sums it up.
          He looks at the D.A., as if to give him his cue.

          D.A.
          Robbie, I just don't think I have
          enough evidence to ruin this boy's
          reputation.

                         KELTON

                         BUT--

          D.A.
          That's it, Robbie. That's all.

                         MAYOR
          Lou, thank you for coming in.
          I'll walk you out.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.
          They all stand and shakes hands.
          KELTON sits; seething as he realizes the fix was in before
          ever entered this room. he
          He looks across at ERIC, sitting, a smug look on his face.

          EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY

          MARK intercepts JESSE as he nears his car.

                         MARK
          Hey, man, I got it. This girl, this
          Rachel, is special to you, huh?

                         JESSE
          Yeah.
          MARK extracts a KEY RING from his jacket, pulls a KEY off.

                         MARK
          The cabin. My folks aren't there.
          Get away from all of us idiots.
          Go have a romantic time.
          JESSE looks at him. MARK tosses the key, JESSE catches it.
          MARK smiles.

                         MARK
          And bring her to my party. I'll show
          you we can be one big, happy family.

          EXT. STREET/TRACY'S BMW - DAY

          TRACY driving with MONICA as they follow a walking RACHEL.
          RACHEL crosses the street.

                         MONICA
          Finally, she's going into the mall.

                         TRACY
          (an evil smile)
          Perfect. We have the homefield
          advantage.

          INT. SHOPPING MALL, DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

          The cosmetics department of an upscale store, mirrors on
          every counter. A SALESwoMAN sprays perfume samples on
          passing shoppers. She pulls up short as she encounters...
          RACHEL wandering by, out-of-place in her street urchin wear.
          The PERFUME WOMAN watches RACHEL pass.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.
          Stopping at a counter, RACHEL takes in the vast array of
          makeup, the models on the displays. She sees a YOUNG COUPLE
          go by, very J. Crew, very much in love.
          She turns to her own visage reflected in several mirrors on
          the counter.

                         RACHEL
          (under her breath)
          You're normal.
          At the end of the counter, the PERFUME WOMAN approaches a
          SALESWOMAN helping MONICA.

                         PERFUME
          Karen, watch the girl in black, make
          sure she doesn't pocket anything.
          MONICA turns around to see...
          RACHEL -- staring at a row of-lipsticks. She's startled

                         BY-

                         SALESWOMAN
          Can I help you?

                         RACHEL
          Uh, just looking.
          The woman gives her a smile of devastating insincerity,
          crosses her arms and just stands there. RACHEL gets her
          drift.
          MONICA walks up behind RA

                         MONICA
          Oh, hi. Karen, this is a friend
          of mine from school.
          The SALESWOMAN nods, moves away.

                         RACHEL
          Thought she was gonna frisk me.

                         MONICA
          She does Step Class with my mom.

                         (SMILES)
          You should see the scars from her
          liposuction.
          RACHEL edges way, checking out the lipsticks, but MONICA
          trails her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.

                         MONICA
          What are you looking for?

                         RACHEL
          Nothing. Just lookin'.

                         MONICA
          Is it perhaps, something to wear on a
          date? Perhaps with a certain jock-
          hunk we all know?

                         RACHEL
          (smiles, nervous, nailed)
          No.

                         MONICA
          You know, Tracy isn't universally
          loved.

                         RACHEL
          There's a shock.

                         MONICA
          Exhibit A. I think she's a Melrose
          Place superbitch.
          RACHEL cracks a hint of a smile.

                         MONICA
          You have great lips.

                         (BEAT)
          No, really. Look, this shade would
          look very kissable on you. Soft.
          MONICA goes to apply the lipstick on her. RACHEL pulls away.

                         MONICA
          Trust me. See, Tracy tried to steal
          Brad from me. Now hold still.
          And RACHEL does.

                         MONICA
          So, he invite you to the game? Just
          nod.
          RACHEL nods.

                         MONICA
          Well, there's a big party after. I
          hope you can go. I know it would mean
          a lot to Jesse if we all got along.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.

                         RACHEL
          Uh-huh.

                         MONICA
          Good. See?
          Checking in a mirror, RACHEL sees she's right.

                         MONICA
          Here, these two would also rock
          on you.
          The SALESWOMAN reappears.

                         SALESWOMAN
          Can I ring those up?

                         RACHEL
          Um, sure. How much are these?

                         SALESWOMAN
          Twenty-two fifty. Each.
          RACHEL sets the lipsticks down. MONICA smiles at the

          SALESWOMAN.

                         MONICA
          Maybe next time. Bye.
          She pulls RACHEL away. As they walk the SALESWOMAN keeps
          looking at RACHEL with distaste.

                         MONICA
          (a conspiratorial smile)
          Here, I kleptoed it for you.
          She slips RACHEL the lipstick.

          INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          RACHEL before the mirror, applying the lipstick. A P.J.
          HARVEY song plays under, slow, insistent, seductive:

          P.J. HARVEY
          She's burst/ dropped off! picked the
          fruit! realize! I'm naked / I'm naked
          too./ So cover rrry body/ dress it fine/
          hide my linen and lace.
          She pulls on a silver, thrift-shop SLIP DRESS, moves a slee ve
          to cover her tattoo.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.
          P.J. HARVEY (cont'd)
          So fruit flower myself inside out/ I'm
          happy and bleeding for you / fruit
          flower myself inside out / I'm tired
          and bleeding for you...
          She slips off her nose stud.

          EXT. RACHEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          JESSE waiting in his car. He looks up --
          RACHEL stands under the porch light in her dress. A lanky
          gangster girl, with. one leg planted on a step like a cocked
          gun. She's bone-chillingly beautiful.
          He gets out, opens the car door for her.

                         JESSE
          What happened to that little thing you
          wear, that, uh...
          He gestures to hib'nose, indicating her stud.

                         RACHEL
          Took it off.

                         JESSE
          Too bad. I like it. It's different.
          RACHEL looks at the car seat. On it are DAISIES.

                         JESSE

                         (SMILES)
          Just, you know, throw'em in the back.

          EXT. A CABIN - NIGHT

          A small cabin in the woods. Fire light in the window.
          JESSE's CAR is parked in t;^.e gravel alongside.

          INT. THE CABIN - NIGHT

          JESSE is stoking a fire in the fireplace. There's a MOOSE
          HEAD TROPHY on the wall. RACHEL's sitting on a bed, draped
          with a chenille spread.

                         JESSE
          It was nice of mark to lend us the
          place. He's really tryin' to make
          peace. Invited .s to his party. But
          we won't go if y;,u,d be uncomfortable.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.
          He moves to the bed.

                         RACHEL
          No. Let's go.

                         JESSE
          Great.
          (looks at her)
          What's wrong?

                         RACHEL
          I feel like.., we're being watched.
          She looks up at the MOOSE HEAD's MARBLE EYES, reflecting
          firelight. JESSE drapes his jacket over the MOOSE HEAD.

                         JESSE
          Sorry, Bullwinkle, lights out.
          (sits on the bed)
          Feel better?

                         RACHEL
          Feel scared.

                         JESSE
          Funny. He too.,
          He leans in to her. She backs away, like a skittish doe.

                         RACHEL
          I'm sorry, I just feel... weird.
          I don't know. Oh, wow, I am really
          losing my mind here.

                         JESSE
          It's okay. Rachel, it's okay. It
          doesn't have to be tonight. Whenever
          you're ready. And, hey, you know
          what, you're the sanest person I know.
          And that's exactly what she needed to hear. She cups the
          back of his neck and pulls his lips to hers. They kiss; a
          deep, healing kiss.

                         HER HAND
          brushes aside one of the straps to her dress,, which slips off
          her shoulder.
          JESSE tenderly runs his hand over her HEART-THORN TATTOO.

          80.

          CLOSEUPS OF RACHEL AND JESSE
          in the bed, making love. Firelight playing over their skin.
          It's beautiful. what we all wanted our first time to be.
          They move slowly, as if all the pain in the world could be
          erased, ï¿½f only they could become one. JESSE watches RACHEL
          Her face open, vulnerable.

          FADE TO BLACK/FADE IN:

                         RACHEL ASLEEP
          seems peaceful, holding on to JESSE like a child, they're
          covered by the chenille spread. Their sweat clings to them
          like the softest of prisons. He's awake, studying her. He
          gently runs his fingertips across her brow.

                         E

                         (SOFTLY)

          off them and across the floor.
          TO FIND a MI on the floor, hidden behind a chair.
          FOLLOW the MICROPHONE CORD to a closed WINDOW where it snakes
          out.
          There's the gaping lens of a VIDEO CAMERA visible in the
          corner of the window. Its RED recording light on.
          DIVE into the black lens, and...

          And the round BLACK PUPIL of WALTER'S EYE.
          He lays on the bed watching'RACHEL sneaking in through her
          window. trying to be mouse quiet. She gets safely inside
          when her bedroom door opens.
          BOYD stands in the doorway. She's busted.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          8l.

                         BOYD
          You were out all night.
          RACHEL nods, defiantly. He walks over to her and, without
          warning, slaps her.

                         BOYD
          You're grounded. No school today.
          You don't move from this room.
          He turns on his heel, walks out. The dog looks as stricken
          as she does.

          A SERIES OF DISSOLVES:
          Of RACHEL in her bedroom, as the day passes.
          The sun moves across the floor as a ghostly RACHEL and her
          dog FADE IN-AND-OUT around the room. She lays in bed,

          FINALLY -- It's nightfall.
          RACHEL slips out her window.

                         SUE
          Rachel needs help. She doesn't
          believe me and I'm afraid for her.
          I want you to tell her who her
          father was.
          Why?

                         SUE
          She'll believe it from your lips.
          Mrs. Lang, I really need your help,
          before it's too late. I can take you
          to her. Will you help me?
          BARBARA slowly nods, yes.

          EXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM, STANDS - NIGHT

          The entire town has showed for this traditional rivalry and
          there's Bulldog paraphernalia galore. RACHEL appears in the
          stands, looking a bit lost. Down front sit MONICA and AMY.
          On the field are TRACY and her fellow CHEERLEADERS.
          MONICA nudges AMY and waves to

                         MONICA
          Rachel, Rach, over here.
          Hey. Grab a seat.
          Looking around, RACHEL sees she's surrounded by Patio People.

                         RACHEL
          Thanks, but...

                         MONICA
          Oh, please, you're.not gonna sit by
          your lonesome. There's plenty of room,
          if Amy;here slides her bubble butt.

                         (DRY)
          Very witty, Ms. Bulimia.
          But she moves over. RACHEL tentatively sits.

          INT. FOOTBALL LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

          JESSE enters, mounds of hair are at his feet. He looks up.
          MARK and most of the BULLDOGS have shaved their heads and are
          working on the last players. They turn to him in unison.
          CHUCK grins, runs his hand over his scalp.

                         CHUCK
          We did it for the big game.

                         MARK
          C'mon, Jess, you're up.
          JESSE stares in horror at how identical they all look now.
          Then he starts to... giggle, then breaks into laughter, turns
          and walks away.

                         A P-ALN
          Man, he'll ruin the whole effect.

          MONICA and RACHEL.

                         MONICA
          No, no, it's an extra point when
          you score the kick after the touchdown.
          A safety is when you get tackled with
          the ball in your own end zone.

                         RACHEL
          Thought that was a bunt.
          What?

                         RACHEL
          I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

                         MONICA
          Okay, listen. Here's what Brad told me
          to say, doesn't matter if something good
          or bad happens, just say "You. gotta be
          fuckin' kiddin' mel" No matter what,
          just say that. It'll sound like you know
          what's going on.

          INT. STADIUM TUNNEL - NIGHT

          JESSE and the team move through a dark tunnel and onto...

          THE FOOTBALL FIELD
          with all the pageantry and sheer rush of a hometown crowd.
          The school band plays like they're going to bust a gut.
          Hysteria and bloodlust fill the air as the crowd starts a
          barking chant.

                         JESSE
          on the sideline bench. He scans the crowd behind him,
          sees.
          A NOTRE DAME SCOUT, wearing a "Fighting Irish jacket, toting
          a clipboard.
          JESSE then spots RACHEL in the stands, gives her a reassuring
          grin. She glances at the SCOUT, smiles back at JESSE.
          TRACY sees them, is none too happy.
          SLOW MOTION -- A whistle sounds as a FOOTBALL is kicked to
          start the game. The BALL spins end over end until...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.
          It's caught by a BULLDOG receiver who starts his return, then
          is popped hard and FUMBLES. An OPPOSING PLAYER leaps onto
          the ball on the muddy quagmire of a field.
          n the stands...

          RACHEL, MONICA, AMY
          (in accidental unison)
          You gotta be fuckin' kiddie' me!
          They turn to each other, burst into laughter.
          MONTAGE -- of the punishing game. Epic warfare with
          grunting, spitting and cursing as LINEMAN butt heads and.
          -- A CARLIN RUNNING BACK steamrolls through the BULLDOGS for
          a touchdown.
          -- RACHEL, MONICA and AMY do their You gotta be fuckin'
          kiddin' me routine.
          JESSE catches a pass, and is immediately slammed hard

          CARLIN PLAYER.
          RACHEL looks like she's been kicked in the gut.

                         RACHEL
          Do they have to hit him that hard?

                         MONICA
          Amy, Rachel's worried about Jesse.

                         AMY
          Don't worry, i always looks worse
          than it really

          TRACY and the other CHEERLEADERS leading a cheer as...
          JESSE glances at the sideline, where the NOTRE DAME FOOTBALL
          SCOUT watches him, writing notes on his clipboard.

          Well... I understand you need to take
          out Mrs. Lang, to do a drug-abuse
          intervention with her daughter. But
          while she's doing well, her condition
          may be fragile.

                         (BEAT)
          In good conscience, I could only
          release her in your custody for
          two hours.

                         0
          Thank you.
          SUE jumps to her feet to leave.

                         DOCTOR
          Hold on. You have a bunch of release
          forms to sign. I'll go get them.
          On SUE, sitting, knowing she-may be running out of time.

          EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT

          The BULLDOGS prove their worth with brutal play as they cream
          the CARLIN QUARTERBACK for a big loss.
          THE FOURTH QUARTER SCOREBOARD -- the BULLDOGS trail 7-3.
          RACHEL sees...
          The Notre Dame FOOTBALL SCOUT writing notes as he watches...
          JESSE cutting across the middle of the field.
          He catches a pass, but two DEFENSIVE BACKS converge on him
          and he gets bone-jarringly plastered.
          JESSE hits the ground with such force his helmet flies off.
          For a moment, it looks like he's been decapitated.

                         RACHEL

          THE HOMETOWN CROWD rises to their feet as...
          JESSE stays down, hurt.

          Oh, no.
          RACHEL strains to see him as the team circles around JESSE.

          FOUR PHOTOGRAPHERS rush along the sideline to snap shots,
          their cameras flashing.
          JESSE sits up, stands, shakes his head to clear it as he jogs
          to the sideline.

                         RACHEL
          Thank, God. He's okay.

          achingly beautiful spiral in SLOW MOTION.
          THE SCOREBOARD CLOCK -- a booming TICK from 0:05 to 0:04.
          JESSE makes a spectacular one-handed catch on the run,
          streaking along the sideline.
          Ahead of him, a monstrous CARLIN LINEBACKER closes in on him
          with murder in his eyes.

          All the PHOTOGRAPHERS on the sideline have their CAM g
          FLASHES flare in unison, without their snapping them!
          The blinded LINEBACKER plows into the SIDELINE PHOTOGRAPHER
          JESSE scores a touchdown.
          And the CROWD goes berserk as the BULLDOGS throw their
          helmets in the air.

          RACHEL stands there, open-mouthed, relieved, but unsure if
          she had anything to do with what just happened.

          JESSE nods, turns to BRAD.

          Brad, can you tell Rachel I'll be
          out soon? Have her wait for me.

          TRACY passes, soggy, muddy, yet still radiating a cool
          confidence in her beauty. She gives RACHEL, a shark's smile.
          BRAD exits the locker room, goes to RACHEL's side.

                         BRAD
          It's gonna be a while, Jess is talkin'
          to the scout, he said for you to go

          of us in for tattoos!
          AMY and the other GIRLS laugh. RACHEL softens, joining in.
          She looks around at everyone at the party, laughing, dancing.
          The shiny, happy people. it feels weird, but here she is.
          She smiles, takes a sip of her drink.
          By the stereo, MARK cranks up the music as CHUCK dances over
          to AMY, pulls her into the dancing CROWD. BRAD grabs MONICA.

                         BRAD
          C'mon, wench, let's dance.
          He pulls MONICA into the crowd, and she gestures for RACHEL
          to join them.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.

                         RACHEL
          No, I'd rather wait for Jesse.

                         MONICA
          Oh, c'mon, Rachel. He'd want you
          to have fun.

                         AMY
          Yeah, c'mon, Rach.
          There's a chorus of "C'mon, Rachel" from the guys and some of
          the other DANCERS join in. An embarrassed RACHEL surrenders,
          sets down her drink and enters the dancing group.

                         MONICA
          All right, girl.
          RACHEL smiles. BRAD starts dancing before RACHEL.
          SLOW MOTION -- CLOSE on RACHEL's face, dancing, beaming. For
          a few moments, everything seems perfect. And she throws her
          head back and laughs.
          MARK dances into the group.

                         MARK
          Hey, Chuckzilla, why don't you
          put on the highlights tape?

                         CHUCK
          You mean tonight's game?
          MARK shares a laugh and a glance with MONICA and B

                         MARK
          Yeah, tonight's game.

                         CHUCK
          Okay. Let's go to the videotape:
          He dances out of the group over to the VCR where he pops out
          a tape and inserts a tape marked "Bulldogs Highlights".
          RACHEL turns around, sees the large screen TV PLAYING images
          of the Bulldogs playing football.

                         RACHEL
          Is that tonight's game?

                         MARK
          No, it's the other game.
          Still dancing, she turns back to the group.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.

                         RACHEL
          What other game?

                         MARK
          The game you were in.
          The others laugh. She smiles, confused.

                         RACHEL
          What?

                         BRAD
          The one you played.

                         MARK
          Yeah, yeah, what was the score?
          Chuckie, pass me the scoreboard,
          I wanna show Rachel how she helped
          Jesse win the game.
          CHUCK pulls the BLACK NOTEBOOK next to the CD's off a shelf,
          pretends he's a quarterback hiking a ball.
          Twenty-four, twenty-six, hut, hut,
          hut.
          He drops back to pass the NOTEBOOK.

                         CHUCK
          Go long, Bradzilla.
          MARK laughs as BRAD circles around RACHEL, twists between
          other dancers. CHUCK tosses the NOTEBOOK over RACHEL and
          BRAD leaps up to catch it.

                         BRAD
          Post-pattern, Mark!
          Ducking around DANCERS, MARK raises his hands for the pass.
          KIDS start to notice their antics and start laughing.
          BRAD passes the book over to MARK who catches it, mimes
          spiking it for a touchdown and does a silly victory dance.
          MONICA laughs and turns to RACHEL, who laughs, even though
          she still looks a bit befuddled.

                         MARK
          Rachel, catch!
          He throws the NOTEBOOK through the air, where it tumbles end
          over end for a few slow beats, then is caught by her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

          BEHIND RACHEL --
           THE TV SET -- keeps playing football highlights, but suddenly
          there's an almost subliminal --
          FLASH of TWO INTERTWINED BODIES.
          RACHEL holds the NOTEBOOK, unsure of what to do with it. The
          boys are a little out of breath, but still grinning and
          dancing.

                         MARK
          Open it. Go 'head, read off the
          scores.

                         BRAD
          Start with Eric.

                         CHUCK
          Yeah, start with poor Eric.
          She opens the book, looks at the pages with a quizzical
          expression. She sees the Bulldog names across the top of the
          page with lists of girls beneath each one. Every girl has a
          number next to her with a total at the bottom.

                         MARK
          What's Eric's score?

                         RACHEL
          Twenty-two?
          RACHEL stops dancing as she spots LISA PARKER's name at the
          bottom of ERIC's column with the number four next to it.

                         MARK
          What's up, Rach? You know someone on
          that list?

                         RACHEL
          (under her breath)
          Lisa.

                         MARK
          Oh, yeah, Lisa, forgot about her.

                         CHUCK
          How many points was she?

                         BRAD
          Four. But maybe he shoulda lost
          those when she offed herself.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.

                         MARK
          Rach, look under Jesses's name, how
          many points you get?

                         MONICA

                         (CHEERLEADING)
          Two, four, six, eight--

                         AMY
          Who do we appreciate!
          RACHEL looks down JESSES's column sees-her name with thirty
          points next to it, then, above hers, sees TRACY with ten.

                         MARK
          No, more than that, remember, we
          thought Rach was a dyke. He got
          extra-points for the conversion.

                         BRAD
          points?
          Try thirty.
          RACHEL stares at the book, stunned, trying to make sense of
          it.

                         MONICA
          Look at her face, this is priceless.
          At the front door, JESSE walks in, TRACY behind him. He
          looks around, hasn't seen what's going on yet. ERIC
          intercepts him, turning JESSE away from the TV.

                         ERIC
          Hey, man, what did the scout say?
          Behind Rte...
          THE TV SET -- between shots of players grunting, tackling
          and smashing into each other, longer and longer segments
          appear of...

          A COUPLE MAKING LOVE --
          from the waist up, with thick scan lines that almost make it
          look surreal. It's obvious that the girl is RACHEL, and the
          boy is JESSE.
          DANCING KIDS notice what's on the TV and start to point and
          laugh at the set. RACHEL is completely unaware of what's
          going on behind her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         9

                         MARK
          See, we didn't think Jess could do i
          so he offered to get evidence, proof
          that he'd scored you.

                         MONICA
          Here comes Jesse's big play!

                         MARK
          Lookie, lookie, Rachel.
          RACHEL realizes people are watching something behind her,
          then laughing at her. She turns and sees...
          The IMAGES of her and JESSE on the TV.
          Her face goes slack with horror.

                         RACHEL
          Oh, God
          MARK leans in to RACHEL, who hasn't noticed JESSE.

                         MARK
          Jess was disappointed with the picture
          quality, but I told him it was better
          than Pam and Tommy Lee's tape.

                         CK
          Rach, was it good for you too?
          Sure looks like it, don't it?

                         MARK
          Why don't we ask Jesse?
          He turns and calls out.

                         MARK (CONT'D)
          Hey, Jesse! Over here!
          JESSE looks over and his eyes meet RACHEL's, but she just
          stares back, horrified. Then he sees the TV set behind her

                         JESSE
          What...
          JESSE pushes his way through the crowd, trying to get to
          RACHEL. TRACY throws an arm around him, kisses his neck.

                         TRACY
          He told me he was thinking of me
          when he fucked you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.
          Seeing MARK laughing, JESSE realizes what's going on.

                         JESSE
          Rachel...
          He tries to shrug off TRACY, but ERIC and CHUCK grab his arms
          and pull him back into the crowd.

                         JESSE
          Rachel!
          MARK pushes RACHEL towards BRAD.

                         MARK
          Rachel! Rachel!
          She tries to get away, but BRAD pushes her into MONICA who
          shoves her to AMY as they join in the chanting.
          Rachel!

                         MONICA
          Rachel!
          Rachel!
          Drowning out JESSE's cries.
          RACHEL's P.Q.V. -- spinning around. A NIGHTMARISH GALLERY of
          dancing, jostling torsos, TWISTED FACES and LAUGHING MOUTHS,
          smirking and pointing at her.

                         INTERCUT WITH:

                         FAST CLOSE-UPS
          of RACHEL and JESSE making love. The assault of music,
          chanting and images crescendo with...
          BRAD grabbing RACHEL's bare arm below her HEART-THORN TATTOO
          forcing her to face the TV screen.

                         BRAD
          Hey, is that a zit on your ass?
          RACHEL has tears streaming down her face for the first time
          since she was four years old.
          She bows her head.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.

          A LAUGHING BRAD
          glances down at RACHEL's arm.
          The THORN VINE around the HEART TATTOO looks bigger, edging
          up her arm.
          He looks away, shares a laugh with MARK, looks back and...

          THE HEART TATTOO
          on RACHEL's upper arm is growing, etched from within, the
          thorn covered vine snaking like a tendril up her arm.

                         BRAD
          Holy shit.
          He releases her.
          RACHEL raises her head, eyes glowing with pain and rage, her
          broken heart turned to stone.,
          The delicate THORN VINE has grown across her chin, cheekbone
          and forehead, swirling around to end on her other cheek.
          A stunned BRAD backs away from her.
          JESSE breaks free of ERIC's grip, slugs CHUCK and pushes his
          way towards RACHEL.
          Her HEART POUNDS at an alarming rate as she slowly turns and
          sees JESSE coming at her, his arms out to take her in his
          embrace.

                         A KNIFE
          on the bar dances and rattles, then...
          A WHIP PAN finds...
          JESSE, as his back arches in pain and he screams. The KNIFE
          embedded in his open palm, nailing his hand to the wall.
          MARK and the other boys stare in shock.

                         MARK
          What the fuck?
          ON JESSE -- as he screams again.
          A CORKSCREW has pierced his other hand, at waist level. The
          SCREW spins around, burrowing into his flesh.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.
          Everyone on that side of the room stops dead, taking in the
          bizarre sight.
          RACHEL straightens up and...
          The kitchen door CLOSES...
          The glass doors to the back yard slide SHUT...
          The front door SLAMS.

                         TRACY

                         (LOOKING AROUND)
          What's going on Mark?
          I dunno.
          The floor starts to shake like a small earthquake. All the
          PARTYGOERS go still, looking around at each other. The room
          is frozen, even though the music keeps pounding.
          MARK looks at RACHEL, her disheveled hair partially obscures
          her features, but her eyes are glowing.

          THE GLASS WINDOWS
          surrounding the room, begin to RATTLE, then CRACK in a spider-
          web pattern. Then...
          THE WINDOWS BURST inward.
          FOLLOW the deadly hail of shards as they cut through the

          CROWD.
          FROM ABOVE -- The outer edge of the CROWD are mowed down as
          if by a machine gun and...
          A WHIP PAN -- Finds a BOY impaled by a large, jagged shard.

                         TWISTED SHADOWS
          are splayed across a wall of KIDS falling to the ground. The
          hard-edged music keeps playing while...
          CHUCK's decapitated head rolls across the floor and onto...
          A plate.
          The BEEFY BOY spins around, clutcning at a shard protruding
          from his neck, his carotid artery spewing blood like a lawn
          sprinkler.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.
          On a GIRL as his blood sprays across her face and...
          The BOY turns, arcing blood across...
          The Jackson Pollock PAINTING, which blends into the multi-
          colored canvas.
          Reeling into the stereo, the BOY scatters CDs everywhere.
          On RACHEL, clothes spattered red, tears streaming down her
          cheeks.
          TRACY straightens up, having been protected by MONICA, who`s
          screaming, her face a lacerated pulp with glass, shards
          sticking out of it like a pincushion.
          Surviving PARTYGOERS panic as they struggle to their feet and
          try to flee, stampeding over each other.
          , TRACY, ERIC and BRAD shove their way through the crowd.

          EXT. MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          As SUE and BAR.BA k leap from the Volvo.. SUE hears the
          screams from within the house, takes in the shattered
          windows.

                         SUE BARBARA
          Oh, not Rachel!
          They race to the door as...

          WITHIN THE HOUSE
          BRAD runs to the front door.
          An IRON FIREPLACE POKER lifts up one end, then flies like a
          javelin towards BRAD's back as...

          DOOR - N
          BARBARA and SUE approach the door when the end of the
          bursts from the center of it, nearly spearing a surprised
          BARBARA in the face as it sticks out about a foot.
          She jerks back, then pushes the door open with an effort.

          WITHIN THE HOUSE --
          They enter and freeze as the door slams shut behind them,
          revealing a dead BRAD speared through the throat, pinned to
          the door.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.
          Oai, my god. Where's Rachel?
          They see JESSE, then RACHEL covered in tattoos.
          A panicked itMY smashes into BARBARA, then runs toward a
          window.
          RACHEL sees AMY and her eyes narrow...
          MUSIC CDs fly off a shelf and...
          Spin through the air at high velocity.
          One of the deadly frisbees buries itself in AMY's back,
          spinning her around. More CDs embed in her stomach, chest
          and throat.
          MARK and ERIC smash their way through the chaos as MARK's
          eyes flash from a collapsing AMY to RACHEL

                         MARK
          God, it'ls her! She's doing it!
          SUE moves towards RACHEL.

                         SUE
          Stop! Stop it!
          RACHEL has her gaze locked on...
          MARK, who realizes he's a dead man. He moves toward a
          shattered window, through which some PEOPLE escape.
          But RACHEL turns her head slightly and...
          A TELEKINETIC PULSE travels across the row of LIQUOR BOTTLES
          at the bar, exploding them one-by-one, spraying alcohol which
          douses SUE.
          A FLAMING LOG erupts from the fireplace...
          Striking the alcohol-drenched BAR, setting a blazing trail
          and lighting the curtains on fire, creating a wall of FLAMES
          before the windows.

                         SUE
          Stop it! You don't want to--
           And RACHEL snaps her head around, launching another LOG from
           the fireplace which strikes SUE in the back, whose alcohol
          drenched clothes catch flames... and she , A.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.
          A screaming SUE pitches forward, rolls on the floor to put
          out the flames, but caly succeeds in lighting another trail
          of liquor which creates a barrier to the backyard windows.
          In the eye of the storm is BARBARA, shaking her head in
          denial, muttering, as her mental state rapidly deteriorates.

                         BARBARA
          No, this isn't happening. It isn't
          happening, isn't happening...
          MARK pulls ERIC by the shirt collar and they careen down...

                         A HALLWAY
          where each of the DOORS ahead of them SLAM SHUT as they
          approach.
          Utter CHAOS, but RACHEL calmly turns into the hallway,
          following MARK, as if in a trance.

                         I

                         MARK
          lowers his shoulder, crashes through a closing door into.

                         A DEN
          where the walls are decorated with deer heads and hunting
          trophies. MARK and ERIC are smashing a standing glass case
          containing pistols and rifles.
          TRACY leans panting against the wall.
          MARK slips a HANDGUN into his belt.

                         TRACY
          Screw that, get the shotguns!
          Shaking, freaked out, they gather weapons.

                         THE HALL
          d ERIC see RACHEL the end of the hall, silhouetted
          from behind. They take off in the other direction, TRACY
          bringing up the re
          Barrelling shoulders first into a door, the boys burst
          through and into...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.

          EXTâ€¢ THE BACK YARD - NIGHT
          Where they almost stumble into the swimming pool.
          Toting their rifles, MARK, ERIC and TRACY turn to find
          RACHEL, at a gunfighter's distance, coming towards them.
          TRACY and BRAD cock their weapons and bring them to their
          shoulders. TRACY slips on her glasses.

                         MARK
          Wait till she's closer.
          TRACY tightens her finger on the trigger.
          RACHEL's eyes narrow and...
          TRACY's glasses shatter into her eyes, spewing blood
          milky fluid.
          Aaaaa...
          She staggers, fires her shotgun into ERIC's groin and he
          lands sitting next to the pool. A dying ERIC stares at his
          shredded lap, then falls over.
          MARK looks at his dead friend.
          Oh, shit.
          .recovers, and swings his aim back at RACHEL. But his
          rifle goes sailing over his head and into the grass twenty
          feet behind him.
          He makes eye-contact with a grim RACHEL advancing toward him,
          and hauls ass.
          RACHEL glances at a coiled GARDEN HOSE and it springs to
          life, slithering through the grass and across the concrete at
          high speed to wrap around MARK's ankle and trip him up.
          He hits the ground hard and rolls over to find the hose
          twisting around his legs and up his waist like a python.

                         HIS HAND
          grasps for the rifle, but falls short as the hose pins his
          other arm to his side, then curls around his windpipe in a
          stranglehold.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.
          His eyes widen as the life is squeezed from him and he sees
          RACHEL standing over him.
          He gropes for the shotgun again... and finally grabs it.
          RACHEL looks at the rifle and it flies from his hold,
          splashing into the pool.
          But she jolts on two...

                         GUNSHOTS
          RACHEL looks down. MARK had pulled the handgun from his belt
          with his pinned hand and fired.
          She's holding her belly, gutshot, staggers and falls into the
          pool, disappearing amid a swirl of blood.
          MARK yanks the hose from his neck as it goes slack. He
          gasps, points the gun into the pool and FIRES until it's
          silent and he's left pulling the trigger on empty chambers.
          He gets his breatking under control, leans over to look into
          the water of the deep end. He Aar on the sound of a
          mechanical whirring, and turns.
          A POOL COVER starts to unfold.
          At that moment...

          RACHEL'S BLOODY ARM
          bursts from the water and grips his neck. MARK grabs her
          forearm as her other arm yanks him into the pool.

                         UNDERWATER --
          As RACHEL drags MARK down, he kicks and pummels her, but she
          holds on. The POOL COVER steadily closes over them, shutting
          out the light from above.
          MARK finally frees himself and lunges for the surface, but
          the POOL COVER blocks his escape.
          He desperately pushes at it, eyes bulging, lungs burning, as
          his feet kick to keep him afloat.

          ON THE SURFACE --
          The POOL COYER closing as RACHEI, hauls herself from the
          water, barely making it out. MARK'S HAND, grabs her leg,
          slides, then clutches at the edge of the pool. His fingers
          slip under as the cover completely shuts.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.
          M RX's head bulges the POOL COVER, then his hands punch
          feebly at it a few times. Then... nothing.

          BARBARA (O.S.)
          Rachel!
          A weakened RACHEL lays by the pool. She seems to be snapping
          out of her trance as she rolls over and sees BARBARA.
          RACHEL shudders and suddenly just looks like a wet, scared
          little girl reaching for her mother.

                         RACHEL
          Mama. Maury?
          BARBARA'S P.O.V. o
          but it's a FOUR-YEAR-OLD RACHEL, pristine, without tattoos.
          BARBARA blinks and her P.O.V. is of a TEN-YEAR-OLD RACHEL,
          reaching for her.
          Mama, please.
          BARBARA blinks and it's now...
          The 17-YEAR-OLD RACHEL, covered in blood and tattoos.
          She looks her daughter in the eyes, backs away in terror.

                         BARBARA
          What are you? You're not my little
          girl. No. The devil's in you.

                         RACHEL

                         (CRYING)
          Don't leave me, mama.
          But her mother disappears into the shadows.

                         RACHEL
          Please, I don't have... anyone.
          She rolls onto her back, looks up at the STARRY NIGHT.

                         RACHEL
          Please, God, let me die...
          And she tightly shuts her eyes.

          DISSOLVE BACK TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.

          THE LIVING ROOM
          A vision of hell -- crimson-stained walls and piled bodies.
          The fire is spreading, licking its way across the burning
          SCOREBOARD NOTEBOOK, and along the floor toward...
          JESSE, in pain, still pinned to the wall. He raises his head
          and starts in fear as...
          o the center of the room, facing him.
          He sees the gunshot wounds in her stomach, then follows her
          gaze to...

          THE TV SET
          with a cracked screen, but still playing the tape of their
          intimate moment at the cabin, with a sleeping RACHEL laying

                         ON JESS
          He looks back at her.

                         JESSE
          Rachel, listen. I swear, d
          know they were taping us. d
          never hurt you.
          She looks at his pleading eyes.

                         JESSE

                         I LOVE--
          The TV SET now has the video footage of...

          INT. THE CABIN - NIGHT

          JESSE looks at RACHEL clinging to him, asleep, peaceful. He
          gently runs his fingers across her brow.

                         JESSE

                         (SOFTLY)
          I love you .
          And oulls her closer.

          HACK TO -- -
          RACHEL staring at the TV. And the VCR rewinds and replays..
          ON TV -- the moment of JESSE saying 'I love you" to her while
          she was asleep.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.
          RACHEL falls to her knees, tears running down her face. She
          turns back to JESSE, amazed.
          A BLAZING CHUNK of ceiling falls near her.

                         JESSE

                         (COUGHS)
          Rachel. Gat out, now. Go.
          And the KNIFE and the CORKSCREW drop away, releasing him.
          He falls to the floor, drags himself over... and takes RACHEL
          in his arms. He cradles her. She whispers and he bends over
          to hear. She whispers again...

                         RACHEL
          .love you.
          JESSE tenderly kisses her lips.
          And all the TATTOOS fade from her face and body
          Love.
          Her face is serene.
          JESSE traces his fingers across her brow, embraces her, the
          flames start to encircle them, just like in RACHEL's
          nightmare.
          JESSE pulls RACHEL over the debris ridden floor toward the
          back windows, but stumbles and goes down. Her eyes flutter
          open.

                         RACHEL
          Leave. Get out
          Instead of leaving her, JESSE hugs RACHEL closer. The sleeve
          of his jacket catches flames. And he accepts his fate.
          RACHEL shuts her eyes, gives one last TELEKINETIC PUSH...

          EXT. THE BACKYARD - NIGHT

          And a BODY is flung out the back window like a rag doll,
          clothes in flames.
          The BODY goes fifteen feet and falls onto the pool cover, its
          weight bowing the cover enough for water to rush over it.

                         BACK T0:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.

          INTâ€¢ THE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          RACHEL on her back, looking up, eyes open, a slight smile on
          her lips.

          SHE SEES --
          The BURNING CEILING collapse, raining death on her.

          EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT

          .is now a burning inferno. A funeral pyre.

          BACK YARD - THE POOL
          At water level. All is quiet, there's only the sounds of the
          crackling fire and faraway sirens of firetrucks. Suddenly --
          JESSE HURTS up on the --

          From miles away -- the LIGHT given off by the BURNING HOUSE
          rises over the treeline.

          A dejected ARNIE and the two uncool BOYS who couldn't get
          into the party, leaning against a van, staring in amazement.

                         ARNIE
          Man, we are missing one killer party.

          FADE TO BLACK:

          A CHURCH TOWER with a BELL overlooks the student dorm

          INT. HALLWAY, STUDENT DORM BUILDING - NIGHT

          MOVING down a. dormitory hall. The room doors feature rock
          posters and "Fighting Irish" stickers and pennants.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          109.

          INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT

          JESSE is slumped over, asleep on a desk layered in textbooks
          and a notebook. An all-night study session.
          His hair is shor., he's wearing a beard. His face is more
          mature, sadder. The beard largely hides some burn scars on
          one side of his face.
          Over the desk is a MIRROR and a "Fighting Irish" pennant.
          The only light comes from his desk lamp.
          He jerks awake with a spasm, glances at a digital clock
          glowing on his desk: 11:S$ A.M.

                         JESSE
          (rubs his eyes)
          Jesus.
          WALTER, Rachel's dog, hops on his lap, licks at.his face.
          The sad-eyed DOG whimpers'and,JESSE scratches him.
          In the distance the CLOCK TOWER BELL can be heard CHIMING
          MIDNIGHT: One, two...
          As JESSE looks down and his eyes widen in surprise:
          Somehow, he's scrawled on the notebook paper on the desk in
          front of him:
          kINg of HELL
          Or, if you only look at the capitalized letters, it reads:
          Around it, the same phrase is written over and over again:
          kINg of HELL kINg of HELL kINg of HELL
          kINg of HELL kINg of HELL kINg of HELL
          kINg of HELL kINg of HELL
          JESSE lowers the dog
          How did...
          Trails off as he stares at the page.
          The CLOCK BELL in the background is still CHIMING: give, six,
          seven and...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          110.
          T h e F R E N C H DOORS fly o behind JESSE. ns.
          It's the wind. The DOG starts barkin

                         JESSE
          (shushes the dog)
          Ssshhhh. Relax, boy.
          He takes a-deep breath, flips the page on the notebook,
          resumes his cram session.
          On the floor, the DOG looks at the open French doors, then
          scurries under the bed.
          JESSE is writing, in the MIRROR above h
          A WOMAN' s FIGURE
          anding in the French doors, her face hidden
          up, sees the WOMAN reflected, spins to watch
          her stop forward into the light.
          It's RACHEL, in hAk slip dress.

                         JESSE

                         (STUNNED)
          Rachel?
          RACHEL smiles. She lifts her arms to him.

                         JESSE
          (with growing joy)
          Rachel.
          He rises, envelops her in his arms, and kisses her.
          He pulls back to take her in.
          T!!s two of thaw are reflected in ANOTHER MIRROR behind the
          r 's door.
          opens her mouth to speak --

          A LARGE SNAKE
          FLIES out and jams itself into JESSE's mouth, throwing him
          back.
          Ho aacs. clutching at the SNAKE as it slithers down his
          throat, and qmIS'3i$ into the desk and mirror, shattering it
          on the --

          INT . DORM ROOM, NOTRE DAME - NIGH a'
          A LOUD SCREAM as JESSE jerks awake at his desk. His heart
          FATIM like it's about to explode from his mouth.
          He looks down at the paper in front of him. Filled only with
          his study notes.
          The dog, WALTER, is awake on the bed, blinking, having been
          stirred by the scream.

                         JOS
          He recovers, runs his hands through his hair. Starts
          reading.
          The DIGITAL CLOCK reads: 11:59 A.M.
          In the distance, the CLOCK BELL begins'chiming midnight: One,
          three...
          JESSE reads, but in his ayes he's waiting for the savant
          chime.
          The BELL CHIMES: Four
          The FRENCH DOORSNinat
          JESSE spins. The wind. Nobody there.
          He turns back to his reading, his heart BEATING WILDLY again.
          Glances up at the mirror. Nothing.
          His HEARTBEATS and the BELL CHIMES get increasingly LQ=
          as,.. .
          He reads, glances up at the mirror, shivers, and it isn't
          in the cold.

          Move, to ANOTHER ANGLE :
          Where his image is MULTIPLIED TO INFINITY in the two mirror!
          Fear is written on his face.
          And we know he'll be looking over his shoulder...
          Until the day he dies.

                         SLOW FADE
