                         FADE IN:

          EXT. FULL MOON - NIGHT (AND CREDITS. ROLL)

          Clouds obscure the starless heavens for a moment, heavy and
          ominous in the black firmament. Then suddenly they clear,
          exposing a full moon streaked with red like a killer's
          face, a stalking moon staring down at man's evil on the
          earth below.
          A HOWL breaks the night, a wolf pursuing its prey perhaps,
          or perhaps something much, much worse. VOICES break the
          perfect stillness.

          JONATHAN (V.0.)
          What was that?

          MISS NINA (V.0.)
          Just a child of night, Jonathan.
          Come, sit here beside me on the
          veranda.

          JONATHAN (V.0.)
          It's chilly out here.

          MISS NINA (V.0.)
          Oh, no, it isn't. It's beautiful. I
          love the night so.

          2 EXT. RANCHO CORVALLIS - NIGHT

          A middling size town lost somewhere in the Southwest, the
          lights of its sixty some thousand residents twinkling like
          so many Christmas lights in the night.

          JONATHAN (V.0.)
          I've never seen you so beautiful
          before, Nina. So pale, so
          luminescent, so
          He suddenly stops. There is a moment. Then:

          MISS NINA (V.0. )
          Yes?

          JONATHAN (V.0.)
          Your lips are so red.

          MISS NINA (V.O.)
          Are they? Would you like to kiss
          them?
          The CAMERA STARTS TO PUSH IN CLOSER AND CLOSER on the town
          as though searching for the source of the voices.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.

          3 EXT. CHARLEY'S STREET - NIGHT

          It's a typical middle class suburban street, full of pre-
          1 World War II houses, the substantial places they built
          then, two and three story homes with attics and basements.,
          porches and detached garages.
          There is the SOUND OF A LONG DRAWN OUT KISS as Jonathan and
          Miss Nina's lips meet. The CAMERA. MOVES DOWN the street,
          still looking for the voices.

          4 EXT. DANDRIGE AND BREWSTER HOUSE - NIGHT


                         V
          The CAMERA PAUSES TO STARE AT the Dandrige house, so dif-
          ferent in look and feel from all the other houses on the
          street. It's huge, almost forboding, its windows dark and
          vacant, its lawn overgrown and weed-infested, a home that
          has obviously been untended for a long time, unlived in and
          uncared for. However the "For Sale" on the lawn has a
          "Sold" sign just beneath it.
          The CAMERA PANS to the Brewster house next door, still
          SEARCHING for those voices. It's in sharp contrast to the
          Dandrige house, newly painted, its lawn neatly shorn, a
          house almost dwarfed in comparison to the Dandrige house,
          but a happy home, its windows lit and smiling out warmly at
          the night.
          The voices seem to be coming from the Brewster house, spe-
          cifically from a dark second-story window that is open to
          the night breeze.

          JONATHAN (V.0.)
          Why are you looking at me so
          strangely, Nina?

          MISS NINA (V.0.)
          Not you, Jonathan. Your neck. Has
          anyone ever told you it was
          beautiful?

           JONATHAN (V.O. )

                          (UNCERTAINLY)
           No.

           MISS NINA (V.0.)
           Come, lay your head on my breast.
           The CAMERA SLOWLY STARTS TO PUSH IN on the second-.story
           window.

                         5 OMITTED

          6 INT. BREWSTER HOUSE - CHARLEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          The CAMERA MOVES THROUGH the window, past the billowing
          drapes to find itself staring at a TV, the flickering
          screen the only light in the room.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         6 CONTINUED:
          One of those terrible AIP/Hammer horror films is on the
          tube, a woman, obviously a vampire, talking to one of those
          vapid juveniles used so much in these types of films, the
          two of them standing on a veranda to some huge, old house.
          The young man rests his head against her breast, incredibly
          enough, unaware that she is bending toward his neck with
          these huge fangs.
          Just as. she is about to sink them into his jugular, a tall,
          saturnine man steps out of the darkness., wearing a rather
          daffy Victorian suit and carrying a stake and mallet in his
          hand. His name is PETER VINCENT.

          PETER (V.0.)
          Stop, you creature of the Night!
          The vampiress leaps to her feet, her hapless, intended
          victim forgotten. She faces Peter with a, hiss, her fangs
          sparkling in the moonlight.

          MISS NINA (V.O.)
          Who are you who interrupts my nightly
          feeding?

          PETER (V.O.)
          (drawing himself up to
          his full height)
          Peter Vincent, vampire killer!
          He rushes her, the stake held high to plunge into her
          breast and the CAMERA TURNS AWAY from the TV as the sounds
          of the movie CROSS FADE with the SOUNDS OF HEAVY BREATHING,
          LIPS MEETING, TONGUES INTERTWINING in the room itself.
          Only the room, a typical teenager's lair, seems devoid of
          life, the bed empty, schoolbooks untouched sitting on the
          desk. The CAMERA BEGINS TO SEARCH the room, looking for
          the source of this new sound, much more interesting than
          the old flick on the tube.
          And then it finds them, CHARLEY BREWSTER and AMY PETERSEN,
          two sixteen-year olds, on the floor to the far side of the
          bed, wedged between the bed and the window. They are both
          as American as their jeans and making out like crazy. They
          twis.t and turn on the floor, Amy alternating between enjoy-
          ing it and fighting Charley off, both of them white hot
          with their mutual need. As he tries to slip his hand under
          her blouse, she catches-a glimpse of the TV.
          The horror movie has faded out to be replaced by the
          interior of a local TV studio, a tacky graveyard set the
          centerpiece, the visage of Peter Vincent, much older now,
          rising out of a papier mache coffin and filling the screen
          as CREDITS END.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         6 CONTINUED: (2)

           PETER (V.0.)
          This is Peter Vincent, bringing you'
          Fright Night Theatre. Tonight's
          journey into horror is "Blood Castle,"
          one of my favorites. And for a very
          good season. I star -in it.
          He does this booming laugh that goes through about ten echo
          chambers as Charley, totally oblivious to the TV, works on
          Amy's bra, trying to get it undone, obviously something she
          doesn't want. She tries to distract him.

                         AMY
          Charley, Peter Vincent's on.

                         CHARLEY
          (fumbling with the bra)
          Forget Peter Vincent.

                         AMY
          But you love him.

                         CHARLEY
          I love you more --
          Behind them, the station break segues into a commercial, a
          bunch of kids singing and dancing joyfully to a Coca-Cola
          commercial. On the floor, Charley finally gets Amy's bra
          undone. That's it for her; she twists away.

                         AMY
          Charley, stop it.
          Be doesn't listen, going for her again, their finger fight-
          ing behind her back, hers trying to get the bra resnapped,
          his trying to keep it undone and get her blouse off at the
          same time. She suddenly pushes him away, really hard this
          time.

                         AMY
          Charley, I said stop it.
          Charley rolls over, leaping to his feet, frustrated as
          hell.

                         CHARLEY
          Jesus, give me a break, Amy. We've
          been going together almost a year and
          all I hear is "Charley, stop it!"'
          They stare at each other angrily, both of them breathing
          hard, their young hormones roiling inside them. Then they
          look away, not wanting to see the other's anger, staring at
          the TV for lack of any better place to look.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED: (3)
          The horror movie is on again, Peter Vincent and Jonathan
          now carrying a coffin across a fog swept cemetery.
          Charley looks back at Amy, his features softening.

                         CHARLEY
          I'm sorry, Amy.
          She rises, both of them standing by the open window,
          staring at each other.

                         AMY
          Me, too.
          (she puts a hand out,
          touching his arm)
          I'm just scared, that's all.
          He nods understandingly, touched by her honesty and inno-
          cence, his basic decency winning out over his lust. Sud-
          denly she steps into his arms, kissing him as she never has
          before. She breaks, staring up into his face nervously.

                         AMY

                         (SOFTLY)
          Let's get into bed.:.

                         CHARLEY
          (staring at her, stunned)
          You mean it?
          She nods, stepping into his arms again, kissing him like
          he's never been kissed before, the two of them slowly turn-
          ing, Charley seeing the TV first with its grave digger
          scene, then the wall, and finally out the window over Amy's
          shoulder.
          And he freezes. There, below in the side yard, he sees two
          shadowy figures carrying what looks very much like a coffin
          toward the storm doors to the Dandrige house next door.
          His mouth drops open as Amyâ€¢slips out of his arms and onto
          the bed, completely unaware of what he's seeing. She
          starts to take off her blouse, Charley no longer looking at
          her, his gaze glued to the weird scene he's seeing out his
          window.
          As her blouse comes off, she lays back in the bed, looking
          up at him, waiting for him to join her.

                         AMY
          Charley, I'm ready.
          He ignores her, grabbing his binoculars from his desk,
          whipping.them to his eyes and focusing in-on-the figures
          below.

          They're too dark to make out clearly, but they are JERRY
          DANDRIGE and BILLY COLE. An errant beam of moonlight hits
          the large, oblong box, and Charley gasps. It's a beautiful
          piece of work, huge, ornate, obviously incredibly old, and
          bound in brass.
          Amy stares at Charley with rising confusion and irritation.

                         AMY
          Charley, I said I'm ready.

                         CHARLEY
          (still glued to his

                         BINOCULARS)
          Amy, you're not going to believe this,
          but there are two guys in the yard
          below. And I think they're carrying a
          coffin.

                         AMY
          (glancing at the TV and
          seeing the very same scene)
          Sure, and they're on the moors,
          right.

                         CHARLEY
          Amy, I'm serious.

                         AMY
          So am I. Do you want to make love or
          not?
          Charley is still peering through the binoculars, the two
          figures below having gotten the storm doors open and now
          carrying the coffin into the basement of the house next
          door.

                         CHARLEY
          Amy, quick, come-here, you've got to
          see this.
          All he hears is his bedroom door slamming shut. He whirls
          to find Amy gone. Tossing the binoculars on the bed,, he
          dives after her.

                         CHARLEY

          Charley hurries down the stairs after her.

                         CHARLEY
          Okay, maybe it wasn't a coffin, but I
          did see two guys carrying something
          into that house --

          I don't understand you. First you
          want to make love, then you don't --
          They reach the bottom of the stairs only to have a voice
          from the living room stop them.

          JUDY (O.S.)
          Amy, Charley, what's wrong?
          They stop, turning to stare through the doorway at
          Charley's mom, JUDY BREWSTER, sitting in the living room,
          watching the ten o'clock news on the downstairs TV. She's
          a young forty, pleasant looking and warm.

                         T I
          Amy steps into the living room, Charley following, the
          two of them trying to pull themselves together so
          Charley's mother won't notice what they've been doing
          upstairs.

          No, Mom, nothing like that.

          Well, there's nothing wrong with
          that.

          zine in her lap)
          Right here it says the divorce rate
          is 76% higher among couples who
          don't argue before marriage.

          Mom, we're in high school.

          Oh, yes, that's right. Well it
          never hurts to-plan ahead.

           Good night, Charley.

          Yeah, goodnight.
          But he's no longer listening; he's moving toward the window
          that stares out at the house next door. There are lights
          on in the first floor.now. Behind him Amy turns back to
          his mother.

          Good night, Amy. And thanks for
          helping Charley.

          Anytime. See you tomorrow, Charley.
          Be hardly hears her, staring out the window. Miffed again,
          Amy turns and stomps out of the room, the front DOOR heard
          SLAMMING behind her a moment later.

          Kids are flooding out-of the classrooms, the BELL having
          just RUNG. Charley comes out of one of them, holding a
          test paper and looking none too happy about it.

          The bastard. Why didn't he tell us he
          was going to spring a pop quiz?
          Another kid comes out right behind him, holding a test
          paper with- a big A+ on it. Eis :name is EVIL ED THOMPSON
          and he's tall and thin with a terrible complexion and a
          personality to match.

                         EVIL ED
          That's the point to a pop quiz,
          Brewster. To surprise you.
          Charley glances up at that moment to see Amy walking by,
          her head held high, and looking in every direction but his.

                         CHARLEY
          Hey, Amy --
          She keeps right on going, disappearing into the crowd.
          Evil Ed throws a look at Charley and cackles.

                         EVIL ED
          What's wrong? She finally found out
          what you're really like?

                         CHARLEY
          Buzz off, Evil.

                         EVIL ED
          Call me anything you want. Only
          you're the one failing Algebra, not
          me.
          With another high pitched laugh, he walks off, leaving
          Charley staring after Amy miserably.

          Charley pulls his red beater '68 Mustang into the driveway.
          He gets out carrying his schoolbooks and heads for the
          front door. Just as he bends down to pick up the evening
          paper on the walk, a cab pulls up and a YOUNG WOMAN gets
          out.
          Charley stops cold; she is definitely one of the most spec-
          tacular girls he's ever seen, obviously sexy, cheap around
          the edges, but no less spectacular for it. She looks at
          him like a little girl lost.

                         GIRL

          No, next door.
          She nods her head in thanks and walks toward the next door
          house, the one. where he saw the two men carrying what
          looked to be a coffin into the basement. It's a three
          story house like Charley's but there any similarity ends.
          The Brewster house is newly painted and well lived in; the
          Dandrige house has long-been abandoned, the lawn overgrown,
          paint flecking from its side, the entire--place rundown and
          forlorn.
          Charley watches the girl disappear into the Dandrige house,
          whistling appreciatively under his breath. He turns for
          his own front door.

          11 INT. BREWSTER HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

          Charley enters the kitchen to find his mother preparing
          dinner. He hands her the evening paper.

          .Thanks.
          Charley stops by the kitchen sink, staring out at the
          Dandrige house. as his mother goes back to fixing dinner.

          No, but I did hear he's got a live-in

          He's hard at work at his desk, really into his Algebra,
          when over his shoulder a light comes on behind the drawn
          shade of the bedroom window of the house next door. It is
          directly on a sightline with his own room, but he doesn't
          see it, staring intently at his books.
          Suddenly a WOMAN'S SCREAM, high-=pitched and terrified,
          shatters the night. Charley whirls, sending his books
          crashing to the floor, staring out his window at the lit
          window in-the house next.door. The light snaps out, dark-
          ness blanking the entire wall of the Dandrige house. '
          Charley just stares at it, trying to repress a shiver, all
          thoughts of studying Algebra suddenly gone.

          Kids mill about, nearby video game machines going full
          blast, a TV playing the "Young and the Restless" on the
          counter.
          Charley sits at one of the tables, almost falling asleep
          face down in his cheeseburger and fries as he tries to
          study. Suddenly Amy slips in beside.him.

          afternoon before on the screen. He is suddenly no longer

          house has changed although it's hard to say exactly how.
          It just seems worse than before, more abandoned, more-hulk-

          17 INT. CHARLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Charley has the house next door staked out. He sits in a
          chair before his window, all the lights off in his room,
          only the flickering TV to keep him company. It's Peter
          Vincent on Fright Night, another one of his films on, this
          time the volume turned off. Charley holds his binoculars
          in his hand, staring at the dark window of the house next
          door, waiting.

          18 ZNT. CHARLEY'S ROOM - MUCH LATER THAT NIGHT
          The TV is just flickering snow now, the channel having
          signed off hours before. Charley still sits in front of
          his window, but he's sound asleep, breathing deeply, lost
          in his dreams. Soft, sensual MUSIC snakes through his open
          window, enveloping him slowly and dragging him awake.
          Groggily he opens his eyes to find himself staring into the
          lit window of the bedroom next door. He sits up with a
          start.
          There is no drawn shade now. Be can see clearly into the
          room and a beautiful teenage girl with long blonde hair
          stands there, framed in the window, slowly taking her
          blouse off. Charley rubs his eyes., hardly able to believe
          what he's seeing. As he watches she drops the blouse to
          the floor and stands there, bare breasted. Charley gulps,
          fumbling for his binoculars.
          He gets them to his eyes just as Jerry Dandrige steps out
          of the shadows behind the girl, gliding across the room
          toward her with incredible grace. To Charley the whole
          thing has.a dreamlike quality, Jerry more an impression
          than a reality. He's thirty maybe, almost beautiful with
          alabaster skin and chestnut hair. He stops behind the
          girl, sweeping her hair back, exposing her tender, young
          neck. He slowly leans down as though to kiss her.
          As Charley watches through his binoculars, unable to tear
          his eyes away, Jerry Dandrige's upper lip slowly begins to
          pull back,. revealing just the hint of fangs, long, razor
          sharp, and sparkling pearly white in the moonlight.
          Suddenly, Jerry Dandrige stops, the fangs poised an inch
          above the girl's throat. He slowly raises his head, star-
          ing out the window across the side yard and into Charley's
          bedroom.

          the deeper darkness of his room, his hand instinctively
          reaching up to-protect his own throat.
          Jerry Dandrigeâ€¢slowly reaches up and pulls down the shade,
          cutting off all view into the room.
          Charley stands there for a moment, unable to believe what
          he just saw. The binoculars slip from his hand, crashing
          to the floor, and. he whirls, racing out of the room.

          19 INT. HIS MOTHER'S ROOM - NIGHT

          He bursts through the door to find his mother sound asleep
          in bed. He grabs her, shaking her awake.

          house just in time to see Billy Cole walking away from a
          shiny new black Cherokee Jeep, its back door left open.
          Charley whirls and dashes out of the room, leaving his
          mother staring after him.

          Charley slips out his back door and through. the darkness

          .There, among a clump of bushes, he crouches down, watching
          the black Jeep. The rear door is open as though to receive
          some burden, the yard empty, Billy Cole no longer'there.
          Suddenly the back door to the Dandrige house opens again
          and Billy comes out carrying a large bundle in a plastic
          trash bag over his shoulder. 'Charley's mouth falls open as
          he realizes the bundle could'easily be a woman's dead body.
          Billy dumps it in the back of the Jeep and slams the door,
          crossing. in front of the vehicle for the driver's door.
          Suddenly there is a terrific WHOOSH'through the air over
          Charley's head, the moonlight momentarily blotted out, the
          BEATING OF LARGE WINGS above causing the bushes around him
          to bend and sway. It's almost as though a huge bird, a bat
          perhaps, just swooped over his head from the top floor of-
          the Dandrige house. And then silence returns.
          Charley lifts his head, peering about in the darkness just
          in time to see a shape, more a shadow than a man, step out
          of the darkness no more than ten feet away. It's Jerry
          Dandrige.
          He glides toward the Jeep, tossing Billy a woman's purse.

                         JERRY
          Here, you forgot this.
          Billy one-hands it out of the air, turning back for the
          Jeep. Just then the back door to Charley's house bangs
          open, sending a shaft of light into the darkness. Judy
          Brewster stands there in the doorway, calling to her son.

                         JUDY
          Charley!
          Dandrig.e and Billy Cole freeze, both of them turning to
          look at the back door to the Brewster house, inadvertently
          staring right at the clump of bushes where Charley.is hid
          .ing.
          Dandrige takes a step forward, his eyes probing the dark-
          ness as though he can actually see through the murky black-
          ness right to where Charley hides.
          Terrified, Charley suddenly leaps to his feet and races
          back into his own yard, disappearing through the back door
          with his mother. Billy steps forward as though to follow
          the boy. Jerry puts out a restraining hand, stopping him.

          before the door, staring through the curtain at the dim
          outline of Charley and the Detective standing on the porch.

                         CHARLEY
          In my bedroom. Tonight.
          Evil Ed puts down his brush and pulls a dime store cross
          from his desk. He hands it to-Charley.

                         EVIL ED
          Start with this. Of course, you have
          to have faith for it to work. Then
          get some wolfbane --

                         CHARLEY
          What?

                         EVIL ED
          Forget it. Get some garlic, links of
          the stuff you can wear around your
          neck and hang from your window. If
          he comes for you,, that'll be the
          way. Then, of course, there's holy
          water. But you need a priest to say
          a blessing over it first.
          He goes back to his painting. Charley stares at him.

                         CHARLEY
          That's all?

                         EVIL ED
          'I'm afraid so. Of course, they can
          change into wolves and bats at will
          and I don't know what you do about
          that. But your best protection right
          now is that a vampire can't enter
          your house without being invited by
          the rightful owner first.

                         CHARLEY
          You sure about that?

                         EVIL ED
          Positive.

          Charley steps back to stare at his window, finished at
          last. Be's done the best he can, nailing-it shut, strewing
          it with garlic, his chest of drawers shoved in front of it,
          partially blocking. it.

          The cross Evil Ed gave him sits on his desk. He tests the
          window. It's secure. His mother calls up to him from the
          portico below.

          JUDY (O.S.)
          Charley, come down here, please.
          There's someone I want you to meet.
          He turns and walks out of the room, feeling better now.

          37 â€¢ INT. PORTICO - STAIRWAY - NIGHT

          He bounces down the stairs and turns toward the door to the
          living room.

          38 INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          He walks into the living room to find his mother standing
          there, a drink in her hand.

                         CHARLEY
          Yeah, Mom --

                         JUDY
          Charley, this is.our next door
          neighbor, Jerry Dandrige.
          Charley freezes. Jerry Dandrige sits in the best chair, a
          drink in his hand, smiling at Charley. He's even better
          looking close up, almost blindingly beautiful, too much so
          actually.
          There's something disturbing about it, as though such good
          looks have to cover up an inner putrefaction, some sort of
          hidden, sweet, sickly rot just beneath the perfect pale
          skin.
          He rises, the smile widening as he sees the terror in
          Charley's eyes. He holds his hand out as Judy watches her
          son for his reaction.

                         JERRY
          Hello, Charley.
          Charley just stares at him.

                         JUDY
          Well, shake hands, Charley. There's
          no reason to be rude.
          Charley slowly crosses to Jerry and takes his hand, shaking
          it as one would the hand of a recently disinterred corpse.
          Judy.smiles, pleased with herself.

          (rising and smiling

                         AT JERRY)
          I invited him over for a drink.

                         CHARLEY

          the intensity of her

                         SON'S REACTION)
          Invited him over. Why?
          Charley turns back to stare at Jerry. Jerry smiles, speak-
          ing in a voice that flows like honey, charm and nascent
          sensuality oozing from his every pore.

                         JERRY
          What's wrong, Charley? Afraid I'd
          never come over without being invited
          first? You're quite right. But, of
          course, now that I've been made
          welcome, I'll probably drop by quite
          a bit.
          His voice changes, suddenly charged with double meaning,
          his eyes burning into Charley.

                         JERRY
          In fact, anytime I feel like it.
          (changing tack, turn-
          ing back to Judy)
          With your mother's kind permission,
          of course.

                         JUDY

                         (TOTALLY ENRAPTURED

                         WITH HIM)
          Of course, Jerry. You're welcome
          anytime. It's so nice someone
          interesting has finally moved into
          the neighborhood. It's so dull
          around here. I mean how many nights
          can you play Trivial Pursuit? Right,
          Jerry?

                         JERRY

                          
          Right, Judy.
          Charley watches this scene, backing across the room, terri-
          fied. He suddenly hits an end table, knocking it with a
          crash to the floor. Judy looks at him. He's ghost white.

          Yeah, fine. I've just got to get back
          to my trigonometry, that's. all.

          Nice meeting you, Charley.

          dripping with double

                         ENTENDRE)
          See you soon.
          And unseen by Judy, he looks directly at Charley and winks
          at him. Charley whirls, bolting out of room and pounding
          up the stairway out of sight. Judy turns to Jerry.

                         JUDY
          You know, our town really isn't'as
          boring as I make it sound. For
          instance, there's a dance at the
          church the first Friday of every month.

          Charley-grabs the cross off his desk and nervously fingers

          door. The shade is pulled, but there's a light on behind
          it. It doesn't make Charley any less nervous.

                         DISSOLVE:

          44 EXT...DANDRIGE AND BREWSTER HOUSE - NIGHT

          Both houses sit quietly on the street, wrapped in the dark-
          ness of the night air. An ordinary enough image, two
          houses, sitting there, but there's something disturbing
          about it. After.a few seconds one realizes what it-is:
          the Dandrige house almost looks like it's about to pounce
          on its next door neighbor, the Brewster house.

          45 INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

          of her partially open window, sleeping mask over her eyes.

          Darkness and silence, and nothing else but moonlight spill-
          ing through the window at the far end.

          He sleeps fitfully in his chair, his door locked behind
          him, his window barricaded with his desk.

          48 INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL - NIGHT

          Suddenly the shadowy outline of.what might be a huge bat
          swoops past the window outside followed by the BEATING OF
          MIGHTY WINGS. A second later something is heard landing on
          the roof with a heavy THUD.

          49 INT. CHARLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Charley sits bolt upright in his bed as he hears it, lis-
          tening hard. But now there's nothing but silence. He
          stares up at the ceiling, listening and waiting.
          Then he hears what SOUNDS LIRE FOOTSTEPS walking across the
          roof. And then silence again. Grabbing the cross and
          holding on to it tightly, he walks toward his door.

          50 INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

          He unlocks the door and pokes his head out, looking up and
          down the hall. Nothing. Then he hears it, a NOISE from
          the floor below. It sounds like fingernails scratching-.
          across glass. He tiptoes to the landing, staring down at
          the shadow enshrouded portico below. The NOISE IS LOUDER
          now, spookier, more insistent. Clutching his cross, he
          starts down the stairs.

          51 INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT'

          Jerry Dandrige stands above Judy, staring down at her
          sleeping peacefully in her bed. The window behind him is
          now fully open. He glides across the room past Judy's
          bureau with her wigs sitting on it, past the wall mirror
          without leaving a reflection to mark his passing, and out
          the door with unnatural silence.

          52 INT. HALLWAY -.NIGHT

          Jerry closes the door behind him, giving it a sharp tug
          that slightly dislodges it-from it hinges, wedging it..tight
          against the frame. It's something no man of ordinary
          strength could accomplish that easily. He turns away,
          gliding across the hall toward the open door to Charley's
          bedroom.

          53 INT. STAIRWAY - PORTICO - NIGHT

          Charley stands on the stairs, staring through the doorway
          into the living room. There is nothing but shadows in
          there. And then he sees it, the source of the scratching
          sound.

          A tree branch, caressed by the wind, is slowly.moving back
          and forth across a pane of glass in one of the french doors
          to the patio. Relieved, Charley slips the cross into his
          pants pocket and turns, walking back up the stairs.

          54 INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

          He walks down the hall past his mother's bedroom, hardly
          giving it â€¢ glance as he disappears into his own room.

          55 INT. CHAARLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Be shuts the door softly behind him, locking it, sits,
          turns on the TV, rising again nervously and... turns to
          find himself facing Jerry Dandrige. Be opens his mouth to
          scream. The vampire's hand whips out with blinding speed
          and seizes him by the throat, choking off all sound.

                         JERRY
          Now we wouldn't want to wake your
          mother, would we, Charley?

                         (SMILING)
          Then I'd have to kill her, too.
          Right?
          Charley nods and Jerry flings the boy the length of the
          room with inhuman strength, slamming him into the far
          wail. Charley slips to the floor, all the air knocked
          out of him. Jerry advances on'him as Charley fights to
          get his breath back.

                         - JERRY
          Do you realize the trouble you've
          caused me? Spying on me, almost
          disturbing my sleep this afternoon,
          telling policemen about me
          He reaches down and grabs the boy, jerking him erect, and
          slamming him against the wall again, Charley's legs
          dangling several feet above the floor. Jerry leans in,
          pressing his face close to Charley.

                         JERRY
          You deserve to die, boy
          And he. begins to slowly choke Charley, suddenly stopping,
          staring into the boy's face.

                         JERRY
          Of course, I could give you something
          I've never had... a choice. You

          Judy can be heard RATTLING HER BEDROOM DOOR in its frame,
          trying to get it open. Jerry's head whips back and forth
          between the door to the hall and Charley, the SOUNDS of
          Judy struggling to get her bedroom door open becoming
          louder all the time.
          The door across the hall starts-to give with a groan. With
          a hiss of frustrated fury, the vampire whirls, throws open
          Charley's door, and dashes out into the hail.
          Charley throws off his shock at still being alive and
          plunges after him.

          56 INT. HALL - NIGHT

          Charley skids to a halt in the hall, sees the window at the
          far end is flung open wide, and dashes to it, sticking his
          head out and staring up at the night sky. Suddenly on the
          roof above him, there is the SOUND OF POWERFUL WINGS, beat-
          ing away into the night. air. And then nothing.
          He slowly pulls his head back in and closes the window
          behind him, locking it. He turns to find Judy stumbling
          out to her room at last and looking at him.

                         JUDY
          Charley, what happened?

                         CHARLEY

                         (THINKING FAST)
          I, I just had a nightmare.

                         JUDY

                         (INSTANTLY CONCERNED)
          Oh, no. You know, I had one last
          night. I was at this White Sale and
          there I was, standing at the counter,
          and I reached for my credit cards
          only to realize I was naked as the
          day I was born --
          Suddenly they both hear a dull THUD as if metal is bending,
          .then nothing. Judy stops, turning back toward the closed
          window as Charley peers through the glass, seeing the sha-
          dowy form of Jerry Dandrige slipping out of their garage
          and crossing into the.back yard of his own house.

                         JUDY
          Now what's that?
          She takes a step for the window only to have Charley grab
          her, gently guiding her back toward her bedroom.

                         CHARLEY
          Nothing, Mom. Just the raccoons in the
          garbage again. Why don't you go back
          to sleep. ,

                         JUDY
          But what about your nightmare? Do 
          you want a valium?

          He pushes her through her door into her bedroom, closing
          the door behind her and turning for his own room.

          57 INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Charley closes the door behind him, clicking on the TV
          for company, hardly looking at it as he paces. the room,
          lost in thought. It's Fright Night again, another hor-
          ror film on. It's the last thing he needs to see, and
          he's about to lean over and turn.it off when the PHONE
          suddenly RINGS by his side, raking him jump.
          Be picks it up, but doesn't say anything, just listening
          at the receiver. Suddenly he bears Jerry's sibilant
          whisper.

          JERRY (V.O.)
          I know you're there, Charley, I can
          see you.
          Charley slowly turns, staring out his window. There, in
          the window of the house next door,. stands Jerry Dandrige,
          the phone to his ear, staring at Charley.

          I have faced them inn. all their

          The horror flick comes back up on the screen, a much

          stake and mallet in hand. Charley watches the movie
          with renewed, if not fervent interest, whispering to

          Peter comes out of the studio dressed in his street
          clothes, moping toward his car, taking a cigarette from
          his cigarette case as he goes. Eels in his fifties, tall, 
          saturnine, by nature very theatrical, but at this
          particular moment in time, also very depressed. Charley
          jumps out from hiding and hurries toward him.

                         CHARLEY
          Hey, Mr. Vincent --
          Peter ignores him, continuing to walk-toward his car as.
          Charley falls in beside him.

                         CHARLEY
          Could I talk to you a minute?
          (nothing from Peter)
          Please, Mr. Vincent, it's terribly
          important.
          Peter, abruptly stopped, resigned to the fact that boy is
          not going to let him alone. He whips out a fountain pen.

          No, sir. I was curious about what you
          said last night on TV. You know, about
          believing in vampires.

                         PETER

          That I have been fired because no one
          wants to see vampire killers anymore.
          Or vampires either. Apparently all
          they want are demented madmen running
          around in ski masks hacking up young
           virgins. Now if'you'll excuse me --
          Be starts for his car again, Charley falling in beside him.

          have been higher.,

          In fact I have one living next door.
          Would you help me kill him ?
          That stops Peter cold. He turns and stares at the boy.

          Yeah. Dandrige has got to be stopped.
          Listen. I just taped this.

          See. After he attacked me last night
          he went out and had his dinner.

          No, I- don't have any choice. Somebody
          has to stop him. Hold.on, I need

          He rises and disappears out the door into the hall. Evil
          Ed turns to Amy, truly frightened for the first time. He
          whispers to her.

                         EVIL ED
          What are we going to do? if we don't
          stop him he's actually going to try
          to kill this guy.

                         (REALLY HORRIFIED)

          Charley enters from the hall, carrying another slat of wood
          to be sharpened. Evil Ed and Amy fall silent as he takes

          Peter Vincent for instance.

                         CHARLEY
          I told you, I already tried him.

          crosses would be sacrilegious.

          Won't do either.

          Tell him it'll-be just ordinary tap
          water and all he has to do is take a

                         JERRY
          It seems we won't have to go out
          tonight after all. His friends are
          bringing him over tomorrow night.

          Charley sits in the dark-, a razor sharp wooden stake in one
          hand, a hammer in the other. He's dividing his attention
          between the window and the door. There is a M40CK at the
          door. He raises the stake, ready to defend himself.

          the dim outlines of the three kids in the house next door.
          He smiles; if anybody saw the smile, they'd run screaming
          in the opposite direction.

          The three teenagers, Charley, Evil Ed, and Amy, stand in
          front of the house waiting. Dusk is slowly gathering, the
          shadows lengthening as night closes about them. Charley
          glances nervously at his watch.

          be here.
          Peter's old clunker appears around the corner. Amy is the
          first to see it.

                         AMY
          Here he comes.
          The kids rush the car as Peter pulls up.

          Mr. Vincent, I can't tell you how much
          I appreciate this --
          Peter slowly gets out of the car, stretching to his full
          height. He wears his vampire killer regalia, the Victorian
          suit, and carries a small leather satchel. There is some-
          thing truly majestic about him.. He looks down at Charley,
          laying it on. with a trowel.

          There is a distinct possibility.
          He opens the satchel, withdraws a small crystal vial of
          water, slips it into his jacket pocket, closes the bag, and
          replaces it on the front seat of his car. He locks the car
          and turns back to the kids., straightening his shoulders.

          down the stairs into view, first his elegant shoes, then
          his legs with their fashionable pants, and finally the rest
          of him, all beautifully turned out. His handsome face
          stares down. at them as he makes his entrance. There is

                         JERRY
          Are you sure that's holy water, Mr.
          Vincent?

                         PETER
          (playing it up)
          Positive. I saw Father Scanlon bless
          it down at Saint Mary's myself.
          Jerry takes the vial from his-hand, pulling the stopper,
          and sniffing at it, for the first time nervousness creeping
          into his manner.. Charley sidles up to Amy, whispering in
          her ear as Jerry prepares to drink the water.

                         CHARLEY
          Get ready to run. I'll protect you
          with this.
          He edges a cross out of his pocket, just giving her a
          glimpse of it. He glances up just as Jerry lifts his head
          back and. downs the contents of the vial in one swallow. He
          1 7 7 turns to Peter triumphantly.

                         JERRY
          There, satisfied?

                         PETER
          Totally.

                         (TO CHARLEY)
          Charley, you saw it. Are you
          convinced now that Mr. Dandrige isn't
          a vampire?
          Charley stares at Jerry and the vial, stunned almost into
          speechlessness.

                         CHARLEY
          But, it can't be --

                         PETER
          You just saw it, Charley. You know
          as well as I do that no vampire could
          drink blessed water.

                         CHARLEY
          Then it wasn't blessed!

          Charley suddenly whips the cross out of his packet and
          holds it up.

                         CHARLEY
          If he's not a vampire, then have him
          touch this?
          Jerry stiffens, his face losing its color, but none of the
          others notice. They're all looking askance at Charley.
          Peter steps up to the boy.

                         PETER
          Charley, you've already made a fool
          of yourself once. There's no reason
          to compound the error.

          Yes, Charley, you've already.caused

          Charley sees.Dandrigeâ€¢coiling to . spring, Billy sliding into
          place blocking the doorway to the portico. The tension
          level in the room is suddenly unbearable. Peter, Amy, and
          Evil Ed are aware of it although they don't know the
          reason. Charley slowly edges the cross back into his
          pocket.

                         CHARLEY
          No, no, of course not.,

                         JERRY
          And you're finally-convinced I'm not

          Their eyes lock; a moment passes. Then finally:

                         CHARLEY
          Yes.
          Jerry smiles at him and the tension suddenly flows out of
          the room. Billy even smiles. Jerry steps forward, usher-
          ing them all toward the portico.

          Not at all, Mr. Dandrige. Glad to be

          Jerry ignores Charley, turning to Amy and Evil Ed as Peter
          steps back, reaching into his coat pocket for his cigarette
          case.

                         JERRY

          Her face is beginning to stiffen, her eyes turning blank.
          Charley looks at her in sudden alarm, remembering the girl
          he saw through the window that night.
          He grabs Amy by the arm, tugging. her toward the door.

          opens his cigarette case, takes out a smoke, about to tamp
          it down on a thumbnail when he glances at the mirror on the
          inside of the-lid. He sees Amy, Evil Ed, and Charley
          grouped around where Jerry Dandrige should be standing, but
          he's not there. It's as though the kids are talking to

          You know, in such things as horror
          movies and the occult.
          Peter's head jerks up and he looks at the doorway. Now he
          sees Jerry standing there, talking to the kids. Peter

                         4
          looks back down at the mirror again. No Jerry. His face
          goes chalk white, his mouth gasps for air, and he drops the
          case from his palsied hands. It smashes to the hardwood
          floor with a crash. Everyone turns and looks at him.

                         JERRY
          Something wrong, Mr. Vincent?
          Peter hurriedly scoops up the case, trying to hide his
          shaking hands and keep the tremor out of his voice.

                         PETER
          No, no, just my clumsiness. Come
          along, we must be going. Thank you

          watches, puzzled by his sudden change in attitude.

          hardly able to fit them into the lock with his trembling
          hands.

                         CHARLEY

          They're- not shaking.

          the wheel, slamming the door behind them. Charley leans
          down, speaking through the partially open window.

          Forget it. You may be chickenshit,
          but I'm not.
          He disappears down the alley into the darkness. Amy and
          Charley stare after him. She turns to Charley.

                         AMY
          What do we ' do?..

                         CHARLEY Â€¢
          Let him go. No vampire's gonna want
          hint anyway.. Probably give him blood
          poisoning.
          They're about to turn away when a blood curdling SCREAM
          ECHOES out of the darkness of the alleyway. It's Evil Ed.
          Charley and Amy dash headlong into the alley after him.

          83 INT. ALLEY - NIGHT

          They speed through the darkness, skidding to a halt on the
          shadow slick pavement, looking around.

                         CHARLEY
          Where is he?
          Amy spots him laying crumpled against a wall.

                         AMY
          Over here.

                         I
          They dash to him, kneeling by his side. Evil Ed's eyes are
          closed, his breathing shallow. Charley tries to shake him
          awake.

                         CHARLEY
          Ed, Ed, are you all right?
          Nothing from Evil Ed. Charley looks at Amy.

                         CHARLEY
          Jesus, I warned him --
          Evil Ed's eyes suddenly snap open, staring up wildly at
          Charley.

                         EVIL ED
          He got me, Charley. He bit me.
          (grabbing him by

                         THE LAPELS)
          You know what you're gonna have
          to do, don't you?
          (as Charley shakes his
          head, really scared)
          Kill me, Charley. Kill me before I
          turn into a vampire and --
          He suddenly heaves himself.at Charley, his mouth opening,
          going for his throat as Charley jerks back, terrified.

                         EVIL ED
          Give you a hickey!
          He suddenly lets Charley go, rolling on the pavement and
          laughing like a maniac, perfectly all tight. Charley
          springs to his feet, furious with him.

                         CHARLEY
          You asshole, you fucking asshole!
          Evil Ed rolls on the ground in hysterics, pointing at him,
          and laughing loudly.

                         83 CONTINUED:

                         EVIL ED
          Ha, hah, really fooled you.
          (climbing to his
          feet and dusting

                         HIMSELF OFF)
          You really believed me, you poor
          dope!

                         CHARLEY
          (flushed with anger)
          You'll get yours someday, Evil.
          He grabs Amy's hand and walks back down the alley toward
          the street and the lights. Evil Ed yells after him.

                         EVIL ED

                         (MOCKINGLY)
          Yeah., when? When I'm bit by a
          vampire? There are no such things as
          vampires, you fruit cake!
          Still chuckling to himself, he turns in the opposite direc-
          tion and-disappears down the alleyway into the darkness.
          A moment passes; nothing but silence.
          Then Jerry Dandrige steps out from a shadowy wall where it
          would be impossible for any mortal to have concealed
          himself. It's almost as though he materializes out of the
          night. He stares after Charley and Amy and then slowly
          turns to stare in the opposite direction after Evil Ed.
          He slowly walks in that direction.

          83A EXT. FARTHER DOWN THE ALLEY -.NIGHT

          Evil Ed walks along, feeling safe and secure. And then he
          hears it, FOOTSTEPS behind him, coming through the dark
          slowly toward him. He turns and looks back.

                         EVIL ED
          Charley, Amy, that you?
          He hears nothing but those FOOTSTEPS GETTING CLOSER.and
          CLOSER. The fear starts to work at him, twisting up his
          gut and making his forehead sheen with sweat. He steps
          forward, yelling out with false bravery.

                         EVIL ED
          If that's. you, it isn't working. I'm
          not scared!
          And then Jerry emerges out of the shadows, smiling at him.
          With a scream, Evil Ed turns and runs.

           83B EXT. FURTHER DOWN THE ALLEY - NIGHT

          Evil Ed runs like he's never run before,â€¢pounding through
          the dark, smashing into traffic cans and falling to the
          ground, leaping to-his feet, ignoring his skinned hands and
          bruised knees, running for his life and knowing it.

          83C EXT. DEAD END NIGHT

          He suddenly skids to a halt, facing a brick wall. He
          whirls, his breath-coming in ragged gasps now, peering down
          the alleyway into the dark, listening to those FOOTSTEPS
          getting closer and closer. He slowly backs away until he
          has no further to go his back against the brick wall, on
          the verge of hysteria.

                         EVIL ED
          No, no --
          The FOOTSTEPS SUDDENLY STOP. Nothing but silence. The
          seconds tick past. He takes a step away from the wall,
          peering into the darkness with something like hope, preying
          that maybe, just maybe, Dandrige has given up.
          A voice suddenly whispers in his ear, no more than an inch
          away.

                         JERRY
          Hello, .Edward.
          Evil Ed turns with a scream to find Jerry standing right
          next to him. Almost insane with fear now, slobbering like
          a wounded animal, he backs away from the shadowy figure,
          hitting the corner and sliding to the cold pavement, almost
          curled up in a fetal ball, tears streaming from his eyes.
          Dandrige walks over to him, staring down with something
          like pity in his eyes.

                         JERRY
          You have nothing to fear from me.
          (in a voice like honey)
          I understand what it's like, being
          different. Only they won't make fun
          of you anymore or beat you up. I'll
          see to that. All you have to do is
          take my hand.
          Evil Ed slowly looks up at him through his tear-stained
          eyes to see Jerry staring-down at him, his. hand outstretch-
          ed to.him, a slight smile on his face, gentle, seductive,
          beguiling.

                         JERRY
          Here, Edward, take my hand.
          Evil Ed looks down at the hand outstretched to him.

          It's beautiful, perfectly shaped with thin, elegant
          fingers, almost womanly, the nails impossibly long,
          perfectly shapped, tapering to five gleaming, razor sharp
          points.
          Evil Ed slowly reaches out and-takes the vampire's hand.
          Jerry smiles down at him and slowly leans down, lifting him
          up into the last embrace Edward Thompson will ever know.

          84 EXT. STREET - NIGHT

          Charley and Amy walk rapidly along a street, heading toward
          Amy's home. He casts a glance at her.

                         CHARLEY
          How much further?

                         AMY
          About ten minutes --
          A DEATH RATTLE, long and-high-pitched, suddenly comes to
          them, ECHOING through the city streets, down alleyways and
          across apartment buildings, faint yet filled with so much
          terror it stops them in their tracks and leaves them
          staring fearfully about at the shadows.

                         CHARLEY
          What was that?

                         AMY
          Evil Ed messing around.

                         (SHOUTING)
          Not funny, Evil!
          Her voice bounces off the walls down the street and then
          dies, leaving them staring at the darkness and the shadows,
          fearful. Amy tries to act brave, turning to Charley.

                         AMY

                         C'MON --
          They start down the street again, Charley glancing
          nervously over his. shoulder in the direction of Evil Ed's
          scream.

                         CHARLEY
          Amy, what if Evil really was in
          trouble?

                         AMY
          Oh, come on, Charley, don't let him
          suck you in again --
          All the street lights suddenly go out, plunging them into
          almost total blackness.

          They whirl, looking back down the now totally dark street,
          slowly backing away from the darkness.

          What else could it be -- 7
          Charley stops, grabbing her, and nods to a light pole oppo-
          site them. She follows his gaze to see a power box on the
          pole, its front ripped open, the wires inside shredded.-
          Before they can even gasp at the sight, they hear the SOUND

                         {
          OF HUGE WINGS beating overhead.. A huge shadow of a bat
          flies across the building wall opposite them. That's all
          it takes; they whirl, dashing down the street.

          87 EXT. ANOTHER STREET - NIGHT

          They come-racing down a street, under a bridge and start
          up the incline toward the ROAR above. They turn onto the
          bridge, starting to.cross it., slowing to a walk, breathing
          hard.

                         CHARLEY
          I think we lost him.

                         AMY
          Yeah.
          (stopping and turning

                         TO CHARLEY)
          Charley, you were right about the
          holy water. We faked it. I'm just 
          sorry I didn't believe you.

                         CHARLEY
          It's all right, Amy.
          He kisses her, takes her hand, and they start walking up
          the bridge.

                         CHARLEY
          We've got it made
          And they freeze.' There, high above them on one of the
          arches of the bridge, so high up no one could possibly get
          there unless they flew, stands Jerry Dandrige, staring down
          at them. With a scream, they whirl, racing off the bridge
          and down the street.

          They suddenly turn the corner only to find they are facing
          Jerry Dandrige, standing on the sidewalk directly in front
          of them, amused by the frozen expressions of horror on
          their faces.

                         CHARLEY-
          Run?
          He grabs Amy's hand, the two of them whirling and dis-
          appearing around the street corner.

          90 EXT. ANOTHER STREET - NIGHT

          They whip around the corner only to skid to a halt. There
          stands. Jerry Dandrige again, smiling at them. He takes a
          step toward them and they whirl, diving down a side street.

          91 EXT. SIDE STREET - CLUE RADIO - NIGHT

          They tear down the street, teeing the Club Radio, a
          fashionable disco, across the street. Its entrance is
          jammed with people trying to get in, all of them dressed to
          the teeth in New Wave and neo-punk.

                         CHARLEY

                         91 CONTINUED:
          Charley dives for it, dragging Amy after him just as Jerry
          appears. around the corner behind them, walking toward then
          with a steady gait, relaxed, in no great hurry, a hunter
          sure of his kill.
          Charley and Amy fight their way through the crowd until
          they reach the front door. A BOUNCER stands there, check-
          ing I.D.s and collecting the cover charge. He hardly looks
          down as Amy and Charley step up.

                         BOUNCER
          Five bucks apiece.
          Charley frantically searches his pockets and comes up with
          change and nothing else. Amy pulls out a ten dollar bill
          and hands it to him.

                         AMY
          I've got it --
          As Charley takes it from her, he glances over her shoulder
          and sees Jerry moving through the crowd toward them. He
          shoves the money at the Bouncer hurriedly.

                         CHARLEY

                         HERE --
          The man takes it and Charley grabs Amy, pulling her toward
          the door, watching over his shoulder as Jerry keeps coming
          closer and closer toward them. Suddenly the Bouncer
          reaches out and collars Charley'.

                         BOUNCER
          Hey, just a sec. How old are you
          two?

                         CHARLEY

          Eighteen.

                         BOUNCER
          Let me see some I.D.
          Charley glances back. Jerry is just an arm's length away
          now. A MAN suddenly shoulders him aside just as he's about
          to grab Charley and Amy.

                         MAN
          Hey, wait you turn.
          Jerry turns and stares at the man. Whatever the man sees
          in Jerry's eyes gives him the,cold sweats and.he backs
          hurriedly away.

          Charley grabs Amy, using the moment to pull her away from
          the door and Jerry. The Bouncer shouts after them, holding
          up the ten spot.

                         BOUNCER
          Hey, what about your.money?
          Charley and Amy come out of the crowd, backing away from
          the door just as Jerry emerges, stepping after them. He's
          only ten feet away now, smiling as he approaches, both kids
          realizing it's hopeless to run at this point. Backing
          away, Charley and Amy cross the mouth of an alley. There's
          the CRASH OF A GARBAGE PAIL and Charley glances down the
          alley to see a dish washer from the club dumping garbage,
          the bright lights of the door into the kitchen shining like
          a beacon in the night.
          Charley grabs Amy's hand and jerks her down the alley after

          that direction.
          At the corner of the dance floor, the cook can be seen ges-

          There is a KNOCK at Peter's locked and barred door. He
          slowly rises from his chair, the cross clenched in his
          hand, staring at it, terrified. The KNOCKING COMES.AGAIN,
          louder this time. He presses his lips to the door, whis-
          pering.

                         PETER
          Who is it?

                         EVIL ED
          There's a vampire out here. Let me
          in.
          Peter slips the cross into his pocket and unlocks the door.
          Be pulls Evil Ed into the room, hurriedly locking and bar-
          ring the door behind him. Evil Ed has changed, and not for
          the better. His skin is more sallow, huge dark circles
          under his eyes, his lips bloodless, his collar pulled up
          tightly around his neck. Peter turns to him.

                         PETER
          What are we going-to do?

                         EVIL ED
          What are you going to do, not me.
          Peter stares at him as Evil Ed slowly reaches up and pulls
          down the collar of his shirt, revealing two small puncture
          marks on his throat. Peter's eyes widen in horror; Evil
          Ed's smile only grows wider.

                         EVIL ED
          I used to admire you, you know that.
          Of course, that was before I found

          the boy in growing terror. Evil. Ed smiles at him, reveal-

          for the door, fumbling to undo the locks and bars with
          trembling fingers. Evil Ed watches, his rictus grin just
          growing wider.

                         EVIL ED
          Peter Vincent, the great vampire
          killer, indeed!
          He throws himself at Peter, grabbing him from behind and
          whirling him about, opening his mouth wide to sink his
          fangs into him. Peter straightens, grabbing the cross from
          his pocket and thrusting it directly into Evil Ed's face,
          slamming it into his forehead between his eyes.
          His skin sizzles and cracks, smoke rising, and Evil Ed
          backs away, bent over screaming in pain, his hands held to
          his face.
          He slowly looks up as Peter watches, frozen in horror.
          Evil Ed drops his hands from his face, revealing a smoking
          sign of the cross branded into his forehead. He stares at
          Peter.

                         EVIL ED
          What have you done to me?
          He turns to look into the wall mirror, but there's no re-
          flection.for him to see. He whirls on Peter, screaming at
          him like the spoiled brat he is.

                         EVIL ED
          What have you done to me?

          stairs. It is at that moment that he catches a glimpse of
          Amy on the dance floor, dancing with Jerry. He hurries
          down the stairs and onto the floor.
          On the dance floor, Amy moves.with Jerry, their bodies
          locked together, slowly falling. into his eyes, dancing
          slower and slower with him until finally she has no will
          left of her own. She is "in love" with him. It is at that
          moment that she bends her head forward, laying it on his
          shoulder, exposing her neck to him, her eyes staring at the
          wall as they revolve around and around, Jerry bending down
          to kiss her neck, his mouth slowly opening. It is at that
          moment Amy sees her reflection in the mirrors mounted
          against one wall;.she is dancing alone. Shocked back to
          her senses, she goes rigid in Jerry's arms, trying to pull
          away from him, screaming as the music and the dancers stop.

                         'AMY
          Charley!
          Across the dance floor, Charley hears her SCREAM and pushes
          his way through the sea of humanity, fighting his way to
          her side where she stands with Jerry, once again caught in
          his eyes, slowly losing her will. Charley grabs Jerry by
          the shoulder, trying to pull him away from Amy.

          Jerry looks down at him, smiling, mocking him as Amy sways
          in his arms, her eyes locked on. his face.

                         JERRY
          What's wrong, Charley? Jealous?
          He grinds his pelvis against.Amy, dry humping her in front
          of Charley. She throws her head back, her mouth opening in
          .something close to ecstasy, her eyes glazed, staring up at
          him with adoration, giving herself to him as she cocks her
          head to one side, exposing her tender young throat.
          Charley goes crazy.

                         CHARLEY
          You filthy son-of-a-bitch -- !
          He swings at him only to have Jerry release Amy, catching
          Charley's fist in the palm of his hand easily. Be stares
          down at the boy, smiling cruelly.

          .JERRY
          You shouldn't lose your temper,
          Charley. It isn't polite.
          He tightens his grip, slowly squeezing Charley's fist. You
          can almost hear the knuckle bones grinding as Charley's
          face'contorts in agony, driving him to his knees before
          Jerry. Charley looks up at him, tears of pain streaming
          down his face.

                         CHARLEY
          (gasping with pain)
          You can't kill me here --

                         JERRY
          I don't want to kill you, Charley. 
          I -want you to bring Peter Vincent to
          my house, just the two of you. That
          is if you ever want to see Amy again.
          He casually releases Charley, letting the boy drop to the
          floor as he disappears with Amy into the swirling mass of
          dancers. Charley leaps to his feet, ignoring the pain in
          his hand and plunges after them.
          Charley breaks free of the swirl near the bar, looking
          everywhere and not seeing either of them. Suddenly he's
          grabbed by a strong, pair of arms. He looks up to find
          himself staring into the face of a huge, black BOUNCER.

          Hey, Donny, this the one?
          Another huge bouncer, the one the cook talked to when
          Charley and Amy sneaked into the club, steps out of the
          whirl staring down at the boy.

          Yeah, its him.

          Charley suddenly sees Jerry and Amy breaking through the
          throng, heading for the entrance. He points to them
          wildly.

                         CHARLEY

          He cuts across the floor on a diagonal to intercept Jerry
          and Amy, the black bouncer dragging Charley after him in a
          steel 'grip. Jerry finally reaches the throng near the
          front door, starting to move through it with Amy when sud-
          denly the two bouncers and Charley block his way. Donny
          jerks Amy out of Jerry's hand, passing her to the black
          bouncer, nodding at her and Charley.

          Jerry steps toward Amy, his face beginning to darken with
          rage, the MUSIC pulsating around them, people swirling by
          on all sides.

                         JERRY
          She's mine --
          Donny puts out his hand, stopping Jerry as the black
          bouncer drag's Charley and Amy toward the front door.

                         DONNY
          You want chicken, man, you. go to some
          other club.
          Jerry snarls, his eyes beginning to glow, his hair slicking
          back slightly, the hint of fangs beginning to protrude over
          his upper lip as rage overtakes him. He raises his right
          hand, holding it out in.front of. the bouncer's face so the
          man can clearly see what is happening. The nails on the
          four fingers pop out, literally elongating several inches
          in front of the man's eyes, growing into razor sharp claws
          that sparkle in the overhead lights.
          The bouncer, terrified, screams for his'companion.

                         'DONNY
          Hey, Leon, get back here!
          Toward the entrance to' the club, Leon releases Charley and
          Amy, hustling back toward his buddy. Charley grabs Amy,'
          pulling her toward the door.

          C'mon, quick --
          But it's. too late already. Donny screams as the talons
          whistle through the air, tearing his throat out in one
          swipe, scattering blood everywhere, blinding several of the
          dancers swirling.by, hitting people drinking at the bar, a
          couple necking in a corner, blood flying everywhere.
          Jerry steps around the corpse as it topples backward over a
          table of coke users, the bouncer's dead eyes staring up at
          them. Leon dashes up, - lunging for Jerry. The vampire's
          hand snaps out, grabbing`him by the throat, squeezing,
          driving those claws deep into the man's neck, holding him
          like a chicken, enjoying a second of his death throes and
          then casually flinging him into the center of the floor,
          bringing the music and all the dancing to a shrieking halt
          as this new group of people stare at another dead body.

          streaming toward the bottleneck of a hallway leading to the
          front door, turning it into a battleground of panicked,

          She slowly takes it and-he raises her up into his arms,
          moving in place to the MUSIC with her, smiling down as she
          stares up at him blindly. He gently pushes her head down
          on his shoulder, exposing her tender young neck.
          And then he slowly bends down, his mouth opening to expose
          those two, razor sharp fangs with their alabaster cast,
          slowly, delicately sliding them beneath her skin.

          like she's having something like a sexual climax, only
          better, much better.
          And just underneath her scream.is this horrid, greedy,
          SUCKING NOISE, Jerry Dandrige, feeding.

                         CUT TO:

          125A EXT. SIDE YARD OF A HOUSE - NIGHT

          Charley walks through the darkness, with cross and stake
          held in his hands, slowly approaching the Dandrige house
          through a side yard across the street.
          The shadows loom up over him, the wind causing the TREE
          BRANCHES to RUSTLE, Charley growing more and more nervous
          with every passing second.

          126 EXT. DANDRIGE HOUSE - NIGHT

          -Charley steps out of the darkness of the trees across the
          street from the Dandrige house, stopping to stare at it.
          The huge, silent, dark.house no longer looks like every
          other house on the block.
          It seems to have assumed a life of its own and turned into
          a hulking, brooding monster, about to leap forward and
          pounce on him.
          Charley grips his stake and hammer, checks the cross stuck
          in his jacket pocket, takes'a deep breath, squares his
          shoulders, and starts the slow walk toward the Dandrige
          house. Through the trees-he moves, into the shadows and
          darkness, across the street, closer and closer,to that
          hulking,, evil house.
          Suddenly a'hand snaps out of the darkness, grabbing him by
          the shoulder.

           "PETER (O . S . )
          Peter Vincent, ready to do battle
          with the undead.
          Charley whirls to find himself staring into Peter Vincent's
          drawn face. He wears his Victorian suit, his whole
          demeanor that of his public persona, the vampire killer.

          The two of them cross the street, heading toward the house
          which now seems to be staring at them, about to charge
          them. Charley glances at Peter.

          eyes are on that malevolent looking house, the house
          looming larger and larger above him as they get closer and
          closer.
          Peter begins to slow, his nerve draining away as the true-
          evilness of the. place begins to eat at him. He finally
          comes to a halt, staring at the house. Charley stops,
          looking. back.

          closer they get. Charley takes a step for the front door.

          The front door slowly swings open on creaking hinges,
          seemingly of its own accord. Peter and Charley turn to
          look at it, a dark gaping hole like an open mouth, ready
          to swallow them.

          with him, his gaze fixed on that gaping mouth of an open
          doorway, mumbling to himself as he goes.

           Nothing moves, not even a shadow. Charley nods up the

          coming from the other end of the hallway. He looks up,

          there, the long wooden splinter buried in his heart.

                         WILDLY)
          What have you done to her?

          Nothing much. I just bit her a
          little bit, that's all.
          Jerry just stares-at him silently, leaving no room for the
          boy to disbelieve him. Charley suddenly leaps for him,
          furious with rage.

                         CHARLEY
          You bastard!
          .Jerry casually knocks him aside, flinging him through the
          air against the far wall with his incredible strength.
          Charley crumples to the floor, stunned. Jerry walks over
          to him and drops a wooden stake at his feet.

                         JERRY

          dawn. - -
          With a bow he lets himself out of the room, closing the
          door behind him. The key can be heard turning in the
          lack. Charley stares around for a moment, gathering his
          senses. He sees the window has been boarded up with plank
          after plank and nail after nail. It would be impossible
          for him to rip it apart, just as it would be impossible for
          anyone to-hear him through.it were he to scream.
          He crawls to Amy, gently turning her over only to see that
          she has already begun to change, her upper lip slipping
          back as he stares at her, revealing lengthening bicuspids,
          the beginnings of fangs. Her eyes are black, like bottom-
          less pits. He raises his head and screams, his voice 
          filled with anguish and despair.

                         CHARLEY
          No!

          133 EXT. STAIRWAY - NIGHT

          Dandrige pauses halfway down the stairs, listening to the
          agony in Charley's voice as the scream dies away. He
          smiles, then continues to walk down the stairs.

          134 EXT. DANDRIGE HOUSE - NIGHT

          Peter faces the brooding, terrible house, his stake and
          hammer in either hand, his face set hard with deter-
          mination. Throwing his shoulders back, he begins to walk
          slowly toward the front door.

          He slips through the front door, pausing to look down the
          hall. The basement door is open, the sounds of Jerry and
          Billy working down there faintly heard. He hurries up the
          stairs.

          136 INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT

          He works his way from door to door till he finds the locked
          one. He r aps on it lightly, whispering through a crack in
          the frame.

           Charley hears the whisper and springs to his feet, hurrying
           to the door.

           PETER (o.s.)
          I'm going to have to break the door
          down. Make as much noise as you can.
          Charley turns to the wall, beating on it and yelling for
          all he's worth.

                         CHARLEY
          Help, let me out!

          138 INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

          Jerry and Billy are preparing a spare coffin for Amy,
          dumping dirt into it from the bottom of the huge, ornate
          coffin Charley saw them carrying into the house on that
          first night so long- ago. They pause in their work as they
          hear Charley's SCREAM DYING AWAY. Jerry smiles at Billy.

                         JERRY 
          I think she just opened her eyes.

          -Peter hits the door from the outside, snapping the lock,
          letting himself in and closing it as quietly as he can
          behind them. He looks around, spotting Amy lying in the
          corner.

                         PETER

          He falls to his knees beside Amy and rolls her over for
          Peter to see. She is still covered with sweat and
          trembling even more violently now. Her upper lip slips
          back revealing lengthening fangs, just the beginning of

          Jerry pauses in his labor to stare up at the ceiling in the
          direction of the bedroom two floors above, his ear
          cocked. .Billy looks at him.

          He puts down his shovel, heading for the stairs, Billy
          following him.

          Charley glances up from Amy's trembling body to look at
          Peter.

          side of the house past the living room window and up and
          up, the VOICES in Jerry's bedroom getting LOUDER and
          LOUDER as Jerry approaches.

                         CHARLEY
          Are you sure?

                         PETER
          So far everything's just like in the

          hoping.

          floor, and heads for. the door.

          They come out of the bedroom and start. down the steps only
          to find themselves facing Billy Cole coming up the other
          way. They freeze. as Billy stops, a slow smile sliding
          across his grim features.

          He starts up the steps. Peter :pulls a pistol, one of the
          props from his apartment, from-his pocket.

                         PETER
          Stop or I'll shoot.
          Billy stops, still smiling at him,. their eyes locked for
          what seems like an eternity. Then Billy starts up the
          stairs toward him again. Peter points the gun at Billy
          with trembling hands.

                         PETER
          I mean it. Don't force me to

                         SHOOT --
          Billy reaches out his huge hands for Peter's throat. Peter
          FIRES, the bullet punching a neat hole through Billy's
          forehead. The large man freezes, his eyes rolling back in
          his skull.
          Be stands there for a moment and then tumbles backward down
          the stairs, landing with a CRASH at the bottom.
          Suddenly there is the SOUND OF APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS on the
          balcony above. Peter and Charley whirl, staring up at the
          landing above them. A second later Jerry Dandrige steps
          out of the shadows.
          With a smile he starts down the stairs toward them.
          Charley steps forward, thrusting his cross up at Dandrige.

          CHARLEY.

                         STOPS
          Dandrige freezes, his face darkening with fury. Charley
          starts up the steps, Peter close behind him.

                         CHARLEY
          Come on, we have him --
          Dandrige's gaze snaps past Charley's shoulder, down into
          the shadows at the bottom of the stairs where Billy's body
          lies, his eyes glowing as they burn into the corpse for a
          moment before shifting back to Charley and Peter.
          He smiles at the boy.

          He steps back into Amy's room, disappearing from sight.

          Nothing. He's just bluffing.
          Charley continues up the stairs-slowly, the cross held out
          in front of him, Peter hugging his back. Behind them, down
          at the foot of the stairs,,Billy slowly sits up. Peter and
          Charley continue climbing, their gazes fixed ahead. Behind
          them Billy stands and starts to walk up the stairs toward
          them, the first STEP he hits GROANING under his heavy
          weight.
          Charley and Peter freeze, turning to look back. They see
          the huge man coming up the stairs toward them, a thin trail
          of blood leaking from the bullet hole in his forehead.
          Peter whips his pistol out with trembling hands and UNLOADS
          THE ENTIRE REVOLVER into the man, casting a pale of
          gunsmoke in front of him and Charley, obscuring their view
          of the stairway below.
          Suddenly Billy Cole appears through the thick cloud, back-
          ing them up the stairs. Peter stumbles, falling backward,
          .unable to rise in time. Billy leans down, grabbing him and
          jerking him into the air like a ragdoll.,. about to fling him
          over the ballustrade to the floor far below.
          Charley suddenly leaps forward, slamming his stake into the
          creature's heart.

                         CHARLEY
          No!
          Billy Cole freezes, his eyes widening. Be drops Peter
          crashing to the steps and staggers back, grabbing the rail
          for support, hanging there below Peter and Charley for what
          seems an eternity, the stake protruding from his heart..
          As the two watch in horror, Cole's face slowly begins to
          dissolve, skin putrefying and slipping away, revealing the
          grinning skull beneath, the process of dissolution acceler-
          ating as the seconds tick past.
          Suddenly the legs turn to bone and.what remains of the
          body, no more than a skeleton in clothes now, tumbles
          backward down the stairs with a clatter, to land with a
          crash on the floor below, bones rolling in-every direction
          across the portico. They stare down the stairs at his
          remains.

           They rush into Amy's room, Peter stopping to stare at the 
          open window, left that way by Dandrige when he entered and
          left. Charley ignores it, hurrying to Amy, and kneeling by
          her side. He gently turns her over to expose lengthening
          bicuspids as Peter sticks his head out the window. Her
          irises are now more red than before, signaling the trans-
          ition she is making from the living to the walking dead.

          pire smiles, slowly drawing back his clawed hand to tear
          Peter's throat out when the man cranes his neck to look
          over his shoulder. He is just about to when Charley calls
          to him from the room within.

          They come up the staircase to find themselves enclosed in
          darkness. Peter pulls out a flashlight and flicks it on,
          shining it about the musty, filthy room. He pauses as rats
          scatter beneath the unexpected blaze.
          He continues to search with the flashlight, picking out the
          remains of a--ruined window at the far end, the glass shat-
          tered, the window itself flung wide open.

          Both of them approach, staring down at the long chest.
          Peter hands the flashlight to Charley, pulling a stake from
          his pocket, a hammer from his belt. He raises the stake in
          the air, the hammer ready. He nods at the coffin.

          chimney to discover Jerry sitting there as though he's
          just alighted.

           145C INT. ATTIC - NIGHT

          Charley and Peter stare up at the beams overhead as dust
          trickles down, the THUD of Jerry landing above them on
          the roof still loud in their ears.

                         PETER
          Well, now we know where he is.

                         CHARLEY
          Yeah, but what's he doing up there?

          146 EXT. DANDRIGE HOUSE - ROOF - NIGHT

          Jerry sits on the roof, squatting there like some huge
          nocturnal bird of prey, his eyes closed, his lips moving
          in a whisper.

          147 INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Amy lies on the floor, hardly moving now. Suddenly she
          groans and rolls over, throwing a hand over her face as
          though trying to ward off some particularly terrible night-
          mare.

          .148 EXT. ROOF - NIGHT

          Dandrige's face darkens even more in concentration.

                         JERRY
          Amy, awake, I command you to awake!

          149 INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Amy's eyes slowly open. There's not a vestige of human
          life in them. She blinks and her eyes go completely red,
          glowing in the dark.
          Dandrige's voice fills her. mind like distant thunder.

                         JERRY'S VOICE
          Now show me how much you love me,
          Amy, kill them both!
          She rises and moves like a zombie messenger of death toward
          the door to the hallway and the attic above.

          149A INT. ATTIC - NIGHT

          Charley and Peter are still staring up at the attic ceil-
          ing above, the waiting becoming unendurable for Charley.

                         CHARLEY
          I'm going up there.
          He heads for the open window at the far end of the
          attic nearest the stairs.

          He-takes a step after the boy, but he's too late. Charley
          is already out the window.

          149B EXT. ROOF - NIGHT

          Charley climbs onto the roof, a cross in his hand, a stake
          in the other. The roof looks deserted, but hidden behind
          the chimney stands Jerry, waiting for the boy. Unaware of
          the danger., Charley reaches the chimney and stealthily be-
          gins to circle it, sensing danger, the cross and stake in
          hand. He suddenly reaches the side where last we saw Jerry
          only to find no one there. He stands there puzzled,
          looking about.

          PETER (0.3 . )
          (calling up from
          the attic below)
          Do you see him?

                          (SHOUTING BACK)
           No.

          150 INT.'ATTIC 'MIGHT

          Peter stands alone at the far end next to the coffin, ner-
          vously talking.to himself.

                         PETER
          Where the hell is he?
          And in the window directly behind his back, Jerry rises up
          out of the dark, no more than a few feet away, only 'a thin
          pane of glass separating Peter from his clawed hand. He
          raises it to strike through the glass at Peter just as
          .Charley slides in the open window at the far end from the
          roof and sees Jerry in the window behind Peter.. He screams
          out.

                         CHARLEY
          Peter, behind you!
          Peter whirls, holding up his cross and as quickly as he
          appeared from the night, Jerry slips back into it, leaving
          Peter staring at the window, terrified at the close call as
          Charley reaches his' side.

                         CHARLEY
          You okay?

                          150 CONTINUED:
          Peter nods numbly as a huge shadow rises up along the
          staircase wall at the far end of the attic behind them,
          a shadow that suggests Jerry is coming up the stairs
          from the floor below toward them.
          A STAIR CREAKS behind them and Charley and Peter whirl
          to see Amy step out of the stairwell. She looks incred-
          ibly beautiful as though somehow her moment with Dandrige
          has transformed her from virginal girl to a full grown
          woman, dripping with sensuality. Charley steps forward,
          about to rush into her arms.

                         CHARLEY

                         AMY --

                         PETER

                         (GRABBING HIM)
          No!
          Charley looks at Amy as she clears the steps and turns to-
          ward them. Peter shines his flashlight into her face. The
          eyes glow red, the face lifeless, fangs, larger now than
          before, protruding.from her upper lip.

                         CHARLEY
          Oh, my God --
          Suddenly they hear Dandrige cruelly laughing at them from
          the floor below, laughing like this is the best joke he's
          ever heard..

                         CHARLEY
          He's downstairs now --
          Amy suddenly launches herself at Charley, seizing.him by
          the throat and throwing him to the floor, landing on top of
          him. He grabs her by the shoulders, holding her back as
          she tries to plunge her fangs into his neck. Peter steps
          up behind her, a stake raised in his hands, about to plunge
          it into her back.
          Charley screams up at him.

                         CHARLEY
          No!
          Peter shifts his grip on the stake, holding it like a club,
          and brings it slamming down on her back. She collapses un-
          conscious on top of Charley. He shoves her off, climbing
          to his feet, and turning toward the staircase to the floor
          below.

                         CHARLEY

          The two men plunge down the stairs. A second later, Amy
          rolls over, her eyes snapping open, perfectly conscious
          again. She slowly rises.

          151 INT. SECOND-FLOOR LANDING - PORTICO - STAIRS - NIGHT

          The two men come out of the stairway, Peter turning back to
          lock the attic door behind him. Charley starts for Jerry's
          room. Peter grabs him.

                         PETER
          You take downstairs, I'll take up

                         HERE --
          Charley plunges down the stairs to the portico below as
          Peter disappears into the bedroom, searching for Dandrige.

          151A EXT. HOUSE - JERRY'S BEDROOM WINDOW - NIGHT

          The SUBJECTIVE CAMERA WATCHES as Charley heads down the
          stairs, Peter turning for Jerry's room, the CAMERA CRANING
          OFF the window and DOWN around the side of the house,
          PICKING UP Charley up through the front windows as the boy
          disappears down the first floor hall in search of Jerry,
          Jerry watching him the entire time from outside the front
          of the house.

          151E INT..HOUSE - PORTICO - NIGHT

          The front door slowly begins to open, that strange killing
          hand of Jerry holding the doorknob, all that's seen of him
          as he obviously prepares to slip inside.

          151C INT. JERRY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Peter freezes as he hears the front DOOR CREAK and turns,
          racing out the bedroom door onto the balcony.

          151D INT. SECOND-FLOOR BALCONY - NIGHT_

          Peter comes to a halt at the top of the stairs, peering
          down at the portico below. No Charley. He calls out,
          panic struck.

                         PETER
          Charley!
          Charley comes running down the hall, stopping at the bottom
          of the stairs, staring up at Peter..

                         CHARLEY

          The SUBJECTIVE CAMERA STARES in at them, then starts to
          move across the porch and up the side of the house as
          Charley speaks to Peter.

                         CHARLEY
          What?
          The CAMERA PASSES Jerry's bedroom window, catching a
          glimpse of Peter on the balcony just as he replies to
          Charley.

                         PETER
          I don't know. Just my nerves, I
          guess.

          151F INT. HOUSE - SECOND-FLOOR BALCONY - NIGHT

          Behind Peter there is suddenly a POUNDING at the attic
          door. Its Amy, trying to get out. Peter stares wor-
          riedly at the attic door as the POUNDING from within be-
          comes more VIOLENT.
          Suddenly ALL THE CLOCKS on the wall below GO OFF, signaling
          that it's 6 a.m., dawn, time for Jerry to go to bed. 
          Peter takes his eyes off the clocks as the LAST CHIME DIES, 
          looking at Charley over the Balustrade.

                         PETER
          Keep searching for him. Se's got to
          be close. It's almost dawn.
          Charley heads back down the hallway toward the basement as
          above on the landing, Peter stares around, about to try
          another door when suddenly the huge stained glass window
          directly behind and above him bursts apart in an EXPLOSION
          OF SHATTERING GLASS and Jerry Dandrige plunges in from the
          outside, landing in a crouch before Peter.
          He rises as the. older man backs away.
          Charley rushes down the hail back into the portico, brought
          by the sound of the crash. He's about to start up the
          stairs when Dandrige turns and stares down at him.
          Charley ignores him, starting up the stairs. Peter speaks
          to him, never taking his gaze from Dandrige.

                         PETER
          Stay there, Charley --
          Charley freezes, staring up at the vampire and the man
          above, watching, waiting. Dandrige's gaze bores into
          Peter.

                         JERRY
          So. Just the two of us at last.

          He-takes a step for Peter. Peter whips out a cross,
          thrusting it at him. Dandrige stops, smiling at him.
          He starts for him again, Peter holding his ground, the
          cross thrust out in front of hiin.

                         PETER
          Back!

          You have to have faith for that
          to work, Mr. Vincent. Remember?
          Peter continues to hold his ground, the cross held up
          higher, staring defiantly back at Dandrige, refusing to
          drop his gaze. And then it happens: the vampire jerks to
          a halt, staring with slowly dawning fury at Peter, real-
          izing by whatever invisible force it is emanating from that
          cross that indeed Peter has recovered his faith. He stands
          there, stymied, snarling at the man.
          Peter peers over his shoulder, out the ruined window. On
          the horizon, the first pink tendrils of dawn are breaking.
          Now it's Peter's turn to smile as he shifts his gaze back
          to Dandrige.

                         PETER
          Look over your shoulder.
          Dandrige cranes his neck to see the rising dawn through the
          open window, the sun beginning to glint its golden rays
          even as he stares at it. He turns back to Peter, roaring
          with fury.

                         JERRY
          No!
          Peter picks up his stake and dives for the vampire,
          Dandrige is too quick for him.
          He throws himself off the landing, tucking his body into a 
          somersault as he hurls through the air toward the portico
          floor below, turning into a whirling ball of spinning flesh
          only to suddenly emerge- from it no longer a man, but now an
          enormous bat.
          The' bat straightens in midair above the portico and zooms
          down the hallway, smashing into Charley chest high, blowing
          him off his feet as his claws rake the boy, sending two
          bloody furrows down his chest as the bat whips past him and
          disappears down the hallway into the darkness.

          portico below. He rushes to Charley's side, helping the
          badly shaken boy to his feet.

          ing through the basement door. A second later the attic
          DOOR above RIPS FROM ITS HINGES, CRASHING to the floor.
          Amy steps out of the attic, her eyes sightless, a stake
          grasped in her hand.' She walks like an automaton down the
          stairway toward the portico below..

          152 INT. BASEMENT - DAWN

          Charley anaa$ Peter hurry down the stairs into the dark room,
          its windows covered with blackout drapes. The floor is a
          mass of antiques, row after row of them, many covered with
          dust cloths. Peter dives for the first one, ripping the
          cloth off only to discover an armoire. He rushes to the
          next one.

                         PETER
          Quick, his coffin has to be here

                         SOMEWHERE --
          They race down the aisle continuing to rip dust covers away
          only to discover a line of mirrors, several of them
          obviously removed from pieces in the house above. They
          stop, staring at them.

                         CHARLEY
          Well, now we know what he did with
          the mirrors --
          The DOOR to the stairway- CREAKS open behind them, lost
          somewhere in the dark. Peter whirls, looking back the way
          they just came.

          can stop him.
          Charley appears down the row of antiques, stopping at the
          foot of the stairs and staring up at.the basement door
          above. It is partially open, allowing just a sliver of
          light into the darkness. He calls out, clutching his stake

          approaching; her face deathly white, her lips blood red,
          her eyes almost glowing in the dark. He hears her at the
          last second, whirling to face her with a gasp. She reads
          the fear on his face and smiles sadly, reaching out a hand
          to him.

                         AMY
          Don't be frightened, Charley.
          She takes a step closer and he steps away. Amy stops,
          staring at him; then she slowly begins to advance on him,
          unbuttoning her blouse, her voi ce a husky, purring whisper.

                         AMY
          Charley, I love you --
          (he backs away; she
          keeps coming closer,
          exposing more and
          more of her body)
          What's wrong, Charley, don't you want
          me anymore?
          He suddenly breaks her spell, coming to his senses and
          whip ping out his cross, thrusting it. in her face. She
          whirls away with a snarl, burying her face in her hands,
          softly beginning to weep.

                         AMY
          It's not my fault, Charley. You
          promised you wouldn't let him get
          me, you promised.

          He stares at her, guilt boiling up inside of him. He steps
          forward, touching her shoulder, letting the cross drop to
          his side.

                         AMY --
          She whirls, huge fangs flashing, dripping hungry saliva,
          and dives for his exposed throat. He whips the cross up,
          but'not in time, her forearm smashing into his wrist,
          sending the cross whirling away into the darkness. Amy
          straightens, smiling at him, the. huge fangs sparkling in
          the light from the open doorway above. -

          She begins to walk toward him, her sexual interest in
          Charley gone, replaced by mad, driving hunger.
          At the other end of the room, Peter desperately weaves his
          way among the pieces of furniture dotting the floor,
          looking for the coffin. He stops before a huge armoir,
          whips it d own to discover it empty, and is about to move on
          when he glances down. There, at the corner of the armoir,
          is a small hole with rats scurrying in and out. Realizing
          something must be behind the huge piece of furniture, he
          shoves it aside, toppling it CRASHING to the floor.
          A hidden alcove, more a dais than anything else, is
          revealed, a huge window at the back covered with a blackout
          curtain, and Jerry's ornate brassbound coffin sitting in
          the middle, covered with CHATTERING, crawling RATS.
          Peter stares at it, horrified, calling out into the
          darkness behind him.

                         PETER
          Charley, I found it --
          Back at the other end of the room, Charley is backing away
          from Amy as she slowly stalks him, the stake she picked up
          in the attic-in her hands. Charley yells back at Peter.

                         CHARLEY
          Get it open!
          She suddenly leaps for him, .stabbing with the stake only to
          miss him by inches, sending it plunging through the back of
          a chair with her growing strength, shattering it against
          the stone wall behind the chair. She turns on Charley,
          empty-handed now, continuing.to stalk him.
          Before-the dais, Peter stifles his revulsion of the rats
          and leaps forward, rushing to the side of the coffin and
          fumbling with the clasps only to discover they're locked.
          he cries out again..

                         PETER
          He'_s locked it somehow from the
          inside..
          He grabs a hammer from his pocket and starts pounding at
          the clasps, trying to free them while at the side of the
          room Charley continues to back away from Amy, calling back.

                         CHARLEY

                         HURRY --
          He goes to dodge Amy when she leaps forward, shoving a
          bureau across his path, blocking his escape. She smiles at
          him, continuing to back him into a corner.

          Back at the coffin, the clasp finally comes loose beneath
          Peter's pounding and he moves to the next one, smashing at
          it with the hammer desperately. Back at the side of the
          room, Charley dodges Amy, leaping over a pile of refuse in
          his desperation to escape, the girl vampire diving after
          him, her fingers clawing into his back and shredding his
          shirt as he twists out of her grasp.

                         I
          Back at the dais, Peter breaks the last clasp, throws the
          coffin lid open, sees Jerry resting beneath him, the king
          vampire's eyes closed.
          He fumbles a spare stake from his belt, pressing it to
          the creature's heart, about to slam it home with the
          hammer when suddenly behind him Charley crashes INTO VIEW
          on the floor, Amy fixed to his back, rising over his,
          struggling to sink her fangs in his neck. Peter whirls at
          the NOISE, momentarily distracted.
          In the coffin, Jerry's eyes snap open, fixing on Peter.
          With a snarl he sits right up in the coffin behind Peter,
          the man turning back only to find himself face to face with
          the enraged vampire. Jerry opens his mouth, about to kill
          him when Peter slams it home, missing his heart and
          impaling his shoulder.
          The old -actor falls back as the vampire rises out of his
          coffin, the stake protruding from his shoulder, Amy
          stopping in her struggle to kill Charley, both she and the
          boy staring.up at the huge vampire looming over all three.
          With superhuman deliberation, Dandrige pulls the stake
          from his chest and hurls it away. It smashes into a far
          wall, splintering a window, sending a thin ray of light
          into the room. Dandrige turns on Peter, his face con-
          vulsed with hatred. He leaps for him, smashing him into
          a wall, about to sink his fangs into Peter's neck as
          Charley watches.

                         CHARLEY

                         (SCREAMING}
          No!
          He desperately leaps around Amy, reaching for the blackout
          curtain covering the window at the back of the.dais. - She
          jumps after him, grabbing him just as his fingers close
          around the curtain. She pulls him to the floor, her mouth
          open, about to sink her fangs in him as the drape comes
          with him, tearing from the window and sending a huge bolt
          of sunlight streaming into the dank room.

          it hits Jerry Dandrige squarely in the back, whirling him
          away from Peter, picking him up and throwing him across the
          room, slamming him into the far wall, pinning him there
          several feet above the floor.
          He writhes in the golden beam, twisting this way and that,
          but unable to escape as his body slowly begins to smoulder,
          a million small fires breaking out all over him as begins
          to burn.

                         JERRY

          N000000 --- !
          As Peter and Charley watch unable to tear their eyes. away,
          the vampire's body suddenly EXPLODES in a whooshing ball of
          flame that incinerates him instantly, leaving nothing
          behind but the ECHOING SCREAM of a soul finally going to
          hell.
          Amy rolls off of Charley moaning. He turns to her.

                         CHARLEY

                         AMY --
          She slowly opens her eyes, the girl he knew staring back at
          him, her fangs gone. She throws herself in his arms,
          weeping softly. He holds her close, staring across the
          room at Peter who sits beside the coffin, wiping Dandrige's.
          blood from his face and mouth with his handkerchief,
          nothing but silence in the room now, the sun shining mer-
          rily through the window, only a few wisps of charcoal
          floating lazily through the air to remind any of them what
          just happened.

          The Dandrige house is dark, a "For Sale" sign prominently
          displayed on the front lawn. The house itself now seems
          innocuous and ordinary, free forever of the evil that once
          dwelt within. The Brewster house-next door is lit and gay,
          much as it was on the first night we saw it. The TV can be
          heard coming from the house.

          Vincent.

          154 INT. CHARLEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Charley and Amy lay on his bed, making out like crazy,
          the TV tuned in to Fright Night just as it was the first
          evening we met them. They break for a moment as Peter
          Vincent comes up on the screen.

           PETER (V.0.)
          This is Peter Vincent, once more back
          with you as host of Fright Night. I
          thought I'd let the vampires rest for
          a little while.
          (winking into camera)
          Right, Charley?
          (back into his host

                         ROLE)
          Tonight the threat comes not from
          beyond the grave, but from beyond the
          stars as alien beings stalk an unwary
          summer camp in "MARS WANTS FLESH."

                         (PAUSE)
          I do not star in it.
          Amy turns back to Charley, the two of them staring at each
          other, obviously deeply in love. Then she slowly begins to
          undress. Smiling he rises, inadvertently turning to his
          window as he takes his shirt off, much as he did the first
          night. He freezes.
          There in Jerry's window, looking back at him, are a pair of
          red glowing eyes. Charley blinks. He looks at the window
          again. The eyes are gone...
          Behind him, Amy looks at him questioningly.

                         AMY
          Charley, is something wrong?
          With a quizzical shake of his head, Charley slams the
          window shut and turns to her.

                         CHARLEY
          No, nothing.
          He jumps into bed with her,, the two of them beginning to
          make- love as the CAMERA PANS off them to the window,
          pushing out through the window closing in on Jerry's window
          across the way. A pair of red eyes stand there in the
          darkness, staring and staring as the CAMERA MOVES CLOSER
          AND CLOSER. They blink; . they're for real; there is another
          vampire out there and he is watching Charley.

          FADE OUT.
