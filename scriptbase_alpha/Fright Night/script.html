<b>                                  FRIGHT NIGHT
</b>

                                   Written by

                                   Tom Holland
                         

                         

<b>                                                          FINAL DRAFT
</b>                                                        Sep 6th, 1984
                         

<b>          1.
</b>
<b>                         FADE IN:
</b>
<b>          EXT. FULL MOON - NIGHT (AND CREDITS. ROLL)
</b>
          Clouds obscure the starless heavens for a moment, heavy and
          ominous in the black firmament. Then suddenly they clear,
          exposing a full moon streaked with red like a killer's
          face, a stalking moon staring down at man's evil on the
          earth below.
          A HOWL breaks the night, a wolf pursuing its prey perhaps,
          or perhaps something much, much worse. VOICES break the
          perfect stillness.

<b>          JONATHAN (V.0.)
</b>          What was that?

<b>          MISS NINA (V.0.)
</b>          Just a child of night, Jonathan.
          Come, sit here beside me on the
          veranda.

<b>          JONATHAN (V.0.)
</b>          It's chilly out here.

<b>          MISS NINA (V.0.)
</b>          Oh, no, it isn't. It's beautiful. I
          love the night so.

<b>          2 EXT. RANCHO CORVALLIS - NIGHT
</b>
          A middling size town lost somewhere in the Southwest, the
          lights of its sixty some thousand residents twinkling like
          so many Christmas lights in the night.

<b>          JONATHAN (V.0.)
</b>          I've never seen you so beautiful
          before, Nina. So pale, so
          luminescent, so
          He suddenly stops. There is a moment. Then:

<b>          MISS NINA (V.0. )
</b>          Yes?

<b>          JONATHAN (V.0.)
</b>          Your lips are so red.

<b>          MISS NINA (V.O.)
</b>          Are they? Would you like to kiss
          them?
          The CAMERA STARTS TO PUSH IN CLOSER AND CLOSER on the town
          as though searching for the source of the voices.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          2.
</b>
<b>          3 EXT. CHARLEY'S STREET - NIGHT
</b>
          It's a typical middle class suburban street, full of pre-
          1 World War II houses, the substantial places they built
          then, two and three story homes with attics and basements.,
          porches and detached garages.
          There is the SOUND OF A LONG DRAWN OUT KISS as Jonathan and
          Miss Nina's lips meet. The CAMERA. MOVES DOWN the street,
          still looking for the voices.

<b>          4 EXT. DANDRIGE AND BREWSTER HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>

<b>                         V
</b>          The CAMERA PAUSES TO STARE AT the Dandrige house, so dif-
          ferent in look and feel from all the other houses on the
          street. It's huge, almost forboding, its windows dark and
          vacant, its lawn overgrown and weed-infested, a home that
          has obviously been untended for a long time, unlived in and
          uncared for. However the "For Sale" on the lawn has a
          "Sold" sign just beneath it.
          The CAMERA PANS to the Brewster house next door, still
          SEARCHING for those voices. It's in sharp contrast to the
          Dandrige house, newly painted, its lawn neatly shorn, a
          house almost dwarfed in comparison to the Dandrige house,
          but a happy home, its windows lit and smiling out warmly at
          the night.
          The voices seem to be coming from the Brewster house, spe-
          cifically from a dark second-story window that is open to
          the night breeze.

<b>          JONATHAN (V.0.)
</b>          Why are you looking at me so
          strangely, Nina?

<b>          MISS NINA (V.0.)
</b>          Not you, Jonathan. Your neck. Has
          anyone ever told you it was
          beautiful?

<b>           JONATHAN (V.O. )
</b>
<b>                          (UNCERTAINLY)
</b>           No.

<b>           MISS NINA (V.0.)
</b>           Come, lay your head on my breast.
           The CAMERA SLOWLY STARTS TO PUSH IN on the second-.story
           window.

<b>                         5 OMITTED
</b>
<b>          6 INT. BREWSTER HOUSE - CHARLEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          The CAMERA MOVES THROUGH the window, past the billowing
          drapes to find itself staring at a TV, the flickering
          screen the only light in the room.

<b>                         (CONTINUED)
</b>
                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          3.
</b>
<b>                         6 CONTINUED:
</b>          One of those terrible AIP/Hammer horror films is on the
          tube, a woman, obviously a vampire, talking to one of those
          vapid juveniles used so much in these types of films, the
          two of them standing on a veranda to some huge, old house.
          The young man rests his head against her breast, incredibly
          enough, unaware that she is bending toward his neck with
          these huge fangs.
          Just as. she is about to sink them into his jugular, a tall,
          saturnine man steps out of the darkness., wearing a rather
          daffy Victorian suit and carrying a stake and mallet in his
          hand. His name is PETER VINCENT.

<b>          PETER (V.0.)
</b>          Stop, you creature of the Night!
          The vampiress leaps to her feet, her hapless, intended
          victim forgotten. She faces Peter with a, hiss, her fangs
          sparkling in the moonlight.

<b>          MISS NINA (V.O.)
</b>          Who are you who interrupts my nightly
          feeding?

<b>          PETER (V.O.)
</b>          (drawing himself up to
          his full height)
          Peter Vincent, vampire killer!
          He rushes her, the stake held high to plunge into her
          breast and the CAMERA TURNS AWAY from the TV as the sounds
          of the movie CROSS FADE with the SOUNDS OF HEAVY BREATHING,
          LIPS MEETING, TONGUES INTERTWINING in the room itself.
          Only the room, a typical teenager's lair, seems devoid of
          life, the bed empty, schoolbooks untouched sitting on the
          desk. The CAMERA BEGINS TO SEARCH the room, looking for
          the source of this new sound, much more interesting than
          the old flick on the tube.
          And then it finds them, CHARLEY BREWSTER and AMY PETERSEN,
          two sixteen-year olds, on the floor to the far side of the
          bed, wedged between the bed and the window. They are both
          as American as their jeans and making out like crazy. They
          twis.t and turn on the floor, Amy alternating between enjoy-
          ing it and fighting Charley off, both of them white hot
          with their mutual need. As he tries to slip his hand under
          her blouse, she catches-a glimpse of the TV.
          The horror movie has faded out to be replaced by the
          interior of a local TV studio, a tacky graveyard set the
          centerpiece, the visage of Peter Vincent, much older now,
          rising out of a papier mache coffin and filling the screen
          as CREDITS END.

           Rev. 11/16/84 4.

<b>                         6 CONTINUED: (2)
</b>
<b>           PETER (V.0.)
</b>          This is Peter Vincent, bringing you'
          Fright Night Theatre. Tonight's
          journey into horror is "Blood Castle,"
          one of my favorites. And for a very
          good season. I star -in it.
          He does this booming laugh that goes through about ten echo
          chambers as Charley, totally oblivious to the TV, works on
          Amy's bra, trying to get it undone, obviously something she
          doesn't want. She tries to distract him.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          Charley, Peter Vincent's on.

<b>                         CHARLEY
</b>          (fumbling with the bra)
          Forget Peter Vincent.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          But you love him.

<b>                         CHARLEY
</b>          I love you more --
          Behind them, the station break segues into a commercial, a
          bunch of kids singing and dancing joyfully to a Coca-Cola
          commercial. On the floor, Charley finally gets Amy's bra
          undone. That's it for her; she twists away.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          Charley, stop it.
          Be doesn't listen, going for her again, their finger fight-
          ing behind her back, hers trying to get the bra resnapped,
          his trying to keep it undone and get her blouse off at the
          same time. She suddenly pushes him away, really hard this
          time.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          Charley, I said stop it.
          Charley rolls over, leaping to his feet, frustrated as
          hell.

<b>                         CHARLEY
</b>          Jesus, give me a break, Amy. We've

          hard, their young hormones roiling inside them. Then they
          look away, not wanting to see the other's anger, staring at

          shadowy figures carrying what looks very much like a coffin
          toward the storm doors to the Dandrige house next door.
          His mouth drops open as Amyâ€¢slips out of his arms and onto
          the bed, completely unaware of what he's seeing. She
          starts to take off her blouse, Charley no longer looking at
          her, his gaze glued to the weird scene he's seeing out his
          window.

          bound in brass.

          see it, staring intently at his books.
          Suddenly a WOMAN'S SCREAM, high-=pitched and terrified,
          shatters the night. Charley whirls, sending his books
          crashing to the floor, staring out his window at the lit
          window in-the house next.door. The light snaps out, dark-
          ness blanking the entire wall of the Dandrige house. '
          Charley just stares at it, trying to repress a shiver, all
          thoughts of studying Algebra suddenly gone.

          It's the after school hangout, a bunch of tables before a
          fast food joint on the fourth floor of a shopping mall.
          Kids mill about, nearby video game machines going full
          blast, a TV playing the "Young and the Restless" on the
          counter.

          tD The two houses sit there side by side,.only the Dandrige
          house has changed although it's hard to say exactly how.
          It just seems worse than before, more abandoned, more-hulk-
          ing, more... dead.

<b>          17 INT. CHARLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          Charley has the house next door staked out. He sits in a
          chair before his window, all the lights off in his room,
          only the flickering TV to keep him company. It's Peter
          Vincent on Fright Night, another one of his films on, this
          time the volume turned off. Charley holds his binoculars
          in his hand, staring at the dark window of the house next
          door, waiting.

</b>          The TV is just flickering snow now, the channel having
          signed off hours before. Charley still sits in front of
          his window, but he's sound asleep, breathing deeply, lost
          in his dreams. Soft, sensual MUSIC snakes through his open
          window, enveloping him slowly and dragging him awake.
          Groggily he opens his eyes to find himself staring into the
          lit window of the bedroom next door. He sits up with a
          start.
          There is no drawn shade now. Be can see clearly into the
          room and a beautiful teenage girl with long blonde hair
          stands there, framed in the window, slowly taking her
          blouse off. Charley rubs his eyes., hardly able to believe
          what he's seeing. As he watches she drops the blouse to
          the floor and stands there, bare breasted. Charley gulps,
          fumbling for his binoculars.
          He gets them to his eyes just as Jerry Dandrige steps out
          of the shadows behind the girl, gliding across the room
          toward her with incredible grace. To Charley the whole
          thing has.a dreamlike quality, Jerry more an impression
          than a reality. He's thirty maybe, almost beautiful with
          alabaster skin and chestnut hair. He stops behind the
          girl, sweeping her hair back, exposing her tender, young
          neck. He slowly leans down as though to kiss her.
          As Charley watches through his binoculars, unable to tear
          his eyes away, Jerry Dandrige's upper lip slowly begins to
          pull back,. revealing just the hint of fangs, long, razor
          sharp, and sparkling pearly white in the moonlight.
          Suddenly, Jerry Dandrige stops, the fangs poised an inch
          above the girl's throat. He slowly raises his head, star-
          ing out the window across the side yard and into Charley's
          bedroom.

          With an involuntary gasp of terror, Charley steps back into
          the deeper darkness of his room, his hand instinctively
          reaching up to-protect his own throat.
          Jerry Dandrigeâ€¢slowly reaches up and pulls down the shade,
          cutting off all view into the room.
          Charley stands there for a moment, unable to believe what
          he just saw. The binoculars slip from his hand, crashing
          to the floor, and. he whirls, racing out of the room.

          house just in time to see Billy Cole walking away from a
          shiny new black Cherokee Jeep, its back door left open.
          Charley whirls and dashes out of the room, leaving his

          the black Jeep. The rear door is open as though to receive
          some burden, the yard empty, Billy Cole no longer'there.
          Suddenly the back door to the Dandrige house opens again
          and Billy comes out carrying a large bundle in a plastic
          trash bag over his shoulder. 'Charley's mouth falls open as
          he realizes the bundle could'easily be a woman's dead body.
          Billy dumps it in the back of the Jeep and slams the door,
          crossing. in front of the vehicle for the driver's door.
          Suddenly there is a terrific WHOOSH'through the air over
          Charley's head, the moonlight momentarily blotted out, the
          BEATING OF LARGE WINGS above causing the bushes around him
          to bend and sway. It's almost as though a huge bird, a bat
          perhaps, just swooped over his head from the top floor of-
          the Dandrige house. And then silence returns.
          Charley lifts his head, peering about in the darkness just
          in time to see a shape, more a shadow than a man, step out
          of the darkness no more than ten feet away. It's Jerry
          Dandrige.
          He glides toward the Jeep, tossing Billy a woman's purse.

</b>          Here, you forgot this.
          Billy one-hands it out of the air, turning back for the
          Jeep. Just then the back door to Charley's house bangs
          open, sending a shaft of light into the darkness. Judy
          Brewster stands there in the doorway, calling to her son.

          look at the back door to the Brewster house, inadvertently
          staring right at the clump of bushes where Charley.is hid
          .ing.
          Dandrige takes a step forward, his eyes probing the dark-
          ness as though he can actually see through the murky black-
          ness right to where Charley hides.
          Terrified, Charley suddenly leaps to his feet and races
          back into his own yard, disappearing through the back door
          with his mother. Billy steps forward as though to follow
          the boy. Jerry puts out a restraining hand, stopping him.

</b>          No, not at all.
          He steps back from the door, allowing them to enter. The
          house is a mess of cardboard moving boxes and heavy
          Victorian furniture scattered everywhere, a number of the
          pieces still under white dust covers. Clocks line one
          wall, none of them working, all set at 6 p.m.

          Jerry all last night. There was
          nobody else in the house.

<b>                         CHARLEY
</b>          That's a lie.
          (nodding at Billy)
          I saw him carry her body out in a
          plastic bag.

          He takes a step to follow Billy out of the'room when
          Charley, increasingly desperate, stops him.

<b>                         CHARLEY
</b>          Look, I can prove he's lying. Let's
          look in the basement instead.

          Charley meets the big man's gaze and finds his tongue stuck
          to the roof of his mouth. The seconds, tick past. Still
          nothing from Charley. Billy turns to the Lieutenant with a
          smile.

          rubber. Charley stares after him, not knowing what to do
          now.
          He hears the PORCH DOOR of the Dandrige house OPEN behind
          him and whirls to find himself staring at Billy Cole,
          standing on the porch looking back at him, a toothpick in
          his mouth. There's something very unpleasant in the big
          man's eyes:- like murder.
          Charley slowly backs away from him toward his car, Cole's
          eyes following him.. Charley glances down at his wrist-
          watch.' It's four in the afternoon. He glances up at the
          sun overhead. It's beginning to sink, late afternoon and
          all that implies drawing nigh. He looks back at Billy
          Cole. The man is smiling at him now, reading his thoughts.
          Charley leaps into his car and takes off down the street.

          and the Wolfman dotting the wall, the shelves full of

          drink in his hand, smiling at Charley. He's even better
          looking close up, almost blindingly beautiful, too much so
          actually.
          There's something disturbing about it, as though such good
          looks have to cover up an inner putrefaction, some sort of
          hidden, sweet, sickly rot just beneath the perfect pale
          skin.
          He rises, the smile widening as he sees the terror in
          Charley's eyes. He holds his hand out as Judy watches her
          son for his reaction.

          at him. Charley whirls, bolting out of room and pounding
          up the stairway out of sight. Judy turns to Jerry.

          Both houses sit quietly on the street, wrapped in the dark-
          ness of the night air. An ordinary enough image, two
          houses, sitting there, but there's something disturbing
          about it. After.a few seconds one realizes what it-is:
          the Dandrige house almost looks like it's about to pounce
          on its next door neighbor, the Brewster house.

</b>
          Suddenly the shadowy outline of.what might be a huge bat
          swoops past the window outside followed by the BEATING OF
          MIGHTY WINGS. A second later something is heard landing on
          the roof with a heavy THUD.

          Charley sits bolt upright in his bed as he hears it, lis-
          tening hard. But now there's nothing but silence. He
          stares up at the ceiling, listening and waiting.
          Then he hears what SOUNDS LIRE FOOTSTEPS walking across the
          roof. And then silence again. Grabbing the cross and
          holding on to it tightly, he walks toward his door.

<b>          50 INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

          He unlocks the door and pokes his head out, looking up and
          down the hall. Nothing. Then he hears it, a NOISE from
          the floor below. It sounds like fingernails scratching-.
          across glass. He tiptoes to the landing, staring down at
          the shadow enshrouded portico below. The NOISE IS LOUDER
          now, spookier, more insistent. Clutching his cross, he
          starts down the stairs.

<b>          51 INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT'
</b>
          Jerry Dandrige stands above Judy, staring down at her
          sleeping peacefully in her bed. The window behind him is
          now fully open. He glides across the room past Judy's
          bureau with her wigs sitting on it, past the wall mirror
          without leaving a reflection to mark his passing, and out
          the door with unnatural silence.

<b>          52 INT. HALLWAY -.NIGHT

          Jerry closes the door behind him, giving it a sharp tug
          that slightly dislodges it-from it hinges, wedging it..tight
          against the frame. It's something no man of ordinary
          strength could accomplish that easily. He turns away,
          gliding across the hall toward the open door to Charley's
          bedroom.

          sound.

          and seizes him by the throat, choking off all sound.

          Charley nods and Jerry flings the boy the length of the
          room with inhuman strength, slamming him into the far
          wail. Charley slips to the floor, all the air knocked
          out of him. Jerry advances on'him as Charley fights to
          get his breath back.

          He reaches down and grabs the boy, jerking him erect, and
          slamming him against the wall again, Charley's legs
          dangling several feet above the floor. Jerry leans in,
          pressing his face close to Charley.

          trying to get it open. Jerry's head whips back and forth
          between the door to the hall and Charley, the SOUNDS of
          Judy struggling to get her bedroom door open becoming
          louder all the time.
          The door across the hall starts-to give with a groan. With
          a hiss of frustrated fury, the vampire whirls, throws open
          Charley's door, and dashes out into the hail.
          Charley throws off his shock at still being alive and
          plunges after him.

          roof above him, there is the SOUND OF POWERFUL WINGS, beat-
          ing away into the night. air. And then nothing.
          He slowly pulls his head back in and closes the window
          behind him, locking it. He turns to find Judy stumbling

          window as Charley peers through the glass, seeing the sha-

          Peter slowly gets out of the car, stretching to his full
          height. He wears his vampire killer regalia, the Victorian
          suit, and carries a small leather satchel. There is some-
          thing truly majestic about him.. He looks down at Charley,
          laying it on. with a trowel.

          He opens the satchel, withdraws a small crystal vial of
          water, slips it into his jacket pocket, closes the bag, and
          replaces it on the front seat of his car. He locks the car

          Her face is beginning to stiffen, her eyes turning blank.
          Charley looks at her in sudden alarm, remembering the girl
          he saw through the window that night.
          He grabs Amy by the arm, tugging. her toward the door.

          Smiling, Jerry turns to Evil Ed as behind them all Peter
          opens his cigarette case, takes out a smoke, about to tamp
          it down on a thumbnail when he glances at the mirror on the
          inside of the-lid. He sees Amy, Evil Ed, and Charley
          grouped around where Jerry Dandrige should be standing, but
          he's not there. It's as though the kids are talking to
          thin air.

          goes chalk white, his mouth gasps for air, and he drops the
          case from his palsied hands. It smashes to the hardwood
          floor with a crash. Everyone turns and looks at him.

          CLOSER. The fear starts to work at him, twisting up his
          gut and making his forehead sheen with sweat. He steps
          forward, yelling out with false bravery.

          Evil Ed runs like he's never run before,â€¢pounding through
          the dark, smashing into traffic cans and falling to the
          ground, leaping to-his feet, ignoring his skinned hands and

          He suddenly skids to a halt, facing a brick wall. He
          whirls, his breath-coming in ragged gasps now, peering down
          the alleyway into the dark, listening to those FOOTSTEPS
          getting closer and closer. He slowly backs away until he
          has no further to go his back against the brick wall, on
          the verge of hysteria.

          peering into the darkness with something like hope, preying
          that maybe, just maybe, Dandrige has given up.
          A voice suddenly whispers in his ear, no more than an inch
          away.

</b>          Hello, .Edward.
          Evil Ed turns with a scream to find Jerry standing right
          next to him. Almost insane with fear now, slobbering like
          a wounded animal, he backs away from the shadowy figure,
          hitting the corner and sliding to the cold pavement, almost
          curled up in a fetal ball, tears streaming from his eyes.
          Dandrige walks over to him, staring down with something
          like pity in his eyes.

          of you anymore or beat you up. I'll
          see to that. All you have to do is
          take my hand.
          Evil Ed slowly looks up at him through his tear-stained
          eyes to see Jerry staring-down at him, his. hand outstretch-
          ed to.him, a slight smile on his face, gentle, seductive,
          beguiling.

          his pocket and thrusting it directly into Evil Ed's face,
          slamming it into his forehead between his eyes.
          His skin sizzles and cracks, smoke rising, and Evil Ed
          backs away, bent over screaming in pain, his hands held to
          his face.
          He slowly looks up as Peter watches, frozen in horror.

          sign of the cross branded into his forehead. He stares at
          Peter.

</b>          Hey, Donny, this the one?
          Another huge bouncer, the one the cook talked to when
          Charley and Amy sneaked into the club, steps out of the
          whirl staring down at the boy.

<b>                         DONNY
</b>          Yeah, its him.

<b>                         (TO CHARLEY)
</b>          Where's your girlfriend?
          Charley suddenly sees Jerry and Amy breaking through the
          throng, heading for the entrance. He points to them
          wildly.

<b>                         CHARLEY

          He cuts across the floor on a diagonal to intercept Jerry
          and Amy, the black bouncer dragging Charley after him in a
          steel 'grip. Jerry finally reaches the throng near the
          front door, starting to move through it with Amy when sud-
          denly the two bouncers and Charley block his way. Donny
          jerks Amy out of Jerry's hand, passing her to the black
          bouncer, nodding at her and Charley.

          Jerry steps toward Amy, his face beginning to darken with
          rage, the MUSIC pulsating around them, people swirling by
          on all sides.

<b>                         JERRY

          Donny puts out his hand, stopping Jerry as the black

          Jerry snarls, his eyes beginning to glow, his hair slicking
          back slightly, the hint of fangs beginning to protrude over
          his upper lip as rage overtakes him. He raises his right
          hand, holding it out in.front of. the bouncer's face so the
          man can clearly see what is happening. The nails on the
          four fingers pop out, literally elongating several inches
          in front of the man's eyes, growing into razor sharp claws
          that sparkle in the overhead lights.
          The bouncer, terrified, screams for his'companion.

          Toward the entrance to' the club, Leon releases Charley and

          pulling her toward the door.

          But it's. too late already. Donny screams as the talons
          whistle through the air, tearing his throat out in one
          swipe, scattering blood everywhere, blinding several of the
          dancers swirling.by, hitting people drinking at the bar, a
          couple necking in a corner, blood flying everywhere.
          Jerry steps around the corpse as it topples backward over a
          table of coke users, the bouncer's dead eyes staring up at
          them. Leon dashes up, - lunging for Jerry. The vampire's
          hand snaps out, grabbing`him by the throat, squeezing,
          driving those claws deep into the man's neck, holding him
          like a chicken, enjoying a second of his death throes and
          then casually flinging him into the center of the floor,
          bringing the music and all the dancing to a shrieking halt
          as this new group of people stare at another dead body.

          through a side yard across the street.

          It seems to have assumed a life of its own and turned into

          pounce on him.
          Charley grips his stake and hammer, checks the cross stuck
          in his jacket pocket, takes'a deep breath, squares his
          shoulders, and starts the slow walk toward the Dandrige
          house. Through the trees-he moves, into the shadows and
          darkness, across the street, closer and closer,to that

          what seems like an eternity. Then Billy starts up the

          FIRES, the bullet punching a neat hole through Billy's
          forehead. The large man freezes, his eyes rolling back in
          his skull.
          Be stands there for a moment and then tumbles backward down
          the stairs, landing with a CRASH at the bottom.
          Suddenly there is the SOUND OF APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS on the
          balcony above. Peter and Charley whirl, staring up at the
          landing above them. A second later Jerry Dandrige steps
          out of the shadows.
          With a smile he starts down the stairs toward them.

          lies, his eyes glowing as they burn into the corpse for a
          moment before shifting back to Charley and Peter.

</b>          Nothing. He's just bluffing.
          Charley continues up the stairs-slowly, the cross held out
          in front of him, Peter hugging his back. Behind them, down
          at the foot of the stairs,,Billy slowly sits up. Peter and
          Charley continue climbing, their gazes fixed ahead. Behind
          them Billy stands and starts to walk up the stairs toward
          them, the first STEP he hits GROANING under his heavy
          weight.
          Charley and Peter freeze, turning to look back. They see
          the huge man coming up the stairs toward them, a thin trail
          of blood leaking from the bullet hole in his forehead.
          Peter whips his pistol out with trembling hands and UNLOADS
          THE ENTIRE REVOLVER into the man, casting a pale of
          gunsmoke in front of him and Charley, obscuring their view
          of the stairway below.
          Suddenly Billy Cole appears through the thick cloud, back-
          ing them up the stairs. Peter stumbles, falling backward,
          .unable to rise in time. Billy leans down, grabbing him and
          jerking him into the air like a ragdoll.,. about to fling him
          over the ballustrade to the floor far below.
          Charley suddenly leaps forward, slamming his stake into the
          creature's heart.

</b>          No!
          Billy Cole freezes, his eyes widening. Be drops Peter
          crashing to the steps and staggers back, grabbing the rail
          for support, hanging there below Peter and Charley for what
          seems an eternity, the stake protruding from his heart..
          As the two watch in horror, Cole's face slowly begins to
          dissolve, skin putrefying and slipping away, revealing the
          grinning skull beneath, the process of dissolution acceler-
          ating as the seconds tick past.
          Suddenly the legs turn to bone and.what remains of the
          body, no more than a skeleton in clothes now, tumbles
          backward down the stairs with a clatter, to land with a
          crash on the floor below, bones rolling in-every direction
          across the portico. They stare down the stairs at his
          remains.

           They rush into Amy's room, Peter stopping to stare at the 
          open window, left that way by Dandrige when he entered and
          left. Charley ignores it, hurrying to Amy, and kneeling by
          her side. He gently turns her over to expose lengthening
          bicuspids as Peter sticks his head out the window. Her
          irises are now more red than before, signaling the trans-
          ition she is making from the living to the walking dead.

          Peter's throat out when the man cranes his neck to look
          over his shoulder. He is just about to when Charley calls
          to him from the room within.

          shining it about the musty, filthy room. He pauses as rats
          scatter beneath the unexpected blaze.
          He continues to search with the flashlight, picking out the
          remains of a--ruined window at the far end, the glass shat-

          Peter hands the flashlight to Charley, pulling a stake from

          is already out the window.

          Charley climbs onto the roof, a cross in his hand, a stake
          in the other. The roof looks deserted, but hidden behind
          the chimney stands Jerry, waiting for the boy. Unaware of
          the danger., Charley reaches the chimney and stealthily be-
          gins to circle it, sensing danger, the cross and stake in
          hand. He suddenly reaches the side where last we saw Jerry
          only to find no one there. He stands there puzzled,
          looking about.

          vously talking.to himself.

</b>          Where the hell is he?
          And in the window directly behind his back, Jerry rises up
          out of the dark, no more than a few feet away, only 'a thin
          pane of glass separating Peter from his clawed hand. He
          raises it to strike through the glass at Peter just as
          .Charley slides in the open window at the far end from the
          roof and sees Jerry in the window behind Peter.. He screams
          out.

<b>                         CHARLEY
</b>          Peter, behind you!
          Peter whirls, holding up his cross and as quickly as he
          appeared from the night, Jerry slips back into it, leaving
          Peter staring at the window, terrified at the close call as
          Charley reaches his' side.

</b>          Peter nods numbly as a huge shadow rises up along the
          staircase wall at the far end of the attic behind them,
          a shadow that suggests Jerry is coming up the stairs
          from the floor below toward them.
          A STAIR CREAKS behind them and Charley and Peter whirl
          to see Amy step out of the stairwell. She looks incred-
          ibly beautiful as though somehow her moment with Dandrige
          has transformed her from virginal girl to a full grown
          woman, dripping with sensuality. Charley steps forward,
          about to rush into her arms.

          Charley looks at Amy as she clears the steps and turns to-
          ward them. Peter shines his flashlight into her face. The
          eyes glow red, the face lifeless, fangs, larger now than
          before, protruding.from her upper lip.

<b>                         CHARLEY
</b>          Oh, my God --
          Suddenly they hear Dandrige cruelly laughing at them from
          the floor below, laughing like this is the best joke he's
          ever heard..

<b>                         CHARLEY

          Amy suddenly launches herself at Charley, seizing.him by
          the throat and throwing him to the floor, landing on top of
          him. He grabs her by the shoulders, holding her back as
          she tries to plunge her fangs into his neck. Peter steps
          up behind her, a stake raised in his hands, about to plunge
          it into her back.
          Charley screams up at him.

<b>                         CHARLEY
</b>          No!
          Peter shifts his grip on the stake, holding it like a club,
          and brings it slamming down on her back. She collapses un-
          conscious on top of Charley. He shoves her off, climbing
          to his feet, and turning toward the staircase to the floor
          below.

          Behind Peter there is suddenly a POUNDING at the attic
          door. Its Amy, trying to get out. Peter stares wor-
          riedly at the attic door as the POUNDING from within be-
          comes more VIOLENT.
          Suddenly ALL THE CLOCKS on the wall below GO OFF, signaling
          that it's 6 a.m., dawn, time for Jerry to go to bed. 
          Peter takes his eyes off the clocks as the LAST CHIME DIES, 
          looking at Charley over the Balustrade.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          Keep searching for him. Se's got to
          be close. It's almost dawn.
          Charley heads back down the hallway toward the basement as
          above on the landing, Peter stares around, about to try
          another door when suddenly the huge stained glass window
          directly behind and above him bursts apart in an EXPLOSION
          OF SHATTERING GLASS and Jerry Dandrige plunges in from the
          outside, landing in a crouch before Peter.
          He rises as the. older man backs away.
          Charley rushes down the hail back into the portico, brought
          by the sound of the crash. He's about to start up the
          stairs when Dandrige turns and stares down at him.
          Charley ignores him, starting up the stairs. Peter speaks
          to him, never taking his gaze from Dandrige.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          Stay there, Charley --
          Charley freezes, staring up at the vampire and the man
          above, watching, waiting. Dandrige's gaze bores into
          Peter.

          Peter continues to hold his ground, the cross held up
          higher, staring defiantly back at Dandrige, refusing to
          drop his gaze. And then it happens: the vampire jerks to
          a halt, staring with slowly dawning fury at Peter, real-
          izing by whatever invisible force it is emanating from that
          cross that indeed Peter has recovered his faith. He stands
          there, stymied, snarling at the man.
          Peter peers over his shoulder, out the ruined window. On
          the horizon, the first pink tendrils of dawn are breaking.
          Now it's Peter's turn to smile as he shifts his gaze back
          to Dandrige.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          Look over your shoulder.
          Dandrige cranes his neck to see the rising dawn through the
          open window, the sun beginning to glint its golden rays
          even as he stares at it. He turns back to Peter, roaring
          with fury.

<b>                         JERRY
</b>          No!
          Peter picks up his stake and dives for the vampire,
          Dandrige is too quick for him.
          He throws himself off the landing, tucking his body into a 
          somersault as he hurls through the air toward the portico
          floor below, turning into a whirling ball of spinning flesh
          only to suddenly emerge- from it no longer a man, but now an
          enormous bat.
          The' bat straightens in midair above the portico and zooms
          down the hallway, smashing into Charley chest high, blowing
          him off his feet as his claws rake the boy, sending two
          bloody furrows down his chest as the bat whips past him and
          disappears down the hallway into the darkness.

          cloth off only to discover an armoire. He rushes to the

</b>          She begins to walk toward him, her sexual interest in
          Charley gone, replaced by mad, driving hunger.
          At the other end of the room, Peter desperately weaves his
          way among the pieces of furniture dotting the floor,
          looking for the coffin. He stops before a huge armoir,
          whips it d own to discover it empty, and is about to move on
          when he glances down. There, at the corner of the armoir,
          is a small hole with rats scurrying in and out. Realizing
          something must be behind the huge piece of furniture, he
          shoves it aside, toppling it CRASHING to the floor.
          A hidden alcove, more a dais than anything else, is
          revealed, a huge window at the back covered with a blackout
          curtain, and Jerry's ornate brassbound coffin sitting in
          the middle, covered with CHATTERING, crawling RATS.
          Peter stares at it, horrified, calling out into the
          darkness behind him.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          Charley, I found it --
          Back at the other end of the room, Charley is backing away
          from Amy as she slowly stalks him, the stake she picked up
          in the attic-in her hands. Charley yells back at Peter.

<b>                         CHARLEY
</b>          Get it open!
          She suddenly leaps for him, .stabbing with the stake only to
          miss him by inches, sending it plunging through the back of
          a chair with her growing strength, shattering it against
          the stone wall behind the chair. She turns on Charley,
          empty-handed now, continuing.to stalk him.
          Before-the dais, Peter stifles his revulsion of the rats
          and leaps forward, rushing to the side of the coffin and
          fumbling with the clasps only to discover they're locked.
          he cries out again..

<b>                         PETER
</b>          He'_s locked it somehow from the
          inside..
          He grabs a hammer from his pocket and starts pounding at
          the clasps, trying to free them while at the side of the
          room Charley continues to back away from Amy, calling back.

<b>                         CHARLEY
</b>
<b>                         HURRY --
</b>          He goes to dodge Amy when she leaps forward, shoving a
          bureau across his path, blocking his escape. She smiles at
          him, continuing to back him into a corner.

</b>          Back at the coffin, the clasp finally comes loose beneath
          Peter's pounding and he moves to the next one, smashing at
          it with the hammer desperately. Back at the side of the
          room, Charley dodges Amy, leaping over a pile of refuse in
          his desperation to escape, the girl vampire diving after
          him, her fingers clawing into his back and shredding his
          shirt as he twists out of her grasp.

<b>                         I
</b>          Back at the dais, Peter breaks the last clasp, throws the
          coffin lid open, sees Jerry resting beneath him, the king
          vampire's eyes closed.
          He fumbles a spare stake from his belt, pressing it to
          the creature's heart, about to slam it home with the
          hammer when suddenly behind him Charley crashes INTO VIEW
          on the floor, Amy fixed to his back, rising over his,
          struggling to sink her fangs in his neck. Peter whirls at
          the NOISE, momentarily distracted.
          In the coffin, Jerry's eyes snap open, fixing on Peter.
          With a snarl he sits right up in the coffin behind Peter,
          the man turning back only to find himself face to face with
          the enraged vampire. Jerry opens his mouth, about to kill
          him when Peter slams it home, missing his heart and
          impaling his shoulder.
          The old -actor falls back as the vampire rises out of his
          coffin, the stake protruding from his shoulder, Amy
          stopping in her struggle to kill Charley, both she and the
          boy staring.up at the huge vampire looming over all three.
          With superhuman deliberation, Dandrige pulls the stake
          from his chest and hurls it away. It smashes into a far
          wall, splintering a window, sending a thin ray of light
          into the room. Dandrige turns on Peter, his face con-
          vulsed with hatred. He leaps for him, smashing him into
          a wall, about to sink his fangs into Peter's neck as
          Charley watches.

          He desperately leaps around Amy, reaching for the blackout
          curtain covering the window at the back of the.dais. - She
          jumps after him, grabbing him just as his fingers close
          around the curtain. She pulls him to the floor, her mouth
          open, about to sink her fangs in him as the drape comes
          with him, tearing from the window and sending a huge bolt
          of sunlight streaming into the dank room.

</b>          it hits Jerry Dandrige squarely in the back, whirling him
          away from Peter, picking him up and throwing him across the
          room, slamming him into the far wall, pinning him there
          several feet above the floor.
          He writhes in the golden beam, twisting this way and that,
          but unable to escape as his body slowly begins to smoulder,
          a million small fires breaking out all over him as begins
          to burn.

</b>          As Peter and Charley watch unable to tear their eyes. away,
          the vampire's body suddenly EXPLODES in a whooshing ball of
          flame that incinerates him instantly, leaving nothing
          behind but the ECHOING SCREAM of a soul finally going to
          hell.
          Amy rolls off of Charley moaning. He turns to her.

          him, her fangs gone. She throws herself in his arms,
          weeping softly. He holds her close, staring across the
          room at Peter who sits beside the coffin, wiping Dandrige's.
          blood from his face and mouth with his handkerchief,
          nothing but silence in the room now, the sun shining mer-
          rily through the window, only a few wisps of charcoal
          floating lazily through the air to remind any of them what
          just happened.

</b>
          The Dandrige house is dark, a "For Sale" sign prominently
          displayed on the front lawn. The house itself now seems
          innocuous and ordinary, free forever of the evil that once
          dwelt within. The Brewster house-next door is lit and gay,
          much as it was on the first night we saw it. The TV can be
          heard coming from the house.

          Charley and Amy lay on his bed, making out like crazy,
          the TV tuned in to Fright Night just as it was the first
          evening we met them. They break for a moment as Peter
          Vincent comes up on the screen.

<b>           PETER (V.0.)
</b>          This is Peter Vincent, once more back
          with you as host of Fright Night. I
          thought I'd let the vampires rest for
          a little while.

<b>                         ROLE)
</b>          Tonight the threat comes not from
          beyond the grave, but from beyond the
          stars as alien beings stalk an unwary
          summer camp in "MARS WANTS FLESH."

<b>                         (PAUSE)
</b>          I do not star in it.
          Amy turns back to Charley, the two of them staring at each
          other, obviously deeply in love. Then she slowly begins to
          undress. Smiling he rises, inadvertently turning to his
          window as he takes his shirt off, much as he did the first
          night. He freezes.
          There in Jerry's window, looking back at him, are a pair of
          red glowing eyes. Charley blinks. He looks at the window
          again. The eyes are gone...
          Behind him, Amy looks at him questioningly.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          Charley, is something wrong?
          With a quizzical shake of his head, Charley slams the
          window shut and turns to her.

<b>                         CHARLEY
</b>          No, nothing.
          He jumps into bed with her,, the two of them beginning to
          make- love as the CAMERA PANS off them to the window,
          pushing out through the window closing in on Jerry's window
          across the way. A pair of red eyes stand there in the
          darkness, staring and staring as the CAMERA MOVES CLOSER
          AND CLOSER. They blink; . they're for real; there is another
          vampire out there and he is watching Charley.

<b>          FADE OUT.
