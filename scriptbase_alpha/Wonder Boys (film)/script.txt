THE WONDER BOYS

                            WONDER BOYS

                BASED ON THE NOVEL BY MICHAEL CHABON

                       Screenplay/Steve Kloves

     January 21, 1999 (Pink Revision) 
     January 15, 1999 (Blue Revision) 
     December 18,1998


     All IS A BLUR. . .

     ...then WORDS appear, twisting and vaguely transparent, 
     reflected on the window GRADY TRIPP stands before as he 
     reads from a sheaf of NEATLY-TYPED PAGES.

                         GRADY
          'The young girl sat perfectly still in the 
          confessional...

1     INT. CLASSROOM - UNIVERSITY - AFTERNOON

     Grady--45-year-old novelist, professor, and insomniac--is 
     in the midst of reading a story to the dozen college 
     STUDENTS who make up his Advanced Writing Workshop.

                         GRADY
          ...listening to her father's boots scrape like 
          chalk on the ancient steps of the church, then 
          grow faint, then disappear altogether.'

     As he finishes, GRADY ponders a PAIR of MAINTENANCE MEN, 
     perched on ladders in the quad below, stringing a LARGE 
     BANNER between two bare trees. The BANNER reads:

     WELCOME TO WORDFEST

     GRADY turns, peers at his students. They look as if 
     they've been on a field trip to the DMV.

                         GRADY (cont'd) 
               (a wave of the pages) 
          So. .Anyone?

     A GIRL with jet-black hair turns to a PALE YOUNG MAN 
     sitting at a desk in the back of the classroom. He is JAMES 
     LEER, 19. Like GRADY a moment before, he is staring out the 
     window.

                         CARRIE MCWHIRTY 
          Let me get this straight. The girl with the 
          big lips is depressed because, each night, when 
          her father goes off to work at the bakery, her 
          mother sneaks some mysterious lover into the 
          house. Not only does this girl have to listen 
          to her mother working this guy in the next 
          room, she has to wash the sheets each morning 
          before Daddy gets home. After a few weeks of 
          this, she starts to go a little nutty/ so Daddy 
          takes her to confession--only, once she gets in 
          the box, she gets a whiff of the priest and 
          realizes he's the mother's secret lover. Is 
          that it?

     James Leer says nothing, huddling lower in the PATTY 
     OVERCOAT he wears.

                         CARRIE MCWHIRTY
          I mean, Jesus. What is it with you Catholics?

                         GRADY
          All right. Let's try to keep it constructive, 
          shall we? Howard, what about you?

                         HOWARD 
          I hated it.

                         GRADY
          That's not exactly what I meant by 
          constructive, Howard.

                         HOWARD 
          I think James should try to be more 
          constructive. This is my second semester with 
          him. His stories are brutal, man. They make me 
          want to kill myself.

     GRADY glances at James, but his face remains impassive. 
     Then--with a visible sense of relief--GRADY notices the 
     raised hand of the achingly beautiful HANNAH GREEN. 

                         GRADY
          Yes, Hannah?

                         HANNAH GREEN
          I think maybe we're missing the point. It 
          seems to me James' strength as a writer is that 
          he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us 
          like adults. He respects us enough to forget 
          us. That takes . . . courage .

     GRADY nods, smiles subtly. Appreciative.

                         GRADY
          Well put, Hannah. And a good note to end on, I 
          think. 
               (as the students rise) 
          Don't forget about WordFest this weekend. And 
          remember: those of you driving V.I.P.s to 
          tonight's cocktail party need to have them at 
          the Chancellor's house no later than 5:30.

     Hannah Green gathers her things, pauses by Grady.

                         GRADY
          Thanks for that. He all right?

                         HANNAH GREEN
          I think so. ..What about you?

                         GRADY
          Me? Sure. Why?

                         HANNAH GREEN
          Just checking.

     GRADY watches her glide away in her CRACKED RED COWBOY 
     BOOTS, then starts to exit himself. 

                         JAMES LEER 
          Turn out the light, please.

     GRADY pauses, studying the wan figure sitting at the back 
     of the classroom, then--reluctantly-hits the switch on the 
     wail, leaving James Leer alone in the DARK.

2     INT. STAIRWELL/CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON (MOMENTS LATER) 

     GRADY hurries down the steps, then spies SARA GASKSLL, 
     45, standing below. She is talking to a BOY with an armful 
     of SLICK PROGRAMS.

                         SARA 
               (calm but firm) 
          No, Elliot, I said five hundred programs for 
          today. This means we have no programs for the 
          weekend. This means that tomorrow morning, at 
          9AM, several hundred people will walk into Thaw 
          Hall and have absolutely no idea where they are 
          going. 
               (shaking her head) 
          It's all right, Elliot. I'll take care of it.

     GRADY watches Sara take the programs, turn, and spot him. 
     There is the slightest of hesitations, then....

                         SARA 
          Professor Tripp.

                         GRADY
          Chancellor.

                         SARA 
          I got the message you called.

                         GRADY
          I got the message you called too.

     This hangs in the air, awkward somehow, then both nod and 
     continue on, without so much as a backward glance. 

3     INT. GRADY'S CAR - MOVING

     The RADIO BLASTS as GRADY pops the glove box, removes a 
     JOINT as big as his pinky, and wheels his DARK MAROON '66 
     GALAXIE RAGTOP away from campus, cruising under another 
     BANNER:

     WELCOME TO WORDFEST FEBRUARY 26-28

4     EXT. GALAXIE - MOVING.. - PITTSBURGH 

     GRADY cruises past the three rivers and modest 
     skyscrapers of downtown, sipping at the weed. 

5     INT. PITTSBURGH AIRPORT

     GRADY rides the long, automated treadmill that runs half 
     the length of the terminal, until...

6     INT. ARRIVAL GATE - PITTSBURGH AIRPORT

     ...TERRY CRABTREE--Grady's editor and friend-exits the 
     tunnel with a STUNNING YOUNG WOMAN in a skin-tight black 
     dress, bright red topcoat, and three-inch spike heels.  
     Grinning devilishly, Crabtree whispers something in the 
     woman's ear, then spots Grady.

                         CRABTREE 
          Tripp!

                         GRADY
          How are you, Crabtree?

                         CRABTREE 
          Brimming. Say hello to my new friend, Miss 
          Antonia. . .uh. . . .

                         WOMAN 
          Sloviak.

                         CRABTREE 
          I took the liberty of inviting Antonia to 
          tonight's festivities. You don't mind, do you. 
          Trip? ?

                         GRADY
               (a slight beat) 
          The more the merrier.

                         MISS SLOVIAK 
          Terry was telling me about you on the plane. 
          It was ail so interesting.

                         CRABTREE 
          I was explaining to Antonia how a book comes 
          to be published. What you do as a writer, what 
          I do as an editor...

                         GRADY
          I sweat blood for five years and he checks for 
          spelling.

                         MISS SLOVIAK 
               (indicating Crabtree) 
          That's exactly what he said.

                         CRABTREE 
          We know each other pretty well. 
               (to Grady) 
          So where's Emily?

                         GRADY
          Emily?

                         CRABTREE 
          Your wife.

                         GRADY
          Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.

                         CRABTREE 
          Perfect. Well then, shall we?

     GRADY nods, but lingers briefly--studying the 
     architecture of Miss Sloviak's ankles as she CLICKS off in 
     her spike heels, arm in arm with Crabtree.

7     INT. BAGGAGE CAROUSEL - AIRPORT - MOMENTS LATER

     GRADY and Crabtree watch suitcases tumble as Miss Sloviak 
     sits across the way, inspecting her face in a compact.

                         CRABTREE 
          Do you know how many times I've boarded an 
          airplane praying someone like her would sit 
          down beside me? Particularly while I'm on my 
          way to Pittsburgh.

                         GRADY
          Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great 
          cities.

                         CRABTREE 
          If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no 
          argument from me.

                         GRADY
          She's a transvestite.

                         CRABTREE 
          You're stoned.

                         GRADY
          She's still a transvestite.

                         CRABTREE 
          Mm.

                         GRADY
          Isn't she?

     Crabtree ignores Grady's question, smiling placidly as he 
     watches the carousel spin.

                         CRABTREE 
          So how's the book?

     GRADY stiffens. He had been expecting this, but not so 
     soon. He tries to act casual.

                         GRADY
          It's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort 
          of. ..tinkering with it.

                         CRABTREE 
          Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it 
          sometime this weekend. Think that might be 
          possible?

                         GRADY
          I don't know. I'm sort of at a critical. . . 
          juncture .

                         CRABTREE
          I thought you were tinkering.

                         GRADY
          I just mean. . .

                         CRABTREE
          Forget I asked. I don't want to pressure you, 
          Tripp. But...
               (pointedly)
           ...I get pressure. Know what I mean?

     GRADY ponders this, troubled by it. Suddenly, Crabtree's 
     face brightens again.

                         CRABTREE
          Ah. ..well now. What do you suppose that would 
          be?

     GRADY turns, watches an immense PONY HIDE CASE drop onto 
     the carousel.

                         GRADY
          That would be a tuba.

8     INT. GRADY'S CAR - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON                8

     As the Galaxie emerges from a TUNNEL, GRADY watches the 
     great city of Pittsburgh reveal itself in the distance, 
     then glances in the rearview mirror.

                         GRADY
          That perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It 
          wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it?

                         MISS SLOVIAK
          Why yes. How did you know?

                         GRADY
          Lucky guess.

                         CRABTREE
          You didn't actually purchase this car, did 
          you. Trip??

                         GRADY
          It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.

                         CRABTREE 
          He owes God money. You know, he queered 
          himself for good with Esquire.

     GRADY takes a joint from the ashtray, snaps a Scripto 
     butane.

                         GRADY
          He said something about being between things.

                         CRABTREE
          Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken 
          legs.

9     EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER  

     A YOUNG WOMAN with a crumpled PITTSBURGH STEEIERS 
     UMBRELLA exits the building and-seeing GRADY parked in 
     front of a fire hydrant--stops, a puzzled expression on her 
     face. As she approaches, GRADY roils down the passenger 
     window.

                         GRADY
          Hi, Tanya. 
               (to the others) 
          This is Tanya. My wife's secretary.

     CRABTREE and MISS SLOVIAK smile and nod. Tanya smiles and 
     nods back, her eyes passing uneasily over Grady's joint.

                         TANYA 
          Grady.. ..Emily's not here.

     GRADY just smiles, nods.

                         TANYA (cont'd) 
          Is there anything I can do for you?

     GRADY watches a tiny stream of water trickle through 
     Tanya's sad umbrella.

                         GRADY
          You're leaking, Tanya.

     Tanya nods--at a loss-then turns away into the rain.

                         CRABTREE
          Trip? ?

                         GRADY
          She left me. Crabs.

                         CRABTREE
          Left you...?  Who? Emily?

                         GRADY
          This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.

                         CRABTREE
          But. ..why didn't you say something, Tripp? I 
          mean, what are we doing here?

     GRADY gazes at the glittering scene beyond his 
     windshield, turns on the ignition.

                         GRADY
          I thought maybe I made it all up.

10     EXT. GASKELL HOUSE - EVENING 

     Through the windows, a rabble of writers, faculty and 
     select students can be SEEN, mingling under a haze of 
     cigarette smoke. GRADY brings the Galaxie to a lurching 
     halt across the street, parks in front of another fire 
     hydrant. As the trio steps out. MISS SLOVIAK notices a 
     GREENHOUSE, shimmering quietly in the chill night air.

                         MISS SLOVIAK
          That's a nice greenhouse.

                         GRADY
          It's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby.

                         CRABTREE
          I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby, 
          Tripp.

                         GRADY
          Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.

                         CRABTREE
          Oh, I'm sure you'll find another. You always 
          do.

11     EXT. FRONT PORCH - GASKELL HOUSE  

     As the front door swings open, Sara Gaskell appears, 
     riding a wave of jagged party CHATTER onto the porch.

                         SARA 
          Well, hello, everyone. Terry, good to see you 
          again. 

                         CRABTREE
          Chancellor. Don't you look ravishing.

                         SARA
          Aren't you sweet to say so. I was beginning to 
          wonder if you were ever going to--oh!

     As Sara steps forward, her heel-catches and she pitches 
     forward ...into Grady's arms.

                         GRADY
          Easy there.

                         SARA
          I'm sorry. It's these goddamned shoes. I don't 
          know how anyone actually walks in these things.

                         MISS SLOVIAK
          Practice.

     Sara looks at Miss Sloviak, a faint glitter of scientific 
     curiosity in her eye.

                         SARA
          I don't believe we've met...

                         MISS SLOVIAK
          Antonia. Antonia Sloviak--

     Just then, a THICKLY-MUCSCLED DOG with very strange EYES 
     skitters around the corner, BARKING SAVAGELY in the general 
     direction of Grady.

                         SARA
          Poe!

                         CRABTREE
               (mildly)
          This wouldn't be Walter's dog, would it?

     Poe continues to rage, his paws doing crazy eights on the 
     hardwood floor, until he's spun himself completely around 
     and is barking at the living room.

                         MISS SLOVIAK
          Who ' s he barking at now?

                         GRADY
          He's still barking at me. He's blind.

                         SARA
          Poe' Hush! Now stop this. Honestly.

     As Poe simmers to a deep growl, GRADY leans forward.

                         GRADY
          I need to talk to you.

                         SARA
          That's funny. I need to talk to you, too. 
               (strategy in her tone)
          Perhaps you could put some of these coats in 
          the upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp.

                         GRADY
               (reading her)
          I don't believe I know where the upstairs 
          guest room is.

                         SARA
          Well then. I'd better show you. Terry--

                         CRABTREE
          We'll just make ourselves at home.
               (kneeling by Poe) 
          Won't we, Poe? Yes, yes....

12     INT. UPSTAIRS ROOM 

     GRADY enters a room swimming in BASEBAIL MEMORABILIA. 
     AUTOGRAPHED BASEBALLS abound, as well as PHOTOGRAPHS of 
     famous big-leaguers. In one somewhat-dated PHOTO a TRIM MAN 
     IN HIS FORTIES (a younger Walter Gaskell) stands with 
     PITTSBURGH PIRATE BILL MAZEROSKI at an old-timers game. As 
     Sara eases the door shut, GRADY nods to a 1951 YANKEE'S 
     PENNANT hanging over the mantle.

                         GRADY
          New?

                         SARA 
               (nodding)
          Walter just got it back from the framer today.

     Sara takes Grady's hand, drawing him away from the 
     pennant and down onto the coat-covered bed.

                         SARA 
          You go first.

                         GRADY
          All right. This morning--

                         SARA 
          I'm pregnant.

     A flash of LAUGHTER flutters from the living  room below. 
     GRADY starts to speak.

                         SARA 
          I'm sure.

                         GRADY
          Well. This is...surprising. Does Walter... ?

                         SARA
          I think Walter would find this a little more 
          than surprising.

     GRADY nods, getting her drift, then roils onto his back.

                         GRADY
          Emily left me this morning.

                         SARA
          She's left before...

                         GRADY
          She's left the room before. She always came 
          back.

     Sara nods. Considers this.

                         SARA
          So. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry 
          each other, and have this baby, right? Simple.

                         GRADY
          Simple.

     GRADY and Sara stare at the ceiling. Sara sniffs the coat 
     lying beneath her. Miss Sloviak's coat.

                         SARA
          Is that Cristaile?

                         GRADY
          Hm.

                         SARA 
               (weary)
          My God, I wear the same scent as a 
          transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: 
          she?

                         GRADY
          If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is 
          by the end of the evening.

                         SARA
          Has he asked to see the book yet?

                         GRADY
          Yes.

                         SARA
          And? Are you going to tell him?

                         GRADY
          No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm 
          going to do.

                         SARA 
               (distantly) 
          Neither do 1.

     GRADY starts to pull up, but his arm is underneath Sara.

                         GRADY
          Sara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey.

                         SARA
          I guess you're going to have to chew it off 
          then.

13     INT. LIVING ROOM - GASKELL HOUSE   

     Poe noses blindly through a forest of legs, pauses by 
     Miss Sloviak's high heels and scores a Rye Krisp. Crabtree, 
     returning with a pair of DRINKS, tiptoes around him, finds 
     MISS SLOVIAK chatting with a trim MAN in his 50's.

                         CRABTREE
          Walter! I see you've met my friend.

                         WALTER GASKELL 
          Yes . She' s charming.

                         MISS SLOVIAK
               (taking her drink)
          Walter's been telling me the most fascinating 
          things about Marilyn Monroe and. ..who was it?

                         WALTER GASKELL
          Joe DiMaggio. Simply put, Antonia, it' s my 
          contention that their marriage tapped into the 
          very id of American popular culture. Joe 
          DiMaggio represented, metaphorically speaking, 
          the Husband as Slugger.. And, though it may be 
          controversial, I personally believe every 
          woman, in some way, desires to be Marilyn 
          Monroe.

                         MISS SLOVIAK
          Oh, I couldn't agree more.

     NEW ANGLE

     GRADY works his way through the crowd, spies Walter, and 
     changes course. Directly ahead is an oddly commanding MAN 
     ("Q"). From the behavior of the people in his vicinity it's 
     clear he is someone of interest. Presently, he is putting 
     the make on Hannah Green.

                         Q
          And while my latest has been on the New York 
          Times bestseller list for 40 weeks, I can't 
          help but lament that my first book, which 
          contains what I consider my finest writing, was 
          remaindered in less than five. So, I find 
          myself conflicted.

                         GRADY
          Ask him if he's conflicted about his house in 
          the Hamptons.

                         HANNAH GREEN
               (brightening)
          Grady.

     Q eyes GRADY over his wine glass.

                         Q 
          Hello.. .Professor.

                         GRADY
          Q,. Hannah's had two stories published in The 
          Paris Review. You'd best dust off the 'A' 
          material for her.

     As GRADY moves off, he sees Poe sniffing, and goes the 
     other way, heading directly into the crosshairs of a MAH IN 
     TWEED, who is talking to another, shorter MAN.

                         MAN IN TWEED 
               (to short man)
          A supermarket for the mind, my ass. I'm 
          telling you, they're nothing but a big, fat mob 
          laundry. Have you ever been to Davenport, Iowa? 
          Let me tell you, they need a 30,000-square-foot 
          bookstore like they need another goddamn cow.
               (as GRADY passes) 
          Grady!

                         GRADY
          Hello, Nathan.

                         MAN IN TWEED
          My God, I haven't seen you since, what? The 
          PEN/Faulkner Awards. That was a big night for 
          you, Grady.
               (to his friend)
          GRADY was there for Arsonist's Daughter,

     The short man blinks, impulsively takes Grady's hand.

                         SHORT MAN
          Douglas Triddly, Amherst. I kid you not when I 
          say Arsonist's Daughter belongs in the pantheon 
          of late twentieth century fiction. I've had it 
          on my Graduate Studies syllabus three years 
          running.

                         GRADY
               (pulling away) 
          No wonder it's still in print.

     As GRADY flees, he passes a WOMAN holding a cigarette.

                         WOMAN WITH CIGARETTE
          ...can take my word for it, writer's are lousy 
          fucks. Poets aren't bad, but then you've got to 
          deal with the sweater thing. They'll discover 
          the cancer in your heart every time, but God 
          forbid they find a decent dry cleaner.

14     EXT. REAR GASKELL HOUSE - NIGHT   

     GRADY comes out the back: door and ferrets a JOINT from 
     his pocket, lights it. He takes a long draw, walks around 
     the side of the house. As he passes a window, a VOICE 
     accosts him.

                         MAN'S VOICE 
          There you are.

     GRADY starts, but when he looks through the window, he 
     sees that the VOICE belongs to WALTER GASKELL and the 
     person to whom he's talking is Sara. They are standing in 
     the kitchen, near an elaborate WINE RACK.  

                         WALTER
          I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in 
          here. You haven't seen it, have you?

                         SARA
          I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if 
          I was sitting on it.

                         WALTER
          You'd recognize it if you tasted it.

                         SARA
          I doubt it, darling.

                         WALTER
               (angling & bottle to the light)
          Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he 
          will be addressing 500 people in little over an 
          hour...

                         SARA
          You want to keep him happy.

                         WALTER 
          If he' s happy. . .
               (kissing her as he exits) 
          I'm happy.

     As Walter goes, GRADY studies Sara as she stands alone in 
     the quiet little room, looking small and tired. Finally, 
     she takes a breath, steeling herself, and moves off, 
     returning to the clamor inside her house.

     GRADY sighs, guilt-stricken, then detects a FLICKER of 
     LIGHT coming from the darkness beyond. A FIGURE is watching 
     him from the retaining wail that leads to the Gaskell's 
     garage. GRADY blinks, chagrined that he's been caught 
     eavesdropping, then his eyes narrow and he steps off the 
     porch.

                         GRADY
          James?

     James Leer wears the same nasty overcoat from class, a 
     GREEN KNAPSACK hanging off one shoulder. GRADY looks at 
     what appears to be a sliver of moonlight in James' palm.

                         JAMES LEER 
          It's fake.

     James' face betrays his own fragile chagrin and GRADY 
     peers more closely at what lies in his extended hand. The 
     sliver of moonlight is, in fact, a shiny PEARL-HANDLED 
     PISTOL.

                         JAMES LEER
          It was my mother's. She won it in a penny 
          arcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic 
          school.

                         GRADY
          It's very convincing.

                         JAMES LEER
          It used to shoot these little paper caps, but 
          they don't make them anymore. The caps.

     GRADY reaches for the gun, but James closes his fingers 
     and slips the tiny thing back into his overcoat.

                         JAMES LEER
          It's just. ..for good luck. Some people carry 
          rabbits' feet...

                         GRADY
          ...You carry firearms.

     As GRADY exhales a plume of smoke, James' eyes pass 
     briefly over the jay. GRADY
     notices, offers.

                         JAMES LEER
          No, thank you. I don't like to lose control of 
          my emotions.

     GRADY nods, accustomed to James' weirdness.

                         JAMES LEER
          I'm not supposed to be here, in case you were 
          wondering. I crashed. I mean, not 
          intentionally...

     James nods toward the house, where Hannah Green can be 
     seen in a window, still fending off the determined Q.

                         JAMES LEER (cont'd)
          ...but the other night, Hannah and I were 
          together, at the movies, and she asked me. 
          Since she was coming. So I ended up coming. 
          Too.

     GRADY nods, ponders this over-elaborate explanation.

                         GRADY
          Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James ?

                         JAMES LEER 
          No! What gave you that idea?

                         GRADY
          Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent 
          her a room.

                         JAMES LEER
          She likes old movies like I do, that's ail.
               (glancing back at the window) 
          Besides, she doesn't really know me. She 
          thinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's 
          because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic.

                         GRADY
          Maybe it's because she's beautiful and she 
          knows it and try as she might to not let that 
          screw her up, it's inevitable that it will in 
          some way.

     James looks away from the window, at Grady.

                         JAMES LEER
          You're not like my other teachers, Professor 
          Tripp.

                         GRADY
          You're not like my other students, James. So 
          what was the movie you two saw?

                         JAMES LEER
          Huh? Oh. Son or Fury. With Tyrone Power and 
          Frances Farmer.

                         GRADY
          She went crazy, Frances Farmer.

                         JAMES LEER
          So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.

                         GRADY
          Sounds like a good one.

                         JAMES LEER 
               (a crooked smile) 
          It's not bad.

     GRADY considers James' fragile face.

                         GRADY
          Listen, James, about this afternoon. In 
          workshop. I'm sorry. I think I let things get a 
          bit out of control.

                         JAMES LEER
          They really hated it. I think they hated it 
          more than any of the other ones.

                         GRADY
          Well...

                         JAMES LEER
          It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to 
          write.

                         GRADY
               (truly impressed) 
          Really? That's remarkable.

                         JAMES LEER
          I have trouble sleeping. While I'm lying in 
          bed I figure them out. The stories.

     As James gazes off at the gloaming greenhouse, GRADY 
     looks down at the left front POCKET of James' overcoat. 
     Like a nervous tic, James' hand- hidden-twitches against 
     the modest bulk of the cap gun.

                         GRADY
          You cold, James?

                         JAMES LEER 
               (distant) 
          A little.

                         GRADY
          So what are you doing out here?

                         JAMES LEER 
          It's colder in there. -

                         GRADY
               (laughing) 
          You're right.

     James blinks, startled by Grady's laughter, startled that 
     he's said something funny. He looks back to the greenhouse

                         JAMES LEER
          Actually, I saw the greenhouse. So I thought 
          ...I thought I'd come out here and take a look 
          at it. You don't see one of those every day. It 
          looks like heaven...

                         GRADY
          Heaven?

                         JAMES LEER
          I saw a movie once. Part of it took place in 
          heaven. Everyone wore white and lived in 
          crystal houses. Like that. At least that's the 
          way I remember it...

     Abruptly, James glances at his watch.

                         JAMES LEER 
          I should be going.

     James turns away, then stops. He stands like this a 
     moment, then turns back. Holds out his right hand.

                         JAMES LEER (cont'd) 
          Goodbye, Professor Tripp.

     GRADY hesitates, then shakes James' hand. James moves off 
     then, leaving the light of the house behind.

                         GRADY
          James. 
               (as he stops)
          Don't leave just yet. There's something I 
          think you ought to see.

                         JAMES LEER 
          I'll miss my bus.

                         GRADY
          This is worth it.

     James looks conflicted.

                         GRADY (cont'd) 
          Trust me.

15     INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER  

     It's quieter now, the party winding down, as GRADY sneaks James past 
     the departing guests and toward the stairs.        

                         HANNAH GREEN
          Hey, you two.

     GRADY stops, sees Hannah slipping on a coat in the foyer.

                         HANNAH GREEN (cont'd) 
          Are you riding with me, James?

                         JAMES LEER 
          No, I'm going ho--

                         GRADY
          He's going with me. You take Crabtree. And his 
          friend. All right?

                         HANNAH GREEN
          Ail right. By the way, his friend...?

                         GRADY
          The answer's yes. I think. Yes. I don't know. 
          Where are they exactly?

                         CRABTREE
          Here we are!

     CRABTREE appears at the top of the landing with Miss 
     Sloviak. Her lipstick is blurry.

                         CRABTREE
               (spying James) 
          Nell, hello there.

     CRABTREE steps down the stairs, hand extended. James 
     Leer's pale fingers rise as if on a string.

                         GRADY
          James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.

                         HANNAH GREEN
          James'll know about George Sanders.

                         JAMES LEER 
          George Sanders?

                         HANNAH GREEN
          Mr. CRABTREE was saying how George Sanders 
          killed himself, only he couldn't remember how.

                         JAMES LEER
          Pills. August 25, 1972. In a Costa Brava hotel 
          room.

     The few people within earshot glance oddly at James, but 
     Crabtree's eyes glitter with intrigue.

                         CRABTREE
          How comprehensive of you.

                         HANNAH GREEN
          Oh, James is amazing. He knows all the movie 
          suicides. Go ahead, James. Tell them who else.

                         JAMES LEER 
          There's so many...

                         HANNAH GREEN
          Just a few then. The big ones.

     James glances at the loose group of people around him, 
     watching, then...

                         JAMES LEER
          Pier Angeli, 1971 or '72, also pills. Charles 
          Boyer, 1978, pills again. Charles Butterworth, 
          1946, I think. In a car. Supposedly it was an 
          accident, but, you know. . . 
               (a trace of irony)
          He was distraught. Dorothy Dandridge, she took 
          pills in, like, 1965. Albert Dekker, 1968, he 
          hung himself. He wrote his suicide note in 
          lipstick on his stomach. Alan Ladd, '64, more 
          pills, Carole Landis, pills again, I forget 
          when. George Reeves, Superman on TV, shot 
          himself. Jean Seberg/ pills of course, 1979. 
          Everett Sioane-- he was good--pills. Margaret 
          Sullavan, pills, Lupe Velez, a lot of pills. 
          Gig Young. He shot himself and his wife in 
          1978. There are more but I don't know if you 
          would have heard of them. Ross Alexander? Clara 
          Blandick? Maggie McNamara? Gia Scaia?

                         HANNAH GREEN
          I haven't heard of half of those.

                         CRABTREE
          You did them alphabetically.

     James turns, finds Crabtree's laser eyes on him. James 
     blinks, as if he had forgotten about Crabtree, then shrugs 
     shyly, looks away.

                         JAMES LEER
          That's just how my brain works, I guess.

                         CRABTREE
          Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out 
          with us after the lecture. There's a place on 
          the Hill I always get Trip to take me.

                         JAMES LEER
          Actually. ..I just want to go home.

                         CRABTREE
          Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants 
          to go home. Besides, faculty will be present. 
          Just think of it as a field trip.

     As he exits, CRABTREE raises an eyebrow to Grady, as if 
     to say: "Bring him."   MISS SLOVIAK follows, eyeing James 
     glacially as we CUT TO:

     BLACK

     The dull PURR of a COMBINATION LOCK is HEARD, a DOOR 
     opens, and a triangle of LIGHT falls on a PHOTOGRAPH of 
     MARILYN MONROES JOE DIMAGGIO on their wedding day.

16     INT. CLOSET - GASKELL HOUSE   

     GRADY and James Leer stand in the doorway. Just below the 
     photograph of Marilyn and Joe--hanging next to a PIN-
     STRIPED JERSEY bearing the number 5--is a SHORT BLACK SATIN 
     JACKET trimmed with an ERMINE COLLAR.

                         JAMES LEER 
          Is that really it?

                         GRADY
          That's really it.

                         JAMES LEER
          The one she wore on her wedding day?

                         GRADY
          So I'm told.

     James, in the presence of the holy grail of suicide 
     garments, stands speechless.

                         GRADY
               (cont'd) 
          Go ahead.

                         JAMES LEER 
          Really?

                         GRADY
          Really.

     James swallows, then'-goes to the jacket. Carefully, he 
     reaches out his fingers and touches the yellowed collar, 
     barely making contact, as though it might crumble to dust.

                         JAMES LEER
          They're glass. The buttons.

                         GRADY
          Like the lady herself.

     GRADY says this airily, ironically, riding his buzz a 
     bit, but James nods solemnly, eyes transfixed on the 
     jacket, as if Marilyn herself were inside it.

                         JAMES LEER
          She was small. Most people don't know that. 
          The shoulders are small.
               (touching the satin)
          It looks so perfect. I bet it's the only time 
          she wore it. That day. She must've felt so 
          ...happy.

     GRADY studies James as he takes the fringe of the jacket, 
     lifts it lightly.

                         JAMES LEER
          It's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or... 
          something. It must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot.

                         GRADY
          I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth 
          about how much he pays for these things.

                         JAMES LEER
          You're really good friends with the 
          Chancellor, aren't you?

     Grady's eyes slide, paranoid, but James' face remains 
     unchanged, consumed with the jacket.

                         GRADY
               (carefully)
          Pretty good. I'm friends with Dr. Gaskell, 
          too.

                         JAMES LEER
          I guess you must be, if you know the 
          combination to his closet and he doesn't mind 
          your being here in their bedroom like this.

                         GRADY
          Right.

     A DOOR SLAMS downstairs and GRADY and James jump. The 
     CLICK of a woman's HIGH HEELS sends GRADY to the bedroom 
     window, where he watches Sara slide into a WHITE CITROEN 
     DS23, turn on the ignition, and motor away.

                         GRADY
          We, better skedaddle. Close that closet-- 
          James? You ail right?

     James is slumped on the Gaskell's white linen bed, 
     knapsack between his knees, head in hands.

                         JAMES LEER
          I'm sorry. Professor Tripp. Maybe it's seeing 
          that jacket that belonged to her. It just 
          looks...really lonely. Hanging there. In a 
          closet. Maybe I'm just a little sad.

                         GRADY
          Maybe. I'm feeling a little sad myself 
          tonight.

                         JAMES LEER 
          You mean, with your wife leaving you and ail? 
               (off Grady's look)
          Hannah mentioned something about it.   About a 
          note.

                         GRADY
          Yes. Well. It's complicated, James. I think we 
          should go now.

     Without thinking, GRADY flicks out the bedroom light, 
     leaving James Leer in the dark for the second time today.

     James just sits there, a shadow in a room of shadows.

17     INT. HALLWAY

     A LOW RUMBLE freezes GRADY
     as he enters the hail. A few feet away, Poe lies belly to 
     the ground, his blind blue eyes trained, more or less, in 
     Grady's direction.

                         GRADY
          Okay. Easy now. Eee-zy. . . .

     GRADY starts to take a step, when.... Poe shoots forward 
     and sinks himself deep into Grady's ankle.

                         GRADY
          Jesus!

     GRADY hops gracelessly, momentarily lifting Poe off the 
     ground as he swings his leg up. Poe, countering, rolls his 
     head in a snapping motion and drops GRADY in a clumsy heap.

                         GRADY
          Get off of me, you son-of-a-bitch!

     Poe regains his feet, but doesn't let go, whipping his 
     head back and forth, back and forth, over and over, 
     growling low, dark, and hideously from the back of his 
     throat, until there is a sharp...

     CRACK! CRACK!

     Poe YELPS, goes perfectly still, then topples heavily 
     onto Grady's legs. GRADY
     turns. James Leer stands in the doorway, posed with the 
     little pearl-handled pistol like Steve McQueen.

     GRADY looks at James. Then Poe. Then back to James.

                         GRADY
          Shit, James. You shoe Dr. Gaskell's dog.

                         JAMES LEER 
          I had to. Didn't I?

                         GRADY
          Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?

                         JAMES LEER
          No! He was crazy. I didn't-he looked-- 1 
          thought --

                         GRADY
          Okay, okay. Take it easy. Don't freak out on 
          me.

     GRADY roils down his sock. Apparently, Poe went through 
     life with a slight overbite.

                         JAMES LEER
          Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see 
          if someone's breathing.

                         GRADY
          He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead 
          dog when I see one.

     James looks miserably at Poe.

                         JAMES LEER
          What are we going to do?

     GRADY rises awkwardly, holds out his hand.

                         GRADY
          First you're going to give me that little cap 
          gun of yours.

18     INT. GALAXIE - MOVING 

     GRADY and James stare gloomily out the windshield.

                         JAMES LEER
          Professor Tripp? Can I  ask you a question?

                         GRADY
          Yea, James.

                         JAMES LEER 
          What are we going to do with...

     James glances in the backseat, where Poe lies, strange 
     blue eyes gleaming.

                         GRADY
          I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out 
          how to tell the Chancellor I murdered her 
          husband's dog.

                         JAMES LEER
          You?

                         GRADY
          Trust me, James, when the family pet's been 
          assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear 
          one of her students was the triggerman.

                         JAMES LEER
          Does she want to hear it was one of her 
          professors?

                         GRADY
          I've got tenure.

19     EXT. PARKING LOT -- THAW HALL (CAMPUS) 

     As sporadic APPLAUSE wafts from the high windowpanes of 
     Thaw Hall, GRADY leans into the Galaxie's trunk, creates a 
     space between the tuba and a ZIPPERED SUITCASE.

                         GRADY
          Okay.

     James totters forward, arms hooked under Poe's front legs 
     looking like a sorry marathon dancer. GRADY frowns, limps 
     forward, and takes the hind legs.

                         JAMES LEER
          He's still a little warm.

     They lay him down, push him deep into the trunk--until 
     there is a SOUND like a pencil SNAPPING.

                         JAMES LEER 
          Yuck.

     GRADY grabs Crabtree's garment bag, frisks the pockets.

                         JAMES LEER 
          That's a. big trunk. It fits a tuba, a 
          suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost 
          perfectly.

                         GRADY
               (searching)
          That's just what they used to say in the ads. 
          Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...

                         JAMES LEER
          Whose tuba is that anyway? 

                         GRADY
          Miss Sloviak's.

                         JAMES LEER
          Can I ask you something about her?

                         GRADY
          She is. Ah. Here we go...

     GRADY unravels a pair of boxer shorts, finds an airplane-
     size bottle of JACK DANIELS, then grabs another pair of 
     boxers.

                         JAMES LEER
          Oh. So. Is--is your friend Crabtree-- is he--
          gay?

                         GRADY
          Most of the time he is, James. Some of the 
          time he isn't. Now what do we have here?

     GRADY rattles a prescription bottle, then shakes out a 
     pair of WHITE PILLS, each etched with a tiny numeral 3.

                         GRADY
          Looks like ...our old friend Mr. Codeine. That 
          should take the pinch out of my ankle.
               (handing the bottle to James) 
          Have one.

                         JAMES LEER
          No thanks. I'm fine without them.

                         GRADY
          Right. That's why you were standing in the 
          Chancellor's back yard twirling that little cap 
          gun of yours tonight.  You're fine, all right, 
          you're fit as a fucking fiddle.

     GRADY opens the tiny bottle of Jack with his teeth, 
     drinks down two number 3's, then looks at James.

                         GRADY
          I'm sorry, James. I'm sorry I said that.

     Recklessly, James takes a pill, tosses it in his mouth, 
     and tips back the tiny bottle of Jack. Half a second later, 
     he spits it all out. GRADY looks down, peels the soggy pill 
     from the lapel of his jacket.

                         GRADY
          How 'bout we try that again.

20     INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER

     On the stage. Walter Gaskell stands alone at a podium.

                         WALTER
          ...really needs no introduction. Walk down the 
          aisle of any airplane or by the pool of any 
          hotel and you'll see his face beaming back at 
          you. You all know the name, you all know the 
          books, so welcome if you will, the man those of 
          us who know him simply call.. .Q.

     As the audience THUNDERS, GRADY and James slink into the 
     auditorium. It's standing room only. As they head for an 
     open space against the back wail, GRADY squeezes past a KID 
     with a GOATEE .who regards him warily.
 
                         Q 
          Good evening.

     GRADY stares, over the gleaming sea of heads before him, 
     watching as Q pauses, ..for a very long moment... waiting 
     until the auditorium is consumed in a heavy, anticipatory 
     hush. Finally, he speaks again.

                         Q 
          I am a writer.

     As the audience EXPLODES with glee, GRADY frowns. He 
     glances to his right, sees James' left brow crinkled with a 
     similar look of bafflement.

                         Q (cont'd)
          As a writer, one thing you learn is that 
          everyone you encounter has a story. Every 
          bartender, every taxi driver, everybody has an 
          idea or a. story that would make a "great book" 
          or a "great movie." Presumably, each of you has 
          an idea. (gestures to the audience)
          But, how do you go from there to here? How do 
          you go from having an idea to having a book? 
          How do you get across? What is the bridge, the 
          bridge that allows you to walk on air from the 
          shoreline of inspiration to the terra firma of 
          accomplishment? Faith. Faith that your story is 
          worth the telling, faith that you have the 
          wherewithal to tell it, faith that the 
          carefully woven structure you create won't 
          collapse beneath you...

     GRADY glances at James, sees that his eyes are unblinking 
     and glazed, then sees, beyond him, Sara standing by the far 
     EXIT. A blink later, she is gone.

                         Q (cont'd)
          ...and faith that when you get to the other 
          side someone will be waiting who gives a damn 
          about the tale you have to tell.

     GRADY leans back, listening to the BEATING of his own 
     HEART, the soft GLIMMER of the chandeliers hanging by a 
     thread forty feet above his head...

     Abruptly, James LAUGHS OUT LOUD--some private amusement: 
     bubbling up from the bottom or his brain and out into the 
     auditorium. As Q looks and four hundred other heads turn, 
     James ducks down--mortified. Crabtree, sitting a few rows 
     away, studies James with amusement, then winks at Grady.

     GRADY blinks, turns to James.

                         GRADY
          I'll be right back.

21     INT. LOBBY

     GRADY bursts through the auditorium doors and into the 
     lobby. A PAIR. of local BOOKSELLERS, chatting quietly 
     behind a table arrayed with the BOOKS of attending authors, 
     glance up as GRADY limps toward the restrooms. 

22     INT. CORRIDOR  

     GRADY stumbles down the sloping carper, but the corridor 
     begins to turn sideways on him and he stops, resting his 
     cheek against the cool...cool...wall. ..as...ail..-goes....

     BLACK FOR A 

     MOMENT AND THEN....

                         SARA'S VOICE 
          Grady? Grady?

     GRADY opens his eyes, finds Sara's face swimming above 
     him. He is lying on his back in the corridor, his corduroy 
     blazer bundled under his head like a pillow.

                         SARA
          You had another one, didn't you? You have to 
          see a doctor, Grady. First thing Monday 
          morning. All right?

                         GRADY
          Is the thing-is it over?

                         SARA 
          Almost. Wane to sit up?
               (as he winces) 
          What's the matter?

                         GRADY
          Nothing. I think I twisted my--

     GRADY looks at his ankle and feels a rush of guilt.

                         GRADY
          I have to tell you something. Something.. 
          .hard.

     Sara's face stiffens, becomes more Chancelloresque.

                         SARA
          Then stand up. I'm too old for all this 
          roiling around on the floor.

     GRADY lets her pull him up, watches her light a 
     cigarette.

                         GRADY
          Well...

                         SARA
          Don't. I know what you're going to say.

                         GRADY
          No, really, Sara, I don't think you--

                         SARA
          You love Emily. I know that. And you need to 
          stay with her.

                         GRADY
          I don't think I really have a choice in, that. 
          Emily left me.

                         SARA
          She'll come back. That's why I'm going to. 
          ..to not have this baby.

     GRADY watches her flip her hand up, bring the cigarette 
     to her lips, and inhale ...then grimace and drop it to the 
     floor.

                         GRADY
          Not have it.

                         SARA
          No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think 
          there's no way?

                         GRADY
          Well, no, I don't see any way.
               (taking her hand)
          And I know how hard it is for you to-- to lose 
          this chance.

                         SARA
               (jerking away)
          No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. 
          And fuck you for "saying. . .
               (quietly)
          ...for saying there's just no way. Because 
          there could be a way, Grady.

     Somewhere deep in the building, APPLAUSE swells.

                         SARA
               (composing herself)
          He must be finishing. We should go.

     GRADY looks sadly at Sara then stoops to retrieve his 
     coat.  As he grabs it, James Leer's little pistol CLATTERS 
     to the floor.

                         SARA
          Who's gun is that?

                         GRADY
          It's-it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.

     Before GRADY can close his hand, Sara has it in her own.

                         SARA
          Heavy. Smells like gunpowder.

                         GRADY
          Caps.

     She points it-at Grady's chest. He smiles nervously.

                         SARA 
          Pow.

                         GRADY
          You got me.

                         SARA
          I love you, Grady.

     GRADY places his fingers gently over Sara's... and 
     removes the gun from her hand.

                         GRADY
          I love you, too.

23     INT. LOBBY 

     The auditorium doors swing open and James Leer emerges, 
     arms draped over CRABTREE and a LARGE STUDENT.

                         JAMES LEER
          Woah! The doors made so much noise!

     As they make for the restrooms, Sara and GRADY appear.

                         JAMES LEER
          This is so embarrassing! You guys had to carry 
          me out.

                         GRADY
          Is he ail right?

                         CRABTREE
               (rolling his eyes) 
          He's fine. He's narrating.

                         JAMES LEER 
          We're going to the men's room. Only we might 
          not make it in time.

                         SARA
          Terry CRABTREE and James Leer. Leave it to you 
          to make that mistake, wait here.

     As Sara heads off after James, GRADY turns toward the 
     lobby...directly into the hostile gaze of Miss Sloviak.

                         MISS SLOVIAK
          I need a ride.

                         GRADY
          I'm your man.

24     EXT. STREET 24

     As the Galaxie's big trunk yawns open. MISS SLOVIAK 
     stares at what's wedged up against her suitcase.

                         GRADY
          There's an explanation.

     MISS SLOVIAK raises an eyebrow and then, leaning in, 
     unzips her suitcase.

25     INT.    GRADY'S CAR - MOVING   

     As GRADY drives, MISS SLOVIAK finishes with the top 
     button of a man's shirt, then reaches into the zippered 
     COSMETICS BAG in her lap. Onto the open tray of the 
     glovebox, she places a JAR of COLD CREAM, a BOTTLE of NAIL 
     POLISH REMOVER, and a cloud of COTTON BALLS.

                         MISS SLOVIAK
          Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the 
          poor thing?

                         GRADY
          James is. ..I don't know...

                         MISS SLOVIAK
          Disturbed. And when your friend CRABTREE gets 
          done with him, he's going to be even more 
          disturbed.

                         GRADY
          I'm not sure that's possible.

                         MISS SLOVIAK
          Sure it is.

     GRADY watches MISS SLOVIAK peel the wig from her 
     forehead.

                         GRADY
          Listen, Antonia--

                         MISS SLOVIAK
          Tony. Now that I'm home.

                         GRADY
          Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so 
          well for you tonight. With Terry.

                         MISS SLOVIAK
          Forget it. I should've known better. Your 
          friend is just, I don't know, into collecting 
          weird tricks. Mind?

     Tony angles the rearview mirror toward himself.

                         GRADY
          He's writing his name in water.

                         MISS SLOVIAK
          What's that?

                         GRADY
          Like most editors, he really wants to be a 
          writer, but he's too busy living a novel to 
          bother writing one.

                         MISS SLOVIAK
          That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a 
          shit.

                         GRADY
          He'd call it habit. But now. ..I get the 
          feeling he's going through the motions a bit.

     Tony peels off a pair of false eyelashes, blinks.

                         MISS SLOVIAK
          You mean because his career's ruined and all?

                         GRADY
          Jesus. Is that what he told you?

                         MISS SLOVIAK
          He said he hasn't had a success in ten years 
          and everyone in New York thinks he's kind of 
          .a. . .

     As Tony re-sets the rearview mirror, GRADY gets a glimpse 
     of his own swollen eyes.

                         MISS SLOVIAK
          ...loser. But I'm sure your book is so good 
          that he'll be able to keep his job.

     Hearing this, GRADY looks troubled. MISS SLOVIAK points.

                         MISS SLOVIAK
               (cont'd) 
          Turn here.

26     EXT. SLOVIAK HOUSE

     GRADY pulls in front of a small brick house. On the front 
     lawn, a small statue of the BLESSED VIRGIN stands under a 
     little white BAND SHELL painted with stars.

                         GRADY
          That'' s nice. All we have is a Japanese 
          beetle trap.

                         MISS SLOVIAK
          It's a bathtub. What she's standing under.

     The PORCH LIGHT conies on and a SMALL, WHITE-HAIRED MAN 
     squints through the screen door.

                         MISS SLOVIAK
          There's Pop. 
               (turning)
          Let me see it. The gun.

     GRADY reaches into his pocket, hands it over. Tony 
     smirks.

                         MISS SLOVIAK
          Figures. It's like the kind of gun Bette Davis 
          would carry. In a little beaded purse?

     GRADY studies the gun in Tony's hand, then glances at the 
     front screen door. Pop is still there.

                         GRADY
          I'd better go. I think I may have to rescue 
          James Leer.

     MISS SLOVIAK returns the gun, .steps out of the car, and 
     peers in at Grady.

                         MISS SLOVIAK
          You know, Grady, if I were you. I'd think 
          about going home. You look like you need a 
          little rescuing yourself.

27     EXT. PARKING LOT - HI-HAT CLUB 

     GRADY parks near a VAN that has KRAVNIK'S SPORTING GOODS 
     stenciled on the side. He watches a BOUNCER frisk a patron 
     in the PINK LIGHT of the Hi-Hat Club's entrance, then 
     slides -James Leer's little PISTOL into the glovebox.

27A     EXT. ENTRANCE - HI-HAT CLUB     

     As GRADY steps to the door, the bouncer gives him a 
     perfunctory pat-down.

                         BOUNCER 
               (kidding him) 
          Clean tonight, hub, Professor?

                         GRADY
          As a whistle.

28     INT. HI-HAT CLUB

     Hannah Green is dancing with a sweat-drenched Q as GRADY 
     enters this SMOKE-FILLED RHYTHM AND BLUES club. She beckons 
     with a finger, but Grady--Nervous at the sight of her 
     glistening Mormon skin--merely pantomimes an exaggerated 
     shrug and she points.

     CRABTREE and James Leer sit at a dark corner table. James 
     slouches, eyes half-closed, while CRABTREE stares in the 
     general vicinity of the dancers, his hand extended beneath 
     the table, in the general vicinity of James' lap.

     Grady, looking a little alarmed, grabs a passing 
     WAITRESS.

                         GRADY
          Double Dickel on the rocks.

29     INT. BOOTH 

     As GRADY arrives, CRABTREE withdraws his hand delicately 
     and James' eyes flutter open .briefly, ..then close.

                         GRADY
          Is that just beer?

                         CRABTREE
          Primarily. Although I gather you two staged a 
          little raid on the CRABTREE pharmacopoeia. You 
          missed a few bottles, by the way.

                         GRADY
          I'm sure. Where is everyone?

                         CRABTREE
          Sara and Walter declined. Guess they wanted to 
          go home and curl up on the couch with the dog.

     GRADY cuts James a glance, trying to determine if he's 
     copped on Poe, but James is winking out. His head drifts 
     back against the wail, settles with a gentle ...thunk.

                         GRADY
          Jesus. He's out.

     CRABTREE glances over, nods.

                         CRABTREE
          He has a book.

                         GRADY
          I know. He started it Fall semester.

                         CRABTREE
          He finished it Winter Break.

     GRADY looks up, unable to disguise his surprise.  He 
     glances at James' slack face tilted against the wall.

                         CRABTREE
          So. Is he any good?

                         GRADY
          No. Not yet he isn't.

                         CRABTREE
          Well, I'm going to read it anyway.

                         GRADY
          Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's . one o£ 
          my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure 
          if he's-

                         CRABTREE
          He is. Take my word for it.

                         GRADY
          I think it's more complicated than that. 
          Besides, he's a little...scattered. He almost 
          ...did something stupid tonight. At least, I 
          think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual 
          confusion thrown into the stew right now.

                         CRABTREE
          On the contrary, it 'could be just the ticket.

                         WAITRESS 
               (ducking in) 
          Double Dickel.

                         GRADY
          Thanks.

     GRADY notices the waitress's nametag (OOLA) and realizes 
     she is conspicuously PREGNANT. He watches her disappear 
     beyond the blur of bodies on the dancefloor, where Hannah 
     Green's slinky form seizes his attention.

                         CRABTREE
          No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor?

                         GRADY
          Shut up and drink.

     CRABTREE grins, brings his bottle up, then stops.

                         CRABTREE
          Oh my goodness. Do you see what I see?

     GRADY follows Crabtree's glance and finds Oola again, but 
     it's not Oola CRABTREE
     is eyeing, it's her CUSTOMER.

                         GRADY 
          President of the James Brown Hair Club For 
          Men.

     Sitting alone in the dark booth is a SMALL BLACK MAN with 
     big hands, a face peppered with scar tissue, and--most 
     noticeably--a tsunami of hair sprouting from his scalp.

                         GRADY
               (initiating an old game) 
          He's a boxer. A flyweight.

                         CRABTREE
          Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis.. 
          .Curtis Hardapple.

                         GRADY
          Not Curtis.

                         CRABTREE
          Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are 
          from a--from a horse. He fell during a race and 
          got trampled.

                         GRADY
          And now he's addicted to painkillers.

                         CRABTREE
          He can't piss standing up anymore.

                         GRADY
          He lives with his mother.

                         CRABTREE
          And he had a younger brother who . . .was . . 
          . a. . .

                         GRADY
          Groom. Named Claudell.  And his mother blames 
          Vernon for his death.

                         CRABTREE
               (stumped)
          Because. . .because. . .

                         JAMES LEER 
               (sleepily)
          .. .he was killed, when a gangster named 
          Freddie Nostrils tried to shoot his favorite 
          horse. He took the bullet himself.

     GRADY and Crabtree turn to look at James Leer, who opens 
     one bloodshot eye to regard them.

                         JAMES LEER
          Vernon, over there, was in on the hit.

     James' eye closes. CRABTREE looks over at Grady.

                         CRABTREE
          That was good.

                         GRADY
          He heard everything we were saying.

     Just then, Hannah Green bounces up in her red boots.

                         HANNAH GREEN
          Come on. Teach. I want you to dance with me.

30     INT. DANCEFLOOR - MOMENTS LATER                          30

     GRADY and Hannah, reflected in bits and pieces in the 
     jack 'o lantern wail of MIRRORED TILE, slow-dance to a 
     sexy, measured blues.

                         HANNAH GREEN
          I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's 
          so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like ail 
          your sentences always existed, just waiting 
          around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to 
          fetch them down.

                         GRADY
          I thank you.

                         HANNAH GREEN
          And I love the inscription you wrote to me. 
          Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think 
          I am.

                         GRADY
          I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy 
          innocents we can get.

     GRADY spies the corner table, watches CRABTREE say 
     something to Q and then, casually, stroke a lock of hair 
     from James Leer's forehead.

                         HANNAH GREEN
          So what are you going to do?

                         GRADY
          Do?

                         HANNAH GREEN
          I just mean, I--I guess Emily isn't going to 
          be there when you get home.

     GRADY looks down into Hannah's translucent face, then 
     catches a glimpse of himself in the fractured, wail. The 
     tile that would reflect his head is missing.

                         GRADY
          Are you holding me up or am I dragging you 
          down?

     Hannah snuggles closer, lays her head on Grady's chest.

                         HANNAH GREEN
          Shush.

31     EXT. PARKING LOT - HI-HAT CLUB (2 AM)       

     Grady, limping on his bad ankle, carries James to 
     Hannah's rumpled RENAULT, props him against the fender.

                         GRADY
          Look, Hannah. When you get him home ...make 
          sure he's ail right. Before you leave. Okay?

                         HANNAH GREEN
          I would if I knew where I was taking him.

                         GRADY
          Hannah, are you telling me you don't know 
          where James Leer lives?

                         HANNAH GREEN
          Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen 
          it.

                         GRADY
          That strikes me as odd.

                         HANNAH GREEN
          James is odd. I know he has an aunt in 
          Sewickley Heights. I dropped him there once, 
          but... 
               (remembering)
          Come to think of it, it-wasn't even his Aunt's 
          house. He said she worked there. Or something. 
          I don't remember.

     James MUMBLES, starts to slide onto the hood of the car.

                         JAMES LEER 
          Mmhmmm.. . . knap ...sap....

                         GRADY
          What's he saying?

                         HANNAH GREEN
          His bag. You know that ratty green thing he's 
          always carrying around. He must've left it 
          inside.

                         GRADY
          Hh-uh. Last time I saw it was...

     GRADY glances at the idling Galaxie across the street. 
     CRABTREE
     and Q huddle inside.

                         GRADY
          Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the 
          auditorium.

                         JAMES LEER
               (delirious, but insistent) 
          Mmrrmmm.. .KNAP SAP!

     GRADY frowns in annoyance, opens the passenger door.

                         GRADY (cont'd)
          All right. Take him to my place. He can crash 
          on the sofa.

                         HANNAH GREEN
          The one in your office? It's the best one .for 
          naps.

                         GRADY
          I don't think it really matters, Hannah. We 
          could probably stand him up in the garage with 
          the snow shovels at this point.

     As GRADY lowers James into the seat, he WHIMPERS, curls 
     into a bail. Hannah turns her puppy dog eyes on Grady.

                         GRADY
          Ail right. In my office.

     As GRADY starts to turn away, Hannah's fingers graze his 
     face.

                         HANNAH GREEN
          Hey. If you want to talk later...I'll be up.

     GRADY watches her fold her lovely self into the car and 
     drive away. He sighs, crosses to the Galaxie, and just has 
     his hand on the doorhandle when a TINY FIGURE appears.

     Vernon Hardapple.

                         VERNON HARDAPPLE 
          You driving this car?

                         GRADY
          Excuse me?

                         VERNON HARDAPPLE
          This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving 
          this car?

                         GRADY
          It's mine.

                         VERNON HARDAPPLE 
          Bullshit. It's mine, motherfucker.

                         GRADY
          You must be mistaken.

                         VERNON HARDAPPLE 
          Bullshit.

     GRADY shakes his head wearily, opens the door.

                         GRADY
          Go home to your mother, Vernon.

32     INT. GALAXIE      

     GRADY slides in next to Q, puts the car in gear, and 
     starts to pull away. As he glances in the rearview, he sees 
     CRABTREE smiling darkly in the backseat.

                         GRADY

          All right, what's the matter?

     CRABTREE just keeps smiling.

                         GRADY
          Christ, Crabs, what do you expect me to do? 
          The kid's practically in a coma.

                         CRABTREE
          Tripp.

                         GRADY
          Yes.

                         CRABTREE
          Hit your brakes.

     GRADY flicks his eyes from the rearview mirror just as a 
     SHADOW looms in his headlights. As he squashes the break 
     pedal, Q's EYEGLASSES go flying into the windshield.

                         Q 
               (squinting)
          Oh my God! What is that?

     It's Vernon, waving his arms, his shadow enormous in the 
     beams of light.

                         GRADY
          What's this guy's problem?

                         CRABTREE
          Just go around him.

     GRADY taps the accelerator, but each time, Vernon dances 
     back in front of Grady's grille.

                         GRADY
          Shit.

                         CRABTREE
          Back up. Go out the other way.

     GRADY throws the car in reverse, backs straight up, then 
     turns up a one-way street. He shoots down the alley behind 
     the Hi-Hat, turns onto the adjoining street, ..and watches 
     in amazement as Vernon materializes from behind the high 
     wooden fence that runs parallel to the Galaxie.

     As GRADY pinches the brakes, Vernon grins.

                         GRADY
          Now what?

                         Q
               (mischievously)
          You could always go over him.

     Then, as the three men watch, Vernon rocks back on his 
     heels and--with a gymnast's precision-pitches himself onto 
     the Galaxie's big hood. He -lands on his ass, slides 
     smoothly off, then takes a deep bow and disappears into the 
     night.

                         Q 
          What just happened?

     GRADY peers at the wrinkled asterisk on his hood.

                         GRADY
          I just had my car jumped on.

33     EXT. THAW HAIL - NIGHT (TWENTY MINUTES LATER) 

     Grady stops the car in the red zone and gets out.

                         GRADY
          Wait here. I'll be right back.

                         CRABTREE
          Where would we go?

34     INT. LOBBY   

     The JANITOR, the same shaggy-haired kid GRADY saw rigging 
     the WordFest banner earlier, is struggling with a balky 
     FLOOR WAXER as GRADY steps up to the double doors and slaps 
     his hand against the glass.

                         JANITOR 
          It's open.

     GRADY pushes on the door and it opens.

                         JANITOR (cont'd) 
          Hey, Professor Tripp. 
               (off Grady's look)
          Traxler. Sam. I took your class freshman year. 
          Then I dropped out of school.

                         GRADY
          I hope it wasn't my fault.

                         TRAXLER
               (taking him seriously)
          No. I guess you're here for the backpack. 

                         GRADY
          Oh.. .yeah.

35     INT. AUDITORIUM       

     The knapsack is sitting on one of the metal folding 
     chairs as Sam and GRADYenter the silent hail.


                         TRAXLER
          I saw the manuscript inside. So when you 
          showed up, I figured. . .

     GRADY lifts the knapsack, peers inside. There is no title 
     page to the MANUSCRIPT, Just the words The Love Parade and 
     then, halfway down, TEXT.

                         TRAXLER 
          Is it good?

                         GRADY
               (reading)
          I don't know. It might be...

36     CUT

37     EXT. THAW HALL - NIGHT - A MOMENT LATER 

     GRADY steps outside, closes the flap of the knapsack and, 
     hunching his shoulders against the cold... stops.

     Crabtree. Q. The car. Gone. 

38     INT. TRAXLER'S HONDA - NIGHT   

     Traxler gives GRADY a ride in his Honda, one of the 
     original Hondas best suited for sidewalk driving. The 
     backseat bulges with a huge AMPLIFIER and BASS GUITAR.

                         TRAXLER
          Say, Professor Tripp, is ail that stuff true 
          about Errol Flynn? How he used to put coke on 
          his dick. To make himself, you know, like, last 
          longer?

                         GRADY
          Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?

                         TRAXLER 
          Well, jeez, you're reading his biography, 
          aren't you?

     Sam points and GRADY glances at the knapsack riding on 
     the seat between him and Sam. A BOOK'-bearing ERROL FLYNN'S 
     PICTURE--IS tucked into the side pouch.

                         GRADY
          Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. He used to rub 
          ail kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground 
          lamb.

                         TRAXLER 
          Sick.

39     EXT. SASKELL'S HOUSE - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)

     Sam brings the car to a coughing idle across the street 
     from the Gaskell's house.

                         TRAXLER
          Wow, check out that greenhouse. Is that your 
          wife?

     GRADY gazes at Sara, a .vaporous blur in the greenhouse.

                         GRADY
          No, my wife's out of town.

     Just then, the Honda FILLS WITH LIGHT. HEADLIGHTS loom, 
     then a POLICE CAR sweeps into the Gaskell's driveway. 
     Walter appears on the front steps.

                         TRAXLER (cont'd) 
          Who's that guy?

                         GRADY
          Her husband.

     Traxler looks anxiously at the police car.

                         TRAXLER
          What exactly are we doing here, Professor 
          Tripp?

                         GRADY
               (staring at Sara) 
          Taking the long way home.

39A     EXT. GRADY'S HOUSE - NIGHT - A LITTLE LATER

     As Traxler drives away, GRADY mounts the porch with James 
     Leer's knapsack hanging from one shoulder. He reaches above 
     the door, feeling for a key, but his fingers come away with 
     only dust. He stands, dispirited, then an idea strikes. He 
     takes the doorknob, turns it. It opens.

40     INT. .HALLWAY - GRADY'S HOUSE

     GRADY enters, closes the door quietly behind him.

41     INT. LIVING ROOM     

     The room is dim but the TV is on, throwing crazy slashes 
     of light onto the wails and ceiling. As GRADY limps by, he 
     finds a sleeping Hannah Green, bundled in a blanket, T-
     shirt, and little else. On the floor, near her dangling 
     hand, Woolf's A Common Reader lays open next to a Diet 
     Coke. GRADY considers the smooth geography of her body, but 
     his eyes 'are most powerfully drawn to. ..her feet. He 
     steps forward, lifts the blanket gently, but finds-to his 
     disappointment--only the red cowboy boots.

     He picks up the remote, turns off the TV, and exits.

42     INT. GRADY'S OFFICE

     James Leer slumbers on a green sofa, draped in an old 
     sleeping bag. GRADY drops behind his desk, lets James' 
     knapsack slide to the floor. He lifts his cuff, inspects 
     his ugly ankle, then glimpses something in the knapsack.

     Something yellow. Something soft.

     GRADY reaches down and, slowly--like a magician producing 
     a magical scarf-extracts MARILYN MONROE'S WEDDING JACKET 
     from James Leer's ratty green knapsack. 

     GRADY glances at the young man on his sofa, then, looking 
     very tired, reaches for the desk lamp ...and turns out the 
     light on the both of them.

43     EXT. FRONT PORCH - SATURDAY MORNING (NEXT DAY) 

     GRADY steps outside in a WOMAN'S CHENILLE BATHROBE and 
     plucks the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette from the second porch 
     step. He fishes out a charred ROACH, starts to light it, 
     then notices the Galaxie sitting in the driveway.

44     INT. GUEST BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER     

     As CRABTREE SNORES thunderously, GRADY eases open the 
     door, spots the CAR KEYS on the dresser, grabs them.

44A     INT. LANDING - CONTINUOUS

     GRADY eases the door shut, starts to turn, then stops, 
     his eyes drawn to the door just across the landing from 
     Crabtree's room.

44B     INT. EMILY'S OFFICE 

     GRADY pushes open the door with the tips of his fingers, 
     lets it glide open. The room that is revealed is bright and 
     well-ordered, in direct contrast to the lazy clutter of 
     Grady's office. There is a DRAFTING TABLE and a COMPUTER, 
     pads and pens neatly arranged alongside.

     A BULLITEN BOARD hangs on one wall, bearing an intricate 
     mosaic of multi-colored index cards. There are PRINTS, 
     framed, from various art exhibits, and two of Grady's 
     DHSTJACKETS--including, most prominently, Arsonist's 
     Daughter.

     There are PHOTOGRAPHS of EMILY too. In a black turtleneck 
     with friends. In a sundress with Grady. In a billowing 
     Burberry, floating like a dark butterfly against a BLUR of 
     YELLOW TAXIS on a street in Manhattan.

     Smiling brilliantly. Beautiful.

45     INT. GRADY'S OFFICE

     GRADY enters with a THERMOS--pauses--redistributes the 
     sleeping bag over James Leer's pale body.

                         JAMES LEER 
               (without waking) 
          Thank you.

                         GRADY
          You're welcome.

     GRADY sits at his desk, pours himself a cup of coffee 
     from the thermos, then sets the cup directly in the center 
     of a galaxy of previous coffee rings. Next, he takes a 
     clean piece of paper, balls it up, and-with ritual 
     precision-strokes it into the MINIATURE BASKETBALL HOOP 
     that crowns the rim of the WASTE BASKET across the room.

     All net.

     A 9-VOLT CROWD ROAR belches from the hoop and, without 
     further ceremony, GRADY
     turns to the blank page curling from his IBM SELECTRIC 
     and SPACES to the top right corner, TYPES:

          (beat) 2611

     In other words: Page 2611.

     CLOSE UP - THE TYPEWRITER PAPER -- darkening with WORDS, 
     the KEYS SNAPPING faster and faster, a CRAZY CLAMOR that 
     grows and grows until, finally, it just ....Stops.

                         GRADY
          James I  

     GRADY awakes with his back to the floor, James leer's 
     quizzical face floating like a cloud above him.

                         GRADY
          I'm okay. I just lost my balance.

                         JAMES LEER 
          I put you on the floor.

                         GRADY
          Oh.

                         JAMES LEER
          I thought you might--l don't know-- swallow 
          your tongue or something.
               (nodding to Grady's robe)
          I guess you really miss her, huh?

     GRADY peers down at the geraniums blooming on the pockets 
     of the robe, its overall fuzziness.

                         GRADY
          Huh? Oh, no. This isn't Emily's. I just write 
          in it.

                         JAMES LEER
          I guess there's probably a story behind that.

                         GRADY
          There is, but it's not that interesting.

     James nods. Down the hallway, in another room, the 
     TELEPHONE RINGS.

                         JAMES LEER 
          Want me to get that?

                         GRADY
          Sure.

     As James shuffles away in the sleeping bag, GRADY rises 
     delicately and turns toward the window, ..just in time to 
     see a POLICE CAR roil slowly by on the screen below.

                         JAMES LEER 
               (returning)
          He didn't give his name.

                         GRADY
          Who?

                         JAMES LEER 
          The guy on the phone.

                         GRADY
          What'd he say?

                         JAMES LEER
          He wanted to know if a GRADY Trip? lived here 
          and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 
          with black interior.

                         GRADY
          What'd you tell him?

                         JAMES LEER
          Yes.

                         GRADY
          Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be 
          sure to mention the back door pops open with a 
          couple hard shakes to the right.

                         JAMES LEER
          I thought maybe you'd won a radio contest or 
          something. Is that single-spaced?

     James has noticed the towering stack of 20 Ib. bond on 
     Grady's desk.

                         GRADY
          Afraid so.

                         JAMES LEER
          That's a big book you're writing.

                         GRADY
          I think it's sort of writing itself at this 
          point.

                         JAMES LEER
          Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, 
          but--

                         GRADY
          But . . . ?

                         JAMES LEER
          Nothing, it's just that,, well, it's been 
          awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some 
          people--some of the kids in workshop--thought 
          maybe you were...

                         GRADY
          Washed up?

                         JAMES LEER 
          Blocked.

                         GRADY
          Ah. I don't believe in writer's block.

     James takes another glance at the mammoth manuscript.

                         JAMES LEER
          No kidding.

     A LOUD HACKING is HEARD. GRADY and James turn, watch 
     Crabtree, wearing only a pair of striped boxers, 
     materialize in the hallway.

                         CRABTREE
          Good morning, boys. James.

     James waves feebly from beneath the sleeping bag.

                         GRADY
               (re: James' "attire") 
          If-you 're planning on staying for breakfast, 
          I'd put on something a little less comfortable 
          if I were you.

     As GRADY moves to his desk to reacquaint himself with the 
     page curling from the typewriter, James continues to stare 
     into the emptiness of the hallway. The sight of CRABTREE 
     seems to have made him suddenly queasy.

                         JAMES LEER 
          Professor Tripp?

                         GRADY
          Hm.

                         JAMES LEER 
          How did I get here last night?

                         GRADY
          No one seems to know where you live, James. 
          Hannah thought you'd like my couch.

                         JAMES LEER
          And ...and before that. Did I do anything? 
          Anything bad?

                         GRADY
          Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the 
          English Department's dog and steal his most 
          prized piece of memorabilia.

     As James contemplates this, the DOORBELL RINGS. GRADY 
     looks up, sees the POLICE CAR he noticed earlier, now 
     parked at the bottom of his driveway.

                         GRADY
          Do yourself a favor, James ...Hide.

46     EXT. FRONT PORCH

     A POLICEMAN not much older than James Leer waits. As the 
     door opens, GRADY
     appears.

                         OFFICER PUPCIK
          Good morning... 
               (eyeing Grady's robe)
          Professor Tripp? Sorry to bother you, sir, but 
          I understand you attended an event at Sara and 
          Walter Gaskell's house last night and were one 
          of the last to leave...

47     INT. LANDING - SAME TIME                                  47

     James lurks at the top of the stairs, swaddled in the 
     sleeping bag, straining to hear.

                         OFFICER PUPCIK (O.S.)
          ...was just wondering if maybe you saw anyone. 
          Someone you didn't know. Who seemed out of 
          place. Suspicious maybe...

48     EXT. FRONT PORCH 

     GRADY is  scratching his head in mock thought.

                         GRADY
          Well, there's always people you don't know at 
          these things, but I can't say there was anybody 
          particularly suspicious. ..Wait. There was one 
          guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey.

                         OFFICER PUPCIK 
          A jockey? You mean, like--

                         GRADY
          Horses, right. Vernon something...
               (thinking... )
          Hardpple

     Pupcik stops on his pad, looks up.

                         OFFICER PUPCIK 
          Hardapple?

                         GRADY
          I could be wrong. What happened anyway?

                         OFFICER PUPCIK
          Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's 
          closet. And the dog's missing.

                         GRADY
          That's weird.

                         OFFICER PUPCIK
          We figure the perpetrator let him out. He's 
          blind and we figure he just wandered off and 
          got run over.

                         GRADY
          The perpetrator.

                         OFFICER PUPCIK
          No, the dog.

                         GRADY
          Just kidding.

     Pupcik nods slowly, as if re-filing GRADY under "Dealing 
     With Assholes."

                         OFFICER PUPCIK
          One other thing. About this kid, this student 
          of yours- Leer--James Leer. You wouldn't know 
          how I could get in touch with him, would you?

                         GRADY
          I might have his number on campus.

                         OFFICER PUPCIK 
          That's all right. We'll find him.

     Pete Pupcik smiles, tips his big blue police hat, and 
     turns away. GRADY frowns, starts to close the door...

                         HANNAH GREEN (O.S.) 
          There you are...

     GRADY stiffens, then turns to find Hannah Green across 
     the room in her t-shirt and cowboy boots, looking ail dewy-
     eyed and delectable.

                         HANNAH GREEN
          I thought we were going to talk. Last night.

                         GRADY
          Oh. Well. I...

     Hannah stretches and the t-shirt slides dangerously up 
     her thighs.

                         HANNAH GREEN
          It's okay. ..I'm here when you want me.

     GRADY stands frozen as Hannah smiles sleepily, pushes 
     through the swinging door into the kitchen. A THUMPING is 
     heard as James, tangled in the sleeping bag, hitches down 
     the last few steps of the stairway. He watches Pete Pupcik 
     drive away in his big police car.

                         JAMES LEER 
          What do we do now?

#####Before GRADY can reply, .the TELEPHONE sitting on the table next to him 
#####RINGS.

                         GRADY
          Hello?

                         SARA'S VOICE
          Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You 
          won't believe what's happened.

                         GRADY
          Could you hold on a minute, honey?

     With a look of wonderment, GRADY watches his hand ever-
     so- gently ...hang up the phone.

                         GRADY
          How 'bout we get the hell out of here?

49     EXT. GRADY'S HOUSE - MORNING (MOMENTS LATER) 

     James, now wearing one of Grady's flannel shirts beneath 
     his ratty overcoat, follows Grady-to the Galaxie, knapsack 
     swinging from his shoulder. GRADY tosses him a ring of 
     KEYS.

                         GRADY
          You start her up.

     As GRADY runs a plastic WEDGE over the GLAZE of ice 
     blanketing the windshield, James stares curiously at the 
     keys, as if they were some strange artifact, then slides 
     behind the steering wheel.

                         JAMES LEER
               (as the engine roars) 
          How's that?

                         GRADY
          Well done, James.

     As GRADY works, James' face comes into view, then ...the 
     wedge SNAPS, splintering into the flesh of Grady's hand.

                         GRADY (cont'd) 
          Shit!

     James blinks, pokes his head out the window.

                         JAMES LEER
          You're bleeding. Professor Tripp.

50     INT. AISLE - MARKET - MORNING (LATER)   

     GRADY and James stand in the sundries aisle of a 
     neighborhood MARKET. GRADY
     has a TIN of BAND-AIDS open and is presently plastering 
     his ragged thumb.

                         GRADY
          Where exactly do you live, James?

     James, in the midst of chugging from a 64-OUNCE JUG of 
     ORANGE JUICE, stops.

                         GRADY
          Apparently not even Hannah Green has a clue as 
          to the location of your apartment.

     GRADY tosses the tin of band-aids into a small plastic 
     hand basket, begins to move down the aisle.

                         JAMES LEER
          I got kicked out. Well, not exactly kicked 
          out. I was asked to leave.

                         GRADY
          I guess there's probably a story behind that.

                         JAMES LEER
          There is, but it's not that interesting.

                         GRADY
          So where have you been staying?

                         JAMES LEER 
               (a long pause) 
          The bus station.

     GRADY stares incredulously at James.

                         JAMES LEER
          It's not -so bad. I know the night janitor. 
          And there's a broken locker I can put my stuff.

                         GRADY
               (trying to fathom this) 
          But James. I mean. ..How long?

                         JAMES LEER
          A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had 
          the gun. For protection.

                         GRADY
          Jesus, James, you should've told someone.

                         JAMES LEER 
          Who?

                         GRADY
          I don't know...
               (unconvincingly)
          Me.

     GRADY drops the basket at the check-out counter and, 
     abruptly, finds himself face to face with a BABY, lolling 
     on the shoulder of the woman before him. The baby is 
     staring, spellbound, at a display of...Q'S LATEST 
     PAPERBACK. GRADY
     frowns, then detects the true source of enchantment: a 
     spray of SHINY MYLAR GIFT BALLOONS.

     A thought evolves.

                         GRADY (cont'd)
               (the balloons)
          What do you think of these?

     James takes another chug from his jug, nods.

                         JAMES LEER 
          Nice.

51     EXT. GASKELL HOUSE - MORNING 

     Grady, squinting through the ten-inch panel of cleared 
     ice on the windshield, roils slowly up onto the curb in 
     front of Walter and Sara Gaskell's house ...then off.

52     INT. GALAXIE - CONTINUOUS  

     GRADY pops the glovebox, takes out a PEN, and scratches 
     something on the GIFT CARD attached to the BALLOON. James 
     glances briefly at a plump ZIPLOC OF POT stashed in the 
     glovebox, then peers at the house.

                         JAMES LEER 
               (the house) 
          Isn't this...?

                         GRADY
          Hm.

     GRADY gets out, then pauses, glancing at the giant orange 
     juice jug between James legs. It's about half-down.

                         GRADY
          You better ease off that stuff, James. It's 
          pretty acidic.

     James takes a powdered donut that lies on his coat, 
     studies it curiously.

                         JAMES LEER
          I can't help myself. I don't know what's the 
          matter with me.

                         GRADY
          Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you 
          think's the matter with you?

     As GRADY turns away, James ponders this, then considers 
     the ring of white sugar imprinted on his coat and re-sets 
     the donut in precisely the same place.

53     INT. GREENHOUSE - MOMENT LATER

     Through the steamy panes, we SEE GRADY approach with the 
     balloon, enter. He crosses to a high table, sets the 
     balloon down, and steps back, considering the placement.

                         SARA O.S.) 
          Feeling guilty?

     GRADY jumps--startled--and turns. Sara has materialized 
     behind a ficus, large POTTING GLOVES on her hands.

                         SARA (cont'd) 
          I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.

                         GRADY
          Totally.  I'm sorry. A lot was happening this 
          morning. Can you talk?

     Sara nods, moves the ficus to another table.

                         SARA
          Walter's on campus, being the good soldier for 
          WordFest. But he's a basket case. Someone stole 
          Marilyn's jacket last night. And Poe's missing, 
          too.

                         GRADY
          I-heard.

                         SARA 
          You heard? How?

                         GRADY
          A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house 
          this morning.

                         SARA 
          Did you confess?

     GRADY looks up, mildly alarmed.

                         SARA
          Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.

                         GRADY 
          Really? That was fast.

                         SARA 
               (frowning)
          I'm kidding. Hello?

                         GRADY
          Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There 
          is something I need to tell...

                         SARA
          Are you limping? Why are you limping?

                         GRADY
          Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to . 
          . .

                         SARA
          Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall 
          somewhere?

                         GRADY
          No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I 
          don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell 
          you something.

                         SARA 
          All right.

     Sara settles back, folds her arms. Waiting.

                         GRADY
          I...

     As GRADY stares into Sara's eyes, things begin to blur. 

                         GRADY (cont'd)
           ...want to be with you.

     Sara looks at him.

                         SARA
          Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt.  I 
          don't know whether to swoon or smirk.

                         GRADY
          Really, Sara, I...

     Sara holds up one gloved hand.

                         SARA
          I believe you. I believe you want to be with 
          me. But this is not just about me anymore.

                         GRADY
          I know that. I know what's at stake here...

                         SARA
          No, I don't think you do. And besides... I 
          haven't decided yet.

                         GRADY
          About the baby.

                         SARA 
          That ...and you.

     GRADY goes still, watches Sara strip off the gloves, drop 
     them on  a table.

                         SARA
          I'm not going to draw the map for you on this 
          one, Grady. Times like these you have to do 
          your own navigating.

     Sara turns to leave, then stops, squinting far down the 
     street.

                         SARA
          Who's that sitting in your car?

                         GRADY
          James Leer.

                         SARA 
          What's he doing out there?

                         GRADY
          I'm sort of helping him work through some 
          issues.

     Sara raises an eyebrow, then pushes through the door.

                         SARA 
          Isn't he lucky.

     GRADY watches her ripple across the glass, head for the 
     house, and wave. James, slumped low in the Galaxie, offers 
     a limp hand in return, but it's too late.

     She's already gone.

54     INT. GALAXIE - MOVING - LATER 54

     GRADY cradles the wheel in his bandaged paw, while James 
     sits stiffly, the orange juice jug bobbing between his 
     thighs.

                         JAMES LEER
          She seemed to take it pretty well.

                         GRADY
          Yeah, well, actually. . .

     James looks over.

                         GRADY (cont'd) 
          The moment didn't really present itself.

     James nods, unsurprised, then turns back to the window, 
     staring at the landscape, still sitting oddly still. GRADY 
     glances at him. At the orange juice jug.

                         GRADY (cont'd)
          You' re not planning on puking in my car, are 
          you, James?

     Nothing.

                         GRADY
          Don't be proud, James. We're in Sewickley 
          Heights. We could find you a nice golf course 
          to barf on.

                         JAMES LEER 
               (sharply) 
          No.

     GRADY looks over, surprised by the James' tone. James 
     blinks, looks embarrassed.

                         JAMES LEER (cont'd) 
          I mean. I'm fine. I'm sorry. I just...

     James peers out the window at passing landscape.

                         JAMES LEER (cont'd)
          I've got a thing about, ..places like this. I 
          know what those houses are like. I know what 
          the people are like.

                         GRADY
          Your aunt ?

     James turns, eyes flashing with surprise.

                         GRADY (cont'd)
          Hannah mentioned something about an aunt.

     James nods vaguely, then reaches into the ashtray, takes 
     a JOINT between his fingers, sniffs it.

                         JAMES LEER 
          Humboldt County?

                         GRADY
               (surprised)
          Maybe...

                         JAMES LEER
          It's my father. He gets it from his doctor.

                         GRADY
          Glaucoma?

                         JAMES LEER 
          Colon cancer.

                         GRADY
          Jesus, James. Wow.

     James puts the joint back in the ashtray.

                         JAMES' LEER
          It's a bit of a scandal. My parents live in a 
          small town.

                         GRADY
          Where's that?

                         JAMES LEER
          Carvel.

                         GRADY
          Carvel? Where's Carvel?

                         JAMES LEER 
          Outside Scranton.

                         GRADY
          I never heard of it.

                         JAMES LEER
          It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin 
          factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five 
          years.

                         GRADY
          Your father worked in a mannequin factory?

                         JAMES LEER
          Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my morn. 
          She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before 
          that, she'd been a dancer.

                         GRADY
          What kind of dancer? .

                         JAMES LEER
          Whatever kind they wanted her to be.

                         GRADY 
               (in disbelief)
          James Leer, are you telling me your mother was 
          a stripper?

                         JAMES LEER
          I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. 
          And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's 
          clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a 
          bad debt.

                         GRADY
          Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic 
          school?

                         JAMES LEER 
          When we fall, we fall hard.

                         GRADY
          Amazing.

     GRADY takes the joint from the ashtray, lights it, then 
     notices-with surprise--James has his hand out.

                         GRADY (cont'd) 
          I thought you were the guy who didn't like to 
          lose control of his emotions.

                         JAMES LEER
          Maybe I just needed the moment to present 
          itself.

55     EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD (KINSHIP) - DAY .(ONE HOUR LATER)

     GRADY glides down the graceful, tree-lined streets of a 
     modest, but well-kept neighborhood. James still has the 
     JOINT-now only a tiny nub-pinched between his fingers.

                         JAMES LEER
          This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy 
          would live. What's it called again?

                         GRADY
          Kinship.

                         JAMES LEER
          Kinship. And what's here?

                         GRADY
          Unless I miss my bet...my wife.

     James' heavy eyelids flutter with surprise.

                         JAMES LEER 
          The one that left you?

                         GRADY
          That's right. That one.

56     EXT. FRONT PORCH - WINTERS FAMILY HOUSE

     GRADY RAPS on the front door, then cups his hands against 
     the glass of the living room window, squints inside. 
     Nothing. As he turns away, GRADY sees James sitting on the 
     hood of the Galaxie with the box of powdered donuts. He's 
     sitting in the indentation.


                         JAMES LEER
          Someone jumped on your car with their butt ..-

                         GRADY
          How can you tell?

                         JAMES LEER
          You can see the outline of a butt.

     As GRADY nods, James holds out the donut box.

                         JAMES LEER (cont'd)
          Want one. They're incredible. Incredible.

                         GRADY
          Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you 
          can start on the box.

58     EXT. BACK PORCH - BACK YARD (MOMENTS LATER)

     As GRADY steps onto the back porch, James follows.

                         JAMES LEER
          Maybe she didn't come here.

                         GRADY
          She came here. We'll just wait. In the 
          meantime, I need you to shimmy through.

     James stares at the "Doggy Door" cut into the back porch 
     door.

                         GRADY
          Relax. Emily hasn't carried a house key since 
          she was twelve years old. And your hips are as 
          slim as hers.

                         JAMES LEER
          It's not that. It just reminded me of-- you 
          know-of what's in the car. In the trunk.

                         GRADY
               (a pang of guilt himself)
          Oh. Right. Well, let's try not to think about 
          that.

     James takes another sad glance at the little door, then 
     drops onto ail fours.

59     INT. LIVING ROOM - WINTERS HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER     

     GRADY leads James through the house. Everything about it 
     speaks of family. Even the furniture seems arranged so that 
     people will gather together, light a fire, talk.

                         JAMES LEER 
          It feels really... good. ..here.

                         GRADY
          I know. It's the house you want to wake up in 
          on Christmas morning.
               (moving off)
          Make yourself at home. I'll be right back.

60     INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM 60

     Grady, laboring badly on his ankle", enters and finds a 
     DUFFEL BAG open on the floor, its contents a tangle of 
     quickly-packed clothes. Everything else in the room feels 
     of another time. PHOTOGRAPHS are everywhere, documenting a 
     PRETTY GIRL'S life, from first recital to cap and gown.

     One photograph lies face down. GRADY turns it over and 
     finds the pretty girl grown into a beautiful young woman, 
     standing in a white gown next to a younger Grady--on their 
     wedding day.

61     INT. DEN     

     James enters, FRENCH ROLL in hand, and sees a REMOTE 
     CONTROL atop the BAR. Taking it, he points it at the WIDE- 
     SCREEN TELEVISION imbedded in the opposite wall and, 
     seconds later, GEORGE SANDERS walks into his CLOSE-UP.

                         GEORGE SANDERS
          There's no such thing as a good influence, Mr. 
          Gray. All influence is immoral...

62     INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - SAME TIME  

     Grady, a PINK PRINCESS PHONE to his ear, lies on the bed 
     next to a huge TEDDY BEAR.

                         GRADY
               (into phone)
          Yes, I' m looking for the Chancellor... I 
          don't know. She should be in the main hall 
          ...Thank you.

63     INT. DEN     

     James runs through the channels, pauses on MARTIN MILNER 
     and GEORGE MAHARIS, riding in their curvy Corvette.

64     INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - SAME TIME   

     A Nelson Riddle's THEME FROM ROUTE 66 BOOMS from below, 
     GRADY
     cups a hand over his ear.

                         GRADY
          Sara? Hi. It's Grady.

                         SARA'S VOICE
          Where are you, Grady? An elevator?

                         GRADY
          I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some 
          things we need to talk about...

                         SARA'S VOICE
               (evenly)
          You're in Kinship?

                         GRADY
          Yes. But that's not why I called...

                         SARA'S VOICE
          With Emily?

                         GRADY
          What? No'. There's no one here. I'm just 
          ...just....

                         SARA'S VOICE
          Just what? Doing a little dusting?

     As GRADY endeavors to respond, TWO YOUTHFUL VOICES, 
     CHEERFULLY SINGING, rise from below.

                         CHEERFUL VOICES       
          Good Morning! Good Morning!

                         GRADY
               (yelling)
          James! For Christ sake, will you turn that 
          thing down!

                         SARA'S VOICE
          James? He's still with you?

65     INT. DEN 

     James, in the midst of pouring himself a tumbler of 
     Bushmills, smiles as JUDY GARLAND and MICKEY ROONEY sing 
     their hearts out in Babes In Arms.

                         JUDY/MICKEY
          We talked the whole night through!

66     INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM 

     GRADY shakes his head, carries the phone toward the 
     bedroom WINDOW.

                         GRADY
          Look, Sara. ..I'm not here. ..I'm not here to 
          . . .

     As GRADY watches, a late-model PONTIAC BONNEVIlLE turns 
     into the driveway below him.

                         GRADY (cont'd)
           ...reconcile with Emily.

                         SARA'S VOICE
          Are you there to not reconcile with her?

     The Bonneville's trunk pops open, revealing THREE BAGS OF 
     GROCERIES, and HANK and IRENE WINTERS, both in their 60's, 
     get out. An enormous NEWFOUNDLAND vaults from the backseat.

     Sara, eating phone static this whole time, interprets 
     Grady's silence her own way.

                         SARA'S VOICE (cont'd) 
          Goodbye, Grady.

                         GRADY
          No. Sara, you don't understand...

                         SARA'S VOICE
          Trust me, I understand. I just want to say 
          something to you, Grady.

                         GRADY
               (dreading it) 
          Yea?

                         SARA'S VOICE
          How you choose to live your own life is your 
          business. But you be careful with that boy, 
          Grady. With James. He belongs to somebody else.

     As the line goes dead, GRADY watches Hank and Irene 
     Winters disappear below him.

69     INT. DEN       69

     James--Irish whiskey in one hand, the pride of Humboldt 
     County in the other--watches with deep absorption as Judy 
     and Mickey have a heartfelt conversation. Then, sensing 
     something ...he turns.

     Hank and Irene Winters, grocery bags in arm, stand 
     frozen.

                         JAMES LEER     
          Hullo.

     FOOTSTEPS are HEARD on the staircase and GRADY hobbies 
     into view. He tries a smile.

                         GRADY
          Mom. Dad.

70     INT. DEN - WINTERS HOUSE - (A BIT LATER) 

     Hank Winters emerges from the bathroom with a roll of 
     tape, a bottle of alcohol, and some cotton wool.

                         HANK
          Well, it's infected, I can tell you that. I'm 
          just going to clean it up a bit. It's up to you 
          to-find someone who knows what they're doing. 
          Here. Put your foot up.

     GRADY puts his foot up on Hank's lazy-Boy, then notices a 
     BOOK lying face down on the seat. The AUTHOR on the back 
     cover looks as if he's trying very hard to look 
     consequential. To his surprise, GRADY realizes the author 
     is himself.

                         HANK
          So he's one of your students, this boy?

     GRADY glances into the living room, where James and Irene 
     sit on a long couch together, sipping something hot. James 
     is looking out the window, a curious expression on his 
     face. GRADY looks out his own window, sees the Newfoundland 
     sniffing curiously at-the Galaxie's trunk. When he glances 
     back into the living room, he and James make brief eye 
     contact, then blink, look away.

                         GRADY
          Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed 
          up.

                         HANK
          Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll 
          be fine.

     GRADY tries to read Hank's face---is he messing with 
     him?--but Hank gives nothing away. GRADY nods to the book.

                         GRADY
          What made you pull out that old thing?

                         HANK
               (shrugging)
          I was thinking of you.

                         GRADY
          And?

                         HANK
          It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but I guess you 
          know that. It's a young man's book. It got me 
          remembering how it felt to be young.

                         GRADY
          Maybe I should read it.

                         HANK
          Oh, I don't think there's any danger of you 
          aging prematurely, Grady.

     GRADY doesn't have to read Hank's face this time.

                         GRADY
          Where's Emily, Hank?

                         HANK
          I 'don't know if she'd want me  to tell you 
          that, Grady.

                         GRADY
          I'm not going to stalk her. Hank. I just. 
          ..want to know where I stand.

     Hank looks up, incredulous.

                         HANK
          Where you stand?

                         GRADY
               (embarrassed)
          l-just want to say I'm sorry.

                         HANK
          She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The 
          neurologist.

                         GRADY
          Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?

                         HANK
               (frowning)
          Nothing's wrong. They went to Wellesley 
          together.

                         GRADY
               (sheepishly)
          Oh. Right. Linda ...I haven't been doing a lot 
          of sleeping lately. My editor's in town and I 
          have the book to finish and--

                         HANK
          Ah, right. The book.

     GRADY starts to continue, then stops, cowed by something 
     in Hank's tone, something dismissive. Instead, he looks 
     away, toward the living room, and catches sight of James 
     again, sitting alone now with his big cup of cocoa.

                         GRADY
          Listen, Hank, I'm sorry about ail this. I 
          didn't come here to upset you and Irene. I want 
          you to know that.

                         HANK
          Why did you come here, Grady?

     GRADY gestures vaguely.

                         GRADY
          I -just wanted to see her, I guess-- Emily. 
          And to see you too-you and Irene. And to let 
          everyone know that, even though it may be 
          difficult to comprehend now, this-everything 
          that's happening-it's not forever. It doesn't 
          mean "Goodbye."

                         HANK
          Give me a break, Grady.

     Hank snaps off the tape, slaps Grady's ankle.

                         HANK
          You're done.

71     INT. GALAXIE - MOVING - DUSK   71

     GRADY glowers darkly at the road, then puts his hand up 
     against the HEATING VENT which, apparently, is not putting 
     out any heat.

                         JAMES LEER
          I'm having a really good time, Professor 
          Tripp.

     GRADY glances over, sees James burrowing into the Ziploc.

                         GRADY
          I'm really happy for you, James. But do me a 
          favor, will you? Lay off my dope. That stuff's 
          not for amateurs.

     James looks at Ziploc as GRADY fiddles with the heat 
     LEVER.

                         JAMES LEER 
          I just wanted a little sip.

                         GRADY
               (squinting at him)
          I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James, 
          exactly what point was it that you turned into 
          Serpent Boy?

                         JAMES LEER
          Probably about the time you gave me the 
          codeine pills last night.

     GRADY stops with the heater, glances over at James, whose 
     face bears not the slightest trace of irony.

                         GRADY
          Jesus... 
               (thinking, then. . . )
          Look, James, you appear to possess-like many 
          an aspiring writer before you, by the way-a 
          rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which 
          dreams are made. However, I 'think it's best 
          if, for the moment at least
               (taking the Ziploc)
               ...we abstain.

                         JAMES LEER 
          You're mad at me, aren't you?

                         GRADY
          What?

                         JAMES LEER
          You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's 
          dog.

                         GRADY
          It wasn't her dog. It's her husband's--
               (stopping)
          Who said anything about girlfriend?

     James eyes shift slowly, as if to 'say: Who are you 
     kidding?

                         GRADY
          Okay, James, I wish you hadn't shot my 
          girlfriend's dog. Even though Poe and I weren't 
          exactly what you'd call simpatico, that's no 
          reason for him to take two in the chest. Still, 
          the fact remains that I'm the one who took you 
          up into the Chancellor's bedroom. I'm the one 
          who has to take the blame. I- don't know what 
          the hell I was thinking.

                         JAMES LEER
          Sure you do. You were thinking: 'That's no cap 
          gun in that kid's overcoat.' You were thinking 
          'I can't let that kid get on. the bus alone-he 
          might never get on the bus again.' You were 
          thinking: 'I've got to find a way to distract 
          this kid. ' So you did. It was--in its way--a 
          noble act.

                         GRADY
          Thanks for the halo, James, but I've . never 
          done that much thinking ahead in my" life-ever.

     James looks -out the window, pondering this.

                         JAMES LEER
          So, why did you take me up there?

                         GRADY
               (feeling for the heat again)
          I -don' t know, James . I don' t know why I do 
          half the things I do. Who does?
               (looking over)
          Why do you wear that coat?

     James looks down, a little defensive.

                         JAMES LEER 
          It's warm.

                         GRADY
          James, fall semester, first day of class, it 
          was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat.

     James just blinks, no ready answer-available.

                         GRADY
          That's why they all give you such a hard time 
          in workshop.

                         JAMES LEER 
          Because of my coat?

                         GRADY
          Because you act like a goddamn spook all the 
          time. Not to mention the fact that every last 
          one of them is jealous of you.

                         JAMES LEER 
               (smirking) 
          Jealous? Of me?

                         GRADY
          Not you. Your talent.

     James' face hardens. He looks away.

                         JAMES LEER 
          You're lying.

                         GRADY
          The hell I am.

                         JAMES LEER
          Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You 
          said so yourself.

                         GRADY
          I never said that.

                         JAMES LEER
          Yes you did. Last night. To your friend 
          Crabtree. "Is he any good?" he said. And you 
          said: "Not yet he isn't." I heard you myself.

                         GRADY
          I didn't mean it that way.

                         JAMES LEER
          It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard, 
          the others--they 're right. My stories are 
          annoying. They go on and on and on, and the 
          longer they go on the more annoying they 
          become, until finally you just want to grab 
          something heavy and--

                         GRADY
          Shut up, James. You're annoying. Carrie and 
          Howard don't know what the fuck they're talking 
          about, okay? The entire class combined-
          including the lovely Hannah Green-has about one 
          tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay?

     James stares blankly at Grady, then turns his face to the 
     window. He ponders Grady's words, the praise inherent in 
     them. A hint of pleasure glints in his eyes.

                         JAMES LEER 
          But, last night...

                         GRADY
          Who cares what-. I said last night, James I I 
          was drunk, I was stoned. I'd been bitten by a 
          dog. My wife had left me. How 'bout cutting me 
          some slack?

                         JAMES LEER 
               (quietly) 
          I'm sorry.

                         GRADY
          And don't be so goddamn sensitive. Who cares 
          what anybody thinks anyway? You want to .be a 
          good writer? You want to be-a great writer? 
          Then stop giving a damn what other people 
          think. Most of them haven't thought in .years.

     James turns, studies Grady's face as it flickers in the 
     first headlights of the evening.

                         GRADY
          Let me spell it .out for you, James. Books 
          don't mean anything. Not to anybody. Not 
          anymore.

                         JAMES LEER
          Arsonist's Daughter meant something.

     GRADY smiles contemptuously.

                         JAMES LEER
          I mean it. It means something to me. It's one 
          of the reasons I came to school here. To be in 
          your class. To be taught by you.
               (quietly)
          It's one of the reasons I wanted to become a 
          writer.

     GRADY stares ahead, watching the darkness tumble away 
     before the wide sweep of the Galaxie's headlights.

                         GRADY
          Well, for that, if nothing else, James, I'm 
          sorry.

72     EXT. COFFEE SHOP/MOTEL - OFF THE HIGHWAY - EVENING 

     GRADY rolls into a space near the coffee shop and James 
     slides out. GRADY
     stays put, hands still on the wheel.

                         JAMES LEER
          You coming?

                         GRADY
          In a minute. Get us a table.

     James nods, pushes past the glass doors into the coffee 
     shop, and a big REDHEAD in a waitress cap leads him to a 
     table with a view of the highway. GRADY
     watches James-- stick figure in black brogues--slide into 
     the booth and open his big, laminated menu.

     Finally, as if concluding some internal debate, GRADY 
     kicks open his door, steps out.

73INT/     EXT. PHONE BOOTH - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER  

     GRADY rests his forehead against the PAYPHONE as he 
     speaks.

                         GRADY
          C-a-r-v-e-I. That's right, Carvel. Yes, I'm 
          sure. It's outside Scranton.

     GRADY straightens up, takes a peek at James, sitting by 
     himself on the far side of the coffee shop.

                         GRADY
          You have no listing. Okay, well, lady-- at 
          this very moment, as we speak, I'm looking of a 
          resident of Carvel, Pennsylvania. I think he'd 
          be pretty interested to learn that the good 
          people of Bell Atlantic have misplaced his 
          entire hometown. It's not like I'm making this 
          up as I go along--

     GRADY stops, his own words ringing in his head.

                         GRADY (cont'd)
          Never mind. My mistake.

74     EXT. GALAXIE - PARKING LOT     74

     GRADY upends James' knapsack, sifts through: An 
     AUTOGRAPHED POSTCARD of FRANCES FARMER. A wrinkled box of 
     CHICLETS. Nothing. Then he notices ERROL FLYNN'S eyebrows 
     peeking at him from the knapsack's side pouch.

     He takes the book, opens it. Bingo. A library notice: 
     James Seiwyn Leer is three weeks overdue. Under ADDRESS it 
     says only: "On File." But if one was to dial the PHONE 
     NUMBER, odds are it won't be the night janitor at the 
     Greyhound depot who picks up.

75     INT. BOOTH - COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT (LATER)

     The remains of a FRIED CLAM SANDWICH sit before James as 
     he turns his attention to a GIANT PIECE OF LEMON MERINGUE 
     PIE. GRADY sips only coffee, stealing glances at the cars 
     that whip by on the highway beyond the window.

                         JAMES LEER 
          Want a bite?

                         GRADY
          No thanks.

                         JAMES LEER
          That's why you're having them. Your spells.

                         GRADY
          Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like 
          we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't 
          have spells.

                         JAMES LEER 
          What would you call them then?

                         GRADY
          I don't know. ...'Episodes.'

     James shrugs, spears a fluffy chunk of pie.

                         JAMES LEER
          It's because you don't eat.

                         GRADY
          I eat.

                         JAMES LEER
          When?

                         GRADY
          When nobody's looking.

     GRADY watches a pair of headlights approach...

                         JAMES LEER
               (mouth full, garbled)
          I just worry about you, that's all.

     ...then pass. James' words finally register. GRADY looks 
     at him.

                         GRADY
          You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?

                         JAMES LEER
          Okay.

     Just then, a long, pale WAND of LIGHT splinters against 
     the coffee shop windows and a CAR sweeps into the parking 
     lot. GRADY follows it with his eyes, rises.

                         JAMES LEER (cont'd) 
          Where you going?

                         GRADY
          Nowhere. You just sit here and... eat.

     GRADY moves off, then stops, looking back at James and 
     his giant piece of pie, still troubled by his words.

76     EXT. COFFEE SHOP/MOTEL   

     As GRADY limps out of the coffee shop, he finds an OLDER 
     MAN in a TUXEDO standing in the open door of a gleaming 
     BLACK MERCEDES. Beyond him, in the front passenger seat, a 
     WOMAN in MINK examines her eye shadow in the tiny mirror of 
     the sun visor.

                         MAN
               (eyeing GRADY dubiously) 
          Professor Tripp?

                         GRADY
          Grady.

                         MAN
          Fred Leer. This is my wife Amanda.

                         GRADY
               (re: their clothes)
          Looks like I've dashed a-wonderful evening.

                         FRED LEER
          Hardly.

                         AMANDA LEER
          We were on our way to a benefit. But, as luck 
          would have it, the club was on the way, so... 
               (snapping shut the visor)
          We were able to put in an appearance.

                         FRED LEER
          Otherwise we would've been here earlier.

                         GRADY
          Ah. Well, that's ail right. James and I 'had a 
          little dinner.

                         FRED LEER
          Well, certainly we'll reimburse you.

                         GRADY
          That's not necessary. I just felt. ..it might 
          be good for James to be with his family this 
          weekend.

                         FRED LEER
          Well, of course, we can understand that.

     GRADY considers the two glittering ghosts before him. 
     They seem to be waiting. Just waiting.

                         GRADY
          Well. Let me go get him.

     GRADY turns for the coffee shop, then stops, looks back.

                         GRADY (cont'd)
          I "hope you won't consider this forward of me, 
          Amanda, but I wonder if I might ask. ..did you 
          ever attend Catholic school?

     Amanda Leer's eyes narrow ever-so-slightly.

                         AMANDA LEER 
          Excuse me?

77     INT. BOOTH - COFFEE SHOP77 

     James is glowering at the parking lot as GRADY returns.

                         JAMES LEER
          I'm not going with them..

                         GRADY
          James. Listen. Things-things are a little 
          weird with me right now and I-- well--I have 
          enough blame to shoulder these days without 
          having to take the blame if something bad 
          happened to you. And if you hang around me long 
          enough, something bad is going to happen, trust 
          me. That's why I need you to go home. 
          Understand?

                         JAMES LEER 
          I'm not going, with them.

                         GRADY
          James, like it or not, they're your parents.

                         JAMES LEER
          Parents? They're not my parents. They're my 
          grandparents. My parents are dead.

     GRADY stares at-James wearily.

                         JAMES LEER
          I swear. My father had his own airplane he 
          used to fly up to Quebec. One Christmas, he and 
          my mom were flying up to our house in the 
          Laurentians when the plane went down. It was in 
          the newspaper.

     GRADY doesn't flinch, unpersuaded.

                         JAMES LEER
          I 'swear. My father was a senior vice 
          president at Dravo. My mother was a socialite. 
          Her maiden name was Guggenheim.

     GRADY starts to protest, then pauses.

                         GRADY
          I remember that. Five or six years ago.

                         JAMES LEER
          Six. Their plane went down right outside 
          Scranton.

                         GRADY 
               (sardonically) 
          Near Carvel?

                         JAMES LEER
          I'm sorry about all that. I just-I don't like 
          to talk about my family. They treat me like a 
          freak. 
               (nodding towards Amanda)

     She makes me sleep in. the basement of my own house. It's 
     mine. My parents left it to me.

     GRADY glances toward the parking lot, studies the  
     contours of Fred Leer's face. Frowns.

                         GRADY
          James, come on. That man is obviously your 
          father. You look just like him.

     James looks down at the table, takes a deep breath, and 
     speaks in a voice heavy with implication.

                         JAMES LEER
          There's a reason for that.

     Grady's addled brain grapples with this dark little 
     riddle, finally deciphers what James is suggesting.

                         GRADY
          Get out of here.

                         JAMES LEER
          That's why she hates me. That's why she makes 
          me sleep in the basement.

                         GRADY
          In the crawl space, with the rats and the 
          casks of Amontillado. Come on. Up.

     As GRADY lifts him from the booth, James attempts a 
     plaintive tone, but his heart's not in it.

                         JAMES LEER 
          I swear.

78     EXT. COFFEE SHOP - MOMENTS LATER       78

     As Fred Leer SLAMS the back door of the Mercedes, GRADY 
     waves vaguely, peers into the darkness of the back seat.

                         FRED LEER 
          Thank you. Professor Tripp.

                         GRADY
          Take care of him.

                         AMANDA LEER
          Oh, don't worry. We'll take care of him. You 
          can be sure of that.

     Fred Leer hits the gas and swings the Mercedes around in 
     a tight little arc, feathering Grady's pants--from the knee 
     down--with a pudding of ICE and MUD. GRADY glances down at 
     his spattered self, then notices, sitting on the front 
     passenger seat, James' knapsack. GRADY grabs it, turns.

                         GRADY
          Hey!

     GRADY'S POV - REAR WINDOW
     as the Mercedes begins to pull away and James turns, 
     elbows on the back dash, his pale face slack. Spying Grady, 
     he raises one limp hand, and then-as if it were held by a 
     string-lets it drop.

                         GRADY (cont'd) 
               (softly) 
          Hey.

79     EXT. PARKING LOT - MQTEL/COFFEE SHOP - A. BIT LATER   

     GRADY sits in-the GREEN GLOW of .the radio dial, smoking 
     a joint. He glances at the knapsack, sees James' 
     MANUSCRIPT:

     The Love Parade

     He reaches in, takes the manuscript and, in the light 
     that rains from the PARKING LAMP overhead, begins to read.

80     EXT. GRADY'S HOUSE - NIGHT (LATER)      80

     Grady's HOUSE looks like a three-dollar whore on a block 
     full of nuns. MUSIC BLARES, LIGHT BLAZES from every window, 
     and there are so many CARS GRADY is forced to leave the 
     Galaxie in the middle of the street.


                         GRADY
               (knowingly) 
          Crabtree.

81     INT. GRADY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER  

     Times Square before the ball drops. GRADY enters, scans 
     the room, then shoulders his way to the stairs.

82     INT. GRADY'S OFFICE  

     Hannah Green sits on the sofa, twisting a long strand of 
     hair around her finger as she reads a THICK MANUSCRIPT.

                         GRADY
               (entering) 
          Hey.

                         HANNAH GREEN
          Grady!

     She slaps the page she is reading back onto the stack at 
     her thigh. GRADY
     stares. The manuscript. It's his.

                         HANNAH GREEN
               (embarrassed)
          I know I shouldn't have, but there it was, 
          just sort of lying out, and I couldn't resist 
          and-and--I suck.

                         GRADY
          No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it 
          out in the open like that. CRABTREE hasn't been 
          in here, has he? Poking around?

                         HANNAH GREEN
          I don't know--maybe- I don't think so.

     Grady's  mind races with unfortunate possibilities, but 
     only briefly: his immediate thoughts are elsewhere.

                         GRADY
          Listen, Hannah. You don't remember where that 
          aunt worked, do you? James' aunt.

                         HANNAH GREEN
          He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The 
          blind one.

                         GRADY
          Actually, He's not the Chancellor' s--What?

                         HANNAH GREEN
          At first the police thought he just ran away, 
          but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood 
          spots on the carpet -

                         GRADY
          Jesus.

                         HANNAH GREEN
          CRABTREE said it sounded like something James 
          would be messed up in.

                         GRADY
          Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.

                         HANNAH GREEN
          Who does?

     Just then, Crabtree's VOICE bellows in the hallway 
     outside.

                         CRABTREE (O.S.) 
          Trip?! Where are you'

     GRADY looks anxiously toward the door.

                         GRADY
          The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James 
          that day?

                         HANNAH GREEN
          I told you, Sewickly Heights.      

                         GRADY
          But where? I need the street.

                         HANNAH GREEN
          I don't know, Grady. I just dropped him on a 
          corner. 

                         CRABTREE (O.S.)
          Trip?!

                         GRADY
          Shit.

     As GRADY starts to turn away, Hannah hooks her finger 
     inside his belt buckle.

                         HANNAH GREEN
          No! Don't go. I've been waiting ail night for 
          you.

     GRADY looks at Hannah's hand, where it rests. He looks 
     terrified.

                         GRADY
          Listen, Hannah, I'm flattered, really, but 
          right now I--

                         CRABTREE
               (bursting in)
          Tripp, where the hell. . .

     CRABTREE stops, takes in the tableau before him.

                         CRABTREE (cont'd)
          Oh, I'm sorry. Am I interrupting a. student-
          teacher conference?

     GRADY delicately removes Hannah's hand from his buckle, 
     points at Crabtree.

                         GRADY
          You stay there.

                         CRABTREE
          What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?

     CRABTREE cocks his head toward the reams of paper stacked 
     on Grady's desk.

                         CRABTREE
          Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would 
          sneak in here and read your book without asking 
          you?

                         GRADY
          Gee, I don't know. Crabs. I don't seem to 
          remember you actually asking me if you could 
          invite 200 people over to trash my living room.

                         CRABTREE
          Sometimes we have to improvise.

                         GRADY
               (ignoring him)
          Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I 
          mean, besides you and. ..me?

                         CRABTREE
          James? My James? What's happened?

                         GRADY
          Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't 
          know.. .kidnapped.

                         CRABTREE
          Kidnapped? By who?

                         GRADY
          His parents.

                         CRABTREE
          Good God. Let's go rescue him.

                         GRADY
          Good idea. Crabs. Only one problem. I don't 
          know where they live.

                         CRABTREE
          Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know 
          where he lives.

                         GRADY
          It's a little late to call Admissions.

                         CRABTREE
          Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?

                         GRADY
          Maybe ...I don't know.

                         HANNAH GREEN
          Two-sixty-two Baxter Drive.

     GRADY and CRABTREE turn, see Hannah sitting on the corner 
     of Grady's desk with the WHITE PAGES open on her lap.

                         HANNAH GREEN (cont'd)
          They're in the book.

83     INT. GALAXIE - MOVING - TEN MINUTES LATER

     CRABTREE snaps James' manuscript closed.

                         CRABTREE
          You know--based on what I've read-- this is a 
          very exciting piece of material, this Big 
          Parade.

                         GRADY
          Love. It's Love facade--and what do you mean 
          'based on what you've read'? You skimmed two 
          chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling 
          methamphetamines.

                         CRABTREE
          I've been doing this a long time, Tripp. I 
          feel this kid in my bones.

                         GRADY
          Only in your bones?

     GRADY smirks, glances at Crabtree, but gets a surprise; 
     CRABTREE offers no snappy come-back, no antic wordplay. He 
     just stares out the window, his voice distant.

                         CRABTREE
          No. I think I might be right. I've felt it 
          before...

     As Crabtree's voice trails off, GRADY studies him.

                         GRADY
          How bad is it for you?

                         CRABTREE
          Bad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit 
          the new corporate profile.

                         GRADY
          Which is?

                         CRABTREE
          Competence.

     GRADY and CRABTREE look at each other a moment, then 
     CRABTREE smiles, gives a little shrug, and picks up James' 
     knapsack, rummaging through the contents.

                         CRABTREE (cont'd) 
          So tell me about you and the Chancellor.

                         GRADY
          What's to tell?

                         CRABTREE
          Plenty, I'm sure. But, for what it's worth...

     CRABTREE fishes out the biography of Erroll Flynn, gives 
     it a look.

                         CRABTREE
          ...I like her.

     GRADY peers at the stars, his voice barely audible.

                         GRADY
          Me too.

84     EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - SEWICKLEY HEIGHTS     84-

     The battered Galaxie floats up a narrow road, gliding 
     through a canyon of mansion walls and the occasional 
     winding drive. Up ahead a stone post marker with the 
     numerals "262." GRADY kills the headlights.

                         GRADY
          This is it.

84A     EXT. LEER HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

     Grady--limping like an aging prizefighter--leads CRABTREE 
     up a steep incline toward an enormous three-story house. 
     The Leer's Mercedes gleams in the shadows.

                         CRABTREE
          Jesus. There must be two dozen windows on . 
          that thing. How are we-supposed to find his?

                         GRADY
          I told you. They keep him chained in the 
          basement. Come on.

85     EXT. REAR - LEER HOUSE

     LIGHT GLOWS from a low BASEMENT WINDOW. From one side, a 
     WOMAN is HEARD SINGING. GRADY and CRABTREE pause, listen.

                         WOMAN SINGING 
          Why should I care though he gave me the air? 
          Why should I cry, heave a sigh, and wonder why? 
          And wonder why?

                         CRABTREE
          Doris Day.

     CRABTREE and GRADY look at each other.

                         GRADY/CRABTREE
          James Leer.

     GRADY moves to the window and RAPS on the glass. A moment 
     later, James peeks out. Seeing Grady, his face brightens 
     briefly, unguarded, then quickly resumes its usual Leerian 
     aspect. He motions with his hand, as if to say, "That way."

86     EXT. BASEMENT DOOR    

     The DOOR swings open to reveal James Leer, decked out in 
     a pair of RED, INK-STAINED PAJAMAS sagging badly in the 
     seat. He looks like one of Santa's elves.

                         JAMES LEER
          Hey. What are you guys doing here?

                         CRABTREE
          We're springing you. Leer. Get some pants on.

     As they step inside, GRADY gives James' PJs the once-
     over.

                         GRADY
          I can't believe you made fun of my robe.

87     INT. JAMES' ROOM - BASEMENT    87

     Electric CANDELABRAS light a large converted cellar whose 
     walls are crowded with MOVIE POSTERS and LOBBY CARDS. There 
     are STACKS of what look suspiciously like LIBRARY BOOKS and 
     an enormous BAROQUE BED, complete with CANOPY.

                         CRABTREE
          I like what you've done with it. When's 
          Captain Nemo moving in?

                         JAMES LEER 
          The candelabras were my Gran's.

                         GRADY
          Oh, Christ, don't start on ol' Gran or we'll 
          leave you here.

                         CRABTREE
          Hey, I heard all about it--the parents, the 
          grandparents, the China town thing-- and I 
          believe you, okay? That's why we're here. Now 
          go get dressed.

     James scoops up the shirt GRADY lent him. this morning.

                         JAMES LEER
          Can I--I mean--do you mind--if I wear this 
          again. Professor Tripp?

                         GRADY
          Ah, wear whatever you want.

     James flinches, stung, then disappears into a bathroom.

                         CRABTREE
          So modest.

                         GRADY
          So sensitive.

                         CRABTREE
               (nosing around the room)
          Oh, come on, Tripp. Cut the kid some slack.

                         GRADY
          It's just ail that crap he spins out. Just 
          once I'd like to know if the little bastard is 
          telling the truth.

                         CRABTREE
          The-truth. I know that's always been real 
          important to you. Key, check this out...

     CRABTREE leans over an old ROYAL TYPEWRITER, reads from 
     the freshly-typed PAGE curling from the carriage.

                         CRABTREE
          Finally, the door opened. It-was a shock to: 
          see him, shuffling into the room like an aging 
          prizefighter. Limping. Beaten.'
               (with an amused smile) 
          Sound like anyone we know?
               (resuming) 
          But it was later, when the great man squinted 
          into the bitter glow or twilight...
               (frowning)
          Bitter glow of twilight? This kid definitely 
          needs an editor.
               (resuming)
     ...and muttered simply, "It means nothing. All of it. 
     Nothing," that the true shock came. It was then that the 
     boy understood that his hero's true injuries lay hidden in 
     a darker place. His heart...'

     CRABTREE stops abruptly.

                         GRADY
          Yes? 'His heart...'

     CRABTREE hesitates, then... reads on:

                         CRABTREE
          'His heart, once capable of inspiring others 
          so completely, could no longer inspire so much 
          as itself. It beat now only out of habit. It 
          beat now only because it could. '

     GRADY nods, his face unreadable, then James returns.

                         JAMES LEER 
          I'm ready...

     James stops, sees the two men looking at him.

                         JAMES LEER 
          You all right, Professor Tripp?

                         CRABTREE
          He's great. Come on, let's blow before ol' 
          Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.

                         JAMES LEER
          Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming 
          down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, 
          check on me. If I'm not here, she might ...call 
          the police or.. .something.

                         CRABTREE
          Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows 
          and one of your teddy bears under the spread 
          and she won't know the difference.

                         JAMES LEER 
               (brightening)
          Yeah. Like in Against All Flags. Only they use 
          a couple big hams.

                         GRADY
          No.

     CRABTREE and James turn.

                         GRADY
          I've got something better than a teddy bear.

     CUT TO: POE -- as he's lowered delicately onto James' 
     bed. 

88     INT. JAMES' ROOM - BASEMENT (A FEW MINUTES LATER) 

     GRADY strategically arranges the coverlet, gently 
     adjusting Poe's head so only a TUFT of FUR shows. He steps 
     back, joining CRABTREE and James for an assessment.

                         GRADY
          Sweet dreams, Jimmy.

89     EXT. GRADY'S HOUSE - LATER 

     The lights are still blazing, the front door is wide 
     open, but not a soul remains.

90     INT. LIVING ROOM

     A quiet disaster, the only sound an LP playing meekly on 
     the STEREO. James passes through first, ignoring the 
     TORTILLA CHIPS POPPING under his shoes, then CRABTREE and 
     GRADY appear.

                         CRABTREE
          Things must've picked up after we left.

     CRABTREE pats Grady's cheek, heads upstairs. 

91     INT. HALLWAY

     Crabtree's door is closing as GRADY hobbles into view.

                         GRADY
          Crabtree.

                         CRABTREE
               (sticking his head out) 
          Ye-es?

     GRADY looks down, sees James Leer's black brogues sitting 
     on the floor outside Crabtree's door.

                         GRADY
          Nothing.

     The door closes, the LATCH CLICKS, and GRADY is left 
     alone, the bossa nova floating softly in the air.

92     INT. HANNAH'S ROOM 

     Hannah Green lies tangled in the sheets, surrounded by 
     little colonies of Grady's manuscript. GRADY studies her, 
     then detects something on the floor. The red boots.

     Delicately, he lifts the sheet. Hannah Green's feet-- 
     finally revealed in ail their naked glory--prove to be 
     thick, wide, and ordinary. GRADY
     sighs.

93     INT. GRADY'S OFFICE 

     The TV is on. GRADY steps to the doorway, pauses.

                         VOICE 
          Hey.

     A HEAD cranes over the sofa. It's the Goatee Kid from 
     Thaw Hail.

                         GRADY
          How are you--is it Joe?

                         GOATEE KID
          Jeff. Sorry. I didn't even know this was your 
          house until about an hour ago.

                         GRADY
          Don't sweat it. Well. 'Night, Jeff.

                         GOATEE KID
          Oh, Professor Tripp? You know, last semester, 
          what I said that time in office hours-I hope 
          there's no hard feelings.

                         GRADY
          No...

                         GOATEE KID
          I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at 
          the time and my car was ail fucked up and--
          well--I was pretty bent in general.

                         GRADY
          It's cool, Jeff. Really.

                         GOATEE KID
          I just want you to know that's why I dropped 
          your class and said all that shit about the 
          university stealing my money and you being a 
          pseudo-Faulknerian nobody.

94     EXT. PORCH - GRADY'S HOUSE - NIGHT (A BIT LATER)

     GRADY sits quietly on the porch steps, a joint burning in 
     his fingers. To his left, perched atop a Haagen-Dazs 
     container, is a TELEPHONE. As he pulls it into his lap, a 
     LAMP in the living room pirouettes clumsily, spins free of 
     the cord, and SHATTERS on the floor.

     GRADY blinks, looks away, and DIALS, just as. ..the 
     CLATTERING COUGH of an ENGINE is HEARD and a VAN appears. 
     Stenciled on its side panel is:

     Kravnik's Sporting Goods

     The van slows, almost coasting, then abruptly bursts past 
     Grady's house and disappears around the corner. GRADY 
     frowns, then realizes a MAN'S VOICE is coming from the 
     RECEIVER in his lap.

                         MAN (O.S. ) 
          Hello? Hello...?

     The VOICE is groggy. It is Walter Gaskell's voice.

                         GRADY
          Walter?

                         WALTER'S VOICE 
          Yes?

     GRADY says nothing, as if wondering what he's doing.

                         WALTER'S VOICE (cont'd) 
          Who's this ?

                         GRADY
          It's Grady, Walter.

                         WALTER'S VOICE 
          Grady?

                         GRADY
          GRADY Tripp. English Department.

                         WALTER'S VOICE
          I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, 
          Grady, do you know what time it -is?

                         GRADY
               (looking at his watch)
          I have ...eight-fifteen. That's not right, is 
          it?

                         WALTER'S VOICE 
          It's three-thirty, Grady.

                         GRADY
          This is important.

                         WALTER'S VOICE 
          Oh? 

                         GRADY
          I... I...

                         WALTER'S VOICE 
          What is it, Grady?

                         GRADY
          I'm in love with your wife.

                         WALTER'S VOICE 
          Excuse me?

                         GRADY
          Sara. I'm in love with her.

     Silence. Then Walter's VOICE returns: even, 
     administrative.

                         WALTER'S VOICE
          Are you drinking. Professor Tripp? Right now.

     GRADY sips on his roach, responds in a pinched voice.

                         GRADY
          No. 

                         WALTER'S VOICE
          Nevertheless, I'd like to see you in my office 
          Monday morning.

     As the line goes dead, GRADY stares at the phone, 
     wondering if he has, in fact, just done what he thinks he's 
     just done.

95     EXT. GRADY'S NEIGHBORHOOD - SUNDAY MORNING (NEXT DAY)

     A CAR rattles down the street, NEWSPAPERS pinwheeling 
     from-the window.

96     INT. GRADY'S OFFICE - SAME TIME

     A heavy THHNK hits the driveway outside and GRADY blinks. 
     Sitting in his pink robe, bleary-eyed, he reconsiders the 
     piece of paper curling from his typewriter.

     GRADY'S POV - of THE PAGE

     It's obvious he's been sitting like this for some time. 
     Just then, the DISTINCTIVE PURR of an ENGINE is HEARD. 
     GRADY peers through the window, watches a CAB. glide to the 
     curb below. A Citroen DS23. Sara.

97     EXT. FRONT PORCH - GRADY'S HOUSE

     GRADY steps onto the porch, unintentionally punting a 
     BOTTLE of Iron City Beer onto the front lawn..

                         GRADY
          Sara.

                         SARA
          I tried to call, but apparently there's 
          something wrong...

     Sara leans down, replaces the uncradled phone.

                         SARA (cont'd) 
          ...with your phone. Unfortunately, mine was 
          ringing loud and clear this morning.

     GRADY doesn't know what this means, but he's pretty sure 
     it's not good.

                         GRADY
          Oh?

                         SARA
          It seems one of our students is - missing and 
          his parents found a dead dog in his bed.

                         GRADY
               (slumping to the porch)
          I'm sorry, Sara. I've been trying to tell you. 
          It's all my-

     Sara raises her hand, silencing him.

                         SARA
          I'm not very happy with you right now, Grady. 
          But more importantly, Walter's not very happy 
          and he's gotten the police involved. They seem 
          to think James Leer is somehow responsible for 
          all of this. You wouldn't happen to know where 
          James is, would you, Grady?

                         GRADY
          Inside.

                         SARA 
          And the jacket?

                         GRADY
          Over there. In the backseat of the...

     Grady's hand hangs in mid-air, gesturing pointlessly to 
     the driveway, where the only thing that exists is an oil 
     stain roughly the shape of North Dakota.

                         GRADY (cont'd) 
          Someone stole my car.

                         SARA
          Grady.

                         GRADY
          Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it 
          right there last night.

                         SARA
          Are you sure you parked it there?

                         GRADY
          Of course, I'm sure.  Ah, Christ, the puberty 
          police are back.

     Sara turns, sees Officer Pupcik cruising to the curb.

                         SARA
          I'll deal with this. You dig up James.

98     INT. CRABTREE'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

     CRABTREE sits in bed, flipping through the pages of The 
     Love Parade while stroking a tiny TUFT of HAIR that is the 
     . sole visible part of .James Leer.

                         GRADY
               (swinging in)
          Is he awake?

                         CRABTREE
          I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.

                         GRADY
          Nevertheless. There's a police officer 
          standing on the porch and I don't think he's 
          going away.

                         JAMES LEER
               (from under the covers) 
          That same guy?

     CRABTREE peels back the blankets and James Leer opens one 
     eye.

                         JAMES LEER 
          You snore.

                         CRABTREE
          So I hear.

                         JAMES LEER 
               (studying Grady)
          No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look 
          sorta crappy.

                         CRABTREE
          He's right, you look horrible.

                         GRADY
          Thank you, Frankie and Annette.

     James swings his pale little legs to the floor and walks 
     bare assed across the room to retrieve his BVDs.

                         JAMES LEER 
          It's the Chancellor.

                         CRABTREE
          Ah, right. Well, I gave you my opinion.

                         GRADY
          And we both thank you for that, but we're... 
          we're... fine.

                         JAMES LEER
          I'm fine, right. Fit as a fucking fiddle.

     GRADY squints at James as he pulls on his pants.

                         GRADY
          Shut up, James.

                         CRABTREE
          So what's the problem?

                         GRADY
               (a tad tense)
          There is no problem. Did I say there was a 
          problem?

     As James' head pops through Grady's fully-buttoned 
     flannel, he and CRABTREE
     exchange a knowing glance, at once referring to and 
     excluding Grady.

                         SARA (0. S.)
          How's it coming back there, Professor Tripp?

                         CRABTREE
          Who's that?

                         GRADY
          Who do you think it is?

                         CRABTREE
          The Chancellor's here? Now?

                         GRADY
          Evidently. 
               (calling)
          Coming!     

                         JAMES LEER
          Does she mean--does she know about ...her dog?

                         GRADY
          It's Walter's dog and yes, she does. Know. But 
          let's spare her the details. Come on, your 
          shoes are in the hail.

                         CRABTREE
          James. This book of yours. It's not bad. Not 
          bad at all.

     James stops, considers this piece of news with a look of 
     deep seriousness, then nods.

                         JAMES LEER 
          Thank you.

                         CRABTREE
          You're welcome.

     As James shuffles off into the hail, CRABTREE looks at 
     Grady, his eyes dancing with excitement.


                         CRABTREE
          I want to publish this.  I've got to.  I think 
          they'll let me.  With a little editorial 
          guidance it could be brilliant. 

                         GRADY
          Great. Between you and Officer Pupcik out 
          there he can be the next Jean Genet. It's been 
          awhile since somebody wrote a good book in 
          jail.

99     EXT. GRADY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

     Sara and GRADY stand by as Pete Pupcik deposits James in 
     the back of the squad car, SLAMS the door.

     PUPCIK
     As I told the Chancellor, Professor, I'm. just going to 
     run James here over to the university. It'll be up to Dr. 
     Gaskell where we go from there.

     GRADY nods, leans in the window to James.

                         GRADY
          Don't worry, James, I'll figure something out.

                         JAMES LEER
          I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. 
          Professor Tripp?

                         GRADY
          I'm a little worried, James.

                         JAMES LEER 
          Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I 
          probably should be expelled.

                         GRADY
          Well, let's see if we can keep that from 
          happening.

     James nods and GRADY starts to step back from the car.

                         JAMES LEER
          Professor Tripp...?

                         GRADY
          Yes, James.

                         JAMES LEER
          Even if I end up going to jail....

     James smiles his crooked grin.

                         JAMES LEER (cont'd)
          You're still the best teacher I ever had.

     On this,  Pete Pupcik pulls away, leaving GRADY standing 
     on the curb, watching the back of James' head, framed in 
     the rear  window of the police car, growing smaller.

                         SARA
          This is not what the university has in mind 
          when it promises a liberal education, Grady.

                         GRADY
          Would Walter really press charges?

                         SARA
          It's within the realm. He takes his souvenirs 
          pretty seriously. And he was just a wee bit 
          prickly this morning.

     Grady, detecting something in Sara's tone, turns, watches 
     her take a drag on her cigarette.

                         SARA (cont'd) 
          You didn't happen to call the house last 
          night, did you, Grady?

                         GRADY
          I think I might have.

                         SARA
          And what do you think you might have said?

                         GRADY
          I think I might've said I was in love with 
          you.

     Sara's face remains .unchanged.

                         GRADY (cont'd) 
          He told you.

                         SARA 
          He told me.

                         GRADY
          And what did you say?

                         SARA
          I said it didn't sound like you. 

     Sara tosses her cigarette in .the gutter, gets into her 
     car, and dives away.  GRADY looks after her sadly, then 
     turns, sees CRABTREE standing on the porch wearing a shirt 
     which claims "Ativan Chases the Clouds Away."

                         CRABTREE
          So- what do we do now? ,

                         GRADY
          Find the jacket.

                         CRABTREE
          Oh' huh. Exactly how do we do that?

                         GRADY
          First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her 
          car.

                         CRABTREE
          It seems to me that girl would let you borrow 
          her pancreas.

100     INT. HANNAH'S ROOM   - 100

     Hannah, wrapped loosely in cotton sheets, SMILES as she 
     listens to the Goatee Kid, who sits cross-legged at the 
     foot of-her bed, fully clothed.

                         GOATEE KID
          I'm telling you, the tango is ail about latent 
          homosexual love. Look at the way they dance--
          it's sodomy.

                         HANNAH GREEN
               (laughing) 
          Stop it.

     Hannah looks up, sees GRADY in the doorway and blushes. 
     She pulls the sheet up, gives an oddly formal wave.

                         HANNAH GREEN
          Grady. Hi. What's up?

     Jeff eases off the bed, past GRADY uneasily.

                         GOATEE KID
          I'll be ...somewhere else.

                         GRADY
          Hey, Jeff. If you're really interested in 
          discussing that business with the tango, try 
          the guy at the end of the hall.

     Jeff nods--puzzled--then goes. GRADY smirks.

                         GRADY
          He cribbed that from Borges.

                         HANNAH GREEN
          It beats 'What's your major?'

     GRADY nods, detecting a new aloofness in her voice.

                         GRADY
          Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could 
          borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of 
          commission.

                         HANNAH GREEN
          Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to. 
          ..to your book.

     The hitch in Hannah's voice hangs in the room like a 
     cloud.

                         HANNAH GREEN
          I uh, I didn't finish, I ...fell asleep.

                         GRADY
          That good, hub?

                         HANNAH GREEN
          No, it's not that, it's...

     Hannah glances at the huge stack of paper sitting on her 
     dresser, then, hesitantly, looks back to Grady.

                         HANNAH GREEN
          It's just that, you know, I was thinking about 
          how, in class, you're always telling us '-that 
          writers make choices--at least the good ones. 
          And, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the 
          book isn't really great-I mean, really great-
          but at times it's, well, very detailed, you 
          know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses 
          and ail the dental records and so on-and I 
          don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but it sort of 
          reads, in places, like, well, actually, like... 
               (with trepidation)
     ...you didn't make any choices at all. And I was 
     wondering if it might not be different if, maybe, when you 
     wrote, you weren't always ...under the influence.

                         GRADY
               (stung)
          Hh huh. Well, thanks for the thought, but, as 
          shocking as this may sound, I'm not the first 
          writer to sip a little weed. And furthermore, 
          it might interest you to know that one book I 
          wrote, as you say, 'under the influence, ' 
          happened to win a little something called the 
          PEN award which, by the way, I accepted 'under 
          the influence. '

     Hannah nods, averts her eyes, and immediately GRADY feels 
     ridiculous. He starts to say something, but instead gathers 
     his manuscript and exits.

101     INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER   

     Crabtree, dressed now, studies the freight 'in Grady's 
     arms as he reaches the bottom of the stairs.

                         CRABTREE
          Want some help with that?

                         GRADY
               (passing by)
          Don't touch it.

102     INT. HANNAH'S RENAULT - MOVING  

     CRABTREE sucks on a Kool, driving Hannah's rattling 
     Renault too fast, shifting gears apparently at random. 
     GRADY rides shotgun, still wearing the robe over his 
     clothes, the Wonder Boys manuscript sitting like a 
     watermelon on his lap-looking, all in all, fairly pathetic.

                         CRABTREE
          Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan owes 
          you money. So, as collateral, he gives you his 
          car.

                         GRADY
          Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't 
          exactly Jerry's to give.

                         CRABTREE
          So whose car is it?

                         GRADY
          My guess-Vernon Hardapple.

                         CRABTREE
          The hood jumper?

                         GRADY
          He said a few things that lead me to believe 
          the car's his.

                         CRABTREE
          Such as.

                         GRADY
          'That's my car, motherfucker.'

                         CRABTREE
          Hh hub. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. 
          We find the car...

                         GRADY
          ...we find the jacket.

                         CRABTREE
          There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know 
          his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we 
          made the whole guy up.

                         GRADY
          No wonder he screwed us over.

     CUT TO:

     BILL MAZEROSKI legendary Pittsburgh Pirate second 
     baseman, large as a Macy's Day float, his weathered image 
     scaling three floors on the BRICK face of a RIVERFRONT 
     STOREFRONT.

103     INT. HANNAH'S CAR

     CRABTREE takes a corner recklessly, immediately slows, 
     and blinks in amazement.

                         CRABTREE
          Christ, Tripp. How did you know?

                         GRADY
          Call it a hunch.

     Parked in front of KRAVNIK'S SPORTING GOODS is the white 
     van. A few feet behind, the battered Galaxie.

                         CRABTREE
          I'd call it genius.

     GRADY steps out, strips off the robe, and drops the lumpy 
     leviathan that is his manuscript on the front seat.

                         GRADY
          It's good to know I'm still talented at 
          something. Keep the motor running.

104     EXT./     INT. GALAXIE    104

     GRADY peers into the backseat, squinting against the WIND 
     that swirls around him. Errol Flynn's face leers back at 
     him. But no jacket. GRADY slides in, pops the glove box, 
     and frowns at the ZIPLOC of Humboldt County. He pockets it 
     anyway, then spies something else.

     James Leer's little PEARL-HANDLED PISTOL.

     GRADY takes it, rotates it-in his palm. SUNLIGHT GLINTS 
     off the chrome barrel and everything slowly turns to a 
     SWEET, SOFT BLUR...

105     INT. HANNAH'S RENAULT 

     CRABTREE stomps on his Kool. GRADY looks very much like a 
     man who has pulled off the road to take a nap.

                         CRABTREE
          What the hell...

106     INT. GALAXIE

     As GRADY lolls behind the steering wheel, a CLOUD 
     appears, hovering, then slowly mutates, and GRADY realizes 
     it's not a cloud at all, it's

     MARILYN MONROE standing by the side mirror, wearing a 
     bright pink dress under her wedding jacket.

                         MARILYN 
          I know you. . .

     Marilyn's face swims before Grady's eyes, but there's 
     something wrong with it. This girl's eyes are brown and 
     besides, she's ...fat.

                         MARILYN (cont'd) 
          Double Dickel on the rocks.

     The last of the fairy dust evaporates and GRADY finds- 
     standing before him in a pink jersey dress and Marilyn 
     Monroe's wedding jacket--0ola, the pregnant waitress from 
     the Hi-Hat Club.

                         GRADY
          Oola.

                         OOLA 
          I never forget a drink.

                         GRADY
          I never forget an Oola.

     Suddenly, there is a HEAVY CLICK.

                         MAN'S VOICE (0.S.) 
          Forget me?

     GRADY starts to turn, but his head won't  move: largely 
     because the BARREL of a GERMAN NINE is pressed to his 
     temple. Grady's eyes slide.

                         GRADY
          Vernon.

                         VERNON
               (to Oola)
          Move away, cupcake.  He's got a gun.

                         GRADY
          Who's got a gun?

                         VERNON 
          You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it!

                         GRADY
          Relax, Vernon...

                         OOLA 
          Why's he calling you Vernon?

                         VERNON
          Why's he sitting in my car? He's crazy, that's 
          why. He probably calls everybody Vernon.

                         GRADY
          Not true. You're the only Vernon I know. 
          Actually, I'm wrong. I once knew a Vernon 
          Peabody at Penguin U.K.

                         VERNON 
          Shut up. 
               (to Oola)
          Cupcake. Please. Inside.

                         OOLA 
          You' re not going to shoot him, are you?

                         VERNON
          I'm going to shoot him. If he doesn't put that 
          gun down.

                         GRADY
          It's just a souvenir. They don't even make the 
          caps anymore.

                         VERNON
          Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And 
          that's a gun.

                         GRADY
          No, really....

     GRADY lifts his arm, points the little pearl-handled 
     pistol to the DARK CLOUDS overhead.

107     INT. HANNAH'S RENAULT

     CRABTREE jumps as the tiny pistol at the end of Grady's 
     arm FLASHES, makes a FEEBLE POP in the wind.

                         CRABTREE
          Holy shit.

108     EXT. KRAVNIKS 

     Vernon stands half-hunched, stunned.

                         VERNON 
          Are you crazy!

     The gunshot seems to have cleared Grady's head. He stares 
     at the gun, watches Vernon wrest it from his hand.

                         VERNON (cont'd)
          Get out! What's the matter with you? Can't you 
          see the condition my girl's in?

     As GRADY gets out of the car, Vernon places his hand on 
     Oola's tummy.

                         VERNON 
          You all right, cupcake?

                         OOLA 
          Who's Vernon?

     A rude SQUEAL breaks the silence--rubber scratching 
     asphalt--and Grady, Oola, and Vernon turn to see Hannah 
     Green's rattling Renault lurching awkwardly toward them.

                         VERNON 
          What the...?

     Gears GRINDING, tires smoking, CRABTREE fish-tails 
     wildly, then kicks open the passenger door.

                         CRABTREE
          Tripp! Run!

     GRADY doesn't move an inch, watching in mute amazement as 
     CRABTREE whistles by, proceeds halfway down the block, then 
     turns back for another pass.

                         VERNON
          Who the hell is that?

                         GRADY
          A Manhattan book editor murdering a Mormon 
          girl's clutch.

     The car bucks crazily, picks up speed, and Crabtree-- 
     swiping aside a flutter of MANUSCRIPT PAGES that have taken 
     flight inside the car--begins to veer right toward Grady, 
     Vernon, and Oola.

                         VERNON 
          Woah.

     Vernon steps into the street, levels the German Nine.

                         VERNON (cont'd) 
          Pull off, you crazy motherfucker!

     Frantic, GRADY steps between Vernon, the German Nine, and 
     the oncoming Crabtree.

                         GRADY
          No! Don't shoot! He's just a lousy driver.

     CRABTREE fans the wheel wildly, goes into a slide and the 
     passenger door snaps wide, releasing what looks to be a 
     FLOCK OF WHITE DOVES into the wind-whipped sky.

     Only, these ain't birds.  • - ^

                         GRADY
          Oh... my... God! 

     These are PAGES. Seven years of-pages.

     CRABTREE goes into another slide, one-hops the curb, and 
     smashes flat into the weathered GLOVE of BILL MAZEROSKI 
     painted on the front wail of KRAVNIK'S SPORTING GOODS.

     As Hannah Green's RADIATOR EXPLODES, CRABTREE steps free 
     of the car and looks skyward. It's a ticker-tape parade ail 
     the way down the street, ending in the frigid waters of the 
     Ohio River. 

                         GRADY (cont'd)
               (to Vernon)
          I take it back.  Shoot him. 

109     INT. GALAXIE - MOVING

     Vernon drives, Oola at his side. In-the back, CRABTREE 
     puffs philosophically on a Kool while GRADY sits grimly 
     with the sad remains of his manuscript: SEVEN RUMPLED 
     PAGES, one of which bears the watermark of a shoe print.

                         CRABTREE
          Naturally you have copies.

                         GRADY
          I have an alternate version of the first 
          chapter. 

                         CRABTREE
          You'll be all right then.  Look at Carlyle, 
          when he lost his luggage.

                         GRADY
          That was MacCaulay.

                         CRABTREE
          Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those 
          stories.

                         GRADY
          He was never able to reproduce them.

                         CRABTREE
          Bad examples. Look, Tripp, I don't want to 
          depreciate the loss here, but perhaps--in a 
          sense- this--
               (nodding to the pages)
          is for the best.

     Grady's eyes shift, study Crabtree.

                         GRADY
          Kind of a sign, you're saying.

                         CRABTREE
          In a sense.

                         GRADY
          I don't think so. In my experience, signs are 
          usually a lot more subtle.

                         VERNON
          Let me get this straight. All that paper that 
          went into the river. That was the only copy?

                         GRADY
          'Fraid so.

                         VERNON
               (glowering at Crabtree)
          And you're saying it's some kind of sign? What 
          the fuck's the matter with you?

                         CRABTREE
          I'm just saying that sometimes, 
          subconsciously, a person will put themselves in 
          a situation-perhaps even create that situation-
          in order to have an arena in which to work out
          an unresolved issue. It's a covert way, if you 
          will, of addressing a problem.

     Vernon stares at CRABTREE as if he's from another planet.

                         VERNON
          I'll tell you the problem. You behind the 
          wheel. There's your fucking problem.

                         CRABTREE
          That's pretty simplistic, don't you think?

                         VERNON
          Hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights 
          in the middle of the street none of this 
          happens.

                         CRABTREE
          Excuse me. Did you, or did you not, have a gun 
          to his head?

                         VERNON
          He was trying to steal my car!

                         GRADY
          Ail right, all right It's done. There's no 
          need to talk about it. It's done.

     They ride in silence for a moment, then Oola turns, 
     glances at GRADY
     and his little sheaf of pages.

                         OOLA 
          So what was it about? 
               (as GRADY looks up)
          Your book.  What was the story?

     GRADY stares into Oola's sweet, brown eyes.

                         GRADY
          I don't know...

     Oola's brow wrinkles. CRABTREE glances at his old friend, 
     genuine compassion in his eyes.

                         CRABTREE
          What he means is, it's difficult to distill 
          the essence of a book sometimes. It-lives in 
          the mind.

                         VERNON
          Yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, 
          right? I mean, if you didn't know what it was 
          about, why were you writing it?

                         GRADY
          I couldn't stop.

110     EXT. CAMPUS ENTRANCE

     Grady, James Leer's hollow knapsack in hand, stands with 
     CRABTREE at the campus entrance as Vernon and Oola prepare 
     to leave in the Galaxie.


                         GRADY
          Hey, Vernon. Can I ask you a question?

                         VERNON 
          Shoot.

     GRADY glances at little round Oola.

                         GRADY
          Boy or girl?

                         VERNON
          As long as it looks like her, I don't care. 
          You know what I'm saying?

     GRADY watches Vernon give Oola a kiss on the forehead.

                         GRADY
          Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.

                         VERNON
          No sweat. Only do me a favor?

                         GRADY
          Sure.

                         VERNON 
          Stop calling me Vernon.

     CRABTREE leans into Grady, WHISPERS.

                         CRABTREE
          The jacket, Tripp. We need the jacket.

                         GRADY (cont'd)
          Oh, right. Oola. About that jacket...

                         OOLA 
          Yea?

     GRADY looks at the waitress in her pink jersey dress, 
     snuggled up in the silk wedding jacket.

                         GRADY
          It used to belong to Marilyn Monroe. She had 
          small shoulders, like you. Most people don't 
          know that.

     As Oola smiles, pleased, Vernon shakes his head.

                         VERNON
          Man, that book of yours must've been one nutty 
          motherfucking ride.

     Vernon points an imaginary gun, fires a friendly cap into 
     Grady, and pulls away. CRABTREE stands stunned.

                         CRABTREE
          You mind explaining what you just did?

     GRADY watches the shrinking Galaxie sail under a drooping 
     NORDFEST BANNER, lost in thought.

                         GRADY
          Came to my senses. CRABTREE

          Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is 
          James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell 
          to come to his?

                         GRADY
          Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer 
          to jail, Crabs. I know that.

                         CRABTREE
          Do you know he won't expel him?

                         GRADY
          No. But I don't think that matters.

                         CRABTREE
          That's very enlightened, Professor. It's 
          comforting to know that America's children have 
          you for a teacher.

     GRADY blinks, ponders this briefly, then looks toward the 
     buildings of the campus, his VOICE still distant.

                         GRADY
          Nobody teaches a writer anything. You tell 
          them what you know. You tell them to find their 
          voice and stick with it, because that's all you 
          have in the end. You tell the ones who have it 
          to keep at it and you tell the ones who don't 
          to keep at it, too. Because that's the only way 
          to get where you're going. 
               (ruefully) 
          Of course, it helps if you know where you want 
          to go. 
               (thoughtfully)
          Maybe that's the only thing--that and Sara--
          that's made the last seven years worthwhile.

     GRADY slides James' knapsack off his shoulder, smiles 
     cryptically as he considers it. -

                         GRADY (cont'd)
          As for James, he doesn't need me anymore...

     Without warning, GRADY tosses CRABTREE the knapsack.

                         GRADY (cont'd)
          He's got you.

     CRABTREE stares at the saggy green canvas in his hands, 
     watches GRADY walk away.

                         CRABTREE
          Me? What can I do?

                         GRADY
          Gee, I don't know, Crabs...
               (over his shoulder)
          Improvise. You're good at that.

     GRADY continues on, leaving CRABTREE to stand alone, as 
     he walks toward the buildings in the distance.

                         CRABTREE
          I'm sorry, Tripp.

     GRADY stops, turns.

                         GRADY
          You peeked, didn't you?

                         CRABTREE
          I peeked. 

     GRADY considers this. Nods. It-doesn't seem to matter 
     anymore

                         CRABTREE
          It really had the makings, Tripp. There was a 
          lot to admire. I've ...never read anything 
          quite like it.

     If there was a Kentucky Derby for editorial bullshit, 
     Crabtree's last three utterances would finish win, place, 
     and show. And GRADY knows it.

                         GRADY
          You're not just trying to make me feel better?

     CRABTREE looks directly at Grady, his old friend.

                         CRABTREE
          Scout's honor.

     CRABTREE and GRADY stare into each other's eyes. Both are 
     acutely aware of the subtext of this conversation.

                         GRADY
          Well, thanks for that, Crabs.

111     INT. HALLWAY - ENGLISH DEPARTMENT 

     Dead quiet. Gradually, STEPS are heard, coming from the 
     stairwell, then GRADY limps into view.

112     INT. GRADY'S CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER

     GRADY surveys the room. Empty chairs. Empty desks.

     He walks to a WINDOW, the same window he stood at two 
     afternoons ago when reading James Leer's story. A chill 
     breeze pitches the fabric of his shirt as he studies the 
     barren benches and icy walkways of the quad. Finally, he-. 
     turns away, settles behind his desk and, reaching into his 
     pocket, removes the seven remaining pages of his 
     manuscript. He considers them, then folds them in half 
     length-wise. He continues, folding the top right corner 
     down into a triangle along the first crease...

113     EXT. QUAD  

     A moment. Then-from the third floor window-a PAPER 
     AIRPLANE glides into view, soaring then dropping, soaring 
     then dropping, again and again, graceful as a dove.

114     INT. LOBBY - THAW HALL - LATER

     GRADY hobbles into the lobby just as one of the 
     auditorium doors swings open. APPLAUSE SWELLS and he spies 
     Sara standing inside, talking to a STUDENT USHER.

                         GRADY
          Sara!

     Sara turns ...as the door glides shut. As GRADY hustles 
     forward, Q, wine glass in hand, intercepts him.

                         Q
          Grady. I have to tell you. I took another look 
          at Arsonist's Daughter the other night. There's 
          a description of a bald cypress that left' me 
          breathless.

                         GRADY
               (pushing past him)
          Thanks, Q. I felt the same way about the bank 
          teller's breasts in your last one.

115     INT. BACK ROW - AUDITORIUM - THAW HALL

     GRADY enters, but Sara is ...gone. He picks his way 
     behind the back row, scanning the aisles.

                         GIRL'S VOICS 
          Hey, Professor Tripp.

     It's Carrie McWhirty, James' tormentor from workshop. 
     GRADY takes another look around, then drops into the seat- 
     next to her.

                         CARRIE MCWHIRTY
          If you're looking for Hannah, she's on the 
          aisle.

                         GRADY
          No...

     But GRADY looks anyway. Hannah sits a dozen rows down the 
     aisle, hair pulled back in a clip, glorious skin gloaming. 
     The Goatee Kid sits close beside her.

                         CARRIE MCWHIRTY
          Who's that guy she's with? Didn't he used to 
          be in workshop?

                         GRADY
          Jeff. He comes from a long line of tango 
          dancers.

116     INT. MAIN STAGE

     Walter turns over the last page of-his prepared notes.

                         WALTER
          And now, as those of you who've been with us 
          in previous years know, we have a tradition of 
          sorts here at WordFest. I'm speaking, of 
          course, of The Plums.

     An anticipatory BUZZ sweeps through the audience as 
     Walter begins to read from a separate list.

                         WALTER
          This weekend, Susan Lowery, of North Braddock, 
          found a publisher for her children's book. The 
          Loneliest Prawn, Susan, stand up.

117     INT. BACK ROW - THAW HALL^

     As a CHUBBY WOMAN stands to acknowledge the applause, 
     GRADY cranes his neck, searching the sea of seats. To his 
     surprise, he finds CRABTREE sitting prominently in the 
     front row, in his shirtsleeves, smiling his spookily 
     complacent smile. James is next to him, now wearing 
     CRABTREE'S METALLIC SPORTS COAT over Grady's flannel shirt.

                         WALTER
          And Robert Wilkenson--who many of you know for 
          his City Beat column in the Post-Gazette--has 
          found a home with Putnam for his new Three 
          Rivers thriller. Blood Patterns. Robert.

     A SHORT, BALDING MAN stands briefly then Walter's VOICE 
     takes a shift in tone.

                         WALTER
          Now, this next one, I think, is especially 
          exciting to announce, because it concerns a 
          student here at the university. Our own James 
          Leer, a sophomore in English literature, has 
          found a publisher for his first novel, which I 
          believe is called The Lovely Parade.

     GRADY blinks, leans forward, and watches Walter smile 
     warmly toward the front row. CRABTREE gives James a jab in 
     the ribs and slowly, awkwardly, James rises. Stunned, 
     Carrie McWhirty turns to the GIRL next to her.

                         CARRIE MCWHIRTY 
          I have a class with him.

     James hangs-like a scarecrow from a nail, waiting as the 
     APPLAUSE slows, then sputters, then dies out altogether.

                         CARRIE MCWHIRTY
          The guy's kind of an alien probe, if you know 
          what I mean.

     Grady, in a last attempt to save James from himself, cups 
     Hi his hands around his mouth.

                         GRADY
          Take a bow, James!

     James turns, spots GRADY in the back row, then-a sheepish 
     grin on his face--spreads his arms, hangs his head, and 
     takes his first sweet public bow.

                         GRADY (cont'd) 
               (softly)
          Wonder Boy.

                         WALTER
          And finally--and perhaps not least 
          importantly--Terry Crabtree, of Bartizan, has 
          also decided to publish my own book--a critical 
          exploration of the union of Marilyn Monroe and 
          Joe DiMaggio and its function in American 
          mythopoetics-which, tentatively, I've entitled 
          The Last American Marriage.     "

     Wild, obsequious APPLAUSE. GRADY smiles cynically, 
     watches Walter take a brief, dignified bow of his own.     
     . :

                         WALTER 
          Until next year. Thank you, everyone.

     The LIGHTS come up. As the auditorium empties, CRABTREE 
     shakes Walter's hand and Jeff and his goatee escort Hannah 
     Green down the aisle, where she drapes her lovely arms 
     around James.

     GRADY watches them ail, sitting alone in his row, when 
     suddenly Sara appears over James' shoulder. She says 
     something congratulatory, turns, and exits out a side door. 
     GRADY blinks, scrambles up.

118     INT. CORRIDOR - THAW HALL - MOMENTS LATER

     GRADY bursts into the corridor.'

                         GRADY
          Sara!

     Its empty. Quiet. GRADY pauses. Somewhere, a HEAVY METAL 
     DOOR CLOSES. GRADY rushes on.

119     INT. NEW CORRIDOR

     Grady, limping badly, turns a corner and sees a DOOR. He 
     moves to it, pushes past...

120     INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

     ...and finds himself standing in a stairwell. He leans 
     out over the railing, peers down. It's a steep drop, very. 
     steep, ending in a small rectangular space, a kind of 
     basement office, with VENDING MACHINES, PLASTIC CHAIRS, and 
     a COLLAPSIBLE CARD TABLE.

     GRADY turns back to the door he came through, pushes 
     against it. Locked. He sighs, looks back at the stairs, his 
     ailing ankle, then sits. He fishes out the Ziploc of- 
     marijuana, considers the perfectly roiled JOINT floating 
     atop the bag of buds, but, for once, isn't up to it. The 
     SOUND of FOOTSTEPS echoes far below and, hopeful they're 
     Sara's, GRADY pulls himself up, peers over the railing.

     It's Traxler, with a broom, a big plastic bag.

                         GRADY
          Yo, Traxler.

                         TRAXLER 
               (looking up)
          Hey, Professor Tripp.

     GRADY considers the Ziploc in his hand, looks down again.

                         GRADY
          Do you get high, Sam?

                         TRAXLER
          Only when I'm working.

     GRADY hangs-over the railing and lets fly the Ziploc.  It 
     pinwheels through the vortex of stairs, lands at Sam's 
     feet.

                         TRAXLER 
          Holy shit. Are you serious?

                         GRADY
          As a heart attack.

                         TRAXLER
          Thanks-Whoa, Professor Tripp, careful ^here...

     GRADY is still hanging over the railing-but looking dizzy 
     now. His eyelids flutter and he tips forward-a Steinway on 
     a window ledge-and as he starts to drop...

     ...there is a SHARP JERK on his- COLLAR, a SHIRT BUTTON 
     caroms off his cheek, and slowly, he is hauled back.

                         SARA
          Grady, what are you doing, you idiot?

     GRADY looks up into Sara's freckled face.

                         GRADY
          Looking for you.

     He wants to say more, he opens his mouth, but then... ALL 
     GOES BLACK AS SARA'S VOICE CALLS...

     faintly at first, then more forcefully, calling Grady's 
     name, calling so insistently that the earth seems to RUSH 
     upward until we see that she is...

     KISSING him or something, and all goes softly... Blue.

121     INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     GRADY lies in a powder blue paper gown surrounded by blue 
     plastic curtains in a blue room. Through a gap in the 
     curtains, he can see the bottle of-GLUCOSE that drips 
     slowly into his arm, and beyond, a window. Flakes of SNOW 
     fall outside.

     The DOOR SQUEALS, a SHADOW ripples across the blue, then 
     the curtains part and a RESIDENT with a clipboard appears. 
     His NAMETAG says GREENHUT.

                         GRADY
          I passed out.

                         GREENHUT
          You did.

                         GRADY
          I've been doing that a lot lately.

                         GREENHUT
          So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of 
          marijuana, I understand.

                         GRADY
          Do you think that's why I've been having 
          these...
               (grabbing James' term)
           ... spells?

                         GREENHUT
          How long have you been having them?

                         GRADY
          The last month maybe.

                         GREENHUT
          How long have you been smoking marijuana?

                         GRADY
          Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.

                         GREENHUT
          That's probably not the problem, then. What 
          about your lifestyle. Any major changes 
          recently?

                         GRADY
          I've been trying to finish a book...

                         GREENHUT
          And your wife left you.

                         GRADY
          Is that in my chart?

                         GREENHUT
          I spoke with the woman who saved your life. 
          You're lucky she came along when she did.

     GRADY considers the larger ramifications of this 
     statement

                         GRADY
          I know.

                         GREENHUT
               (tapping the glucose bottle)
          You need to see a doctor, Mr. Tripp. An 
          internist. And I think you really ought to 
          consider seeing a therapist, as well.

                         GRADY
          She told you about. . .

                         GREENHUT
          Her dog, yes.

                         GRADY
          Actually, it was her husband's dog...

     Greenhut glances up, looking GRADY in the eyes for the 
     first time, and GRADY
     stops.

                         GREENHUT
          Look, Mr. Tripp. You have a drug problem, all 
          right? On top of that, you have a bite on your 
          ankle that is severely infected. We pumped you 
          with antibiotics so you'll be fine, but another 
          day or two and you might have lost the foot. As 
          for your spells. I'm guessing they're a result 
          of the anxiety you've been experiencing lately.

                         GRADY
          They're anxiety attacks? That's a little 
          disappointing.

                         GREENHUT
          Better luck next time.

                         GRADY
          So is my friend...is Sara still here?

                         GREENHUT
          No. There's no one here.

                         GRADY
          I have to see her. As soon as possible.

     Greenhut studies Grady, calibrating the desperation in 
     his eyes, then takes a quick glance at his watch.

                         GREENHUT
          Look, Mr. Tripp. If you really want to leave, 
          I can't stop you. But I'm going to write you a 
          prescription for a course of ampicillin and I 
          want you to follow it to the end-no matter how 
          stupid you decide to be with everything else. 
          All right?

122     INT. HOSPITAL/BRIDGE WALKWAY - AFTERNOON

     GRADY sits in a WHEELCHAIR, watching the snow fail around 
     him as a NURSE escorts him through the tunnel of glass that 
     connects one building to another.

                         GRADY
          I wonder if you could show me something. 

123     EXT. NURSERY - HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER

     GRADY stares through the glass. There are only TWO BABIES 
     on display, heads dented from natural delivery, skin purple 
     and crazy with veins.

                         GRADY
          Are these the only ones you have?

     The nurse's eyes crinkle.

                         GRADY (cont'd)
          Kidding... 

124     EXT. GASKELL HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

     GRADY pays a TAXI CAB DRIVER, then turns,     looks at 
     the Gaskell house.

125     EXT. FRONT DOOR - MOMENT LATER

     GRADY KNOCKS. Nothing. Peers into the living room window.  
     Dark.  He stands helplessly, then spies the greenhouse, 
     standing ghostly across the yard, feathers of snow drifting 
     onto its roof, melting.

126     EXT. GREENHOUSE - MOMENT LATER12S

     GRADY hobbles to the greenhouse, puts both hands to the 
     glass as he looks inside. Quiet. Empty. Dispirited, he 
     pulls away, but not before leaving...

     ...the IMPRINTS of his hands, perfectly etched in the 
     frost of the glass.

127     EXT. STREET  127

     The snow continues to fall as GRADY lumbers down the 
     street. Finally, wearily, he stops, sits his crippled self 
     on the curb. He plunges his fist into his jacket and. 
     ..straight through the lining, James Leer's silly little 
     pistol at the end of his hand. He considers the pistol, 
     then looks up into the sky.

     GRADY'S POV - of the SKY... 

     ...dark and menacing. Suddenly, a THUNDERCLAP shatters 
     the silence.

     NEW ANGLE - GRADY ...still sitting with the gun in his 
     hand.

                         GRADY
               (as if addressing God) 
          Is that a suggestion?

     GRADY sits, blinking the snow out of his eyes, then TWO 
     SHAFTS of-LIGHT dance across his shoes. A white Citroen 
     DS23 appears.  It passes.  Slows.  Stops. 

     GRADY stares at the car, burbling at the curb, then lifts 
     himself up and makes his way to the driver's window. Sara 
     makes a face, bugging her eyes a little-mad at him, but- 
     not without humor. Then she rolls down the window.

                         GRADY
          I'm so glad to see you, Sara.

                         SARA
          I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you 
          out? Or-is this you improvising again, Grady?

                         GRADY
          I'm through improvising. 

                         SARA
          Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is  it true? 
          Did you lose it all?

                         GRADY
          I lost it ail.

                         SARA
          Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.

                         GRADY
          I know.

                         SARA 
          And you're old.

     Sara strokes his scalp, takes a gray hair between her 
     fingers. Yanks.

                         GRADY
          Ouch. How many?

                         SARA 
          Dozens. It's very sad.

     Sara smiles at Grady, but the mischief leaves her eyes 
     when she looks into his, and-she glances away.

                         GRADY
          I went and looked at-some babies just now.

                         SARA
          Oh?

                         GRADY
               (trying to make her laugh)
          I guess you have to go on faith.

                         SARA
               (she doesn't)
          Some times...

     GRADY studies her as she traces her finger around the 
     HOSPITAL BRACELET still encircling his wrist.

                         GRADY
          Did you tell Walter?

                         SARA
          I told Walter. 

                         GRADY
          Does he still love you?

                         SARA
          It didn't come up. 

     GRADY studies Sara's freckled cheeks, her anxious 
     profile, then turns her chin gently toward him.

                         GRADY
          Well I do. I've always loved you, Sara. I 
          didn't know it at the time, but I'd always been 
          waiting for you. My whole life. Because you're 
          who I need. Because nothing makes sense without 
          you. Because the best moment of every day is 
          the moment I first see your face. And because 
          when you leave a room, there's no reason to be 
          in it any more. It's just a room again.

     Sara cocks her head.

                         SARA 
          Did you just make that up?

                         GRADY
               (shaking his head)
          In the hospital. I "was kind of excited about 
          it at-the time, but then I was on pretty heavy 
          painkillers.

     She frowns good-naturedly. 

                         GRADY (cont'd)
          Even so...it's still true. Every word.

     Sara just nods, looks away, her face unreadable.

                         GRADY (cont'd)
          Sara, I promise, even though commonsense might 
          tell you...

     Sara turns, puts a finger on GRADY's lips...

                         SARA 
          Don't write a page when a paragraph will do.

     GRADY nods, takes her hand. Looks at it as he speaks.

                         GRADY
          You don't deserve me, you know.

                         SARA
          I know, but sometimes... 

     Sara turns, looks at Grady. Her eyes are glistening. 

                         SARA (cont'd) 
          You just go on faith.

     GRADY looks into her eyes, then rises, and we do too, 
     drifting above the streetlights as GRADY limps to the other 
     side of the car and gets in. As GRADY snaps shut his door, 
     the car drifts off, gradually losing itself in- the soft 
     veil of falling snow. After a moment, GRADY and Sara are 
     lost too, nothing more than a blur.


     THE END
