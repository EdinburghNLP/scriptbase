                         (v.o.) As a girl, you see the world 
                         like a giant candy store, filled with 
                         sweet candy and such. But one day you 
                         look around and see a prison and you're 
                         on death row. You wanna run, or scream 
                         or cry. But something's locking you 
                         up. Are the other folks cows, chewing 
                         cud till the hour come and their heads 
                         roll? Or are they just keeping quiet, 
                         like you... Planning their escape?

                         It's called work, princess. Kind of 
                         fun. You might want to give it a go 
                         someday.

                         Hey, Justine. Can I talk to you for 
                         a second?
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         Yeah.

                         I was just curious. Have you ever been 
                         to a Bible study?
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         Yeah.

                         We got a good one going on every Wednesday 
                         at the First Church of Nazarine. Rodney 
                         comes, Benita comes. You got any interest 
                         in reading the Bible?
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         I have my own, you know, beliefs.

                         We don't preach fire and brimstone. 
                         Just the Ten Commandments. We’re not 
                         interested in scaring people. We’re 
                         about loving Jesus.

                         I kinda like my nights to myself.

                         Well, maybe you'll have nights of eternal 
                         hellfire to yourself. Just kidding you. 
                         Drive safe.

                         You stand at the front door and the

                         and the house is green. Or you could 
                         make, like, an invisible paint. Make 
                         the whole house disappear.

                         Fuck you very much.

                         Now, you might be interested in purchasing 
                         some of the products I used today...

                         Well, that'd be a mistake. These are 
                         bargain prices.

                         I hate my job.


                                     HOLDEN
                         That makes two of us.

                         I hate everyone here. I hate Gwen. I 
                         don't know what the hell she's so happy 
                         about. I'm sorry I don't understand 
                         why maniacs get shotguns and shoot everybody 
                         to pieces.

                         Maybe so. You know you're lips are real 
                         pouty, like a woman. And how your eyes 
                         droop off to the side. How old are you?

                         Um, I had to drop out. I had a problem 
                         with drinkin' and stuff. I'll go back. 
                         I just gotta prove to my parents that 
                         I can fly staright. You go to college?

                         No, I was afraid I'd lose Phil if I 
                         went. Now that'd be reason enough to 
                         go. I saw you in the store and I liked 
                         how you kept to yourself. I can see 
                         in your eyes that you hate the world. 
                         I hate it too. You know what I'm talkin' 
                         about?

                         you not listenin? Is there a secret

                         not reading it? Is this your last, best

                         I wonder what it'd be like to be a woman. 
                         All that smooth skin and long hair.

                         here. Maybe every time you smoke a little 
                         dooby, you're killin' our unborn children.

                         on it so it doesn't sweel up and inflame.

                         You're a writer so you have yourself 
                         a goal. I used to lie in bed and imagine 
                         other cities, other jobs I could have. 
                         Other husbands. Now I don't even know 
                         what to imagine anymore. Holden, I have 
                         a husband.

                         know I got good sperm. It's baby-makin 
                         sperm. I suppose it couldn't hurt to 
                         have it confirmed by an expert.

                         was sellin' 'em on the road.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         No thank you.

                         Don't mention it. Hey, Gwen.


                                     GWEN
                         Hey sugar.


                                     HOLDEN
                         Dear Justine. Because of you I'll be 
                         quitting the Retail Rodeo. The last 
                         two days have been the most god-awful 
                         days of my life. I've not been able 
                         to get rid of you in my head. I never 
                         wanted anything so bad, and I have wanted 
                         many things. I'd given up long ago on 
                         being gotten by someone else, and then 
                         you came along. The idea of being gotten, 
                         because of circumstance, will never 
                         get got is the worst feeling I've ever 
                         felt, and I have felt many bad feelings. 
                         I'm sorry I can never see you again, 
                         Justine, forgive me for being so weak, 
                         but that is who I am. Goodbye, Holden 
                         Wurther. If for some reason, you could 
                         change your mind and want to be with 
                         me, body and soul, meet me after work. 
                         I will be waiting for you at five PM 
                         outside Chuck E.Cheese. If you are not 
                         there at five, you will never see me 
                         in your lifetime.
 

                                     JUSTINE

                                     JUSTINE
                         I'm gonna let you off here, okay?


                                     GWEN
                         Okay,You'll meet me inside?


                                     JUSTINE
                         Yeah, you know what I'm gonna do? I'm 
                         gonna park the car, then I'm gonna meet 
                         you inside.

                                     HOLDEN
                         Hey. Oh god, I'm really glad you came.
 
                         

                                     JUSTINE
                         I just ditched Gwen at the hospital.
 
                         

                                     HOLDEN
                         Oh god, thank god.


                                     JUSTINE
                         Where are we goin'?

                                     HOLDEN

                                     JUSTINE
                         This isn't well planned.


                                     HOLDEN
                         Look. I don't know. I don't care I just 
                         wanna hold you.

               (Justine and Holden are in the hotel room and make love.)


               


               (after the made love)


                                     JUSTINE
                         I can't do it.


                                     HOLDEN

                                     JUSTINE
                         I don't wanna... I don't wanna go.
 
                         

                                     HOLDEN
                         Justine. I'm yours. I'm all yours.
 
                         

               (they kiss)


               


                                     PHIL
                         Hey.


                                     JUTSINE
                         Hey.


                                     PHIL
                         Were you been?


                                     JUSTINE
                         Gwen got real sick today. She was throwin' 
                         up all over the store. I had to take 
                         her to the hositpal, and sat with her.
 
                         

                                     PHIL
                         Did she sick up on you?


                                     JUSTINE
                         No.


                                     PHIL
                         Did she sick up on anybody? (chuckles)
 
                         

                                     JUSTINE
                         It's not funny, Phil, this is serious. 
                         I'm gonna go up there tomorrow too. 
                         And the next day.
 

               


                                     JACK
                         Justine? What happened to you?


                                     JUSTINE
                         What?


                                     JACK
                         I went down to St. Catherine's to check 
                         up on Gwen. I looked all over for you, 
                         she was askin' for you.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         Well, how is she?


                                     JACK
                         She was heavin' up until there was nothin' 
                         left to heave. Doctor said she must've 
                         eaten somethin' with some kind of parasite 
                         in it or somethin'.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         I bet it was those blackberries.


                                     JACK
                         They're gonna keep her in there until 
                         she gets better so you're gonna have 
                         to supervise cosmetics.
 

               


               (there they go again)


                                     JUSTINE
                         Stop it, somebody's gonna see!


                                     HOLDEN
                         Who cares, I don't care. I crave you. 
                         I wanna know everything about you. Who 
                         are you?
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         I'm just this woman. I moved to Texas 
                         when I was eleven. My daddy was in the 
                         Air Force.
 

                                     HOLDEN
                         I wanna knock open your head and see 
                         what's inside. I've had so much pain 
                         in my life. I know you have too, I can 
                         see it.
 

                (at the hotel, in bed, 
               probably after they made love)
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         Holden gave me two of his stories to 
                         read. It's like what a story would be. 
                         I was about a boy who was put upon, 
                         his mother was cold and selfish, and 
                         his father wanted him to play football. 
                         Other people didn't get him, especially 
                         girls. Then the boy comes to believe 
                         no one can ever really know him. So 
                         he starts actin' out, drinkin', and 
                         doin' all kinds of drugs. At the end 
                         the boy kills himself but jumpin' over 
                         abridge. The second story was pretty 
                         much the same as the first. Except at 
                         the end, the boy kills himself by drinkin' 
                         a bottle of bug poison.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         Your stories are intense.


                                     HOLDEN
                         I just wanna leave some kind of legacy. 
                         Somethin' great. After that I don't 
                         care what happens to me.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         Don't say that. I wish there was a story 
                         about me. I don't know who would read 
                         it though.
 

                                     HOLDEN
                         I would.


                                     JUSTINE
                         I like this. I like havin' a secret. 
                         You gave me a secret Holden.
 

                                     HOLDEN
                         Seee, now that you met me you're mysterious. 
                         And dark and twisted.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         I'm going to hell, aren't I?


                                     HOLDEN
                         Yes, you are.


               (she rolls on top of him and they kiss)


               


               (they exit the hotel and Justine sees a car)


                                     JUSTINE
                         That's Bubba's truck. Get in the car. 
                         Phil takes that truck to work everyday. 
                         Bubba picks him up, and drops him off. 
                         Why, why would that truck be parked 
                         there?
 

                                     HOLDEN
                         I don't know.


                                     JUSTINE
                         If he finds out about us....


                                     HOLDEN
                         I won't let him hurt you.


                                     JUSTINE
                         He's big, Holden. He'll kill you. He'll 
                         beat me, but he'll kill you.
 

                                     HOLDEN
                         You can't worry about somethin' that 
                         hasn't even happened yet.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         I gotta go to the hospital.


                                     HOLDEN
                         Okay. (leans in to kiss her; she pulls 
                         away)
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         Don't! I mean he could be followin' 
                         us.

                         Justine! Poor lady. She just passed.
 
                         

                                     JUSTINE
                         Who?


                                     CORNY
                         Gwen! She just passed away.


                                     JUSTINE
                         What do you mean? I thought she had 
                         a stomach ache?
 

                                     CORNY
                         It got worse. She was on life support 
                         all day.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         I don't understand.


                                     CORNY
                         It's God's will, Justine. No one can 
                         understand it. It was just Gwen's time 
                         to fly away home.

                         Retail Rodeo employees this is Jack 
                         Fields, your store manager. Before we 
                         open today, I just want to share some 
                         terrible and shocking news. One of our 
                         best employees, Gwen Jackson, died yesterday. 
                         Gwen was a real class act. She had a 
                         good attitude, she had ideas. We're 
                         all gonna miss her. Now, if any of y'all 
                         need to collect you thoughts and remember 
                         Gwen. GWEN, then today's the day. You'll 
                         be excused from work and we'll just 
                         have to do without you. Gwen, this one's 
                         for you.
 

               (music comes over PA)


               


                                     JUSTINE
                         Holden had the notion to go to Gabler's 
                         Creek, skinny dippin' and makin' love. 
                         He said we'd be like Adam and Eve, rollin' 
                         around around in the sticks and the 
                         dirt and bein' one with nature. He was 
                         so fixed on the idea thateven when the 
                         clouds started rollin' in, and the sky 
                         was gettin; dark, he kept on swimmin'. 
                         All my thoughts turned to death. I thought 
                         of Gwen's body, rottin' away. I thought 
                         of how nice a person she was, so full 
                         of life and good will. If there was 
                         a heaven, Gwen would be there. Givin' 
                         makeovers and offerin' up helpful advice. 
                         I thought if I died today, what would 
                         happen to me? A hateful girl. A selfish 
                         girl. An adultress. A liar.
 

               


               (Justine and Holden are running towards the car and get in)
 
               

               


               (Next scene they're in the car; back seats, kissing)


                                     JUSTINE

                         Makin' one out of two.


                                     JUSTINE
                         (sighs) I haven't thought this through.
 
                         

                                     HOLDEN
                         Justine, will you leave him?


                                     JUSTINE
                         And go where?


                                     HOLDEN
                         Away. With you on my arm, my folks'll 
                         think I've changed. They'll stop thinkin' 
                         I'm suck a loner, I got a girlfriend, 
                         a pretty one, who knows me and likes 
                         me. And they'll be so happy, they'll 
                         give me money to write my novel.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         But where will we GO?

                         Only by me. I'll be immortal and then 
                         like JD Salinger I'll just vanish.

                         too creative on the P.A. Maybe she'll 
                         watch her P's and Q's over here. If 
                         not she's out on her but. Now you listen 
                         to Justine, sister.

                         No, I just need to know if that's your 
                         usual way of wearing it all big and 
                         high. If it is then I'll just put more 
                         makeup on your chin to off-set. Now, 
                         you're gonna want to take a whole bottle 
                         of this home wtih you. It's got quite 
                         alot of ingredients in it so you're 
                         getting a good deal. It's got Ginco 
                         extract in it, do you know what that 
                         is?

                         No.


                                     CHERYL
                         It's extract of the Ginco and it makes 
                         your skin real slick so that any liquid 
                         will roll right off, be it water or 
                         lemon juice or urine. I'll put that 
                         in a bag for you.

                         discussion going tonight. If man is 
                         made in God's image, what does that 
                         say about God?

                         Because I don't want to. Now, can we

                         couple of Devil worshippers.

                         Why? Beacause we forgot our Bibles is 
                         why.

                         forgive us.

                         Yeah, well, they may not, alright. So 
                         can we please just get the shit outta 
                         here?

                         found out about us.

                         I'm starting to wonder if you even want 
                         to go. I'm startin' to think you don't 
                         get me.

                         You do, you do get me you just don't 
                         want to me 'cause I'm too intensified 
                         for you! Justine, who cares, who cares 
                         if someone finds out. We don't have 
                         to live like this, Justine. I know what 
                         it's like to go home every night and 
                         feel like you're hidin' out. We can 
                         leave all this behind...

                         That's easy for you to say, Holden, 
                         you are not married.

                         gonna go crawlin' back?!

                         You're so fucking afraid it makes me 
                         sick. Don't give up on us.
 

                                     JUSTINE

                                     JUSTINE
                         Thanks.


               


               (Justine arrives at Bubba's. He opens the door and his dog, Bitz, 
               is barking.)
 

                                     BUBBA
                         Easy Bitz, easy Bitz. Back in your corner! 
                         Back in your corner! Back in your corner, 
                         Bitz! Come on in. I wanna show you somethin'. 
                         Sit. (Yells at dog again) I'm in shock.
 
                         

                                     JUSTINE
                         Why?


                                     BUBBA
                         You know why.


                                     JUSTINE
                         Bubba sat like that for what seemed 
                         like ten years before he began to speak. 
                         Finally, when he opened his mouth, he 
                         talked a blue streak about the ruin 
                         that was his life. He talked about how 
                         he loved Phil, and how he loved me. 
                         And how he always wanted a girlfriend 
                         just like me, and to be a guy like Phil, 
                         to this imaginary girl like me, that 
                         he never found. Then he wen on about 
                         givin' up your dreams and how it's all 
                         a part of gettin' older. Bubba had given 
                         up on his dream to be like Phil, and 
                         accepted his fate as Bubba, always and 
                         forever. Then, last week, a door that 
                         remained shut swung wide open. Bubba 
                         thought this no chance coincidence, 
                         a cosmic force was at work. The sounds 
                         of me makin' love to a man that wasn't 
                         Phil was like a shout in Bubba's ear 
                         from the creator himself. What it meant, 
                         or what to do, or why Bubba didn't know. 
                         All he knew was that he hated me for 
                         poisoning the well of idealism that 
                         he had drunk from for so long. I was 
                         no longer Bubba's image of perfection. 
                         To him I was just a liar, and a whore, 
                         and that sickened him. But on the other 
                         hand he loved me for opening his eyes 
                         and releasing him from the bitter chains 
                         of evny that bound him to Phil. Phil 
                         was no superman, just a cuckhold, and 
                         a foll, and that was beautiful. Bubba 
                         felt that there was just one thing left 
                         for us to do. Something that would solve 
                         both our problems and end this whole 
                         tragic cycle.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         Bubba, I am not gonna sleep with you.
 
                         

                                     BUBBA
                         But don't you see? This is my chance, 
                         for liberation.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         But, one person's liberation is another 
                         person's, well, badness. There's just 
                         no way.
 

                                     BUBBA
                         I'm gonna have to tell Phil then.


                                     JUSTINE
                         Why?


                                     BUBBA
                         He's my best friend. I can't keep him 
                         in the dark about somethin' this big. 
                         He's a cuckhold.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         You wanna cuckhold him yourself!


                                     BUBBA
                         Well that's different. That isn't about 
                         him. That's about my salvation. Look, 
                         you've got your choice to make. Either 
                         destroy your marriage, and break your 
                         husband's heart. Or have sex with me 
                         right now.
 

               


               (Bubba is yelling at the dog again, and saying Justine's name)
 
               

                                     JUSTINE
                         Oh god! There was someone in the window! 
                         Did you not see?
 

                                     BUBBA
                         You're paranoid.


                                     JUSTINE
                         I gotta go.


                                     BUBBA
                         Phil is never gonna find out about any 
                         of this. Don't fret. (the dog is still 
                         barking)
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         Get this damn dog away from me!


               


                                     BUBBA
                         You're lookin' at a free man, Justine. 
                         A free man.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         Great. Good for you.


                                     BUBBA
                         Thank you. (Yelling at dog again.)
 
                         

               


               (TV sounds as Phil comes out of the bathroom, still brushing 
               his teeth)
 

                                     PHIL
                         I'm nervous.


                                     JUSTINE
                         You're nervous? Why?


                                     PHIL
                         'Cause I gotta go to that doctor tomorrow 
                         and jism into a cup, that's why. What 
                         if I can't do it?
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         You can do it.


                                     PHIL
                         You know, If you said you'd help me 
                         I'd feel alot less nervous. It's gonna 
                         be on your lunch hour anyway.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         Okay.


                                     PHIL
                         You didn't even say nothing about the 
                         TV bein' fixed.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         Oh. Is it? Thanks.


                                     PHIL
                         You're welcome.


               


                                     JACK
                         Well aren't you a fright? Justine, you 
                         talked to Holden lately? He didn't show 
                         up for work today, I wanna know what 
                         gives. I know you two are friends.
 
                         

                                     JUSTINE
                         We're not friends.


                                     JACK
                         You eat lunch together every day.


                                     JUSTINE
                         No, we don't.


                                     JACK
                         Well, if you see him, tell him Jack 
                         Fields is lookin' for him.
 

               


               (Justine gets in the car and is shocked when she sees Holden 
               in the car, more depressed than ever.)
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         Oh my god. What are you doin'?


                                     HOLDEN
                         You're a hooker, you hooker.


                                     JUSTINE
                         I saw you. You followed me.


                                     HOLDEN
                         So, how many guys you gettin' with? 
                         You gettin' with every guy in the state?
 
                         

                                     JUSTINE
                         No, Holden, this is all because of you. 
                         He had me over a barrel. If I didn't 
                         sleep with him he was gonna tell Phil 
                         about us!
 

                                     HOLDEN
                         I'm so alone!


                                     JUSTINE
                         You've gotta get a hold of yourself! 
                         Are you drunk?
 

                                     HOLDEN
                         Yes, I'm drunk! And I'll be drunk every 
                         day until the day I die! What do you 
                         care?! You jump on any pecker that's 
                         put in front of you!
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         It's not what you think.


                                     HOLDEN
                         I saw everything. Oh god. Oh god.


                                     JUSTINE
                         Look, go home. Sober up. And meet me 
                         after work.
 

                                     HOLDEN
                         Where you goin'?


                                     JUSTINE
                         I gotta help Phil with his sperm.

                         What?


                                     JUSTINE
                         Just go. Go!

                         I can't share you, Justine! Maybe with 
                         one man but not with a whole bunch of 
                         'em!

                         why. But, from where I stand, what happened 
                         yesterday was a wonderful thing.

                         I stack up against Phil? You know, how 
                         do I stack up where it counts?

                         It's Justine. (gets into the room)
 
                         

                                     PHIL
                         C'mon. I can't do this on my own. I 
                         need help.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         You've never done it on your own?


                                     PHIL
                         Not in a place like this! Not where 
                         I have to hand over the results! Just, 
                         let me hold your boob.
 

               (holds her boob; Justine's face is full of pain)


                                     JUSTINE
                         Ah, they're sore. (Justine looks fed 
                         up with everything)

                         death.

                         Is it your period?


                                     JUSTINE
                         Nah, it's stress.


                                     CHERYL
                         This job is stressful. I'm breaking 
                         out.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         You're breakin' out 'cause you put so 
                         much makeup on your face.
 

                                     CHERYL
                         Maybe you're pregnant.


                                     JUSTINE

                         You know, sometimes, I think to myself, 
                         at least it can't get any worse. But 
                         it can. I can worse. As long as you 
                         can say you've hit rock bottom you can.
 
                         

                                     JUSTINE
                         Oh my god, Blackberries.


                                     HOLDEN
                         A blind man can go deaf. A widow can 
                         lose her children. Babies starve and 
                         they never get food. They never get 
                         any food. They just come into the world 
                         and they die.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         Calm down, Holden!


                                     HOLDEN
                         I can't calm down! I'd be easy if I 
                         was a hooker like you. I could calm 
                         down all over town.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         Hey, hey! I am not a hooker.


                                     HOLDEN
                         I know you're not. I'm in agony.


                                     JUSTINE
                         Why?


                                     HOLDEN
                         What do you mean 'why'? I thought you 
                         hated your life.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         I do. I mean I'm depressed but... You 
                         are really depressed.
 

                                     HOLDEN
                         I'll kill him. I'll murder him in his 
                         sleep. I'll kill my parents, I'll steal 
                         the money whatever it takes. You just, 
                         just whatever you want as long as it's 
                         you and me. Please don't forsake me 
                         Justine.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         Oh... I, I promise. (car is parked somewhere; 
                         Justine and Holden are sitting on the 
                         car, Holden's smoking)
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         I realized then that Holden was at best 
                         a child, and at worst a demon. If I 
                         was ever gonna go straight I'd have 
                         to ditch him. Sometimes, to get back 
                         on the road to redemption, you have 
                         to make a few pit stops.

                         Have a blackberry.

                         We need a plan. We can't keep livin' 
                         day to day. We gotta chart a course 
                         and we just gotaa stick....

                         Have a blackberry, Holden!


                                     HOLDEN
                         But, they're dirty. (hesitating, he 
                         eats a blackberry and then smiles) They're 
                         sweet. If I could only get my hands 
                         on some money, someone could just tell 
                         me the answer. I gotta do. But If I 
                         ever do, I end up thinking about it 
                         instead. I gotta do. But do what? (Justine 
                         pushes the blackberry he's about to 
                         eat away from his mouth) What...? What 
                         was that for?
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         They looked dirty. I, I think I saw 
                         a bug in them or something.

                         I'm worried about Holden. Tom. I'm worried 
                         about Tom. I just befriended Tom, recently, 
                         and now, well, I think he's mentally 
                         ill. He has this idea in his head that 
                         we've had some sort of affair. Which 
                         is crazy because I'm, I'm married. He's 
                         been sayin' all sorts of strange things, 
                         and makin' threats. And drinkin'. And, 
                         and I just think he would be better 
                         off in a place where people, professionals, 
                         could take care of him. Otherwise, he's 
                         just gonna get himself in trouble.

               (Holden goes into his room with a crazy smile on his face. He 
               starts to laugh. When he hears the phone ring again, he stops 
               smiling and starts to look like he's thinking of something.)

                         from the safe. They blew the thing open 
                         with a gun.

                         he robbed his folks too. You in on it?

                         Holden stole fifteen thousand dollars 
                         from the safe last night. Did you have

                         him Justine. On many the occasion. I

                         Corny's got a camera in that storage 
                         room. That Bible thumpin' pervert's 
                         been watchin' us the whole time.
 

                                     HOLDEN
                         Well, we're outta here! Justine, I got 
                         over twenty thousand dollars! I got 
                         a gun, what else?!

                         gonna crash. (takes a right turn and 
                         stops the car) I'm pregnant, Holden.
 
                         

                                     HOLDEN
                         It's my baby.


                                     JUSTINE
                         Not necessarily.


                                     HOLDEN
                         Yes, it is. You know it is.


                                     JUSTINE
                         Even if it is, you cannot raise a baby 
                         on the run.
 

                                     HOLDEN
                         Yes, you can. I mean, you can't raise 
                         a baby here. You know that. Justine. 
                         You hate your husband. You hate your 
                         job. You love me, so let's go.

                         I can't go tonight. I gotta pack my 
                         things and I'd have to get more money.
 
                         

                                     HOLDEN
                         Well, then tomorrow. I'll go to the 
                         motel and wait for you. Just be there 
                         by noon.

                         work out. I know it. I almost forgot. 
                         This is a story of your life. You inspired

                         How it all came down to this, only the 
                         devil knows. Retail Rodeo was at the 
                         corner on my left, the motel was down 
                         the road to my right. I closed my eyes 
                         and tried to peer into the future. On 
                         my left I saw days upon days of lipstick 
                         and ticking clocks. Dirty looks and 
                         quiet whisperings. and burning secrets 
                         that won't ever die away. And on my 
                         right, what could I picture? The blue 
                         sky, the desert earth streching out 
                         into the eerie infinity. A beautiful, 
                         never ending nothing.

                         What's going on in the bedroom? Looks 
                         like a twister hit it.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         Oh yeah. I was doin' laundry.

                         I thought we were robbed. Why aren't 
                         you at work?
 

                                     JUSTINE

                         Retail Rodeo? You know that guy?


                                     JUSTINE
                         No.


               


                                     JACK
                         Attention Retail Rodeo employees this 
                         is JAck Fields, your store manager. 
                         As most of you all know by now, We lost 
                         another employee yesterday. Holden was 
                         a thief and a disturbed young man, and 
                         what happened was a sad thing. Perhaps 
                         we can learn a lesson from this tragedy, 
                         like don't steal and don't be disturbed. 
                         The important is to move on. Like dozens 
                         of those who quit. This one's for you 
                         Holden.

                         I thought we were gonna get a day off 
                         and go to the movies....
 

               


                                     JUSTINE
                         What?


                                     BUBBA
                         I was just at your house and the mail 
                         came. Phil was opening letters, and 
                         he opened this bill from the credit 
                         card company. And F&$%. Please don't 
                         tell him about us, Justine. Please. 
                         Please. I love Phil. I love him more 
                         than myself. Please have mercy on me.

                                     PHIL
                         Don't you love me? Don't you love me 
                         at all?
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         You're the only man alive that I love.
 
                         

                                     PHIL
                         Oh god. Please don't tell me it's not 
                         my baby.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         It's your baby.

                         Who is he?


                                     JUSTINE
                         It doesn't matter.


                                     PHIL
                         Yes, it does. Was it some guy from work?
 
                         

                                     JUSTINE

                         Yeah, I know who it was. It was that 
                         Bible guy, wasn't it? The Nazarine. 
                         That's why you were actin' so spooked.

                                     PHIL
                         I just gotta escape, you know. You ever 
                         feel like that? Like you gotta escape?
 
                         

               


                                     JUSTINE
                         What are those?


                                     CHERYL
                         Fake eyelashes. Extra long.


                                     JUSTINE
                         Just do it normal for once?


                                     CHERYL
                         You want me to make the other cheek 
                         purple to even it out?
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         No.


                                     CHERYL
                         D'you hear about Corny? He was goin' 
                         home after Bible study last night and 
                         two beefy guys with painted faces pulled 
                         up in a truck and jumped him.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         That's terrible.


               (shot of Justine in the bathroom of Retail Rodeo. She's sitting 
               on one of the toilets, she's wearing fake eyelashes and just 
               looks trashy.)
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         That day I read the story Holden wrote 
                         for me. It was kinda different from 
                         the other one, but kinda the same. It 
                         was about a woman who was put upon. 
                         Whose job was a prison, and whose life 
                         had lost all meaning. Other people don't 
                         get her, especially her husband. One 
                         day she meets a boy who is also put 
                         upon, and they fall in love. After spending 
                         their whole lives not getting got, with 
                         one look they get eachother completely. 
                         In the end, the boy and the girl run 
                         away together in the wilderness, never 
                         to be heard from again.
