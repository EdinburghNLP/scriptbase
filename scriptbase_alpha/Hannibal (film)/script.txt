                ....I didn't realize I said it out
                loud.

                          DRUMGO
                Said what?

                          STARLING
                I'm an orphan. 

                          DRUMGO
                Well, then, you're a lucky girl, cause
                that baby's gone to be your family.
                    (TO THE RECEPTIONIST) 
                ...I've got an appointment....

     THE RECEPTIONIST IS GONE, DRUMGO GOES TO PEER OVER THE
     RECEPTION DESK. 

     ANGLE ON STARLING 

                          STARLING 
                That is a lovely thing to say. 

                          DRUMGO
                Waal... 

                          STARLING 
                It gets, um... it gets so lonely sometime. 

                          DRUMGO 
                    (SITS.  COMFORTS THE CHILD)
                What'd you say, hon...? 

                          STARLING 
                I said sometime it gets so... 

                          DRUMGO 
                Well, don't you worry, cause that baby's
                gone take care of that.

     SHE BRUSHES BACK THE HAIR FROM THE SIDE OF HER FACE.

     MICROPHONE. 

     ANGLE ON STARLING, AS SHE HITCHES HERSELF UP IN HER SEAT,
     AS IF TO FIND A COMFORTABLE POSITION.

     ANGLE INSERT. 

     ON THE BACK OF HER DRESS.  WHERE WE SEE THE PRINT OF A
     SQUARE BOX, AS STARLING'S HAND MANIPULATE A SMALL KNOT
     THROUGH THE DRESS.  NEXT TO IT WE SEE THE PRINT OF A
     PISTOL UNDER THE DRESS.

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING AND DRUMGO.

     STARLING, AS SHE FIDDLES WITH THE BARRETTE ONCE AGAIN.

                          STARLING (cont'd) 
                I wonder if you could just, sit down, 
                talk with me a moment... 

     ANGLE XCU ON STARLING, HOLDING THE BARRETTE, AS SHE SPEAKS TO
     DRUMGO. 

                          STARLING (cont'd) 
                Cause, you know, I'm sitting here all
                alone.  Do you know what I mean?
                    (PAUSE) 
                Cause I feel it's getting late for 
                me... do you know...?  That I've Waited
                Too Long... 

     ANGLE ON DRUMGO, AS SHE STANDS IN THE EMPTY RECEPTION AREA,
     AND LOOKS AT IT AND THEN BACK TO STARLING . 

                          DRUMGO
                    (PAUSE) 
                Waited too long, hon...?
                    (PAUSE) 
                    (SHE LOOKS AT STARLING ) 

                          STARLING 
                How's your child? 

     STARLING STANDS, AND MOVES TO LOOK OUT OF THE WINDOW.

     ANGLE XCU ON DRUMGO, AS SHE LOOKS AT STARLING.

     ANGLE, HER POV 

     THE DRESS, STUCK BY SWEAT, TO STARLING'S BACK, REVEALS THE 
     PISTOL AND TRANSMITTER.

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE SITS DOWN AGAIN.

                          DRUMGO
                ...what? 

                          STARLING 
                I said how's your baby...? 

                          DRUMGO 
                You want to hold him...? 

                          STARLING
                Waal... 

                          DRUMGO 
                'bout time you learned... 

     SHE HANDS THE BABY TO STARLING. 

     SHE GOES INTO THE CHILD'S DIAPERBAG AND TAKES OUT A PISTOL,
     AND LEVELS IT AT STARLING, AS SHE MOVES TO LOOK OUT THE
     WINDOW. 

                          DRUMGO (cont'd) 
                ...where's your friends...? 

     SHE MOVES TO STARLING, AND FRISKS HER, AND REMOVES HER
     PISTOL, AND THE TRANSMITTER FROM THE BELT AT HER BACK... 

                          DRUMGO (cont'd) 
                ...you're here all by yourself, honey.... 

                          STARLING
                Give it up, Evelda.

                          DRUMGO 
                Well, you know my name, honey, but I
                don't know yours... 

                          STARLING
                Give it up. 

                          DRUMGO
                Hey, you know, I never thought of
                that... 

     SHE STARTS GETTING INTO THE NURSES GARB. 

                          DRUMGO (cont'd) 
                Ain't this a picture, though, cause you
                know you ain't the first girl, ever got
                lef, in a position, waiting at the 
                doctor's.  You can't trust men, child,
                don't you know that.... old as you
                are...? 

     SHE WALKS BACK TOWARD STARLING, SCOOPS UP HER CHILD, PEEKS
     OUT THE WINDOW, AND STARTS FOR THE DOOR. 

                          DRUMGO (cont'd) 
                Cause, see, they'll always let you down.
                Terrible thing, to do to an orphan... 

     SHE LEANS BACK TOWARD STARLING, GRABS HER HAIR, AND PULLS HER
     BACK AND KISSES HER ON THE LIPS, AND RETIRES AND EXITS.

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE LOOKS OUT OF THE WINDOW.  AT A CAR, WHICH
     IS IN THE FAR END OF THE PARKING LOT, IT ACCELERATES, AND
     SCREECHES UP TO THE DOOR, AND EVELDA, CARRYING HER CHILD,
     GETS IN TO THE STILL MOVING CAR, WHICH STARTS TO TAKE OFF.

     ANGLE EXT THE MIDWIVES CENTER.

     STARLING, CROUCHING AT THE DOOR, RETRIEVES A BACKUP WEAPON
     FROM HER ANKLE HOLSTER.  SHE EMERGES FROM THE DOORWAY. 

     ANGLE 

     IN THE PARKING LOT, DRUMGO AND CHILD, GETTING HAULED INTO 
     THE CAR.  A FIGURE IN THE BACKSEAT OF THE CAR, SHOOTING OVER
     THE ROOF, APACHE STYLE, FIRES AT STARLING, AS THE CAR PEALS
     OUT OF THE PARKINGLOT.

     STARLING TAKES COVER.

     BEAT. 

     STARLING, ALONE, WALKS INTO THE NOW EMPTY PARKINGLOT.  SHE
     SITS ON A LOW CONCRETE DIVIDER.  HOLD.  A VAN PULLS IN. 
     FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER CAR, AND TEN SWAT CLAD COPS PILE OUT,
     AND APPROACH STARLING.

     STARLING SLOWLY LOOKS UP. 

                          STARLING 
                ....where were you...? 
                    (SHE LOOKS AT HER WATCH. ) 

                          SWAT OFFICER 
                    (AS SEVERAL OTHER OFFICERS
                     MOVE INTO THE MIDWIVES
                     CENTER.) 
                ...we, we didn't hear the go-ahead. 

                          STARLING 
                    (AS SHE HANDS HIM THE SMALL
                     RADIO TRANSMITTER) 
                Yeah, well, you didn't get it cause your
                radio went dead.  The backup plan was,
                17.45, you guys are the Cavalry... 

     SHE GETS UP AND WALKS AWAY FROM THE DOORSTEP, TO A SEDAN,
     WHICH IS PULLING UP.  AS SHE GOES, SHE TAKES OFF THE FAKE
     BELLY SHE HAS BEEN WEARING.

     ANOTHER SWAT AGENT TAKES THE RADIO AND LOOKS AT IT.

                          SECOND SWAT OFFICER 
                ...what'd you do, sweat it out, short 
                out the leads...?  Got a little hot in
                there.....? 

     SHE FLINGS THE FAKE STOMACH AT HIM.

                          SECOND SWAT OFFICER (cont'd) 
                ...what happened to Right to Life...?
                    (HE LAUGHS) 

     STARLING ROUNDS ON HIM, HITS HIM SEVERAL TIMES, AND THROWS
     HIM TO THE GROUND.

                          STARLING 
                What happened to Right to Life?  What 
                happened to right to my life...?  I'm in
                there, carrying the mail for all you 
                drugstore cowboys, si'in in a van playin
                with each other's Velcro... 
                    (THE OFFICER STARTS TO GET UP) 
                You wanna get up, you wanna get up?
                Here I am... 

     TWO FBI TYPES GET OUT OF THE NEWLY ARRIVED SEDAN. 

                          FBI TYPE
                What happened to the girl...? 

                          STARLING 
                    (AS SHE GETS INTO THE SEDAN)
                Get me out of here... 

     INT CONFERENCE ROOM FBI HEADQUARTERS DAY. 

     STARLING IS NOW DRESSED IN A T-SHIRT AND JEANS.  SHE HAS
     CLEANED HERSELF UP.  KRENDLER, A CLEAN-CUT STUDENT COUNCIL
     TYPE AROUND FORTY IS HOLDING FORTH.  AROUND THE CONFERENCE
     TABLE ARE THE FATHERLY JACK CRAWFORD, AND VARIOUS OTHER
     POLITICOS. 

     KRENDLER GESTURES AT THE TABLE, WHICH HOLDS THE BURNT OUT
     RECEIVER, THE FAKE "PREGNANT" STOMACH WORN BY STARLING, 
     AND A PHOTO, HE HOLDS THE PHOTO.  WE SEE IT IS DRUMGO, A
     SURVEILLANCE PHOTO. 

                          KRENDLER 
                And you let her get away. 

                          STARLING 
                Sir, with all due respect.... 

                          CRAWFORD 
                Just a moment.  Starling didn't... 

                          KRENDLER 
                Well, well, well, well, well, she went 
                in there, to apprehend a Dangerous Felon.
                Went in there with her gun, Came out,
                without the Felon, without the gun... 

     STARLING STARTS TO SPEAK, AND CRAWFORD STILLS HER. 

                          CRAWFORD 
                I had... one moment, I had an agent in
                there, waiting for backup from... 

                          KRENDLER 
                ...she couldn't act on her own..?  Where 
                is the FBI's vaunted Initiative, where..? 

                          STARLING
                Sir: 

                          CRAWFORD 
                Shut up, Starling... 

                          STARLING 
                I could have acted on my own.  I was
                told... 

                          CRAWFORD 
                Starling, I've ordered you to shut... 

                          STARLING 
                ..I was instructed that this was a 
                Joint Task Force, the FBI, BATF, and the
                Mayor's Special... 

                          KRENDLER 
                You find something objectionable to
                working in partnership with.... 

                          STARLING 
                Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out
                there, dealing with an armed and
                dangerous... 

                          KRENDLER 
                You were given backup....

                          STARLING 
                THEN WHERE WAS IT?  I'm sent out 
                there... I'm told that the arrest must
                be a joint... 

                          KRENDLER
                I'm saying: ... and what's wrong with that. 

                          STARLING 
                And I'm telling you:  You wanna throw a 
                Birthday Party:  Every kid gets a Chance
                to Play, that's fine, but... 

                          KRENDLER
                No, I don't get you... 

                          STARLING 
                Due respect, you don't, sir, your 
                precious Joint Operation.  FBI, ATF, DC
                SWAT, it's alphabet soup, we don't have
                the same Radio Freqs, we don't... 

                          KRENDLER 
                Oh, is this your political position,
                you're opposed to Joint... 

                          STARLING 
                I'm opposed to being part, Your Rainbow
                Coalition.  Evelda Drumgo?  I could of 
                took her down in a snap of the fingers--
                But-- I'm out there, and my Rules of 
                Engagement...

                          MAYOR'S REP 
                The Rainbow Coalition, what is that,
                excuse me... 

                          KRENDLER 
                And what are you, our Token Woman? 

                          STARLING 
                I don't mind being the token woman, what 
                I'm suggesting, send me out there with a
                token man... who are these Warriors, 
                ¥our cobbled together Strike Force?  I'm
                in the room with a fugitive felon... 

                          CRAWFORD
                Starling...? 

                          STARLING 
                One moment, and they're at the Seven- 
                Eleven.  They botched the fallback plan,
                they... 

                          KRENDLER 
                And, fine, alright, and fine... what are
                youdoing, this whole time? 

                          STARLING 
                Sir, I was, as instructed, waiting for

                She threw a punch at a man on the team. 

                          CRAWFORD 
                Well, you know, that happens, on the
                street. 

                          KRENDLER 
                What is that supposed to mean...? 

                          CRAWFORD 
                I think its meaning is clear. 

                          KRENDLER 
                What, you're saying she was overwrought. 

                          CRAWFORD
                That could be. 

                          KRENDLER 
                Because that's understandable, because.
                She blew the raid. 

                          CRAWFORD 
                She was there, alone, sir, she was in a

                control your rage....

     STARLING STARTS TO LAUGH.

                          STARLING 
                Well, that would be a poor choice,
                wouldn't it...

                Because, you know, you can't understand. 

                          PSYCHIATRIST
                Then tell me. 

                          STARLING 
                Well, you know, you know, you know, the
                point is:  I can't tell you.  Cause you 
                haven't been there.  You haven't done it.
                And that's all there is.

                    (PAUSE.  SHE CHECKS HER NOTES) 
                ...and to have done it, means, can mean 
                to accept, not only danger, but 
                betrayal...?

                          STARLING
                ....that's right. 

                          PSYCHIATRIST

                          STARLING 
                No.  That's right.  That's all part of
                it. 

                          PSYCHIATRIST 
                Then, that being so, why is today 
                special?  Why have you come back to see 
                me?  Is it that new file they gave you? 

                          STARLING
                I don't think so. 

                          PSYCHIATRIST 
                Then what brings you back? 

                          STARLING

                     PLEASE, REVEAL IT)
                I think it is a phrase you used with
                that woman.  You told her you were an
                orphan.

                     HEAD)

                No, I don't think so...

                          PSYCHIATRIST 
                It is you who have betrayed...

                That's... I appreciate your help, but...
                    (SHE RISES) 

     INT COPBAR NIGHT.

     STARLING IS DRINKING WITH ARDELIA MAPP, A CONTEMPORARY, AND
     ARDELIA'S BOYFRIEND, JIM.  THERE ARE VARIOUS EMPTY BOTTLES
     IN FRONT OF THEM.

     STARLING IS LOOKING DOWN AT THE FILE WE SAW EARLIER, AND
     SCOWLING. 

     MAPP AND JIM LOOK ON.  A WAITRESS COMES BY. 

                          MAPP 
                You want another drink, honey...? 

                          STARLING 
                I want the same drink.  Cause it did me
                good... but I already drunk it, so,
                barring that, yes, I would like another. 

     THE WAITRESS EXITS. 

                          STARLING (cont'd) 
                B'cause it's one of the few things, in
                the world, which are effective
                an'predictable. 

                          MAPP 
                What's that, Baby?

                          STARLING
                Alcohol.  Where both its life-enhancing 
                And its life destroying qualities...
                    (SOUND OF CHEERING, THEY LOOK
                     TO THE SIDE) 
                ...not unlike some Hindu God... 

     MAPP PICKS UP THE FILE, AND LOOKS AT IT.

                          MAPP 
                I guess the only thing is Suck it
                Up... 

                          STARLING 
                Well.  Excellent... I'm... 

     THERE IS A SOUND OF RENEWED CHEERING, AND HEADS TURN.

     ANGLE THEIR POV.

     A TABLE OF THE "INTERNATIONAL POLICE SCHOOL" STUDENTS, 
     DRINKING, AND WEARING "GIMME CAPS," WHICH ARE PASSED OUT BY
     AN ARRIVING JOHN BRIGHAM.

     ANGLE. 

     BRIGHAM, BEING CONGRATULATED AND THANKED BY THE VARIOUS
     FOREIGN COPS. 

     BRIGHAM PASSES OUT CAPS WHICH ARE BLAZONED "FBI ACADEMY,
     QUANTICO, VIRGINIA."

     WE SEE BRIGHAM NOTICE STARLING, ET AL, AND EXCUSE HIMSELF.

     ONE OF THE FOREIGN COPS CALLS AFTER HIM. 

                          FOREIGN COP
                Semper Fi.

                          BRIGHAM 
                ...truer words were never spoken... 

     CAMERA TAKES HIM TO THE STARLING TABLE, WHERE STARLING,
     DRUNK, IS LOOKING THROUGH THE FILE.

                          STARLING 
                Our Mister Frendler to, to, to humiliate
                me, though....

                What else's he goin to do with his day,
                he can't work, and he won't steal... 

     BRIGHAM SITS, AND KISSES STARLING. 

                          STARLING
                Oh baby, oh baby....

                          BRIGHAM 
                Bad beat today. 

                          STARLING 
                Hey, I'm fine.  Whaddizit, you, how's
                your day, our gallant International
                Neighbors...? 

                          MAPP 
                Look what they put her on... 

     SHE TAKES THE FILE FROM STARLING AND HANDS IT TO BRIGHAM.

                          STARLING 
                No, that is code-word material, that's 
                what that is....

     ANGLE ON BRIGHAM AS HE PICKS UP THE FILE. IT CONTAINS A 
     CATALOGUE FROM AN AUCTION HOUSE, AND WE READ:  FROM A
     COLLECTOR:  DRAWINGS AND SKETCHES BY HANNIBAL LECHTER:
     THESE NEVER-BEFORE OFFERED ITEMS WERE ORIGINALLY IN THE HIGH-
     SECURITY CELL OF THE MASS KILLER... (ETC.) 

     AND, BELOW, WE SEE VARIOUS ARCHITECTURAL SKETCHES.

     ANGLE ON STARLING, BRIGHAM, AND SO FORTH.

                    (OF THE AUCTION CATALOGUE)
                What does this mean?

                          MAPP
                Slap her wrist, they got her, chasing
                down the auction houses, drawings of

                          BRIGHAM
                Why's she chasing'em down...? 

                          MAPP

                          BRIGHAM 
                That's weak.  The man's long gone, he's
                not coming back, buy up a drawing... 

                          STARLING 
                No, but that is the Will of the 
                Institution.  To instill a proper 
                Probity, Humility, deference, in the

                N'I don't care, you see, what all they

                That's what you think... 

     EXT STARLING'S APARTMENT BUILDING NIGHT. 

     BRIGHAM AND STARLING WALKING UP, STARLING SWAYING A LITTLE,
     HE HOLDS OUT HIS HAND FOR THE KEY, AND SHE GIVES IT TO HIM. 

                          STARLING
                ...mos kind... 

     WE HEAR A CAR COMING UP THE STREET BEHIND THEM.

     BRIGHAM OPENS THE DOOR. 

     THERE IS A FLASH OF LIGHT FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE.  AS 
     STARLING IS ABOUT TO ENTER.  SHE PUSHES BRIGHAM OFF TO THE
     SIDE OF THE DOOR, AND UNHOLSTERS HER PISTOL. 

     BEAT. 

     STARLING LOOKS AT BRIGHAM WHO LOOK UNCOMPREHENDING.  ANOTHER
     CAR IS HEARD COMING UP THE ROAD, AND WE SEE ITS HEADLIGHT 
     SHINE ON AND REFLECT FROM A MIRROR INSIDE STARLING'S DOOR. 

     BRIGHAM LEADS STARLING INTO THE HOUSE. 

     HE CLOSES THE DOOR, AND TAKES HER TO THE SOFA. 

     SHE SITS, AND PICKS UP A PHOTOGRAPH IN AN EASELFRAME FROM THE 
     COFFEETABLE. 

                          STARLING (cont'd) 
                Hey, now, what was I afraid of... I'm 
                shooting at shadows... 

                          BRIGHAM 
                Is that what you're afraid of...? 

     ANGLE INS ON THE PHOTOGRAPH, SHOWS A TALL HANDSOME MAN IN
     WESTERN HAT, WEARING A BADGE, HIS HAND ON THE SHOULDER OF A
     YOUNG BLONDE GIRL.

     ANGLE ON STARLING, AS SHE PUTS THE PHOTO DOWN. 

                          STARLING 
                Then you tell me, then. 

                          BRIGHAM 
                You want me to solve all your problems
                tonight...? 

                          STARLING
                I feel... 
                    (SHE STARTS TO LAUGH) 
                I feel they're Out to Get Me... 

                          BRIGHAM 
                And who is "they?" 

                          STARLING
                ...they're sending me.  Out to get
                Shot.  Hounding me.... they're...
                    (PAUSE) 

                          BRIGHAM 
                ...the whole world's out to get you... 

                          STARLING 
                How crazy is that. 

                          BRIGHAM 
                Well, you wanna shoot back, it give you a
                big target... 

                          STARLING
                    (SLEEPILY) 
                How crazy is that....

     ANGLE, INS. ON THE LECHTER FILE, AND THE PHOTO OF HANNIBAL
     LECHTER. 

     WE SEE BRIGHAM PUT IT DOWN ON THE TABLE NEXT TO THE PHOTO.
     HOLD, LIGHTS GO OFF. 

     BEAT.  STARLING'S HAND COMES INTO THE FRAME, SWEEPS THE
     LECHTER PHOTO AND FILE ONTO THE FLOOR, AND REPLACES IT WITH
     THE PHOTO OF THE WESTERN GARBED MAN AND THE LITTLE BLONDE
     GIRL. 

     BEAT. 

     THE LIGHT GOES ON AGAIN. 

     WE SEE STARLING SWING TO A SITTING POSITION ON THE COUCH. 
     SHE SIGHS.  SHE SHAKES HER HEAD TO CLEAR IT, AND SHE PULLS
     THE HANNIBAL FILE TO HER.  SHE PICKS UP A PENCIL, AND A PAIR 
     OF READING GLASSES FROM THE TABLE, AND BEGINS MAKING NOTES
     ON THE FILE. 

     ANGLE INS. 

     THE AUCTION CATALOGUE, AN FBI FILE, READING, "SALE OF STOLEN
     HANNIBAL LECHTER MATERIAL."

     EXT VIRGINIA HIGHWAY DAY. 

     STARLING'S FBI SEDAN SPEEDING PAST, ON AN EMPTY COUNTRY ROAD.

     THE CAR PULLS OVER ONTO THE SHOULDER.

     ANGLE INT THE CAR. 

     STARLING, TAKING OUT A MAP.  SHE LOOKS AT THE MAP.  LOOKS 
     AROUND.  SHE THROWS THE CAR INTO REVERSE, AND REVERSES
     SEVERAL HUNDRED YARDS QUICKLY. 

     ANGLE INT THE CAR. 

     STARLING LOOKS FROM THE MAP ACROSS THE ROAD.

     ANGLE HER POV. 

     A BARELY DISCERNIBLE BREAK IN THE FOLIAGE, BEAT, THEN 
     STARLING' S CAR PULLS ACROSS THE ROAD, AND INTO THE POV AND
     ENTERS THE BREAK. 

     ANGLE EXT THE CAR. 

     EMERGING FROM A THICK WOODS, THE CAR IS HINGED BY THE CAMERA
     ONTO THE PARK OF A COUNTRY ESTATE, THE CAR DISAPPEARS INTO A
     SMALL DIP IN THE LANDSCAPE.

     ANGLE EXT THE CAR, AT A GATEHOUSE, PREVIOUSLY HIDDEN BY THE
     CONTOUR OF THE LAND.  WE SEE A SMALL DECREPIT GATEHOUSE IN
     STONE, AND, BEYOND IT, A FLIMSY AND ANCIENT BARRICADE, AN
     OLD GAMEKEEPER TYPE IN TWEEDS COMES OUT OF THE GUARDHOUSE.
     HE IS CARRYING A MUG OF COFFEE AND HAS A NAPKIN TUCKED INTO
     HIS COLLAR.  HE REMOVES THE NAPKIN AND APPROACHES THE CAR. 

     STARLING FLASHES HER CREDENTIALS TO THE OLD MAN, WHO HOLDS
     A CLIPBOARD. 

                          STARLING 
                Special Agent Clarice Starling, to see
                Mason Verger. 

     THE MAN AMBLES BACK INTO THE GATEHOUSE.

     ANGLE INT THE GATEHOUSE, THE OLD MAN ENTERS, AND CAMERA
     PULLS BACK TO SHOW, IN A ROOM OFF THE MAIN ROOM, THE FIT
     BODYGUARD TYPES, WATCHING STARLING ON A TV MONITOR.  THERE IS
     A RAFT OF ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT IN THE ROOM, AND A RACK WITH
     SEVERAL ASSAULT RIFLES ON IT.  ONE OF THE GUARDS IS TYPING
     ONTO A COMPUTER TERMINAL.  HE LOOKS AT THE RESULT, AND
     GLANCES UP AT STARLING, ON THE SCREEN, AND NODS "OKAY" TO THE
     OLD MAN.  THE OLD MAN AMBLES OUT TO THE BARRIER, HAVING
     PICKED UP AN OLD CLIPBOARD AT WHICH HE SQUINTS. 

     THEN, SATISFIED, HE RAISES THE BARRIER, AND STARLING'S CAR
     GOES THROUGH.

     EXT A MAGNIFICENT COUNTRY ESTATE HOUSE.

     A POTATOCHIP VAN IS PARKED TO ONE SIDE IN THE WIDE DRIVE.
     AN OLD RETAINER HOLDS OPEN THE DOOR FOR STARLING, AS SHE
     EXITS FROM HER SEDAN, AND HE SHOWS HER INTO A LARGE 
     OPEN MORNING ROOM, IN WHICH WE FIND TWENTY YOUNG CHILDREN
     OF VARIOUS RACES, ROMPING ON A SELECTION OF NEW TOYS. 

     CAMERA TAKES STARLING THROUGH A MODERN KITCHEN, WHERE 
     SEVERAL WHITE UNIFORMED COOKS ARE WORKING HAPPILY, ONE IS
     OPENING A VAST TIN OF POTATOCHIPS.  ONE OF THEM IS REMOVING A
     TRAY OF COOKIES FROM THE OVEN, SEVERAL TYKES WAIT HAPPILY
     NEARBY.  THE COOK WITH THE TRAY OF COOKIES GIVES STARLING
     A WIDE GRIN.

     THE RETAINER TAKES STARLING PAST THE KITCHEN, TO A DOUBLE
     DOOR, WHICH HE OPENS TO REVEAL A CORRIDOR BEYOND, AND A 
     LARGE FIT MAN IN HIS THIRTIES, WEARING AN ORDERLY'S WHITES,
     COMING TOWARD THE CAMERA.

                          CORDELL 
                Agent Starling, would you come with
                me...? 

     CORDELL BOWS TO THE OLD RETAINER, WHO RETIRES.

     CORDELL AND STARLING WALK DOWN THE CORRIDOR.

                          STARLING 
                The children...? 

                          CORDELL 
                ...they're from Baltimore.... 

                          STARLING 
                I've never heard that he... 

                          CORDELL 
                It's not something he wants to 
                publicize, Ma'am.  It's just something he
                does. 

     BEAT. 

                          STARLING 
                I won't take much of his time. 

                          CORDELL 
                He's glad to help.  ...it's just a 
                question of his physical condition.  You
                Understand... 

     CAMERA TAKES STARLING DOWN A CORRIDOR LINED WITH
     HUNTINGPRINTS.  AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR AN OLD WOMAN
     SITS IN A WOODEN CHAIR, KNITTING. 

     THEY HAVE STOPPED.  WAITING FOR THE WOMAN TO LOOK UP. 
     STARLING'S GAZE IS DRAWN BY AN OLD, CREWEL-WORK "SAMPLER"
     FRAMED ON THE WALL BY THE OLD WOMAN'S CHAIR.  AND OBVIOUS
     ANTIQUE.  IT READS: 

     "DO NOT GIVE INTO ADVERSITY.  DO NOT TRUST TO PROSPERITY."

     ANGLE ON CORDELL AND STARLING, AS STARLING LOOKS AT THE
     SAMPLER, AND THE OLD WOMAN LOOKS UP FROM HER KNITTING. 

     SHE SITS IN FRONT OF A HALF-OPENED DOOR, WHICH WE SEE IS
     THE DOOR TO A LINEN CLOSET.

                          CORDELL (cont'd)
                ...y'get enough breakfast, Rosie...? 

     BEAT.  XCU ON THE OLD WOMAN, AS SHE LOOKS AT STARLING, AND 
     THEN NODS TO CORDELL, AS IF TO SAY, "THAT IS THE CORRECT 
     CODE."

     ANGLE INS.

     HER HAND DROPS TO THE BACK OF THE WOODEN CHAIR, AND PRESSES 
     A BUTTON CONCEALED IN THE LEG.

     ANGLE 

     THE GROUP IN THE CORRIDOR, THE "LINEN CLOSET," OPENS, TO 
     REVEAL, BEYOND IT, WHAT APPEARS TO BE A SURGICAL FACILITY,
     OR HIGH-TECH HOSPITAL ROOM. 

     INT THE HIGHTECH ROOM.

     THERE IS A NURSE, SITTING AT A STATION, MONITORING VARIOUS
     LIFESIGN DISPLAYS.  SHE LOOKS UP BRIEFLY, AS CORDELL AND
     STARLING ENTER . 

                          NURSE
                    (TO CORDELL) 
                Five minutes... 

     CORDELL NODS, AND TAKES STARLING DEEPER INTO THE ROOM.  WE
     BEGIN TO HEAR THE SUSURRUS OF A MECHANICAL BREATHING
     APPARATUS.  CAMERA GOES WITH STARLING INTO THE ROOM, WHERE WE
     SEE A HOSPITAL BED, WITH A SCREEN IN FRONT OF IT, AND 
     VARIOUS TELEVISION DISPLAYS ABOVE IT, ANGLED TO BE SEEN FROM
     THE BED. 

     STARLING APPROACHES THE BED, AND LOOKS DOWN AT THE FIGURE
     IN IT.  WE SEE HER FACE, BUT THE FIGURE IS SCREENED.  THE
     FIGURE, VERGER, SPEAKS BREATH BY BREATH, WITH AN OBVIOUS
     ELECTRONIC ENHANCEMENT.

                          VERGER 
                Aren't they beautiful, Miss Starling... 

     STARLING LOOKS UP AT THE CHILDREN PLAYING.

     ANGLE HER POV. 

     ONE OF THE CHILDREN FALLS OFF A SMALL PLASTIC SLIDE, AND 
     CRIES, A NURSE RUNS TO HIM.

                          VERGER (cont'd) 
                Well, now, you see, one of them's hurt.
                And what will make it better?  Love.
                Isn't that odd.
                    (PAUSE) 
                He think's he's hurt his knee--but the 
                assurance, the assurance, the assurance
                that someone cares  (WHEEZE WHEEZE)
                Suggests the hurt was elsewhere. 

                          STARLING 
                Mr. Verger, thank you for your time. 

                          VERGER 
                For the worst hurt, of course, that 
                which will not heal, is the conviction
                no one cares.

                          STARLING 
                I've come to see you, sir, about an
                Auction... 

     SHE HOLDS UP THE CATALOGUE TO HIM.

     ANGLE INS 

     "DRAWINGS AND MEMORABILIA RELATING TO THE SERIAL KILLER, 
     HANNIBAL LECHTER."

     ANGLE 

     ON CORDELL, AS HE COMES CLOSE, DONNING SURGICAL GLOVES, AND 
     TAKES THE CATALOGUE, AND HOLDS IT TOWARD VERGER. 

                          VERGER
                Ah, yes, ah yes.  Our Doctor Lechter...
                And have they sent you, once again to
                capture him?  How terrible for you... 

                          STARLING 
                No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why
                do you say how terrible? 

                          VERGER 
                Because we must leave the past in the
                past.  (WHEEZE WHEEZE) 
                    (CORDELL TURNS A PAGE) 
                Ah.  And here we have artifacts of, yes,
                my own encounter with him...

     CORDELL TURNS THE PAGE QUICKLY. 

                          VERGER (cont'd) 
                No, no.  That's alright.  Yes.  Lechter's
                drawings of me.  Before... and, of 
                course, after... Now:  you are not sent
                to pursue him.  Then your visit baffles
                me. 

                          STARLING 
                Sir, various drawings, done by Dr. 
                Lechter, while in prison, stolen from the
                prison after his escape, have surfaced 
                and are being sold at auction.  Several
                large reserve bids have been placed on
                them.  I have to ask if you've placed
                those bids. 

                          VERGER
                Because? 

                          STARLING 
                Because if it was not you, then, perhaps
                it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim
                his own property. 

                          VERGER 
                And why would you suspect me, of this
                ghoulishness? 

                          STARLING
                Because, sir, you are the only one of his
                victims who lived.  And because you have 
                large resources. 

                          VERGER 
                Large resources, Starling, which I prefer 
                to devote elsewhere....

     STARLING LOOKS UP, AS WE SEE THE IMAGE ON THE TELEVISION 
     CHANGE TO THE CHILDREN EATING THE COOKIES, AND THE IMAGE
     CHANGES AGAIN TO SHOW A SMALL DISPENSARY, AND THE KNEE OF THE
     CHILD WHO FELL BEING BANDAIDED BY A NURSE.
 
                          STARLING
                Due respect, sir... 

     SHE PRODUCES A COPY OF THE WANTED:  HANNIBAL LECHTER POSTER
     WE SAW AT THE FBI. 

                          STARLING (cont'd)
                Due respect, after your, after your... 

                          VERGER
                My encounter. 

                          STARLING 
                Someone offered three million dollars
                bounty on Dr. Lechter's head.
                    (PAUSE) 

                          CORDELL 
                The identity of the person offering the
                bounty was never established. 

                          VERGER 
                Yes, but we know who it was, and I will
                tell you, Agent Starling, what you know
                to be true.  I offered the bounty.  It
                was illegal, and, worse, it was wrong. 
                And I thank God every day that I did not
                compound my sinful life by the stain of
                a murder.  Do you (WHEEZE) Agent
                Starling:  do you know God?
                    (PAUSE) 

                          STARLING
               ...sir...?

                          VERGER 
                Isn't it funny?  You can look on my
                face (WHEEZE WHEEZE) which you would 
                grant me, is the most hideous sight you
                will see in what I hope is a long life. 
                You can look at me.  Which shows (WHEEZE)
                a Strength which must come from strong
                (WHEEZE) strong convictions.  (WHEEZE)
                But you shy when I say the name of
                God. 

     THE NURSE COMES UP, HOLDING THE TAPE OF A LIFESIGNS 
     MACHINE, SHE NODS TO CORDELL AND INDICATES THE MONITORS.

                          NURSE 
                    (TO STARLING)
                ...I'm sorry.. 
                    (MEANING, YOU MUST GO.) 

                          STARLING 
                Yes, then, you're saying that you
                haven't bid upon these drawings.

                          VERGER
                I have not, I would not.  For life
                (WHEEZE) life goes on Starling.  And,
                wait, wait, I wish to talk to you... 
                I'm... (WHEEZE)  (TO THE NURSE, WHO IS 
                TAKING STARLING'S ARM) One moment.  I was
                afflicted, do you see, but my affliction
                was not in my meeting with your Dr.
                Lechter.  I was afflicted before. 
                Before.  Do you see?  In my arrogance.
                Do not (WHEEZE) Do not curse God when
                you are humiliated.  Listen to me:
                embrace it, and you embrace life....
                Listen, and you hear the word of
                God... 

     STARLING IS LED AWAY BY THE CONCERNED NURSE.  CORDELL LINGERS
     BEHIND, AT AN UNSEEN BEHEST OF VERGER. 

     THE NURSE STARTS PREPARING A HYPO AT HER STATION.

                          STARLING 
                ...will he be alright...? 

     THE NURSE, DISTRACTED, NODS, AND RETREATS TOWARD VERGER
     WITH THE HYPO.

     CORDELL COMES OUT TO STARLING.

     INT CORRIDOR, COUNTRY HOUSE, DAY.  STARLING AND CORDELL ARE 
     WALKING, BEYOND THEM, WE SEE VARIOUS CHILDREN PLAYING UNDER
     ADULT SUPERVISION.  A CARETAKER TYPE IS HOLDING A SMALL
     GOAT, WHICH THE CHILDREN ARE PLAYING WITH. 

     CORDELL OPENS THE GLASS DOOR, AND HE WALKS STARLING THROUGH
     THE SCENE OF THE CHILDREN AND THE GOAT. 

                          CORDELL 
                Mr. Verger wanted me to give you 
                this...

                Yes, fine, of course he can read the
                note.  His Italian is admirable, for a
                straniero.  But is he familiar with...

                Institution, which he now graces us with
                his bid to Direct, a note from Guido de
                Cavalcanti.  Would he recognize it, I
                think not. 

     ANGLE ON DR. FELL, STILL SEEN FROM THE REAR, AS HE TAKES A
     SILK SQUARE FROM HIS BREAST POCKET, AND CLEANS HIS HALF-
     GLASSES, THEN FOLDS THEM AND PUTS THEM AND THE SQUARE BACK
     IN HIS POCKET.

                Fell...?

     HE TAKES SEVERAL PACES, TO LOOK AT THE NOTE IN A SHAFT OF
     SUNLIGHT.
 
     HE IS STANDING BESIDE THE STATUE OF JUDITH AND HOLOFERNES. 
     HE NODS AT THE NOTE, AS IF CONFIRMING SOMETHING.  THEN HE 
     LOOKS UP.

                Cavalcanti replied publicly to Dante's 
                first sonnet.  Do you know it, Professor
                Sogliato?  I believe it's worth your 
                time:  Listen to the way he makes an
                instrument of the Italian vernacular, 
                which he called the vulgari eloquentia--
                the eloquent voice of the people: 
                Allegro me sembrava amor tenedo/Meo core
                in mano, e ne la braccia avea/Madonna
                involta in un drappa dormedo/Poi la 
                svegliava a d'esto ardeno/Lei paventosa 
                umilmente pascea/Appreso gir lo ne vedea 
                paingendo.  If Dante had written to a 
                Cavalcanti, it would, of course, have 
                been to Andrea, the most literary of his 
                brothers....

                          SOGLIATO

                In the hope, that someday, I should come
                across such a note.  I thank you 
                gentleman for your kind attention, and

                          RICCI 
                ...will have to face the Studiolo, in
                their meeting next week.  And I, for
                one, wish you the best. 

     FELL SHAKES HIS HAND, AND STARTS DOWN THE STAIRCASE.

     CAMERA GOES WITH HIM, WE HEAR PAZZI VO.

                          PAZZI 
                Dottore... 

     FELL TURNS, AND PAZZI COMES TO CATCH UP WITH HIM.

                          PAZZI (cont'd) 
                Pazzi, Rinaldo, Commendatore,
                Prefatura... 

                          FELL 
                Of course, Commendatore... 

     CAMERA TAKES THEM DOWN THE STAIRS, AS THEY TALK.

                          PAZZI 
                Could you tell me:  did you ever meet
                your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...? 

                          FELL 
                I never met him.  I knew him only from
                his writings. 

                          PAZZI 
                I know that the officers who first 
                investigated his disappearance searched
                for a note, a farewell note, a suicide 
                note... 

                          FELL
                ...yes. 

                          PAZZI 
                You have taken over his offices, is that
                not so? 

                          FELL 
                It is only temporary, until my
                confirmation by... 

                          PAZZI 
                Of course, in his offices, if you come 
                across anything, any personal papers of
                his, anything, however trivial, would
                you contact me, please... Are his 
                personal effects still at the Palazzo? 

                          FELL 
                Yes.  Packed and with an inventory.
                    (HE HESITATES, AND LOOKS AT

     PAZZI AND FELL WALK OUT OF THE MUSEUM.

     ANGLE EXT THE MUSEUM. 

                          PAZZI 
                I'll have them picked up.

     PAZZI GESTURES TO HIS COLLEAGUE. 

                          PAZZI (cont'd)
                May we drop you? 

                          FELL 
                Thank you, I am most happy to walk in
                this most magnificent of cities. 

     FELL STARTS PULLING ON HIS GLOVES, HE HANDS HIS SKETCHBOOK 
     TO PAZZI FOR A MOMENT.  PAZZI LOOKS DOWN.

     ANGLE PAZZI'S POV 

     FELL'S LEFT HAND, HAS A SCAR ON THE BACK IN THE SHAPE OF A 
     3. 

                               PAZZI 
                May I ask you a personal question, Dr.
                Fell? 

                               FELL 
                If your duty requires it. 

                               PAZZI 
                You have a recent scar on the back of 
                your hand.

                               PAZZI 
                You looked oddly at me, back on the
                landing. 

                               FELL 
                Yes, it must be hard to be a policeman.
                Is it hard?  Must one, then, be
                constantly suspicious? 

                               PAZZI 
                Why did you look at me that way?

                I saw a man in disheveled clothing, but
                clean.  Just dressed--in the middle of 
                the... 

     FELL SHAKES HIS HEAD, ASKING TO HAVE THE QUESTION
     WITHDRAWN.

                               PAZZI

                               FELL 
                    (SHRUGS, SMILES) 
                I saw a man, somewhat fatigued.
                Quickly dressed, a bit dishevelled.  In
                the middle of the day.
                    (SMILES)
                An old story.  And then I saw the 
                clothing was fresh--therefore:  a man who 
                dressed at home.  And then I remarked
                the new wedding ring.  And so:  the 
                story gave me pause.  A lovely story.  A 
                new, and a beloved wife.  I wish you joy. 
                    (FELL STARTS TO EXIT) 

     PAZZI WALKS WITH HIM. 

                          PAZZI 
                You assemble this, on the instant, from
                these few observations? 

                          FELL
                    (SHRUGS) 
                I'm a historian.  It is our task to 
                assemble the seemingly unconnected into 
                the obvious. 

                          PAZZI
                ...your scar..? 

                          FELL 
                My scar is a war-wound. 

                          PAZZI
                How so? 

                          FELL 
                Carpal-tunnel syndrome.  From a life of 
                typing.  Commendatore.  History,
                a hazardous profession. 

     FELL AND THEN PAZZI STOP.

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                You are a Pazzi of the Pazzim are you
                not? 

                          PAZZI 
                Yes.  How did you know? 

                          FELL 
                You resemble a figure from the Della 
                Robia Rondels, in your family's chapel at
                Santa Croce. 

                          PAZZI
                It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John
                the Baptist.  You have seen the chapel? 

                          FELL 
                I have had the honor. 
                    (HE BOWS AND STARTS OFF.
                     PAZZI GOES AFTER HIM.) 

     FELL TURNS TO HIM. 

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                I wondered that an officer of your 
                exalted rank should come, so late,
                into the case. 

                          PAZZI
                And?  Then? 

                          FELL 
                I wonder no longer.  You were out of the
                country. 

                          PAZZI 
                How could you know? 

                          FELL
                I sense... 
                    (HE TOUCHES HIS NOSE) 
                The faintest whiff of a perfume, whose
                base, whose base, whose base is 
                "Hamamelis" ... it is witch-hazel--such 
                a clean scent.  No, not a European scent.
                I would say it is a scent of the New
                World.  I would say, you have been in
                America.  Have I struck home? 

                          PAZZI 
                You know America? 

                          FELL 
                ...you have brought this perfume... 
                brought this perfume.  Back.  Back from
                America.  To your New Wife... 
                    (HE PICKS UP HIS HAND, AND 
                     GLANCES DOWN AT PAZZI'S
                     WEDDING RING.) 
                You have given it to her, and some of...
                    (HE SMILES) 
                Some of 'her perfume' has found its way
                back onto you.  Lucky man.  Lucky man,
                indeed. 

     HE BOWS, AND STARTS TO TAKE HIS LEAVE, FROM THE STARTLED
     PAZZI.  PAZZI COMES TO HIS SENSES, AND HANDS A CARD TO FELL. 

                          PAZZI 
                Should you come across anything which... 

                          FELL 
                You will be the first I call. 

     FELL TURNS TO LEAVE, TURNS BACK, AND TAKES HIS HAND AND,
     GENTLY RUBS IT ON THE LAPEL OF PAZZI'S SUITJACKET, HE THEN,
     DELICATELY, HOLDS THE HAND UNDER HIS NOSE, AND NODS, AS IF
     IN AGREEMENT WITH HIMSELF. 

     HE NODS, AND WALKS OFF INTO A PARK. 

     ANGLE ON PAZZI, WHO LOOKS AFTER FELL.  HE WALKS BACK TOWARD
     THE CAR.  HE TURNS, TO LOOK AFTER FELL, AND WE SEE HE IS
     STANDING BY A LINE OF PEOPLE, A QUEUE, UNDER A BANNER WHICH
     PROCLAIMS, "ATROCIOUS INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE." 

     PAZZI SHAKES HIS HEAD, AS IF TO CLEAR IT, AND STARTS TOWARD
     HIS CAR, WHERE COP ONE OPENS THE OOOR FOR HIM. 

     ANGLE 

     ON FELL, AS CAMERA TAKES HIM INTO THE PARK, WHICH, WE SEE,
     IS A CEMETERY. 

     HE SITS ON A BENCH, AND TAKES OUT HIS SKETCHBOOK, AND BEGINS
     TO DRAW. 

     ANGLE HIS POV. 

     A PIECE OF FUNERAY STATUARY, THE LION, HOLDING THE BIRD IN
     HIS MOUTH. 

     ANGLE ON DR. FELL, SKETCHING.  TIGHT. 

     HE SKETCHES, HE RAISES HIS HAND TO HIS NOSE AND INHALES, AND
     NODS AGAIN. 

     ANGLE, FROM THE SIDE, WE NOW SEE THE STATUE AND FELL'S
     DRAWING.  HE IS DRAWING, NOT THE STATUE, BUT A SKETCH OF
     CLARICE STARLING. 

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

     AN ARMY FATIGUE JACKET OVER ORDERLY'S WHITES.  (BARNEY) 

     ANGLE 

     STARLING, STANDING AT A BUSSTOP, READING A PAPER.

     ANGLE INS. 

     IN THE PAPER IS SECRETED A PHOTO OF BARNEY, ON FBI XEROX 
     FORM, WITH HIS NAME, AND DESCRIPTION.

     ANGLE 

     STARLING WAITS AT THE BUSSTOP.  BARNEY PASSES IN FRONT OF 
     HER, AND CONTINUES WALKING.  STARLING FOLDS THE PAPER AND
     GOES AFTER HIM. 

     ANGLE 

     RUNDOWN RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD, DAY. 

     BARNEY, NOW HOLDING A SMALL BAG OF GROCERIES, CROSSES THE 
     STREET. 

     WE SEE STARLING IN THE BG. 

     BARNEY STOPS, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD.  WE SEE HE IS 
     LOOKING UP OVERHEAD.

     ANGLE INS HIS POV. 

     A DOVE, CIRCLING IN THE SKY.

     ANGLE XCU.

     BARNEY LOOKING UP, PUZZLED, AND THEN HE LOOKS DOWN.

     ANGLE HIS POV. 

     IN THE ROAD AHEAD, A DEAD DOVE. 

     BARNEY WALKS INTO THE POV, PICKS UP THE DOVE, AND WALKS TO A
     SMALL RATTY VERGE OF PARK.  HE PUTS THE DOVE DOWN, LOVINGLY
     IN THE GRASS, AND WE WATCH, AS THE OTHER DOVE LANDS ON A
     FENCE, NEARBY. 

     BARNEY STARTS TO WALK TOWARD THE LIVE BIRD.

     ANGLE 

     OVER THE BIRD, ONTO BARNEY, WITH STARLING WALKING UP BEHIND 
     HIM. 

     BARNEY HESITATES, HIS BACK STILL TO STARLING.

                          BARNEY 
                Are you attracted by Death?
                    (PAUSE) 
                It is the one great mystery, is it not? 
                Anyone who would say otherwise must be a
                hypocrite.  Don't you think...? 

     HE TURNS FOR THE FIRST TIME AND LOOKS AT HER. 

                          BARNEY (cont'd) 
                ...or are you only attracted by power...
                    (HE CHANGES HIS TACK AND TONE.) 
                How are you, Agent Starling? 

                          STARLING 
                Ah, Barney:  you've got a good mernory. 

                          BARNEY 
                You know why that is?  Because there
                are so few things I need to forget. 
                Would you agree, for the record, that I
                have not been read my rights? 

                          STARLING 
                I have not read you your rights. 

                          BARNEY 
                Would you mind saying that into your
                bag...? 

     STARLING STARTS TO OPEN HER BAG, AND SPEAKS INTO IT.

                          STARLING
                I hereby acknowledge that... 

                          BARNEY 
                And now I have "dociled" you, have I
                not?  By forcing your obedience. 

                          STARLING 
                    (SMILING) 
                Then why did you chose to inform me of
                it...? 

                          BARNEY
                To show... 
                    (PAUSE) 
                in my ability to squander.  What one
                might deem an advantage... that my
                strength is greater than yours... 

                          STARLING 
                Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...? 

                          BARNEY 
                If you'll come down the street I will
                make you a cup of coffee. 

     INT BARNEY'S APARTMENT DAY. 

     AS THEY ENTER, THE APARTMENT WITH MANY DEADBOLTS.  STARLING 
     ENTERS WARILY AND TAKES A SEAT WITH HER BACK TO THE WALL, IN
     THE SMALL STUDIO. 

     AS BARNEY BEGINS MAKING COFFEE.

                          BARNEY 
                You almost took down Evelda Drumgo.

                          STARLING 
                Well.  Word gets around. 

                          BARNEY 
                ...what hindered you...? 

                          STARLING
                It wasn't my day. 

                          BARNEY 
                Perhaps you did not have the support
                you required.

                          STARLING 
                It's a poor workman who blames his tools. 

                          BARNEY
                Or, perhaps... 

                          STARLING 
                ...how are things at the Hospital? 

                          BARNEY 
                It's a growth business. 

                          STARLING
                What have they got you doing? 

                          BARNEY
                Orderly. 

                          STARLING 
                I would have figured you an R.N. by now,
                or, maybe Med School. 

                          BARNEY 
                I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous
                professions. 

                          STARLING 
                    (TAKES OUT A NOTEBOOK) 
                You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in 
                Dr. Lechter's prison ward. 

                          BARNEY 
                Yes, I presumed it was about him. 

                          STARLING 
                ...you...

                I'm struck by your phraseology.  I did 
                not last with him.  I was privileged to
                enjoy his company during that time.

                valued our time together, because I was
                civil.

                Did you ever think, did you think, after
                he escaped, he would come after you?

                He told me, he preferred to Eat the Rude.
                Or:  "natural composting."  Do you think
                he'd come after you...?

                from Dr. Lechter's cell, drawings he 
                made, his books.

                contributed to many instances of his 
                abuse." 

     SOUND OF A "WHOOSH," AS A DOOR OPENS, CORDELL CLOSES THE
     FOLDER.  HE LOOKS TOWARD THE DOOR. 

     ANGLE 

     IN THE BED, VERGER, HIS FACE OBSCURED BY A TELEVISION
     MONITOR.  WE HEAR THE WHIR OF A TV CAMERA. 

     WE SEE THE CAMERA, ABOVE VERGER'S BED, MOVING.

     ANGLE 

     ON A TV SCREEN, WE SEE THE CAMERA TRACK, AND TAKE THE
     FRIGHTENED FRANKLIN, AND THE NURSE STANDING NEXT TO HIM,
     THE NURSE MOTIONS FRANKLIN FORWARD. 

     ANGLE, ON CORDELL, LOOKING DOWN AT VERGER.  (NB THROUGHOUT,
     VERGER SHOULD NEVER BE SEEN.  HE IS INFERRED THROUGH THE
     REACTIONS OF THOSE AROUND HIM.  AND HE, AND IN PARTICULAR, 
     HIS FACE SHOULD ALWAYS BE OBSCURED--A TEASE--BY THIS OR THAT
     INTERVENING OBJECT.) 

     CORDELL NODS, AS IF IN RESPONSE TO A SIGN FROM VERGER.  HE
     LAYS THE HOSPITAL FOLDER ON A SORT OF XEROX MACHINE. 

     ANGLE ON VERGER'S ELECTRONIC DISPLAY.  THE VARIOUS TV
     SCREENS, THE HOSPITAL FOLDER, NOW COMING INTO VIEW ON A
     SCREEN ON WHICH WE READ THE LOGO OF THE BALTIMORE CHILD
     WELFARE, AND "JAMES, FRANKLIN, BORN JUNE 5, 1991," AND A 
     PHOTO OF HIM.  ON THE ADJACENT SCREEN WE SEE THE YOUNG BOY
     COMING FORWARD AT THE URGING OF HIS NURSE.  HIS EYES
     GROWING WIDE WITH FEAR.

     ANGLE 

     FROM BEHIND FRANKLIN, AS HIS BODY OBSCURES OUR VIEW OF 
     VERGER, AND WE HEAR THE ELECTRONICALLY ENHANCED VOICE OF
     VERGER CONVERSING WITH HIM. 

                          VERGER
                Are you Franklin ? 

                          FRANKLIN
                ...Franklin. 

                          VERGER 
                Where do you live? 

                          FRANKLIN 
                With Mama and Shirley and Stringbean. 

     ANGLE SHIFT TO OVER VERGER, ONTO THE FRIGHTENED BOY.  IN THE
     BG WE SEE THE NURSE BEATING A STRATEGIC RETREAT TO THE DOOR,
     AND AFTER HER EXIT, WE SEE HER APPEAR ON THE SCREEN WHICH
     SHOWS THE CORRIDOR, TAKING A CHAIR ACROSS FROM "ROSIE," WE
     SEE HER SIT AND TAKE OUT A BOOK AND READ.  AS VERGER TALKS
     WITH FRANKLIN, WE SEE THE INFORMATION ON THE "TEXT" SCREEN
     SCROLL, WHICH NEW INFO WE SEE REFLECTED IN VERGER'S
     QUESTIONS. 

                          FRANKLIN (cont'd) 
                But Stringbean, he in and out.

                          VERGER 
                In and out.  Yes.  And Mama... and Mama,
                is not your real Mama, is she Franklin? 

                          FRANKLIN
                She my foster. 

                          VERGER 
                She's not the first foster that you've
                had.  Is she? 

                          FRANKLIN
                No. 
                    (THE CHILD LOOKS AROUND, AND,
                     FINDING NO SUPPORT, LOOKS
                     BACK AT VERGER.) 

                          VERGER 
                Do you like it at your home, Franklin? 

                          FRANKLIN
                    (FRIGHTENING) 
                We got KittyKat... 

                          VERGER
                Yes.... yes... 

                          FRANKLIN 
                ...and Shirly, let me sleep with her
                sometime. 

                          VERGER 
                Yes.  Franklin, you can't live there
                anymore.  With Mama and Shirly and
                Kittykat.  You have to go away. 

                          FRANKLIN
                ...who say...? 

                          VERGER 
                The government says.  Mama has lost her
                job, so she can't be your foster 
                mother.  The police found a marijuana 
                cigarette in your home.  You can't see
                Mama anymore.  Or Shirley.  Or Kitty 
                Cat.  That's what the Government says... 

     ANGLE XCU ON FRANKLIN. 

                          VERGER (cont'd) 
                ...or perhaps they just don't want you
                anymore.  Could that be?  And, do you 
                know what will happen to Kitty Cat?  When
                you go away.  The police will take her,
                and they'll give her a shot.  With a 
                shiny needle.  They'll give Kitty Cat a
                shot.  And it will hurt her.  And then
                she will die. 

     FRANKLIN TAKES THE TAIL OF HIS SHIRT FROM HIS PANTS AND
     HOLDS IT TO HIS EYES. 

     ANGLE 

     ON VERGER'S BED, AND ON CORDELL BEHIND HIM, GLANCING THROUGH
     A FILE. 

     CORDELL LOOKS UP AT THE WAILING OF FRANKLIN. 

                          VERGER (cont'd)
                Come here...
                    (BEAT.
                     FRANKLIN COMES FORWARD, HIS 
                     FACE SCREWING UP IN TERROR AS 
                     THE DETAIL OF VERGER BECOME
                     MORE APPARENT.  HE STOPS
                     MOVING FORWARD.) 
                Do you know how you keep kittycat from
                getting a shot?  Franklin?  No?  Do you
                know.  Then come here... 

     FRANKLIN COMES FORWARD.

                          VERGER (cont'd) 
                You can keep Kitty Cat from
                getting a shot if... 

     ANGLE 

     ON CORDELL, WHO REACTS TO SOME SIGN FROM VERGER, AND NODS,
     AND TAKES A SMALL PACKAGE FROM A POCKET IN HIS COAT.

     ANGLE 

     ON CORDELL, WHO GIVES THE PACKAGE TO FRANKLIN.

                          VERGER (cont'd) 
                If you give him this... 

     ANGLE ON FRANKLIN, AS HE LOOKS DOWN AT THE PACKAGE IN HIS
     HANDS. 

     ANGLE INS: 

     IT IS A PACKAGE OF RAT POISON.

     ANGLE 

     ON FRANKLIN, HOLDING THE POISON, HE LOOKS UP AS VERGER 
     TALKS. 

                          VERGER (cont'd) 
                You can keep her from getting the shot,
                if you give her that rat poison
                yourself... 

     ANGLE, HOLD ON FRANKLIN, WHO BEGINS TO WEEP COPIOUSLY. 

     ANGLE, ON THE VIDEO SCREEN SHOWING FRANKLIN, AS WE HEAR A
     SERVO MOTOR, AND THE SCREEN ZOOMS IN TO SHOW A TEAR. 

     ANGLE 

     ON CORDELL, WHO IS NOW AT A SMALL WETBAR, MIXING VODKA AND
     VERMOUTH AND POURING THEM INTO A MARTINI SHAKER. 

     HE GLANCES OVER, AND NODS. 

     ANGLE 

     ON CORDELL, AS HE PUSHES A BUTTON ON A CONSOLE.  ON THE
     SCREEN OVER VERGER'S BED WE SEE THE NURSE IN THE HALL
     REACT.  SHE PUTS HER PAPERBACK BOOK INTO HER POCKET, AND
     RISES, AND WE SEE HER ENTER VERGER'S ROOM, AND STAND BY
     THE DOOR. 

                          VERGER (cont'd) 
                Goodbye, Franklin. 

     CORDELL WALKS FRANKLIN TO THE DOOR.

                          VERGER (cont'd) 
                ...remember what we talked about.

     WE HEAR VERGER'S ELECTRONICALLY AMPLIFIED BREATHING BECOME
     EXCITED, AND ON THE LIFESIGNS SCREENS, WE SEE HIS VITAL
     SIGNS BECOME MORE AGITATED, AND THE NURSE, AND CORDELL
     START TOWARD THE BED. 

                          VERGER (cont'd) 
                    (AS HIS BREATHING QUIETS)
                No, I'm fine... 

     WE SEE CORDELL START BACK INTO THE ROOM, AND THEN, AT THE
     SOUND OF VERGER'S VOICE TURN AWAY AGAIN. 

     ANGLE, AT THE DOOR, CORDELL SIGNS TO THE NURSE, AND
     STOOPS TO THE CRYING FRANKLIN. 

     CORDELL TAKES A STERILE PLASTIC BAG FROM HIS POCKET, HE
     REMOVES FROM IT A CLAMP, IN THE JAWS OF WHICH ARE A SMALL
     SQUARE OF COTTON GAUZE.  HE STOOPS TO FRANKLIN, AND
     CAREFULLY TAKES ONE OF FRANKLIN'S TEARS ONTO THE GAUZE.  HE
     NODS TO THE NURSE, WHO EXITS WITH FRANKLIN. 

     HE DISAPPEARS FROM THE SHOT.

     ANGLE ON VERGER.

                          VERGER (cont'd) 
                ..what have we heard from our friend at
                the FBI...? 

     ANGLE ON CORDELL, AS HE TAKES AN ENVELOPE, AND EXTRACTS A
     XEROX OF AN X-RAY AND PUTS IT ON THE SCREEN, WE SEE IT IS
     THE "BRAZILIAN" X-RAY OF LECHTER'S HAND.  WE SEE AN IMPRINT
     AT THE TOP OF THE X-RAY--THE PATIENTS NAME AND THE LAB
     NAME RIPPED AWAY--ALL THAT REMAINS ARE THE WORDS "...DO
     BRAZIL." 

                          CORDELL 
                Most current information shows the 
                result of an operation for the removal 
                of a sixth digit, the left hand of a man. 

                          VERGER 
                Can we identify it as Dr. Lechter? 

                          CORDELL 
                Not with any certainty we... 

     VERGER'S BREATHING AGAIN BECOMES EXCITABLE.

                          VERGER 
                Why did he come back?

                           CORDELL 
                Our operatives in Brazil have been
                empowered to offer a reward of....

                          VERGER 
                ...WHY DID HE COME BACK?  WHY DID THE BOY
                TURN BACK...? 

                          CORDELL
                ...are you alright, sir...? 

                          VERGER 
                HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM.  Where have
                we Seen it Before. 

                          CORDELL
                Seen what, sir..? 

                          VERGER 
                The puppy comes back.  If you lie on the
                ground.  The Puppy with return.  Why?
                Do you know why...?  TO KILL YOU.  IT 
                THINKS YOU HAVE FALLEN AND ARE POWERLESS.
                IT COMES BACK TO TEAR YOUR THROAT. 
                THAT'S WHY THE CHILD TURNED BACK.  As
                Lechter will return back.  You see?  To
                the sight of his oppressor wounded.
                He will return to savage our beloved Miss
                Starling.  Bring me a drink. 

     CORDELL TURNS, BACK TO THE CONSOLE.

     WE SEE CORDELL TURN, AND APPROACH THE BED, HOLDING THE
     MARTINI ON A TRAY. 

     HE PUTS THE TRAY DOWN ON THE BEDTABLE.

     ANGLE INS. 

     WE SEE, ON THE SMALL METAL HOSPITAL TRAY, THE MARTINI SHAKER, 
     THE MARTINI GLASS, AND A SMALL BEAKER, IN WHICH IS THE CLAMP
     WHICH BEARS THE GAUZE PAD WHICH BEARS FRANKLIN'S TEARS.

     CORDELL SHAKES THE SHAKER, POURS IT INTO THE GLASS, AND
     DROPS THE GAUZE PAD INTO IT, AND HANDS IT TO VERGER. 

                          CORDELL
                Your drink, sir. 

                          VERGER 
                It's time to step up the pressure on
                our Sweet Miss Starling.  ...call our 
                friend at the F.B.I.  And, instead of 
                finding Lechter, let's help Him find us. 

     ANGLE 

     ON ONE OF THE VIDEO SCREENS, WE SEE A SHEET LABELLED
     "CONFIDENTIAL FBI NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION."  AND WE SEE, IN 
     VARIOUS SQUARES BELOW, THE DRAWINGS BY LECHTER, THE VARIOUS
     FUNERAY SKETCHES. 

     CAMERA COMES IN ON ONE OF THE MIDDLE, LEFT, WHICH SHOWS THE
     LION WITH A BIRD IN ITS MOUTH. 

     EXT FLORENCE PARK NIGHT. 

     THE STATUE OF THE LION HOLDING THE BIRD.  A COUPLE WALKING
     PAST. 

                          PAZZI 
                ...the purpose of the exercise... is it
                because they are expensive... 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                They aren't expensive, you got them
                through your connections.... speaking of
                which: 

                          PAZZI 
                Fine, thank you, but 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                Speaking of which, I want you also to
                get us tickets for the Opera... 

                          PAZZI 
                ...whatever is within my power... 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                ...and that is what you need to expand. 

                          PAZZI 
                I don't understand. 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                    (SHE STOPS AND ADDRESSES HIM) 
                We are here on sufferance.  I am here... 

                          PAZZI 
                ...why are we here in the first place...? 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                Because it is exclusive... because
                everyone will be here... 

     CAMERA TAKES THEM PAST A SIGN ANNOUNCING "EXHIBITION
     INSTRUMENTS OF ATROCIOUS TORTURE," AND A VELVET ROPE, AND
     VARIOUS WELL DRESSED PEOPLE WAITING TO GET IN. 

     PAZZI WALKS TO THE HEAD OF THE LINE, AND SHOWS HIS TICKETS,
     AND IS ADMITTED. 

     ANGLE INT.  THE EXHIBIT HALL. 

     AN IRON MAIDEN.  A COFFIN SHOWING SPIKES ON ONE SIDE, THE
     OTHER SIDE EMPTY, IS AN IMPROVISED ENTRY TO THE EXHIBIT. 
     PAZZI AND HIS WIFE ENTER, SHE STOPS TO GOSSIP WITH A WELL
     DRESSED COUPLE. 

                          MRS. PAZZI (cont'd) 
                Mrs. Demetrio, how good to see you... 

     ANGLE ON PAZZI, AS HE DRIFTS AWAY.  WE SEE HIM STARING AT
     VARIOUS THUMBSCREWS, A RACK, A GUILLOTINE.  HE STOOPS TO READ
     A PLACARD.  HIS WIFE COMES UP BEHIND HIM. 

                          MRS. PAZZI (cont'd)
                You see, that is my point. 

                          PAZZI
                ...my love... 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                ...they asked us to dinner.  How can we
                accept if we cannot return the... 

                          PAZZI 
                I am on the track of... 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                Yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand 
                dollars reward, which you would have to
                split with your team, which, if you get
                it, will not buy me a new watch...
                    (SHE STOPS TO GREET ANOTHER COUPLE) 

                          PAZZI 
                ...what do you expect me to... 

     HE STOPS, AND TURNS AWAY, WHEN HE SEES THAT SHE IS 
     ENGROSSED.  HE IS NOW LOOKING AT A TORTURE WHEEL.  HE 
     STOPS AND LOOKS INTENTLY INTO THE GLOOM OF THE ROPED OFF
     EXHIBIT. 

     ANGLE HIS POV 

     INSIDE THE EXHIBIT, IN A DARK CORNER, THE FIGURE OF A MAN.
     SKETCHING. 

     ANGLE XCU ON FELL, LECHTER, IN THE GLOOM, SKETCHING. 

     WE SEE A GOOD SKETCH OF THE WHEEL, ON WHICH HE HAS ADDED
     ARCHITECTURAL NOTES ON ANGLES AND DISTANCES.  HE TURNS,
     FEELING SOMEONE LOOKING AT HIM. 

     ANGLE HIS POV. 

     PAZZI, BEYOND THE VELVET ROPE.  PEERING INTENTLY, RETURNING
     FELL'S GLANCE. 

     DOUBLECUTTING:  WE RETURN TO PAZZI, STARING, WE SEE HIM MAKE
     A QUICK ADDENDUM TO THE SKETCH OF THE TORTURE WHEEL.  AND
     THEN RETURN TO PAZZI, LEANING OVER TO PEER MORE CLOSELY
     INTO THE GLOOM. 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                So, the question:  as always, Rinaldo,
                the question is one of mmm... 

     ANGLE 

     ON MRS. PAZZI, AS FELL APPEARS AT THEIR SIDE, SHE TURNS TO
     HIM. 

                          FELL
                Commendatore would you do me the honor of
                introducing me. 

                          PAZZI 
                Darling, Dr. Fell.  My wife Madame Pazzi. 

                          FELL 
                    (HE BENDS TO KISS HER HAND)
                Enchante. 

                          GUIDE
                The exhibit is closing.  The exhibit is
                closing in Ten Minutes... please make
                your way to the... 

                          MRS. PAZZI
                Dr. Fell.  You are not Italian. 

                          FELL 
                Sadly, no.  And I find that birth is one
                of the few things in life which study
                and a pleasant attitude can not amend.
                What do you think? 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                And how do we account for the interest

                Indeed I am.  And the connection, 
                between Dante, and, in fact, between 
                your illustrious forebears... if you'd
                come with me, I could show you...

                How unfortunate. 

     PAZZI STARTS TO HELP HIS WIFE ON WITH HER WRAP.

                          FELL (cont'd)
                May I...? 

     HE TAKES THE WRAP, AND BEGINS TO DRAPE IT AROUND HER
     SHOULDERS.

                          MRS. PAZZI
                Then we cannot go. 

                          PAZZI

     FRONT OF HIM.  HE RESUMES PLAYING. 

     ANGLE HIS POV 

     THE MUSIC STAND.  IT HOLDS NOT MUSIC, BUT THE SKETCH WE SAW
     HIM DO EARLIER OF STARLING.  WE SEE HIS HAND ADJUST THE PAGES
     ONCE AGAIN, AND THE SKETCH OF STARLING IS HALF-OBSCURED BY
     THE SKETCH WE SAW FELL MAKE OF THE TORTURE WHEEL.  AT THE
     TOP OF THE SKETCH WE SEE THE ADDED FACES OF PAZZI AND MME
     PAZZI, SKETCHED BY FELL AT THE EXHIBIT. 

     ANGLE 

     FRONTAL ON FELL, AS HE STOPS PLAYING.  HE PICKS UP A GLASS OF
     WINE WHICH HAS BEEN RESTING ON THE CLAVIER, AND TAKES ONE OF
     THE SKETCHES AND GAZES INTENTLY AT IT. 

     HE SHIVERS SLIGHTLY, AND TURNS UP THE COLLAR OF HIS
     JACKET. 

     ANGLE, AS HIS POV.

     BEARDED SOLDIERS, COOKING OVER A SMALL FIRE MADE ON THE
     FLOOR OF THE DISHEVELLED HOME.

     OF A SMALL FACTORY BUILDING. 

     INT DARK FACTORY BUILDING NIGHT. 

     STARLING IS MOVING THROUGH THE BUILDING, AGAINST THE WALL,
     HUGGING THE WALL.  SHE HEARS A SOUND, AND TURNS.  SHE LOOKS 
     DOWN. 

     ANGLE HER POV--A SMALL BADGE WITH A BULLETHOLE IN IT, LYING
     ON THE FLOOR.  SHE LOOKS UP TO THE SOUND OF RUNNING, AND SEES 
     A FIGURE FLITTING ACROSS AN OPENING. 

     ANGLE 

     STARLING RAISES HER PISTOL AND PULLS THE TRIGGER. 

     NOTHING HAPPENS.  SHE LOOKS AT THE PISTOL.  IT IS JAMMED, SHE 
     TRIES TO CLEAR IT QUICKLY, WE SEE A HAND ON HER SHOULDER, SHE
     TURNS. 

     ANGLE HER POV 

     IT IS THE FACE OF LECHTER. 

     STARLING RAISES THE PISTOL AND FIRES.  WE SEE THE PISTOL 
     EXPLODE. 

     WE HEAR SCREAMING. 

     ANGLE INT STARLING'S BEDROOM.  STARLING, SITTING UP IN BED, 
     SCREAMING.  MAPP BURST IN TO THE ROOM.  FOLLOWED BY HER
     BOYFRIEND, JIM, WHO CARRIES A GUN, AND SWEEPS THE ROOM.  MAPP
     SITS BY STARLING.

     CORDELL COMES AND STANDS BY THE BED.  HE PICKS UP A 
     TELEPHONE, AND TOUCHES SOME BUTTONS ON THE CONSOLE.  WE SEE
     ONE OF THE VIDEO SCREENS COME TO LIFE, AND WE SEE A BARN,
     AND A COUPLE OF RATTY LOOKING GENTLEMEN WITH COFFEECUPS. 

                          VERGER (cont'd)
                Good morning, Gentlemen.

                come on the whistle, and to attack the
                figurine. 

     WE SEE THE OTHER GENTLEMEN BRING FORWARD A SCARECROW.

     THE GENTLEMAN BLOWS HIS WHISTLE.  THE PIGS RUN AT THE
     FIGURINE AND STOP.  WE HEAR THE SOUND OF HUMAN SCREAMS. 

                          GENTLEMAN

                We don't want the man consumed.  No.  We
                want to put the man's feet through the 
                bars, and have the pigs... and have the
                pigs eat his feet.

                Well, I don't want to starve them too

                Oh, no, no.  It won't be that long. 

     THE CAMERA ZOOMS IN ON THE PIGS.  IN AN UPPER SCREEN WE SEE 
     A CHICKEN WANDERING OUTSIDE THE PEN.  THE CHICKEN WANDERS
     INTO THE PEN.  ON THE FIRST SCREEN WE SEE ONE OF THE PIGS

                          PSYCHIATRIST 
                You said:  that you have "decided."
                That your... your feelings of 
                persecution, as you put it are a "self-
                indulgence," and you are going to put 
                them aside.  And get on with your job.

     STARLING'S EYES GROW VERY WIDE.

     ANGLE HER POV. 

     EVELDA HAS PRODUCED A SMALL SMG FROM BEHIND HER BABYSLING, 
     AND IS SPRAYING THE STREET. 

     ANGLE, ON STARLING, AS SHE LOOKS AROUND.  BRIGHAM FALL, HIT,
     BY HER SIDE.  AND SEVERAL OTHER SWAT MEMBERS BEGIN RUNNING
     FOR COVER.  THE MAN WITH THE RAINCOAT DROPS IT, TO REVEAL A
     SAWED OFF SHOTGUN.  HE FIRES AT STARLING.  SHE GOES DOWN IN
     THE STREET. 

     ANGLE ON STARLING IN THE STREET.

     AS SHE PICKS HERSELF UP FROM THE PAVEMENT, AND CRAWLS TOWARD
     THE SAFETY OF A PARKED CAR.

     A CADILLAC SEDAN IS COMING DOWN THE STREET, THE SAME APACHE
     STYLE SHOOTER WE SAW PREVIOUSLY IS SHOOTING OVER THE ROOF,
     AT THE POLICE.  THE CAR SCREECHES INTO A FISHTAIL, AND
     EVELDA, STILL SHOOTING, GET INTO THE BACKSEAT.  THE CAR BURNS
     RUBBER, TRYING TO ACCELERATE.

     STARLING EMERGES FROM HER COVER AND FIRES AT THE CAR.  THE
     WINDSHIELD SPATTERS, AND A TIRE BLOWS OUT.  THE CAR CRASHES
     INTO A FISH STALL. 

     SOUND OF A HELICOPTER.

     TWO SHOOTERS TRY TO SLITHER OUT OF THE CRUSHED CAR.
     STARLING, ADVANCING TOWARD THEM, SHOOTS THEM BOTH. 

     ANGLE, HER POV.

     EVELDA, AND THE BABY, IN THE BACKSEAT.  THE BABY CRYING.

     STARLING ADVANCES ON THEM.

                    (TO THE COPS) 
                SECURITY SECURITY!  WATCH THE FISH HOUSE
                DOOR BEHIND ME.  GET MY BACK.  Evelda.
                Evelda.  Put your hands out of the
                window. 

     ANGLE 

     ON BRIGHAM, ON THE GROUND.  TWITCHING.  HE IS SHAKING HIS
     HEAD, DAZED. 

                          STARLING (cont'd) 
                Evelda.  Show me your hands.  Come on.
                Please.  Show me your hands. 

     ANGLE, ON EVELDA. 

                          EVELDA 
                Well, it's you, chile.  It's my friend
                the orphan... 

                          STARLING 
                Give it up, Evelda.

                          EVELDA 
                You said you din' have no friends--but
                I'm your friend--  I understand you....

                          STARLING 
                Think about the baby... show me your 
                hands.... Evelda?  Show me your hands... 

                          EVELDA
                F'that's the thing to do... 

     SHE WITHDRAWS A HAND FROM THE BABYSLING, SHOWING A SMALL
     PISTOL, WHICH SHE LEVELS AT STARLING. 

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING AS SHE FIRES AT EVELDA.  SHE RUNS FORWARD, AND
     TAKES THE SCREAMING BABY FROM EVELDA'S ARMS.  THE BABY IS
     COVERED IN BLOOD. 

     STARLING RUNS TO THE STILL RUNNING HOSE WHICH THE FISH
     WORKER DROPPED, AND SLUICES DOWN THE BABY. 

     SOUND OF HELICOPTER.

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE LOOKS UP.

     ANGLE HER POV.

     THE HELICOPTER SHOWS A CAMERAMAN HANGING OUT OF THE DOOR ON
     A SLING, AND THE LOGO WCTU, TV 10.

     ANGLE 

     A TELEVISION SCREEN, SHOWING THE SHOT FROM THE HELICOPTER.
     SCREEN BEARS THE SMALL LOGO, SUPERED IN THE LOWER RIGHT
     CORNER:

     TV 10, NEWS LIVE.

     WE SEE, FROM ABOVE, STARLING, HOSING DOWN THE BABY, AND
     WALKING INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET.  WE HEAR THE SOUND OF
     AN AMBULANCE, AND THE HELO SHOT SHIFTS TO AN AMBULANCE
     SCREAMING AROUND THE CORNER. 

     ANGLE 

     BACK ON THE STREET.  STARLING, HOLDING THE BABY, IS WALKING
     THROUGH THE SCENE OF THE CARNAGE.  SHE SEES BRIGHAM, RAISING 
     HIMSELF TO AN ELBOW, AND HE MOUTHS, "I'M ALRIGHT..."

     STARLING WALKS ON, PAST THE CAR, WITH THE DEAD BODIES. 
     PARAMEDICS COME OUT OF THE STOPPED AMBULANCE, AND ONE OF THEM
     TAKES THE INFANT FROM THE DAZED STARLING.

     STARLING HELPS BRIGHAM TO HIS FEET.  HE STANDS WOOZILY, HE
     BEGINS TO UNBUCKLE THE KEVLAR PROTECTIVE VEST HE WEARS. 

                          BRIGHAM
                I... 

                          STARLING 
                What, What, I can't hear you... 

                          BRIGHAM 
                Are you alright...? 

     THEY ARE SCREAMING OVER THE SOUND OF THE HELICOPTER. 

                          STARLING 
                I almost shot the baby... 

                          BRIGHAM
                Who called the TV CREWS...? 

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET.  BRIGHAM
     CALLS ANOTHER COP OVER. 

                          BRIGHAM (cont'd)
                Sergeant...

     AN OFFICER, FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER, COMES UP TO BRIGHAM.  THE
     THREE ADVANCE TOWARD THE SCENE AT THE PARKED CAR. 

     STARLING TURNS TOWARD THEM.

                          STARLING
                Security!!! 

     WE SEE THE SECOND OFFICER PICK UP THE SHOTGUN FROM THE ARMS
     OF THE "RAINCOAT" MAN. 

                          BRIGHAM 
                    (TURNING BACK, TO RESPOND TO
                     STARLING, HE DRAWS HIS HAND
                     ACROSS HIS THROAT) 
                They're dead... standdown, it's alr... 

     ANGLE 

     ON THE OFFICER PICKING UP THE SHOTGUN.  IT DISCHARGES.

     ANGLE ON BRIGHAM, AS HE FALLS, FELLED BY THE SHOTGUN BLAST. 

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE TURNS, TO LOOK AT THE SCENE, OF THE DYING 
     BRIGHAM. 

     SHE STARTS TO TAKE A STEP TOWARD HIM, AND STOPS.

     SHE LOOKS UP AT THE HELICOPTER.

     ANGLE

     THE TV IMAGE, WITH THE LOGO ON IT, WE SEE IT ZOOM IN ON 
     STARLING LOOKING UP, SHE THEN WALKS, DAZEDLY, TOWARD THE
     OBVIOUSLY DEAD BRIGMAN, AND SITS, SEVERAL FEET FROM HIM.  WE
     SEE SEVERAL OFFICERS COMING FORWARD TOWARD HER.

     THE BACK OF THE DESK CHAIR, HOLDS A MAN'S SPORTCOAT, AND A
     TIE. 

     FELL MOVES TOWARD THE CHAIR, PUTS HIS CLEAVER DOWN ON THE
     DESK, AND TRIES THE TIE BETWEEN HIS HANDS, TESTING HIS
     STRENGTH. 

     HE NODS, SATISFIED, AND PICKS UP THE CLEANER.

     ANGLE INS 

     THE CLEANER, WHICH IS LAYING ON TOP OF THE FILE REGARDING THE 
     DISAPPEARANCE OF DOTTORE FANELLI, BENEATH IT, HALF COVERED,
     IS THE FBI LOGO. 

     WE SEE FELL'S HAND RAISE THE FIRST FILE, TO LOOK AT THE
     SECOND, AND WE READ: "FBI REPORT, THE PSYCHOPATHOLOGY, ETC,
     OF HANNIBAL LECHTER." 

     ANGLE CU.

     ON FELL, AS HE NODS TO HIMSELF, HE THEN LOOKS DOWN AT
     SOMETHING ELSE. 

     ANGLE HIS POV. 

     A SCARF, PEEPING OUT OF THE HALF-OPEN DESK DRAWER.

     ANGLE INS. 

     FELL'S HAND DRAWS OUT THE SCARF.  NESTLED IN THE SCARF IS 
     THE PHOTO OF PAZZI IN FRONT OF THE WANTED POSTER. 

     ANGLE ON FELL, AS HE LOOKS AT THE PICTURE.  HE THEN BEGINS TO
     PEER VERY CLOSELY AT IT.  HE PICKS UP THE MAGNIFYING GLASS
     FROM THE DESK, AND WE SEE, IN A HUGE INSERT, THAT HE IS
     MOVING THE MAGNIFYING GLASS TO ATTEMPT TO MAKE OUT THE 
     FIGURE REFLECTED IN THE GLASS COVERING THE WANTED POSTER, ID,
     THE FIGURE OF THE PHOTOGRAPHER, IS STARLING. 

     ANGLE XCU 

     INS THE JUST SEEN OUTLINE OF STARLING, HOLDING THE CAMERA.

     ANGLE 

     FELL, LOOKING AT THE PHOTO.  HE THEN GLANCES AT THE SCARF, 
     PICKS IS UP, AND, QUESTIONINGLY, SNIFFS IT ONCE, AND THEN
     AGAIN.  HE HOLDS THE SCARF TO HIS FACE.  HE RUBS IT
     BETWEEN HIS HANDS, AND SMELLS HIS HANDS. 

     ANGLE PAZZI BEDROOM. 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                ...and then, we're going to Greece... 

                          PAZZI 
                Yes, but the important thing, as I've 
                said... 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                ...get me a cigarette. 

     PAZZI GETS UP FROM THE BED, AND WRAPS HIMSELF IN A SHEET,
     AND PROCEEDS INTO THE STUDY. 

                          PAZZI 
                The essential thing.  The essential 
                thing, is that we must be absolutely
                quiet about... 

     HE PULLS OPEN THE DESK DRAWER, AND TAKES OUT A PACK OF
     CIGARETTES. 

     HE LOOKS WONDERINGLY, AT THE DRAWER, BEAT.  HE SHRUGS, HE
     IS ABOUT TO START BACK INTO THE BEDROOM, HE GLANCES AT THE
     CURTAINS, BLOWING IN THE OPEN WINDOW, HESITATES.

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                ...what is it? 

     HE LOOKS INTO THE DESK, SHAKES HIS HEAD.  BEAT.

     AND THEN RETURNS INTO THE BEDROOM. 

                          MRS. PAZZI (cont'd) 
                ...you've forgotten the cigarettes. 

     PAZZI TURNS, AND LOOKS BACK TOWARD THE OPEN WINDOW, AND THE
     BLOWING SHADES.

     EXT FLORENTINE PARK NIGHT.

     A YOUNG WOMAN WALKS PAST THE CAMERA.  SHE TAKES US TO FELL,
     WHO IS SITTING ACROSS FROM THE STATUE OF THE LION AND THE
     BIRD, HE IS PICKING HIS TEETH, AND, VERY DELICATELY, TAKES 
     OUT A SCARF, AND WIPES HIS MOUTH.  WE SEE IT IS THE SCARF
     WHICH HE STOLE FROM PAZZI, HE TAKES OUT THE PHOTOGRAPH OF 
     THE WANTED POSTER, AND LOOKS AT IT, AS HE WALKS THROUGH THE
     PARK. 

     CAMERA TAKES HIM OUT OF THE PARK, PAST THE YOUNG WOMAN, WHO,
     WE SEE, HAS RETURNED TO A STROLLER, WHICH IS EMPTY, SHE IS
     TALKING TO A UNIFORMED POLICEMAN, AND GESTURING, "ABOUT THIS
     HIGH..."  SHOWING THE HEIGHT OF HER CHILD.  HE AND THE
     WOMAN START LOOKING IN THE BUSHES.

     ANGLE 

     ON FELL, LEAVING THE PARK, HE WALKS PAST AN APPLIANCE STORE, 
     IN THE WINDOW OF WHICH WE SEE, TEN SILENT TV SCREENS, AND A
     TALKING HEAD ANNOUNCER.

     THE SCENE SHIFTS TO THE HELICOPTER FOOTAGE OF STARLING.

     WE SEE PHOTOS DISPLAYED OF STARLING, NEXT TO THE PEOPLE SHE
     SHOT IN THE SHOOTOUT, AND A VISBO PROCLAIMS, "KILLER OF
     FIVE, THE DEATH ANGEL: CLARICE STARLING." 

     EXT STARLING'S HOUSE, DAY. 

     STARLING, MAPP, AND JIM, MAPP'S BOYFRIEND, ARE COMING OUT OF
     THE HOUSE WITH CRAWFORD, ESCORTED TOWARD SEVERAL CARS OF
     WHAT IS OBVIOUSLY A FUNERAL CORTEGE. 

     A SEDAN PULLS UP, AND KRENDLER GETS OUT.

                          KRENDLER
                I came to pay my...

     SHE STARTS PUSHING HIM, AND CAMERA PANS, TO A GROUP OF
     NEWSVANS, CORDONED OFF, AROUND THE CORNER, AND HELD IN BAY 
     BY VARIOUS POLICE.  STARLING IS BEING SUBDUED BY CRAWFORD
     ET AL.

                Loves you? 

     ANGLE.  ON STARLING, STANDING BY THE LINE OF CARS.  SHE
     SEES SOMETHING, AND TURNS. 

     ANGLE XCU STARLING AS SHE LOOKS.  KRENDLER CONTINUES HIS
     HARANGUE.

     THE SEDAN DRIVES OFF, AS SHE STRAINS TO LOOK AFTER IT.

                          KRENDLER (cont'd) 
                Well, here I am, you... 

     STARLING SHAKES HER HEAD AGAIN, FINDS HERSELF FACING 
     KRENDLER, AND PUNCHES HIM IN THE STOMACH.  KRENDLER GOES 
     DOWN.  STARLING IS SUBDUED BY HER COMFORTERS.  SHE STRAINS 
     TO LOOK AFTER THE DEPARTING CAR.

     INT VERGER'S ROOM. 

     ON THE TV STARLING, BEING PULLED OFF OF KRENDLER.

     PAZZI, WALKING DOWN THE STREET.  NERVOUSLY ADJUSTS HIS SCARF.

     ANGLE 

     A BRIGAND, LOUNGING BY A VAN, NODS IMPERCEPTIBLY, AT PAZZI, 
     WHO CONTINUES WALKING.

     THE BRIGAND GOES INTO THE BACK OF THE VAN.

     ANGLE INT THE VAN. 

     THERE IS ANOTHER BRIGAND INSIDE.  THERE ARE SEVERAL FIREARMS 
     IN A RACK, AND A HOSPITAL GURNEY WITH HEAVY RESTRAINTS.  THE
     SECOND BRIGAND IS LOADING AN ODD LOOKING SHOULDER WEAPON. 

                          SECOND BRIGAND 
                I hit him with the beanbag gun, you stand
                by:  he's still flopping... 

     THE FIRST BRIGAND NODS, AND TAKES A CAPPED HYPODERMIC
     SYRINGE FROM THE SECOND MAN.

                          SECOND BRIGAND (cont'd) 
                Just make sure he's alive, because I've
                already spent the bonus... 

     THE FRUIT MAN NODS TO THE SECOND, AND WE SEE PAZZI
     PROCEEDING UP THE STAIRS INTO THE PALAZZO.

     INT A SALON AT THE PALAZZO, NIGHT.

     A WORKER IS MOVING A FLOOR POLISHER ACROSS THE MARBLE FLOOR 
     OF THE SALON, IN AN ANTEROOM BEYOND WE HEAR FELL LECTURING.
     THE WORKER NODS DIFFERENTIALLY, AT SOMEONE OFF SCREEN. 

     WE SEE HE HAS NODDED AT PAZZI, WHO TAKES US TO THE DOOR OF
     THE SALON.

     HE WIPES HIS HANDS NERVOUSLY, HE MOPS HIS BROW, HE LOOKS AT
     HIS WATCH. 

     HE LOOKS INTO THE SALON.

     ANGLE HIS POV 

     FELL, IN FRONT OF A LECTERN.  A SLIDE MACHINE IS SHOWING A 
     PAINTING OF A HANGED FIGURE ON A HUGE DRIPCLOTH AT THE BACK
     OF THE SALON.

     ANGLE, ON PAZZI, AS HE MOVES TO THE SIDE, IE, OUT OF THE
     DOORWAY TO THE SALON, HE GLANCES OVER HIS SHOULDER, TO MAKE
     SURE HE IS OUT OF THE SIGHT OF THE WORKMAN WITH THE FLOOR
     POLISHER.  HE SEES THE WORKMAN TURN THE POLISHER OFF AND 
     BEGIN COILING THE LONG ELECTRIC CORD.  PAZZI TAKES A SMALL
     FLAT AUTOMATIC FROM A HIP HOLSTER.  CHECKS THE CHAMBER, AND
     SLIPS IT INTO HIS JACKET POCKET.  HE PROCEEDS BACK TO THE
     DOORWAY, WHERE WE AND HE SEE FELL, BEYOND, LECTURING TO A
     COMPANY OF SIX MEN, IN THE SALON. 

                          FELL

                Della vigna was disgraced and blinded 
                for his betrayal of his emperor's trust-
                -through avarice.  Avarice and hanging
                    (HE GESTURES TO THE PAINTING)
                are linked in the ancient and the
                madeadeval mind. 

     ANGLE ON PAZZI, AS HANNIBAL (FELL) SPEAKS, HE MOVES TO A
     WINDOW, AND WIPES HIS HAND AGAIN, AND WE SEE HIM LOOK DOWN
     AT THE VAN IN THE STREET, AND WIPE HIS HANDS, MUCH OF THIS
     SPEECH PLAYS AS VOICE-OVER AS HE DOES SO. 

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                Judas and Pier Della Vigna are linked in
                Dante by the avarice he saw in them, and
                their subsequent deaths by hanging.  Ah
                Commendatore Pazzi... 

     ANGLE ON FELL, AS HE SPEAKS TO PAZZI, HALF-SEEN IN THE DOORWAY. 

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                You are welcome.  Since you are closest
                to the door, would you close the door, to
                improve the quality of the image.
                    (PAZZI DOES SO) 
                You will be interested in this,
                Commandatore, as there are two Pazzi's 
                already in Dante's inferno... 

     ANGLE ON FELL, AS HE WALKS FORWARD, BETWEEN THE CHAIRS OF
     THE SIX OLD MEN (THE STUDIOLO) WHO SIT LISTENING TO HIS
     LECTURE.  A FEW TAKE NOTES.

                Camicion de Pazzi, as you know, murdered
                a kinsman, and rests in hell awaiting the
                arrival of a Second Pazzi.  But it's not
                you:  it's Carlino, who will rest 
                forever in hell for the crime of
                Treachery. 

     ANGLE XCU, ON FELL, LOOKING AT PAZZI. 

     ANGLE ON PAZZI, UNDER THE WITHERING STARE.  BEAT.

                    (HE GESTURES TO THE PHOTOGRAPH
                     OF THE PAINTING) 
                On the next occasion, you might like to
                discuss the matter of Chewing.  Chewing
                in Dante:  Count Ugolino, chewing the
                back of the archbishop's head--Satan,
                with his three Faces, chewing Judas,
                Brutus, and Cassius... all three 
                traitors.  Is it not?  Thank you all for
                your kind attention. 

     THE SCHOLARS APPLAUD HIM, TWO STAND, AND TAKE HIM BY THE
     HAND.

     ANGLE ON PAZZI AT THE DOOR.  HE OPENS THE DOOR, AND THE OLD
     MEN OF THE STUDIOLO EXIT, CHATTERING HAPPILY ABOUT THE 
     LECTURE.  FELL COMES OUT, THE LAST OF THE SALON. 

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                Would you say that I've preserved my
                job, Commendatore? 

                          PAZZI 
                I'm not a scholar, Dottore.  But it
                seemed as if they, as if they... 

                          FELL 
                Yes, I think I amused them.  To what do
                I owe...? 

                          PAZZI
                I require... 

                          FELL 
                ...yes, yes, yes... 

     HE FOLLOWS FELL BACK INTO THE ROOM, WHERE FELL BEGINS
     PUTTING AWAY HIS MATERIAL IN THE D1RTY SALON. 

                          FELL (cont'd)

                          FELL 
                Yes, of course, and we'll collect them.
                I won't be a minute... 

     ANGLE ON PAZZI AS HE WALKS UP TOWARD FELL. 

     HE PUTS HIS HAND IN THE JACKET POCKET.

                Ah, no.  I should have shown them this
                one.. 
                    (HE TAKES OUT A SLIDE AND PUTS
                     IT IN THE PROJECTOR)
                This one will interest you:  let me see
                if I can improve the focus... 

     WE SEE THE IMAGE OF A HANGED MAN APPEAR ON THE DROPCLOTH.
     THERE IS A PLAQUE DRAPED AROUND THE NECK OF THE HANGED MAN.

                          FELL (CONT'D)
                Can you make it out, can you make out
                the name on the plaque? 

     FELL WALKS UP TO THE IMAGE DISPLAYED ON THE DROPCLOTH, PAZZI
     WALKS BEHIND HIM.

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                On a related subject Signor Pazzi, I must
                confess to you:  I'm giving serious
                thought to eating your wife. 

     FELL JERKS THE DROP CLOTH DOWN OVER THE TWO OF THEM.

     ANGLE XCU, ON PAZZI'S FACE AS HE SEES THE CLOTH COMING DOWN.

     ANGLE INS

                Yes.  Your Wife.  Laura.  L'Orange, which
                is the topnote of her skin, wouldn't you
                say?  Or do I grow too personal?  but 
                that is what I think of, when I think of
                her.  And how could I but think of her? 
                I haven't had a bit all day.  The kidney
                and the liver would be su1table for a 
                dinner tonight.  But the rest of the meat
                should hang for a week, in these cool 
                conditions.  Wouldn't you say?  Nod once
                for yes. 
                    (PAUSE) 
                If you tell me what I need to know, 
                then it would be convenient for me to 
                leave without my meal.  And Mrs. Pazzi
                will remain unscathed.  I'll out the 
                questions to you, and we'll see:  I 
                saw at the theatre you had betrayed me.
                And, when the police didn't come, it was
                clear you had sold me out.  Was it to
                Mason Verger?  Blink one for yes. 

     ANGLE ON PAZZI.  BEAT.  THEN HE BLINKS ONCE. 

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                Thank you.  And now:  Are his hit men
                waiting outside? 
                    (PAZZI BLINKS ONCE) 
                Was that a single blink?  Yes.  Thank
                you. 

     FELL FINISHES HIS COILING OF THE ROPE, AND WE SEE HE HAS
     FASHIONED A HANGMAN'S NOOSE. 

     FELL TAKES OUT A STILETTO, AND IT OPENS.  HE ADVANCES TOWARD
     PAZZI, WHO TRIES TO RECOIL. 

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                No, no.  I'm going to take the tape off.
                Please do not scream.  Do you think you
                can keep from screaming? 
                    (HE TAKES THE TAPE OFF) 
                ...would it help if I were to cut your
                BOWELS OUT...? 

     WE SEE HIM MAKE A SWIPE AND HEAR PAZZI START TO SCREAM.

     FROM OUTSIDE THE WINDOW OF THE SALON, WE SEE PAZZI, TAPED TO
     THE PODIUM, BEING IMPELLED, SCREAMING, TOWARD THE WINDOW. 

     ANGLE 

     ON THE LIGHTED PIAZZA OF THE PALAZZO, TOURISTS LOOK UP AT THE
     SCREAMING. 

     BEAT.

     ORANGE NOOSE AROUND HIS NECK, AS THE PODIUM TILTS THROUGH
     THE OPEN WINDOW. 

     ANGLE 

     THE TWO BRIGANDS AT THE VAN.  REACTION TO THE SOUND OF THE
     SCREAMING, RUN AROUND THE CORNER.  THEY LOOK UP TO SEE PAZZI,
     STILL TAPES TO THE PODIUM, HANGING BY THE ORANGE CORD.

     ANGLE, ON THE VILLAINS, STANDING UNDERNEATH, AS GOUTS OF
     BLOOD FALL ON THEM.

                          BRIGAND ONE 
                Kill him, and cut him. 

     HE RUNS TO THE FRONT OF THE PALAZZO, HOLDING HIS SHOULDER
     ARM DOWN ALONGSIDE HIS SIDE. 

     HE RUNS PAST THE LOCKED FRONT DOOR, AND TOWARD AN ALLEYWAY. 

     WE HEAR THE SIRENS OF POLICE CARS.  BRIGAND ONE SLOWS HIS
     WALK, AND PROCEEDS INTO THE ALLEYWAY.  HE SEES A SMALL DOOR,
     IN THE SIDE OF THE PALAZZO, AND A LIGHT BEYOND.

     ANGLE INT THE DOOR.

     A SMALL STAIRCASE.  THE BRIGAND ENTERS, HE LOOKS UP. 

     WE HEAR THE SOUND OF RAPIDLY DESCENDING FOOTSTEPS.  THE
     BRIGAND MOUNTS THE STEPS, HOLDING HIS RIFLE BEFORE HIM.  THE
     SOUND OF THE FOOTSTEPS CONTINUES.

     ON THE SECOND FLOOR, THE BRIGAND SHELTERS HIMSELF IN A ROOM,
     OFF THE LANDING.  THE SOUND OF THE DESCENDING FOOTSTEPS
     CONTINUES.

     ANGLE ON THE BRIGAND, HIDING BEHIND THE DOOR.  THEN HE TURNS
     HIS HEAD.

     ANGLE, HIS POV.

     WE ARE IN A LAUNDRY ROOM.

     THE SOUND OF THE FOOTSTEPS IS, IN FACT, A CLOTHESDRYER.  IN
     ITS GLASS DOOR IN THE SIDE, WE SEE A MAN'S SHOE GOING
     AROUND.

     ANGLE THE BRIGAND, AS HE LOOKS, THEN TO THE SIDE.

     ANGLE, HIS POV, IN THE SIDE OF THE ROOM, THE LEGS OF A DEAD
     MAN PROTRUDE FROM A CLOTHES HAMPER, HE WEARS ONLY ONE SHOE.

                minutes, it is the end of marriage.
                    (HE HANDS A BUNDLE OF NOTES
                     TOWARD THE BOY)

     IN THE PIAZZA, THE BODY OF PAZZI IS BEING LOWERED, IN THE
     BG WE SEE HANNIBAL, RIDING ON THE BACK OF THE MOTO, AND
     AWAY.

     CORDELL PUSHES A BUTTON ON HIS CONSOLE, AND WE SEE, ON THE
     VIDEO, MONITORS, A NURSE LEAVING THE HALLWAY AND ENTERING
     VERGER'S ROOM.  AS CORDELL TAKES THE CHILD TO HER WE SEE 
     THAT VERGER AND THE CHILD HAVE BEEN WATCHING THE PIGS ATTACK
     THE MAN-SIZED DUMMY, WHICH THEY NOW DO WITH ALACRITY.

     THROUGH THE STOUT BARS OF THEIR ENCLOSURE.

     CAMERA TAKES HIM INTO THE PIGBARN, WHERE THE GENTLEMAN, THEIR
     TRAINER, IS SEEN CONSTRUCTING A NEW ENEMY. 

                          GENTLEMAN 
                    (LOOKING UP AT CORDELL)
                It's going to be long...? 

     CORDELL SHRUGS 

                          GENTLEMAN (cont'd) 
                Is going to be much longer, we should
                feed them... 

                          CORDELL 
                Mmm.  Is it going to work? 

     THE GENTLEMAN MOVES TO A TAPE PLAYER, AND TURNS IT ON, AND WE
     HEAR A SCREAM.  HE NODS AND TURNS IT OFF. 

                          GENTLEMAN 
                The problem, if it is:  the tape is not 
                the true scream, an' the dummy, of 
                course, is not the true man.  BUT.  Yes,
                yes, I think, is close enough....

                          CORDELL 
                So:  the two problems are:  they should
                be fed, and they should practice on a 
                real... 

     THE GENTLEMAN TURNS HIS BACK ON CORDELL AND IS MOVING THE
     TAPE MACHINE. 

     ANGLE ON THE GENTLEMAN, WITH CORDELL BEHIND HIM.

                          GENTLEMAN

                back his hat, and his badge... both with
                a bullethole in them.  An' that's what he

                ...the bad news is:  we're going to stick
                your feet through those bars tomorrow,
                and feed them to our pigs.

                          VERGER
                    (VO) 
                Thank you, Cordell. 

                          LECHTER 
                    (SPEAKING GROGGILY) 
                ...but will that satisfy you? 

                          VERGER 
                Why should you care? 

                          LECHTER 
                It is not that I care for you--but
                that I posses an enquiring mind.  What
                will you do when I am gone?  When you
                have nothing to occupy your thoughts, 
                save the memory of your own folly, and,
                more to the point, stupidity. 

                          VERGER
                ARE YOU DONE?

                          LECHTER 
                    (PAUSES TO THINK, THEN, AS IF
                     SURPRISED)
                Yes. 

                          VERGER 
                You don't wish to beg...? 

                          LECHTER 
                Would that add to your mirth? 

                          VERGER 
                Explain in depth the plan we have for
                him.  Until tomorrow. 

     ANGLE ON LECHTER, AS HE LOOKS UP AT THE TV CAMERA. 

     AS CORDELL SPEAKS, HE REMOVES A KNIFE, AND BEGINS CUTTING 
     AWAY THE LEGS OF LECHTER'S PANTS, REMOVING HIS SOCKS AND
     SHOES ET CETERA.

     ANGLE HIS POV 

     THE LIGHT IN THE CAMERA FLIPS OFF.

     ANGLE 

     ON LECHTER AND CORDELL.

                          LECHTER 
                One would have thought he'd keep me
                under observation.  To savor his
                triumph. 

                          CORDELL 
                No, I think he proffers to spend his
                happy hours with his playmates. 

                          LECHTER 
                ...young boys, still...? 

                          CORDELL 
                ...here's to child abuse! 

                          LECHTER
                Mmm... 

                          CORDELL 
                ...and then, he'll be coming down. 

                          LECHTER 
                You said the bad news... 

                          CORDELL
                Yes, I did. 

                          LECHTER 
                I believe that your tone implied that 
                there was some good news.... and, do you
                know... there might be good news for
                you... 

                          CORDELL 
                Oh, yes, what?  You'd bribe me, to, to,
                to, "release" you...? 

                          LECHTER 
                I can make you rich. 

                          CORDELL 
                And I expect you to.
                    (HE LEANS CLOSER TO HANNIBAL)
                Let's talk like two medical men
                    (HE PRODUCES A SMALL CASE, 
                     WHICH HOLDS TWO HYPODERMICS)

                Come on, stay with us.  Look here:  I

                     POCKET) 
                stop your heart, an that's you done, an 
                there's an end to it.  What do you
                say...? 
                    (CORDELL REMOVES A CELLPHONE
                     FROM HIS POCKET) 
                I know you got lotsa money, evabody says
                so.  I know how that stuff works, take
                it out, move it around... 
                    (LECHER'S HEAD BEGINS TO DROOL) 
                ...stay with me now, fuss with it... 
                Whatsay we call your banker now, tell him
                a code... move that money to me, he

                    (HE HOLDS UP THE SYRINGE AND
                     SQUIRTS IT)
                Whatsay?

                     CORDELL) 

     ANGLE EXT THE BARN.

     A SOUND OF SCREAMING, THE TWO POTATOCHIP MEN RUN IN GUNS
     DRAWN, TO SEE CORDELL.  HOLDING HIS HAND TO HIS BLOODY
     FACE. 

                          MAN ONE 
                ...you wan me to shoot im? 

                          CORDELL 
                That's the last think I want...
                    (TO LECHTER) 
                Our other option is to beat you for a
                while, with this axe handle, here.  I
                suppose this is what it feels like. 

     ANGLE 

     ONE OF THE ABDUCTORS (THE POTATOCHIP MEN) GOES TO A CONSOLE
     AND TURNS ON THE SOUND OF RECORDED SCREAMING.  HE LOOKS DOWN
     AT THE PIGS WHO, HEARING THE SCREAMING, COME TO THE SIDE OF
     THE PEN.  HE LOOKS BACK TOWARD THE DIRECTION OF CORDELL, AND
     LECHTER, AND WINCES. 

     HE RAISES THE AXE HANDLE AND PREPARES TO STRIKE.

     INT VERGER'S ROOM.

     THE SHAPE OF VERGER ON THE BED.

     VERGER IS SEEN IN THE FLICKER OF THE TV SCREEN.

                          VERGER 
                Oh yes. Oh, yes, come here... Come 
                here...Up Lad, When the Journey's Over,
                they'll be time enough for Sleep... 

     WE SEE THE FORM RISE FROM THE BED, AND RISE AND WALK TOWARD
     VERGER. 

                          VERGER (cont'd} 
                Yes.  Come here.  For what good is 
                Television, Educational as it may be,
                if it is not also entertaining.....come--
                have some popcorn... 

     WE HEAR THE SOUND OF THE AXE HANDLE HITTING SOMETHING.

                          VERGER (cont'd)
                    (TO THE TV) 
                Make it last, make it last, for 
                godsake, make it last....don't "hurt" 
                him...!

     ANGLE EXT.  COUNTRY ROAD, NIGHT. 

     STARLING'S CAR, COASTING DOWN THE HILL.  THE OLD GATEHOUSE TO
     VERGER'S PROPERTY, SEEN IN THE MOONLIGHT. 

     ANGLE 

     STARLING, MOVING THROUGH THE MOONLIT NIGHT, THROUGH THE
     WOODS. 

     WE SEE THE MUSTANG, BEHIND HER, COVERED WITH BOUGHS, IN THE
     WOODS, AND BEYOND THAT, BELOW HER, THE GUARDHOUSE. 

     CAMERA TAKES HER UP TO A BARBEDWIRE FENCE, CAMOUFLAGED, WITH
     BRUSH WOVEN INTO IT.  A LARGE TREE STANDS NEXT TO THE FENCE,
     WITH A BOUGH RUNNING FROM THE NEAR SIDE TO THE FAR SIDE. 

     ANGLE, STARLING LOOKS AT IT, AND SMILES.  SHE WALKS FORWARD,
     LOOKING INTENTLY AT THE GROUND. 

     ANGLE, HER POV.  A SMALL TRIPWIRE, SUSPENDED SIX INCHES OFF
     THE GROUND, COVERS THE AREA IN FRONT OF THE SO-ATTRACTIVE
     TREE.  STARLING FOLLOWS THE TRIPWIRE DOWN, PARALLEL TO THE
     FENCE.  SHE STEPS OVER THE TRIPWIRE AND PROCEEDS DOWN,
     WATCHING THE FENCE, LOOKING INTENTLY. 

     SHE GOES INTO A GULLY WHERE WE SEE THAT A RUNOFF OF A STREAM
     IS ERODING A HOLE UNDERNEATH THE BARBEDWIRE FENCE.

     ANGLE, ON STARLING, AS SHE GETS DOWN ON THE GROUND, TAKES A
     STICK AND PROBES IN THE FLOW OF WATER UNDERNEATH THE 
     FENCE.  SHE NODS, SATISFIED, AND BEGINS TO USE THE STICK TO
     ENLARGE THE OPENING UNDER THE FENCE.

     INT VERGER' S ROOM.  NIGHT.

                          VERGER 
                I'm awake.  Oh.  Is it Time! 

     CORDELL STARTS TO PUSH THE GURNEYBED OUT OF THE ROOM.

                          VERGER (cont'd) 
                Oh, yes, one waits so long, and then, and
                then ...ALMOST BY MAGIC...Yes, proceed.
                Please.... proceed... 

     CORDELL STARTS TO EXIT.

     CAMERA SEES THE GURNEY BED, WITH VERGER ON IT, A SMALL
     COUCH, ON WHICH IS A YOUNG BOY, ASLEEP, IN FRONT OF A
     SILENT TELEVISION, A BOWL OF POPCORN BY HIM.

     EXT THE PIGBARN.  DAWN.

     ANGLE ON STARLING, ADVANCING FROM THE WOODS, PISTOL IN
     HAND.  SHE HEARS SCREAMING.  SHE HESITATES, THEN MOVES
     CLOSER. 

     ANGLE, HER POV. 

     ONE OF THE ABDUCTORS, TEASING THE PIGS, PUSHES A PAIR OF
     STUFFED DUNGAREES THROUGH THE ENCLOSURE.

     ANGLE ON STARLING, WHO TURNS HER HEAD.

     HER POV:

     AT THE MAIN HOUSE, BY THE POTATOCHIP VAN, THE GURNEY EMERGES, 
     WHEELED BY CORDELL.  IT MOVES TOWARD A FORKLIFT TRUCK.

     ANGLE AT THE GURNEY. 

                          CORDELL 
                ..It won't be long now, sir...

                          VERGER 
                OHFORGODSAKE, get ON with it. 

     CORDELL MOVES TO THE FORKLIFT, STARTS IT, AND IT MOVES
     TOWARD THE GURNEY.

     ANGLE ON STARLING, AS SHE WATCHES THE FORKLIFT GENTLY PICK UP
     VERGER IN THE GURNEYBED.  THE SOUND OF SCREAMING STOPS. 

     SHE SEES THE ABDUCTOR TURN OFF THE MUSIC, AND RETREAT INTO
     THE BARN.

     ANGLE 

     STARLING, MOVING ALONGSIDE THE PIG'S ENCLOSURE.

     SHE MOVES TO A WALL OF THE BARN.

     ANGLE HER POV IN THE BARN.  LECHTER, MANACLED AND BOUND TO A 
     BEAM. 

     SHE SEES AN ABDUCTOR MOVING TOWARD HIM.  LOWERING HIS BEAM TO
     THE GROUND, AND THEN MOVING OFF, INTO THE TACKROOM, OFF.

     ANGLE IN THE BARN.

     STARLING BURSTS INTO THE TACKROOM.

                          STARLING 
                    (TO THE ABDUCTOR) 
                On the ground, on the ground... 

     SHE MOVES TO HIM, AS HE COMPLIES, AND REMOVES HANDCUFFS, AND
     CUFFS THE MAN AROUND A POLE.  HE STARTS TO REMONSTRATE, AND
     SHE HITS HIM ON THE HEAD WITH HER GUNBUTT.  SHE EXITS THE
     TACKROOM, AND ENTERS THE BARN AND ADVANCES ON THE MAULED
     AND BEATEN FORM OF LECHTER.

                          LECHTER 
                Good morning, Clarice. 

                          STARLING 
                Can you walk?  Are your legs working...? 

                          LECHTER
                Perhaps... shall we see...? 

                          STARLING 
                I'm going to cut you loose.  With all due
                respect, Doctor, if you fuck with me,
                I'll shoot you dead, do you 
                understand...?  Do right and you'll live
                through this. 

                          LECHTER 
                Spoken like a Protestant. 

     STARLING TAKES OUT A KNIFE, AND BEGINS TO CUT THE DOCTOR LOOSE. 

                          LECHTER (cont'd) 
                I'll do the rest, if you give me the
                knife. 

     SHE LOOKS OVER HIS SHOULDER, AT THE FORKLIFT COMING DOWN THE
     HILL. 

                          STARLING 
                No, I don't think so. 

     LECHTER HAS FREED HIMSELF, AND IS CHAFING HIS LIMBS TO
     RESTORE CIRCULATION. 

                          STARLING (cont'd) 
                    (AS SHE POINTS TO THE FORKLIFT) 
                I'm going to subdue our friends, coming
                down the hill, and I want you to cuff 
                em, and to put em inside with the other
                fella... My car is

                two of them...?

     DARTGUN.  HE FIRES. 

     ANGLE CU 

     ON STARLING, WHO EXTRACTS A DART FROM HER BICEP.  SHE LOOKS
     AROUND, AND FALLS, DAZILY.  HER PISTOL FALLS THROUGH THE BARS
     INTO THE PIGPEN.

     ANGLE 

     ON THE MAN IN THE LOFT, AS HE RELOADS, AND SIGHTS ON 
     LECHTER, WHO IS KNEELING BY STARLING.  WE SEE LECHTER PICK UP
     HER PISTOL, AND FIRE AT THE MAN IN THE LOFT. 

     ANGLE.  THE MAN IN THE LOFT, HE FALLS AGAINST A RAILING, HE
     DROPS HIS DARTRIFLE. 

     IT DROPS INTO THE PIG'S PEN.

                What's happening, would you please...?

     ANGLE 

     ON LECHTER, AS HE MOVES TO STARLING, AND PULLS HER AWAY FROM 
     THE PIGPEN, HE TRIES TO REACH THROUGH THE BARS FOR HER
     PISTOL, BUT IT IS JUST OUT OF REACH. 

     HE LOOKS UP.

     ANGLE

     ON VERGER AND CORDELL, APPROACHING LECHTER.

                          CORDELL 
                Stop there, would you, please, Doctor...?

                          LECHTER
                The girl could use some help. 

                          VERGER
                You're free... 

                          LECHTER 
                ...which of us is free...? 

                          VERGER 
                Yes, to cease to Hope is the Greatest 
                Crime.  The Greatest crime.  Perhaps the
                only crime.  I never ceased to hope! 

                          LECHTER 
                The girl needs help. 

                          VERGER 
                And what would be of Greater Help, than
                to release her, from the bonds of this
                sordid earthly existence.  DON'T YOU
                THINK?  IN WHICH THE INNOCENT ARE 
                TORTURED IN WAYS WHICH WOULD MAKE THE
                ANGUISH OF THE DAMNED SEEM TAME AND 
                UNIMAGINATIVE, DON'T YOU THINK?  BLIND
                HIM AGAIN, AND PREPARE HIM AND HER FOR
                THE PIGS! 
                    (CORDELL, HOLDING A GUN,

                          LECHTER
                Let the girl go. 

                          CORDELL
                Why? 

                          LECHTER 
                For a consideration. 

                          CORDELL 
                'fraid it's too late. 

                          VERGER
                ...when I...
                    (PAUSE) 

     CORDELL CONTINUES THE FINAL PREPARATIONS OF LECHTER.

                          LECHTER 
                ...what has she done to harm you...? 

                          CORDELL 
                Yes, do you know, you're right...
                    (HE PAUSES) 
                ...Mr. Verger...? 
                    (PAUSE)
                Mr. Verger, Sir?  He's ready...
                    (PAUSE) 

     ANGLE ON CORDELL, AS HE LEAVES THE TRUSSED LECHTER, STEPPING 
     OVER STARLING, AND PROCEEDS BACK TOWARD THE GURNEY, WHICH IS
     HALF HIDDEN BY THE PIGPEN. 

     ANGLE 

     HIS POV.  AS HE COMES AROUND THE CORNER, THE CHILD 
     FRANKLIN HAS THE BOWL OF POPCORN, AND IS SEEN FEEDING POPCORN 
     TO VERGER.

     ANGLE CORDELL'S POV. 

     THE LIFESIGNS DISPLAY OF VERGER.  A SINGLE BLIP, A LONG
     PAUSE, ANOTHER IRREGULAR BLIP.  A LONG PAUSE. 

     ANGLE CORDELL, AS HE ADVANCES ON THE CHILD.

                          CORDELL (cont'd) 
                Hey, Franklin.  Hey.  Tell you what, if
                you'd just stop doing that, I'm going to
                give you something nice. 

                          FRANKLIN 
                He don't like popcorn. 

                          CORDELL
                No.  And... 

                          FRANKLIN
                I like Popcorn... 

                          CORDELL 
                ...yes, if you'll, just step away... 

                          FRANKLIN 
                You give me whatever I want...? 

                          CORDELL 
                Yes.  You know I will.  That's right. 

                          FRANKLIN
                Awright. 

     FRANKLIN STEPS AWAY.  AND CORDELL RUNS UP TO VERGER AND
     TRIES TO REVIVE HIM.

     ANGLE 

     ON FRANKLIN, AS HE MOVES AROUND THE PEN, AND PULLS A LEVER
     WHICH OPENS THE GATE.

     ANGLE 

     ON THE PIGS, AS THEY START TO MOVE INTO THE AREA OCCUPIED BY
     CORDELL AND VERGER.

     ANGLE 

     ON FRANKLIN.

                          FRANKLIN (cont'd) 
                You know what I want...? 

     ANGLE 

     ON CORDELL, BENT OVER VERGER, AS HE LOOKS BACK. 

     ANGLE ON FRANKLIN. 

                          FRANKLIN (cont'd)
                I WANT KITTYKAT!!!

     ANGLE 

     ON CORDELL, AS HE SEES THE PIGS APPROACHING, HE STARTS TO
     SCREAM.

     ANGLE 

     ON FRANKLIN, AS HE CLIMBS UP TO THE AREA WHERE WE SEE
     LECHTER. 

                          LECHTER 
                Let me down, son, let me down. 

                          FRANKLIN 
                What'll you do for me? 

                          LECHTER 
                I'll take you home. 

                          FRANKLIN
                Ain't got no home. 

                          LECHTER 
                Then what would you like...? 

     FRANKLIN COMES OVER AND WHISPERS TO HIM.

     ANGLE 

     ON HANNIBAL, AS HE RECOILS.  BEAT.  THE SOUND OF
     SCREAMING STOPS.

     PAUSE 

                          HANNIBAL
                    (PAUSE) 
                Yes.  You shall have it... 

                          FRANKLIN 
                Then you goin to hell... 

                          HANNIBAL
                ...that's right... 

     FRANKLIN LOOSES THE ROPE WHICH HOLDS LECHTER, AND LECHTER
     ENTERS THE PIGPEN.  WE SEE THE PIGS, AT THE FAR END, 
     SAVAGING WHAT WE ASSUME TO BE THE FORMS OF VERGER AND
     CORDELL. 

     ANGLE 

     ON HANNIBAL, AS HE STOOPS TO THE FORM OF STARLING, AND 
     GATHERS HER UP.  THE PIGS ADVANCE ON HIM, AND THEN STOP...
     HE STEPS THROUGH THEM, AND OUT OF THE BARN. 

     ANGLE EXT THE BARN. 

     STARLING, PUT DOWN IN THE GRASS.  BEAT.  SHE STIRS.  SHE HALF-
     OPENS HER EYES.

     ANGLE, HER POV LECHTER, WALKING TOWARD HER, BEHIND HIM THE
     VERGER ESTATE BURSTING INTO ROARING FLAMES.

     ANGLE 

     ON FRANKLIN, STANDING BY THE FLAMES, LOOKING AT LECHTER, AS
     HE WALKS UP TOWARD STARLING. 

     ANGLE 

     ON LECHTER, AS HE PICKS UP STARLING, WE SEE A SECURITY CAR
     COMING DOWN THE DRIVE, AS LECHTER AND STARLING FADE INTO
     THE WOODS. 

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

     INT SUMPTUOUS, ELEGANT DININGROOM.

     STARLING, IN A DECOLLETE EVENING GOWN, STANDING IN FRONT OF 
     A PERFECT PRESENTATION OF BACCARAT AND LIMOGES.

     ANGLE HER POV.

     LECHTER, IN A TUXEDO, STANDING AGAINST THE BALCONY OF THE 
     ROOM, WHICH LOOKS OUT ON THE SEA.  HE SMILES AT HER.

                          LECHTER
                You look lovely. 

                          STARLING
                Thank you. 
                    (SHE MOVES TO SIT, AND 
                     LECHTER COMES UP AND HOLDS
                     HER CHAIR FOR HER) 
                No, I know you'd prefer "I'm glad you
                find me so..."

                          LECHTER 
                I'd prefer you to say what you feel. 

                          STARLING
                What is that that smells so wonderful. 

                          LECHTER 
                I hope you'll find it so. 
                    (HE POURS HER A GLASS OF
                     WINE) 
                Yes.  It's good to see you regaining 
                your strength... 

                          STARLING
                Thanks to you... 

     WE SEE LECHTER EXCUSE HIMSELF, AND RETIRE INTO THE KITCHEN.
     WE SEE HIM TAKING DOWN SAUCEPANS, AND MIXING WHAT APPEARS TO
     BE A MARINADE.

                          LECHTER
                Now, what were we last speaking of...? 

                          STARLING 
                We were speaking of my father... 

     LECHTER POURS THE MARINADE INTO A PAN, LIGHTS THE FLAME IN
     THE STOVE, WIPES HIS HANDS, AND RETURNS TO THE DININGROOM. 

                          LECHTER
                ...I'm sorry....? 

                          STARLING 
                ...we were speaking of my father... 

                          LECHTER
                Indeed we were. 

                          STARLING 
                ...and my need for The Institution... 

                          LECHTER 
                Freud, do you know...?  Freud 
                psychoanalyzed patients in One Afternoon. 

                          STARLING 
                And how did he do that? 

                          LECHTER 
                He saw the truth, and spoke it... 

                          STARLING 
                I'm afraid, this wine is making me
                woozy... 

                          LECHTER 
                ...you have to eat... 

     LECHTER RETURNS TO THE KITCHEN, INDICATING "ONE MOMENT." 

                          LECHTER (cont'd) 
                    (AS THE CAMERA TAKES HIM TO 
                     THE KITCHEN, AND WE HALF-SEE
                     THE TORSO OF A MAN SITTING
                     IN A KITCHEN CHAIR) 
                You've sought out The Institution all 
                your life, as you with it to replace your
                Father.  This is obvious.  Less obvious
                is this:  that you require the 
                institution not to support you, but to 
                FAIL.  FOR THIS KEEPS YOUR FATHER ALIVE. 

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, SITTING, NODDING, AS SHE DRINKS HER WINE.  SHE
     PUTS THE GLASS DOWN, A TRIFLE WOOZY. 

                          LECHTER (cont'd) 
                ...as this keeps your father alive.  The
                truth is two-fold, and the truth is one: 

     THE WIND FROM THE OCEAN BLOWS A STRAND OF HAIR ACROSS HER
     EYES, SHE BRUSHES IT BACK. 

                          LECHTER (cont'd)
                    (VO) 
                That every man is fallible, that every
                institution, being made of men, cannot
                but be corrupt... 

     ANGLE ON STARLING, LOOKING DOWN AT HER HAND. 

     ANGLE HER POV. 

     THE HAND IS COVERED WITH MUD AND BLOOD.

     ANGLE, STARLING, LOOKING PERPLEXED, AT THE KITCHEN WHERE WE 
     SEE THE FORM OF LECHTER, MOVING ACROSS THE KITCHEN.

     ANGLE 

     ON LECHTER.

     AS WE SEE, HE CARRIES A SCALPEL, HE MOVES TOWARD THE HALF-
     SEEN FORM OF THE MAN IN THE CHAIR.

     HE BENDS DOWN OVER THE MAN, AND WE SEE THAT HE CARRIES A
     SCALPEL AND A SMALL MEDICAL SAW... 

                          LECHTER (cont'd) 
                ...the only art in this dish, of course,
                is that it must be fresh... 

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, IN THE ROOM, AS SHE PICKS UP A SMALL ROSEBUD
     FROM THE CUT CRYSTAL BUDVASE IN FRONT OF HER.

     SHE LOOKS AT IT WOOZILY, AND IT FALLS FROM HER FINGERS.
     SHE BENDS DOWN.

     ANGLE, HER POV, THE FLOOR.

     THE ROSEBUD, ON A FILTHY, TORN LINOLEUM FLOOR, HER LEGS
     ENCASED IN THE MUDDY PANTS WE SAW HER IN AT VERGER'S FARM. 

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE STRAIGHTENS, HOLDING THE ROSE.  WE SEE A
     LOOK OF CONSTERNATION ON HER FACE.  HER FACE IS BLOODY, AND
     COVERED IN MUD, WE SEE SHE IS NOT IN A SUMPTUOUS
     DININGROOM, BUT IN A SLUM. 

     ANGLE HER POV 

     LECHTER, IN THE KITCHEN, IN TUXEDO, MOVING PAST THE DOORWAY.

     ANGLE INT THE KITCHEN.

     LECHTER, AS WE NOW SEE, IN THE FILTHY KITCHEN OF A SLUM. 
     COOKING ON A HOTPLATE.  DRESSED IN WORKCLOTHES, CAMERA TAKES
     HIM, FROM BEHIND, TO THE SLUMPED FORM OF THE MAN, CAMERA CUTS
     OFF AT THE MAN'S SHOULDERS, WE SEE LECHTER, FROM THE BACK,
     LIFTING SOMETHING FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE MAN'S HEAD, AND
     CARRYING IT BACK TO THE FILTHY TABLETOP, WHERE, AS HE SPEAKS,
     HE BEGINS KNEADING IT WITH FLOUR, WE SEE THE PAN SIZZLING
     ON THE HOTPLATE. 

     ANGLE 

     IN THE SLUM ROOM.  STARLING, DAZED, AND LECHTER, REENTERING. 

                          LECHTER (cont'd) 
                That the institution cannot but be 
                corrupt, and, therefore, it cannot be
                but an act of complicity to seek to
                appease it. 

     HE MOVES BACK INTO THE KITCHEN, PUTS THE BREADED PIECES OF
     CUTLET INTO THE PAN, THE FIRE SHOOTS UP. 

                          LECHTER (cont'd) 
                So many civilizations eat their slain
                enemies... what do you think...?  How
                much better to devour a person 
                physically, than to devour his spirit. 
                Which is, of course, the purpose of the
                institution. 

     HE REMOVES THE MEAT FROM THE PAN, AND FORKS IT ONTO A TIN
     PLATE.

                          LECHTER (cont'd) 
                    (REENTERING THE DININGROOM) 
                :and that is the especial surprise,
                I've prepared for You! 

                          STARLING
                I feel weak... 

                          LECHTER
                    (NODDING) 
                ...you must eat. 

     SHE LOOKS DOWN AT THE TABLE.  SHE PICKS UP HER FORK.

     ANGLE HER POV 

     THE LOVELY LINEN TABLE, THE STEAMING MEAT ON THE LIMOGES
     PLATE. 

     A HUGE COCKROACH, SCURRYING ACROSS THE TABLECLOTH.

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE RISES, UNSTEADILY, IN HER MUDDY
     CLOTHES...

                          STARLING 
                ...1 don't understand... 

     SHE WALKS TOWARD THE BALCONY WINDOW, LOOKING OUT AT THE
     OCEAN.

     ANGLE HER POV. 

     OUT THE WINDOW, A SQUALID CITY STREET, SEEN FROM THE THIRD
     FLOOR. 

     A COUPLE OF CARS STOPPING AT THE END OF THE STREET.

     ANGLE, ON STARLING, AS SHE TURNS BACK TOWARD LECHTER.

                          LECHTER
                    (IN THE KITCHEN) 
                The gift, of course is not the meal--
                but the identification--which of us does
                not need help?  The identity, of your
                true enemy...? 
                ...for you always sought to befriend, to
                wish the love of those who wished you ill. 

     ANGLE, ON LECHTER, STANDING BEFORE THE FIGURE TIED TO THE
     CHAIR. 

                          LECHTER (cont'd) 
                Come here--he is in no pain, there are
                no nerves in the brain, come here... 

     ANGLE, LECHTER'S POV THE FIGURE OF CRAWFORD TIED TO THE
     CHAIR. 

     LECHTER MOVES TO HIM AND EXTRACTS FROM HIS UPPER POCKET, A
     XEROX OF THE PHOTO OF THE BADGE WITH THE HOLE IN IT. 

                          LECHTER (CONT'D) 
                Come here, I'm going to cure you. 

     ANGLE HIS POV. 

     STARLING, IN THE SLUMROOM, LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW.

     ANGLE 

     STARLING, DAZED, LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW, LECHTER COMES 
     UP BEHIND HER, AND LOOKS OUT.

     ANGLE HIS POV. 

     THE SLUM STREET, A VAN NOW PULLING UP, A SQUAD OF SWAT 
     OFFICERS APPROACHING A PARKED CAR.

     ANGLE

     ON LECHTER AND CLARICE.

     LECHTER APPROACHES HER.

     ANGLE HIS POV, 

     STARLING, IN THE BEAUTIFUL GOWN, HE MOVES AS IF TO CARESS 
     HER BREAST.

     ANGLE ON STARLING, AS SHE LOOKS DOWN.  WE SEE SHE IS NOW
     CLOTHED IN HER FILTHY CLOTHES, AND LECHTER IS FRISKING
     HER. 

     ANGLE 

     LECHTER, FRISKING THE FILTHY STARLING, TAKES OUT THE
     MARINECORP HATBADGE, WHICH WE SAW EARLIER, HE BREAKS IT
     OPEN, AND REVEALS A MICROTRANSMITTER.

                          LECHTER (cont'd) 
                Oh, no.  Oh, NO.  They've put a beeper on
                you.  How careless of me.  How finally 
                careless, Do you think?  Have I erred on
                Purpose?  Eh?  Or am I just unlucky? 
                Could one not say that's the essential
                question of Philosophy...? 

     ANGLE ON STARLING, DAZED, LOOKING ON.

                          STARLING 
                Might I have some more of the wine...? 

     ANGLE ON LECHTER, AS HE MOVES TO A BACK WINDOW.

     STARLING, AS SHE RISES, AGAIN, IN HER BALLGOWN. 

                          STARLING (cont'd) 
                Because, I find I like the effects.  You
                may say that it's inebriation, but it
                seems 
                    (SHE SMILES) 
                This lovely evening, in particular.... it 
                seems to reward me with clarity...
                    (SHE LAUGHS) 

     THERE IS A SOUND BEHIND HER.  THE BEAUTIFUL FRENCHDOORS 
     OPEN AND ADMIT A HAPPY COTERIE OF GOWNED WOMEN AND FORMAL
     DRESSED MEN, THEY ARE ALL CHATTERING THEIR JOY AT SEEING 
     HER. 

                          STARLING (cont'd) 
                ....or perhaps, it is just the heat... I
                was just saying to the Doctor...
                    (SHE GESTURES) 

     ANGLE HER POV THE OPEN WINDOW, THE SHADES BLOWING.

     CAMERA COMES BACK TO STARLING, WHO IS IN HER RAGS, WITH THE
     SWAT TEAM ENTERING THE ROOM. 

                          STARLING (cont'd) 
                But, do you know, do you know, I'm not
                feeling altogether.... 

     SHE SWOONS.  A SWAT MAN CATCHES HER.

                          SWAT MAN
                ...I've got her... 

     ANGLE 

     IN THE SLUMROOM, WE SEE THAT A SWAT TEAM HAS ENTERED.  ONE OF
     THEM HAS CAUGHT THE FAINTING STARLING IN HIS ARMS.  THE
     SEVERAL MEN PROCEED TOWARD THE BACK OF THE KITCHEN. 

                          STARLING 
                    (AS WE SEE SHE IS IN 
                     KRENDLER'S ARMS)
                ...may be the heat....

                          KRENDLER 
                Let's get her out of here....

     SWAT OFFICER, FROM THE KITCHEN.  AS HE GAZES IN THE
     DIRECTION OF CRAWFORD.

                          STARLING 
                But as my father used to say...

                          SWAT OFFICER
                    (IN KITCHEN)
                ...ohmiGod. 

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT TEXAS GRAVEYARD DAY. 

     A NEW MARBLE HEADSTONE BEING LOWERED ONTO A GRAVE.  IT IS
     ORNATE AND SOLID, AND READS:  JAMES RANDALL STARLING, HUSBAND
     AND FATHER.  DIED 1975.

     ANGLE 

     STARLING STANDING BY THE GRAVE, HOLDING FLOWERS, BEHIND HER
     STAND MAPP AND HER BOYFRIEND.  BEHIND THEM STAND AN OFFICIAL
     LOOKING MAN, WHO HOLDS HIS STETSON, REVERENTLY, IN FRONT OF
     HIM.  IN THE BG WE SEE A TRUCK MOVING SLOWLY DOWN THE
     DUSTY CEMETERY ROAD. 

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE KNEELS, AS THE STONE IS PLACED,
     PUTTING A SMALL BOUQUET OF FLOWERS NEXT TO IT.  AS SHE 
     KNEELS, AND CAMERA CRANES DOWN, WE READ THE BOTTOM OF THE
     INSCRIPTION:  "DIED 1975.  HE WILL NEVER KNOW HOW HE WAS
     MISSED." 

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE STANDS, AND MAPP COMES, AND PUTS HER ARM
     AROUND HER.

                          MAPP 
                That's why it's a stone, you know, It
                means Don't Come Back. 

     STARLING NODS, AND THEY TURN AWAY, AND WALK AWAY FROM THE
     GRAVE.  IN THE BG WE SEE ANOTHER GROUP OF MOURNERS, WEARING
     WESTERN GARB.  STARLING AND HER GROUP CROSS A SERVICE ROAD,
     IN FRONT OF THE OLD TRUCK.

                          STARLING 
                Well.  No.  He can't come back. 

                          MAPP 
                Baby, that's the beginning of wisdom. 

     MAPP PUTS HER ARM AROUND STARLING, AS THEY WALK OFF.
     STARLING NODS, THAT SHE UNDERSTANDS, AND LAYS HER HEAD ON
     MAPP'S SHOULDER.

     WE SEE SEVERAL GRAVEDIGGERS SITTING ON THE BACK.  THE MAN IN
     THE PASSENGER SEAT, WEARING A STRAW WESTERN HAT, TURNS, TO
     LOOK AT STARLING AND THE GROUP.  IT LOOKS LIKE LECHTER. 

     ANGLE ON STARLING, AND HER GROUP, AS THE MAN IN THE TRUCK
     MOMENTARILY CATCHES HER EYE. 

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE WALKS THROUGH THE GRAVEYARD. 

     A GLINT OF LIGHT PLAYS ACROSS HER FACE, AND SHE SQUINTS.

     ANGLE HER POV. 

     THE LIGHT HITTING THE SHOVEL OF THE GRAVEDIGGER IN THE 
     STRAW HAT.  THE GRAVEDIGGER IS HALF HIDDEN BY THE GROUP HE
     WALKS WITH. 

     ANGLE 

     OVER MAPP, WHO IS TALKING, AND ONTO STARLING, AS SHE STARES
     AT THE GRAVEDIGGER, WHO IS APPROACHING HER. 

     ANGLE 

     ON HER BODY, AS SHE REACHES TO HER BELT FOR A SIDEARM.

     ANGLE

     TIGHT ON THE TWO WOMEN, AS STARLING LEANS IN.

                          STARLING 
                    (SOTTO) 
                Give me your gun... 

     ANGLE 

     ON MAPP, AS SHE LOOKS AT STARLING.

                          MAPP 
                ...what...?

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE LOOKS AT THE APPROACHING FIGURE.

     ANGLE HER POV 

     THE GRAVEDIGGER, AS HE EMERGES FROM THE GROUP.  WE SEE HE IS 
     A NONDESCRIPT LABORER.

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING AND MAPP.

                          MAPP (cont'd) 
                ...what, what did you say...?

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE SHAKES HER HEAD.

     ANGLE

     ON THE LABORER, AS HE PASSES BY AN ARRIVING, OLDER LIMOUSINE, 
     STARLING AND MAPP IN THE BACKGROUND.

     ANGLE

     ON STARLING AND MAPP, AS MAPP AND JIM TAKE THEIR LEAVE FROM
     STARLING, WHO IS INDICATING, "I JUST WANT TO BE ALONE FOR A
     WHILE." 

     WE SEE MAPP NOD, AS SHE AND JIM GET INTO THEIR CAR.

     ANGLE ON STARLING, AS SHE WALKS BACK TOWARD HER FATHER'S 
     GRAVE PAST A SMALL BLACK CLAD FAMILY, WHO ARE EMERGING FROM
     THE LIMO.

     ANGLE XCU 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE LOOKS AT THE OFFENDING FIGURE.

     ANGLE HER POV.

     THE MAN TURNS MORE TO CAMERA, AND WE SEE HE IS A NONDESCRIPT 
     LABORER.

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE TAKES HER LEAVE OF MAPP AND MAPP'S
     FRIEND, WE SEE THEM PASS BY ANOTHER SMALL FUNERAL, SEVERAL
     BLACK CLAD MOURNERS AND AN OLD LIMOUSINE, AT THE GRAVESIDE. 

     STARLING CHATS WITH MAPP FOR A MOMENT, OBVIOUSLY SAYING SHE,
     STARLING, WANTS TO STAY ON AT THE GRAVE.  MAPP NODS, AND SHE
     AND HER FRIEND GET INTO THEIR CAR AND DRIVE AWAY.

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE PASSES BY THE OTHER FUNERAL, BACK TOWARD
     HER FATHER'S GRAVE. 

     ANGLE INT THE LIMO.  WE SEE, THROUGH ITS WINDSHIELD, STARLING
     CROSS, AND MOVE OUT OF FRAME. 

     WE SEE THE BLACK COATED ARM OF THE LIMO DRIVER MOVE.  HIS
     HAND COMES UP TO THE REARVIEW MIRROR, AND WE SEE STARLING IN
     THE REARVIEW MIRROR, AND WE SEE THE DRIVER'S HAND HAS THE
     SMALL SCAR IN THE SHAPE OF THE NUMERAL THREE.

     FADE OUT.
