</p><p></p><p id="act">WIDE ANGLE MED. LONG SHOT
</p><p></p><p id="act">WE SEE a palm-lined richly attractive street in a Los Angeles suburb. The houses are set back from the street; the street itself is quiet, empty -- except for a few cars parked in front of the houses. While the camera takes no notice, the tires are down on the parked cars, the lawns of the houses are uncut. A Ford experimental model convertible turns corner INTO VIEW. It drives at a medium speed.
</p><p></p><p id="act">MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE IN CAR - HEAD ON
</p><p></p><p id="act">ROBERT NEVILLE is driving car. He wears sunglasses, a sport shirt, a neckerchief, and looks altogether like a wealthy man out for a drive. CAMERA ALLOWS CAR TO PULL ABREAST, so that SHOT BECOMES SIDE ANGLE. As the CAMERA ENTERS passenger space of the car, we HEAR MUSIC, "Everybody's Out Of Town." Neville hums along with it. He seems at ease, unconcerned. We SEE the houses on his right side passing by. Then his humming stops, his jaw tightens. The car stops with vicious suddenness, and CAMERA PULLS BACK to MED. SHOT, as if aghast at the sight to follow. Neville, in a single motion of astonishing speed, comes up with a stun gun in his right hand, fires directly INTO CAMERA.
</p><p></p><p id="act">REVERSE SHOT - DARKENED BALCONY WINDOW OF HOUSE
</p><p></p><p id="act">CAMERA ZOOMS IN from MED. LONG to MED. CLOSE SHOT of a deeply shadowed window in one of the houses. Bullets smash into the frame of the window, tear out chunks of the stucco. We SEE, barely, a figure fall backward. We cannot see any details of the figure. Its presence is more intuited than seen.
</p><p></p><p id="act">CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S FACE
</p><p></p><p id="act">IN F.G. is Neville’s stun gun, almost obscuring his features. FREEZE-FRAME.

</p><p></p><p id="act">At edge, we begin to SEE RADAR-STYLE BLIPS approaching North American continent from East.

</p><p></p><p id="act">PROCESS SHOT - MISSILES EXPLODING
</p><p></p><p id="act">Color of explosions should be geared to the color of water in the plaza fountain, which is perhaps illuminated by CAMERA orange and red and yellow spots under the water. IMAGE BLURS at explosion.
</p><p></p><p id="act">CAMERA MOVES DOWNWARD from explosion, picking up earth far below, keeps going down more and more rapidly, finally BLURRING In speed.
</p><p></p><p id="act">VERY HIGH SHOT - SHOPPING CENTER
</p><p></p><p id="act">CAMERA is still going DOWN, less rapidly. This SHOT seems to follow out of preceding one. At first, we SEE the shopping center, then SHOT CENTERS at the sidewalk In front of a single store. It is a Saturday afternoon, hundreds of people milling about, many oars moving. SHOT-finally NARROWS down on a single man walking out of store. CAMERA MOVES TO CLOSE SHOT. Man looks vaguely troubled, then panicked, grabs his eyes, his head CAMERA MOVES IN for a VERY CLOSE SHOT of his face, then his mouth alone as he opens It to give a blood curdling HOWL of agony and fear.

</p><p></p><p id="act">The elevator opens directly into penthouse. Neville coming OUT into his fortress-apartment. In left F.G. of SHOT is silhouette of profile of what appears to be a man in a military--cap. Neville drops stun gun slowly to the floor, looks around room, his eyes light on figure.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">NEVILLE
</p><p id="dia">Okay, Okay, I’m ready.
</p><p></p><p id="act">CAMERA MOVES PAST SILHOUETTE, MOVES ACROSS LARGE ORNATE CHESSBOARD in middle F.G. to MED. SHOT on Neville-. He pulls off dirty shirt, tosses it aside, walks to his left. CAMERA STAYS ON HIM.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">NEVILLE
</p><p id="dia">Go ahead ... move.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Neville walks into what seems another world, as CAMERA TURNS to FOLLOW HIM. It is a very long gallery-like room with many mahogany bookcases, walls covered with major paintings, pieces of sculpture here and there. He walks to a beautiful and ornate bar-liquor-cabinet, takes down a bottle of fine scotch. He pauses and studies the label as he twists off the cap. He speaks back over his shoulder.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">NEVILLE
</p><p id="dia">Why don’t you have a belt? It might improve your game.
</p><p></p><p id="act">He takes a long pull from the bottle, then moves on to the far end of the room where we can SEE a beautiful bed, armoire, old fashioned wash-basin, mirror, etc. These are perhaps screened off from the rest of the long gallery area by some bookcases set at right angles to the wall, forming a small chamber behind. CAMERA STAYS at ENTRANCE to SMALL CHAMBER. Neville rummages for a clean shirt, slips it on.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">NEVILLE
</p><p id="dia">But tonight you're going to lose. Luck over skill...
</p><p></p><p id="act">CAMERA MOVES IN QUICKLY FOR CLOSE SHOT showing that beneath is sardonic humor, Neville’s loneliness and isolation tell on him.
</p><p></p><p id="act">MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE
</p><p></p><p id="act">He still carries glass, and is rummaging again, this time in a storage cabinet. It is white, antiseptic, very large. It contains a multitude of canned goods. Neville gets out a can of beans. He moves to stainless steel refrigerator, also large, gets out a summer sausage, and ice cubes and a chilled glass for scotch.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">NEVILLE
</p><p id="dia">You hear all that downstairs? I let sundown catch me out. So he took the gambit and threw away a few pawns. I was lucky...
</p><p></p><p id="act">Neville opens can, cuts casing off one end of sausage. CAMERA moves OUT to MED. SHOT, showing this opposite end of apartment. It is as stark, barren and utilitarian as the other end is cultivated and civilized. In it are kitchen facilities, laboratory equipment, and a massive arsenal. (See Appendix for more on apartment)
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">NEVILLE
</p><p id="dia">From time to time he gets nervous. He smells the end game coming...
</p><p></p><p id="act">Neville is looking toward center of room as he talks. CAMERA MOVES BACK so as to place chessboard once more in middle F.G.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Neville is walking toward board, scotch bottle and glass In one hand, beans (with spoon in can) in other. Summer sausage Is slang across his shoulder, held by string looped over finger of hand holding beans. He saunters to board, looks down studying situation. We now have time to SEE that the board, and its pieces, are both large and superb: a museum-quality set.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">NEVILLE
</p><p id="dia">But end games are fall of surprises, aren’t they? Ummm. My move, and discovered ... check!
</p><p></p><p id="act">He puts down beans and sausage on edge of table, and moves knight, revealing check from his queen on opponent's king. Neville smiles and sits down.
</p><p></p><p id="act">MED. SHOT - ACROSS BOARD - NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW
</p><p></p><p id="act">We find that his partner is a bust of Caesar propped in the chair with an old and badly battered garrison cap on it. Cap bears eagle Insignia of colonel. CAMERA MOVES TO TWO SHOT. Neville studies board, absently presses a switch located under the table. After a moment, we HEAR MUSIC. It is Frankie Laine singing "We'll Be Together Again."
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">RECORD
</p><p id="dia">No tears, no fears, we both have a lifetime before us... So what if we have to part, we'll be together again...
</p><p></p><p id="act">Neville hits reject switch. Another tune, instrumental COMES ON. "Harlem Nocturne," Ted Heath's orchestra; alto sax solo.
</p><p></p><p id="act">MED. SHOT -NEVILLE AT CHESS BOARD
</p><p></p><p id="act">Neville makes a move on board. As he does, we HEAR NOISE, COMMOTION outside. Breaking glass, yells. Neville stands, studying board Intently. As the noise INCREASES, CAMERA MOVES to CLOSE SHOT of his FACE. His jaw tightens at he tries to Ignore the SOUNDS.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ZACHARY (O.S.)
</p><p id="dia">Come out, Neville
</p><p></p><p id="act">Neville sighs, smiles at bust.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">NEVILLE
</p><p id="dia">Excuse me, won't you. Just for a moment.
</p><p></p><p id="act">He walks quietly to window, reaches down and picks up a Springfield 1903 rifle with a Sniperscope attached. He steps to the window. The windows are full-length and open onto a narrow balcony. All along the balcony rail, spaced every thirty feet or so, are floodlights pointed down into plaza in front of building. Neville has knocked out partitions between portions of balcony so as to have access to flood lights all along building. Down below In plaza or courtyard, there Is a large and brightly illuminated fountain, water bubbling In it, cascading from level to another. Neville stares out over darkened city. In far distance, perhaps a mile away, we SEE a fire start up, blaze higher.

</p><p></p><p id="act">CAMERA PULLS BACK, revealing Zachary. He Is like Matthias, white with sunglasses. But his hair Is natural and his features clearly African. Zachary speaks defensively.

</p><p></p><p id="act">We SEE that a group of five or six others who are like Matthias have gathered around while others continue destruction in B.G. The group mumble amongst themselves, shake their heads. Matthias answers him, as if he were explaining to a child.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MATTHIAS
</p><p id="dia">Oh, yes, Brother, you could do that. Any one of us could. But if we did, the curse would begin once more, don't you see that?

</p><p></p><p id="act">The street is one of those with many apartment-hotels, etc., as on portions of Wilshire Blvd. SHOT is through trees, grass is tall in the-lawns, etc. We HEAR NOTHING at first but BIRDS. Then we HEAR the SOUND of someone RUNNING. CAMERA TURNS, finds a LONE FIGURE RUNNING TOWARD IT. SHOT. should be made INTO RISING SUN, sun rays refracted and diffused around dark silhouette of figure.
</p><p></p><p id="act">MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE RUNNING
</p><p></p><p id="act">He is in sweat suit, the shirt has JOHNS HOPKINS in large letters on front, his stun gun is on sling over shoulder, canteen and pouches in utility belt at waist. Flashlight, knife, etc. There is also a small tape recorder hung on belt. Neville continues to run, looking from time to time at numbers on buildings. At last he stops in front of a building, inspects it. He is breathing hard.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">NEVILLE
</p><p id="dia">...And Big Bob Neville shakes off the last of the tacklers and scores with fifty thousand fans tearing up the stands... Another six for Hopkins...yea. Neville.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">NEVILLE

</p><p></p><p id="act">MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE
</p><p></p><p id="act">He unlimbers stun gun, checks it, sets it down, checks flashlight. Then he opens canteen, squats and drinks. Assumption is, it's whiskey. He gargles a little, spits it out, studies the building narrow-eyed. Talks into recorder.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">NEVILLE
</p><p id="dia">You've got to hand it to the bastards. They cover their tracks. It's been a damn year now.

</p><p></p><p id="act">The body, left from plague-time, is not a skeleton, but simply a decayed and desiccated ruin, disgusting and piteous.

</p><p></p><p id="act">It is paneled. drapes, dark furniture, thick carpets, etc. It is very long with a huge ornate desk at the far end. Behind the desk, sitting in a large high-backed swivel chair is a body. Neville studies the figure in the chair for a moment. The figure wears a hood, and it is this which keys Neville’s response. CAMERA DRIFTS DOWN ROOM toward figure. CAMERA now in Neville's POINT OF VIEW. CAMERA GLANCES FROM SIDE TO SIDE as it approaches figure, making sure there are no others lurking in corners. CAMERA STOPS on MED. SHOT, figure in chair, it stirs.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">NEVILLE (O.S.),

</p><p></p><p id="act">SEQUENCE OF SHOTS - NEVILLE RUNNING THROUGH PARK
</p><p></p><p id="act">In none of these shots do we see the girl again. We see Neville running through trees, past a lake or stream; pausing to get his breath ' looking in all directions. He is almost frenzied. It has been almost two years since he has seen a normal human being alive -- much less a lovely girl. As the sequence ends, he is obviously exhausted. The shadows are much longer now. It is afternoon.
</p><p></p><p id="act">MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE SEATED ON BENCH

</p><p></p><p id="act">VERY CLOSE SHOT - BOTTLE OF WINE SLIPPING FROM LISAS HAND
</p><p></p><p id="act">The bottle falls to the pavement, breaks. The red wine soaks the sidewalk.
</p><p></p><p id="act">MED. CLOSE - LISA
</p><p></p><p id="act">This is still a BACK SHOT. She slowly reaches up, pulls off her scarf, tosses away her sunglasses. As her hair Is revealed we SEE It is now almost pure silver (not white, silver). She begins walking toward the street where the Family marches. It is dusk now, almost dark. CAMERA HOLDS as Lisa gets smaller, walking into distance,
</p><p></p><p id="act">MED. SHOT - DOOR IN CORRIDOR
</p><p></p><p id="act">Neville moves INTO FRAME approaching the door slowly, carefully. He stands next to door, out of the way, opening It with his fingertips When it is loose, he kicks It open quickly. Inside it is pitch black. Neville stands in corridor, next to door, back against the wall. He cannot see inside.
</p><p></p><p id="act">CLOSE - NEVILLE
</p><p></p><p id="act">He is sweating now. In the darkness he cannot handle himself as well as in the lights. He swings his penlight inside, looks around quickly. He sees nothing but the table and a few smoking candle stabs on It. He hears a sound, a scuttling, as If someone were tip toeing from one place to another.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Neville palls a concussion grenade out of his satchel, pulls the pin with his teeth, holds it in his left hand. He turns, tosses the grenade into the room and covers his ears. The EXPLOSION is deafening, sounding down the corridors.
</p><p></p><p id="act">SEQUENCE OF FLASH CUTS:
</p><p></p><p id="act">This is very brief - DARKENED HALLWAYS AND CORRIDORS as the booming SOUND of the EXPLOSION moves along them.
</p><p></p><p id="act">MED. CLOSE - NEVILLE

</p><p></p><p id="act">CAMERA ZOOMS IN ON RICHIE dead in judges seat. We SEE Ritchie’s head thrown back, blood still oozing from his mouth, eyes open.
</p><p></p><p id="act">CLOSE SHOT NEVILLES REACTION
</p><p></p><p id="act">His expression is hard, bat it is obvious that the boys death has moved him.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">NEVILLE

</p><p></p><p id="act">MED. SHOT - NEVILLE'S CAR

</p><p></p><p id="act">MED. SHOT - NEVILLE PAUSING TO REST
</p><p></p><p id="act">He stands against the side of a building, breathing deeply. He is weakened by the loss of blood in making serum. Then a spear or arrow STRIKES the bricks next to him. He whirls, shoots.
</p><p></p><p id="act">REVERSE SHOT - CREATURE FALLING
</p><p></p><p id="act">This SHOT is from beyond the creature who has tried to kill Neville. Neville is in far B.G., stun gun aimed at the creature. The creature lies on the pavement, bleeding, twitching. CAMERA HOLDS as Neville begins running again, this time directly TOWARD CAMERA, running over the body of the thing he has killed.
</p><p></p><p id="act">LONG DOWN SHOT - NEVILLE RUNNING
</p><p></p><p id="act">We see him running from VANTAGE POINT above the street. He is about a half-block from the apartment. We see his APT. from this VANTAGE POINT ALSO. We see SEVERAL of the FAMILY in the street running toward Neville. He FIRES, still running. Cuts them down.

As elevator door opens, FOCUS SHIFTS TO DOOR. Neville steps out. CAMERA CLOSES TO CLOSE SHOT. He frowns. Why is the apartment dark, bathed by glow of floodlights and a single candle?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">NEVILLE
</p><p id="dia">Lisa ... Lisa...
</p><p></p><p id="act">Lisa’s voice is strange and distant, and odd quality in It as if it were being heard through water.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">LISA (O.S.)
</p><p id="dia">Yes...Robert...
</p><p></p><p id="act">Neville relaxes, puts down his gun. He walks a step or two toward the SOUND of her VOICE - by the draperies, now pulled to cover the balcony windows.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">NEVILLE

</p><p></p><p id="act">MED. SHOT - SILHOUETTE OF LISA - NEVILLE'S POV
</p><p></p><p id="act">We see her standing, three-quarter-rear view. She is illuminated by very weak, bluish light of outside floods coming through draperies. Her VOICE still has that peculiar mechanical SOUND.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">NEVILLE (O.S.),

It is as if the remote past has come forth to revenge itself on civilization. At the end of the sequence, se SEE some of the FAMILY setting FIRE to the draperies, the books, the kindling left of furniture. One of the creatures begins to SMASH the lenses of the balcony floodlights. During this sequence, Matthias VOICE COMES OVER
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MATTHIAS (O.S.)
</p><p id="dia">We waited for you, Neville. So you could see this the end of everything you’ve done. You see? None of it was real. It was a dream. Your art, your science it was all a nightmare. And now its done. It's finished.
</p><p></p><p id="act">The SHOT SURVEYS ruined apartment, burned books, slashed paintings, wrecked scientific equipment -- the bust of Caesar smashed, deserves a CLOSE SHOT.

</p><p></p><p id="act">As the creatures start to walk toward elevator, he breaks free, dives away from them into what is left of his arsenal section of apartment. He clubs first creature with the butt of a broken rifle, throws it at the next. He grabs up a Pistol, fires point blank at two more. Matthias comes at him, a knife raised. The pistol is empty. Neville dodges Matthias, skirts toward center of room. Matthias following. Neville reaches down, lifts the head of the broken bust of Caesar, throws it at Matthias, knocks him down and out.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">NEVILLE
</p><p id="dia">Lisa...
</p><p></p><p id="act">He grabs her am. She does not respond. He pulls her along he opens the refrigerator takes out the pint bottle of blood and stuffs it into his coveralls. Lisa neither resists, or helps. Neville grabs up the broken rifle.

</p><p></p><p id="act">In the B.G., beyond the lights of the plaza, we see the sky Is beginning to lighten. It is dawn, In the distance the silence is broken by the faint sound of a track motor coming through the streets. Neville makes sure the blood is secure, prepares himself to run. As he bolts forward, he pulls Lisa along with him.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">NEVILLE
</p><p id="dia">Now, Lisa, now!
</p><p></p><p id="act">MED. LONG SHOT - EXT. PLAZA - LISA AND NEVILLE RUNNING
</p><p></p><p id="act">As Neville and Lisa come up out of the garage we SEE the Family beginning to drift away at the edges of the floodlights as the first signs of dawn begin to show. Sound of truck, previously very faint almost sub aural, now becomes a little louder. Neville Is obviously pulling Lisa, while she does not resist him, does not cooperate. They slow down in middle of the Plaza, near the fountain, awaiting truck.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MATTHIAS (O.S.)
</p><p id="dia">Lisa.
</p><p></p><p id="act">His voice is soft, almost caressing. It is the same voice in which he addressed Richie before stabbing him.
</p><p></p><p id="act">MED. CLOSE SHOT - LISA AND NEVILLE
</p><p></p><p id="act">They look back and up--toward balcony of Neville's apartment.
</p><p></p><p id="act">VERY CLOSE SHOT LISA
