Omega Man, The (1971) movie script




FADE IN:


WIDE ANGLE MED. LONG SHOT


WE SEE a palm-lined richly attractive street in a Los Angeles suburb. The houses are set back from the street; the street itself is quiet, empty -- except for a few cars parked in front of the houses. While the camera takes no notice, the tires are down on the parked cars, the lawns of the houses are uncut. A Ford experimental model convertible turns corner INTO VIEW. It drives at a medium speed.


MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE IN CAR - HEAD ON


ROBERT NEVILLE is driving car. He wears sunglasses, a sport shirt, a neckerchief, and looks altogether like a wealthy man out for a drive. CAMERA ALLOWS CAR TO PULL ABREAST, so that SHOT BECOMES SIDE ANGLE. As the CAMERA ENTERS passenger space of the car, we HEAR MUSIC, "Everybody's Out Of Town." Neville hums along with it. He seems at ease, unconcerned. We SEE the houses on his right side passing by. Then his humming stops, his jaw tightens. The car stops with vicious suddenness, and CAMERA PULLS BACK to MED. SHOT, as if aghast at the sight to follow. Neville, in a single motion of astonishing speed, comes up with a stun gun in his right hand, fires directly INTO CAMERA.


REVERSE SHOT - DARKENED BALCONY WINDOW OF HOUSE


CAMERA ZOOMS IN from MED. LONG to MED. CLOSE SHOT of a deeply shadowed window in one of the houses. Bullets smash into the frame of the window, tear out chunks of the stucco. We SEE, barely, a figure fall backward. We cannot see any details of the figure. Its presence is more intuited than seen.


CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S FACE


IN F.G. is Neville’s stun gun, almost obscuring his features. FREEZE-FRAME.

PROCESS SHOT - MISSILES EXPLODING


Color of explosions should be geared to the color of water in the plaza fountain, which is perhaps illuminated by CAMERA orange and red and yellow spots under the water. IMAGE BLURS at explosion.


CAMERA MOVES DOWNWARD from explosion, picking up earth far below, keeps going down more and more rapidly, finally BLURRING In speed.


VERY HIGH SHOT - SHOPPING CENTER

Neville grimaces, shakes his head. At the end of next speech PHONE RINGS.

CLOSE SHOT - TIRE GOING FLAT


MED. SHOT - NEVILLE GETTING OUT OF CAR


He is irritated, looks around as if seeking a filling station attendant in order to get tire fixed. Glances down. He has run over a broken steel box, with US Mint markings. Its torn hinges have shredded the tire, and the gold ingots it contained are scattered under the wheels. He glances across street. A Brink's truck sits crashed into a fire hydrant, its rear doors open, swinging useless in breeze. Mint boxes and gold bullion lying unguarded.


MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE


His expression is one of total disgust. He speaks sardonically.


          NEVILLE
Why don't they keep the goddamn street clean.


MED. SHOT - NEVILLE


He unloads car, hangs gun over his back, puts a few grenades in his belt, lifts gas can. As he walks away from car, he muses.


          NEVILLE
There was a Mercedes agency on Sunset. Or was it Wilshire?


MED. LONG SHOT - NEVILLE WALKING


Ahead is the agency. Windows are broken. A 230SL convertible sits in the showroom. Neville walks through the broken window, walks around car.


          NEVILLE
The color's not right, but ... how long did you say it takes to get a new one from Germany...?

A long DOWN SHOT, which shows the car reaching speeds of over a hundred miles an hour.


CUT TO:

CUT TO:


WIDE ANGLE LONG SHOT - NEVILLE IN CAR

Tires squeal as Neville turns corner. CAMERA MOVES OUT TO MEDIUM SHOT as car rights itself and shoots away.


MED. SHOT - NEVILLE IN CAR


The car lights are on now, and as Neville slows down, it is deep twilight. He turns into drive in front of a tall apartment building. CAMERA MOVES IN TO MED. CLOSE SHOT of Neville in car. He presses remote-control button and WE SEE garage door open ahead of him. CAMERA SWIEEPS to Neville's face. He shows relief, as if he has made, It through a very tough race indeed.


MED. SHOT - DOWN ANGLE FROM BEHIND CAR


As Neville guns motor and starts into garage, a figure detaches itself from growing darkness and leaps onto him. The figure seems simply to materialize) and it leaps high, landing almost in the car. Neville tries to fight back as the car drifts down the drive into garage.


MED. SHOT - INT. GARAGE


from within the garage. WE SEE the car drifting down the ramp into garage, Neville and the black-clad figure wrestle as the car, at low speed, crashes into a pillar or another car. Neville pushes the black figure away, hits him, hits him again, jumps from the car with his stun gun and fires a burst into the black figure. CAMERA RUSHES IN FOR CLOSE SHOT OF NEVILLE as he turns from the fallen figure. He looks outward at the still-open garage door, his face reflecting fear, horror.


REVERSE SHOT - GARAGE DOOR AREA


Two more black-clad figures are rushing in armed with clubs or spears.


CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE


CAMERA JERKS as Neville fires his stun gun directly into LENS. Above the gun, his face is clenched in hatred, loathing.


MED. SHOT - GARAGE DOOR AREA


The door is lowering now. There is a body lying in a dark heap-just inside. WE can SEE one or two others scurrying away outside in the dark as the door closes4


MED. SHOT - NEVILLE


He has lowered his gun, holds the remote-control box, pressing the button to lower the door. He is exhausted, shoulders slumped. He walks through the garage stopping to check a large gasoline-powered generator that has been jury-rigged to a panel to distribute current. There are shelves full of oil and batteries and similar supplies. He walks through the low-lighted garage. There are several rows of bright automobiles, sports cars, jeeps, a few pick-up trucks, a single armored car. All are kept in good condition, brightly polished.


Neville walks back out into the open area of the garage, surveying the damage to the Mercedes, shaking his head.


          NEVILLE
That's a shame. So hard to get a repairman these days, too.


MED. SHOT - NEVILLE AT ELEVATOR


Neville unlocks an elevator, gets in and pushes the button for the top floor.


          NEVILLE
Penthouse, Robert. He's probably anxious to get on with the game.


He leans back against the side of the elevator, eyes closed, exhausted, but still on the verge of laughter.


          NEVILLE
Some game...


CUT TO:


LONG SHOT - ELEVATOR DOOR OPENING - NEVILLE


The elevator opens directly into penthouse. Neville coming OUT into his fortress-apartment. In left F.G. of SHOT is silhouette of profile of what appears to be a man in a military--cap. Neville drops stun gun slowly to the floor, looks around room, his eyes light on figure.


          NEVILLE
Okay, Okay, I’m ready.


CAMERA MOVES PAST SILHOUETTE, MOVES ACROSS LARGE ORNATE CHESSBOARD in middle F.G. to MED. SHOT on Neville-. He pulls off dirty shirt, tosses it aside, walks to his left. CAMERA STAYS ON HIM.


          NEVILLE
Go ahead ... move.


Neville walks into what seems another world, as CAMERA TURNS to FOLLOW HIM. It is a very long gallery-like room with many mahogany bookcases, walls covered with major paintings, pieces of sculpture here and there. He walks to a beautiful and ornate bar-liquor-cabinet, takes down a bottle of fine scotch. He pauses and studies the label as he twists off the cap. He speaks back over his shoulder.


          NEVILLE
Why don’t you have a belt? It might improve your game.


He takes a long pull from the bottle, then moves on to the far end of the room where we can SEE a beautiful bed, armoire, old fashioned wash-basin, mirror, etc. These are perhaps screened off from the rest of the long gallery area by some bookcases set at right angles to the wall, forming a small chamber behind. CAMERA STAYS at ENTRANCE to SMALL CHAMBER. Neville rummages for a clean shirt, slips it on.


          NEVILLE
But tonight you're going to lose. Luck over skill...


CAMERA MOVES IN QUICKLY FOR CLOSE SHOT showing that beneath is sardonic humor, Neville’s loneliness and isolation tell on him.


MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE


He still carries glass, and is rummaging again, this time in a storage cabinet. It is white, antiseptic, very large. It contains a multitude of canned goods. Neville gets out a can of beans. He moves to stainless steel refrigerator, also large, gets out a summer sausage, and ice cubes and a chilled glass for scotch.


          NEVILLE
You hear all that downstairs? I let sundown catch me out. So he took the gambit and threw away a few pawns. I was lucky...


Neville opens can, cuts casing off one end of sausage. CAMERA moves OUT to MED. SHOT, showing this opposite end of apartment. It is as stark, barren and utilitarian as the other end is cultivated and civilized. In it are kitchen facilities, laboratory equipment, and a massive arsenal. (See Appendix for more on apartment)


          NEVILLE
From time to time he gets nervous. He smells the end game coming...


Neville is looking toward center of room as he talks. CAMERA MOVES BACK so as to place chessboard once more in middle F.G.


Neville is walking toward board, scotch bottle and glass In one hand, beans (with spoon in can) in other. Summer sausage Is slang across his shoulder, held by string looped over finger of hand holding beans. He saunters to board, looks down studying situation. We now have time to SEE that the board, and its pieces, are both large and superb: a museum-quality set.


          NEVILLE
But end games are fall of surprises, aren’t they? Ummm. My move, and discovered ... check!


He puts down beans and sausage on edge of table, and moves knight, revealing check from his queen on opponent's king. Neville smiles and sits down.


MED. SHOT - ACROSS BOARD - NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW


We find that his partner is a bust of Caesar propped in the chair with an old and badly battered garrison cap on it. Cap bears eagle Insignia of colonel. CAMERA MOVES TO TWO SHOT. Neville studies board, absently presses a switch located under the table. After a moment, we HEAR MUSIC. It is Frankie Laine singing "We'll Be Together Again."


          RECORD
No tears, no fears, we both have a lifetime before us... So what if we have to part, we'll be together again...


Neville hits reject switch. Another tune, instrumental COMES ON. "Harlem Nocturne," Ted Heath's orchestra; alto sax solo.


MED. SHOT -NEVILLE AT CHESS BOARD


Neville makes a move on board. As he does, we HEAR NOISE, COMMOTION outside. Breaking glass, yells. Neville stands, studying board Intently. As the noise INCREASES, CAMERA MOVES to CLOSE SHOT of his FACE. His jaw tightens at he tries to Ignore the SOUNDS.


          ZACHARY (O.S.)
Come out, Neville


Neville sighs, smiles at bust.


          NEVILLE
Excuse me, won't you. Just for a moment.


He walks quietly to window, reaches down and picks up a Springfield 1903 rifle with a Sniperscope attached. He steps to the window. The windows are full-length and open onto a narrow balcony. All along the balcony rail, spaced every thirty feet or so, are floodlights pointed down into plaza in front of building. Neville has knocked out partitions between portions of balcony so as to have access to flood lights all along building. Down below In plaza or courtyard, there Is a large and brightly illuminated fountain, water bubbling In it, cascading from level to another. Neville stares out over darkened city. In far distance, perhaps a mile away, we SEE a fire start up, blaze higher.


REVERSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S SILHOUETTE IN WINDOW


          NEVILLE
They're at It again. Burning, wrecking. I wonder what tonight? A library? A laboratory? Maybe they've found the Museum of Fine Art. Goddamn those crazy bastards...


MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE AT WINDOW


He raises the rifle.


LONG SHOT - INFRA-RED TELESCOPIC SHOT


PANNING weird and unreal area outside range of floodlights. Passes a hunched, squatting figure. Stops, moves back Crosshairs glow as sight is given fine adjustment. IMAGE RECOILS as we HEAR REPEAT OF RIFLE. Figure slumps. MORE NOISE, CONFUSION, CRIES.


MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE


SHOT is across chessboard, through pieces from busts POINT OF VIEW. Neville is grinning sardonically. He raises the rifle in salute.


          NEVILLE
Hall Caesar! And what do you suppose Brother Matthias is going to say about that?


CUT TO:


MED. LONG BOOM SHOT - NEVILLE AT TABLE


SHOT is from outside window. CAMERA IMMEDIATELY PULLS BACK farther and farther until we SEE Neville's penthouse, a circle of brilliant light in an ocean of surrounding darkened buildings, no street lights. CAMERA HOLDS when penthouse is only a small glimmer of light. (Matte)


DISSOLVE TO:


CLOSE SHOT - FIRE IN FOG.


Fire flickers as CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal that it Is made 'up of burning books. CAMERA PANS titles: Molecular Biology, Astrophysics, etc. In B.G. we see many members of the Family systematically wrecking scientific and computer equipment.


          MATTHIAS (O.S.)
Three? You're sure? Not three.


          ZACHARY (O.S.)
Three, Brother. Two were inside the garage when he brought down the door, We heard the shooting. Then Joshua...


CAMERA TURNS RIGHT, bringing Matthias INTO FRAME, CLOSE SHOT, head and shoulders. Matthias has dead-white hair, complexion, wears enormous sunglasses with reflecting lenses.


          MATTHIAS
The light, you have to stay clear of the light...


CAMERA PULLS BACK, revealing Zachary. He Is like Matthias, white with sunglasses. But his hair Is natural and his features clearly African. Zachary speaks defensively.


          ZACHARY
Brother, there wasn't no light... That cat hit Joshua in pitch black...


          MATTHIAS
He cant see in the dark-...anymore than we can In the light.


Zachary shrugs.


          ZACHARY
Go tell him. Brother. He sees good enough, dark or light.


Matthias walks in the glare of flames, wrecking continues In B.G. His dialogue is delivered sadly, reasonably at first.


          MATTHIAS
One creature... caught in a place he can't stir from in the dark. One lone man...


          ZACHARY
He ain't a man, Brother.


          MATTHIAS
No, no, you're right. But he is alone, outnumbered hundreds to one, with nothing to live for but memories ...nothing to live with but his gimmicks and gadgetry, his guns and ears...and yet the whole Family cant bring him down out of that...that...


          ZACHARY
Pig-paradise, Brother?


MED. CLOSE TWO SHOT - MATTHIAS AND ZACHARY


Matthias smiles sadly.


          MATTHIAS
Forget the old ways, Brother, the old hatreds, the old pains. The Family is one...


Zachary nods, matching Matthias grin.


          ZACHARY
Hog heaven, then...


But Matthias is getting worked up.


          MATTHIAS
Its not a joke, Brother. Remember the word! That thing, that Neville, is a creature of the wheel! He uses forbidden weapons, to6.ls! He has the power of Hell In those evil things!


CLOSE SHOT - ZACHARY


He is agitated, tired of hearing this. He has told them before that he can bring Neville down. He tries again.


          ZACHARY
Well, let me put the power on him. Look...


CAMERA FOLLOWS his pointing finger. In a glass-fronted refrigeration unit are flasks of nitroglycerin. CAMERA SNAPS BACK to ZACHARY.


          ZACHARY
...or there's cannons. I can go to the old Guard armory. I could get a rocket-launcher ... Just turn me loose...


MED. SHOT - GROUP - MATTHIAS AND FAMILY


We SEE that a group of five or six others who are like Matthias have gathered around while others continue destruction in B.G. The group mumble amongst themselves, shake their heads. Matthias answers him, as if he were explaining to a child.


          MATTHIAS
Oh, yes, Brother, you could do that. Any one of us could. But if we did, the curse would begin once more, don't you see that?


CLOSE SHOT - ZACHARY


Zachary is sullen.


          ZACHARY
I see that bastard living In the light like God whilst we rot and hide down here like grubs ... What do you reckon will happen if he hunts as out while We sleep?


MED. GROUP SHOT MATTHIAS, ZACHARY, OTHERS


          MATTHIAS
Put it out of mind, Brother. He will be destroyed. But not by guns and explosives. They are forbidden. They are never to be used again. When we have cleansed the word the flood of our righteousness will sweep it all away...


As Matthias speaks he picks up a book and hurls it toward the fire, knocking elaborate glass structure down.


          MATTHIAS
And Neville will be brought down... down to the Family and judgment. For blasphemy, for murder...


As he speaks SLOW DISSOLVE from fire, grown larger now, engulfing whole building behind, to brightly lit top story of Neville's apartment.'


VERY LONG SHOT TOP STORY OF NEVILLE'S APARTMENT


FADE OUT


FADE IN:


MED. LONG SHOT - EMPTY STREET, EARLY MORNING


The street is one of those with many apartment-hotels, etc., as on portions of Wilshire Blvd. SHOT is through trees, grass is tall in the-lawns, etc. We HEAR NOTHING at first but BIRDS. Then we HEAR the SOUND of someone RUNNING. CAMERA TURNS, finds a LONE FIGURE RUNNING TOWARD IT. SHOT. should be made INTO RISING SUN, sun rays refracted and diffused around dark silhouette of figure.


MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE RUNNING


He is in sweat suit, the shirt has JOHNS HOPKINS in large letters on front, his stun gun is on sling over shoulder, canteen and pouches in utility belt at waist. Flashlight, knife, etc. There is also a small tape recorder hung on belt. Neville continues to run, looking from time to time at numbers on buildings. At last he stops in front of a building, inspects it. He is breathing hard.


          NEVILLE
...And Big Bob Neville shakes off the last of the tacklers and scores with fifty thousand fans tearing up the stands... Another six for Hopkins...yea. Neville.


He squats, pulls map from pouch, studies it, speaks into small tape-mike. CAMERA MOVES OUT FOR MED. LONG SHOT OF NEVILLE, down ANGLE from building POINT OF VIEW.


          NEVILLE
This is 6306 Rimini Boulevard, sector two. The last six blocks have been clean. In the 5500 block, some signs they'd been foraging for food in a small drive-in grocery.
(sardonically)
You'd think prices would keep them in the super markets.


MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE


He unlimbers stun gun, checks it, sets it down, checks flashlight. Then he opens canteen, squats and drinks. Assumption is, it's whiskey. He gargles a little, spits it out, studies the building narrow-eyed. Talks into recorder.


          NEVILLE
You've got to hand it to the bastards. They cover their tracks. It's been a damn year now.


Drinks again, lets mike-hang, eyes distant in thoughts


          NEVILLE
If I could find the nest, find where he stays there’d be an end-run, and an end game, sure enough...


He gets up, closes canteen, picks up equipment.


          NEVILLE
But what would I do then...?

Dark, dusty, light falling through half-closed blind. SHOT is ACROSS BED. Neville kicks open door, sees bed. There is someone or something apparently in it. Neville jerks back sheet, stun gun ready.


CLOSE SHOT - CORPSE IN BED


The body, left from plague-time, is not a skeleton, but simply a decayed and desiccated ruin, disgusting and piteous.

Door is large, paneled. Obviously the entrance to very plush executive office. Neville puts ear against door, listens, stands back, kicks door open.


LONG SHOT - OFFICE - PAST NEVILLETS SHOULDER


It is paneled. drapes, dark furniture, thick carpets, etc. It is very long with a huge ornate desk at the far end. Behind the desk, sitting in a large high-backed swivel chair is a body. Neville studies the figure in the chair for a moment. The figure wears a hood, and it is this which keys Neville’s response. CAMERA DRIFTS DOWN ROOM toward figure. CAMERA now in Neville's POINT OF VIEW. CAMERA GLANCES FROM SIDE TO SIDE as it approaches figure, making sure there are no others lurking in corners. CAMERA STOPS on MED. SHOT, figure in chair, it stirs.


          NEVILLE (O.S.),
All right, Dracula. Wake up. You've got company.


Figure does not move. WE SEE BARREL of stun gun poked toward him from BOTTOM OF FRAME.


We cannot see eyes of figure.


          NEVILLE (O.S.),
Where's Matthias? Where does he stay?


Figure does not move.


MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE He shrugs, sighs.

As Neville finishes speech, he pokes figure with barrel of gun. It falls forward, hood coming off. It Is dead and Disintegrating. SHOT HOLDS. We HEAR Neville's VOICE into tape recorder.


          NEVILLE (O.S.),
6806 Rimini Boulevard, sector two. Found another. Matthias' crowd is dying from the plague, one by one. Sweep continues.


DISSOLVE TO:


FADE IN:


LONG SHOT - NEVILLE WALKING ALONG STREET


He walks, one hand in pocket, a stun gun In the other, window-shopping. Some of the windows in the stores are broken. Behind others, the displays are askew, dusty. A liquor store Is almost demolished. He reaches an expensive looking clothing store, pauses, walks inside. Dialogue Is VOICE OVER. He palls off sweatshirt, drops it on floor.


          NEVILLE
You dumb bastard, why did you ever bother to wash these things? You’re the only consumer left in town.


CUT TO:


MED. SHOT - NEVILLE IN MENIS CLOTHING DEPARTMENT


He takes a garment from the rack, looks at it, drops it then frowns, picks it up and re-hangs it on the rack. He draws out a beautiful brocade tuxedo jacket, turns it, smiles, hangs it back.


          NEVILLE
The Officers club is closed, isn't it?


Permanent undress is the correct uniform.


CUT TO:


LONG SHOT - NEVILLE WALKING THROUGH DARKENED STORE


Away from windows, it is shadowy in-the store, and we watch Neville walking, some clothes over his arm. SHOT is PAST HEAD AND SHOULDER OF A MANNIKIN.


CUT TO:


LONG SHOT - THE SAME - ANOTHER ANGLE


Again POINT OF VIEW of a manikin -- as if those inert figures are watching Neville's progress past them. He seems unconcerned, but his stun gun is in his right hand.


MED. LONG SHOT - ANOTHER ANGLE


THIS SHOT is from between the upraised arms of a manikin.


CLOSE SHOT - FACE OF MALE MANIKIN


CLOSE SHOT - ANOTHER MANIKIN


CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S FACE


He has stopped in relatively light portion of store. He is looking up, face filled almost with reverence.


MED. UP ANGLE SHOT - FEMALE MANIKIN


This manikin wears a very brief bikini. She is remarkably life-like. Her hips jut forward provocatively, her eyes point down toward Neville, and her long brown hair falls about her tanned shoulders. She wears the smallest of smiles.


MED. SHOT - NEVILLE LOOKING UP AT MANIKIN


This SHOT is past the head and shoulder of another manikin across the aisle from where Neville stands.


It is as if his moment of passion and remembrance is overseen.


MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE - SIDE VIEW


He is I still looking upward. He puts out his hand to touch the almost-flesh of the manikin. Then, suddenly, there


Is a small indefinite SOUND. He pauses, his jaw tightens. CAMERA RUSHES BACK TO MED. LONG SHOT


as Neville whirls, stun gun up, clothing dropped. He is about to fire.


MED. SHOT - GROUP OF MANNIKINS AND LISA


These are female manikins including some with Negro features, In various dress, various poses. CAMERA FINDS LISA AMONG THEM, MOVES IN SUDDENLY TO MED. CLOSE SHOT.  WE SEE the "manikins" mouth open In horror.


MED. LONG SHOT - NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW - LISA


Lisa turns suddenly and vanishes into the shadows of the store.


CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE


He is petrified. He cannot believe what he has seen. The gun hangs useless in his hand.


He stands thus for a long moment, then, finding his voice, he calls after her.


          NEVILLE
Wait...come back...wait... You’re real! You’re not...


LONG SHOT - NEVILLE RUNNING THROUGH STORE


Again, this SHOT is through a group of male manikins, well dressed, grinning at Neville as he runs.


MED. LONG SHOT - ANOTHER ANGLE - NEVILLE RUNNING


He gets another glimpse of the girl as she runs out a side door of the store.


MED. SHOT EXT. STORE


This store is across the street from a large park. Neville pauses outside the store, looking up and down. CAMERA RUSHES BACK TO VERY LONG SHOT, still focused on Neville. When CAMERA STOPS, the SHOT is FRAMED by the girl's hair and one shoulder. We do not see her face, but we can tell she is looking back at Neville from within the park. CAMERA ZOOMS IN on Neville again as he sees the girl. He begins running across the deserted street toward her.


SEQUENCE OF SHOTS - NEVILLE RUNNING THROUGH PARK


In none of these shots do we see the girl again. We see Neville running through trees, past a lake or stream; pausing to get his breath ' looking in all directions. He is almost frenzied. It has been almost two years since he has seen a normal human being alive -- much less a lovely girl. As the sequence ends, he is obviously exhausted. The shadows are much longer now. It is afternoon.


MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE SEATED ON BENCH


He sits, head down, his gun beside him. He is beginning to wonder if he has hallucinated the girl, if at last he is slipping toward insanity.


          NEVILLE
Does it begin this way? Is two years alone too much?


Then his head comes up. He has control again.


          NEVILLE
No. you silly bastard, it doesn't begin this way, and two years alone is all right. The way it begins is asking yourself idiot questions. Now, let's find a drink before it's time to go home.


He stands up, stretches, looks refreshed.


DISSOLVE TO:


CLOSE SHOT - CANDLE GUTTERING IN HOLDER


CAMERA PULLS BACK, showing Neville in bar mirror. He drinks from glass, pours a little more from bottle, turns from-the bar. The room Is dark, light coming only from candle and from windows at front. The door is open. Neville, stun gun in left hand, drink in right, walks through tables, stands at door. Across the street is a federal court building. His eyes go up its height as CAMERA TURNS for LONG SHOT of BUILDING, Neville In RIGHT SIDE of FRAME.


MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE BACK INSIDE


He puts down empty glass, starts to pick 'up his equipment. Suddenly pauses as he HEARS a CRASH from a breaking bottle. His jaw tightens, he becomes tense and turns toward sound.


CLOSE SHOT - WINE KEG DISPLAY


Sign reads "Visit Our Wine Cellar -- For the Experience of a Lifetime"


MED. SHOT - NEVILLE


He squints at sigh, heads for the stairway with candle.


MED, SHOT - NEVILLE GOING DOWN STAIRS WITH CANDLE


MED. LONG SHOT - NEVILLE IN CELLAR


This should be a spooky and generally tense atmosphere. The cellar, like much contemporary commercial architecture is made to look like an "authentic" wine cellar, and two years' dust and cobwebs have improved on art. SHOT is from BEHIND wine rack, over bottles, showing Neville at foot of steps, looking about cautiously. He puts candle on hogshead for general lighting, pulls out flashlight to examine


MED. REVERSE SHOT - WINE RACKS, NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW


MED. LONG DOWN SHOT - NEVILLE LOOKING AT WINE RACKS


His flashlight probes here and there along walls. Stops on a. particular area of one of the racks.


VERY CLOSE SHOT SIDE VIEW OF WINE BOTTLES IN RACK


Neville's light falls on bottle. Behind rack we SEE another HAND at back. CAMERA HOLDS. The hand is still when light first strikes it, then it comes to life, moves, clenches.


MEDIUM SHOT - BEHIND RACK OF BOTTLES


We SEE a FAMILY MEMBER who has apparently been sleeping in cellar and has knocked wine bottle over in sleep. He comes awake fully as Neville enters cellar.


NEVILLE - CLOSE SHOT


From the shadows to his left rear. Also made from behind wine rack. CAMERA RISES from near floor level to five feet or so, following POINT OF VIEW of Family member.


MED. WIDE ANGLE SHOT - WINE RACK


From behind Neville. As he approaches rack, the entire Rack tilts and slowly falls toward him.


MED. SHOT - NEVILLE


throws himself back, trying to avoid the rack, but as he does so, he looks up.


MED. CLOSE SHOT - UP ANGLE - CREATURE ON TOP OF WINE RACK


hood flaring behind, arms outstretched


CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S REACTION


MED. SHOT - RACK FALLING ON NEVILLE


bottles falling out of rack and exploding on floor. Creature jumps free from top of rack,


MED. LONG SHOT - DOWN ANGLE FROM STAIRS


Three more of the creatures pile-out from behind barrels, wine racks, wherever they've been sleeping.


MED. SHOT NEVILLE UNCONSCIOUS UNDER WINE RACK


CLOSE SHOT CREATURE'S FACE


Shook as CAMERA SNAPS IN for very CLOSE SHOT: dead white face, Its mouth open, twisted with


hatred and anger, eyes still obscured by hood.


FADE OUT.


SLOW FADE IN:


As light begins to fill the SCREEN again, BLURRY, without FOCUS, WE HEAR, as from a great distance, TINY in sound, the VOICE of Matthias once more. He is preaching in away not much different from his last TV appearance in the credit montage. His voice has a peculiar mixture of the comforting and the sinister in it. As he goes on, his voice RISES, moves toward HYSTERIA.


          MATTHIAS
...and, oh, brothers and sisters, I ask you to look at him. Does he have the Marks? Do you see them?
(muffled answers of "no, no.")
You see him as we were before the Punishment, before we gained grace. You see lying there, the last of scientists and bankers and business- men...the users of the wheel! Do we use the tools of the wheel, as he does?
("no, not.")
Is he of The Family?
("no, not")
Is he of the Sacred Society?
(no, not.")
Then ... what is he?
(confused mumbling, anger)


CAMERA CLEARS VERY SLOWLY TO AN UP SHOT NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW


WE SEE the vague image of someone in robes in a high pulpit, behind a high bench. CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY, APPEARING TO SEEK FOCUS. THEN IT SNAPS INTO FOCUS IN ZOOM - VERY CLOSE SHOT of large reflective sunglasses. It is Matthias. His hood is pushed back, and the rooms illumination is quite low.


He seems to float in the darkness with candle-flames flickering around and behind him.


LONG DOWN SHOT - NEVILLE TIED ON FLOOR MATTHIAS POINT OF VIEW


Neville is regaining consciousness. CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY DOWN on him as Matthias talks.


          MATTHIAS (O.S.)
He is part of the dead...he has no place here. He has the stink of oil and electric circuitry about him. He is obsolete...
( ...yes, yes.")


WIDE ANGIE SHOT CHAMBER IN FEDERAL COURT BUILDING


Its former function should still be evident, but it-now serves as the place where the Sacred Society governs the Family. It is courtroom, meetinghouse, church of the group. It is dark, hung with black cloth. The room is full of the hooded creatures that we have seen before. Only Matthias and perhaps half a dozen of his immediate followers do not wear hoods. Their hair and skin is dead white, their eyes are covered by an assortment of shields.


          MATTHIAS
And what shall we do with old machinery...?


ZOOM CLOSE SHOT - MATTHIAS - NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW


He points at Neville.


          MATTHIAS
... you are discarded. You are the rubbish of the past...


MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE


His initial horror and fear past, he LAUGHS aloud.


          NEVILLE
This is a bloody Halloween party...


You’re all sick ... You need...


Those nearest, knock him back down, silence him.


MED. SHOT - MATTHIAS


He smiles, shakes his head. His voice becomes soft with false compassion. He leans down over his pulpit.


          MATTHIAS
How hard it is to admit the truth.
(beat)
Take him to the little room. For the Questioning...


MED. SHOT - CREATURES DRAGGING NEVILLE CAMERA FOLLOWS as they take Neville into a smaller room.


MED. LONG SHOT - THE LITTLE ROOM - MATTHIAS AND NEVILLE


This room resembles the small chambers in which private questioning took place during the Inquisition. The table is long and there are candles and books on it. The scene should be Gothic and just this side of a put-on. Taste here, as elsewhere, must be exquisite so as to tread the line between the grotesque, the demented, and the Camp.


          MATTHIAS
Well, now, Mr. Neville, we can talk for a little while. It's been a long time since you've talked -- except to yourself.


CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S REACTION


Neville is surprised. He has assumed Matthias was truly and completely insane.


          NEVILLE
So you don’t rant all the time? Why bother with it at all?


MED. SHOT - MATTHIAS


He LAUGHS, walks around the dark room.


          MATTHIAS
Yes, you were a scientist. The kind of man who understood nothing until there was almost nothing left to understand.


          NEVILLE
(surly)
I'm getting along...


          MATTHIAS
You're getting dead, Mr. Neville -- or doctor or colonel, whatever they called you. I have responsibility for the last tiny remnant of mankind ... I have that responsibility.


          NEVILLE
Then why the hell don’t you live up to it? Why don't you throw away the costumes and get these people organized, try to work on a cure...


Matthias turns on him angrily.


          MATTHIAS
Oh. we are organized. You know that well enough. A cure? There is none. In the early days ... Have you seen the ruins of the general hospital? Thousands of bodies littering the corridors, rooms jammed with the dead ... and finally... those pitiful few who were left, hopeless, going mad, lynching the doctors, the technicians who had betrayed them... By the way, why weren't you there... Doctor?


REACTION SHOT - NEVILLE


          NEVILLE
I tried. There was a crash...


TWO SHOT - MATTHIAS AND NEVILLE,


          MATTHIAS
It doesn't matter. There was no cure. Is none. The curse you people created, couldn't stop, is... forever. So I've turned that curse into a blessing.


CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S REACTION


          MATTHIAS (O.S.)
No. now the Family has found its way. It can bear the burden -- the only curse left is -- you.


          NEVILLE
You are insane. And before very damn long, you’ll be dead -- can't you see that?


CLOSE SHOT - MATTHIAS


          MATTHIAS
(angrily)
last night you killed how many? Three of us? And today We don't know yet. And before that? You've killed dozens...You’re the messenger of death, Doctor, not us.


TWO SHOT - NEVILLE AND MATTHIAS


OTHERS come INTO the room now, and Matthias manner changes. Once again he adopts the portentous pose of judge-prophet.


          NEVILLE
I was defending myself ... You lunatics came after me...


          MATTHIAS
He's confessed all, Brothers. Murder, use of forbidden tools, practice of proscribed rites. He admits 'science, medicine, weapons, machines, electricity. He has not shared the Punishment; he does not bear the Marks...


CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE


          NEVILLE
What is the Punishment? The Marks?


WIDE ANGLE GROUP SHOT - MATTHIAS AND GROUP OF FAMILY


As Neville speaks, the group stares at him. This is the first group appearance of the Family. WE SEE that they are of both sexes and all races. Some seem fairly young, however there are no children. In addition to the hoods, we find some wearing goggles, some helmets with dark visors, etc. Obviously, all these forms of eye guards have been scavenged in the empty city.


SERIES OF CLOSE SHOTS - INDIVIDUAL FAMILY MEMBERS


As CAMERA PANS from one to another, each removes his or her glasses, goggles, etc. revealing blank white eyes. CAMERA completes pan, stops on Matthias. He removes glasses, shows his own white eyes. For the first time, WE SEE the OPAQUE EYES of the Family.


          MATTHIAS
(quietly)
These are the Marks, Mr. Neville ... The Punishment is what you and those like you brought upon us...


CAMERA CLOSES on Matthias, closes slowly on his face, eyes, as he talks.


          MATTHIAS
In the beginning, we tried to help one another, those that were left. We tried to clean things up, set them straight. We buried and burned. And it came to us that we were spared for just that work...


PAN SHOT - FAMILY MEMBERS LISTENING TO MATTHIAS


          MATTHIAS (O.S.)
... to bury what was dead, to burn what was evil, dangerous...


Neville's VOICE breaks in harsh, angry.


          NEVILLE (O.S.),
So you burned libraries, laboratories...You wrecked computer centers, engineering facilities ... a herd of insane barbarians. Every night you go on burning.


PAN SHOT ENDS ON MATTHIAS. He still speaks very quietly.


          MATTHIAS
You call us barbarians, Neville'. Very well, it's an honorable name. We mean to cancel the world you made. We will simply erase history from the time that machinery and weapons began to threaten more than they offered.


CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE


          NEVILLE
You'll play hell...


CLOSE SHOT - MATTHIAS


          MATTHIAS
No, you've played hell you and your dead kinsmen of the car and the plane and the tank and the bomb ... and when you die, the-last living reminder of hell will be gone ... forever.


As he speaks, CAMERA PULLS OUT TO GROUP SHOT. The Family RS assent.


Matthias turns to Zachary.


          MATTHIAS
Brother Zachary?


          ZACHARY
We got everything ready.


MED. SHOT - EXT. - NEVILLE, MATTHIAS, ETC.


An alley or narrow street. There, a cart has been brought. It has high sides and two solid wooden wheels about five feet in diameter. It is filled with old newspapers, books, files, broken pieces of wooden furniture, etc. SHOT is made BETWEEN Neville and Matthias. Matthias and Family have glasses or shields back on. Zachary comes over, jerks Neville roughly toward cart. Matthias stops him.


          MATTHIAS
One thing, Neville, now that its over...


Neville stares back at him.


          MATTHIAS
why didn't you leave? Why didn't you get out of the city...?


          NEVILLE
I wasn’t sure about that ... until now.


MED. LONG SHOT - NEVILLE IN CART


On his head is a conical cap obviously made of computer printout paper. This scene echoes the burning of heretics. Again, if it is done tastefully, it will gather still another fragment of the past which haunts us. Neville is bound in the small cart. It is pulled by members of the Family. HOWLING members of the Family throw rubbish at him -- scientific debris -- and curse him. The cart is in the midst of a dense crowd, each member of which carries a candle. The lighting is weak, bizarre.


CLOSE SHOT OF OLD WOMAN in hood, eyes opaque, LAUGHING insanely, throwing objects at Neville.


CLOSE SHOT - HANDS


trying to reach through the slats of the cart to scratch Neville. They are dead white.


MED. CLOSE - NEVILLE


over a wave of candles, the flames flickering Insanely.


LONG SHOT - THE CROWD


filling a narrow street from Neville's POINT OF VIEW.


CAMERA TRANSITION TO NEVILLE


who stands tied to the cart, wood and paper and books piled around him. CAMERA PULLS BACK to WIDE ANGLE LONG SHOT. We find that we are in a VAST EMPTY STADIUM. In the midst of the field, THE FAMILY, all


carrying candles, are gathered around the stand from which Matthias preaches. The cart has been turned upside-down


and the technological debris it contained is piled below one of the wheels, to which Neville Is bound, spread-eagled. It stands in a large circular burned area. This is where Matthias and the Family have burned bodies after the plague's onslaught.


MED. LONG SHOT - MATTHIAS - NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW


          MATTHIAS
Here Is evil...


MATTHIAS past Neville's profile. As Matthias speaks, CAMERA FOCUS ALTERS FROM MATTHIAS to NEVILLE.


          MATTHIAS
Is this not the place where all the dead burned? And this
(pointing to Neville)
Is the last of the dead...And what will we do with this corpse?


As Matthias asks his question and the Family HOWLS for Neville’s death, CAMERA PULLS OUT VERY QUICKLY TO WIVZ ANGLE LONG SHOT as stadium LIGHTS COME 0N. At first flickeringly, then with a BURST of fall power. All the lights do not come on. Some bulbs ate burnt out or have failed over the past year or so, but still the field la flooded with light.


MED. SHOT - MATTHIAS AND OTHERS OF THE SOCIETY falling back from their stand, trying to cover their eyes despite their sunglasses.


          MATTHIAS
(surprised)
What...?


NED. LONG - CROWD SCENE


Family members dropping their candles, falling, groping, trying to find a way out of the blazing arc lights.


CLOSE SHOT - FAMILY MEMBER


writhing on ground in agony.


          MATTHIAS (O.S.)
Find the switch, get those lights off...! Give us the darkness again! More dark ... more dark!


NED. CLOSE - FAMILY MEMBER


stumbling blindly toward sidelines of stadium.


NED. CLOSE - FAMILY MEMBER


trying to stab Neville, missing him In his blindness.


WIDE ANGLE LONG SHOT - STADIUM


Neville still staked out in center of stadium. Last of the creatures Is crawling or hobbling away out of the light. After a long moment the are-lights begin to fade, wink, and finally go out. CAMERA ZOOMS DOWN TO CLOSE SHOT of Neville struggling, trying to get loose. Then he pauses, fear in his expression, He HEARS someone COMING.


NED. SHOT - BLURRED IMAGE OF SOMEONE MOVING ACROSS FIELD


walking swiftly across the empty field, Neville tries to twist his head around to see, but it is too dark down in the bowl of the stadium to see more than a shadowy figure.


CLOSE SHOT - HANDS UNTYING NEVILLE - SEMI-DARKNESS


WE SEE HANDS quickly loosening the ropes on Neville's ankles and hands.


MED. SHOT - NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW


Shadow of someone above him.


MED. SHOT'- NEVILLE FREEING SELF FROM ROPES


He pulls loose from the last rope.


          NEVILLE
Who are you?


          DUTCH (O.S.)
Shut up. Move, move, MOVE!


Neville begins to run, pushed by the shadowy figure.


SEQUENCE OF SHOTS:


MED. CL0SE - NEVILLE running to edge of field.


MED. LONG - NEVILLE AND FIGURE running into ramp area, disappearing under stands.


MED SHOT - NEVILLE Figure behind him pushes him along in the darkness, giving him no pause.


LONG SHOT MATTHIAS AND FAMILY RECOVERING FROM LIGHT Matthias and his people are re-grouped, looking for Neville.


CLOSE SHOT - MATTHIAS


          MATTHIAS
Find him. Search the Corridors... the storerooms...everywhere...


CLOSE SHOT NEVILLE


Figure behind pushes him through a door, slams it closed. Neville falls to his knees, shakes his head, trying to get his bearings. A beam of light from an electric torch sitting on a box dimly illuminates the room. He rises, starts to turn. Then, from shadows behind


him, between lockers he HEARS:


          LISA (O.S.)
All right, son of a bitch. Just hold tight...
(beat)
Uh-uh, don’t turn. Stand. When I want you turned, I’ll turn you. on or off or around.


Lisa’s voice is low, smooth, sophisticated, but there is in It the sound of a profound self-confidence.


MED. LONG SHOT - NEVILLE - REAR VIEW AGAINST LIGHT


Lisa slowly drifts INTO FRAME LEFT. FOCUS is on Neville. Lisa’s head, right shoulder are blurred.  Her hand comes up holding a .45 automatic. FOCUS MOVES TO GUN, Neville still In B.G.


          LISA
That’s fine. Now put your hands out... way out, shoulder high. Like they were going to crucify you.


CLOSE - NEVILLE


looking AT CAMERA, his head and shoulders in LEFT HALF OF FRAME. In shadows behind,  WE SEE LISA vaguely, the .45 VIVID in SHAFT OF LIGHT from torch.


          NEVILLE
As a matter of fact, they were going to roast me. Why did you stop them?


Lisa comes closer. We can SEE HER. She Is beautiful, and black. She Is wearing a shirt, tails tied, and long shorts, with cycle boots. Her face is composed, almost amused as she moves up behind Neville.


          LISA
We've got a reason,


Neville's eyebrows rise. He is setting himself to turn on her.


          NEVILLE
My name is Robert...


          LISA
Your name's mud, Mister.


Neville whirls, CAMERA FOCUSES on Lisa who lifts the .45, brings it chopping down with moderate force.


MED. TWO-SHOT - NEVILLE AND EISA


Lisa is breathing a little harder, but her composure is fine. She cooks pistol. Neville is getting off floor staring into muzzle of .45, rubbing his head, looking at the girl with grudging respect.


          LISA
...and you’re not going to need a name if you fool with me again.


She nudges Neville toward the door. He raises his hands automatically. They walk.


          NEVILLE
Where did you pick up that cute way of saying stop?


WE SEE LISA still behind, looking from one side to the other as they traverse corridors.


          LISA
Oakland. I was a Raider. Anyhow, I only said slow. You know how I say stop?


The pistol nudges Neville's ribs. Neville keeps walking.


          NEVILLE
You keep clowning around, and those spooks out there are going to...


          LISA
Shut up. Dutch is taking care of the honks.


LONG SHOT - FROM CORRIDOR OF STADIUM LOOKING OUT ONTO FIELD


WE SEE MATTHIAS' PEOPLE running closer toward the corridor, This shot, we discover, Is from POINT OF VIEW of the shadowy figure, Dutch, who now stands in darkness. WE HEAR Dutch fumbling with something. CAMERA FOCUSES now on F.G. Dutch’s hand rises, holding cylindrical container. Matthias' people still in B.G. reach corridor entrance. Dutch throws container.


REVERSE SHOT - CORRIDOR FROM MATTHIAS' POINT OF VIEW


As they try to enter, there is a blinding explosion of LIGHT, only moderate SOUND, as a phosphorus grenade explodes. SHOT should capitalize on diffusion, refraction of phosphorus blow-up, its brilliant blue-white glare.


          MATTHIAS
No, no ... get back ... The next entrance...


MEDIUM TWO SHOT - NEVILLE AND LISA


Neville is in F.G., Lisa behind with pistol. They are trotting.


          LISA
Okay... stop, Open it up.


They are standing near a utility room. Neville turns and sees her for the first time.


          NEVILLE
You’re..!


          LISA
Okay, you've seen me before. Pull it out buster ... move!


Neville wheels out a small motorcycle,


          NEVILLE
(admiringly)
You plan ahead...


          LISA
We plan every which a way. Now look, you're gonna ran this thing, but I'm the ramrod, you know?


Neville says nothing, seating himself on the bike.


          LISA
Do me a favor, will you? Don't screw up. I know how to roll, Out It's hard on the elbows ... and oh, yeah, If you just have to play James Bond, I'm gonna sift your brains All over the walls,


Neville grins In spite of himself.


          NEVILLE
Yes, ma'am...


CAMERA PULLS BACK as he, starts cycle and they move OFF down shadowy corridors.


LONG SHOT - MATTHIAS AND FAMILY IN CORRIDOR


They tan along corridor, seeking Neville. SOUND of bike can be heard


MED. CLOSE SHOT - CANISTER ROLLING INTO MATTHIAS' PATH


As we see another grenade appear, we HEAR Alts laughter from side corridor. Grenade explodes, spurting burning phosphorus onto one of Family. CAMERA PULLS OUT to MED. SHOT as Family member SHRIEKS in pain.


          MATTHIAS
Down the other way. We'll catch them at the main exit ...


The ramp.


SERIES OF SHOTS - NEVILLE AND LISA ON BIKE IN CORRIDORS


Lisa yells directions to him as Neville skids bike around corners, in and bat, around obstacles like heaps of cushions, piles of coke cases, etc, Shot should take advantage of bike light, refractions, shadows, veering off bike, near collisions.


          LISA
Left, left, goddamn It.
(beat)
Another left and step on it.


LONG SHOT - RAMP OF STADIUM


Shot is from Dutch’s POINT OF VIEW. CAMERA PULLS BACK, revealing Dutch, standing about ten yards  from ramp. He holds a grenade In each hand. It is still dark, but the first signs of pre-dawn are APPEARING.  We HEAR the roar of the Family as they run inside the corridor toward ramp. As they APPEAR, Dutch lofts the first one and then the other grenade, tossing one on each side of the exit, leaving a narrow passage directly in the  middle, free of the phosphorous, though bathed in blinding LIGHT. Matthias and Family fall back in confusion.  We HEAR sound of bike over their yells, Dutch’s laughter.


MED. SHOT - NEVILLE AND LISA ON BIKE


They skid around final corner. Neville hits brakes, Leaves rubber.


REVERSE LONG SHOT - DOWN CORRIDOR, NEVILLVES POINT OF VIEW


Matthias and his people, turned and blinded by burning phosphorus, HEAR Neville coming. CAM8RA ZOOMS to MED. CLOSE SHOT, Matthias.


          MATTHIAS
He is coming ... There...


MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE AND LISA ON BIKE


          LISA
What the hell you stopped for?  Hit It, you dumb honk!


          NEVILLE
You want me to?


Lisa prods him with the pistol.


          LISA
Right on, you lump. They're blinded. Right on!


Neville shrugs, races engine.


          NEVILLE
Okay, baby, hitch up your drawers...


He revs engine, kicks off straight toward Matthias and Family.


LONG SHOT - MATTHIAS AND FAMILY NEVILLES POINT OF VIEW


We see Matthias and the rest coming closer and closer as SOUND of bike becomes deafening Behind Family is burning phosphorus. Matthias Puts out his hands as If to wave Neville to a stop.


          MATTHIAS
Stop them, stop them...


FLASH CUT - CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S FACE.


LONG SHOT - MATTHIAS AND FAMILY NEVILLES POINT OF VIEW Shot MOVES RAPIDLY closer to Family.


FLASH CUT - CLOSE SHOT - LISA,'S FACE


          LISA
Down the middle, right down he middle!


MEDIUM SHOT - SIDE ANGLE - COLLISION OF BIKE AND FAMILY


As bike flashes through them, some of the Family try to stop Neville. Bike veers, rights, sails through, knocking Family members in all directions,


MEDIUM-SHOT - BIKE GOING BETWEEN PHOSPHORUS GRENADES


Neville manages to steer down slot between the two bombs Dutch has thrown. For a moment, the bike and its riders are bathed in weird glow of phosphorus. Howls of disappointed Family can be heard.


LONG SHOT - LISA AND NEVILLE ON BIKE DUTCHS POINT OF VIEW


They roar down ramp and into empty parking lot. CAMERA PULLS BACK showing Dutch in F.G. cranking up his own bike, laughing exultantly at the success of the escape. He watches Neville and Lisa race away, and after another look in the direction of the stadium where the grenades still burn, he follows them.

MED. SHOT - SIDE ANGLE - LISA WITH ARM AROUND NEVILLE


She has left arm around his middle, gun in right hand aimed into ribs. Yells Into his ear:


          LISA

As they reach exit, Neville wheels the bike suddenly. Lisa has to grab him with both hands. He plucks gun from her hand, lowers the hammer as they speed down off-ramp. Lisa Yells:


          LISA

Neville LAUGHS, hands her back the gun. She sticks it into her belt and puts both arms around him at they go off onto country road.

          LISA
You’re sweet. Now just walk on up to that house.


MED, LONG SHOT - LISA AND NEVILLE WALKING TO HOUSE

MED. SHOT - LISA AND NEVILLE WALKING INTO HOUSE


It is moderately dark In house. Neville rubs his eyes. SHOT is still ACROSS GUN BARREL. Neville sees gunman. Lisa moves up beside him.

          LISA
(to Neville)
Have you got any idea what Tom would have done If you'd come up to this house carrying my .45?


Neville nods.


          NEVILLE
I’m beginning to get an idea.


CAMERA PULLS OUT as others walk into light. They have been waiting to see what was happening.


          LISA
This is the crop...


There are perhaps six or eight young people about evenly divided between boys and girls. The others, except for Lisa and her brother, are white.


          LISA
All there is. At least that we know of. There are others around, I guess... If Matthias and his nuts haven’t killed them all.


Neville is astonished. The kids seem healthy, alert.


          NEVILLE
I didn’t know there were...any.


          LISA
(sardonically)
Between Matthias and his goons at night and you In the daytime shooting anything that moved, we stayed low,


          NEVILLE
I was staying Alive,


The others exchange glances,


          LISA
If you call that living.


Neville Is Irked. He did not come for a seminar In ethics. Then there is the SOUND of a motorcycle outside, All turn, toward the door,


          TOMMY
Its Dutch...


He runs toward door, Lisa and the rest follow, Neville in rear.


MED. SHOT -DUTCH


He climbs off cycle, drops kickstand. He wears a leather jacket, a air of pearl-handled .45 automatics on his hips. Saddlebags are staffed with grenades, a Thompson submachine gun, etc. Dutch also wears goggles, an old World War I style helmet, riding breeches and Jack-boots. His hair is long, and on the back of his jacket is painted the upraised red fist of revolution--with the middle finger extended. He is a tough cookie, but very bright indeed. Tommy and Lisa WALK into picture.


          LISA
Hey, it's the mad bomber. Where you at, baby?


Dutch pulls off his helmet, smiles at Lisa, ruffles Tommy's hair. CAMERA MOVES OUT to include others in GROUP SHOT. Dutch looks at Neville.


          DUTCH
I see you got my partner, the mad doctor, here all right.


CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S REACTION


          NEVILLE
You know who I am?


CAMERA MOVES OUT to GROUP SHOT


          LISA
Dutch knew about you. He knew your work...


Neville looks astonished.


          NEVILLE
My work...?


Dutch stares upward, hands in back of breeches, reciting from memory.


          DUTCH
"Biowar Pathology Parameters in Urban and Semi-urban Environment" Journal of Military Medicine, June, 1974, "Incremental Effects Countermeasures to Toxic Agents in Liquid Systems Delivery" Microbiological Letters, January, 1975


          LISA
God Almighty, Countermeasures to what...?


          DUTCH
To somebody poisoning your well.


Neville grins.


          NEVILLE
Where did you pick up on that?


          DUTCH
Med school, I was a senior when they scratched the whole world. I was going to apply to Biowar Labs for a post-doc, but the next term never came.


Neville is surprised, touched.


          NEVILLE
I'm sorry you didn't make it.


          LISA
If you all are done with the mutual admiration, you reckon we can go on Into Richie?


          NEVILLE
Richie?


They walk toward house.


          DUTCH
Lisa’s brother. He looks like he’s about to go over.


CLOSE SHOT NEVILLE


He frowns uncomprehendingly.


          NEVILLE
Go over...?


TWO SHOT- DUTCH AND NEVILLE


They have reached house now head down hall into darkened bedroom.


          DUTCH
Oh, that's right. You've only seen the tertiary cases ... We’re primary, you see.


Neville is stunned. It simply has not occurred to him that the young people are also victims of the plague.


          DUTCH
When it hit, the older people either died outright or went to the third stage pretty fast. You know: blindness in light, albinism, psychotic delusions, occasional stages of torpor: like Matthias and his gang.


          NEVILLE
And you?


          DUTCH
Some of the younger people had a kind of resistance. We...hold out. One or two of us are a little bit light sensitive, but otherwise all right. But Ritchie’s going. He's advanced secondary.


GROUP SHOT - AT DOOR OF BEDROOM  A girl comes out.


          LISA
How is he?


          GIRL
(shaking head)
No better. The color is gone from his skin, Lisa. He’s almost white.


Lisa shakes her head.


          LISA
If he wasn't out of his head already, that’d really blow his mind.


Dutch laughs without humor, lights a candle. They step INTO darkened room, close to bed. They look down to see a BOY lying on bed, tossing. His skin Is light- not dead white, but very light--though his features are African. His hair is natural, but also light His eyes, when he opens them, are white, but only iris is missing. Pupil is still visible. Neville leans down over him, studying him. This is our first chance to see Neville as Doctor.


          LISA
Well...?


          NEVILLE
Shut up.


SERIES OF SHOT - NEVILLE AND RICHIE


He goes over Richie carefully, checking vital signs, blood pressure, reflexes, etc.


          DUTCH (O.S.)
He could hold here for weeks and then come up one of Matthias' monsters--or he could go over in ten minutes.


          NEVILLE
(still examining Richie)
So they go through fever and delirium passing from your state to Matthias'? And then, At Matthias, they hold again. Indefinitely.


CLOSE SHOT - DUTCH


          DUTCH
I've seen them go over before. I almost got killed last summer by a friend. He went over without any warning. When I looked away. he was kind of pale and: his hair was going. When I looked back he didn't have any eyes.


MED. SHOT - GROUP


          NEVILLE
(looking up)
What did you do...?


Dutch shrugs, looks At Neville steadily.


          DUTCH
Why doctor, I did like you do. I killed the son of a bitch.


          LISA
(insistently)
Listen, if the Masonic rites are over, how about Richie?


Neville rises and they walk INTO NEXT ROOM. Other KIDS sit around reading, playing guitar, eating.


          NEVILLE
We'll take him to my place. I've got most of what I need there.


          LISA
(scornfully)
Is there anything you can do, Doctor? You’ve lost  200 million patients already.


Neville studies her a moment.


          NEVILLE
I don't have it.


          LISA
Have what? Time, a care?


          NEVILLE
I don't have the plague. I'm immune.


REACTION SHOT - GROUP OF YOUNGSTERS


Even Lisa looks awed. Dutch frowns, confused.


          DUTCH
Everybody...has it


          NEVILLE
(quietly)
Everybody but me. There was a vaccine. Only an experimental batch. We never thought...


PAN SHOT - YOUNGSTERS


They watch Neville expressionless


          DUTCH

I tried. Have you got any Idea how many steps it takes to synthesize an antibiotic specific to this bag?


SERIES OF FLASH CUTS INTERCUT DURING SPEECH

Neville has a glucose drip set up, and on a table beside the bed various equipment for blood samples, etc. He stands looking down at the boy who mumbles, twists, resting uneasily. Neville picks up a hypo, draws some fluid from a small phial, gives Richie a shot. After a moment or so, his restlessness abates. Lisa comes into room quietly, comes up behind Neville quite close. She is in shadow, only barely visible.


          LISA
How about a break?


          NEVILLE
Well need one. There's nothing more to do until tomorrow...

The same way you found the jacket. I hustled it.


Neville looks thoughtful.


          NEVILLE
I wonder why either of as bothered to pick them up.


Lisa finishes a mouthful of food.


          LISA
No bother. The house-fuzz was on extended vacation. Anyhow, you never believe you're the only one left. There was a song: someday my prince will come...


Neville grins.


          NEVILLE
Yeah. That was in Show White.


Lisa blushes, looks irritated, but goes on.


          LISA
I kept thinking, someday something's got to come along ... and that's about what happened.

Oh, Massa Neville, this year chile's gone to college. School of electrical engineering at Berkeley.


TWO SHOT


Neville rolls wine on his tongue.


          NEVILLE
I'm surprised you didn't barn the stadium down.


Lisa, Angry slams down her fork.


          LISA
Don’t be a wise ass mister. I saved your tail. Anyhow, if you'd been listening to the kids at Berkeley instead of fooling around in a lab with your superbugs...


Suddenly, from outside, where it Is now dark, we HEAR:


          MATTHIAS (O.S.)
So you’re back, Neville. That escape was very clever very "scientific.


Neville goes on eating. Lisa looks up, her face frozen with an old fear,


          NEVILLE
What's wrong...


          LISA
Nothing. Oh, its his voice. I’ll never get used to it, to hearing it.  We were with him for a while, you know


CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE


He is surprised, Interested.


          NEVILLE
With him?


CLOSE SHOT - LISAS PROFILE


          LISA
When it happened when even the army fell apart and there was nobody left, Matthias would walk the streets at night ringing a bell. What people were left lived alone, like animals. Richie and I had as a place In the back of a furniture store... We heard his bell, and we came out to see... And there were other people. We thought we were alone...


MED. TWO SHOT


Neville shakes his head.


          NEVILLE
There were weapons, cars, food

TWO SHOT - LISA AND NEVILLE


          MATTHIAS (O.S.)
We can hear the music, see the lights... it must be wonderful up there... everything a man could want.


Lisa has paused as Matthias' distant VOICE comes into the room. She shivers and continues.


          LISA
They noticed how different we were. They hated our skin, our eyes, They resented us because we could still walk in the sunlight, enjoy the breeze and the flowers and the clouds rolling in from the oceans.


CLOSE SHOT - LISA


          LISA
And one night, when they were awake and we slept, Matthias and the rest tried to kill all of us ... some of us got away and hid out.

It is quite dark and WE SEE MATTHIAS' FAMILY more as dark masses than as individual figures.

INTERSPERSE  WITH SHOTS of brightly lit penthouse, LONG SHOT - UP ANGLE.


          LISA (O.S.)
I believe he's right, don’t you?


          NEVILLE (O.S.),
I don't have to believe. I know.


          LISA (O.S.)
If all this hadn’t happened, what do you suppose you would have done.  Sooner or later.


          NEVILLE (O.S.),
I don’t know. Maybe I'd have stayed out one night, or walked downstairs, sooner or later.


          LISA (O.S.)
It's different now, for me...


MED. SHOT - INT. APARTMENT, LISA AND NEVILLE


As Lisa speaks, we HEAR the GENERATOR, which is a constant sub-sound in all scenes in Neville's apartment, SPUTTER and FAIL, then START again, MUSIC LOSES SPEED, WHINES, COMES BACK to proper pitch, then power fails completely. Lisa rises as Neville springs from table. Candles now are only illumination.


          NEVILLE
Those bastards ... how could they get Into the garage? No, no ... it's out of gas. I haven't fueled it in two days.


As he talks, Neville is getting stun guns, flashlight, grenades. He tosses a stun gun to Lisa.

Ah, so it wasn’t Neville who brought Brother Zachary down. No, look. Neville was only an instrument of punishment, wasn’t he?
(murmurs of assent, Yes, Brother)
Because Brother Zachary used forbidden things, he sinned against the night


Matthias STARES UP at Neville’s apartment.


REVERSE ZOOM TO BALCONY


MED. LONG SHOT - BALCONY TO INT. APT.


Neville has dropped gun, walks slowly to Lisa who lies on floor, raised on one elbow.


MED. TWO SHOT


          LISA
I... thought...


Neville does not smile.


          NEVILLE
Sure you did. You thought, the honky's freaked out. Give ‘em time, It always comes to this...


          LISA
(considering)
No, no....


She stands up with his hand to help her.


CLOSE TWO-SHOT


          LISA
(grinning)
I thought, it's got to be Matthias disguised in a Neville suit...


Neville embraces her.


CLOSE - LISA


Eyes closed she still grins, reacts to his touch. She finds she is covered with grease from Neville’s slide down elevator cable. She smears some of the grease on his face.


          LISA
But there’s nobody else like you, is there...
(beat)
... you pale-face bastard.


VERY CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S FACE


Even the touch of a beautiful woman after so long does not quite dull his edge.


          NEVILLE
What -was the old joke? "If you were the only girl in the world, and I were the only boy, all right but until then, don't bother me." So I guess you're the only girl in the world.
(beat)
You pretty black bitch.


CAMERA MOVES TO CLOSE TWO-SHOT


They kiss, break, look at each other: two people who've been through a lot for a long time. If there is a God, they want to thank Him for this chance to be human again.


LONG SHOT - SUN RISING, FROM NEVILLES BALCONY


CLOSE SHOT - LISA SLEEPING IN RUMPLED BED


She is alone, reaches out for Neville. Sun strikes bed. She opens eyes, squints with more than normal reaction to sun.


MED. SHOT - LISA GOING TO DRAW DRAPES


She walks rapidly to balcony, draws blinds. She is nude. She rubs her eyes, looks at her hands. Stands in shadow, worried expression on her face.


LONG SHOT - NEVILLE AT OTHER END OF APT.


He is COMING THROUGH door to Ritchie’s room. Neville does not see Lisa at first. He stands scratching head, considering how to proceed with Richie, walks over to laboratory facilities.


          LISA (O.S.)
How is he...?


Neville does not glance up, is still studying.


          NEVILLE
Stable. No loss of pigment since yesterday, vital signs steady. He's comfortable.


He looks up, sees Lisa, smiles.


          NEVILLE
I’m sorry. I was thinking. It is been a long time since I had anyone to take care of...


CLOSE SHOT - LISA


She stands in the shadow, smiles.


          LISA
You haven't lost your touch. You take very good care.


MED, SHOT - NEVILLE


CAMERA PANS as Neville walks over, CLOSE SHOT as he kisses her lightly. They exchange amused looks.


          NEVILLE
Well, let's get on with it.


          LISA
What?


          NEVILLE
We take a ride. I need some things for the serum. Want to come...?


          LISA
Richie...?


          NEVILLE
He’ll sleep for three or four hours. Well be back.


MED. SHOT - NEVILLE AND LISA IN DRUGSTORE


They are taking things from shelves.


CLOSE - LISA


STANDING before shelf, labeled PLANNED PARENTHOOD SUPPLIES. She reaches up, takes down a bottle of pills, tosses it from hand to hand, grins at Neville.


CLOSE NEVILLE'S REACTION


He returns the grin.


TWO-SHOT


Lisa tosses the bottle away. They walk from the drugstore hand in hand, Neville carrying a sack of supplies.


MED. LONG SHOT - NEVILLE, LISA IN CAR


pulling up in front of a hospital. It is surrounded by cars, an ambulance has crashed on the emergency ramp. The scene should take into account the awful final days of the plague, and how it must have been at the hospitals.


CLOSE TWO-SHOT - IN CAR


          NEVILLE
Why don’t you wait for me? There's no use your going in...


          LISA
Save it. You might need some


help carrying things.


SERIES OF SHOTS - INT. HOSPITAL


These should be SHOCK SCENES recalling the actual dimensions of the city's final agony. Neville carries his stun gun, remains impassive as they walk. Lisa reacts to horrors despite her toughness.


MED. SHOT - CORRIDOR


corpses scattered-here and there. Some on stretchers, some on floors.


CLOSE SHOT - LISAS REACTION


LONG SHOT - LISA AND NEVILLE walking through ward.


PAN SHOT - BEDS IN WARD.


In each bed there is a corpse, desiccated, skeletal, some are lying, some sitting up. One is half out of bed. The horror is moderated by the darkness and shadows of the ward. There may be an ECHO in this SHOT of PAN SHOT on FAMILY when Zachary is killed.


CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE AND LISA


Lisa looks straight ahead now. Neville, stun gun in right hand, keeps on lookout for Family members.


MED. SHOT - NURSES STATION


The dead nurses, desiccated, uniforms rotted, sit in various postures as death caught them.


CLOSE - LISA HOLDING ONTO NEVILLE'S ARM


MED. SHOT -- INT. OF LAB


it is light because of windows when Neville raises blinds. He looks around, spots a small centrifuge.


          NEVILLE
That’s it. I wonder if there’s anything else.


Lisa stands staring blankly at a calendar, March 1975.


          LISA
If there is, think about it. I don’t want to come back again.


Neville looks up with a small patronizing smile.


          NEVILLE
It gets to you, does it?


          LISA
I'm just fine, buddy. It would get to anybody who can feel...


          NEVILLE
Look: it's over with. Make believe the dead are happy.


CLOSE - NEVILLE


He has centrifuge, spots a white lab coat hanging on a clothes tree. Takes it down, looks at it, bundles it up and sticks it into centrifuge.


          NEVILLE
Come on. Let's go play doctor.


          LISA
I never learned that kind of make-believe. I just keep wondering, why me? Why did I live...?


          NEVILLE
Because you were young, strong and resistant. Thank your genes.


          LISA
(bitter laugh)
That's the first thing I ever did have to thank them for.


MED. TWO-SHOT - INT. APT. - NEVILLE ON COT


He lies with blood device in his arm. Lisa holds bulb to draw blood.


          NEVILLE
Just squeeze it gently. Keep squeezing ‘till the bottle's full.


          LISA
(uneasily)
Will one bottle ... be enough?


CAMERA PANS SLOWLY, SETTLING ON CLOSE SHOT OF PLASMA BOTTLE on left side of FRAME. It is empty. Neville and Lisa in B.G. Neville, Lisa in FOCUS.


          NEVILLE
Its 160 proof Old Anglo-Saxon. One drop will ...


          LISA
(trying to hide her queasiness)
Corrode your mind, send you running for the front of the bus...


          NEVILLE
(LAUGHS)
Well ... there aren’t any busses anymore. Go on. Start.


As he says last line, she begins. FOCUS CHANGES INSTANTLY TO BOTTLE. Blood gushes up, begins to fill the bottle.


CLOSE SHOT - BLOOD IN CENTRIFUGE


Centrifuge is turned on and begins to spin.


          NEVILLE (O.S.),
I was a very peculiar doctor those last years...


CLOSE SHOT WINE POURING INTO GLASS


          NEVILLE (O.S.),
I looked for ways of treating diseases that hadn’t existed...


MED. TWO-SHOT - LISA AND NEVILLE


drinking wine over sandwiches on-work table.


          NEVILLE
...until other doctors invented them.


          LISA
It was a peculiar world, wasn't it?


          NEVILLE
It was what we made of it. Everybody helped.


          LISA
They paid for it.


CLOSE - NEVILLE


Examining Richie. Finishes examination begins drawing blood with large syringe.


          NEVILLE
But the last irony is Matthias. Look who gets left behind to play Noah after the flood.


          LISA
Noah is up for grabs, Robert. Matthias is only a contender.


CLOSE TWO - NEVILLE LOOKING UP


          NEVILLE
UM...?


Lisa smiles at him. CAMERA MOVES OUT to show Richie coming around. He looks up, suddenly terrified as he sees Neville.


          RICHIE
(weakly)
Hey...


          LISA
Easy, baby. Its all right...


          RICHIE
Where are we? Did they get us...?


          LISA
Nobody’s got us, Richie. You remember that place where there was light? The place where the creeps all came at night trying to bring it down?


          RICHIE
Yeah, sure...


          LISA
This is it. This is Neville. He's ...the landlord, I guess.
(slyly)


Richie eases back, somewhat reassured.


          RICHIE
How sick is he?


Lisa smiles sardonically at Neville.


          LISA
He isn’t hardly sick at all, honey. Maybe just a little spooked once in a while.


He's going to get you well.


          RICHIE
Well, hell. You know there ain’t no way...


          NEVILLE
I'm going to try. What have you got-to loose?


Richie smiles up at him.


          RICHIE
Nothin' man. Not a thing. You go it, hear?


          LISA
He will, baby. He will.


VERY CLOSE SHOT - MICROSCOPIC SLIDE


on the slide we SEE CELLS being attached and destroyed by other cells.


          NEVILLE (O.S.),
I don’t know how much it will take. I’ll draw blood as often as I can. Well just have to keep pumping it to him.


          LISA (O S.)
(tired)
How long do you think it will take?


          NEVILLE (O.S.),
How do I know? Maybe it wont work at all...


Who do you think I am, Louis Pasteur?


VERY CLOSE SHOT - LISAS FACE


WE NOTICE that she is a little lighter than in past scenes. Streaking in her hair should now be somewhat noticeable.


          LISA
But its a chance...


MED. CLOSE - NEVILLE


He looks up from microscope.


          NEVILLE
Yeah, and it ought to be your chance. You need this stuff, too.


TWO-SHOT


          LISA
Not as bad as he does. And anyhow, he's my brother...


Neville studies her a moment.


          NEVILLE
That's why he is getting it first.
(beat)
And if it works, you understand what that should mean, don't you?


Lisa looks puzzled.


          LISA
What?


          NEVILLE
Hell be the source of more antibodies. The more people we can inject, the more we'll have serum for...the others. And when that’s done, we'll pull out. We'll take what we need, and head for the mountains and the valleys ... think of what's out there...


MED. SHOT - LISA


She is listening, but her expression shows that she is preoccupied with other thoughts. Neville has left workbench and walks across apartment. Lisa walks with him. They stop near liquor cabinet.


          NEVILLE (O.S.),
A whole world. Vines, fields that will grow anything we want to plant. Streams


full of fish again. Stands of timber...


          LISA
You sound almost...


          NEVILLE
Almost what?


          LISA
Almost glad that it ... happened.


CAMERA PULLS OUT TO TWO SHOT


Neville pours a drink, mixes one for Lisa. He looks up coldly, almost angrily.


          NEVILLE
I'm not glad, but I’m not moaning, either. I told them in Biowar, you people are crazy. This kind of research...
(breaks off)
...Ah, why do you think I was a colonel instead of a lieutenant general?


          LISA
Now they know.


          NEVILLE
No, they don’t know a goddamned thing. They're dead. We know.
(beat)
Forget it. Its not worth our time.


He takes off lab coat, climbs into coveralls, gets stun gun, belt with flashlight, grenades, etc.  He cocks stun gun, checks pouch for ammo, checks flashlight.


CLOSE - LISA


          LISA
Where are you 'going? Don’t you need some rest?


CLOSE - NEVILLE


          NEVILLE
This is the way I rest...I’ll be back before sundown. Don’t worry.


          LISA
Robert...


          NEVILLE
Later...


CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE WAVING FROM ELEVATOR - LISA'S POV


REVERSE SHOT - LISA


She looks sad, subdued tears in her eyes.


EXT. PLAZA - DAY


empty and the fountain splashes untended. We SEE a small FIGURE on a bicycle pedaling across the far side of the open space. It is the child we met in the house with Al and Richie and the Others. She conceals her bicycle at the edge of the plaza and scurries fearfully across the open space to the fountain. On the edge of its lowest basin, she lays out a pitiful array of flowers and an apple or two from a paper shopping bag she carries. She crouches, kneeling with her hands clasped, hardly daring to look up at Neville's tower.


          GIRL
Please...I brought you this stuff. Don't let them take me either, and put me in a bag. Please.


She HEARS the SOUND of an ENGINE roaring closer and races terror-struck, for her bicycle. As she DISAPPEARS, Neville's car crosses the plaza at speed, slowing only enough for the garage doors to open and ENTER. The girl's offering lies unheeded on the fountain.


VERY CLOSE HAND WITH HYPODERMIC NEEDLE


CAMERA PULLS OUT TO MED. CLOSE - NEVILLE is injecting Richie with serum. The boy is unconscious, mumbling deliriously.


          RICHIE
...got to move fast, keep on moving. That Matthias, he wants you. All the cops want' I you. They gonna get you, boy, they gonna make you come over, you hear?


This dialogue in background while Neville and Lisa (who is O.S. in dressing room) talk.


CAMERA PULLS


OUT.TO MED. SHOT. INTERCUT CLOSE SHOT - LISA, looking in mirror at a streak of silver in her hair.


          LISA
What do you think...?


MED. SHOT - NEVILLE


          NEVILLE
I don't. We'll have to see.


CLOSE - LISA


she uses mascara to cover the light streak in her hair. Stares at herself in mirror.


          LISA
He's all the brother I’ve got, all the family...in this world.


          NEVILLE
Don't sweat. This is his best chance.


MED. SHOT - NEVILLE WALKING INTO MAIN APT.


          NEVILLE
If there were time, I'd have trapped one of Matthias' things and tried the serum on it.


Lisa bristles at this.


          LISA
What do you mean "things”  Aren’t they human, too?


          NEVILLE
Yeah ... I guess you could call them that. How many are there? Forty? ... Fifty? The last of those four billion steamy bodies that were crawling around last time somebody took a count. They were a dandy bunch weren't they?


          LISA
They did the best they could. Who the hell are you to put down the human race?


          NEVILLE
Me? I'm nobody, baby ... but at least I know it. I was just part of the crowd, and I didn't think much of it.


          LISA
Well I do! They made the world...that's what it was all about.


          NEVILLE
No, honey...they RUINED it ... we're living in what they made of it, and God help us. Pretty soon those sick animals out there'll be gone, and then we will be too and all that'll be left is this
(points to his collection of cultural artifacts)
That one Rembrandt's worth more than everyone left alive in this stinking city! Maybe in a hundred years or so God’ll get around to kicking through the ashes down here and read Shakespeare and say, "Well ... maybe it was worth it."


          LISA
I've heard that kind of talk before, you uppity, honky pig...and I HATE IT!


          NEVILLE
Ohhh, lovely! Yeah ... I've heard THAT kind of talk before, too, and that got everybody a hell of a long way, didn't it? There're just about enough of us here to go through all that again, right?
(more)


          NEVILLE (CON'T)
You can found a Panther cell, and I can start up a White Citizens Council! Or shall I be the SDS and you can be the whole damn Harvard faculty?! Too bad we don't have enough folks around to do the United Nations over, isn't it!


CLOSE - LISA


She is boiling, but holds her control. She speaks quietly, matter-of-factly.


          LISA
Neville, you are a bastard. A class-A bastard.


MED. SHOT - LISA WALKING TOWARD DOOR


          NEVILLE (O.S.),
Where are you headed?


Lisa stops, turns.


          LISA
I know it doesn't mean much to you, but it happens this is an anniversary. Two years ago today, all those no-good people you just wrote off, died in this town. I've got a mother and father Richie and I buried with our own hands out there, after the Army stopped burning the bodies. Id like to go visit them, if it's all right with you!


Neville studies her for a long moment.


          NEVILLE
Sure, it's all right.


He tosses her something below CAMERA RANGE as he speaks.


          NEVILLE
Take this with you.


CLOSE - LISA


catches a stun gun, stands holding it, looks down at it, back up toward Neville.


FADE OUT


FADE IN:


CLOSE - LISA WALKING


rapidly, purposefully. SHOT IS HEAD AND SHOULDERS. CAMERA PULLS OUT TO MED. SHOT. She is walking along a path with grass grown up on both sides. CAMERA PULLS OUT TO LONG SHOT, DOWN ANGLE. WE SEE now that she is walking in a cemetery. The graves are overgrown, some of the stones fallen. The place is in general disrepair.


MED. SHOT - LISA AND GRAVE


She pushes aside some tall weeds and stands before a place relatively cleared, where someone has put gravel to keep down the weeds and has carefully outlined a large grave-site with coke and seven-up bottles by burying them in the ground neck down. There is a faded plaque of wood, probably the bottom of an orange-crate or something more substantial. On it are the names and dates of her parents:


Richard and Lorena McNally


Born, Montgomery, Alabama


Died, Los Angeles, California


1977


In front of the marker are a couple of tin coffee cans with the remains of long-wilted flowers in them.


VERY CLOSE LISAS FACE


She stands for a moment, silent, near tears. Then she speaks in a low, almost conversational tone.


          LISA
Listen, I know I don't come like I should. But it's hard times, momma, daddy. You never knew what hard times was. You only thought you did.


Suddenly, above her monologue, she HEARS a SOUND. A SOB. It .is not the sound of an animal, but a human sound, She whirls, a copy of Neville, the stun gun she is carrying ready to fire. She cocks it as she turns, and her face is hard. She sees nothing.


MED. LONG SHOT - CRYPT LISAS POV


Perhaps some thirty meters away through the weeds and grass, she sees a crypt. It, too, is overgrown with moss, ivy, and has not been cared for.


CLOSE - LISA


She slowly approaches crypt, gun ready, a little on edge, curious.


          VOICE (O.S.)
Oh, God ... oh...


Lisa stops as she HEARS this MOAN, then moves cautiously around to front of crypt. The door is ajar slightly. Again, like Neville, after a pause, she kicks door OPEN, jumps past it, glancing inside.


MED. SHOT - LISA - FROM WITHIN CRYPT


Lisa is outlined against the bright summer sky, her shadow long, only her silhouette visible. She stands looking inside. her gun ready.


VERY CLOSE LISAS FACE


Her expression is one of astonishment, utter sorrow.


MED. SHOT - WOMAN KNEELING IN CRYPT LISAS POV


The woman, a hood over her head and shoulders like a shawl, kneels beside a tiny body laid out on rags. Her fingers touch its leg or arm. She faces the body as SHOT OPENS. Then she turns very slowly to her left, looks up at Lisa from the deep shadows.


MED. CLOSE – WOMAN’S FACE - SLIGHT DOWN ANGLE


Her face is dead white, white hair straggled around it. Her eyes are the blank white of all Matthias' people. And there are tears running down her cheeks. In B.G. but clearly visible, WE SEE THE FACE of the dead child, its eyes, too, are white, blank. It is obviously a newborn infant.


MED. CLOSE REVERSE SHOT - LISA - SLIGHT UP ANGLE


The gun falls to her side. She stands for a moment watching the woman.


          LISA
I'm ... sorry...


MED. SHOT - LISA


She turns and RUNS AWAY from the crypt, back the way she has come.


LONG SHOT DOWN ANGLE LISA RUNNING THROUGH CEMETERY


CLOSE SHOT FOUNTAIN EXT. NEVILLE'S APT. - UP ANGLE


It is late afternoon. The fountain bubbles, its water spewing into the air and cascading down from one level to another, over the sides and into the bottom pool. CAMERA PULLS BACK, drawing Neville INTO FRAME, showing SHOT was NEVILLE'S POV. SHOT IS OF NEVILLE from BEHIND.


REVERSE SHOT - NEVILLE


Arms folded, he stands watching fountain splash. He enjoys watching it. SOUND OF CAR approaching in near distance.


MED. SHOT - LISA IN CAR


THE SHOT IS PAST NEVILLE IN F.G. Lisa pulls UP, parks the car, and gets out slowly, carrying her gun listlessly. She is absorbed in thought, stops a little behind Neville on the far side of fountain. She wears sunglasses and a scarf though it is not bright. Her hair has a few subtle streaks in it and her skin has lightened also. Neville has glanced at the car as it arrived, is now turned back to fountain.


          NEVILLE
It's an illusion, you know. It looks like a tapped spring, but there’s nothing new ... the same water coming up over and over again...


Lisa says nothing.


          NEVILLE
He's better. His skins a little darker; I can’t tell about his eyes yet.


MED. SHOT - ANOTHER ANGLE


Lisa is restless. She walks around fountain, looks through at Neville from the far side.


          LISA
He's got eyes like his momma, big and soft. Melting brown. I'll know when they're right. She always said held give the girls hell. And he would...if there were any girls.


CLOSE - NEVILLES PROFILE - LISA IN B.G. OUT OF FOCUS


He is looking past fountain.


          NEVILLE
Did you find ... your people?


HOLD SHOT - Lisa in FOCUS, not looking at Neville.


          LISA
Yes. Right where we put them down. We talked a while.
(beat)
And then something happened.


HOLD SHOT


FOCUS on Neville again. He glances through fountain at Lisa.


          NEVILLE
Oh...?


MED. SHOT - LISA - NEVILLE IN B.G. OUT OF FOCUS FAR SIDE OF FOUNTAIN


Lisa walks slowly back and forth, not looking at Neville, profile to us.


          LISA
A couple of Matthias' people were out there...


HOLD SHOT


Neville in FOCUS, looking at Lisa, interested.


          NEVILLE
Did you take care of them?


REVERSE SHOT - LISA THROUGH FOUNTAIN NEVILLES POV


Lisa turns to fade him now, angrily.


          LISA
NO. I did not. I didn’t do a goddamned thing but look and choke and run.


MED. CLOSE - NEVILLE THROUGH FOUNTAIN - LISAS POV


He looks puzzled at her angry response. As she continues, his expression changes to one of compassion.


          LISA (O.S.)
Because one of them was a dead baby Stillborn, like all of them. And the other one was its mother. And because I don't go around shooting mothers and babies anyhow...


CLOSE SHOT - LISA


          LISA
...and because In nine months I could be on my knees right where she was...


VERY CLOSE ZOOM SHOT - NEVILLE THROUGH FOUNTAIN


His reaction to Lisa's announcement of possible pregnancy.


          NEVILLE
What are you talking about?


CLOSE SHOT - LISA - SITTING ON EDGE OF FOUNTAIN


She is turned away from Neville, looking INTO CANERA, still angry.


          LISA
Well, now, man, I’m not sure. I mean, I missed my appointment with the obstetrician and he was out of rabbits anyhow. But I was sick as a hound dog this morning and right now I feel like I’ve been eating weeds.


CLOSE NEVILLE'S REACTION


          NEVILLE
Well I'll be damned...


CLOSE - LISA


turns toward him.


          LISA
That is a damn good bet.


LONG TWO-SHOT - DOWN ANGLE


Neville walks around fountain to join Lisa. She turns, looks up at him, rises. They embrace, kiss, walk toward garage entrance together.


VERY CLOSE SHOT - PENLIGHT BEAM, DIRECTLY INTO CAMERA


FRAME is FILLED with LIGHT. It moves a little back and forth.


          NEVILLE (O.S.),
Does that hurt...?


          RICHIE (O.S.)
A little ... yeah, it hurts. How about off man?


MED. GROUP SHOT - NEVILLE, LISA. RICHIE IS IN BED


Ritchie’s color is now clearly returning. His hair is perhaps dark blond, light tan. Lisa is smiling. So is Neville.


          NEVILLE
A week ago, that much light would have driven you crazy.


Richie LAUGHS, snaps his fingers. He is a tough young man, not easily impressed, but his recovery has made him demonstrative.


          RICHIE
(sings)
...I'm beginning to see the light...


          NEVILLE
(to Lisa)
He’s doing fine. We can move him any-time now.
(to Richie)
Get some rest. You’re going to need it.


MED. TWO SHOT - LISA AND NEVLLE WALKING INTO MAIN APT.


          LISA
Move him...?


          NEVILLE
Sure. I'll have another batch of the serum ready in a few hours, and that's It. We'll load up the Land Rover in the garage, meet Dutch and the others and head out. How about the Sierras? Maybe Washington...it doesn't matter.


CLOSE SHOT - LISA


who smiles with delight at the news.


MED. TWO SHOT - LISA AND NEVILLE


Neville goes to his laboratory workbench. Lisa calls back to Richie. CAMERA STAYS ON LISA.


          LISA
What you want to eat, honey?


          RICHIE (O.S.)
Gimme some more of that great chicken soup...Ugh!


Lisa LAUGHS, goes to cabinet for soup, takes it to stove.


          LISA
(to Richie)
Listen, you feel like coming out here to eat it?


          RICHIE (O.S.)
Sure. You better ask the man, though.


          LISA
Hey...


CAMERA PANS TO NEVILIE, grinning.


          NEVILLE
All right. Put on that robe I brought you. And walk easy. You may feel a little giddy.


Lisa WALKS INTO FRAME, kisses Neville.


          LISA
He's been giddy for 18 years.


Lisa has a gun, wears her sunglasses and a shoulder purse.


          NEVILLE
What are you up to?


          LISA
You say we're going to leave. I'm going to hit the stores. What I pick up today, you’re going to be seeing for a long time.


Neville pauses in his work, looks concerned.


          NEVILLE
Why don't you skip it. In those stores, some of them...


          LISA
(laughing)
The most dangerous thing I ever came across in those stores was ... you.
(seriously)
Look, I got my gun.


MED. SHOT - LISA AND NEVILLE - ANOTHER ANGLE


Neville shrugs, half-smiling.

Lisa’s voice is strange and distant, and odd quality in It as if it were being heard through water.


          LISA (O.S.)

At the end of the sequence, se SEE some of the FAMILY setting FIRE to the draperies, the books, the kindling left of furniture. One of the creatures begins to SMASH the lenses of the balcony floodlights. During this sequence, Matthias VOICE COMES OVER


          MATTHIAS (O.S.)

This is down angle shot from behind Matthias with Lisa, Neville below. Matthias, In F.G. throws spear with all his strength.


CLOSE SHOT - SPEAR INTO CAMERA


CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE


The spear strikes him In chest. He falls backward into fountain, the bottle of plasma falling from his coverall.


CLOSE SHOT - TOP OF FOUNTAIN


We see Matthias across jet of water at top of fountain. As Matthias speaks, the water at top of jet turns red,


          MATTHIAS
The bad dream is over, Neville.


Now we can sleep in peace.


MED. CLOSE - NEVILLE


He has fallen against pillar In center of fountain, bleeding profusely, but still alive. Then he HEARS A VOICE O.S.


          LISA (O.S.)
Robert...Robert...


          NEVILLE
Lisa, where are you?


Her voice is odd, quaky. It is not the voice we know. She Lurks at the edge of the FRAME.


          LISA
I came to Matthias, he knows...


MED. LONG SHOT - LISA IN SHADOW


The SUN Is now beginning to come ONTO PLAZAI Lisa must retreat as It gradually narrows the area of the plaza still In shadow.


          LISA
to see that you were...


          NEVILLE
Yes?


          LISA
Evil, that Brother Matthias was right...


          NEVILLE
I... love you.


          LISA
I have to be part of something else


the Family, I have to have...


CLOSE - NEVILLE


His head Is back as the sun strikes the fountain. His eyes are open. When the sun reaches his face, his eyes do not blink. He is dead still, we HEAR Lisa’s voice going on and on.


          LISA (O.S.)
have to have The Family, Robert, do you understand? You understand, don't you, Robert?


We HEAR SOUND of GENERATOR, which has been In B.G. all during this sequence. It COUGHS, CUTS OUT, COMES.BACK ON.


LONG SHOT - DOWN ANGLE - PLAZA WITH FOUNTAIN CENTERED


Neville is motionless In center. Lisa flits along the edge of the receding shadow as the sun eats away the area. She retreats back toward the smoking building.


          LISA (O.S.)
The Family is everything, Robert  ...I came back to the ... Family...


Her voice gets more and more distant as It FADES completely.


CLOSE SHOT - TOP OF FOUNTAIN


Again we HEAR GENERATOR CUT OUTO COUGH, COME ON, AND STOP. Water In fountain matches this rhythm, stopping at last, lights go out.


CAMERA MOVES IN SLOWLY ON NEVILLE - HOLDS


In SOUND TRACK WE HEAR LOUDLY the SOUND of the MOTOR. It becomes quite LOUD. While CAMERA DRIFTS AROUND FOMUTAIN SLOWLY. We HEAR SOUNDS of people getting out of the truck. We HEAR VOICES. CAMERA COMPLETES ITS CIRCUIT OF FOUNTAIN. In B.G. beyond fountain and Neville’s body, we SEE the YOUNG PEOPLE HE HAS FREED. They wear protective clothing, sunglasses. They see him, walk slowly toward the fountain.


MED. SHOT - YOUNG PEOPLE IN GROUP


They stand in mourning around him. Then Dutch steps forward, sees something in fountain.


CLOSE SHOT - HANDS REACHING INTO FOUNTAIN


Dutch reaches down into the red waters of the fountain, lifts from it the bottle of blood, holds it up so that the sun stands just behind it.


MED. SHOT - GROUP OF YOUNGSTERS


They look at the bottle.


CLOSE - DUTCH


He is obviously the leader now. He turns to the others.


SLOW ZOOM SHOT - LISA


She sits huddled in the shadows next to the garage somewhere at the edge of the plaza. She looks helpless and very old. Broken. She tries to cover her eyes and face.


GROUP SHOT DUTCH IN B.G. NEVILLES BODY IN F.G.


Neville’s body is OUT OF FOCUS.


          DUTCH
It's Lisa! Go get her!


Several of the youngsters go to her while the test move to the silent fountain and untie Neville’s body. CAMERA MOVES to SHOOT OVER Shoulder-shoulder.


CLOSE SHOT - DUTCH


We see In Dutch's face the same confidence and determination we knew in Neville. He watches impassively as they take Neville’s body to the shadowed area and arrange it.


CAMERA BEGINS SLOW RISING SHOT


Dutch in F.G. One of the youngsters has driven the old truck up into the plaza. Lisa kneels beside Neville’s body, touching his face, arranging his hands, mumbling confusedly, recalling the tomb scene of mother with stillborn baby. Neville’s body is carefully wrapped in a blanket. Lisa CRIES OUT.


          DUTCH
All right, lets move. We’ve got a long way to go.


CAMERA RISES TO LONG SHOT DOWN ANGLE OF PLAZA as Neville and Lisa are put in back of truck with youngsters all-around them. Dutch takes one final look around, climbs in truck. CAMERA NOW COVERS ENTIRE PLAZA AREA. Truck STARTS, PULLS AWAY. Plaza is now empty. We HEAR trucks MOTOR FADING in distance. HOLD SHOT. Then title appears on screen:


I AM LEGEND


FADE OUT.


THE END
