				DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. KERNAN'S THEATER - DAY

The marquee reads: "KERNAN'S BURLESQUE."  Below it hangs a sign: "GORDON

the orchestra inside playing an upbeat number.

TILT DOWN to the busy sidewalk.

				DISSOLVE TO:

INT. KERNAN'S - THE STAGE - HIGH ANGLE FROM THE BALCONY

Six girls sit on the stage, legs outstretched, in golden skirts as a
seventh, with one leg raised to her shoulder, dances on one foot in
front of them.

CLOSER ANGLE FROM THE BALCONY

The girls behind her do a tumble and a traveler comes down.  The
audience applauds.

STILL CLOSER - ANGLE OVER THE ORCHESTRA

The orchestra plays a final chord, then the traveler rises again.  PAN
left to where the spotlight waits.

Steve (O.S.)

	(calling)

Hey, over here!

THE STAGE - HIGH ANGLE FROM THE BALCONY

The spotlight swings to the right to illuminate STEVE MARTIN, a crusty
Vaudeville veteran in a tuxedo and top hat.  He holds a viola and plays
a note.

MEDIUM SHOT - STEVE

Steve

Steve Martin's the name.

He plays the note again.

REVERSE ANGLE - THE BALCONY

The patrons laugh.  Sitting in the second row are ASA YOELSON and ANN
MURRAY, each about 13 years old and childhood friends.

THE STAGE

Steve plays and dances to a Russian song, kicking his feet out in front
of him and doing tumbles.

WIDER ANGLE - OVER THE ORCHESTRA

He does one last tumble, rises to his feet and throws his arms up.  His
left hand reaches offstage, then returns holding a cello instead of a
viola.  He does a double-take and points to it with his bow.

Steve

It grew!

The audience laughs again.  Steve walks to center-stage.  A chair slides
out from the wings, stopping right behind him.

Steve

Thank you!

MEDIUM SHOT - STEVE

sits in the chair.

Steve

Tell ya what I'll do.  You call out a tune and I'll play it.

He looks around.

WIDER ANGLE ON THE STAGE

A man's voice calls out from the audience:

MAN'S VOICE

"Stay in Your Own Backyard!"

Steve

It's too dirty back there!

The audience laughs.  Steve raises his hat, revealing that his bangs are
sewn into it.  He puts the hat back on.

REVERSE ANGLE - OVER STEVE AT THE AUDIENCE

Steve

Any other tunes?

A MAN rises.

MAN

"Banks of the Wabash!"

Steve begins to point at him with his right hand.

ONSTAGE

Steve points at the man with the forefinger of his left hand, which also
holds the bow.

Steve

"Banks of the Wabash."  All right.  Now I'll tell ya what I'll do.  I'll
play it if you folks'll sing it.  Right?

	(gestures to the

	 conductor)

The key of "C," Professor.

He puts his bow to the cello and plays a low "C."  Then he starts to
play "Banks of the Wabash" with the orchestra, but no one sings.

He looks around disconcerted, taps the bow against the stage, stopping
the orchestra, and hangs an arm over his cello.

Steve

So you won't sing, heh?  Am I asking you to do me a favor?

	(points the bow at

	 the audience

I'm doing you a favor!  When you sing, what happens?  Your lungs get
full of oxygen.  It puts roses on your cheeks!

REVERSE ANGLE - OVER STEVE AT THE AUDIENCE

Steve

As a matter of fact, you either sing out or you get out!

He points to the exit.  The audience laughs.

FRONT ANGLE ON STEVE

STEVE

Now that we understand each other...

	(points his bow

	 at the conductor)

Let's go, professor.

He starts to play again.  The orchestra joins in but, again, no one in
the audience sings, except...

IN THE BALCONY - ASA AND ANN

Asa starts to hum the song, then he sings it.

ONSTAGE

Steve, amazed at the voice he's hearing, stops playing, rests his bow
against the side of his cello, and looks up at the balcony, just
listening.

IN THE BALCONY

Asa finishes the song.  The audience applauds exuberantly.

ONSTAGE

Steve applauds with them.

IN THE BALCONY

Asa looks around, impressed at the reaction.

ONSTAGE

Steve

Fine!  Fine!  Stand up and let the folks see ya!

IN THE BALCONY

Asa shakes his head, too shy for accolades.

Steve (O.S.)

Ah, don't be bashful!  Come on, stand right up!

ONSTAGE

Steve waves his hands in the air, goading the audience to make Asa rise.

Steve

Come on, folks.  Let's make him stand up.

The audience applauds loudly.

IN THE BALCONY

Asa rises to his feet.

Steve (O.S.)

Attaboy!

ANGLE OVER STEVE AT THE AUDIENCE

Steve

Let's have it again!

	(points his bow at Asa)

Give that boy a spotlight!

IN THE BALCONY

A spotlight lands on Asa.  He squints up at the glare.

Steve (O.S.)

Professor, let's have the chorus again!

The orchestra plays the intro to "BANKS OF THE WABASH."

ONSTAGE

Steve, sitting in his chair, waves his bow around as if conducting the
intro.

IN THE BALCONY

Asa sings the chorus again.  Ann looks at him adoringly.  He finishes
with his arms outstretched.  The audience erupts in applause.

ONSTAGE

Steve applauds enthusiastically.

IN THE BALCONY

Asa, almost embarrassed, sits down again.  A PATRON behind him pats his
shoulder.

INTERCUT - ASA IN BALCONY/STEVE ON STAGE

Steve

What's your name?

Asa

Asa Yoelson.

STEVE

Are you in show business?

AsA

Steve

Where'd you learn to sing like that?

Asa

Well, I sing with my father at the synagogue.

race with God, Asa.

TWO-SHOT - ASA AND MAMA

Mama

Where were you, Asa?

asa

I was... singing.

ANGLE ON PAPA

Papa

You mean you stayed home, practicing?  Is that what you mean?

Asa

No.

Papa

Then where were you singing? -- Stop cracking your knuckles.

MAMA

In the street maybe?

ASA

That's not exactly where I singing.

PAPA

Singing prayers in the street!

Asa

Well, no, not exactly.

PAPA

Exactly?  Asa, you must have been exactly somewhere, singing exactly
something, and for some exact reason.

ASA

Yes, Papa.

The doorbell rings.  They all look over.  Mama goes to answer the door.

ANGLE ON THE DOOR

Mama opens the door.  Steve enters, holding his hat in his hand.

Steve

You're Cantor Yoelson.  I'm Steve Martin.

Papa

How do you do?

Steve

I'm glad to know ya.  Your son has a real voice.

Papa

Oh, you were at the synagogue today for the service.

Steve

Uh, me?  Uh, no.  I just went by there to find out where you live.

Papa

Well, then where did you hear my son sing?

Steve

At Kernan's.

Mama

Kernan's?

Steve

Yeah, the burlesque house a few blocks from here.

Papa

The burlesque theater!

Steve

Don't you ever go there?

Papa

No, I do not!

They all look at Asa.

Steve

That boy's got a future in show business.  You see, I've been looking
for something like him for a long time.  I'd like to make him a regular
part of the act.  You've got nothing to worry about.  I'm booked solid
for the season and I move on to Baltimore tonight.

Asa

Baltimore!

Steve

Oh, I know he's pretty young, but when a boy's got a voice like that, he
ought to let people hear it.

Papa

You're right, Mister Martin.  Asa will sing, but where his people have
always sung.

Steve

I know how you feel, Mister Yoelson.  It's a beautiful thing to sing in
church.  But there's a lot to say for the theater, too.  And if you're
worried about my taking good care of him, why, I --

Papa

Excuse me, Mister Martin.  I think I know what's best for my son.

Steve

	(looks to Mama then

	 Papa)

I was afraid that's how you would feel about it.

	(to Asa)

Sorry Asa.

	(to Mama and Papa)

Good night.

Papa

Good night.

PAN on Steve as he walks to the door and lets himself out.

THREE-SHOT - PAPA, MAMA & ASA

Papa walks up behind Asa.

Pap

Asa...

	(he holds Asa's

	 arms from behind)

... I want your promise that you'll never go to that place again.

Asa cannot, does not, say anything.  Mama walks up to him.

Asa?

Asa

I can't.  I -- I can't promise.

Papa

Go to your room.

Asa walks off.

ANGLE OVER ASA'S SHOULDER - ANN'S WINDOW

Asa does a three-note whistle.  Ann walks to her window across from him;

INTERCUT - ASA AND ANN

Asa

Ann!  Go downstairs and get a ladder!  Put in here!

Asa

Hurry up!  Get the ladder!

of Jesus.

AsA

What did you bring me here for?  Why don't you let me find Steve Martin?

Reilly

	(sniffing)

Shush!  What kind of car was that you jumped out of?

Asa

A cattle car.  What difference does that make?

Reilly

All the difference in the world, my boy.

INT. FATHER McGEE'S OFFICE - DAY - SAME TIME

FATHER McGEE stands waiting for them, hands behind his back.  Reilly
escorts Asa into the room; John stands by the door.

Reilly

Here's another one, father.

Reilly takes his hat off, still holding Asa's arm, as John closes the
door.

Asa

Let me go, will ya?

McGee

Yes, let him go, Reilly.

	(Reilly obliges)

Don't mind him.  He just thinks he has to behave like a policeman.

	(to Reilly)

And I don't think he understands boys.

Reilly

Oh, no?  I've only got seven of 'em meself.

McGee

That's just what I mean.

	(touches Asa's elbow)

Now, suppose you tell me about yourself.

Asa sits in a chair.

McGee

Where are you from?

Asa looks down, saying nothing.

McGee

Where was he picked up at?

Reilly

In the freight yard.  He came in on a cattle car.  Can't ya tell?

McGee "tisks" at Asa.

McGee

If you knew anything about freight trains, you'd never pick a cattle
car.

ASA

I had to get here.

McGee

To Baltimore?  Why?

Reilly

He's got a job here.

McGee

What kind of job?

Asa

Singing.

McGee

Singing!  Where?

Asa

In a show with Steve Martin.  He's in Baltimore right now!

McGee

What about your family?  Do they know about this?

Asa looks down again, not answering.

McGee, with John beside him, looks down at Asa.

McGee

I see.  You know, before we do anything else, I think you'd better have
a hot bath.

	(turning to John)

And something to eat, John.

  CONTACT _Con-46D5950D31 \c \s \l  John 

Come on, my boy.

Asa rises and faces McGee.

Asa

Why don't you find Steve Martin and ask him?

McGee

	(taking Asa's elbow)

That's just what I'll do.

McGee turns Asa toward John.  DOLLY IN on them.

McGee

	(continuing)

And since it's singing he's interested in, John, why not let him sing?

Asa turns back in surprise.

Asa

Sing?

				DISSOLVE TO:

INT. CHAPEL - DAY

CLOSE ANGLE on Asa standing amidst a boy's choir.  He wears a pink
striped shirt, holds a lyric sheet and looks around uncomfortably,
listening to the others sing "AVE MARIA" in Latin.

Finally he joins in.  DOLLY BACK to show the entire choir.

INT. MCGEE'S OFFICE - SAME TIME

McGee stands lighting a cigar as Steve sits across from him.  The boy
choir is heard in b.g.

McGee

Tell me a little more about your work in the theater, Mister Martin.

Steve

I've told you about all there is.

	(rising)

Pardon me, father.  I don't get it.  Why would you be bringing me here,
asking me all these questions?  Is there something you want me to do?

McGee

I'll come to the point in a little while, Mister Martin.

IN THE CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

Reilly leads Mama and Papa around a corner and down the hall.  Papa
wears a black hat.  He sees the statue of Jesus.  Mama gestures to him. 
Papa hesitantly removes his hat.

INT. McGEE'S OFFICE - SAME TIME

McGee and Steve stand waiting.  From outside, Reilly opens the door and
Mama and Papa enter.

McGee

	(politely)

Cantor Yoelson?  I'm Father McGee.

They shake hands.  Reilly exits, closing the door behind him.

Papa

How do you do?

McGee turns to Mama and shakes her hand.

McGee

Misses Yoelson.

Steve

	(looking over McGee's

	 shoulder)

Hello.  Glad to see ya again.

McGee

Oh, you know Mister Martin?

Papa

We know him.

Mama

Is our boy here?

Papa

The description is like Asa.

McGee

I have a very strong feeling that...

The sound of Asa's voice now comes through singing above all the others.
 He sings in Latin.

Papa

So have I!

McGee leads them to the door to the chapel.

CLOSER ANGLE

McGee

It's not so much what's on the head as what's in the heart, is it,
cantor?

MAMA AND PAPA

Papa gives McGee a kindly look.

CLOSE-UP - ASA

He sings "amen," looking idly around.  Suddenly his eyes land on
something -- his parents.

FOUR-SHOT

Mama, Papa, McGee and Steve look on as Asa and the choir sing the
penultimate "amen."

ANGLE ON THE CHOIR

The other boys sing the final "amen."  The CHOIR DIRECTOR looks back. 
McGee signals to Asa.  Asa steps forward.

THE FOURSOME

Asa

Hello, Mama.  Hello, Papa.  Beautiful song, wasn't it?

They all walk into McGee's office.  DOLLY IN after them.

INT. McGEE'S OFFICE - SAME TIME

DOLLY BACK as Asa stops at McGee's desk and sets the lyric sheet down. 
McGee closes the door.

Papa

Get ready, Asa.  We're going home.

Asa

	(turning to face him)

I'll do it again, Papa.  I'll run away.  I'll find Mister Martin
someplace.

Steve holds his hat out.

Steve

Now wait, Asa...

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT - STEVE

His hat is at his side again.

Steve

Don't ya understand?  I wouldn't have you in the act if I didn't have
your father's consent.

Asa persists.

Asa

Then I'll get in another act.  I'll keep running away.

Mama

What are we going to do with him?

Papa

We'll decide that at home.

Mama

	(facing Papa)

Maybe we should decide now, Papa.

	(to Steve)

You said you would take very good care of our boy?

Asa looks on in amazement.

Papa

You would consider this foolishness?

Mama

I'm only asking, Papa.  If Asa is going to keep running away, I have a
right to ask.

McGee

I made inquiries about Mister Martin, and he's a man who can be trusted.

Steve

Oh, I'm sorry I started all this trouble, cantor.  And I wouldn't have
anything more to do with it -- except considering how Asa feels about
show business --

Papa

Show business!

Mama

	(to Steve)

Tell me, Mister Martin.  Exactly what would Asa do?

Asa

The same as I did at Kernan's, Mama.  Isn't that what you mean, Mister
Martin?

Steve

Yes.

Asa sits in a chair.

Asa

You see, Mister Martin's on the stage...

	(mimes bowing a cello)

... and he asks everybody to sing, but nobody does, because everybody
waits for somebody else to begin.  Now...

Asa moves into a chair.  McGee, Steve, Mama and Papa look on.

Asa

... I'm up in the balcony, and Mister Martin says, "Come on, folks! 
Join in the chorus!"

Steve sits in the chair opposite him and gestures upwards.

Steve

Don't be bashful!  All together now!

Asa

And then, all of a sudden, I stand up in the balcony and start singing!

Steve (O.S.)

I'm dumbfounded at the kid's voice and I say...

	(looks at Papa)

He's feeling fine.

Mama turns to a bulletin board.  Nothing is posted on it.

Mama (O.S.)

Indian-apolis.

Papa (O.S.)

Indians!  He'll come home scalped, yet!

- The next reads, "Kickabock, Iowa."

Mama (O.S.)

Kickabock.  Is this in the United States, Papa?

Papa (O.S.)

Ach!  Don't be foolish!

- The next reads, "Dubuque, Iowa."

Mama (O.S.)

Doo-boo-kay, Iowa.

Papa (O.S.)

Asa and Steve sit facing each other in train seats.  Steve holds a book;
Asa holds a pencil and note-pad.

Steve

Now spell, uh, "tedious."

Asa

T-E-D-O-...

Steve

Wait a minute.  That's wrong.  Try again.  "Tedious."

Asa

You wouldn't know how to spell it if you didn't have that book in front
of you!

Steve

	(glowering back)

I'm not learning, I'm teaching!

				DISSOLVE TO:

INT. THEATER - BALCONY - NIGHT

Asa, in a dark gray jacket and tie, sings "BY THE LIGHT OF THE SILVERY
MOON," clapping his hands together on the beats.  When he gets to the
word "moon," he sings it "moo-hoo-hoon."

ONSTAGE - STEVE

is dancing while he holds his cello and twirls his bow on his finger. 
He suddenly does a double-take.  Asa resumes singing normally and Steve
regains his composure and starts dancing and twirling his bow again.

IN THE BALCONY

When Asa gets to the line "We'll be cuddling soon," he adds a jazzy
"uh-huh."

ONSTAGE - STEVE

sitting in his chair now and playing the cello, hits a sour note.  He
looks up at the balcony nonplussed.

IN THE BALCONY

Asa finishes the song.  The audience applauds.  Asa nods back to them
happily.

ONSTAGE

Steve looks at him glowering.

				DISSOLVE TO:

BACKSTAGE - A CORRIDOR

A very grumpy Steve comes down from the wings as dancing girls head
onstage.

At the same time, Asa comes down a staircase from the balcony holding a
black cap.

As Asa passes Steve, Steve taps his shoulder with the bow.

Steve

Just a minute!

DOLLY BACK as they walk down some steps and along the corridor.

Steve

How come, all of a sudden, in the middle of the song you put in a
"moo-moo?"

Asa

I thought it would be a little better that way.

Steve

Oh.  You thought it would be a little better.  If the guy who wrote the
song wanted to say "moo-moo," he'd write it that way.

Asa

I just get tired of singing it the same way every time, Mister Martin,
so --

They arrive at their dressing room door.  Steve gestures with the bow.

Steve

So you thought up "moo-moo."

Asa

I didn't think it.  It just came out.

Steve

Oh.  It just came out.

	(holding his bow

	 out angrily)

Well don't let it come out!  You sing that song just like it's written
and I don't want to hear no more "moo-moos."

Steve goes into the dressing room.

Asa

Yes, sir.

Steve (O.S.)

Heh!  How do you like that!

IN THE DRESSING ROOM - STEVE

sets his cello against a wall.

Steve

He gets tired singing it the same way, so he puts in...

	(makes a face, rolls

	 his eyes and snaps

	 his fingers)

... "moo, moo."  As if that makes any difference!

He crosses past Asa to the door and hangs up his coat.

Steve

And another thing.  You're singing it a little faster every night.

	(into Asa's face)

Is that because you're tired, too?

Asa

No, sir.  That's because you're playing it too slow.

Steve, taking off the hat with fake bangs, suddenly freezes.

Steve

I'm playing it slow?  Excuse me!  I've only been in this business for
thirty years -- making a very nice living.  But maybe an old trooper
like you oughta come down on the stage and have people --

Asa

Oh, I've thought about that.  I mean, I could sing much better on the
stage.

Steve

You don't tell me!

Asa

Yes, because then I could sing right to 'em instead of the backs of
their heads, and I could see how their faces looked.

Steve

Faces?

Asa

Unless you can see the people's faces, it's no good at all.

Steve

You don't say.  And tell me, Mister Yoelson, with that spotlight shining
right in your eyes, how ya gonna see faces?!

Asa

Well, that's easy.  If you turn up all the lights in the theater, then
they can see me and I can see them.

Steve starts to mull it over, then does another double-take and glares
at Asa again.

Steve stops dancing and looks at him.

IN THE BALCONY

Asa looks back at the spectators, who laugh at him now.

ONSTAGE

Steve beckons anxiously to him to continue.

IN THE BALCONY

Asa tries again to sing but barely croaks the words out.  He holds his
throat.  More laughter from the crowd.

In a panic, he looks behind him, then suddenly he puts his fingers into
his mouth and starts to whistle -- a whistle as sharp and true as a
musical instrument.

ONSTAGE

Steve looks up in awe, rises smiling and points his bow at Asa.

INTERCUT

Asa continues whistling as Steve dances merrily again.

At the end of the song, both Steve and the audience applaud wildly. 
Asa runs from the balcony.

INT. DRESSING ROOM

A dejected Asa sits in a chair with Steve looking on.

Steve

You don't want to be in the act any more?

Asa

	(tears in his eyes)

No, Steve.  I'm goin' home.

Steve

Ah, don't be silly.  Your voice is changing, that's all.  In a couple of
years you'll get it back, better than ever.

	(leans over to him)

And listen.  The way you pulled that whistle out of the hat, that's
showmanship!  Didn't you hear them applaud?

Asa

But it isn't the same.

Steve

What isn't the same?  The act's just as good as it was before!

Asa

When you whistle, their faces don't look the same.

Steve

	(throwing his arms up)

Yah, faces again!

	(pacing)

This kid'll drive me crazy!

	(kneels beside Asa)

Listen.  I didn't say you're gonna whistle the rest of your life.  Just
for a while.  Look.

	(holds Asa's shoulders)

You know what we're gonna do?  We're gonna work up some whistling
routines and you're gonna work on the stage with me!  What do ya think
of that?

Asa looks at him like a ray of sunshine.

Steve

And do ya know something else?  Then you're gonna get billing!  Yes,
sir!  Meet that scintillating team of artists, Steve Martin and Asa
Yoelson!

Mama walks through the room reading another postcard aloud.

She stops, puzzled, and looks more closely at the card.  Then she calls
out.

Mama

Papa!  Asa isn't Asa any more!

Papa

What!?

Hurrying to her side, Papa takes the postcard and looks at it.  It is
signed "Al Jolson of Martin and Jolson."

Papa (O.S.)

Al Jolson?!

DOLLY IN on the bulletin board, now covered with postcards.  DISSOLVE TO
a PAN across several cards as Asa, superimposed, whistles and Mama and
Papa comment as before.

MAMA (O.S.)

In Reno, Papa, he's picking up time.

Papa (O.S.)

Is time something you can pick up?  This is crazy!

- The next postcard reads: "WallašWalla."  As we see it, Asa's image
dissolves into an image of the adult Jolson.

Papa (O.S.)

Walla-Walla.  This town they liked so much they named it twice!

He stops singing and smiles, impressed with his voice.

WIDER ANGLE

Jolson throws back the covers, jumps up, hurries over to Steve's bed and

Jolson sits on the edge of Steve's bed.

Steve

What's the matter?  What's the matter?

Jolson

Listen to this!

Come to me, for my dream of love is all, I love you as I loved you, when
you were sweet, when you were sweet sixteen.

	(speaking)

What do you think?

Steve

Are we going into this again?  In the middle of the night?

Jolson

But it's getting better every time, Steve!

Steve

All right, all right.  It's getting better.  I told you, let it alone. 
Give yourself time.  Go away.  Go sing in the bathroom.

Jolson

Why not let me try?

Steve

You mean, all of a sudden, come on maybe, in the middle of the act, you
want to bust out singing?

Jolson

Why not?

Steve

You're daffy!

Jolson

Why?

Steve

We ain't changin' no act in the middle of the season and fall flat on

Hello, Pop.  How's tricks?

Old Man

Letter for you!

He hands Jolson a letter from a cubby-hole.  Jolson looks at it.

Jolson

Mama.  Always on time.

He tears the envelope open and takes out the letter.  Meanwhile we hear
the stage manager (JONSIE) call out:

Jonsie (O.S.)

Overture!

Come on, Al.

WIDER ANGLE

Jolson

Gee, Mama's excited.  Three more weeks and we go home, Steve.

I could use a nice month's rest.

Jolson

Ah, not a month!  I don't want to stay home that long.  Just a few days.
 Then we have to get right to work on the new act on the stuff I'm gonna
sing.

Steve

I know, I know.  There'll be time.  Take it easy.  Just relax.

TWO-SHOT - TRACKING - JOLSON AND STEVE

DOLLY BACK as they walk off the stage and down a few steps to the
corridor where the dressing rooms are.  Jolson starts to hum "SWEET
SIXTEEN."

Steve

Stop arguing!

Jolson

Just humming a little.

Steve

When you start singing, that means you're getting ideas.

Jolson

Well, I was thinking of something.

Steve

Uh-oh.

Jolson

In Nashville and Charleston, the last two dates we play, why can't I
sing just one chorus of "Sweet Sixteen?"

Steve

No.

Jolson

Just to see how it sounds.  It won't matter if I flop.

TWO GIRLS in pink dresses pass by.

ONE OF THE GIRLS

Hello, Al...

Jolson

	(off-handedly)

Hello.

	(to Steve)

Just in Charleston, then.  Let me sing it once the last night.

They stop walking.  Steve looks at Jolson.

Steve

That little Carney kid is awful sweet on ya.  Why don't you give her a
tumble and get your mind on something else for a change?  Don't you ever
think of girls?

Jolson

Ah, I haven't got time.

	(takes Steve's arm)

Steve, all I'm asking is just one chance!  That's all.

Steve

Stop arguing!

BARON (O.S.)

	(drunk)

Hiya, boys!

DOORWAY TO BARON'S DRESSING ROOM

TOM BARON, a Vaudeville performer, looks out into the hall at Jolson and
Steve.  Half of Baron's face is "blacked up" and he holds up money in
both hands.

Baron

I bet the Kentucky Derby winner!  I win a snootful!

Steve

A snootful is right!

IN BARON'S DRESSING ROOM

Steve and Jolson step inside.

Steve

You'd better get ready, Tom.

Baron

I got ready, boy, and I win!

They seat him in a chair in front of a mirror.

Jolson

Tom, get yourself together.  You're on in a little while!

Baron

I'll be there with flying colors!

CLOSER ANGLE

Tom looks down at the cash in his hands and talks to it.

Steve

He can't go on like that!  We'd better tell Jonsie to skip the act. 
Come on, we gotta get ready ourselves!

Jolson

You get made up, Steve.  I gotta try and pull this guy together.

Steve

All right, but hurry up!

Steve leaves the dressing room, closing the door behind him.

Jolson pulls off his overcoat and tosses it aside.  Then he pushes Baron
back in the chair.

Jolson

Tom!  There's a big Derby crowd out there tonight!  The house is packed!
 You gotta go on!

He starts patting burnt cork onto Baron's face.

INT. MARTIN/JOLSON DRESSING ROOM - SAME TIME

Steve hurries in, shuts the door and takes off his top-coat.

INT. BARON'S DRESSING ROOM - SAME TIME

Baron

He passes out drunk in his chair.

Jolson

Tom!  Tom!  Tom!

He slaps Baron's face.  Baron is dead to the world.

DOLLY IN on Jolson as he backs away.  He looks into the mirror at the
burnt cork on his hands, takes a towel and starts to wipe it off.

Suddenly he stops, looking at his hands again.  He lifts Baron's head,
puts his head against it and looks into the mirror.  That settles it.

Jolson grabs Baron under the arms and turns him face-down onto his cot.

Jolson rises and takes off his coat, sits in Baron's chair, takes off
his hat and looks in the mirror.

wiry black hairpiece.  He gets up, walks into b.g., takes a coat from a
hook and turns forward again, revealing himself in blackface.

The two girls keep dancing.  Meanwhile, OSCAR HAMMERSTEIN and LEW
Dockstader take seats in a box across from them.

BACKSTAGE - SAME TIME

JONSIE, the stage manager, shields his eyes from the footlights and

Hammerstein and Dockstader settle into their seats.

Jonsie

Assistant Stage Manager

Down for the races.

IN THE BOX

Hammerstein nudges Dockstader.

Hammerstein

Lew, why do you drag me here when we could have been playing poker?

Dockstader

Anything on a stage, Oscar.  I love it.  I see 'em all.

INT. BARON'S DRESSING ROOM - SAME TIME

Jolson, in full costume and blackface, looks into the mirror and starts
to put a derby hat on.  A knock sounds at the door.

Male Voice (O.S.)

You're on, Mister Baron!

Jolson

	(in a low register)

Ready!

As Tom lies comatose in f.g., Jolson puts on a hat, straightens his big
black tie, looks in the mirror and smiles broadly at himself.  Then he
walks over to Tom and puts Tom's jacket over his shoulders.

Jolson goes to the dressing room door, unlocks and opens it.  The coast
is clear.  He steps outside.

IN THE CORRIDOR

Jolson closes the door behind him and locks it.  A SHOWGIRL in a black
dress passes by.  Jolson cautiously walks up the corridor and up the
steps into the wings.

Al!  Tom!

Hearing no answer, he turns and heads to the wings.

ONSTAGE - ANGLE FROM THE WINGS

The girls in pink keep dancing.  Jolson, his back to us in the wings,
waits to go on.

IN THE HAMMERSTEIN/DOCKSTADER BOX

Hammerstein turns to Dockstader.

Hammerstein

Any time you're ready to go, Lew.

IN THE WINGS

Steve rounds the corner, looking around.  Jolson looks back.  They see
each other.  Jolson looks forward again.  Steve walks up to him as the
music for the current act concludes.

Steve

Tom, are you all right, eh?

Jolson nods.

Steve

Where's Al?

Jolson shakes his head.

Steve

He was with you, wasn't he?

Jolson nods.

Steve

Where did he go?

Jolson shrugs.

The girls come offstage.

Jonsie (O.S.)

All right, Tom.

Tom's music begins -- the introduction to "MA BLUSHIN' ROSIE."  Steve
looks at Jolson.  Jolson shoots him a look back and runs onstage.

ONSTAGE

Jolson runs to center stage.

IN THE WINGS

Steve angrily gestures to Jolson to come back.

ONSTAGE

Jolson straightens his hat and tie and starts to sing the verse.

Jolson

There's a little bunch of sweetness

That I long to call my bride,

And believe me, I'm not happy --

	(talks)

But -- baby... Huh, funny thing.  I've s-sung this song a thousand
times, and I why I forgot it tonight, I don't know.

IN THE WINGS

Steve rolls his eyes skyward and covers his face.

IN THE HAMMERSTEIN/DOCKSTADER BOX

Hammerstein looks disappointedly at Dockstader, who looks at the stage
with encouragement.

ONSTAGE

Jolson starts humming the melody, then sings again.

Jolson

You'll hear me call her name.

	(talking)

I got it now.

Jolson throws a look back at Steve then sings the rest of the song with
tremendous power.

IN THE WINGS

Steve looks on as if he's watching God.

IN THE HAMMERSTEIN/DOCKSTADER BOX

Both men watch impressed.

DOCKSTADER

Baron's developed a very nice style.  Very nice.

Hammerstein nods happily.

ONSTAGE

Jolson finishes the song, takes off his hat and bows.  The audience
applauds -- among them a happy Hammerstein and Dockstader.

IN THE WINGS

Jolson runs up to Steve.

Steve

Al, are you nuts --

Jolson

Did you hear that finish?!

Jonsie

	(to Jolson)

C'mon, Tom!  Get out there!

Jonsie turns away.  Jolson looks frantically at Steve.

Jolson

But Steve, I don't know any more of Tom's songs!

Steve

Well, take a bow and collapse!  Get yourself off!  Go on!

ONSTAGE

Jolson comes onstage again, feigns illness, holding his hat in one hand
and the other hand to his forehead, and staggers back into the wings.

IN THE WINGS

Steve holds Jolson up and leads him backstage.

Jonsie

Tom!  What's the matter?

Steve

He's sick.  Can't ya see?

Assistant Stage Manager

Let me help you.

Steve

I'll take him back.

Steve and Jolson turn a corner.  Meanwhile Jonsie signals to a
stage-hand:

Jonsie

Jimmy, get the adagio team!  Hurry up!

A kid runs into frame, nods and runs off.

IN THE CORRIDOR

Steve leads Jolson down the steps into the corridor where the dressing
rooms are.  Suddenly they separate.

Steve

I'll murder you!  Gimme the key to Baron's room!  He could get thrown
out of the business for this!

Jolson

But the way I sang that finish, Steve!

Steve

Gimme that key!  We gotta get Tom on his feet!

Jolson hands Steve the key and Steve unlocks the door to Baron's
dressing room.

IN BARON'S DRESSING ROOM

Baron sits on the edge of his cot.  The door opens and Steve enters
followed by Jolson.  The hat is again on Jolson's head and he takes it
off along with the wig.

Steve

	(to Jolson)

Get that make-up off!

	(to Baron)

And you get yours on!

Baron stands up.

Steve

Jonsie, the stage manager, will be here in a minute to see if you died!

Baron

I gotta go on!

Steve grabs him by the shoulders and makes him lie on the cot.

Steve

Get this through your head!  You've been on!  You just came off!  You
got sick and had to quit after the first song!

Baron

	(rising)

I did?!

Steve

	(pushing him down again)

Don't you understand?

Jolson looks over from the sink where he is washing his face.

Jolson

You weren't on at all!  You couldn't make it!

Steve

	(gesturing at Jolson)

And that idiot went on and sang for you!

Jolson

You were a big hit, Tom!

Steve

Shut up!  I'll talk to you later!  Get that make-up off!

IN THE CORRIDOR

Jonsie walks to Baron's dressing room door with Hammerstein and
Dockstader behind him.  Jonsie tries to open the door then knocks.

Jonsie

Tom?!

IN THE DRESSING ROOM

Steve applies burnt cork to Baron's face.

Steve

	(calling back)

Oh, he's all right, Jonsie!  Nothing to worry about!

IN THE CORRIDOR

Jonsie

Mister Hammerstein and Mister Dockstader are here to see him!

IN THE DRESSING ROOM

Jolson turns from the mirror where he's been drying his face.

Jolson

Hammerstein!  Dockstader!

WIDER ANGLE

Another knock sounds at the door.

Jonsie (O.S.)

What's the matter?  Let me in!

Steve

Just a minute!

He sets the make-up container on a table and pulls a blanket over Baron.
 Meanwhile Jolson reaches for a blue bathrobe and puts it on.

Steve

	(to Baron)

Are you all right, Tom?  Did you hear what I told you?

Jolson

	(leaning over him)

See, you were a big hit, Tom!

Steve

Keep still!

Steve spits on his hand and wipes some burnt cork on his pant leg.  Then
he unlocks and opens the door, revealing Jonsie, Hammerstein and
Dockstader outside.  Jolson finishes tying the bathrobe around him as
they enter.

Steve

Come in, gentlemen!  He's feeling much better.  Just a little
indigestion.

Jonsie

	(pointing to Baron)

Mister Baron gentlemen!... Mister Dockstader, Mister Hammerstein.

Hammerstein shakes Baron's hand.

Hammerstein

I'm glad to know you, Baron.  You were great out there tonight.  Sorry
you couldn't do more.

BAron

Thank you, Mister Hammerstein.

Jonsie

Oh, this is Steve Martin, gentlemen.

Jonsie leaves the room, closing the door behind him.

Steve

How are ya?

	(points to Jolson)

My partner, Al Jolson.

Jolson

How do you do?

Steve

	(taking his hat off)

Martin and Jolson.

Hammerstein

	(to Baron)

I have an idea you might do very well at Hammerstein's Victoria, Baron. 
If you'd consider opening in, say, two weeks?

TWO-SHOT - JOLSON AND DOCKSTADER

As Baron and Hammerstein talk, Dockstader looks at Jolson.

Baron (O.S.)

Well, I, uh -- I don't know, Mister Hammerstein.  I --

Jolson

He doesn't know.  That's wonderful.  He gets an offer to play on
Broadway...

Dockstader looks behind Jolson's ear.

DOCKSTADER'S POV - JOLSON

Burnt cork remains behind Jolson's ear.

Jolson

... and he doesn't know!

Steve (O.S.)

That's a great break, Tom!

DOCKSTADER

looks back and forth between Jolson and Baron as Hammerstein talks to
Baron.

HAMMERSTEIN (O.S.)

I don't carry a contract around with me, but anything will do.

TWO-SHOT - JOLSON AND DOCKSTADER

Dockstader

	(to Jolson)

I'd like to talk to you.

Jolson

Who, me?

Dockstader

Outside.

Dockstader turns to the door; Jolson follows, bouncing a fist against
his palm.  Steve watches them go, then starts to follow.  Meanwhile:

Hammerstein (O.S.)

I'm certain we won't have any trouble about the terms.  I say, you're
going to enjoy playing my theater.

IN THE CORRIDOR

Dockstader paces to the opposite wall then looks back at Jolson.

Dockstader

What did you say your name was?

Jolson

Al Jolson.

Dockstader

Did you ever sing in blackface, Jolson?

Steve emerges from the dressing room.

Steve

Him?  Never!  Y'see, he -- he just whistles, Mister Dockstader.

Dockstader

Blacks up behind the ears to whistle, huh!

Jolson feels behind his ear.

Dockstader

You see, I've seen Baron work before.  Hammerstein hasn't.

Steve

I'll go in and explain to Mister Hammerstein.

Dockstader

I wouldn't.  Hammerstein knows what he's doing.  And I don't tell tales.

	(to Jolson)

And as for you, Jolson, you can join Dockstader's Minstrels in Saint
Louis next week.

Jolson

Ya -- you don't mean it!

	(turns to Steve)

Steve, you hear that?

Steve

That's from heaven, kid!

Jolson

	(paces back then

	 turns around again)

Saint Louis next week!

	(to Steve)

Then we have to leave the show on Saturday, Steve.  We can fix that,
can't we?

	(to Dockstader)

Ah, sure we can!  And there's a lot of new stuff we're planning to put
in the act!  We'll have it ready Saturday!

Dockstader

I can't use an act, Jolson.  I only have a place for one man.

Jolson

Oh -- oh, you mean -- you mean you just want me?

Steve

Well -- well, what did you think?  What would I be doing with minstrels?

Jolson

	(to Dockstader)

Oh, well, Steve and I have been together a long time, and -- and we're
working up a lot of new ideas.

Steve

Not me.  You.  But this is what a guy like you prays for.  Dockstader's
Minstrels in one jump!

Dockstader

Where you can sing your head off.

Jolson

Oh, you mean the job calls for a singer?

Steve

What are you talkin' about?  What did you think?

Jolson

	(to Dockstader)

Oh, then I wouldn't be interested.  See, I like whistling.  Steve and I
argue about that all the time.  He -- he keeps wanting me to sing, but
at heart I'm just a whistler.  Only thing that makes me happy.

The assistant stage manager passes by.

Assistant Stage Manager

Martin and Jolson, five minutes!

Jolson

Well, that's us.

	(shakes Dockstader's hand)

Well, thanks a lot, Mister Dockstader.  And if you ever need a whistler,
let me know, will ya?

	(pinches Steve's cheek)

Be with you in a minute, Steve.

Jolson walks off.  DOLLY IN on Steve and Dockstader.

Jolson

Must be on the train somewhere.

Steve

I'll see.

Steve walks back up the aisle, passes Dockstader and taps his shoulder. 
Dockstader looks at Steve and Steve looks back at him.  Dockstader
smiles, rises and goes to Jolson.

Dockstader

Hello, Jolson.

Jolson

	(looking up, surprised)

Hello, Mister Dockstader.  I thought you were going to Saint Louis.

Dockstader

I am.

So are you.

Jolson stares at him, thinking.

Conductor (O.S.)

Jolson

Where's Steve?

Dockstader

He's not coming.

Then I'm on the wrong train!

Dockstader

No, you're not.  This is the right train.  Steve wants you to go with
me.

Jolson

I can't do it!

Dockstader tries to block Jolson as he gets up.

Dockstader

But you're throwing away a great chance, Jolson!

Jolson

I can't, Mister Dockstader!

A CONDUCTOR shuts the door and turns away.  Jolson hurries to the door

cigar.  Jolson turns back.

Jolson

Excuse me, Mister Dockstader.  I've been looking for a chance for weeks
to --

Dockstader

	(taking the cigar from

	 his mouth)

I agree, Jolson.  You've worked in that quartet long enough.  Time you
moved up.  I'm going to give you a chance in a duet.

Jolson

Well, that would be fine, Mister Dockstader.  But the point is, if I do,
I'd like to try a different kind of song.  I mean, something with a
style that's better for me -- faster tempo, more rhythm.  I'd like to
look for something like that.

Dockstader

Sure, sure.  Talk to you about that again, Jolson.  Must be some song
around you'd be happy with.  Must be some song.

Dockstader walks out a stage door past an OLD MAN reading a newspaper.

Jolson in a duet sings "I WANT A GIRL."

EXT. THEATER BACKDOOR - NIGHT

Jolson's PARTNER walks outside followed by Jolson, both wearing straw
hats.

Partner

Where are you going to eat?

Jolson

I think I'll take a look at the town.  I've never been in New Orleans
before.

Partner

Don't get lost -- we've got a show tonight.

Jolson walks down the street past vegetable vendors.

CLOSER SHOT - JOLSON

walks along disinterestedly.  Suddenly he hears JAZZ MUSIC playing.  He
looks ahead, very interested.

ANGLE ON A DOOR

The music comes from behind the door.  Jolson steps up to the door.

CLOSER ANGLE

Jolson looks in through a small window in the door.

JOLSON'S POV - THE JAZZ CLUB

BLACK MUSICIANS are playing the jazz.

REVERSE ANGLE

Jolson looks in through the window and smiles.

Dockstader stands in the wings in blackface and his gold hat.  An
ASSISTANT walks up to him.  "WAY DOWN UPON THE SWANEE RIVER" is being

Assistant

Mister Dockstader, Jolson hasn't showed up yet.

Dockstader

It's too late now, anyway.  Cut the duet.

				DISSOLVE TO:

INT. JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT

The black musicians continue to play.  Jolson sits on a table-top, legs
folded, listening and bouncing with the rhythm.

DOLLY IN on a trumpet player playing smoke.

Jolson sits loving it.  Suddenly he takes his watch from a coat pocket
and looks at it.  He gets up, hurries to the door, then waves at
everybody.  They all wave back.  He runs out the door.

				DISSOLVE TO:

INT. THEATER - BACKSTAGE

Dockstader walks down some steps as Jolson enters through the stage
door.  He runs down the stairs after him.

Jolson

Mister Dockstader, I'm sorry!  I'm late, I know.

Dockstader

It's intermission.  We had to skip your number.

Dockstader goes into an office.  Jolson follows.

INT. OFFICE - SAME TIME

Jolson

I -- I'm very sorry.  I just forgot.  I know that sounds crazy, but I
heard some music tonight -- something they call "jazz."

Dockstader goes behind the desk, sits down and looks at some papers.

Jolson

Some fellas just make it up as they go along.  They -- they pick it out
of the air!  They tell me they play for weddings and funerals and...

Dockstader

	(looking up, not amused)

Funerals!

Dockstader gets up, walks to a shelf and takes an accounts book.

Jolson

But don't get the wrong idea!  You've never heard anything like this!  I
started to sing with them.  Nothing with words, because the song doesn't
have any.

Dockstader sits behind the desk again.

Jolson

In fact, it isn't even a song.  But you could make it one and get words
to fit it.  It just needs to be worked on a little.  It's exciting. 
It'll make the show a hundred times better!

Dockstader

I'm happy with the show as it is, Jolson.  But you aren't, are you?  In
fact, you never will be.  You'll always be chasing something up ahead
and keep forgetting your act in a little thing like a minstrel show.

		(MORE)

Dockstader (cont'd)

So maybe we ought to call it quits.

	(he rises)

Don't you think so?

Jolson

Yeah, I think you're right.

Dockstader

	(holding his hand out)

Well, good luck, Jolson.  I hope you find what you're looking for.

Jolson shakes his hand.

Jolson

Thanks, Mister Dockstader.

Jolson leaves the office, closing the door behind him.

				FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. YOELSON LIVING ROOM - DAY

Papa walks up to the bulletin board and looks at Asa's postcards.  Mama
looks at him through the dining room archway.

Mama

Papa, you're not going to start again tonight?

Papa

Can't a man ask himself questions?   In six months, three cards.  I
would only like to understand.  He leaves Dockstader and then no cards. 
Why?  Because he did not leave Dockstader for a better position --
because for a long time he isn't working!

The doorbell rings.  Papa walks the few paces to the door and opens it. 
There stands Jolson.

Jolson

Excuse me.  Do you happen to be the Yoelsons who have a talented young
son in show business?

Papa

Asa!

Jolson

Ah, ha-ha!

Papa kisses Jolson on both cheeks, then Mama runs up, excited.

Mama

Oh, Asa!

She gives him hugs and kisses.

Jolson

Yup, it's the right Yoelsons!

	(he looks at her at

	 arm's length)

Mama, you got younger!

Mama

Oh, no!

Papa

	(slapping his back)

Why didn't you say you were coming?

Jolson

Well, isn't this better?  This way Mama's having a good cry!

Mama

Asa, how are you?!  Look at him, a man!

Papa

	(grabbing his hand)

Did you eat, Asa?

Jolson

Eat?  What's that?

Papa

Well, Mama, he didn't eat!

Mama

Didn't eat?  Come on!  Sit down!

Mama takes Jolson by the arm and leads him into the dining room.

Mama

Papa and I just finished, but there's plenty!  I've got everything!

She runs toward the kitchen, then turns back.

Mama

Ooh, I've got to tell Ann!  Sit down!  Make him sit down, Papa!

Mama runs off, calling:

Mama

Ann Murray!  Ann!

DOLLY IN as Papa unbuttons Jolson's overcoat.

Papa

	(nervously)

Well, why -- why is she so excited?

	(taking off the overcoat)

What's there to be so excited about?

				DISSOLVE TO:

INT. YOELSON DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Jolson sits eating at mid-table with Papa on one side of him and Ann on
the other.

Jolson

Mama takes all the medals.  Still the best cook in the United States.

Mama walks to the table holding a plate of gefilte fish.

Mama

After what you've been eating, by comparison I'm wonderful.

She slips Jolson a yarmulke as she sets the plate in front of Papa.

Mama

	(continuing)

Look at him.  Shows you what you can tell from pictures.  He's skin and
bones.

Jolson smiles at the yarmulke and puts it on.  Ann looks at him and
grins.

Papa

	(turning to Jolson)

You see, Asa --

	(he stops, noticing

	 the yarmulke)

Well, that's nice, to put a cap on when you eat.  But Asa, did you wear
one all the time you were away?

Jolson

As a matter of fact, I didn't.

Papa

Well, for me it's not necessary.

Papa takes the yarmulke from his head.

Mama walks in with another two plates -- one large and one small -- and
sets them in front of Jolson.

Mama

Here, gefilte fish I made this morning.

Papa

	(folding the yarmulke)

And horse radish, fresh grated an hour ago.

He hands Mama the yarmulke.  She looks back at him.

Ann

Look out for it, Asa.  It's very strong.

Jolson

	(looking at her)

Who's that again?  Not Ann Murray!

Papa

Well, of course!  She grew up!  And look how pretty!

Jolson

That's what I mean!  It can't be.  She was just a funny little girl with
funny ribbons in her hair.

Jolson cuts the fish with his fork and dips a piece in horse radish.

Papa

Oh, and listen to that, Mama.  And you were such a prize I suppose, huh?

Mama

Asa was a beautiful boy!

Jolson

Ah, you see?

Mama

Let him eat.  Asa, the fish.

Jolson

	(holding his fork up)

Ah, I can taste this already.

He puts a red-coated bite into his mouth.

Ann

Not too much horse radish!

JOLSON

I don't have to worry about --=

He suddenly gags.  Mama pats his back, then Ann does.

Jolson

Magnificent!

Mama

See, I knew he would like it!

Jolson wipes his eyes with his napkin.

Jolson

Oh, wonderful, Mama.  Wonderful.  Really the best you ever made.  Mama,
you're terrific!... Tell me, Papa.  How's everybody been?

Papa

Oh, Mama and I have been well.  By the way, do you know who came to see
us a few weeks ago?  Steve Martin.

Jolson

Steve?  How is he?

Papa

I don't know.  He didn't look so well.  He said he was "picking up
time."  Is that good, Asa?

Jolson

If you haven't got regular booking, that means you're picking up
whatever work you can get.

Papa

Uh-huh, uh-huh.  And you?  You...?

Mama

Eh, Papa, please.  He's eating.  You can talk business later.

Papa

I'm sorry.

Jolson

It's all right, Mama.  It's true, I've been picking up a little time now
and then.  That's all.

Papa

	(to Mama)

Uh-huh.  You see?

Jolson

Now, but wait.  I could have had regular booking if I wanted it.

Mama

	(to Papa)

See?

Jolson

But I've had other ideas.  They sound a little crazy to anyone but me.

Ann

Like what, Asa?

Jolson

Well, like spending most of my time in hotel rooms with song-writers
whenever I met up with one.  Trying to make songs out of music I picked
up.  Music nobody ever heard of before but the only kind I want to sing.

Papa

Is this music so peculiar?

Jolson

You sing it all the time, Papa.

Papa

You want to sing prayers on the stage?

Jolson

No-no-no, just the feeling in prayers.  That's what's in the people I
got it from and that's what's in their music, even when it's fast and
happy.  But they tell me it won't go, Papa.  It's never been done.  In
fact I'll tell you a secret.  They say your son's a little crazy.

Papa

Well, Mama, our son is a little crazy.  But what can we do?  He is our
boy.  We have got to love him.  But about crazy people, Asa, it's --
it's very funny.  You see, once they prove they are right, they are
suddenly great people.

Ann smiles.

The phone rings.

Mama

I'll go.  Eat, Asa.

DOLLY BACK as Mama walks into the living room.

Baron

Got your home address from an agency.  It's about this, Al.  You

he paid me off if I'd stop singing.  That's how it happens I'm managing
the new Winter Garden Theater.  I've got you to thank for the whole
thing.  And look, my friend, we open in three weeks, and there's a spot
in the show for you if you want it!

Yeah... Yes, I heard you, Tom.  It's just a spot, but -- but Broadway! 
Except, tell me, Tom.  What do I do?  I mean, exactly what do I sing?

Baron

Well, I don't know.  Any one of the songs that's been written for the
show.

Jolson

Why can't I pick my own, Tom?... Well, not exactly my own.  I mean, it's
stuff I picked up.  Terrific songs.  They just need to be polished up by
somebody good in New York.  Wouldn't take more than a week.

IN BARON'S OFFICE

Baron

	(on the phone)

They're terrific but not written yet?!

Jolson

But what's the good, Tom, if it doesn't help the show and if I can't do
what I can do.  I don't care if it's the biggest show in the world!  I'd
rather pass it up!

Mama and Papa look at him, concerned.

Jolson

Let me bring the stuff on and help me get it into shape... Ya, you will?
 Ah, you're marvelous!... Yeah.  Why, I can leave right away.  I'll be
on that train in an hour!

Right, Tom.  The minute I get there!

Jolson hangs up and picks Mama up by the waist.

Look, about this part, Al.  It's nice of you to think of me.  But it

Sure, sure.  I realize that.  But you see, it's like this, Steve.  I've

Steve

Neither was lighting up the audience, or runways.

But why this Steve?

Steve

Because it's a brand new audience, he says.  Millions of 'em -- people
who never saw a Broadway show and never heard him sing.

Steve

Here's a laugh, Al.  Some boys at the club were saying, why don't you
give Sunday night concerts so actors and people in show business will
get a chance to see you perform.  How d'ya like that?

Jolson looks up enthralled.

Jolson

Why, it's the most exciting audience in the world!  That's a great idea!
 Make a note of it, Steve.  Tell Tom to arrange it!

Steve

Wait!  The minute we get back to New York, you wanna start right to work
on the new show.  Without even a day's rest!

Jolson

So what?

Steve

So pretty soon you're doin' eight performances a week again -- like
you've done steady for five years.  And now you want to add an extra
show on Sunday.

	(pointing at him)

That's a short-cut to the morgue.

Jolson

Sweetheart, what you like doing keeps you healthy.

Steve

Oh, I know you'd rather sing to a live face than eat.  But I call this
winding up with nothing for yourself.  I'm talking about some life
outside of a theater.

Jolson

	(looking up)

Like what?

Steve

Like slowing down a little and having some other kind of fun -- like a
family.  Like some girl.

Jolson

Don't worry, pal.  There's always been a girl.  Look, when do we play
Washington?

Steve

Two weeks.

Jolson

The night we open there, let's make it a real celebration.  Get a box
for Mama and Papa, and Ann Murray and her folks, and tell Papa to bring
the president.

Jolson makes a grand entrance dressed as a Spaniard riding on a flower
cart pulled by a donkey, and surrounded by dancing girls.

Jolson

	(singing out)

Hamburgers!  Hamburgers!  Hamburgers!

The chorus lifts Jolson atop the cart and he sings "THE SPANIARD THAT
BLIGHTED MY LIFE."

In the middle of the song he does a comedy bit with a flute player, who
keeps trying to make him sing higher.  Finally Jolson sings some
nonsense words with him then adds:

Jolson

One of us should have stayed home!

In the meantime, Steve, standing in the wings, looks up at the balcony
and sees Roy sitting with Ann.  A look of concern crosses Steve's face.

sings "Ole!"  The audience applauds.

Jolson

Well, how'd you like it?

Papa

When I sing in the synagogue, I never get applause like that.

Jolson

Papa, if you want to get ahead singing, you've got to have Steve manage
your affairs.

They all laugh.

Mama

Asa, you look thin.  You need a rest.

Steve looks back from a tray of hors d'oeuvres.

Steve

Rest?  There's a new show coming up, and now a performance every Sunday
night.

Mama

Sunday nights, too?

Jolson

By popular request, Mama.  Don't worry about it, honey.

Jolson walks over to greet Anne and Roy coming in through the doorway.

Ann

Al, it was marvelous.

Jolson

Gee, I'm glad to see you, Ann.

Glenn

We've been experimenting with talking picture for years.  We know it'll
work.  But we want a star in our first sound picture.

Steve

But why Al?

Glenn

Well, that's logical.  He's the biggest singing star in the country and
he's led the way in show business ever since he began.

Steve

So Al should risk his career on a newfangled invention like this.  What
if this thing is a flop?

Glenn

With Jolson, we don't think it will be.

Jolson enters through an archway with a VALET.

Steve

Even so, before Al goes into anything like this, he's gonna knock off
for a year and rest.

Jolson

Ha-hah!  How many people do you figure see a good movie, Mr. Glenn?

Glenn

Fifty million in this country alone.

Jolson

And the rest of the world besides, huh?  Never was an audience like that
in history, Steve.

The valet helps Jolson into his jacket and brushes it off.

Steve

That may be true, Al, but --

Jolson

It's an audience that never saw a live show.  People in small towns who
can afford a movie where they can't afford anything else.  An audience
of millions.  And I'd be singing to every one of them at the same time.

From O.S., music starts to play.

Jolson

That's really something!

Jolson

Tonight, folks, I'm only gonna sing two thousand songs -- one to a
customer.  I should live so long!

He tosses his coat and hat to someone in the orchestra.

Jolson

Hold this, will you, Henry?... Sorry I'm late tonight, folks, but we
were discussing a little business deal in the back of the house.  As a
matter of fact, I'm gonna tell ya about it right now.  Y'see, tomorrow I
leave for Hollywood.  I'm going into what they call "talking pictures." 
 Don't know what's gonna happen to me -- but if I want to come back,
you'll let me, won't you?

Jolson

Thanks, I'll remember that.  So this is a kind of a farewell.  If you
don't mind, I'll -- I'll sing till you ask me to stop!  You ain't heard

Julie sits thinking and glances at Ziegfeld.  Jolson steps onto the
runway.

Jolson

Miss Benson, what is your pleasure?

Julie

Julie watches with a smile.  When he finishes, the audience applauds and
Julie mimes the words to him, "Thank you."

Jolson waves to the audience, gestures goodwill to Julie then holds his
hands up for quiet.

Look, will you do me a big favor?

Julie

Jolson

Will you marry me, Miss Benson?

Julie

I'll do you a bigger favor, Mister Jolson.  I won't marry you.

Jolson

I didn't suppose you would, but you could think about it, huh?  Of
course, you'd have to decide tonight.  Y'see, I'm going to California
tomorrow.

Well, then, this last weekend belongs to your friends.

Jolson

Wait!  You mean in there?  Tell ya a secret.  Don't even know most of

Well, it always seems to happen.  Y'see, I ask a few people up, and then
they ask some people I never heard of, and those strangers ask some
other strangers, and before you know it...

Julie

... you're singing for them.

Jolson

Yeah -- just for three or four hours.

Julie

You mean you work till midnight and then you come home and work three or
four hours more?

Jolson

I don't mind.

Julie

You mean you love it.

Jolson

Yeah, I guess I do.  It's more than just singing.  I -- I don't know how
to tell you.  It's...

Julie

Well, you don't really have to, Mister Jolson.

Jolson

Oh, yes -- yes I do.  I gotta tell you everything!

Steve has just opened the balcony door.

Steve

Steve looks sourly at him then returns to the living room.

TWO-SHOT - JOLSON AND JULIE

She turns toward the door.

Julie

You really ought to go in, Mister Jolson.

Jolson

	 stopping her)

No.  I've got to tell you how I feel.  And it's gonna take me hours.  Of
course, I shouldn't be rushing you like this.  You'll think I'm kidding.
 But look.  Y'see, I've been waiting for something for a long time.  I
didn't know what it was.  Steve's been trying to tell me, it was about
-- well, about getting everything and nothing out of life.  I didn't
know what he was talking about, and then I saw you.  Yes sir, then I saw
you! -- Look, got a great idea.  Suppose you and I got married and went
to California together?  How about it?

Julie

Well, of course, I'm rehearsing "Show Girl" and we open in two weeks.

Jolson

Ah, yeah.  That's too bad.  If it just wasn't for that, huh?

And a few other things.

Jolson

Go ahead, tell me.  That's what I want to know.  Like what?

Well, that's the point, and -- It's yours, all right.  It's your whole
life, too.  But I don't think it'll ever be mine.

Jolson

Why, it's gonna say "Julie Benson" down there in great big lights.  Do
you mean to say you don't want that?

Julie

Oh, yes, I want that.  I'm just normal enough to want that.

Jolson

Sure.  You're just a little scared now.  Wait'll you get some
confidence!  You'll begin to love it, begin to feel it in your blood!

Julie

That's the big difference.

Jolson

What's the big difference?

Julie

It was in your blood when you were born.  But I'm just a pretty good
hoofer, and I got a lucky break.  All I know is, I -- I want a lot
besides this.

Jolson

Like what, Julie?  Gotta know.

Julie

Well, in the first place, like -- like a real home.

Jolson

Sure, everybody wants a home.

Julie

Nah, you wouldn't care for the kind I'm thinking of.

Jolson

Why not?  Why wouldn't I?

Julie

It would have to be far enough away -- maybe way out in the country --
so that by the time you got there, and closed the door, you'd have
forgotten all about show business.

Jolson

It's funny.  All of a sudden that's what I've always wanted, to close a
door.  I'll tell ya something, Julie.  I know just the spot.  It's up in
Westchester.  Acres of pretty land, trees all around.

Steve's voice interrupts them again:

JOLSON

Ah, you got nothing to be scared about, honey.  You're gonna be
wonderful... Yeah, I'm still at the studio, working hard.  We shoot
pretty soon... Oh, it's gonna be all right, I think, when I find out
which end of the camera's which... Listen, baby, get a good night's
sleep and don't worry, you hear?  You're gonna knock 'em dead!

WIDER ANGLE - JOLSON'S LIVING ROOM

A WIDER ANGLE reveals Jolson sitting on a couch and Steve sitting across
from him in a chair, reading a script.

Jolson

	(into phone)

Yeah, I'll call you again tomorrow night.  Goodbye, angel.

Jolson hangs up.

Steve

She all right?

Jolson

She says she's scared.  She sounds it. -- Steve, if I got a plane -- a
special plane to fly right through -- I could be in New York for that
opening tomorrow night.

Steve

What can you do in New York?

Jolson

I don't know, but I wanna be there.  Get on that phone, Steve!  Get the
plane!

DOLLY IN as they walk into Jolson's dressing room.

Steve

You can't walk out on the studio like this!

Jolson

Be back in two days and work twice as hard.

Steve

But Al...!

Jolson

	(taking his robe off)

Oh, and phone Ziegfeld.  Tell him to hold me a seat and not to tell
Julie I'm coming.

Jolson walks around a corner.  Steve paces back into the living room,
picks up a phone and starts to dial.

				DISSOLVE TO:

INT. A SPINNING PROGRAM COVER

It comes to a stop and reads:

"Florence Ziegfeld, Jr.

JULIE BENSON."

We hear a male chorus singing the opening bars of "LIZA."

				DISSOLVE TO:

INT. THEATER - NIGHT

Ziegfeld leads Jolson down an aisle to two vacant seats.  They sit
beside each other.  The chorus keeps singing.

LONG SHOT - THE STAGE

A dozen chorus men in blue suits point up at Julie, who stands, all in
gold, on the top step of a series of disks.

MEDIUM SHOT - JULIE

DOLLY IN tight as she holds her arms out.

IN THE AUDIENCE

Jolson leans forward, watching.

HIGH ANGLE ON THE DISKS

Julie starts dancing as the men start singing the chorus of "LIZA."

IN THE AUDIENCE

Jolson still leans forward.  Ziegfeld taps his arm to signal him to sit
back in his seat.

LONG SHOT - THE STAGE

Julie starts dancing down the series of disks.

ANGLE ON THE DISKS

Julie continues down three disks then makes a wrong turn and almost
falls.

MEDIUM SHOT _- JULIE

catches herself, frightened, and stops dancing.

IN THE AUDIENCE

Jolson watches anxiously.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT - JULIE

still hasn't caught her bearings.

IN THE AUDIENCE

Suddenly Jolson rises and starts to sing "LIZA" with the orchestra.

JULIE

hears him and happily resumes dancing.

When she reaches the bottom disk, she jumps into the air.  The men catch
her in a sitting position and bounce her to her feet; she twirls a few
times then poses grandly for the finish.

The audience applauds.

Julie blows Jolson a kiss as the curtains come down.

				DISSOLVE TO:

INT. JULIE'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

The entire room is full of flowers.  Julie walks in with her DRESSER and
does a double-take.

Jolson rises from a chair across from her.

Jolson

Hello, baby.

Julie

Hello, honey.

She goes to him and they embrace and kiss.

Papa

Asa!

Mama

	(to Julie)

I'm so -- I'm so happy, dear!

Papa

	(tapping Mama's shoulder)

Mama!  Mama, please.  Please give me a chance!

Mama moves over to hug Jolson while Papa hugs Julie.

				DISSOLVE TO:

INT. YOELSON DINING ROOM - NIGHT

The foursome -- Jolson, Mama, Julie and Papa -- sit at the table eating.

Mama

I don't understand.  Married a few hours, he runs to California --

Jolson

It'll just take me a couple of months to make this picture, Mama.  Then
I'll be home.

Julie

And that's where he's gonna stay.

[Papa leans forward and says something but there is no sound.  The next
shot starts with Jolson nodding in acknowledgement of what Papa said.]

Mama

Asa staying home?  That will be a miracle.

Papa

Julie, there's only one thing the matter with Asa.  He's got to sing. 
It's a wonderful thing.  Success is beautiful.  But Mama and I have
worried, because a home with love in it is even better.

Jolson

The way you say that is a little corny, Papa, but you're right.  Julie
agrees with you.  What do you think we're gonna do?  We're gonna build a
real home and settle down -- out in the country where it's nice and
quiet, nothing but crickets and frogs.

Julie

I'll teach the frogs to sing "Mammy" so Al won't be lonely.

The others laugh.

Jolson

Thank ya, honey.

Papa

Asa, are you serious?

Jolson

Sure.  In fact, Julie doesn't know this yet.  I've got an architect at
work.

Julie

Al!

Jolson

I told him, "Build a house for Julie.  The sky's the limit."

Papa

Well, that I approve of.

Mama

So do I.

	(she hands Julie a plate)

Here.  Here, have some gefilte fish with the horseradish, Julie.

Jolson

Look out for the horseradish, honey.  That stuff will curl your hair. --
Y'know, I think we'll have a barn Mama.  And some cows.  Gonna milk 'em
myself.

Papa

You?

Julie takes a forkful of gefilte fish and coats it in horseradish.

Mama

You milk cows, Asa?

Papa

You have to get up at five o'clock!

Julie

Well, we'll keep the cows up at night so they'll sleep later in the
morning.

Everyone laughs.  Julie takes the bite of gefilte fish.

Jolson

	(in a panic)

Julie, you've got too much!

She shakes her head then suddenly swallows and gags.

She covers her mouth with a napkin as Jolson hands her a glass of water.
 She drinks.

FADE IN:

VARIETY

A page turns to reveal an ad:

At the same time we hear an orchestra play the intro to "THERE'S A
RAINBOW 'ROUND MY SHOULDER."

				DISSOLVE TO:

INT. WINTER GARDEN THEATRE - NIGHT

The Jolson party sits in a box watching the movie (Jolson, Julie, Steve,
Mama, Papa and Glenn).  We never actually see the movie they're
watching.

We hear the "movie Jolson" start to sing the song.  Jolson starts
humming along in harmony with himself.

A GRUMPY man in the row behind them gets increasingly irritated and
finally blurts out:

Grumpy Man

Let Jolson sing it, mister.  He's doing all right.

Jolson

	(smiling back at him)

Think so?

Jolson stops singing but excitedly sways in his seat to the music.  When
the song ends, the audience around him applauds and he looks back at
them.

				DISSOLVE TO:

INT. JOLSON LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Baron sits at a grand piano reading a copy of Variety; Mama, Papa and
Julie surround the piano, all with their own copies.

Papa

	(reading aloud)

"'Jazz Singer' marks the end of silent pictures."

Mama

	(reading aloud)

"First talking picture sensation."

Papa

I have followed show business for many years, but I must say I have
never seen a thing like this.

Mama

Oh-ho, my expert.

Baron

I haven't seen anything like it either, Cantor.

Mama

	(looking at her watch)

Ooh, it's almost three o'clock.  Where's Asa?

Julie

Well, you know what a half-hour business talk is, Mama.  You should
really go to sleep.  Tom and I'll wait up for them.

Papa

Who can sleep on a night like this?

Jolson enters.  Steve follows.

Julie

Al!

She runs over and gives him a hug.

Jolson

	(embracing her)

Hello, everybody.  Gee, we didn't realize how late it was.

Papa

Asa, did you see the papers?

Jolson

Yeah, we saw them in Glenn's office.  They're -- they're really
something.

Papa

"Something," he says!

Jolson

	(to Julie)

I'm sorry, baby.  I wanted to celebrate tonight, but -- well, you see,
honey, we -- we got to talking about --

Julie

I know.  They want you to go right back to the Coast and make another
picture.

Jolson

How'd you know?

Steve

That was tough to figure out.

Jolson

Well, they argue this way.  This first talking picture will be a great
hit and it ought to be followed up with another one right away.

Julie

They're right, Al.  I think you ought to go.

Jolson

But that's the point, baby.  I'd have to go all by myself again.  You
can't leave your show in the middle of a run.

Papa watches them, aware a conflict is built into their relationship.

Julie

Well, we'll just have to wait a little while longer.

Baron

	(rising, concerned)

What happens to the new Winter Garden show?

Steve

That waits like Julie does.

Jolson

Yeah, Tom.  We'll talk about that later.

Mama

Wait a minute.  Julie will be here, Asa in California.  So where will
you build your house?  In Kansas City?

Jolson and Julie both laugh

Jolson

Don't worry, Mama.  We'll build it.

	(to Julie)

Ah, you're terrific to take it this way, baby.  It's another bad break,
but it won't be for long.

	(hugging her)

Ah, gee, then you'll get everything you want, angel.

	(backs up)

In fact, listen.  While I'm gone, you go ahead with the house, see?  Get
it ready.  Start building it and start teaching those frogs how to sing
"Mammy."

They both laugh and then they embrace and kiss.

Jolson shows Julie into the giant entrance hall.  Steve follows with
Glenn.  The hired staff look on (Henry the butler, Alice the maid, a
woman in black and a maid in black).

Jolson

Here we are, baby.  Home.  Ha-ha!  This is really something!

Steve

	(to Henry)

Hiya, Henry.

Jolson

	(to the others)

Oh, meet Misses Jolson.  Great to have her here, isn't it?

	(takes Julie's coat)

Here, baby.  Let me take this.

He tosses it to the woman in black.

Jolson

Let's, uh -- Oh, ya want something, baby?  Ya want to clean up?  Want
something to eat?  Henry will rustle up some grub for ya.

Julie

No, I don't want a thing.

Jolson

Come on, let's go inside then.  Come on, fellas.

PAN on them as they pass through an archway into the living room.

INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

Jolson and Julie enter followed by Steve and Glenn.

Jolson

Ah, it's been a long time, honey.  Here, wait a minute, let me look at
you.

He turns her by the shoulders and looks into her face.

Jolson

Never gonna let you out of my sight again.

Julie

Good for you.

They kiss.

Steve

	(to Glenn)

Sit down, Dick.  This may take a little time.

PAN on the party as Julie leads them further into the room.  A grand
piano comes into view near a large window.

Julie

	(looking around)

Hmm.  A little large, isn't it?

Jolson

Well, it -- it ain't exactly small.

Steve

Y'see, they used to play football here before they built the Coliseum.

The others laugh.

Jolson

Ah, no, honey.  You wouldn't care for a place like this, but don't let
it get you down.

Julie

Darling, since we don't have to stay here very long, I just love it.

Jolson

	(a forced laugh)

Yeah, that's right.  And yet, on the other hand, baby, y'know...

He turns her toward the couch.

Jolson

Come here.  Sit down.  Got something to tell ya.

Julie

	(sitting on the couch)

On the other hand, what?

Steve

On the other hand, he's talking through his hat!

	(catches himself)

		(MORE)

Steve (cont'd)

Oh, uh -- uh -- we had a little dinner planned, Julie, and --

Jolson

Forget it, Steve.  Forget what we arranged.  I can't wait, gotta tell
her now.

Jolson sits on the couch beside her.

Julie

What goes on here?

Jolson

Now, honey.  Talking pictures are here for good.  They're getting better
all the time.  In a couple of years, they'll have audiences nobody ever
dreamed about.  The studio's got terrific plans.  All I know is, a man
would have to be insane to walk away from this now.

Julie

Al, you went and did it.

Jolson

What?

Julie

You bought a house out here.

Jolson

No!

Julie

Or you're building one --

Jolson

No, no!

Julie

With sunken gardens.

Jolson

No!

Jolson gets up laughing.

Julie

That was the surprise you talked about.

Jolson

No, honest.

Steve

You ain't heard nothin' yet, Julie.

Jolson

You said it!

Jolson gets down on one knee.

Jolson

Now, baby.  Now, listen.

Julie

Al, are you gonna sing "Mammy?"

Jolson

Quit clownin'.  Look.  You don't think I'd ask you to give up the stage
and dancing and just have you come out here and settle down?

Julie

I might consider it.

Jolson

No, but I wouldn't let you do that.  You're too terrific.  In fact, do
you know what pictures need?  Talent, and something beautiful at the
same time, like you.

Julie

Whoa!  Wait a minute!

Jolson

Listen, show business is here now, baby.  You belong in it -- you and me
both.  And if we're together, who cares where we live?  The world's
gotta hear about you, honey.  Your name on billboards in ninety-seven
languages.  The greatest star pictures ever had!  You can't miss.

	(to Glenn)

Where's the document, Dick?  You didn't forget to bring it?

Glenn hands Jolson a blue-backed contract.

Glenn

It's right here.

Jolson

	(tapping Glenn's chest)

Your studio's about to own the biggest hunk of talent in the land.

	(to Julie)

Papa's been working on this contract for weeks, honey.

	(he sits beside her)

It's all ready to sign.

Steve

Wait a minute!  Julie hasn't said anything!

Julie

	(dumbfounded)

Well, I -- I can't think of anything.

Jolson

There you are.

Steve

Maybe she doesn't want her name in more than seventeen languages.  Or
maybe none.

Jolson

Julie, don't listen to this guy.  For weeks he's squawking about me
rushing you into this.

Steve

And Julie, this guy is out of his mind about pictures.  The latest type
of Jolson rocket has taken off.  I've been riding those dizzy things for
years.  It's all right with me, but maybe you had something a little
slower in mind.

Jolson

Baby, what's he talking about?

Julie

Haven't the faintest idea.

	(to Steve)

My dear Mister Martin, pictures need talent.  And what girl would take
seventeen languages when she can have ninety-seven?

	(starts to take her

	 gloves off)

Shall I sign this now, Mister Jolson?

Jolson laughs and gives her a hug and kiss.

Jolson

Thanks, Steve.  You talked her into it.  Here you are, baby.  Got a pen,
Dick?  We're gonna do this right now.

Steve looks at Julie.  She returns the look, then turns to Glenn.

Oh, no.  I like people, Steve.  I just wish sometimes there weren't so

Steve

Funny how they never get tired listening to him, night after night.

Julie

Not so funny.  He's a pretty remarkable fella.

The song on the radio ends to applause.

Steve

That he is.  Well, pretty soon now, you and Al will wash up these

Uh-hmm.  First we shake this town for points east.  Maybe farther east
than that -- across the Atlantic, who knows? -- Cream for you, Steve.

	(she adds cream to

	 his cup)

And when that's out of our system, there's a little matter of building
that house.

DOLLY BACK as Jolson sits on a couch across from Steve.  Julie hands
Steve his coffee and starts to pour a cup for herself.

Steve

That I gotta see if I never see another house in the world.

Jolson

Y'know, I kinda got a hankerin' to see it myself.

Julie

I'm glad to hear that, because I can have it up in no time.  I know
every room in the place.  I've even got it furnished.  Just one thing:
in our travels to find the right place to put that house.

Jolson

You, uh -- you don't mean the east, do ya, baby?

She almost responds but hesitates.

Steve

That was the original idea.  Why change it?

Jolson

We've gotten used to this country out here.  I like it.  I don't know,
it feels more like home than any place in the world.  And it doesn't
matter too much to you, does it, sweetheart?

Julie

	(a pause)

No, not really.  And if it does to you, Al...

Jolson

Well, don't put it that way, honey.  There's nothing so special you want
in the east, is there?

Julie

Well, no.  That's true.  That settles it.  It's going to be here.

Jolson

Wonderful.

Julie

	(to Steve)

And you keep quiet.

Jolson sits on the couch again.  Julie sits beside him.

Julie

Only, Al... we could get out in the country a little way, couldn't we?

Jolson

Sure, why not?

Julie

Thanks.

	(kisses his cheek)

That's all I wanted.

Steve

With no number on the house and a couple of vicious dogs in the yard,
you can keep the callers down to practically nothing.

Jolson laughs.

Steve

Well, this is Friday.  What about train tickets out of here, say,
Sunday?

Julie

I can be ready tomorrow, but Sunday will have to do.

Jolson

Hey, what's the rush?  Let's give ourselves a little time.  Let's say a
week or so.

Julie

What will we want with a week or so?

Jolson

No kidding.  A week would wrap up everything fine for me.

Julie

What have you got to wrap up?

Steve

	(rising)

Nothing.  He just thinks he has.  Nothing important at all.

	(to Jolson, quickly)

Have a cup of coffee, Al.  It's great.

Julie

Look, boys, is something cooking?

Steve

No, there's nothing cooking.

Jolson

No, Baby, it was just an idea, that's all.  There's a proposition come
at us about putting a company together and making our own pictures.  And
--

Steve, looking over Julie's shoulder, waves to Jolson to be quiet.

Jolson

	(adding quickly)

Oh, nothing definite, just talking about it.  Of course, in a week or
so, it could gel.  It might be a pretty exciting thing to come back to. 
And, well -- that's all it was.

Julie

	(holding his arm)

Sorry, darling.  No gelling.  First thing you know, you've set a date to
make a picture.  Then we'll have to travel with one eye on the
calendarš--

Jolson

I promise you, baby.

Julie

Or something just as bad: talking about a picture all the time we're
gone.

Jolson

No, sir.  Not a peep.  Give you my word.

Julie

Fine, darling.  But -- well, I know this is silly, but it's -- it's
gotten to be a sort of principle.  Once we do say we're going to quit
for a while --

Jolson

Oh, who said we weren't?

Julie

Well, then whatever this proposition is, it'll still be there in three
months, or six months --

Steve

And just as hot, so why bother now?  Why don't you lay off, Al?

Jolson

	(paces away)

Wow!  What a beating I'm taking here!

	(turns back)

But look, honey.  Remember me?  This is Jolson.  I go with the principle
every time.  But all I'm talking about is a couple of days!

Julie

But when you want to spend them that way, Al, that's where the principle
is!  It isn't the days.

		(MORE)

Julie (cont'd)

It doesn't have anything to do with time.

	(crying)

If you can't see that, Al, I wouldn't know how to --

	(wipes her eyes)

Holy smoke, this is a kid stunt, isn't it?

Jolson looks at her amazed.

Julie

I'll be right back.

Julie runs off.

IN THE DOORWAY

Julie opens the door to the entrance hall and hurries out of view.

IN THE LIVING ROOM

Jolson

First time I ever saw Julie cry.   Must be something wrong with me, I
guess, Steve, huh?

Steve

Yeah.  Has been for a long time.

Jolson gives Steve a hard look then walks off.

INT. JULIE'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

She sits in front of a mirror crying.  In the mirror we see Jolson
opening the door behind her and entering.  He takes a few steps toward
her.

Julie

Al, you're going to hate to stop work and go away, aren't you?

Jolson

No, baby.

Julie

It's going to be awfully tough, isn't it?  Not singing always is.  And
here I am asking you to go away without any plans, without even any work
to come back to.

Jolson

Honest, it doesn't matter that much, baby.  You know how it is when an
old fire horse hears the bell.

Julie

I didn't say it was your fault.

	(rises and faces him)

That's not what I'm trying to say.  What we've got to discuss is you and
me.

Jolson

Julie --

Julie

Please, Al, just listen hard for once, will you?

	(she turns away)

You see, I'm like somebody with one desperate chance left.  I couldn't
go on this way if I wanted to.  That means you'd have to change.  You'd
have to get off this merry-go-round and quit for once, for a long time. 
And I know you'd make promises and try to keep them.  But I'd know how
you felt.  And I couldn't have any happiness out of wishing the tiniest
misery on you.  So you see, Al, any way you look at it, there's got to
be misery for both of us.  And the way we feel about each other, and
rather than let that die a slow, painful death, I think we ought to have
the courage to quit now.

Jolson

That's the one thing that can't happen, baby.

Julie

	(turns to him)

Be honest, Al.

Jolson

I never understood a thing.

She walks past him.  He speaks to her from behind.

Jolson

Look, Julie.  You've heard of fellas who hit the bottle and wind up
hopeless drunks.  Well, whatever drives me that way and won't let me
understand, it's the same thing.  I've been like a fella who's been
drunk all his life.  And you know, a guy like that'll get so bad he'll
pass up the thing he wants more than anything else in the world.

Julie

You don't have to tell me how you feel about me, Al.  I know that.

Jolson

No, listen, baby.  I do have to tell you because, listen.  I've been
kicked around in my time.  I thought I could take anything.  But having
you say you want to quit because -- Well, look, baby.  If it means
losing you, it isn't even a contest.  I don't want any part of any more
contracts, or shows, or any singing in the world.

Julie

Al, you can't make me a gift of your whole life.  I just couldn't take
it.

Jolson

No, look, baby.  It's given you nothing, except this show business, and
that's cheated me all my life.  It stands to cheat me right now, because
I know what would happen.  I'd just go on the same way, working my head
off, living everybody's life but my own, and at the same time lose the
only thing I was lucky to get out of it.  I know what you're thinking,
baby.  I'm kidding myself and don't know it.  Well, maybe yes.  I -- I
don't know.  When you've been like I have all my life like a drunk, you
can't quit all of a sudden.  Sometimes you crave the stuff.

DOLLY IN closer as he turns her around.

Jolson

But I am sober now, baby.  And I want you to help me.  If I start
yelling, hit me over the head, tie me down.  Because when you go, baby,
I got nothing left.  So be a pal, Julie.  Do what I ask you.

He hugs her tightly.

A car drives up the road to a ranch house.

				DISSOLVE TO:

INT. JOLSON'S ENCINO HOME - DAY

Jolson carries Julie in over the threshold.  Henry holds the door open
for him.  Alice stands nearby.

Jolson

Hello, Henry.

Henry

Sir, welcome.

Steve follows them inside and Henry closes the door.

Jolson

	(looking around)

Honey, it's a miracle!  Why, it fell from heaven.

Julie

Hey, you're over the threshold, you fool.  Put me down.

Laughing, Jolson sets her down.

Steve

It's a sensational job, Julie.

Julie

Thank you, boys.  Thank you.

	(turns back to the

	 servants)

Oh, Alice, Henry, the house looks beautiful.  You've done a wonderful
job.  But, look, you've worked hard enough now.  So why don't you take
the rest of the day off?

Jolson

Yeah, that's right.  Go ahead.

Julie

And don't worry about dinner.  We'll get a snack straight out of the
kitchen.

Jolson

Kitchen snack.  That's for me.

Henry

Shall I take the bag up now?

Julie

No-no-no, don't worry about it.  We'll take care of it.

Jolson

Yeah, so long, Henry.  Have a good time.

Henry and Alice exit out a back door (presumably to the servant's
quarters).  Meanwhile Jolson notices a checkers table and claps his
hands together.

Jolson

Wow!  Checkers.

	(heads for the table)

I used to be a champ back in Washington.  Come on, honey, I'll play you
a game.

Julie

Okay!

They sit at the table.  Steve looks on cantankerously.

Steve

Checkers?  Now?  You just came in!  How about unpacking?!

Jolson

Ah, we got months to unpack!

Julie

Months!

Steve shrugs and turns away.  Meanwhile Jolson notices the fireplace.

Jolson

Hey, wood and everything!  I'll light a fire.

	(walks to the fireplace)

We'll play right over here, nice and cozy.

Steve

It's not cold enough for a fire!

Jolson strikes a match and lights some kindling.

Julie

If he wants to light a fire in his own home, he certainly can.

Jolson

That's telling him, baby!  Honey, move that lamp off.  We'll bring the
table right up here.  Steve, get this one out of the way.

Steve

	(reaching for the table)

What'll I do with it?

Jolson

Put it anyplace.

Steve picks up the coffee table.  Just then the phone rings.

Julie

Oh, get that, will ya, Steve?

Steve stops and looks around.

Julie

In the library.

She points off to the side.  Steve turns back to put the table down
where he found it and bumps into Jolson.

Jolson

Put it there. -- Steve, the phone!  The phone!

Steve sets the table down and walks off.  Jolson and Julie move the
checkers table over to the fire.

Jolson

Huh-huh!  Let's take that telephone out, Julie, huh?

Julie

Don't be silly.  We've got to have a telephone.

Jolson

	(pulling up a chair)

Why?  People got along without them for thousands of years.  Anybody
wants to get in touch with us, let 'em do it by carrier pigeon.

Julie pulls her chair up.  Jolson laughs and kisses her lips.

Jolson

We've retired, sweetheart.  Come on, sit down.  I'll play you for, uh --
I'll play you for who's going to be boss in the house.

They both sit at the table.

Steve walks in from the library.

Steve

It's Dick Glenn, the studio.

Jolson

Not here.

Steve

He wants to wish you luck in the new home.

Jolson

Tell him thanks. -- Oh, and Steve, if the studio has this telephone
number, change it.

	(he moves a white piece)

Your move, baby.

Steve goes back into the library.

WIDER ANGLE - TAKING IN THE FIREPLACE

Julie moves a black piece.

Julie

Big fire, isn't it?

Jolson

Yeah, it sure is.

	(feeling the heat)

Uh, want to move this way a little bit, baby?

Julie

All right.

They move the table further from the fireplace.  Steve walks back in and
looks at the table.

Julie

Cozy, huh, Steve?

Steve

	(unbuttons his coat and

	 fans himself with it)

For a Turkish bath, it's very nice.

Jolson

Uh, is it a little warm in here, baby?

Julie

It is, a little.

Jolson

	(putting his hands

	 under the table)

Hmm?

He and Julie move the table still further from the fireplace.  Steve
continues fanning himself, then looks down at them in consternation.

Steve

There's nothing like a five-alarm fire on a nice spring day.

Julie

	(to Jolson)

You know, darling, I never wanted this table in the living room.  It
should be in the library.  It's much cozier in there.

Jolson

You want to move in there now, honey?

Julie

Yeah, let's.

Jolson and Julie pick up the table.

Jolson

We'll be with you in a minute, Steve.  Just sit down and relax.  It's
your home, too, y'know.

They walk off with the table.  Steve looks back at the fire that now
burns only for him.  He takes off his jacket, undoes his tie and sinks
back in a chair.

New Zealand.  "Go Into Your Dance" was playing there lately.  Hmm,
funny.  Still hearing from places like that after all this time.

DOLLY BACK to reveal Steve seated in a chair across from him reading a
script.

Steve

It's the fan letters from China I like to read.

Jolson

Where's Julie?

Steve

She'll be back.

Jolson

For lunch?

Steve

That's what she said.

Jolson

Well, where'd she go?

Steve

Into town.  I don't know.

Jolson

Well, why didn't she tell me?  I could have gone along for the ride.

Steve

Your folks' wedding anniversary tomorrow.  You'll phone 'em, huh?

Jolson

Yeah.  I wish we'd have gone east and celebrated.

Steve

Julie wanted to go and you said "no."

Jolson

I know.  I just didn't feel like it then.  We should have brought the
folks out to California for their anniversary this year.  We talk about
doing it every year, and never do.  It would have been nice.

Steve nods.  Jolson gets up and paces across the patio.

Jolson

Ah, I wish Julie had told me where she was going.

Steve

She'll be here in a little while.  Look, Al...

Steve gets up and approaches him.

Steve

This manuscript of Baron's new show.  Do you want to change your mind
and read it, or shall I send it back?

Jolson

	(impatient)

I don't know.  Better send it back.

Steve

He's wired about it twice.

Jolson

Well, why doesn't he stop wiring?  We've told him fifty times in this
last year I'm not interested in any shows.

Steve

Wait a minute, Al.  Tom knows that.  All he wants is your opinion, and
any ideas you might have.

Jolson

	(glances at the script)

Well, tell him I'm sorry, Steve.  I don't want to read it.  Haven't the
patience.

Steve turns away.

Just then Julie steps out onto the patio.

Julie

Hello, Al.

JOLSON

stops and turns, smiling.

There she is --

He suddenly freezes.

This is the life.  You know, Mama, if I tried, I could get used to this.

The others laugh.

Jolson

You go right ahead and try, Papa.

Henry returns with a tray and serves some food to Mama.

Julie

That's right.  You and Mama ought to move out here.

A doorbell rings.

Julie

Henry, will you see who that is, please?

Henry nods and leaves the table.

Julie

You know, we've got acres of land.  We'll build you a house right next
door.

Mama

Next door?  And how would Papa get to a synagogue on the Sabbath?

Papa

You know, on the Sabbath, you mustn't ride.

Al!  You look wonderful!

Jolson

Hello, Tom.  When did you arrive?

Baron

Just flew in.  I had no idea I'd find the whole family here.

Jolson

You lost no time finding me.

Baron

Well, that's right.  Naturally --

Jolson

Well, you wasted a trip, Tom.  You can turn around and go back.  I'm not
interested in your show.  Don't want to read it.  Steve's told you that,
hasn't he?

Julie looks on alarmed.

Steve

Al, wait a second!

Jolson

I've quit.  I've worked enough.  Yes, and for you in my time, too.  And
busting out here like this'll get you nothing.

Julie

Al, what's the matter with you?!

Jolson catches himself.

Baron

You happen to be wrong, Al.  You see, to cast a Broadway show these
days, you have to come to Hollywood to find the actors.  I can't imagine
coming out here and not saying hello to you after quite a few years
together.

Jolson is remorseful now.

Julie

Of course.  Tom, you'll have lunch with us, won't you?

Baron

Well, Julie, I'd love to, but as a matter of fact --

Jolson takes his arm.

Jolson

As a matter of fact, we wouldn't think of letting you go.  Henry, set
Mister Baron up here.  Move over, Steve.

Julie looks on, relieved.  Jolson pulls an extra chair up to the table.

Jolson

Come here, Tom.  Sit down.

Tom sits at the table.

Jolson

Look, pal.  Look, everybody.  There was a crazy fella here a minute ago,
but I think he's gone now.  You can relax.

Mama and Papa look relieved.

How long are you staying, Tom?

Baron

I'm flying back late tomorrow night.

Jolson

Julie, Mama and Papa have the guest room, but there's a studio bed in

Baron

No, I really --

Julie

That's settled.  And tomorrow night you will attend the wedding
anniversary dinner of Cantor and Misses Yoelson.

Baron

Oh, I wouldn't miss that for anything.  But about tonight, I've got a
hotel room.

Jolson

Sorry, you're staying here, my boy.  And look, son.  Gonna read that
little show of yours tomorrow.  Yes sir, I'm gonna give it Mister
Jolson's personal attention and advice.  And tomorrow night -- Mama,
what do you say to our having the dinner party right out here?  What do

Jolson

I got a kick out of working on it.  Like old times.  It happens to be
good.  In fact, y'know, if I ever had any idea of going back to the old
grind, it's the kind of a show I'd want.  Not that I have any such idea,
Tom.  Matter of fact, I -- I couldn't stand it.

Baron

What do you mean?

Jolson

Well, a show's a big job.  You gotta be up to it.  Look at me.  Laying
off for a long time like this.  The pipes not what they used to be. 
I'll tell you something you never knew.  Every opening night of my life,
I used to have knots right in here.

Steve

Not bad.  He gave Tom some good ideas this afternoon.

Julie goes around the room cleaning out ashtrays.

Mama

Julie, make him sing tonight.

Julie

I'm afraid we won't have any more luck than we had last night, Mama. 
He'll play records again, but that's all.

Papa

Well, I can understand.  He has sung enough.  Let the records sing for a
change.

Steve

Nice idea, Cantor.

Julie

Speaking of change, Papa, do you think it's been good for Al?

Papa

Good?  How do you mean?

Julie

I mean, does he seem happy to you?

Papa

Well, of course.

Julie

Exactly like he used to be?

A little more settled, maybe.  After all, it's time.  He's no boy any
more.

Good.  I'll break this up.

Jolson emerges slapping his hands together.

Jolson

Papa rises.

Papa

Thank you, Mister Martin.  Thank you.  That was very beautiful.  In fact
--

	(he feels his head)

Ooh.  That wine was very good, Mama. -- I mean, what you said before,
about the spirit, Mister Martin.  By a strange coincidence, we actually
said something just like that the night of our wedding...

	(he strokes Mama's cheek)

... while Mama and I were dancing.  I said, let's always dance.  Oh, and
how we danced that wedding night.  Asa -- Asa, you should have seen us.
-- Oh, oh, I remember, you couldn't be there.

The others burst out laughing.

Papa

Anyhow, I -- I thank you.  I thank you all.

Ah, that was very good, Papa.  Very good.

Papa lifts his glass and starts to hum "THE ANNIVERSARY SONG."

Papa

Remember that, Asa?

Jolson

I've heard you sing it a thousand times, Papa.

Papa

That was the waltz at our wedding.  Come on, Asa.  Come on, sing with
me.

Julie looks from Papa to Jolson, certain he won't sing.

Jolson

No, you go ahead, Papa.

Papa

Oh, ho.  Listen to this.

Julie looks back at Papa.

Papa

As a little boy, he used to sing with me at the synagogue.  Well, what's
the matter?  Too -- too big a man now, huh?

Jolson looks down.  Julie looks at Jolson again.  Her expression almost
asks him to sing.

Papa

Mama, mama, tell me the truth.  Who was always a better singer, me or
Asa?

She winks at Jolson then turns back to Papa.

Mama

You, of course, Papa.

Papa

Uh-huh.

	(to Jolson)

Do you hear that?  Ah, come on.  Please.

Papa hums the "ANNIVERSARY SONG" again.  Jolson joins in, harmonizing
with him.

Papa gestures to Mama to dance with him.  She shakes her head at first,
then gets up with him.  Julie looks on as they begin to dance.

Then Jolson starts to sing the chorus.  Julie looks at him surprised. 
Jolson keeps singing.  Steve looks at him with a trace of sadness.

Mama and Papa continue to dance.

In the middle of the song, Jolson raises his emotional and volume level.
 Julie gives Steve a concerned look as if asking if Jolson really wants
to quit singing.  Steve avoids her glance and looks at Jolson.

Jolson continues singing.  Julie gives Steve another look, but Steve can
only look back with a poker face.

Mama and Papa continue dancing.  Jolson finishes the song and looks down
thoughtfully.

Julie also looks down, concerned.

Jolson picks up a drink.

Jolson

Well, that's that.

Mama and Papa look back at him.

Papa

Thank you, Asa.  That was very nice.

They return to their seats.  Steve watches them.  Everyone is quiet. 
Steve breaks the ice.

Steve

Cantor, you two have a fine dancing act there.

Papa

Do you think we could pick up a little time?

The others laugh.

Steve

I can book you solid for the season.

Baron

Oh, it was a beautiful party, Julie.  You know, I'd like to take over
from here on.  Suppose we drive into town and you all be my guests at a
nightclub.  What do you say?

Jolson looks down, not liking the idea.  Julie looks at the others
uncertain what to think.

Mama

Nightclub?  Now?

Baron

Yes.  We can see an early floor show and I can catch my plane.

Jolson

No, let's not.

Baron

Why?

Jolson

Well, I haven't been in one of those spots in years.

Julie looks at him searchingly.

Jolson

You see, we're just country folks, Tom.  We don't go for that fast life.
 And anyway, Mama and Papa wouldn't be interested in a nightclub.

Papa

Yes, yes.

Mama

Yes, we would.

The others laugh.

Baron

Well, there you are.  And it's not your anniversary, son.  It's theirs. 
Come on, let's go.

DOLLY BACK as they all get up from the table.

				DISSOLVE TO:

INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

A floor show is underway featuring a big band and dancing girls.

AT A CORNER TABLE

A MAITRE 'D shows the Jolson party to a corner table, where they all sit
down -- except Papa, who remains on his feet looking at the dancing
girls.

The girls shake and twirl on the floor.

Mama tugs on Papa's coat sleeve and he finally sits, still watching.

IN THE WINGS

The maitre 'd runs up excitedly behind the manager (EDDIE), taps his
shoulder and talks animatedly while motioning toward Jolson's table.

Eddie smiles broadly.  He walks over to the BANDLEADER, cups a hand over
the microphone and whispers to him.

The bandleader keeps conducting but turns to say something to the band.

AT THE TABLE

Mama

	(to Papa)

In all your years in show business, Papa, you didn't see anything like
this yet.

Papa

Oh, no.

He laughs and pats her hand.

ONSTAGE

The dancers finish with a flourish and run into the wings to applause. 
The band plays a brief coda of exit music.

Then Eddie gets on the microphone.

Eddie

Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to interrupt the show to make an
announcement.  We have a celebrity with us, a man you've enjoyed and
admired for many years.

Jolson looks the other way and lights a cigarette.

Eddie

He's been away for a long time and we've missed him a lot.  But he still
is the greatest entertainer of them all.

Baron

Wonder who he means.

Eddie

It's an honor to introduce...

The band plays the intro to "MY MAMMY."  Jolson steams and looks at
Julie.  She looks back serenely.

Eddie

That's right, folks!  It's "Mammy!"  And the man who made it famous --
the one and only Al Jolson!

The crowd applauds.  A spotlight lands on Jolson.  He politely rises,
nods to the crowd and sits down.

Jolson

The idiot.

Julie looks on with an enigmatic smile and fingers a string of pearls
around her neck.  Steve, concerned, looks at Julie then at Jolson.

Eddie

And there's a chance in a thousand if we ask him hard enough, just for
old times' sake, Mister Jolson might give us a song!

Jolson

This guy's crazy.

The crowd applauds and cheers.  Someone yells out, "Come on, Al!"

Jolson tries to wave them off.

Jolson

Sorry, no.

The applause continues and the spotlight remains on him.

Baron

They're not going to stop.  Better do it and get it over with.

Jolson looks at the audience then back at Julie.

Jolson

Baby, it looks like I'm not going to get out of this.  I'm sorry.

Julie grins and looks around at the audience.

Jolson stubs out his cigarette, rises and walks through the cheering
crowd to the stage.  The spotlight follows him all the way.  Eddie sets
down a microphone stand for him.

Jolson

Thanks, Eddie.  Thank you, boys.  That was a big introduction.

	(indicating the mic)

Just talk into this?

	(addressing the crowd)

Thank you, folks.  It's -- it's nice to be remembered.  I can't tell ya
how nice.  But, about singing for you, y'see, I'm a little rusty.  But
-- well, you asked for it, so we'll just make it a quick one, huh?

	(to Eddie)

What'll the boys handle that I can sing?

Eddie

Anything.

Jolson

	(calling back to the

	 band)

"Robert E. Lee!"

	(hands the mic stand

	 to Eddie)

I don't think I'll need this, Eddie.

Eddie walks off with the mic stand.

The band plays the intro to "WAITING FOR THE ROBERT E. LEE."  Julie
looks on still with an enigmatic smile and fingering her pearls.  Jolson
sings the song full throttle.

Papa smiles and sways to the music.  Julie maintains the enigmatic smile
and keeps fingering her pearls.

At the end, the entire Jolson party joins the audience in applauding.

Baron

Great!

Jolson waves to the audience and walks away from the stage.

Suddenly the crowd jumps to their feet, blocking his path and calling,
"More, more, more!"

Jolson tries to work his way through but the crowd holds him back.

AT THE TABLE

Everyone but Baron look on concerned.

Steve

	(rising)

They'll mob him!

Papa casts a wistful look over the top of his eyeglasses at Julie.  She
maintains her enigmatic smile, glancing from side to side.

NEAR THE STAGE

Jolson finally gives in.

Jolson

	(nodding)

Oh, all right!  All right!

He backs up toward the stage.

AT THE TABLE

Julie suddenly lowers her hands from her necklace, concerned.  Papa
looks at her with concern, then at Jolson.

ONSTAGE

Jolson goes to the stage and waves to the wings.

Jolson

Come on out, gang!  Everybody!  Everybody in the show, come on out and
sit down!

The dancers come out and sit on steps leading up to the band.

Jolson

You know, you work hard every night.  You must be tired of doing this
show.  Just sit down and I'll take over for you tonight.

STEVE

Unsmiling, he looks over at Julie then back at the stage.

ONSTAGE

Jolson

Haven't worked in a long time.  Just gather around, make yourselves
comfortable.  You ain't heard nothin' yet!

JULIE

looks at Jolson and quietly nods, as if finally realizing where they
stand.

ONSTAGE

Jolson

You pick it, Professor.  What'll it be?

The band plays the introduction to "ROCK-A-BYE YOUR BABY WITH A DIXIE
MELODY."

Jolson

Ah-ha!  "Rock-a-Bye!"  Yes sir, I think I remember that one.

Jolson sings "ROCK-A-BYE," thoroughly enjoying himself.

AT THE TABLE

Mama, Papa and Julie look on.  Julie has one hand on the table and with
the other keeps fingering her pearls.  Papa glances at Julie again over
the top of his glasses.

CLOSE-UP - JULIE

Now she holds both hands clasped at her throat.

Julie

You see, what he didn't have at home, Mama, was an audience.  Live
faces.  Isn't that it, Steve?

WIDER ANGLE ON THE TABLE

Steve looks at Julie with a poker face.  She looks again at the stage,
still with the enigmatic smile and fingering her pearls.

ONSTAGE

As Jolson sings on, FADE IN a SUPERIMPOSITION of a PAN across the
audience.  Each patron looks on happily.  Then FADE OUT the super.  The
song continues.

AT THE TABLE

Julie quietly shakes her head as she watches.  Papa glances at her sadly
over his glasses.

Julie

You see, Papa, Al was sure he didn't want to sing any more.  He wanted
to be with me.  I think I let him make the wrong decision.

Steve

I don't get this, Julie.

Papa looks sadly at Julie again.

Julie

I think Papa does.

Papa casts his eyes downward.

ONSTAGE

Jolson finishes the song to a tremendous ovation.  He steps back waving
to the audience.  Voices call out for another song:  "April Showers."

AT THE TABLE

Julie, still smiling enigmatically, looks at Jolson then around at the
audience.

ONSTAGE

Jolson

	(to the conductor)

You heard them, Professor.

AT THE TABLE

As a piano plays the intro to "APRIL SHOWERS," Steve looks over at
Julie.  She keeps looking at Jolson.

ONSTAGE

Jolson starts to sing.

AT THE TABLE

Steve looks at Julie again.  Her gaze remains on Jolson.

ONSTAGE

Jolson continues to sing.

CLOSE SHOT - JULIE

She sighs deeply, appearing close to tears.

Julie

Excuse me.

She gets up.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT - PAPA

looks up at her sadly.

MEDIUM LONG SHOT - THE TABLE

Julie pats Papa on the shoulder, grabs her coat and heads down a
corridor toward the foyer.

ONSTAGE

Jolson continues to sing.

IN THE CORRIDOR

DOLLY BACK on Julie walking.  Steve rises from the table in b.g. and
runs after her.  PAN on her as she heads for the entrance.

Steve

Julie!

She pauses.  He turns her gently by the shoulders to face him.

Steve

Where do you think you're going?

ANGLE ON JULIE OVER STEVE'S SHOULDER

Julie

Home.  Throw some things in the car.  I'll be gone by the time he gets
back.

Steve

Don't do that, Julie.

Julie

He tried awfully hard, Steve.  But you and I know: he's got to do that.

Steve

Now, wait!

Julie

See that he's on that plane with Tom tonight.  They'll do a great show.

Steve

Y'know, this is gonna kill him, Julie.

Julie

It isn't going to be so good for me, either.  But look.  When did you
last see him as happy as that?

Steve looks back over his shoulder.

MEDIUM SHOT - JOLSON

continues to sing.

TIGHT TWO-SHOT - STEVE AND JULIE

She touches his arm.

Julie

And, Steve, when he gets home nights after the show, don't let him sing
too long.

WIDER ANGLE

She kisses him on the cheek and turns away.  PAN on her and DOLLY IN as
she walks toward the entrance.  She stops in an archway to the foyer,
takes a last look back, then walks to the door.

A DOORMAN opens it.  She walks out and he follows, shutting the door
behind them.

MEDIUM SHOT - THE STAGE

CRANE BACK to a high, wide angle as Jolson sings the last line of the
song.

				FADE OUT.
