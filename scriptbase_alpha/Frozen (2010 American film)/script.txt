    EXT. MOUNT HOLLISTON - DAY                                    1
    Peace.

    Fresh snow glistens in the sunlight and reflects off of the
    giant pine trees covering the serene mountain side.

    It's quiet.

    So quiet.

                                                   HARD CUT TO:

                                   FROZEN

                                                   HARD CUT TO:




2   EXT. THE CHAIR LIFT - DAY                                     2
    Tight on a gloved hand as a lever is released.

    Tight on the cables at the top of a rickety chair lift as
    they kick into motion.

    Wider as an empty chair swivels around and beneath the asses
    of a threesome of SKIERS.

    Even wider to reveal a long line of Skiers and SNOWBOARDERS
    awaiting their moment to step up to the chair.



    The camera finds a group of three standing off to the side of
    the line, decked out in their winter gear.



3   EXT. SNOW BANK OVERLOOKING THE CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS        3

    Angle on DAN WALKER (college age, shaggy hair, holding a
    snowboard and a helmet in one hand) as he studies the
    situation. Next to him stands an impatient JOE LYNCH
    (college age, goggles on his head and a face full of fresh
    stubble, standing on skis).

                          LYNCH
                I don't see her.

                          DAN
                The shift change is late.   Just
                wait.

    PARKER O'NEIL (college age, red hair, holding a snowboard)
    sighs and stares back at the lift lane.
                                                          2.



                    PARKER
          Are you sure about this?

                    DAN
          We've been doing this forever.
          Trust me. This lady loves Lynch.
          She always goes for it.



Lynch smiles at Parker.

                      LYNCH
          I'm cute.


Just then, JASON (a ski mountain employee) approaches the
front of the line and excuses the employee working the chair.

                    PARKER
          Is um... is that her?

                      DAN
          Shit.

                      LYNCH
          Dude.

                    DAN
          It's cool, it's cool.
              (to Parker)
          Look, all you have to do is smile
          real pretty and tell him-


                     PARKER
          -What?   Me? No way.    This is your
          thing.

                    DAN

         Parker, listen, listen. It's so
          easy. All you do is tell the guy
          that you and your friends-

                    LYNCH
          -GIRLfriends. Say "girlfriends".

                    DAN
          -you and your girlfriends forgot
          your credit card and you can't pick
          up your lift tickets.


He grabs a wad of cash out of Lynch's glove and shoves it in
Parker's hand.
                                                                 3.



                        DAN (cont'd)
              Start at $50. That's what we
              usually give the other lady. He'll
              take it. Trust me.

                         PARKER
              Dan, no.   You do it.    I feel
              stupid.

                        DAN
              You've got this.    You can totally
              do this.


                        LYNCH
              Parker, you've so got this.

                        DAN
              The worst thing that happens is he
              says no. He won't say no. No one
              ever says no.

                         PARKER
              Why me?

                        LYNCH
              `Cause you're a girl.

                         DAN
              A very beautiful girl with a very
              charming smile.
                  (then)

              Just...

    He unzips her jacket a little bit, showing some more of her
    body.


                         DAN (cont'd)
              There.

                        PARKER
              My charming smile?

    Dan and Lynch smile back at her.    She exits reluctantly
    towards the lift line.


4   EXT. CHAIR LIFT LINE - CONTINUOUS                                4
    Parker pushes her snowboard forward and moves up the side of
    the line, passing all of the skiers who are waiting.

    She approaches Jason who is now running the lift.    He lights
    a cigarette.
                                                           4.



                      PARKER
          Hey.

Jason looks up at her.

                    PARKER (cont'd)
          Could I bum a smoke?



She flashes an adorable but forced smile and he quickly
obliges with a cigarette.

                      PARKER (cont'd)
          Thanks.

He lights her cigarette.

                    PARKER (cont'd)
          I'm Parker.

He looks around, not all that sure why a cute girl is talking
to him for more than just to get a smoke.

                      JASON
          Jason.

                      PARKER
          Oh, cool.    My brother's name is
          Jason.

                      JASON
          OK.

                    PARKER
          Yeah, so I don't want to waste your
          time and bullshit you cause you
          seem like a wicked busy guy and
          everything...but..this is gonna
          sound so stupid...

Jason is all ears.

                    PARKER (cont'd)
          My girlfriends and I drove all the
          way up here from Salem State, and I
          was sort of the dumbass who told
          everyone that I could cover the
          lift tickets on my Mom's credit
          card...but then I left her credit
          card at the gas station...and so...

Jason totally sees where this is going.
                                                              5.



                          JASON
              Right.

                        PARKER
              No- but I mean, we totally have
              some cash and stuff. We just don't
              have enough to cover all 3 lift
              tickets, you know?

    Jason exhales two lungs full of smoke as the next group gets
    onto the lift.


                          JASON
              How much?

                        PARKER
              Like...fifty?

    Jason scoffs and starts the lift.

                        JASON
              I could lose my job.

    He looks around.


5   EXT. SNOW BANK OVERLOOKING THE CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS        5
    Lynch and Dan watch Parker at work.

                        LYNCH
              He's not going for it.

                        DAN
              Will you shut up? He's gonna go
              for it. It's either stand there
              and do the job for minimal...
              minimal, what is it?

                          LYNCH
              Minimum.

                        DAN
              -Minimum wage or do it for minimum
              wage plus a little bit more.

    Lynch sighs, then changes the subject.

                        LYNCH
              She had to come skiing with us?

    Dan looks back at him, offended.
                                                         6.



                    DAN
          You said you didn't mind?

                     LYNCH
          I don't.   I don't mind.   Don't mind
          at all.




                                                    X
A beat.

                    LYNCH (cont'd)
          I'm just saying, you haven't done
          dollar pitchers at Fezziwigs with




                                                  R
          us since last semester. You never
          come around for Monday night
          football, nobody has seen you at-

                    DAN




                                      A
          -I watched the game with you last
          week!

                    LYNCH
          For ten minutes, Dan. Football
          games are more than ten minutes.




                        M
          They're lots of ten minutes-es, you
          know?

                    DAN
          Dude, I have a girlfriend now. I
          love this girl. I don't know what
          you...




  D
                    LYNCH
          No, no it's fine. I'm just saying,
          the Mount Holliston day trips were
          our thing, you know? She doesn't
          even know how to board yet.




E
                     DAN
          She's getting better.
              (then)
          Now I feel like a dick. You should
          have said something if it was a
          problem.

                    LYNCH
          It's not a problem. It's not.
          Forget I ever said anything.

They see Parker hand Jason something. He pockets it and she
glides her way back to the end of the line.

She looks up at the guys waiting on the hill and then
excitedly waves. Proud of herself.
                                                              7.



    Dan smiles at Lynch.


6   EXT. CHAIR LIFT LINE - CONTINUOUS                             6
    Lynch and Dan join Parker and slowly work their way up the
    line.




                                                       X
                           DAN
              Good work!     See?   They always go
              for it.




                                                     R
                        PARKER
              I did good, right?

                        LYNCH
              You did great.




                                           A
                        DAN
              Oh, so where's my change?

                        PARKER
              There isn't any.




                              M
                        DAN
              You gave him the full hundred?

                        PARKER
              He wasn't going for it at 50.

                        DAN




      D
              So what happened to the other fifty
              numbers in between there? Like, I
              don't know, $51 or maybe even $75?

                        PARKER




    E
              You gave me two 50's. What was I
              supposed to do, ask for change?

                        LYNCH
              I would have asked for change.

                        PARKER
              It's still way cheaper than paying
              for tickets, right?

    Dan is disappointed.

                        LYNCH
              I would have definitely asked him
              for change.
                                                                8.



    They get up to the front of the line.    Jason looks at Dan and
    Lynch behind Parker.

                        JASON
                  (scoffs at Parker)
              "Girlfriends"?




                                                         X
    Parker gives him an apologetic smile.

    The three get in front of the chair. It descends under them
    and scoops them off of the ground into the air.




                                                       R
7   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - MOMENTS LATER                                 7
    The threesome float high above the mountain as the chair
    slowly makes it's way to the top.




                                          A
                         DAN
              Look at that. See? All these
              other idiots are paying top dollar
              to ski. Not us. All thanks to
              you, baby.




                           M
                        PARKER
                  (teasing)
              Oh, now I'm "baby"?     You never call
              me pet names.

                        DAN
              I'm just not a `pet name' guy.




      D
                        PARKER
                  (to Lynch)
              He calls me "Parker."




    E
                        DAN
              It's your name.

                        PARKER
              Yeah but you're supposed to call me
              something affectionate, you know?
              Like "honey" or "sweetie".

                        LYNCH
              I hooked up with a girl last
              semester that called me by my last
              name in bed. It was so weird.
              "Oh, Lynch! Your hair is so soft!
              Do me harder, Lynch!" It was like
              I was throwing it to Dan over here.

    Dan looks back to Parker.
                                                          9.



                    DAN
          See? At least I don't call you
          "O'Neil".

                    PARKER
          You don't touch my face enough
          either.




                                                  X
Dan laughs.

                    LYNCH
              (to no one imparticular)




                                                R
          Third wheel.

Parker reaches across and playfully taps Lynch.

                    PARKER




                                   A
          Watch it, Lynch.

                    LYNCH
          Hey, that's not fair. I'm not
          dating you, you don't get to make
          my life suck.




                          M
Parker shoots Dan a look: "Oh, really?"

                    DAN
          Wha-? I never said that. I never
          said you make my life suck.
              (then, forced)
          Sweetie.




  D
After a beat he awkwardly reaches out and touches her face.
Nothing sweet or sensitive about it, but he's trying.

                       PARKER




E
                 (sarcastically)
          Aww!

                    LYNCH
              (to Parker)
          Dan tells me you're getting the
          hang of that board?

                    PARKER
          I wouldn't say that. But last time
          we went I did pretty good, right?

                    DAN
          You did awesome. I'm telling you,
          the first few times are frustrating
          but once you get the hang of it,
          it's like riding a bike.

              (to Lynch's skis)
          Are you gonna trade in those
          ancient things for a board?

                    LYNCH
          Please. Snowboards are too EMO for
          me. Give it ten more years and
          that fad will be dead.

                    DAN
          That's what they said about rap.

Parker removes a cigarette and lights it.




                                               R
                    LYNCH
          Mmm-mmm. Smell that fresh mountain
          air, huh? Kind of smells like...
          cancer.




                                   A
                    PARKER
          You know what, I am so sick of
          potheads giving me shit about
          smoking butts.




                       M
                    LYNCH
          At least pot does something for
          you. Cigarettes are just gross.
          Especially out in the cold. It
          like sticks to you and then you
          smell like a mixture of ash tray
          and an old man's used floss.




  D
                    DAN
          Used floss? Where do you come up
          with this shit.

                    LYNCH




E
          Have you ever sniffed your floss?
          It's nasty.

Dan and Lynch both crack up at this, huge.

                    DAN
          No, I have never- why would I ever
          sniff my floss? Why am I friends
          with you?

Parker blows more smoke out.

                    DAN (cont'd)
          Gimme a drag.

He takes her cigarette from her.
                                                          11.



                    PARKER
          What time do you think we'll get
          back? I have about 2 weeks worth
          of chapters to read tonight.

                    LYNCH
          Oh no. She broke the rule.




                                                 X
              (to Parker)
          Parker you just broke the first
          rule.

                    PARKER




                                               R
          What?

                    DAN
          No worrying about the bullshit of
          real life. The whole point of this




                                   A
          is to relax and have fun. Worry
          about school when you get home.

                    PARKER
          But, I haven't read a-




                          M
The chair suddenly stops and lurches forward slightly.   The
sound of the chair lift cuts out.

A deep silence takes over quickly, like the type of silence
that used to suddenly happen in school when you were taking a
test and the radiator that you never even noticed was on
would suddenly shut off.




  D
Random SKIERS and BOARDERS in the surrounding chairs express
their disgust for the delay.

Parker instinctively grabs Dan's hand.




E
                    DAN
          It's alright.

                   LYNCH
          Uh-oh! Is someone afraid of
          heights?

                    PARKER
          No.

                    LYNCH
          So it doesn't bother you when I do
          this?

Lynch rocks the chair back and forth.

Parker grabs hold of the safety bar.
                                                         12.



                     PARKER
          Quit it!

Dan motions to Lynch to stop.

                    PARKER (cont'd)
          I'm not afraid of heights.   I just




                                                  X
          don't like them.

                     DAN
          Baby, in the whole history of time,
          only one chair has ever fallen off




                                                R
          of a lift.

                    PARKER
          Points for calling me "baby" but
          you just made that statistic up.




                                   A
                    LYNCH
          Yeah, statistics don't work on
          smokers.

                    PARKER




                        M
              (nervous laughter)
          Oh, shut-up.

Lynch turns around and yells behind him.

                    LYNCH
          OK, WHAT ASSHOLE COULDN'T GET ON
          THE CHAIR RIGHT?




  D
Laughter echoes from the chairs behind him.

He yells forward.




E
                    LYNCH (cont'd)
          COME ON, I PAID GOOD MONEY TO DO
          SOME SKIING!

                    DAN
          Actually, I paid good money.

                    LYNCH
          Yeah, but I'm gonna pay you back so
          it's like the same thing.

With a lurch, the chair starts moving forward again and the
whirring sound of the cables above them start up again.

Applause is heard from all of the other chairs.
                                                                 13.



                        LYNCH (cont'd)
              THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!
              WOO!

    Dan lets go of Parker's hand and gives her a smile.   She
    smiles back.




                                                      X
    He playfully sticks his tongue out at her and she laughs as
    their chair moves forward exiting frame.


8   EXT. TOP OF THE CHAIR LIFT - LATER                                8




                                                    R
    The three begin to get situated with their boards and skis.

                        PARKER
              Why do I have to wear a helmet?




                                         A
                        DAN
              Safety first.

                        PARKER
              But you guys don't wear them.




                              M
    She looks around.

                        PARKER (cont'd)
              I only see little kids wearing
              them.

                        DAN




      D
              Cause they're still learning, too.
              Come on, I'm not gonna argue about
              this.

                        LYNCH




    E
              Even extreme boarders wear helmets.
              Nobody makes fun of them.

    She begrudgingly puts on her helmet.   She's not happy about
    it.

    Dan and Lynch smile.

                           DAN / LYNCH
              Awww.

                        PARKER
              You're just doing this to make fun
              of me.

    Dan's laughing.
                                                         14.



                    DAN
          No, I'm not. I swear.    You look
          hot in a helmet.

Off to the side, Lynch spots SHANNON (cute, brunette, 20's)
struggling with her boot strap. She falls down on her ass.




                                                X
Lynch nonchalantly maneuvers over to her side.

                    LYNCH
          Need some help?




                                              R
                    SHANNON
              (laughing)
          Do you think?

Lynch puts out a hand to help her and pulls her up almost




                                    A
directly into his face.

Parker and Dan watch from afar as Lynch helps her with her
boot strap.

He has one hand innocently on the back of her knee and he is




                         M
fastening the strap with his other.

                    PARKER
          Aww, check out Lynch.

From their point of view, they watch Lynch helping the girl.

                     DAN




  D
          See?   Chick magnet.

Almost as if on cue, RYAN (an enormous dude, 20's) stomps
over and shoves Lynch down into the snow.




E
                    RYAN
          What the hell?

Lynch tries to get up.

                    LYNCH
          Woah! Shit, man!    I was just
          trying to help!

Instantly, Dan moves over to Lynch's aid. Parker follows
slowly behind him. She's clearly not too good on her board.

                    SHANNON
          Ryan, what the hell?

                    RYAN
          He had his hands all over you!
                                                        15.



                    SHANNON
          No he didn't. I can take care of
          myself!

She shoves him back. Ryan just shakes his head at her and
shoves off, away from the group. He waits for her down the
hill a few feet.




                                                  X
Dan and Shannon help Lynch to his feet.

                    SHANNON (cont'd)
          I am so sorry about that. He can




                                                R
          be such an asshole sometimes.

                    LYNCH
          I was seriously just trying to
          help. I mean, how could I even




                                    A
          compete with a catch like that?

He waves to Ryan.   Ryan just looks away.

                    SHANNON
              (laughs)




                          M
          Are you OK?

                    LYNCH
          Yeah, I'm fine.

                     SHANNON
          Well, thank you for your help.    I
          am so, so sorry about that.




  D
              (then)
          I'm Shannon, by the way.

                     LYNCH
          Joe.




E
                    RYAN
              (calling to her)
          Shan!

Shannon rolls her eyes.

                    SHANNON
          Well it was nice to meet you.

She takes off after Ryan.

                    LYNCH
              (to his friends)
          I was like one second away from
          beating that guy's ass.
                                                               16.



                        DAN
              I know you were, man.   Come on.
              Don't sweat it.

                        LYNCH
              Seriously, that guy was such a
              dick.




                                                     X
                        PARKER
              Come on boys. We can talk about
              how tough you both are at the
              bottom.




                                                   R
    Lynch starts down the hill.

                           DAN
              I'm tough.




                                        A
                        PARKER
              I know you are.

    They push off out of frame.

9   EXT. SKI TRAIL - LATER                                          9
    Dan, Parker, and Lynch move down the mountain on their snow
    boards and skis.

    Quick cuts of Dan helping Parker learn.    Lynch impatiently
    waits.




      D
    Finally, Parker comes to a stop on her own next to Dan and he
    claps for her.

                        DAN




    E
              Look at you! See?   Having fun?

                        PARKER
              Are you kidding? We are totally
              doing this every weekend. In fact,
              if they were open during the week
              I'd say we should cut class, too.

    Lynch suddenly flies over the hill and sprays both of them
    down with powder.

                        LYNCH
              Last one to the bottom is buying
              dinner!

    He eats it mere seconds later and lands on his ass.
                                                              17.



     Parker and Dan take off laughing while Lynch feebly tries to
     get back on his feet.


10   INT. SKI LODGE - EARLY EVENING                            10
     Parker gets herself some hot chocolate in the distance while




                                                       X
     Dan and Lynch pick at what's left of a pizza on the table in
     front of them.

                         DAN
               We gotta take a weekend trip up




                                                     R
               North one of these days. Hit up
               Killington or Okemo and really do
               it up right.

                         LYNCH




                                        A
               Why don't we just do it over
               Christmas. You and me.

                         DAN
               Done. When I stayed with my cousin
               out West two years ago it was like




                            M
               the stuff you see in commercials.
               We had to take like 3 lifts to get
               to the top and it was powder as far
               as you could see.

                         LYNCH
               Well, speaking of good skiing...
               it's been cool doing the bunny hill




       D
               all day but do you think we could
               get one real run in before we leave
               tonight?

     Dan feels bad.




     E
                         DAN
               Dude, you didn't have to stay with
               us. It's totally cool if you want
               to go off for a few.

     Parker is now walking back to their table behind Lynch and is
     pretty much right on top of them.

                         LYNCH
               No, it's fine. I'm just saying
               let's step it up a notch at some
               point. It's been cool watching
               Parker fall on her ass all day but
               I would like to actually ski at
               some point.
                                                   18.



Parker feels horrible.

                    PARKER
          You know, I've probably had enough
          for today anyway. I can just stay
          in the lodge if you guys want to go-




                                                   X
Now Lynch feels horrible.

                    LYNCH
          -no, no, no that's not what I
          meant. I didn't mean it like that.




                                                 R
Parker looks to Dan.

                    PARKER
          I told you I didn't have to come.




                                    A
                    LYNCH
          Parker, I didn't not want you to
          come.

Dan tries to help.




                          M
                    DAN
          It was his idea that we invited you
          in the first place.

                    LYNCH
          Exactly. Remember? I was like
          "Hey man, why doesn't Parker come




  D
          with us?" And you were like-

                    DAN
          -I was like, "OK that would be
          cool".




E
Parker isn't buying it.   She puts on a smile.

                    PARKER
          It's OK, you guys. The last thing
          a girl wants to do is intrude on
          "guy time". I won't be offended.
          I've got stuff I could do anyway.
              (to Dan)
          Actually, can I have the key? I
          should check my messages.
                                                  19.



                    DAN
          No. No locker key. I can tell you
          right now that every message on
          there is going to be from your Mom
          giving you more aggravation about
          whatever the hell.




                                                  X
Parker laughs.

                    PARKER
          She does not.

Dan looks to Lynch.

                    DAN
          Ready for this? Two nights ago we
          were watching a movie and her Mom




                                    A
          kept calling and calling.
              (to Parker)
          And what did she want?

Parker laughs.




                         M
                    DAN (cont'd)
          She wanted to know if we wanted to
          have chicken soup or vegetable soup
          with Christmas dinner. Christmas
          dinner! Four weeks away, and she
          had to now right then and there
          what kind of soup we'd prefer.




  D
                    LYNCH
          What did you say?   You said
          chicken.

                    DAN




E
          Hell yes, I said chicken, but
          that's not the point.
              (to Parker)
          The point is you can go a few more
          hours without hearing from Annette.

Parker looks to Lynch.

                     PARKER
          I'm sorry if I ruined skiing for
          you today.
                                                                 20.



                         LYNCH
               You didn't! You didn't at all!
               You missed the part before you
               walked over here when I was all
               like, "Dude, this has been so
               cool...you know...doing..."

     Parker and Dan are beaming at him.   He knows he's beat.

                         LYNCH (cont'd)
                   (frustrated)
               What?

11   EXT. FRONT OF LODGE - MOMENTS LATER, NIGHT                   11
     Parker, Dan, and Lynch come out of the lodge.




                                          A
     From their POV the chair lift is still moving but the line is
     empty.

     They start to move to the empty lift line when...




                            M
                         SHANNON (O.C.)
               Joe!

                         LYNCH
                   (to his friends)
               Wait up.

     Lynch walks over to Shannon while Dan and Parker move towards




       D
     the lift line.

                        SHANNON
               Hey. I just wanted to apologize
               again.




     E
                         LYNCH
               Oh, no big deal. He's just lucky
               he didn't make me mad. You know, I
               just look half your boyfriend's
               size.

                         SHANNON
               Ex. He's my ex-boyfriend. We're,
               you know, trying to still be
               friends and everything but as you
               can see, that's not really gonna
               work.

                         LYNCH
                   (teasing)
               No way.
                                                        21.



                    SHANNON
          A group of us all agreed to go
          skiing this weekend and well,
          whatever. It's a whole story and-

She looks over at Dan and Parker.

                     SHANNON (cont'd)
          -I don't want to hold you up. But
          that was just really embarrassing.
          So I just wanted to say sorry.
              (then)




                                                R
          Are you gonna be here next weekend?

                    LYNCH
          Where, here? Yeah, probably, yes.




                                      A
                    SHANNON
          Cool. Well, my roommate and I come
          like every Sunday, so maybe I'll
          see you.

                    LYNCH




                          M
          That would be...a nice time.

                     SHANNON
          OK.   See ya later.

She turns and starts walking away.

Lynch walks away. He gets a few steps and then turns back




  D
and jogs after Shannon again.

                    LYNCH
          Actually, you know what? Would it
          be cool if I got your number or




E
          something? That way I'll...know
          how to catch up with you and stuff.

                    SHANNON
          Yeah, sure.

Lynch pats his pockets.

                    LYNCH
          Shit. Don't ski with my phone.
          It's in the locker with everyone
          else's stuff. Do you have a pen?

She laughs and shakes her head no.

                    SHANNON
          Don't ski with a pen.     Sorry.
                                                              22.



                         LYNCH
               Just shoot then. I've got a really
               good memory. I've only smoked pot
               like 500 times so I'm good.

     Shannon gets serious.




                                                         X
                         SHANNON
               You know it's a gateway drug right?

     Joe is nervous.




                                                       R
                          SHANNON (cont'd)
               Kidding.

                          LYNCH
               Whew.   You! That's so like you!

12   EXT. CHAIR LIFT LINE - MOMENTS LATER                         12
     Dan and Parker are in a heated debate with Jason the chair
     lift operator.




                                M
     He puts a red flag on the back of a chair that heads up the
     mountain.

                         DAN
               But we gave you a hundred bucks and
               we've only gotten like 4 runs!




       D
                         JASON
               It's not my decision, man.    They're
               closing early.

                         DAN




     E
               You're only open three days a week.
               You can't afford to close early.

                         JASON
               Why don't you write a letter?

     Lynch pushes himself up behind them.

                         LYNCH
                   (to Dan)
               Remember "429".

                          DAN
               What?

                       LYNCH
             Just remember "429".
                 (to himself)
             "5022". "5022." "5022."

             Sorry.

             Honestly, I'd slide you some more
             money but we gave you everything we
             have.

Jason ignores him.

                       JASON
             It's not about the money. They
             need to clear the mountain. We've
             got weather coming in. There's
             nothing I can do.

                       PARKER
             What if we promise to run straight




  D
             down. Like the quickest run ever.

                       DAN
             Wicked fast.




E
Jason struggles. He sighs and looks around.        There are still
plenty of skiers coming down.

                      JASON
             Fine. But hurry.
                DAN                              PARKER
Thank you!                           Thank you so much!


                       DAN
             We'll be wicked fast.    Like the
             wind!

Jason sends them up the lift.    He checks to make sure no one
is watching.
                                                              24.

     Parker, Dan, and Lynch slowly move up the mountain yet again.

                         LYNCH
               Seriously. For a hundred bucks

               you'd think he could cut us some
               slack.

               I know right? They're supposed to

               stay open until 10 on Sundays.
               Whatever happened to night skiing?

                          LYNCH
               Wachusett still has night skiing.




                                          A
               We should have gone there. It's
               kinda like Ward Hill but not as
               lame.
                   (then)
               Hey, you remember the numbers I

               Wait, shit. What were my four
               numbers? "5022". Parker, will you
               remember "5022"?

                          PARKER
               Nope.

     Jason reaches for his cigarettes.    He's all out.

     Disappointed he tosses the empty pack in the trash.

               Early night, huh?

                         JASON
               You're not gonna hear me complain.

               Pendergraft wants you to stop by
               the office.   Something about next
               weekend's schedule.

                         JASON
               I'm not working next weekend.

     Rifkin gives him a look.   "That's what you thought."

                         JASON (cont'd)
               Oh, come on. It's my brother's
               bachelor party. I put in for it
               two months ago.




                               M
                         RIFKIN
               Go talk to the boss. He's getting
               ready to leave.

                         JASON
               I'm the best man!
                   (under his breath)
               Shit.




       D
     Rifkin takes his place.

                         RIFKIN
               Ready to shut down?




     E
     As Jason runs away he turns back.

               I'm not waiting til we get back to
               campus to eat. I'm starving.

                    DAN
          Why didn't you have some pizza?

                    PARKER
          You mean the cardboard with tomato
          sauce that you guys ate? That
          wasn't pizza. That was like,

          `roller skating rink birthday party

          back. It's like 15 minutes down
          the road from the mountain.

                    PARKER
          Sweet. I am gonna eat a whole real

Dan spies something.

They look down to see THREE SKIERS hit a huge jump, one after
the other.

                    DAN (cont'd)
          We are so hitting that jump.

          Last run. Gotta make it count.

The wind blows the chair really hard.

Parker holds on.

          Jesus!

The guys just laugh.

          It's just wind, Parker.

Parker starts laughing.

     Rifkin warms his hands with his breath.       The temperature is
     dropping fast.

     He checks his watch, dancing back and forth.

     Heyman points to his ears as if he can't hear what Rifkin is

     saying to him. He keeps running.

     A low, distant thunder roll echoes far away.

               Shit.   Do you hear that?




     E

               It's the mountains.    It snows every
               night. Relax.

     The chair moves on in silence for a few moments.

                         PARKER
               Seriously. I'm gonna eat a whole
               pizza.
                   (a few beats)
               I'm not even kidding.

     Rifkin kicks his feet around. He spies Jason's discarded
     cigarette box on the top of the trash and he inspects it for
     any left over cigarettes.




                                                      X
     Nothing.

     He sighs.

     Just then, the three skiers that we saw taking the jump a few




                                                    R
     minutes earlier come flying down the mountain and past him.

     A voice from the top lift cuts through the radio.

                 Last chair is through.

     Rifkin picks up the radio and calls the top of the mountain.

                          RIFKIN
                 Cool. Last three just hit.   I'm

     The chair lurches to a stop. Once again, the comforting




     E
     white noise of the motorized cables goes away, leaving them
     in silence.

     The wind blows hard against them.

                           DAN
                 Oh, come on.

     Parker instinctively grabs his hand.

     The cold bites through their layers of clothing.

                           PARKER
                 Bur!

     light of converging white strings.

     Even in this darkness, the menacing clouds are visible over

     The three sit in the freezing chair.   Lynch is really getting
     impatient.

               What do you think the worst way to
               die would be?
                                        30.



           PARKER
 That's not morbid.

           LYNCH
 Yeah, seriously.    That's kinda
 spooky, Dan.

            DAN
 I think getting eaten by a shark
 would be the worst way to go.

 Not if it was like one of those




                                      R
 surfers where they get hit from
 behind and they don't even know
 what happened.

 You know. Cause it like came up




                            A
 from beneath them.
     (beat)
 Like on the Jaws poster.

 The chick on the Jaws poster was

 hot.

            PARKER
 She was?

           LYNCH
 I don't know. She was naked.
 Naked chicks are hot.




  D
           DAN
 But if you actually like saw the
 fin coming for you in the water.
 That would be worse than actually




E
 getting eaten. Knowing that this
 animal is coming for you but you
 can't get away. And that it's
 going to eat you. Like you're
 gonna get eaten alive? Have you
 guys ever seen that footage of the
 great white jumping out of the
 water to eat that seal?

           LYNCH
 That's why I only swim in pools.

            PARKER
 I think burning to death would be
 the worst.
                                                 31.



                    LYNCH
          Well yes and no. Because most
          people die of the smoke inhalation
          before any fire even hits them.

                    PARKER
          I remember watching TV for like 3

          days straight after 9/11. That
          footage that they kept showing of
          all of those people leaping off of
          the top of the Trade Center? Can
          you imagine how bad it was inside

          to know that jumping was a better
          way out?

                    LYNCH
          But they say that when you jump




                                     A
          from that high up your heart stops
          before you hit the ground and you
          don't even feel it.

                    PARKER
          OK, then Lynch. What is the worst




                         M
          way to die?

                    LYNCH
              (defensive)
          What?

                    PARKER
          No, you have an answer for




  D
          everything. What's your biggest
          fear?

Lynch has been waiting for this.

          The Sarlaac pit. From Return of

                 line going people". But no. They
                 had to stop and celebrate it right

                                                 X
          off the lights and scare the
          customers?

                     DAN
          They just lost power or something.




                                               R
          I'm sure it's gonna come back on
          any second.
              (then)
          They didn't go home. That's
          retarded.

After a few more moments.

                    LYNCH
          This is so messed up.




                       M
                    DAN
          It's a power outage. They'll come
          up with a ladder if they have to.

Parker is starting to whimper. In a few more seconds she may
even be teetering on full-on panic.

                    PARKER




  D
          We need to get down from here. We
          can't just sit up here. Why isn't
          the goddamn chair moving, Dan?
          What the hell?!




E
                     DAN
          Well you being all psycho about it
          isn't gonna make it move. Just
          chill out.

Another few beats.

                    PARKER
          Don't yell at me.

                    DAN
          I wasn't yelling at you but you
          need to relax. This stuff happens
          all the time. Can you imagine the
          law suit if they left everyone on
          this lift up here all night?
                                                         35.

          Free lift tickets.

                    PARKER
          What other people on the lift?
          There was no one in front of us.




                                                 X
She made a good point.   But still...

                    DAN
          We won't be stuck here all night.

          No. You're right. We won't be
          here all night. It's Sunday.

Silence as Dan and Lynch take this in.

                    PARKER (cont'd)
          We're gonna die up here.

Lynch tries to be the voice of reason.

                    LYNCH
          We're not going to be stuck here.
          Parker. Parker, look at me. Even




  D
          if by some strange reason they
          really did forget us up here- we
          can jump. I see people jump off of
          chair lifts all the time.




E
                    DAN
          It's true. I've done it before.
          You just get tired of waiting, you
          wait for a spot with some serious
          powder and you just jump. It's
          actually kind of fun, but they can
          ban you from the mountain for it.

Looking below them, it is way too far a drop to be jumping
off of the chair.

                    PARKER
              (hysterical)
          -HELP!!! SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP
          US!!!! HEL-LO!!! HELP!!!!!

She cries into Dan's shoulder.
                                                         36.



                       DAN
             Shh. I know you're scared. I'm
             scared, too. But any minute now
             they're gonna turn the power back
             on and we're all gonna be laughing
             about this.




                                                      X
More moments pass in silence as they survey their situation.

Finally...

                       PARKER




                                                    R
             I have to pee.

They all share an uncomfortable laugh.

                       PARKER (cont'd)




                                         A
             I have to pee wicked bad.

                       LYNCH
             That makes two of us.

                       PARKER




                          M
             Ew, Lynch if you pull out your junk
             in front of me I'm gonna puke.

                       LYNCH
             Well, what do you want me to do?   I
             gotta go.

                       PARKER




  D
             How am I supposed to go?

Dan moves the safety bar a little.

                       DAN




E
             Well if we just lift the bar up you
             could probably just bend over if we
             hold on to you.

Parker instantly starts freaking out with the bar up.

                       PARKER
             Are you crazy! Put the bar down!!!

                       LYNCH
             It's just the safety bar. It
             doesn't really do anything anyway.

                       PARKER
             Well I like the safety bar and I
             like it down where it's supposed to
             be.
                                                         37.



                    DAN
          Then how are you going to piss?

                    PARKER
          I can hold it.

                    LYNCH




                                                  X
          For a whole week?

Dan and Parker glare at him.

                     LYNCH (cont'd)




                                                R
          Sorry.
              (then)
          She's the one who said we'd be here
          for "a week"!




                                      A
Parker takes a deep breath.

                    PARKER
          I can hold it.

                    DAN




                        M
          I'm telling you, five minutes from
          now we'll all be laughing.

                    LYNCH
          I'm pissing.

Lynch lifts the safety bar up, whips out his business and
starts to pee off the side of the chair into the snow below




  D
them.

                    DAN
          I hope they catch you and throw you
          out. I hope they ban you from the




E
          mountain. That's so nasty.

                    LYNCH
          Ban me from the mountain? You
          couldn't pay me to come back here.
          Make me sit up here in below zero
          weather forever while they get
          their damn Fisher Price lift
          working? Sorry. Not coming back.

Lynch finishes his business.

                     LYNCH (cont'd)
          There.   Much better.

A low thunder clap rolls in across the trees and the chilling
wind picks up.
                                                                  38.



                          DAN / PARKER / LYNCH
               HELP!   / HEL-LO! / UP HERE!

     They continue to scream their heads off for a few moments
     until freezing sleet starts falling all around them, soaking
     them through to the bone.




                                                     X
     Almost instantly, giant balls of hail stream down at them.
     "Ping-ing" off of the metal chair and pelting their faces.

     The wind blows hard as their flimsy chair swings back and
     forth in the foul weather.




                                                   R
     Parker sobs quietly into Dan's shoulder.

                         LYNCH

               PUT THE BAR DOWN!




     E
     Lynch pulls the bar down and sulks, looking away from Dan.

     The hail/sleet mixture keeps pelting against their skin as
     they sit together in silence.

     Another loud thunder clap hits.   This time, much closer.

     Suddenly, a beam of light begins to shine up at them.

                         LYNCH
               What is this asshole doing?

     The Snow Cat switches back into drive.
                                                                42.



                           PARKER
               No!   No!

     Quickly Dan and Lynch start to ball together the slush on the
     sides of the chair.

     They throw them at the Snow Cat, but keep missing by a few




                                                    X
     inches.

     Desperately, Lynch throws his goggles at the Snow Cat.

     They land just shy of the driver's side window.




                                                  R
     Parker takes off her helmet and throws it down.

                                                       CUT TO:

     Steve turns the headlights in the opposite direction, just
     missing the helmet falling past his windshield.




                               M
     Though we can briefly see the light shine off of the three
     kids, unless you knew they were there or were looking for
     them...you would have missed them, too.

     As the windshield turns the other way, one of Lynch's skis
     slams into the ground, just out of the headlight's view.

                                                       CUT TO:

     Lynch throws one of his ski poles but doesn't even come
     close.

     Parker sobs hysterically.

                         PARKER
               NOOOO!!!!!!

                                                  HARD CUT TO:

     It has stopped hailing.

     The moon shines down on the mountain.     It glistens like a
     block of ice.

     Silence.

                It has to.

     trees.

Silence.

They steal glances at each other.    They are soaked through.
Parker's hair is frozen.

           We can't just sit up here until
           next weekend. We'll die.

No one acknowledges him.

He sighs and closes his eyes.

Parker starts to cry.   Neither of the guys even try to
console her.
                                               45.



Finally, Dan puts an arm around her.

                     DAN (cont'd)
          Shhh.   It's OK.

          It's alright. It's alright.

Snow starts to lightly fall around them.

          Hey.    It's snowing.

They shiver together.

           skis! Get it? MY SKIS. How

Silence.

Parker takes off her glove to light a cigarette.

As she struggles with the lighter, the glove falls out of her
lap and lands on the ground below them.

           Shut-up.




                          M
She keeps struggling with the lighter but eventually gives
up. She throws the cigarette away and puts her exposed hand
back in her pocket.

The snow falls around them.

Dan pushes the safety bar up.




  D
                     PARKER (cont'd)
           -what, what are you doing?

                     DAN

           Dan...woah. Let's talk about this.

                       PARKER
           No.    No, don't leave me up here.

Dan takes her face in his hands.    Tenderly.   And probably for
the first time...correctly.

                     DAN
           Parker, I can do this. Even if I
           get hurt, as long as I can get to
           the bottom I....your skin is so
           red. You're getting frost bite.
                                                            47.



                    LYNCH
          You can't get frost bite that fast.
          It's only been- what, like...how
          long has it been? A few hours,
          tops?

Dan inspects Parker's face. It's tough to see in the dark,




                                                   X
but the tip of her nose and her right cheek (the side facing
into the wind) is discoloring.

                    PARKER
              (quietly)

Lynch is looking down below them.    It's far.

                    LYNCH
          Dan, it's a far drop.     I don't
          know.

          off of a lift before.

                    LYNCH




  D
          If we can wait `til morning I bet
          someone will come up here. Like a
          snow groomer or some shit.

                    DAN




E
          Really?   And why would they come
          groom the snow on a day when they
          aren't open, Joe? A day when they
          still have a full work week before
          they open again?

Lynch says nothing.

                    DAN (cont'd)
          I can do this.

He positions himself to try and jump off.     Parker grabs his
arm.

                    PARKER
          No, no, no. Please don't jump down
          there, Dan. You'll get hurt.

                    LYNCH
          How are you going to find your way
          in the dark?

                     DAN
          I'll stick to the trail. I'll ride
          to the bottom.

Dan drops his snowboard down.

It lands sticking up straight in the snow.

Parker and Lynch look back at him.      They don't know what to
say.

Lynch tries to grab on to Dan's arm.

                    LYNCH
          Walker, no.

Dan shrugs free.    He is determined.    Concentrating.

                      DAN
          One.

Parker's tears are freezing on her cheeks as the seconds tick
by.

          ...Two.




E
Lynch takes a deep breath. When enough time has elapsed to
think Dan's gonna jump, he suddenly looks up at Lynch instead
of jumping.

                    DAN (cont'd)
          Remember when I was saying how I
          jumped off one of these things
          before?

Lynch stares back at him.

                    DAN (cont'd)
          I totally lied. I'm scared
          shitless right now.

Lynch musters a laugh.      It's forced, but it's a laugh.
                                                               49.



     Dan laughs back at him. He turns to face Parker.    She tries
     to smile but is frozen with fear.

     Dan whispers to her...

     we drop (without cutting) from the chair all the way to the
     frozen ground below.

     Dan's cries turn to quiet breaths below them. It is tough

                  Dan, say something.     Are you

     More quiet breaths from below.

     Finally...

                  My legs.    I broke my fucking legs.

          Just hold on to my legs. You can't
          really stop me from falling...but
          it's, you know...psychological or
          something you know?




                                                R
Parker maneuvers herself to hold Joe's legs..

Joe tries to move into a standing position, but panics.

                    LYNCH (cont'd)
          OK...OK...just give me a second.

                    PARKER
          I think we should wait til morning.
          We can make it a few more hours.




                        M
                     LYNCH

          Us? Maybe.
              (then)
          But not him.

The gravity of this settles in.




  D
As Lynch gets ready to try and stand again...we hear
something in the surrounds.

They freeze.




E
Again, a sort of "moan" rings in the distance.

                    PARKER
          Baby, is that you?

                     DAN (O.C.)
          What?

          Shh!

               It's alright man. It's just a

               Wolves around here are pussies.
               They aren't even that big.

     They stop and listen...but there is only the sound of the
     rain.
                                                         59.

          It could be worse, right?

                    DAN (O.C.)
          How the hell...could this be worse?

Long pause...

                    PARKER
          It could be the Sarlacc Pit.

They can't believe it...but Dan and Lynch both actually




                                                   R
laugh. It's uncomfortable and forced as hell. But it's a
laugh.

          She's alright, Walker. Your girl

He focuses on the task at hand again.

                    LYNCH (cont'd)
          OK...here we go.

Slowly he pushes up on the back of the chair again. With one
hand on Parker's shoulder and another on the back post of the
chair, Lynch gets to his feet. Looking down at the drop, he
instantly crouches down again.




  D
                    LYNCH (cont'd)
          Holy shit, is that high up.

                    PARKER




E
          What can I do?

                     LYNCH
          Nothing.   Just be quiet.

He psyches himself up again and starts to rise up.

                    DAN (O.C.)
          You can do this, Lynch.     You've got
          it.

                    LYNCH
          Please stop talking.

He puts one foot up on the top of the chair back...but it
slips off to the side.
                                                                 60.

     Together, he and Parker start hitting the chair back.

     Shards of ice fall down around Dan.   He covers his head for

     protection.

     More chunks of ice shower down around Dan.

     Finally the falling ice subsides.

     Dan takes his gloves away from his face...only to freeze in
     horror.

     Not even 10 feet away, stands a WOLF.

     Silently the wolf watches him from the bushes.   Lightly
     growling.

     Lynch and Parker look down. From their POV they can see that
     the wolf is standing right next to Dan, watching him. No
     fear.

     THWOCK! Parker's snowboard comes down and skids away into
     the trees, pushing the wolf further back.

     The wolf darts back into the bushes. Though it can no longer
     be seen, we can hear it moving away through the brush and
     back into the darkness.

     Growls come from the surrounding bushes as the wolf angrily
     retreats.

Staying warm is absolutely impossible. Parker hides her
exposed hand deeper inside her wet jacket.

Icicles dangle from the bottom of the chair and their
clothing.

Lynch slowly lifts himself up onto the back of the chair,
which bends at an awkward angle.

From above him we can see the long drop down, and as he

arm- the height looks `stomach droppingly' scary.

Silence.

Lynch gets his gloved hands around the top of the cable.    It
is frozen over with a thick layer of ice.

The distance to the next chair seems about 10 times as far
now.

           I can do this. If Jenny Bluth
           could climb the rope, I can totally
           do this.

Slowly, he wraps his arms around the wire, now with his full
body weight on the back of the chair.

The bolt holding the arm into place on the cabling starts to
creak. It bends slightly, but seems to hold firm.

He starts to pull himself up onto the cable.

                    PARKER
          Don't look down.

With one hand in front of the other, Lynch hoists himself
about two feet off of the chair and into the air.

                    LYNCH




                                               R
              (gritted teeth)
          Slippery.

                    PARKER
          Do you got it?




                                        A
                       LYNCH
          Shh.

He slides out a little bit more, his feet dangling high above
the ground.




                          M
The cable clangs somewhere to the front and back of Lynch.
The noise is almost refreshing in the silent ice covered
wilderness.

With another deep breath, Lynch moves another two feet out
over the sky. He is straining hard.




  D
Another two feet out.    He looks down for the first time.

He sees something that scares the shit out of him.

                       LYNCH (cont'd)




E
          Oh god.

                    PARKER
          What's wrong?

                       LYNCH
          Please no.     Please no...

He starts to pull himself back to the chair, quickly.

                    DAN (O.C.)
          Come on, Lynch! You had it!

Lynch gets his foot on the icy chair back and tries to
balance his weight on it.
                                                                 66.



     SWISH! His foot slips off of it and he almost falls...but
     Parker grabs onto his coat.

                            PARKER
               I got you.

     Lynch scrambles into the chair and huddles next to Parker.




                                                      X
                         PARKER (cont'd)
               What's wrong?

     He looks at her, icy tears in his eyes.    His face is white.




                                                    R
                         PARKER (cont'd)
               What happened?

     Finally Lynch grabs her face in his hands.    He gets close to




                                           A
     her.

                         LYNCH
               Don't look down.

                            PARKER




                               M
               What?

     He grabs her head forcefully, trying to cover her ears.

                         LYNCH
               Don't look down there, Parker.

     The camera booms up and above them. As it tilts down at




       D
     them...we reveal Dan splayed out on the ground below.

     Out of the darkness of the bushes...a pack of SIX WOLVES
     slowly and silently descends on him from all angles.




     E
                          DAN (O.C.)
               Lynch?   What's wro-

64   EXT. BELOW THE CHAIR - CONTINUOUS                             64
     Dan hears the first growl.

                          DAN
               Oh shit.   Oh shit.

     The hungry wolves circle around him.   The smell of his
     freezing blood makes them drool.
                                                                  67.

65   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                                     65
     Lynch doesn't look down.       He just stares at Parker.

                          LYNCH




                                                         R
                   (fighting tears)
               YEAH, MAN.

                         DAN (O.C.)
                   (crying)




                                             A
               DON'T LET HER LOOK.

                            LYNCH
               I WON'T.

                         DAN (O.C.)




                               M
               DON'T YOU FUCKING LET HER LOOK.

     Lynch is trying to cover Parker's ears...but she can hear
     what they are saying. She forces her head free and steals a
     glance down.

     She sees Dan's untimely death approaching and instantly
     starts to scream and cry.




       D
     Lynch holds her head in a vice grip. He presses his forehead
     into hers. Her tears and snot overflow onto his gloves.

                        LYNCH




     E
               Shhhh. Don't listen to it.        Don't
               listen. Don't listen.

     As we push in tight on the two of their faces, below them we
     hear the wolves begin their attack on their defenseless prey.

     First one growl and a bite.

     Dan shrieks in pain.

                         DAN (O.C.)
               Don't let her look!

     Below we can hear him put up a fight. But the attacks and
     bites get more frequent and his screams even more painful.
                                                               68.



                          DAN (O.C.) (cont'd)
               Don't look! Don't you fucking look
               down here!

     The sound of several wolves attacking in unison over powers
     his cries.




                                                      X
     Lynch continues to hold his hands over Parker's ears and keep
     her eyes pointed at his as the sounds of Dan's demise echo
     through the night.

     The sounds of clothes being shredded, flesh being torn, and




                                                    R
     bones popping from their joints creates a chorus of pain
     below.

     Dan doesn't scream as much as does cry out in pain and agony.




                                         A
     The camera never sees it.   Only Lynch and Parker's faces.

     After what seems to be an unbearable minute...the sounds from
     below begin to dissipate.

     Eventually Dan's remains can be heard dragging away.




                            M
     Silence once again.

     Finally, Lynch let's go of Parker's head. He sobs into his
     own frozen gloves as Parker hysterically screams out into the
     night.

                                                         CUT TO:

     Parker's screams echo across the dark wilderness.   Somewhere




     E
     in the distance, birds take off in fear.

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:


67   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - MUCH LATER                                  67
     Lynch and Parker sit on the frozen chair, shivering.

     They are now in the devastating silence that has fallen after
     what must have been endless screaming and crying. Only the
     occasional sniffle lets us know that they are even awake.

     Finally Lynch breaks the silence.

                         LYNCH
               I should...try and...
                                                         69.



He starts to try and sit up on the back of the chair again to
continue his climbing effort.

                    PARKER
              (emotionless)
          Why did you let him jump?




                                                  X
Lynch turns and looks at her in disbelief.

                    LYNCH
          You can't be fucking serious.




                                                R
                    PARKER
          It was too far.

                     LYNCH
          He said he could do it. You didn't




                                      A
          try and stop him!
              (then)
          I can't believe this?! You're
          blaming me?

                    PARKER




                        M
          I'm not...I'm not blaming you.

                    LYNCH
          You're his girlfriend! I didn't
          see you throwing yourself in front
          of him!

                    PARKER




  D
          He wasn't going to listen to me.

                    LYNCH
          Oh, but he would have listened to
          me? I said it was a bad idea! I




E
          said it was too far a drop! But I
          didn't hear any better ideas out of
          you except for crying about it!
          Don't you fucking blame me! You've
          been his girlfriend, for what? A
          year maybe? I've known him my
          whole fucking life!

                    PARKER
          But you... You should have...

                     LYNCH
          What?   Say it.

Parker looks at him, uncertain.
                                                           70.



                     LYNCH (cont'd)
          Say it!   It should have been me?

                    PARKER
          I didn't say that.

                     LYNCH




                                                   X
          But you want to! It's OK. I get
          it. It should have been me down
          there cause who gives a fuck about
          me, right?




                                                 R
Parker feels terrible.    She puts her hand on his shoulder.

                       PARKER
          No, no, I-




                                     A
Lynch shrugs her hand off of him.

                    LYNCH
          You know what? If we hadn't spent
          the whole fucking day on the bunny
          slope watching you fall on your ass




                          M
          we would have gotten some real runs
          in and we could have just gone
          home!

                       PARKER
          I'm sorry.

                    LYNCH




  D
          You're sorry? Maybe if you hadn't
          fucked with our thing... maybe if
          you had just stayed home and not
          forced yourself into every aspect
          of his life... maybe my best friend




E
          wouldn't be dead right now!

                    PARKER
          That's not fair!

                    LYNCH
          And it's not fair that my best
          friend is DEAD!

Parker begins to sob.

                    PARKER
          I'm sorry! I didn't mean it!     I'm
          just- I'm just-

                       LYNCH
          -Fuck you.
                                                                 71.



      Lynch is numb.    He sits expressionless.   Seething.

      In her crying, Parker slowly keeps moving towards him. Like
      a puppy who knows they did something wrong and only wants you
      to love it again.

      Finally she gets next to him and buries her head in his

      chest, letting it all out.

      Eventually, Lynch can't help but feel compassion for her.    He
      puts his arm around her.




                                                      R
                          LYNCH (cont'd)

      Parker and Lynch are shivering together.

      After a beat, they begin to banter again. Everything is said
      in a monotone voice. They never even look at each other.




        D
      They only speak to be speaking.

                5022. 429-5022. I'm so gonna call
                that girl when we get home. And
                you know what? I'm gonna marry
                her. No messing around. I'm just
                gonna be like "Hey Shannon, it's me
                Joe from the chair lift. Will you
                marry me?" And then we're gonna
                get a house and have 2 kids and a

     Parker's face is expressionless.

                          PARKER
                Who's gonna pay for the house.

                            LYNCH
                She will.    Shannon's got a great

                What does she do.




                                                     R
     Lynch makes something up...but continues to have no
     expression in his words. Despite his talk, his spirit is
     shattered.

                          LYNCH

                Orthodontists make a lot of money.

     A wolf settles in the bushes and looks up at the two "pieces

     Another wolf lays down in the snow by a tree.

     They wait like vultures.


69   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                               69
     Silence.   Then...

                Who names their dog "Steve".

           house and have them say "Here's my

           dog.

           Shayna must be so hungry.

Lynch tries to change the subject.

                     LYNCH
           What kind of pizza should we get at
           Papa Gino's?




  D
Parker doesn't hear him. As she continues, wet snow starts
to fall around them and the icy wind starts to pick up.

                     PARKER




E
           The poor thing. She's just a
           puppy. She won't understand that I
           died. She's gonna think I left
           her. That I forgot about her. All
           she wants is for me to come home.
           She's probably waiting by the door
           for me right now. Every sound she
           hears in the hallway she's probably
           cocking her little head to the
           side, waiting to see if I'm going
           to walk in. But I won't. I won't
           ever walk in. And Shayna's going
           to starve to death. The poor thing
           is gonna wither away and die
           waiting by the door for me and it's
           all my fault.
                                                           74.



                    LYNCH
          She won't starve to death and
          you're not going to die.

                    PARKER
          No one else has a key to my place.

          The neighbors will break the door
          down if she doesn't stop barking.
          Someone will figure it out. She'll
          be fine.

He puts an arm around her and huddles closely trying to
shield the wind.

          eat. She's always late. But she
          brings all of the desserts. And
          she makes this special hot apple
          cider thing with cinnamon and
          nutmeg. It's so good. And after
          dinner my Dad always passes out on
          the couch `cause it's his one day
          off and he's had too much eggnog.
          And my sister, my Mom, and I watch
          A Christmas Story until the
          marathon is over. And that's how
          you know Christmas is really over.

               It's kind of sad because then you

     The camera pulls back wider and wider until their chair is
     lost in the wet snowfall and darkness.

     Slowly we fade to black as the wind howls and thunder gently
     rolls...




                                                    R

70   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - THE NEXT MORNING                           70
     Dawn is breaking over the trees.

     Lynch and Parker are still. Their bodies are huddled




                            M
     together, but neither is moving.

     In fact, at a first glance, one might think they are both
     human popcycles.

     The dark splotches of frost-bite on Parker's nose and cheeks
     have now grown to what almost looks like patches of black
     fungus on her skin.




       D
     Lynch has the start of his own frost-bite on his ears and
     nose.

     Slowly, Parker's eyes flutter and she awakens.




     E
     Her eyes search around as the realization that this was not
     all just a bad dream sinks in.

     She adjusts in her seat and feels something pull. She winces
     and looks down. Slowly the camera follows her stare down to
     reveal her bare hand, gripping the icy safety bar.

     She pulls...but her skin is stuck to the frozen metal.

     Beginning to panic, she jerks her hand hard, taking the bar
     up about half an inch with it.

                         PARKER
               Uhh...
                                                           76.



Painstakingly slow, she begins to peel her hand off of the
bar.

A sound that resembles `jeans slowly tearing' can be softly
heard as she moves her arm forward and separates her hand
from the skin that is attached to the metal.




                                                  X
After what feels like an eternity, she gives her hand one
last jerk, freeing it from the safety bar.

                    PARKER (cont'd)
          Ruuugh!




                                                R
Her movement startles Lynch awake, and he bolts upright as if
from a `falling nightmare'.

Discombobulated, Lynch turns back and forth frantically




                                      A
trying to get his bearings.

Parker is crying and holding her bloody hand,

                    PARKER (cont'd)
          Shhhh.




                       M
Lynch, bug-eyed, takes in the world around him.

A fresh coat of snow has covered everything in several inches
of peaceful white bliss.

Below them, the snow has completely covered Dan's remains.
There is nothing left to show that there was ever even a




  D
struggle.

Parker hides her bloody hand back inside of her coat, away
from Lynch's eyes.




E
                    LYNCH
          I...thought I was dreaming.   This.
          I thought this was a dream.

He turns to look at Parker. It takes everything he has to
not jolt back in horror at how bad her face looks.

                    PARKER
          What?

                    LYNCH
          Your frost-bite.   It's
          getting...worse.

She starts to touch her face.
                                                            77.



                      PARKER
          Really?    How bad is it?

Lynch stops her.

                      LYNCH
          Don't.    It's bad.




                                                 X
                    PARKER
          It's not as itchy any more.

                    LYNCH




                                               R
          Just don't touch your face, OK?
          When we get out of here, we'll get
          you to a doctor right away and
          they'll fix it.




                                      A
                     PARKER
          You have some dark spots on your
          face, too.

                    LYNCH
          They'll fix me, too then.   Just




                         M
          don't touch it.

He looks around, front to back.   In daylight it's easier to
see the other chairs.

His breath blows out of his body in huge plumes of mist.

                    LYNCH (cont'd)




  D
          Well, it's morning. Maybe someone
          will come up here now.

                      PARKER
          For what?




E
                    LYNCH
          I don't know. Mountain
          maintenance. Besides, when none of
          us show up for class people are
          going to start looking for us.

                    PARKER
          No one's gonna look for me. I skip
          class all the time. By the time
          anyone notices I'm gone I'll be
          dead.

                    LYNCH
          Can you please just think ONE
          positive thing? Please!
                                                          78.



                     PARKER
          Besides.   No one knows we're here.

                    LYNCH
              (to the sky)
          HEL-LO!!! WE NEED HELP!!      HELP!!!




                                                    X
His voice echoes off of the frozen trees, almost as if
taunting him.

He turns around to look at the chairs behind him.




                                                  R
                    LYNCH (cont'd)
          Alright. Look. If I can get to
          that chair...two back...I could
          make it to the ladder on that pole.
          I think I could make it down.




                                      A
Parker doesn't speak.

                     LYNCH (cont'd)
          Help me.




                        M
                    PARKER
          Are you sure you don't just wanna
          give it a few more hours? What if
          you're right? What if someone is
          going to come up here, even though
          they're not open today?

Lynch doesn't respond. The look on his face says that "no




  D
one is coming" but he decides there's no harm in waiting just
a little while longer.

Lynch tries to yell for help again, though his soar throat is
making it almost impossible to scream.




E
                     LYNCH
          UP HERE!   SOMEONE HELP US!

Once again...only echoes.

He re-settles in his chair.

                    PARKER
          I just wish I could stand up. Get
          out of this position for a minute.

                    LYNCH
          If you want, you can stand on the
          chair and I can hold onto you.
                                                                  79.



                            PARKER
               No.     I can't.

                         LYNCH
               Well, if anything's gonna get you
               over your fear of heights, it's
               this.

     Empty ski racks.

     E
     Lynch is sleeping. His head is leaned to one side in a
     position that is sure to give him the worst stiff neck he's
     ever had.

     Parker is ancy.    She looks all around.   Thinking.

     Finally she squeezes her eyes shut...embarrassed.

     Her snow pants turn dark around her bottom. Slowly a puddle
     of urine forms on the chair between her and Lynch.

     Below them, the urine falls into the snow and disappears.

     Parker's eyes swell as she begins to cry what's left of her
     tears. She is emotionally degraded and devastated.
                                                                  80.



     As her nose begins to run, she instinctively wipes her hand
     across it...taking a small piece of the dead flesh off of her
     cheek with it.

     She doesn't even feel it.

                                                     DISSOLVE TO:

73   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - LATER                                        73
     They both sleep.




                                                     R
     Finally, Lynch stirs and checks Parker to see if she is still
     breathing.

     It appears she is not.




                                           A
                          LYNCH
                Hey...hey Parker...

     He lightly shakes her.




                               M
     Nothing.

                          LYNCH (cont'd)
                Parker wake up.

     He shakes her harder and she comes to with a gasp.

                           PARKER




       D
                What?

                          LYNCH
                Shit, I thought you stopped
                breathing...




     E
     He notices her skinned cheek.    Her ear tips are now
     completely blackened.

                          PARKER
                What's wrong?

                           LYNCH
                Nothing.

     She studies his eyes.    Clearly something is very wrong.

                          LYNCH (cont'd)
                How about you help me up again and
                we try and get out of here?
                                                              81.

               Yeah.


74   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - LATER                                      74
     From beneath the chair we see shards of ice and snow fall

     onto the ground.

     Lynch is once again trying to maneuver himself up onto the
     chair back as Parker holds him steady.

                          LYNCH
               OK.   1...2...3-

     He hoists himself up onto the cable briefly, but after just a
     few seconds, he returns his feet to the chair back.




                                           A
     Parker holds onto his legs tightly.

                         LYNCH (cont'd)
               I feel like I gained about 100
               pounds overnight.




                               M
                         PARKER
               It was all that pizza talk.

                         LYNCH
               I have no strength.

                         PARKER




       D
               Then don't do this.

     Lynch tries again. He hoists himself up, but bails
     instantly...like a trainer giving up on his 100th pull up.




     E
                          LYNCH
               Damn it.

     He settles back down into the assumed position on the chair.

                         PARKER
               Maybe later.

                         LYNCH
               What? Like I'm gonna feel better
               if I wait a little longer? I
               should have done it last night
               while I still had some strength.
                                                                 82.



                         PARKER
               There's more snow fall on the
               ground and it's all fresh. Maybe
               the jump won't be as bad now.

                         LYNCH
               Even if it was a foot deeper- it




                                                        X
               wouldn't break that fall. I should
               have just climbed across last
               night. I had strength. I had
               adrenaline.




                                                      R
                         PARKER
               What do you want me to do?

                          LYNCH
               Nothing.   Let's sit and do nothing.




                                           A
     She reaches into her pocket and removes her cigarettes.     The
     box is damp, but the cigarettes inside are still dry.

     She starts to remove one but her gloved left hand and her
     numb right hand make her fumble the pack.




                             M
                                                          CUT TO:


75   EXT. BELOW THE CHAIR - CONTINUOUS                               75
     The pack of cigarettes falls into the snow.




       D
                          PARKER (O.C.)
               AHHHH!

                                                      HARD CUT TO:




     E
76   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - LATE AFTERNOON                                76
     The two are bundled together as the evening winds start to
     pick up.

     Again, they speak without emotion. It's conversation just to
     let themselves know that they are still alive.

                         PARKER
               How come you never have a
               girlfriend?

                         LYNCH
               How am I supposed to answer that?
                                         83.



           PARKER
 I mean, you're a decent guy. Girls
 dig you. But you never stay in a
 relationship.

           LYNCH
 I had a serious girlfriend once.




                                         X
           PARKER
 High School doesn't count.

           LYNCH




                                       R
 No, post-high school.   Freshmen
 year.

           PARKER
 Who?




                             A
           LYNCH
 This girl Annie. I met her at
 orientation. We emailed all summer
 and when we started school, it was
 like we were already going out. I




              M
 totally just felt it with her, you
 know? We were into a lot of the
 same stuff, which was cool. She
 was way into Aerosmith. I had seen
 them fifteen times, she had seen
 them twenty. How cool is that?

           PARKER




  D
 What happened?

           LYNCH
 She um... same favorite movie as
 me. E.T. It was like soul mates




E
 and that stuff you read about.

           PARKER
 So then... what happened?

            LYNCH
 Same old shit.
     (then)
 No. You know what happened? She
 liked another guy. This fucking
 fraternity douchebag named Dean who
 kept sending her flowers and stuff.
 I don't know who it was exactly,
 but every time I'd go to her room
 some guy named "Dean" had left her
 notes and shit.
                                        84.



           PARKER
 Why did she keep it? Was she
 trying to make you jealous?

           LYNCH
 I don't know. I think she just
 liked getting attention.




                                        X
           PARKER
 So she dumped you for a frat guy?

             LYNCH




                                      R
 No. I dumped her. We were in the
 cafeteria, right? And I was
 sitting facing her, facing the
 wall...and she was facing everyone
 in the cafeteria behind me. And I




                          A
 kept seeing her smiling at someone
 behind me and like, almost
 laughing. So I was like, "who are
 you laughing at?" You know? Like
 "what the hell is going on?" And
 she's like, "Dean's making fun of




              M
 you."
      (beat)
 So I turn around, and I'm like
 ready to kick the shit out of this
 guy. And all I see is a sea of
 fucking random people. Just all of
 these faces. This guy could see me
 and was making eyes with my




  D
 girlfriend...but I couldn't see
 him.

           PARKER
 That's messed up.




E
            LYNCH
 I've never felt so stupid and bad
 in my life.
     (then)
 So I left.

           PARKER
 You just walked out?

           LYNCH
 Yup. Told her to go laugh with
 "Dean the Frat guy". I was out.

           PARKER
 That sucks.
                                                          85.



                    LYNCH
          Maybe... maybe I shouldn't have
          been so quick to walk out. Maybe I
          needed to have a thicker skin and
          not be such a sensitive bitch, I
          don't know. Sometimes I think I
          was just insecure and maybe I




                                                  X
          screwed up.

                    PARKER
          You should call her. When you get
          home. You could tell her that.




                                                R
                    LYNCH
          I can't.
              (laughs)
          She's dating Dean.




                                   A
Emotion has fought it's way to the surface again.   Parker and
Lynch share a nervous laugh together.

She turns away from him.




                       M
After a few seconds, her laughs turn to tears.

                    PARKER
          I should have done something.

                    LYNCH
          There was nothing either of us
          could have done.




  D
                    PARKER
          I sat here and let him die.

                    LYNCH




E
          No, you didn't. We didn't let him
          die. There was nothing we could
          have done. He jumped down there to
          try and save us, OK?

                    PARKER
          He was the one. He was the boy I
          was gonna marry.

                    LYNCH
          Funny story. First grade, we all
          get left there for the day by our
          mom's. You know, alone in real
          school for the first time without
          our folks around. And Dan... Dan
          was this sort of chubby kid when he
          was little...
                                                    86.



Parker laughs.

                    LYNCH (cont'd)
          Nah, fuck it. He was a fat ass.

Parker laughs harder.




                                                    X
                    LYNCH (cont'd)
          And all the mom's left and he just
          wouldn't let go of his mom's hand.
          He just stood there after she left,
          at the front of the room, crying




                                                  R
          like a total pussy.

                    PARKER
          Sounds like Dan.




                                      A
                    LYNCH
          You have no idea. But then, the
          teacher... Mrs... What was her
          name? Mrs. Schifrin? She was
          trying everything to get the fat
          kid to stop crying. And so she




                          M
          says, "Well Dan, is there anyone
          else in the class that you know?"
          You know, like, "Maybe there's a
          friend you'd like to sit with?"
          And the fucker points right at me
          and says "him"! I had never seen
          this kid before in my life, you
          know? But for whatever reason, he




  D
          points right at me.

                    PARKER
          And so he had to sit with you?




E
                    LYNCH
          For a week! For my whole first
          week of school I'm sharing my
          little cubby desk with his fat ass!

Parker laughs through her tears.

                       LYNCH (cont'd)
          Douchebag.     I never let him forget
          it.

                    PARKER
          I loved him so much.

Lynch is determined.
                                                               87.



                         LYNCH
               But if he died only for you and me
               to give up and die up here, that's
               bullshit.

                         PARKER
               Yes.




                                                      X
                         LYNCH
               So I need you to pull it together,
               and we're gonna get out of this
               shit. We're gonna get out of this




                                                    R
               for Dan. Alright?

                         PARKER
               Yes.




                                        A
     Lynch bites his severely chapped lips.

                         LYNCH
               Help me up.

                                                       CUT TO:




                            M
77   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - MOMENTS LATER                              77
     Lynch feebly climbs up on the chair back and reaches up for
     the cables.

                         LYNCH




       D
               OK....let's try this again.

     He steadies himself on the chair, which sways in the wind.

     TIGHT ON the bolts connecting the arm to the cables.   The




     E
     metal is bending with a light squeaking sound.

                         PARKER
               Are you OK? Do you have it?

     Lynch just grunts as he reaches and tries to steady himself
     on the chair that is swinging at an odd angle under his
     weight.

     The camera swivels up to reveal his shaky feet trying to find
     footing on the chair back and the ground far below him.

                         LYNCH
               Rrruh!

     He pushes off hard and grabs on to the cabling.
                                                             88.



As his foot pushes fast on the chair, it swings at an
impossible angle.

TIGHT ON the connecting bolts as one of them SNAPS!

                         PARKER
          Oh my god!




                                                   X
The chair leans hard to the right side, forcing Parker to
slide down into what is now the bottom corner of the chair.

The chair is still in place, but it is now hanging by one




                                                 R
bolt and at a severe angle.

                         PARKER (cont'd)
          Joe!    JOE!




                                           A
Joe tries to look back over his shoulder, struggling to keep
himself on the cable against his own body weight and wet
clothing.

                      LYNCH
          Shit!    Hold on, just hold on!




                            M
Another grunt and Lynch makes another big move forward.

The camera booms up above him, shooting straight down at the
distance between his dangling body and the frozen ground.

Tight on his gloved hands as they slowly slide forward on the
metal cable.




  D
Lynch squeezes his eyes shut and takes another reach forward.

Behind him, Parker looks on in agony.      She is holding her
breath and whispering...




E
                    PARKER
              (whispered)
          Please God...please God....please
          God...

The metal arm above her groans under the pressure that the
one remaining bolt is under. Looking at the arm in this
state, it is especially eerie to imagine how these metal
chairs even stay attached to the cables in the first place.

Lynch takes another move forward.

                         LYNCH
          Rrrugh!
                                                         89.



                    PARKER
          You can do it. Please do it.

Lynch reaches forward again...and his hand slips on the icy
cable. He momentarily hangs by one arm.

                      LYNCH




                                               X
          Arrrrr!

                      PARKER
          JOE!




                                             R
He reaches up and grabs hold again...his strength is weaning.

                    LYNCH
              (through gritted teeth)
          Got it.




                                     A
Another few quick reaches forward and he is more than halfway
across to the next chair.

From Lynch's point of view we can see his feet floating above
the earth and hear the sound of his own heart beat. His own




                         M
pained breathing fills his ears.

It's only now that he sees two of the wolves watching him
from the bushes.

                    LYNCH (cont'd)
          Motherfucker.




  D
The wind blows hard against him, swaying his body back and
forth as he momentarily rests.

                    LYNCH (cont'd)
          I've got an audience.




E
Parker looks down, just in time to see one of the wolves duck
back into the bushes.

Her movement makes the chair groan harder. The cable twangs
loudly between Lynch's shaky movements and the twisted metal
that holds the arm in place.

                    PARKER
          The chair is gonna fall!

                      LYNCH
          No.    No it's not.

Slowly he makes his way the remaining distance and positions
himself over the other chair.
                                                          90.



He drops down onto it, sending shards of ice cascading down
into the snow below.

He quickly sits down, breathing heavy and clutching the sides
of the chair.

                       LYNCH (cont'd)




                                                    X
             Take that Jenny Bluth!

                       PARKER
             You made it!




                                                  R
                        LYNCH
             Not yet.   Halfway.

He looks behind him at the next chair. Just a few feet back
from it is the giant green lift pole... and a ladder!




                                         A
                        LYNCH (cont'd)
             Please.

He stands up on the chair and reaches up to the cable.   He is
weak.




                           M
Very weak.

                       LYNCH (cont'd)
             Parker. I want you to throw my
             extra pole as far as you can this
             way.




  D
She can't quite hear him.

                        PARKER
             What?




E
                       LYNCH
             I said THROW MY POLE AS FAR AS YOU
             CAN THIS WAY. When I get on the
             ground I'll need some defense.

Parker nods.

She takes Lynch's ski pole and tries to throw it as far as
she can back at him.

The action forces another terrifying metallic groan from the
arm above her, and her chair swings back and forth from the
motion.

                        PARKER
             Oh shit.
                                                           91.



The pole lands under the second chair, splitting the distance
between where she is and where the tree is.

                     PARKER (cont'd)
          Sorry.

                    LYNCH




                                                X
          Hey. Halfway to me is better than
          up there with you, right?
              (to himself)
          Shit.




                                              R
He starts to pull himself up again, but turns back to Parker
one more time.

The chair has settled down.




                                       A
                    LYNCH (cont'd)
          Stay perfectly still. I'm gonna
          get you home, OK?

He pulls himself up, straining hard.




                        M
                     LYNCH (cont'd)
          Rrrrugh!

This gets the wolves attention.

In the bushes their ears and eyes perk up to the sky,
watching their potential next meal grapple with the high wire
cable.




  D
With reserved strength, Lynch shimmies across the cable as
quickly as he can.

Back at Parker's chair, she eyes the bending metal bolt that




E
is keeping her from plunging to the ground.

Tears stream down her face again.

                    PARKER
              (whispered)
          Please god, don't let me fall.
          Don't let me fall.

He stops once to catch his breath, but begins moving as
quickly as possible.

Finally, he reaches the second chair behind them and drops
down into it.

Looking at the lift pole from this position, he can clearly
see that it wasn't as close to the chair as it looked.
                                                          92.



But it's possible.

                      LYNCH
          Shit.

Parker needs to yell to hear him now.




                                                   X
                      PARKER
          WHAT?

                      LYNCH
          NOTHING.




                                                 R
He assesses the situation.

It's going to take a big leap to try and get near the ladder
and he is winded beyond belief.




                                       A
                    PARKER
          WHAT'S WRONG?

                      LYNCH
          NOTHING.    I'M GONNA GO FOR IT, OK?




                         M
                      PARKER
          ...

                      LYNCH
                (to himself)
          OK.




  D
The two stare at each other from the distance.   Both of their
weather beaten faces are a mess.

Parker is buried in the corner of the chair closest to the
ground, holding on to the back of it to keep herself steady.




E
Stoically, Lynch turns away from her and takes a deep breath.

He climbs up onto the chair back and looks down.

Parker closes her eyes and prays.

The wolves below do not break their stare.   Their hungry eyes
are willing Lynch to fall from the chair.

It's now or never.

                      LYNCH (cont'd)
          Yaaaaugh!

He throws himself off of the chair and towards the ladder!
                                                                 93.



     He lands and hooks his arm around a rung. With a SNAP his
     arm dislocates from it's socket, but he is hooked on to the
     ladder!

                           LYNCH (cont'd)
               Rrrrugh!




                                                       X
                         PARKER
               YOU DID IT! YOU DID IT!

     With his bad arm dangling by his side, Lynch works his way
     down the icy metal ladder.




                                                     R
     Finally he reaches the ground and his body falls with a THUD
     into the snow.

                           LYNCH




                                            A
               Oooof!

     The wolves' ears are at attention.     They watch carefully from
     the safety of the bushes.

     One, the LEADER, takes a cautious single step forward and




                              M
     waits.

                          PARKER
               LYNCH!? LYNCH!!!
                   (then)
               ANSWER ME!!!

     The wolf leader begins a dangerously slow and cautious walk




       D
     towards Lynch's body.

     One step at a time.

                                                          CUT TO:

     As the camera tracks away from the approaching wolf and
     towards Lynch...it is revealed that he is only winded.

     He feels his body for damage, wincing at what can only be a
     broken rib or two. His right arm is twisted at an odd angle
     and by the look on Lynch's face, it must be either broken or
     fractured in addition to being dislocated.

                           LYNCH
               PARKER.

                         PARKER (O.C.)
               ARE YOU OK?
                                                                   94.



     The wolf surveys the situation and stops in his tracks.

     The other wolves watch from the bushes.

                         LYNCH
               I'M GONNA GO GET HELP.       I'M GONNA
               GET RESCUE.

     Lynch gets himself to his feet. His body is in massive pain,
     but his adrenaline is going strong enough for him to fight




                               M
     through it.

     He moves quickly back up to the area underneath the middle
     chair.

     The leader growls. Drool drips down from beneath it's hungry
     mouth as it takes a step back.




       D
                            PARKER (O.C.)
               NO!   JOE!

               I'M GONNA GET YOU HELP!




     E
     The wolf leader advances on Lynch.

     Lynch makes it to the ski pole just in time and brandishes it
     defensively at the creature.

                            LYNCH (cont'd)
               Come on!     Try something, fucker!

     The wolf stares back at him, growling.      Their eyes are
     locked.

     Lynch swings the pole at it angrily.

                            LYNCH (cont'd)
               COME ON!
                                                                 95.



     The leader shies away but growls harder.

                            LYNCH (cont'd)
               STAY AWAY!

     SNAP!




                                                      X
     A second wolf rushes Lynch from behind and grabs his injured
     arm by the jacket and pulls back and forth.

                            LYNCH (cont'd)
               ARGH!




                                                    R
     The rest of the wolves quickly reveal themselves in the
     bushes and slowly saunter up towards the impending kill.

     Lynch tries to fight off the wolf with his free arm.

     Finally, he is able to plunge the ski pole deep into the
     wolf's body.




     E
     The wolf SHRIEKS in pain and scampers away towards the safety
     of the pack.

     The impending wolves, stop their slow march and wait.   This
     food still has some fight left in it.

                           LYNCH
               AHHHHH!    STAY THE FUCK AWAY FROM
               ME!

     He moves as fast as he can towards the area under Parker's
     chair, swinging his weapon like a madman all the while.

     The wolves only stare.
                                                                   96.



     Finally, he reaches the area and grabs Dan's snowboard, still
     sticking up in the snow.

               Parker, I'm gonna go get help!
               Don't move and I'll be back as fast

     his body on top of it. Pushing off he begins to slide
     quickly down the hill.

     But mere seconds later, the pack of wolves gives chase and
     follow suit behind him over the horizon.

     Only the creaking of the strained metal chair arm can be

     Parker sobs quietly to herself.

     The morning sun hits Parker's pale face.   Is she dead?

     Parker opens her eyes. She must have drifted off for the
     night. She looks to the tree-line around her.

     The sun is coming up.

     She tries to move her body to look back in Lynch's direction
     and the chair argues back at her with another loud groan and
     cable noise.

               Lynch.

     There is no sign of anyone or anything in the direction down
     the hill behind her.

     Slowly a look of great determination comes over her face.




       D
     She raises the safety bar.

     There is no more time to think.




     E
     She is going to die one way or another.

     Slowly, Parker turns her body around towards the seat of the
     chair.

     Holding on to the metal beams that make up the chair, she
     beings to lower herself, inch by inch, off of the side.

     CREEEEE-EEK! The lone metal bolt protests the movement and
     makes metallic threats to snap.

     Parker keeps lowering herself until her entire lower body is
     dangling below the chair.

     RRRRRUUUUUURRR! A gust of wind pushes against the chair,
     straining the arm.
                                                            98.



Parker concentrates and slowly tries to hold up her weight as
she inches her body even lower.

Smoothly, slowly, almost there- SNAP!   The bolt gives way!

The chair lurches down at an even greater angle, sending
Parker off of the side!

chair falls several feet and then stops. It is now hanging
only by the one weak thread of cabling that was used to
initially wire it to the main line.

Parker's hands catch at the base of the chair, and she is




                                      A
dangling fully beneath it.

While it is still a long drop...her feet are now a good 10
feet closer to the ground, if not more.

CREEEEEK! The metal wire will not hold for more than a few




                          M
seconds. The chair is going to fall!

Parker closes her eyes.

All sound cuts out except for her quick breathing and her
heartbeat.

The camera shows us how much the last flimsy wire does not

like this movement as it stretches and the chair sways in the
wind.

Slowly she looks down and prepares herself to fall.




E
The camera inches closer in to her face from below.

Her heartbeat and breathing are all we hear until finally...

She let's go.

As her body falls from the chair, the flimsy wire finally
gives way and the rickety metal seat plummets straight down
to the ground after her.

     She rolls to the side as the chair crashes down in her very

                                                       X
     She is in tremendous pain but feels the solid ground beneath
     her like a sailor who has found land for the first time in
     years.

     Surveying the damage- her ankle is badly broken underneath




                                                     R
     the side of the chair that landed on it. Her boot is at an
     unnatural angle.

     Adrenaline overtakes her pain as she lifts the chair up and
     removes her foot from beneath it.




                                          A
     She looks around for her snow board, but with all of the
     fresh snowfall it is buried and gone.

     Parker lays her body down flat on her jacket and begins to
     push herself down the mountainside as quickly as she can.




                             M
                                                         CUT TO:


88   EXT. JUST OVER THE HILL - MORNING, CONTINUOUS                 88
     Parker comes down the hill, gaining some speed on her awkward
     coat/sled.




       D
     As she makes her way she spots a tree... with bright red
     blood splayed out in the snow around it.

     Cautiously she slows herself down.




     E
                         PARKER
                   (meekly)
               Joe...?

     From Parker's POV, the camera slowly reveals what is just
     beyond the bloody tree...

     But the look on Parker's face tells us everything we need to
     know first.

     There, in the brush on the side of the trail beyond the tree,
     is the pack of wolves.

     Some still feeding.   Others resting attentively.

     They are circled around Lynch's bloody, half-eaten remains.
                                                              100.



     Quick shots of his jacket, his boots, and his gloved hand all
     flash before Parker's devastated eyes.

     She slows herself to a complete stop now.   Not knowing what
     to do.

     One of the feeding wolves hears this and looks back to see


     Parker just a few feet away. It is the pack leader.

     Lynch's blood pools from it's jaws.

     It's ears go back and it growls loudly at Parker.




                                                   R
     She makes eye contact with the beast, who stares back at her,
     almost daring her to try and take it's treasure.

     Others from the pack look up, distracted briefly, but then go
     back to feeding.

     Parker and the pack leader lock eyes.

     Finally, the leader turns away from Parker, back to his food.

     Back to his family.

     Though her face is emotionless, Parker's eyes are swollen
     with tears as she continues on her way down the mountain
     side.

     She is free.


                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


89   EXT. MOUNT HOLLISTON - LATER                                 89

     Parker continues down the treacherous trail as the snow falls
     around her.

     Occasionally she hits bumps and turns that cause her to spill
     from her awkward coat/sled...but she pulls herself back on
     and continues to make her way down the hill stoically.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


90   EXT. CHAIR LIFT LINE - LATER                                 90
     Parker reaches the bottom of the hill.

     Grunting and crying from the pain, she crawls over on her
     belly and begins to drag herself towards the parking lot.
                                                              101.




91   EXT. ROAD - MOMENTS LATER                                     91
     Parker drags her devastated body into the street.

     Just as she gets there....




                                                    X
     BEEP! A HONKING CAR races past with it's windshield wipers
     blaring.

     Narrowly missing being splattered, she collapses in the dirty
     road.


     There are no more cars to be seen.

     She is alone.




                                          A
     All that she can do is clutch the ground.

     And then...

     Another car approaches in the distance.

     She holds her hand up weakly.

                          PARKER
               Please.   Stop.

                                                         CUT TO:





92   INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS                                         92
     A DRIVER (male, 50's) is cautiously driving down the wet icy
     road. He reaches down to adjust the radio.


     He looks back up to reveal Parker's body in the road in front
     of him.


93   EXT. ROADSIDE - CONTINUOUS                                    93
     He swerves with a loud SKID!

     Partially off the road in a skid, his car comes to a stop.

     Instantly he jumps out and runs to the body on the road.

                          DRIVER
               Hey!   Are you OK?!   Hello!

     Parker is not moving.
                                                               102.



     He runs over to her side.

                          DRIVER (cont'd)
               Lady.   Are you alright?

     Parker looks up at him and starts to cry with relief.




                                                      X
                         DRIVER (cont'd)
               Hold on, hold on- we're gonna get
               you help...

     He lifts her up into his arms and races her back to his car.




                                                       CUT TO:


94   INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER                                    94



     The driver drives frantically, speaking into his cell phone.

                         DRIVER
                   (into phone)
               I don't know. I found her laying
               in the road alone. Looks like she
               was in some sort of accident.
               Right outside of Mount Holliston.
               I'm taking her to you now.



95   EXT. CAR, LOOKING IN - CONTINUOUS                           95

     Through the passenger side window we see Parker's blank face.

     If we didn't know better, we'd think she was a rotten cadaver
     at this point.

     Reflected in the glass are the lights of a PAPA GINO'S
     restaurant store front that goes past.

     Her eyes blink at the sign.

                         DRIVER
               Hold on, Ma'am. The hospital is 10
               minutes away. You're gonna be OK.

     The camera is tighter on her eyes.

                         DRIVER (cont'd)
               You're gonna be OK.

     Tight on just one eye.
                                                 103.



                    DRIVER (cont'd)
              (now in Dan's voice)
          You're gonna be OK, baby.

Her eye closes.

                                      CUT TO BLACK.
