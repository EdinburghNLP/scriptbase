Don Birnam, long-time alcoholic, has been "on the wagon" for ten days and seems to be over the worst; but his craving has just become more insidious.
Evading a country weekend planned by his brother Wick and girlfriend Helen, he begins a four-day bender.
In flashbacks we see past events, all gone wrong because of the bottle.
But this bout looks like being his last...one way or the other.
