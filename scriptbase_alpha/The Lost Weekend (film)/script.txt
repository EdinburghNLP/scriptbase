                    SEQUENCE "A"

FADE IN:

A-1 THE MAN-MADE MOUNTAIN PEAKS OF MANHATTAN

on a sunny day in October, 1938. THE CAMERA PANS ACROSS the 
distant ridge of midtown buildings, then slowly FINDS A 
FOREGROUND: THE REAR OF A SMALL APARTMENT HOUSE on East 55th 
Street.

It is a 4-story affair of brick, housing some eight 
apartments, half of them giving on the garden or rather on 
the routine back yard with a sumac tree, a stone bench, and 
some mouldy flower boxes in which geraniums are dying.

THE MOVING CAMERA CONCENTRATES on the 4th-floor apartment, 
which boasts three windows. Two of them give on the living 
room, one on the bedroom of the brothers Birnam. THE CAMERA 
NARROWS its interest to THE BEDROOM WINDOW.

It is open, like a million other windows in New York that 
warm day. What gives it individuality is that from an awning 
cleat there dangles down the outside wall something which 
very few people hang from their windows: a bottle of whiskey.

Through the window we can see the brothers Birnam packing.

A-2 INT. BEDROOM

It is a smallish room with twin beds in opposite corners, 
both of them unmade. There are books on the night tables, 
two chests of drawers with some of the drawers open, and the 
closet is open too. One door leads to the living room, another 
to the cramped entrance hall.

(Maybe this is the time to describe the apartment. You've 
seen that living room a hundred times if you know literate, 
artistically inclined people. On one wall are bookshelves 
surrounding a marble fireplace, on which stands a tiny plaster 
bust of Shakespeare. In the shelves, art books and serious 
works of fiction: Thomas Mann, F. Scott Fitzgerald, James 
Joyce and the like. There are Picasso, Van Gogh and Utrillo 
reproductions on the other walls. A comfortable, elderly 
armchair stands near one of the windows. There is a studio 
couch, a low, tiled table -- oh, you know.

Off the living room is the familiar kitchenette for the light 
housekeeping of two bachelors -- i.e. coffee and coffee.

The bathroom, inconveniently enough, is off the entrance 
hall. A floor plan, authenticated by the author of the book, 
will be furnished on request).

To get back to the bedroom and the Birnam brothers: a small 
suitcase lies open on each bed. DON, the brother nearest the 
window, is bent over one, putting in socks, shirts, etc. He 
is thirty-three, an extremely attractive guy, but ten pounds 
underweight, and in his eye there is something rebellious, 
something sly.

WICK, two years younger, is much sturdier, kindly, 
sympathetic, solid gold. He wears glasses and is smoking a 
cigarette. He is on his way from the closet to his suitcase 
with some stuff. He throws a sweater across to Don.

               WICK
     Better take this along, Don. It's 
     going to be cold on the farm.

               DON
     Okay.

               WICK
     How many shirts are you taking?

               DON
     Three.

               WICK
     I'm taking five.

               DON
     Five?

               WICK
     I told them at the office I might 
     not be back till Tuesday. We'll get 
     there this afternoon. That'll give 
     us all Friday, Saturday, Sunday, 
     Monday. We'll make it a long weekend.

               DON
     Sounds long, all right.

               WICK
     It'll do you good, Don, after what 
     you've been through.

Don has crossed to the chest of drawers and fished out more 
shirts and socks.

               WICK
     Trees and grass and sweet cider and 
     buttermilk and water from that well 
     that's colder than any other water.

               DON
     Wick, please, why this emphasis on 
     liquids? Noble, upstanding, nauseating 
     liquids.

               WICK
     Sorry, Don.

DON, his back toward Wick, is bent over the suitcase, packing. 
His eyes travel to the window.

               DON
     Think it would be a good idea if we 
     took my typewriter?

               WICK
     What for?

               DON
          (Indignantly)
     To write. To write there. I'm going 
     to get started on my novel.

               WICK
     You really feel up to writing?

               DON
     Why not?

               WICK
     I mean, after what you've been 
     through.

               DON
     I haven't touched the stuff for ten 
     days now.

               WICK
     I know you haven't. Where's the 
     portable?

               DON
     In the living room closet, kind of 
     towards the back.

Bent forward tensely, he watches Wick go into the living 
room. Left alone, he acts with lightning rapidity. He takes 
the sweater, goes over to the window, pulls up the whiskey 
bottle, wraps the sweater around it so that only the top 
with the string around it shows. He tries to loosen the noose 
but he's nervous and loses a precious second.

From the living room has been coming the sound of Wick opening 
the closet door and ransacking. Now comes:

               WICK'S VOICE
     You sure it's in the closet? I can't 
     find it.

               DON
          (Working desperately)
     Look by the big chair.

               WICK'S VOICE
          (Approaching fast)
     Isn't it under your bed?

Don sees he can't loosen the string in time. In the last 
fraction of a second before Wick enters, he manages to lower 
the bottle back down the wall. With what nonchalance he can 
muster he bends down and looks under the bed just as Wick 
enters, a sheaf of white paper in his hand.

               DON
     Of course. Here it is.

He pulls out a Remington portable, 1930 model.

               WICK
     Here's some paper.

He puts it in Don's suitcase.

               WICK
     We'll fix a table on the south porch. 
     Nobody to disturb you -- I'll see to 
     it. Except maybe Saturday night we'll 
     go over to the Country Club.

               DON
     I'm not going near that Country Club.

               WICK
     Why not?

               DON
     Because they're a bunch of hypocrites 
     and I don't like to be whispered 
     about: Look who's here from New York. 
     The Birnam brothers -- or rather the 
     nurse and the invalid.

               WICK
     Stop that, Don. Nobody there knows 
     about you.

               DON
     No? We get off the train and the 
     alarm is sounded: The leper is back. 
     Better hide your liquor.

Footsteps have been racing up the stairs outside the flat, 
and now there is a distinctive ring of the doorbell: short, 
short, long, short.

               DON
     Helen.

               WICK
     I'll take it.

He goes toward the door while the bell resumes short, short, 
long, short.

From the bedroom we see him open the door. It's HELEN, all 
right. She is a clean-cut, good looking girl of twenty-six. 
Her face is brave, gay piquant. She's wearing a three-quarter-
length leopard coat. The Indian Summer day is a good ten 
degrees too warm for the coat, but that doesn't stop Helen 
from wearing her beloved. In her hand are two books wrapped, 
and another small package. She enters breathlessly.

               HELEN
     Hello, Wick. Where's Don?

Seeing him, she crosses to the bedroom.

               HELEN
     Glad I made it. I was afraid you 
     might be gone. Presents.

She puts the packages in the suitcase.

               HELEN
     The new Thurber book, with comical 
     jokes and pictures, and a quiet little 
     double murder by Agatha Christie.
          (Putting in the second 
               package)
     Cigarettes and chewing gum.

               DON
     Thanks, Helen.

               HELEN
     Now have a good time, darling. And 
     remember -- lots of sleep, lots of 
     milk --

               DON
     And sweet cider and some of that 
     nice cold water from the well.

               HELEN
     Bend down.

It's a running gag between these two. Don bends so that she 
can kiss him on the cheek.

               HELEN
     I'd better be going. I've missed ten 
     minutes of the concert already.

               DON
     What concert?

               HELEN
     Carnegie Hall. Barbirolli conducting. 
     They gave me two tickets at the 
     office.

               DON
     Who are you going with?

               HELEN
     Nobody.

Something flickers in Don's eye.

               DON
     What are they playing?

               HELEN
     Brahms' Second Symphony, something 
     by Beethoven, something by Handel, 
     and not one note of Grieg.

               DON
     Sounds wonderful.

               HELEN
     Goodbye, boys. See you Monday.

               WICK
     Tuesday.

               DON
          (Holding Helen by the 
               arm)
     Just a minute. Wick --

Wick looks up.

               DON
     I just had a crazy idea.

               WICK
     As for instance.

               DON
     Who says we have to take the two-
     forty-five train? We could go on the 
     six-thirty.

               WICK
     What are you talking about?

               DON
     I just thought we could take a later 
     train and Helen wouldn't have to go 
     alone to the concert. She's got two 
     tickets, hasn't she?

               HELEN
     No. I'm not upsetting any plans. 
     You're going on that two-forty-five.

               DON
     But Helen, it's so silly! A whale of 
     a concert and an empty seat next 
     you.

               WICK
     No, Don. Everything's all set. They'll 
     be at the station to meet us. 
     Dinner'll be waiting.

               DON
     So what? We put in a call that we're 
     taking the late train, have supper 
     at nine o'clock, be in bed by ten.

               WICK
     Nothing doing. We're going.

               HELEN
     Wick's right. And don't worry about 
     that empty seat. I'll find myself a 
     very handsome South American 
     millionaire.

               DON
     There. Did you hear her? And now 
     we'd have to break our necks to catch 
     the train anyway.

               HELEN
          (Looking at her wrist 
               watch)
     Two-twenty.

               DON
     See?

               WICK
          (Giving up)
     All right. Go ahead.

               DON
     Wait a minute. I'm not going.

               WICK
     Then what are we talking about?

               DON
     I want you to go. You and Helen.

               WICK
     Me and Helen?

               DON
     Yes. That was the idea. Who likes 
     Brahms, you or I?

               WICK
     Since when don't you like Brahms?

               DON
     I'll stay right here and finish 
     packing. Take a little nap maybe.

               WICK
     Nonsense. If anybody goes... Helen's 
     your girl.

There is an exchange of suspicious looks between Wick and 
Helen.

               HELEN
     There's something in that, Don.

               WICK
     What's more, I don't think you should 
     be left alone.

               DON
     I shouldn't?

               WICK
     No.

               HELEN
     Really, Don.

               DON
     Why? I can't be trusted. Is that it?

               WICK
     What I meant to say --

               HELEN
     Wick.

               WICK
     After what Don's been through --

               DON
     After what I've been through, I 
     couldn't go to a concert. I couldn't 
     face the crowd. I couldn't sit through 
     it with all those people around. I 
     want to be alone for a couple of 
     hours and kind of assemble myself. 
     Is that such an extraordinary thing 
     to want?

               WICK
     Don't act so outraged, would you 
     mind?

               DON
     All right. Anything else?

               HELEN
     Please, boys.

Wick, who has been smoking a cigarette throughout the scene, 
throws it out the window. None of the three see, but we do, 
that it doesn't fall out the window but ricochets against 
the opened casement to the window sill, where it lies 
smouldering.

               WICK
     Come on, Helen.

               HELEN
     You'll stay right here, won't you?

               DON
     Where would I go?

               HELEN
     Then you'll be here when we come 
     back?

               DON
     I told you I'm not leaving this 
     apartment.

               WICK
     You've told us a good many things, 
     Don.

Furious, Don takes a bunch of keys from his pocket.

               DON
     All right, if you don't believe me, 
     why don't you take my key and lock 
     me in like a dog.

               HELEN
          (To Wick)
     We've got to trust Don. That's the 
     only way.

               WICK
     Sorry, Don.
          (To Helen)
     Here we go.

               HELEN
     So long, Don.

               DON
     So long.

               HELEN
          (Pulling him by the 
               lapel)
     Bend down.

His face is now close to hers. She kisses him. Wick turns 
away. His eyes fall on the cigarette still smouldering on 
the sill. He goes toward the window.

Don, held by Helen, watches him tensely. Wick flips the 
cigarette into the garden and is about to turn back into the 
room when his eyes fall on the cleat and the string. He leans 
from the window.

Don lets Helen go, staring at Wick, panic in his eyes. Helen, 
sensing something amiss, looks from one brother to the other.

               WICK
          (Hauling up the bottle)
     What's this, Don?

Helen and Wick watch Don. Don's face relaxes into an innocent 
grin.

               DON
     That? That's whiskey, isn't it?

               WICK
     How did it get there?

               DON
     I don't know.

               WICK
     I suppose it dropped from some cloud. 
     Or someone was bouncing it against 
     this wall and it got stuck.

               DON
     I must have put it there.

               WICK
     Yes, you must.

               DON
     Only I don't remember when. Probably 
     during my last spell, or maybe the 
     one before.

His eyes meet Helen's. Hers are infinitely distressed.

               DON
     Don't look at me like that, Helen. 
     Doesn't mean a thing. I didn't know 
     it was there. And if I had, I wouldn't 
     have touched it.

Wick has twisted the string off the bottle.

               WICK
     Then you won't mind.

               DON
     Won't mind what?

Wick, the bottle in his hand, goes through the living room 
toward the kitchenette. Don looks after him, then follows 
him, a stubborn smile on his lips. Helen trails after them, 
acutely embarrassed.

A-3 KITCHENETTE

Wick has stepped to the sink. He opens the bottle, turns it 
upside down and lets the whiskey run out. Don and Helen come 
to the door from the living room and stand watching. Don has 
something of the feeling of a man watching the execution of 
a very good friend, but he senses Helen's eyes upon him and 
preserves his nonchalant expression. The bottle emptied, 
Wick puts it in the sink.

               WICK
     Now you trot along with Helen.

               DON
     Why? On account of that?
          (Pointing at the bottle)
     You think I wanted you out of the 
     apartment because of that? I resent 
     that like the devil, and if there's 
     one more word of discussion, I don't 
     leave on your blasted weekend.

               HELEN
     Let's go.

Wick shrugs and goes to the hall for his hat.

               HELEN
          (To Don)
     Be good, won't you, Don, darling?

She turns to go, but Don holds her back.

               DON
     Of course, Helen. Just stop watching 
     me all the time, you two. Let me 
     work it out my way. I'm trying, I'm 
     trying.

               HELEN
     We're both trying, Don. You're trying 
     not to drink, and I'm trying not to 
     love you.

She kisses him on the mouth, a woman hopelessly in love. 
Then, so that he won't see her moist eyes, she turns and 
hurries into the entrance hall.

A-4 LITTLE ENTRANCE HALL - BIRNAM APARTMENT

Wick stands, hat in hand, holding the door open. Helen comes 
out quickly and taking a handkerchief from her bag, hurries 
past Wick into the hall. Wick turns toward Don, who has 
followed Helen to the entrance hall.

               WICK
     You call the farm, Don. Tell them 
     we're taking the six-thirty train.

               DON
     Sure.

               WICK
     So long.

He goes out, shutting the door behind him. Don steps quickly 
to the door, presses his ear against it to hear what the two 
are saying outside.

A-5 FOURTH FLOOR HALL AND STAIRCASE - APARTMENT HOUSE

It is narrow and simple. There is no elevator. A skylight, 
somewhat obscured by dirt and dust, lights the fourth floor 
back. Every so often down the stair there is a light bracket, 
always burning.

Helen stands at the top of the stairs, blowing her nose. 
Wick takes her arm quickly.

               WICK
     Come on, Helen.

               HELEN
     Oh, Wick, what are we going to do 
     about him ever.

               WICK
     He'll be all right.

               HELEN
     What if he goes out and buys another 
     bottle?

               WICK
     With what? He hasn't a nickel. There 
     isn't a store, there isn't a bar 
     that'd give him five cents' worth of 
     credit.

They descend a few steps.

               HELEN
     Are you sure he hasn't another bottle 
     hidden somewhere?

               WICK
     Not any more, he hasn't. I went 
     through the apartment with a fine-
     toothed comb. The places he can figure 
     out!

They go on down the stairs.

A-6 INT. THE APARTMENT

Don stands at the door, panic in his face. Has his brother 
discovered the other two bottles? He puts the chain on the 
door to insure his privacy, then dashes into the bathroom.

A-7 BATHROOM - BIRNAM APARTMENT

It's old-fashioned, with a bath tub on claw feet, a shower 
cutain above it -- all the plumbing on that scale. Don dashes 
in, takes a nail file, kneels beside the grille of a register 
in the side wall, pries it out with the file, looks inside, 
puts his hand in. The bottle is gone. He looks at the hole 
wide-eyed, pushes back the grille and runs out.

A-8

Don comes running in, goes to the couch, pulls it away from 
the wall, throws himself on his belly on the couch and reaches 
under the side of it which was towards the wall. His hand 
explores among the springs. There is no bottle there. He 
sits up. His face is covered with sweat. He takes out his 
handkerchief and wipes his face.

Just then, from the direction of the entrance door, there is 
the noise of a key being turned in the lock. Don freezes, 
his eyes turning towards the door, horrified.

A-9 ENTRANCE DOOR TO THE APARTMENT (FROM DON'S ANGLE)

It opens as far as the chain will allow, stops with a sharp 
bite of metal on wood. There is another try. Then the doorbell 
is rung.

He has not stirred. He rises slowly from the couch, takes a 
few steps towards the entrance door.

               DON
     Who is it?

No answer. Just the doorbell being rung again.

               DON
     WHO IS IT?

A-11 CORRIDOR OUTSIDE BIRNAM APARTMENT

At the door stands MRS. FOLEY, a middle-aged charwoman with 
a large utility bag over her arm. Her key is in the door, 
which is open as far as the chain will permit.

               MRS. FOLEY
     Mrs. Foley. Come to clean up.

A-12 DON

               DON
          (His nerves on edge)
     Not today. Does it have to be today?

A-13 MRS. FOLEY

               MRS. FOLEY
     I ought to change the sheets, and 
     today's my day to vacuum.

A-14 DON

               DON
     You can't come in. I'm not dressed.

A-15 MRS. FOLEY

               MRS. FOLEY
     Shall I wait, shall I come back, or 
     what?

               DON'S VOICE
     You come on Monday.

               MRS. FOLEY
     All right, Mr. Birnam. Is your brother 
     here?

               DON'S VOICE
     No, he isn't.

               MRS. FOLEY
     How about my money? Didn't he leave 
     my money?

A-16 DON

He stands galvanized. The word "money" has sent an electric 
current through his mind.

               DON
     What money?

               MRS. FOLEY
     My five dollars. Didn't he leave it?

               DON
          (Stalking his prey)
     Probably. Where would he leave it?

               MRS. FOLEY'S VOICE
     In the kitchen.

               DON
     Where in the kitchen?

               MRS. FOLEY'S VOICE
     In the sugar bowl.

Don breathes like one who's found the combination to the 
safe with the crown jewels.

               DON
     Just a minute.

He goes to the kitchenette.

A-17 KITCHENETTE

On the counter under the cupboards stands the sugar bowl. 
Don lifts the lid. There's nothing but sugar in the bowl, 
but lining the lid is a folded five-dollar bill. Don takes 
it out, goes into the entrance hall and even though Mrs. 
Foley can't see him, instinctively holds the five dollars 
behind his back.

               DON
     Sorry, Mrs. Foley. It's not there. 
     He must have forgotten.

A-18 MRS. FOLEY

               MRS. FOLEY
     Oh, Putt! I wanted to do some 
     shopping.

               DON'S VOICE
     You'll get it Monday all right.

               MRS. FOLEY
     Goodbye, Mr. Birnam.

She closes the door, takes the key and starts down the stairs.

A-19 DON

He brings the five dollars from behind his back. He looks at 
it, folds it neatly, pockets it, puts on his hat, then, with 
an afterthought, goes into the living room. He pushes the 
couch back against the wall with his foot, then goes out.

A-20 FOURTH FLOOR HALL AND STAIRS

Don goes to the balustrade, looks down.

A-21 STEEP SHOT OF THE STAIRS

Don's head in the foreground. The coast is clear of Mrs. 
Foley. Like a convict escaping, Don slips down the stairs.

                                             SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

A-22 BROPHY'S LIQUOR STORE - (TRANSP.) - CLOSE SHOT OF LIQUOR 
BOTTLES

A rackful of them, filling the screen. THE CAMERA IS BEHIND 
the rack of liquor in a store on Third Avenue. THE CAMERA 
MOVES slowly toward them so that only about eight bottles 
fill the screen and we can see, between them, the shop, its 
window on Third Avenue, its entrance door. No one is visible 
in the shop.

Through the glass door we see Don Birnam hurrying up. He 
gives a quick glance in each direction, to see that he's not 
observed. He peers into the shop to make sure there are no 
other customers, then quickly steps inside and stands 
breathing heavily.

A salesman rises in the foreground, his back to the CAMERA. 
Don points to two bottles in the foreground.

               DON
          (With all the 
               nonchalance he can 
               scrape together)
     Two bottles of rye.

               SALESMAN
     I'm sorry, Mr. Birnam.

               DON
     What are you sorry about?

               SALESMAN
     Your brother was in here. He said 
     he's not going to pay for you any 
     more. That was the last time.

               DON
     He won't, huh?

He takes the five dollars from his pocket and unfurls it, 
like a card trickster.

               DON
     Two bottles of rye.

               SALESMAN
     What brand?

               DON
     You know what brand, Mr. Brophy. The 
     cheapest.

               SALESMAN
     All right.

               DON
     None of that twelve-year-old, aged-
     in-the-wood chichi. Not for me. Liquor 
     is all one, anyway.

The salesman has taken two bottles from the rack in the 
foreground and put them on the counter. Don gives him the 
money and picks up the bottles like a miser grabbing gold.

               SALESMAN
     Don't you want a bag?

               DON
     Yes, I want a bag.

The salesman hands him a bag and steps out of the shot towards 
the cash register. We hear the ping of its bell, the opening 
of its drawer. Meanwhile, Don thrusts the bottles in the 
bag. It is a little short and the necks of the bottles 
protrude. The salesman hands him his change. Don pockets it.

               SALESMAN
     You know, your brother asked me not 
     to sell you anything even if you had 
     money, but I can't stop nobody, can 
     I, not unless you're a minor.

               DON
     I'm not a minor, Mr. Brophy, and 
     just to quiet your conscience, I'm 
     buying this as a refill for my 
     cigarette lighter.

Another customer enters the shop. Don takes the package and 
walks past the newcomer towards the door, hiding it from him 
gracefully, like a football in a sneak play.

A-23 THIRD AVENUE, OUTSIDE BROPHY'S LIQUOR SHOP

Don comes out with the bottles in the paper bag. He wants to 
start down the street but about twenty-five feet away stand 
two middle-aged Hokinson ladies, one of them kerbing her dog 
on a leash. They are chatting.

Don stops. He'll have to pass them if he goes down the street 
and he doesn't want to, not with these bottles peeking out 
of that bag. He turns back and approaches the grocery store 
next door to Brophy's. In front of it is a fruit stand. 
Screening his gesture from the ladies with his back, he picks 
up three apples and puts them in the top of the bag, to 
camouflage the bottles. He puts down a coin, then walks down 
the street toward the ladies, flaunting a paper bag which is 
obviously full of apples.

The lady with the dog sees him. Don removes his hat in a 
courtly bow, very much at ease with the apples.

               DON
     Good afternoon, Mrs. Deveridge.

               MRS. DEVERIDGE
     Hello, Mr. Birnam.

Don passes the ladies.

               MRS. DEVERIDGE
          (Confidentially, to 
               her companion)
     That's that nice young man that 
     drinks.

The other lady tsk-tsks. They both look after Don.

Don is about ten feet beyond them. Perhaps he has overheard 
the remark. In any case, he is looking back. His look meets 
theirs. Embarrassed, they turn. Mrs. Deveridge jerks on the 
leash.

               MRS. DEVERIDGE
     Come on, Sophie. Let's go.

They walk down the street in the opposite direction from 
Don.

A-24 DON

He looks after them. He is just in front of NAT'S BAR. He 
steps hurriedly into the bar.

A-25 INT. NAT'S BAR

A typical dingy Third Avenue bar. The sun slants dustily 
into the walnut-brown room. There is a long bar with a mirror 
behind it, some marble-topped tables and bentwood chairs. 
The woodwork, the furniture, the plaster of the place have 
absorbed and give forth a sour breath of hard liquor, a stale 
smell of flat beer.

As Don enters with the two bottles and the apples, there are 
three people in the bar. Nat, the bartender, a broad-
shouldered, no-nonsense type of guy, squeezing lemons in 
preparation for the evening trade; and, sitting at a table 
in the corner, a girl named GLORIA, with an out-of-towner 
who hasn't bothered to take off his hat. He's about fifty 
and the manager of a hardware store in Elizabeth, New Jersey. 
Gloria is a shopworn twenty-three. She's brunette, wears net 
stockings and a small patent leather hat, and is a little 
below the standards of the St. Moritz lobby trade.

Don crosses to the bar.

               DON
     And how is my very good friend Nat 
     today?

               NAT
          (On guard)
     Yes, Mr. Birnam.

Don sits on a bar stool, putting down the paper bag.

               DON
     This being an especially fine 
     afternoon, I have decided to ask for 
     your hand in marriage.

               NAT
          (Wiping his hands)
     Look, Mr. Birnam --

               DON
     If that is your attitude, Nat, I 
     shall have to drown my sorrows in a 
     jigger of rye. Just one, that's all.

               NAT
     Can't be done, Mr. Birnam.

               DON
     Can't? Let me guess why. My brother 
     was here, undermining my financial 
     structure.

               NAT
     I didn't tell him nothing about the 
     wrist watch you left here, or your 
     cuff links.

               DON
     Thank you, Nat. Today, you'll be 
     glad to know, we can barter on a 
     cash basis.

He takes the bills and change from his pocket, puts it on 
the bar.

               NAT
          (Reaching for the 
               bottle and the jigger)
     One straight rye.

               DON
     That was the idea.

Nat pours the drink, then returns to squeezing lemons. Don 
picks up the glass, is suddenly acutely aware of the people 
at the table, of Nat's eyes. The glass freezes halfway to 
his mouth. He puts it down and starts playing the nonchalant, 
casual drinker -- the man who can take it or leave it. He 
fingers the glass, turning it round and round. He takes a 
pack of cigarettes from his pocket and shakes one out, lights 
it. As he puts the match in the ashtray, his eyes fall on 
that jigger of whiskey. It's hard to resist it any longer. 
He takes a handkerchief from his pocket, wipes his forehead, 
then his parched mouth. The time has come now. He puts the 
handkerchief back in his pocket, lifts the glass and drains 
it in one gulp. Actually, Don doesn't like the taste of 
liquor, actively hates it indeed, as a one-legged man might 
hate the sight of his crutches but need them in order to 
walk.

Now that he has the drink in him, a kind of relieved grin 
comes back to Don's face. He holds the empty jigger in his 
hand. Nat has come up with the bar towel to wipe off the wet 
ring left by the glass.

               DON
     Don't wipe it away, Nat. Let me have 
     my little vicious circle. The circle 
     is the perfect geometric figure. No 
     end, no beginning... What time is 
     it?

               NAT
     Quarter of four.

               DON
     Good. That gives us the whole 
     afternoon together.
          (He holds out his 
               glass for another 
               drink)
     Only remind me when it's a quarter 
     of six. Very important. We're going 
     to the country for a weekend, my 
     brother and I.

From the table in the background comes Gloria, headed for 
the powder room. Passing Don, she runs her finger through 
the neckline of his hair.

               GLORIA
     Hello, Mr. Birnam. Glad to have you 
     back with the organization.

               DON
     Hello, Gloria.

She goes on. Don turns back to Nat.

               DON
     Not just a Saturday-Sunday weekend. 
     A very long weekend. I wish I could 
     take you along, Nat. You --
          (With a gesture towards 
               the liquor shelves)
     and all that goes with you.

Without a change of expression, Nat pours the second drink.

               DON
     Not that I'm cutting myself off from 
     civilization altogether.

He points at the bag with the apples showing. Nat looks, but 
doesn't get it. Like a magician, Don takes two apples out, 
revealing the necks of the bottles.

               DON
          (Gulping down the 
               whiskey)
     Now of course there arises the problem 
     of transportation into the country. 
     How to smuggle these two time bombs 
     past the royal guard. I shall tell 
     you how, Nat, because I'm so fond of 
     you. Only give me another drink.

Nat pours one.

               DON
     I'm going to roll one bottle in a 
     copy of the Saturday Evening Post, 
     so my brother can discover it like 
     that.
          (He snaps his fingers)
     And I want him to discover it, because 
     that'll set his mind at rest. The 
     other bottle --
          (Confidentially to 
               Nat)
     Come here.

Nat leans over the bar towards --

               DON
     That one I'm tucking into my dear 
     brother's suitcase. He'll transport 
     it himself, without knowing it, of 
     course. While he's greeting the care-
     taker, I'll sneak it out and hide it 
     in a hollow of the old apple tree.

               NAT
     Aw, Mr. Birnam, why don't you lay 
     off the stuff for a while.

               DON
     I may never touch it while I'm there. 
     Not a drop. What you don't understand, 
     all of you, is that I've got to know 
     it's around. That I can have it if I 
     need it. I can't be cut off 
     completely. That's the devil. That's 
     what drives you crazy.

               NAT
     Yeah. I know a lot of guys like that. 
     They take a bottle and put it on the 
     shelf. All they want is just to look 
     at it. They won't even carry a cork-
     screw along, just to be sure. Only 
     all of a sudden they grab the bottle 
     and bite off the neck.

               DON
     Nat, one more reproving word and I 
     shall consult our lawyer about a 
     divorce.

He points to the empty glass for Nat to fill it. Nat pours 
another jigger.

               DON
     Quarter of six. Don't forget. My 
     brother must find me at home, ready 
     and packed.

Gloria is back from the powder room. On her way to her 
gentleman friend at the table, she runs her finger through 
the neckline of Don's hair. She is almost past him when he 
catches her hand and pulls her towards him.

               DON
     Shall we dance?

               GLORIA
     You're awfully pretty, Mr. Birnam.

               DON
     You say that to all the boys.

               GLORIA
     Why, natch. Only with you it's on 
     the level.

               DON
     Is it? Whatever became of your 
     manicurist job?

               GLORIA
     I've still got it. Only I find I 
     can't work more than four hours a 
     day, three days a week. It's too 
     tough on your eyes, all those little 
     hangnails.

               DON
     Sit down.

               GLORIA
     No thanks. Thanks a lot, but no 
     thanks. There's somebody waiting.

Don looks off toward the table.

               DON
     Him? I bet he wears arch supporters.

               GLORIA
     He's just an old friend of the folks. 
     Lovely gentleman. Buys me dimpled 
     Scotch.

               DON
     He should buy you Indian rubies, and 
     a villa in Calcutta overlooking the 
     Ganges.

               GLORIA
     Don't be ridic.

               DON
     Gloria, please, why imperil our 
     friendship with these loathsome 
     abbreviations.

               GLORIA
     I could make myself free for later 
     on if you want.

               DON
     I'm leaving for the weekend, Gloria. 
     Maybe another time.

               GLORIA
     Any time.

And as she leans over, she runs her forefinger again through 
the neckline of his hair.

               GLORIA
     Just crazy about the back of your 
     hair.

She returns to the table. Don drinks his drink, puts down 
the glass.

               DON
          (To Nat)
     Nat, weave me another.

               NAT
     You'd better take it easy.

               DON
     Don't worry about me. Just let me 
     know when it's a quarter of six.

               NAT
     Okay.

He pours.

               DON
     And have one yourself, Nat.

               NAT
     Not me, Mr. Birnam.

               DON
     I often wonder what the barman buys, 
     one-half so precious as the stuff he 
     sells.

Nat has poured the drink. Don points at it.

               DON
     Come on, Nat. One little jigger of 
     dreams.

               NAT
     Nope.

               DON
     You don't approve of drinking?

               NAT
     Not the way you drink.

               DON
     It shrinks my liver, doesn't it, 
     Nat? It pickles my kidneys. Yes. But 
     what does it do to my mind? It tosses 
     the sandbags overboard so the balloon 
     can soar. Suddenly I'm above the 
     ordinary. I'm competent, supremely 
     competent. I'm walking a tightrope 
     over Niagara Falls. I'm one of the 
     great ones. I'm Michelangelo moulding 
     the beard of Moses. I'm Van Gogh, 
     painting pure sunlight. I'm Horowitz 
     playing the Emperor Concerto. I'm 
     John Barrymore before the movies got 
     him by the throat. I'm a holdup man -- 
     I'm Jesse James and his two brothers, 
     all three of them. I'm W. Shakespeare. 
     And out there it's not Third Avenue 
     any longer. It's the Nile. The Nile, 
     Nat, and down it moves the barge of 
     Cleopatra. Listen: Purple the sails, 
     and so perfumed that The winds were 
     love-sick with them; the oars were 
     silver, Which to the tune of flutes 
     kept stroke, and made The water which 
     they beat to follow faster, As amorous 
     of their strokes. For her own person, 
     It beggar'd all description.

During the last two lines he has picked up the jigger of 
rye. THE CAMERA is on the wet rings which the wet glass has 
left on the bar.

Gradually the music swells under the Shakespearean quotation 
and drowns it out. In two QUICK DISSOLVES we see the five 
rings, then six, then nine. Over the last, the light has 
changed.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

A-26 THE BAR AGAIN

It is dusk. The electric lights are on. The place is about 
half filled -- eight customers at the bar, five tables 
occupied. Gloria and her friend are still there.

Don, an empty jigger in his hand, stands at the same spot, 
only now leaning with his back against the bar. He is doggedly 
quoting Shakespeare, more to himself than to the others at 
the bar, who are ignoring him.

               DON
     The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous 
     palaces, The solemn temples, the 
     great globe itself --

Nat puts drinks before some other customers, then goes over 
to Don, taps him on the shoulder.

               NAT
     Mr. Birnam, you ought to go home. 
     You're late.

               DON
     Yea, all which it inherit shall 
     dissolve --

Nat leans forward as tactfully as possible.

               NAT
     You ought to be home, on account of 
     your brother.

Don half turns to him.

               DON
     Who says so?

               NAT
     You said so yourself. On account of 
     you're going away somewheres.

               DON
     Huh?

               NAT
     Don't you remember?

He pushes the bag with the bottles and the apples towards 
Don. Don looks at them. Suddenly it penetrates. He is seized 
by alarm.

               DON
     What time is it?

               NAT
     Ten past six.

               DON
     Why didn't you tell me?

               NAT
     What do you think I've been doing 
     for half an hour?

Don snatches up the bag, the apples spilling out as he does 
so. He turns to go. Nat points at the few coins which is all 
that is left of Don's money.

               NAT
     Take your change.

Don scoops up the money, a few dollar bills and some silver, 
and hurries out.

A-27 THIRD AVENUE, CORNER OF 55TH STREET - (EVENING)

Don comes from Nat's bar, runs around the corner to his house.

A-28 APARTMENT HOUSE WHERE THE BIRNAMS LIVE

Don, clutching the bag with the bottles, runs into the house.

A-29 FIRST FLOOR HALL, APARTMENT HOUSE

Don dashes in and starts upstairs. After a few steps he stops. 
What if his brother is up there already? He stands undecided, 
then sneaks down the steps and walks to the rear of the 
entrance hall, where there's a glass door leading into the 
shabby garden.

A-30 GARDEN IN BACK OF APARTMENT HOUSE - (DARK)

Don comes out, walks far enough to be able to look up at the 
back of the building. Are the lights on in their apartment 
on the fourth floor? There is a light on the second floor, 
nothing on the third, and on the fourth the lights are on in 
the living room and the bedroom windows, all of which are 
open.

Don stands looking up. What shall he do? Go up and face the 
music? Run away? Weakly he walks over to the stone bench and 
sits down, putting the bottles on the bench next him. He 
takes out his handkerchief, mops his forehead. His eyes go 
up to the lighted windows again.

A-31 THE LIGHTED WINDOWS, FROM DOWN BELOW

Someone has stepped to the bedroom window. It's Helen. He 
can recognize her, silhouetted against the light of the room.

A-32 DON, SITTING ON THE BENCH

His eyes fixed on the window above. Instinctively, he draws 
back into the shadow of the sumac tree, as though Helen could 
see him through the darkness.

A-33 EXT. BEDROOM WINDOW, FROM DON'S POINT OF VIEW

Helen disappears from the window into the room.

A-34 INT. BEDROOM

Helen is moving away from the window. Wick stands before his 
suitcase, which is open and all packed save for slippers and 
bathrobe, which he is rolling together.

               HELEN
     Do you suppose he's at Morandi's, or 
     Nat's bar, or that place on Forty-
     second Street?

               WICK
     What difference does it make?

               HELEN
     You're not really going, Wick.

               WICK
     I certainly am.

He puts the robe with the slippers inside it into the case.

               HELEN
     You can't leave him alone. Not for 
     four days.

Wick slams shut the suitcase, snaps the lock.

               HELEN
     Wick, for heaven's sake, if he's 
     left alone anything can happen! I'll 
     be tied up at the office every minute, 
     All Saturday. All Sunday. I can't 
     look out for him. You know how he 
     gets. He'll be run over by a car. 
     He'll be arrested. He doesn't know 
     what he's doing. A cigarette will 
     fall out of his mouth and he'll burn 
     in his bed --

               WICK
     Oh Helen, if it happens, it happens. 
     And I hope it does. I've had six 
     years of this. I've had my bellyful.

               HELEN
     You can't mean that.

Wick takes his suitcase, goes into the living room.

               WICK
     Yes, I do. It's terrible, I know, 
     but I mean it.

Helen follows him.

A-35 LIVING ROOM

Wick comes into the living room, sets down the suitcase and 
during the ensuing scene takes a topcoat from the closet.

               HELEN
     For heaven's sake, Wick --

               WICK
     Who are we fooling? We've tried 
     everything, haven't we? We've reasoned 
     with him, we've babied him. We've 
     watched him like a hawk. We've tried 
     trusting him. How often have you 
     cried? How often have I beaten him 
     up? We scrape him out of the gutter 
     and pump some kind of self-respect 
     into him, and back he falls, back 
     in, every time.

               HELEN
     He's a sick person. It's as though 
     he had something wrong with his lungs 
     or his heart. You wouldn't walk out 
     on him because he had an attack. He 
     needs our help.

               WICK
     He won't accept our help. Not Don. 
     He hates us. He wants to be alone 
     with that bottle of his. It's the 
     only thing he gives a hang about.

Helen turns away from Wick, leans against the wall, hoping 
he won't see that she's crying.

               WICK
     Why kid ourselves? He's one of the 
     lost ones.
          (OR, ALTERNATE LINE:)
     Why kid ourselves? He's a hopeless 
     alcoholic.

Wick leans into the bedroom, snaps off the light. He picks 
up the suitcase, puts the topcoat over his arm, takes her 
very gently by the arm.

               WICK
     Come, Helen.

He leads her towards the entrance door.

A-36 DON, ON THE BENCH IN THE DARK GARDEN

He stares towards the windows.

A-37 THE WINDOWS, FROM BELOW

The bedroom window is dark. In the next second the lights in 
the living room go off.

A-38 DON, IN THE GARDEN

He picks up the bottles, rises, walks across the garden 
towards the glass door to the hall, peers through it 
cautiously.

A-39 STAIRCASE AND HALL, FIRST FLOOR OF THE APARTMENT HOUSE 
(FROM DON'S POINT OF VIEW)

Wick and Helen come down the stairs, Wick carrying the 
suitcase and topcoat. They go out the front door.

A-40 EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE

Wick and Helen have come out. Wick is hailing a taxi.

               WICK
     Taxi! Taxi!
          (To Helen)
     I'll give you a lift as far as Grand 
     Central.

               HELEN
     No thanks, Wick. I'm going to wait 
     here.

               WICK
     You're crazy.

               HELEN
     Because I won't give up? Maybe I am.

A taxi drives up.

               WICK
     Oh Helen, give yourself a chance. 
     Let go of him.

               HELEN
     Goodbye, Wick.

Wick opens the door of the taxi.

A-41 DON, AT THE GLASS DOOR TO THE GARDEN

He stands with the bag of bottles in his hand, peering through 
the entrance hall out to the street.

A-42 STREET (SHOT FROM BEHIND DON)

Wick gets in the taxi, it drives off. Helen paces up and 
down in front of the house.

Don opens the glass door, steps cautiously into the entrance 
hall.

A-43 ENTRANCE HALL

Squeezing close to the staircase wall so that Helen won't 
see him, Don gets to the staircase, then leaps up the stairs 
as though pursued.

A-44 EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE

Helen waits outside the house. A couple of kids chasing each 
other on roller skates almost run into her. She steps back 
and stands in the doorway, looking up and down the street.

A-45 STAIRS BETWEEN THE THIRD AND FOURTH FLOORS

Don is hurrying up on tiptoe, two steps at a time. Suddenly 
the door of a third-floor apartment toward the street is 
opened. Don flattens himself against the wall, not to be 
seen by Mrs. Deveridge, who is coming out with her dog, 
Sophie, to give Sophie her evening airing. Sophie gives one 
bark in the direction of Don, but Mrs. Deveridge pays no 
attention and descends the stairs. Don starts up the stairs 
again, as silently and as fast as he can.

A-46 FOURTH-FLOOR LANDING

Don gets to his door, opens it cautiously, slips inside.

A-47 INT. LITTLE ENTRANCE HALL OF BIRNAM APARTMENT

The only light is the light from outside, coming from living 
room and bedroom. Don steps inside, closes the door. He 
doesn't turn on the light but very carefully adjusts the 
chain on the door, puts his hat away.

A-48 LIVING ROOM

Dim but for the light outside. As Don enters, he slips the 
bottles from the paper bag and puts them on a table next the 
armchair. He crumples the bag and throws it in the fireplace. 
He takes one bottle, starts towards a bookcase and is about 
to hide it behind the books when he changes his mind. He 
looks around the room. His eyes fall on the ceiling. He goes 
to the table next the couch, pulls it into the middle of the 
room, brushes some magazines to the floor, takes a small 
chair, puts it on the table, climbs to the table, from the 
table to the chair. He is now directly below the ceiling 
lighting fixture, an inverted metal bowl about two and a 
half feet in diameter. Don reaches over the edge and deposits 
the bottle inside the bowl so it can't be seen from the room. 
He climbs down, readjusts the table, the chair, and puts the 
magazines back. Don picks up a glass which is over a carafe 
on the mantelpiece. He puts it next the bottle by the wing 
chair. He opens the bottle, pours a glass about three quarters 
full, puts the glass down. He loosens his tie and lets himself 
fall into the easy chair. He looks through the open window 
on the lights of New York. His eyes slowly wander to the 
glass. He smiles. It's a smile of relief, of contentment at 
being alone with his vice. There's a little pain in his smile, 
too.

A-49 THE GLASS OF WHISKEY

THE CAMERA MOVES TOWARD IT until the glass isn't visible any 
more -- just a smooth sea of alcohol, with a little light 
playing on it. THE CAMERA plunges deep into that sea.

                                   FADE OUT:

                              END OF SEQUENCE "A"

                    SEQUENCE "B"

FADE IN:

B-1 STAIRCASE AND LANDING, FOURTH FLOOR - DAY

Through the skylight streams a dazzling shaft of sunlight, 
falling square on the door to the Birnams' apartment.

On the threshold lies a copy of the New York Times, and beside 
it stands a quart of milk. Pinned to the door is a piece of 
paper from a notebook.

From inside there is the sound of the chain being detached, 
and the door opens slowly. Don emerges. He is dressed exactly 
as he was the day before -- same suit, same shirt, same tie. 
He has slept in them and they are wrinkled. He hasn't shaved. 
As he comes out and the sun hits his face, he squints in 
agony. As he carefully closes the door, his eyes fall on the 
note. He reads it.

"Don dear: I waited for you to come home. Please be careful. 
Get some sleep. Eat. And call me, call me, call me. Helen"

There's a sly expression on Don's face as he closes the door, 
leaving everything just where it is -- note, milk bottle, 
paper. Peering down, he assures himself that the coast is 
clear, slips down the stairs.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

B-2 EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE - DAY, SUNNY - LIGHT TRAFFIC

The entrance door is half open and Dave, the janitor, an 
Italian-looking man about fifty-five, is sweeping the side-
walk in front of the house. Don comes to the doorway, waits 
until Dave's back is turned, then hurries out and slips down 
the street, CAMERA WITH HIM.

Two houses down, in a semi-basement, is MRS. WERTHEIM'S HAND 
LAUNDRY. Don goes down the steps into it.

B-3 INT. MRS. WERTHEIM'S LAUNDRY

The outer room is a kind of office, with a counter and shelves 
of clean laundry in boxes and paper packages. Steam issues 
from the actual laundry at the rear.

MRS. WERTHEIM, a gray-haired, stocky woman, is sorting 
laundry. The shop's bell rings as Don comes in. His nerves 
are on edge but he manages to work up a little nonchalance.

               DON
     Guten Tag, Mrs. Wertheim. How's 
     business?

               MRS. WERTHEIM
     Business he is good, thank you. There 
     isn't a fortune in it, but you know: 
     small fish, good fish. And I keep 
     young and healthy. Why shouldn't I, 
     sitting in a Turkish bath all day 
     for free?

She has picked a package from the shelf, puts it on the 
counter.

               MRS. WERTHEIM
     Three dollars and ninety.

               DON
     I wonder if you could do me a favor, 
     gnaedige Frau?

               MRS. WERTHEIM
     Always glad, Mr. Birnam.

               DON
     My brother's gone away for the weekend 
     and he took the checkbook along...

               MRS. WERTHEIM
     Oh, you want a blank check?

               DON
     It's not that. It's just that I'm a 
     little short.

               MRS. WERTHEIM
          (Sizing up his stature)
     What do you mean, you're short?

               DON
     I wonder if you could let me have a 
     little cash, bitte schoen?

               MRS. WERTHEIM
     A little cash?

               DON
     I thought about twenty dollars, maybe. 
     Only till Monday, when my brother 
     comes back.

               MRS. WERTHEIM
     You thought... No, Mr. Birnam. I 
     cannot. Not that I don't want to, 
     because I want to, but I cannot. And 
     when I say not, I mean absolutely 
     not.

Her eyes fall on his tortured face. It's too much for her. 
She rings open the cash register.

               MRS. WERTHEIM
     I'll let you have five dollars.

               DON
     That's all right.

She hands him the five dollars.

               DON
     Danke schoen, Mrs. Wertheim.

He turns and leaves, doesn't even hear:

               MRS. WERTHEIM
     Your laundry, Mr. Birnam! How about 
     your laundry?

She looks after him but there's only the ringing of the shop 
bell as he leaves.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

B-4 NAT'S BAR - BRILLIANT SUNSHINE OUTSIDE

No one is in the bar but Nat: he is cooking some ham and 
eggs for himself on an electric plate behind the bar. The 
floor has been mopped and is still shiny. The chairs are 
piled on the tables.

Into the bar comes Don. He is walking rather slowly but it's 
a tremendous effort not to race in and yell for what he needs 
so desperately.

               NAT
     Hi.

Don goes to the bar and sits. He takes the five dollars from 
his pocket, puts it on the bar.

               NAT
     Thought you were going away for the 
     weekend.

No answer from Don. He sits holding his head in his hands. 
The bar is silent except for the sizzling noise of the eggs 
and ham. Suddenly Don pounds the bar and explodes.

               DON
     For the love of Pete, what are you 
     doing, Nat. Give me a drink!

               NAT
     Right with you, Mr. Birnam. Just 
     fixing my lunch.

               DON
     Well, stop it and come on and give 
     me a drink, for heaven's sake.
          (Banging the bar)
     Come on, come on!

               NAT
     Okay.

He stirs the food once more and takes the skillet off the 
stove, snaps off the electricity with a slowness agonizing 
to Don.

               DON
          (Quietly, though his 
               nerves are cracking)
     Can't you hurry it up a little, Nat?

Nat pours a jiggerful.

               NAT
     Here you are, Mr. Birnam.

               DON
     Thank you, Nat.

Don chokes it down and holds out the jigger for another. Nat 
pours it.

               NAT
     That young lady stopped in last night, 
     looking for you.

               DON
     What young lady?

               NAT
     The one with the leopard coat.

               DON
     Yeah?

               NAT
     She was acting like she just happened 
     to drop in, but I know she was making 
     the rounds after you.

               DON
          (Panicky)
     What did you say to her?

               NAT
     I said you hadn't been in for two 
     weeks.

               DON
     Good. I can't let her see me. Not 
     now while I'm "off" like this.

               NAT
     Then why in the name of -- Why don't 
     you cut it short?

               DON
     You're talking like a child. You 
     can't cut it short! You're on that 
     merry-go-round and you've got to 
     ride it all the way, round and round, 
     till the blasted music wears itself 
     out and the thing dies down and clunks 
     to a stop.

Nat brings over the plate of ham and eggs.

               NAT
     How about you eating this?

               DON
     Take it away.

               NAT
     You got to eat something sometime.

               DON
     Give me another drink.

               NAT
     Look, Mr. Birnam, this is still 
     morning.

He pours another drink. Don downs it.

               DON
     That's when you need it most, in the 
     morning. Haven't you learned that, 
     Nat? At night this stuff's a drink. 
     In the morning it's medicine.

               NAT
     Okay if I eat?

               DON
     Move it a little to one side.

Don taps with the jigger. Nat fills it, then sits down to 
his ham and eggs.

               DON
     Nat, are you ever scared when you 
     wake up? So scared the sweat starts 
     out of you? No, not you. With you 
     it's simple. Your alarm clock goes 
     off and you open your eyes and brush 
     your teeth and read the Daily Mirror. 
     That's all. Do you ever lie in your 
     bed looking at the window? A little 
     daylight's coming through, and you 
     start wondering: is it getting 
     lighter, is it getting darker? Is it 
     dawn or dusk? That's a terrifying 
     problem, Nat. You hold your breath 
     and you pray that it's dusk, so you 
     can go out and get yourself some 
     more liquor. Because if it's dawn, 
     you're dead. The bars are closed and 
     the liquor stores don't open till 
     nine. You can't last till nine. Or 
     it might be Sunday. That's the worst. 
     No liquor stores at all, and you 
     guys wouldn't open a bar, not until 
     one o'clock. Why? Why, Nat?

               NAT
     Because we got to go to church once 
     in a while. That's why.

               DON
     Yes, when a guy needs it most.

He drinks his jiggerful.

               NAT
     How about those two quarts? Did you 
     polish them off last night?

               DON
     What two quarts?

               NAT
     The two bottles you had.

An electric current runs through Don.

               DON
     That's right, I did have two bottles, 
     didn't I? I hid one of them. I've 
     still got it. I'm a capitalist, Nat! 
     I've got untapped reserves. I'm rich!

He taps the glass on the bar.

               NAT
          (Pouring another drink)
     Mr. Birnam, if you had enough money 
     you'd kill yourself in a month.

From the street enters Gloria, wearing a shirtwaist and skirt, 
another foolish little hat, and high-heeled shoes with bows.

               GLORIA
     Say, Nat, was there a gentleman --
          (She sees Don)
     Hello, Mr. Birnam. Didn't you go 
     away for the weekend?

               DON
     Apparently not, Gloria.

               GLORIA
          (Back to Nat)
     Was there a gentleman in here asking 
     for me?

               NAT
     Not to my knowledge there wasn't.

He is drinking his coffee.

               GLORIA
     He was supposed to come around twelve 
     o'clock. He's from Albany.

               DON
     Another friend of the folks?

               GLORIA
     More a friend of a friend of the 
     folks type. A fellow telephoned me 
     about him. Wants me to show him the 
     town.

               NAT
     Like Grant's Tomb for instance?

               GLORIA
     But def.

               NAT
     Amazing, ain't it, how many guys run 
     down from Albany just to see Grant's 
     Tomb.

               GLORIA
          (To Don)
     Sometimes I wish you came from Albany.

               DON
     Where would you take me?

               GLORIA
     Oh, lots of places. The Music Hall, 
     and then the New Yorker Roof maybe.

               DON
     There is now being presented at a 
     theatre on Forty-fourth Street the 
     uncut version of Hamlet. I see us as 
     setting out for that. Do you know 
     Hamlet?

               GLORIA
     I know Forty-fourth Street.

               DON
     I'd like to get your interpretation

Don shakes his head.

               DON
     But afterwards, dozens of bluepoints

               DON
     Of course, little Gloria.

A man has entered the bar, a round-faced, middle-aged man 
with pince-nez. There is a Guide of New York sticking from 
his pocket. He's the guy from Albany, all right.

               ALBANY
          (Rather loud)
     Could I have a glass of water?

               NAT
     Why, sure. And what shall it be for 
     a chaser?

               ALBANY

     Tell me: this is Nat's Bar, isn't 
     it?

               NAT
     That's what the man said.

               ALBANY
     I'm looking for a young lady name of 
     Gloria.

With his thumb, Nat indicates Gloria.

               ALBANY
          (Beaming)
     Are you Miss Gloria?

               GLORIA
     Who, me? No, I'm not. I just live 
     with Gloria. She's not here.

               ALBANY
     She isn't?

               GLORIA
     And she won't be. She's down to the

               ALBANY
     Aquarium?

               exploding noise)
     Scared the life out of me.

               ALBANY
     That's terrible.

               GLORIA
     Goodbye.

               ALBANY
     Goodbye.

He takes a couple of steps towards the door, turns.

               ALBANY
     Could I have a word with you?

               GLORIA
     No thanks. Thanks a lot, but no 
     thanks.

               ALBANY
     You're welcome, I'm sure.

He walks out, bewildered.

               DON
     Wasn't that rather rude, Gloria, to 
     send that nice man all alone to 
     Grant's Tomb?

     you? If you are, what time?

               DON
     What time do you suggest?

               GLORIA
     How about eight?

               DON
     Eight's fine.

               GLORIA
     I live right in the corner house. 
     You know where the antique shop is, 
     the one with the wooden Indian

               DON
     I'll be there.

     Second floor. Oh, Mr. Birnam, all 
     I've got is a semi-formal. Will that 
     be all right?

     That'll be fine.

               GLORIA
          (Happily)
     Goodbye, Not.

She starts for the door, turns.

               GLORIA
     You know, this show you're taking me 
     to. If it's too highbrow, I can just 
     lean back and look at the back of 
     your neck, can't I? Eight o'clock.

She exits.

               DON
     One last one, Nat. Pour it softly, 
     pour it gently, and pour it to the 
     brim.

               NAT
     Look, Mr. Birnam, there's a lot of 
     bars on Third Avenue. Do me a favor -- 
     get out of here and buy it someplace 
     else.

               DON
     What's the matter?

               NAT
     I don't like you much. What was the 
     idea of pulling her leg? You know 
     you're never going to take her out.

               DON
     Who says I'm not?

               NAT
     I say so. You're drunk and you're 
     just making with your mouth.

               DON
     Give me a drink, Nat.

               NAT
     And that other dame -- I mean the 
     lady. I don't like what you're doing 
     to her either.

               DON
     Shut up.

               NAT
     You should've seen her last night, 
     coming in here looking for you, with 
     her eyes all rainy and the mascara 
     all washed away.

               DON
     Give me a drink!

               NAT
     That's an awful high class young 
     lady.

               DON
     You bet she is.

               NAT
     How the heck did she ever get mixed 
     up with a guy that sops it up like 
     you do?

               DON
     It's a problem, isn't it. That nice 
     young man that drinks, and the high-
     class young lady, and how did she 
     ever get mixed up with him, and why 
     does he drink and why doesn't he 
     stop. That's my novel, Nat. I wanted 
     to start writing it out in the 
     country. Morbid stuff. Nothing for 
     the Book-of-the Month Club. A horror 
     story. The confessions of a booze 
     addict, the log book of an alcoholic.
          (Holding out the jigger)
     Come on, Nat. Break down.

Nat does break down and pours a drink.

               DON
     Do you know what I'm going to call 
     my novel? The Bottle -- that's all. 
     Very simply, The Bottle. I've got it 
     all in my mind. Let me tell you the 
     first chapter. It all starts one wet 
     afternoon about three years ago. 
     There was a matinee of La Traviata 
     at the Metropolitan --

                                             SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

B-5 EXT. METROPOLITAN OPERA HOUSE - AN AUTUMN AFTERNOON, 
HEAVY RAIN

HIGH CAMERA, SHOOTING DOWN past the glass-and-iron marquee 
towards the entrance, beside which is a billboard announcing 
Verdi's LA TRAVIATA. A crowd of people is streaming into the 
building. They are wearing raincoats, carrying umbrellas.

B-6 THE VESTIBULE AND CLOAKROOM WINDOW AT THE METROPOLITAN

It is doing a land-office business, checking dripping 
umbrellas and apparel. Among the crowd is Don Birnam. He is 
alone and wears a bowler and a straight raincoat. He takes 
off his hat and shakes the rain from it, then peels off his 
raincoat. In the side pocket of his suit is a pint of liquor. 
It bulges and the nose projects. For a second Don considers 
whether it'll pass muster, but it's a little too prominent. 
With a quick gesture he transfers the bottle to the pocket 
of the raincoat, rolls the raincoat up like swaddling clothes 
around a precious infant. Seeing an opening in the line at 
the cloak room counter, he steps into it.

There is a great confusion of hands, coats, coat checks, 
customers and overworked attendants. Don hands his coat to 
an attendant. His eyes linger on its pocket with a certain 
tenderness, then he turns and starts towards the door of the 
auditorium.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

B-7 A SECTION OF SEATS AT THE METROPOLITAN

Don sits about five seats from the aisle. He is under the 
pleasant spell of the overture of La Traviata.

B-8 DON

He sits between an elderly daughter and her age-old mother, 
and a middle-aged man and wife. He is glancing through the 
program as the curtain rises (changing the light on our 
group). Don looks up.

B-9 THE STAGE

The set is a Louis XIVth salon, in the year 1700. It's 
Violetta's supper. The guests are singing "Libiamo, libiamo," 
which is a drinking song in waltz time.

B-10 DON

He loves music and especially Italian opera, but maybe he'd 
have come late if he'd remembered the content of the first 
scene.

B-11 ON THE STAGE

Powdered footmen are pouring wine into the glasses of the 
over-vivacious guests.

B-12 DON

Thirst in his eyes, he looks away from the stage, tries to 
concentrate on the ceiling of the Metropolitan. No go. His 
eyes wander back to:

B-13 THE STAGE

Alfred and Violetta are batting the drinking song back and 
forth, as the chorus, glasses in hand, stands slowly swaying, 
echoing each couplet.

B-14 DON

That thirst is coming up again. The first drops of sweat are 
gathering on his forehead. As he looks at the stage, his 
imagination is working at top speed.

B-15 STAGE

The swaying echelon of choristers SLOWLY DISSOLVES to a row 
of raincoats, exactly like the one Don wore. They hang from 
hangers and sway slowly to Verdi's rhythm.

B-16 DON'S FACE

His eyes glued to what he sees on the stage. He takes the 
handkerchief from his pocket and wipes his forehead.

B-17 THE STAGE

The raincoats swaying slowly. THE CAMERA APPROACHES one of 
them. From the pocket projects a bottle of whiskey.

B-18 DON

He is wiping his parched mouth. He puts the handkerchief 
back. He fishes the coat check from his pocket, buries it in 
his fist, fighting the foolish impulse. It's a short struggle, 
which he loses. He rises and, to the irritation of his 
neighbors, leaves his seat amid some disapproving shushings 
from the row behind.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

B-19 CLOAK ROOM AND VESTIBULE

It is completely empty save for the elderly attendant, who 
is dozing over his paper. From inside comes Verdi's music 
and Don Birnam. He puts the check on the counter. The 
attendant looks up from a newspaper.

               ATTENDANT
     Did you forget something?

               DON
     No. Going home, if it's all right 
     with you.

The attendant takes the check and leaves. Don rolls his 
program and sticks it into the sand of the cuspidor. He is 
filled with a nervous anticipation of the drink which is on 
its way. The attendant returns.

               ATTENDANT
     Say, this isn't yours.

Don looks. The attendant holds a short leopard coat and a 
lady's small umbrella.

               DON
     No, it certainly isn't.

               ATTENDANT
          (Comparing the check 
               with the number on 
               the hanger)
     That's what it says though -- 417.

               DON
     I don't care what it says.

               ATTENDANT
     The checks must have got mixed up.

               DON
     Maybe they did. Find me my coat. 
     It's a plain man's raincoat and a 
     derby.

               ATTENDANT
     Are you kidding? Do you know how 
     many plain men's raincoats we have 
     on a day like this? About a thousand.

               DON
     Let me get back there. I can find 
     it.

               ATTENDANT
     That's against regulations, sir.

               DON
     I'm not going to wait till the end 
     of the performance.

               ATTENDANT
     You can get your coat tomorrow.

Don's nervousness is mounting. He is searching his pockets.

               DON
     Look, man, there's something in the 
     pocket of that coat I -- It so happens 
     I find myself without any money and 
     I need that coat. And I need it now.

               ATTENDANT
     Listen, if everybody went in there 
     digging through those coats... There's 
     regulations. There's got to be 
     regulations.

               DON
     What do you suggest?

               ATTENDANT
     You just wait till the other party 
     comes and then you can swap.

               DON
     I want my coat.

               ATTENDANT
     As far as I'm concerned, that's your 
     coat.

He shoves the leopard coat and umbrella close to Don.

               DON
     You're a great help.

He is biting his lips, unable to find another argument. The 
attendant has returned to the other end of the counter and 
resumed his doze. Don gets out a cigarette. Without opening 
his eyes, the attendant calls it.

               ATTENDANT
     No smoking.

               DON
          (Sourly)
     I thought so.

He puts the cigarette away, leans back on the counter, arms 
folded.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

B-20 VESITBULE, NEAR CLOAK ROOM

Empty, save for Don, who paces up and down nervously, carrying 
the leopard coat and the umbrella. He glances over the coat 
a little, at the initials inside, at the label. Over the 
scene comes a muted aria from the second act.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

B-21 A STAIRCASE LEADING TO THE GALLERY

Empty, save for Don, who sits on a step, the coat next him. 
With the umbrella he is nervously tracing the pattern in the 
carpet. Inside, the music rises to a finale and the first 
people start streaming down from the gallery. Don grabs up 
the coat and hurries towards the cloak room.

B-22 VESTIBULE AND CLOAK ROOM

People are streaming up from all sides to get their 
belongings. Don comes into the shot and, standing on his 
toes, tries to locate the claimant of his coat and hat.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

B-23 VESTIBULE AND CLOAK ROOM

It is almost empty. Don still stands with the coat, looking. 
As the last few people leave, at the far end of the counter 
he sees Helen, in a little leopard hat, his coat over her 
arm, his derby in her hand. She sees him with her coat and 
her umbrella and the two approach slowly.

               DON
          (Trying to control 
               his irritation)
     That's my coat you've got.

               HELEN
     And that's mine, thank heaven. They 
     mixed up the checks.

               DON
     They certainly did. I thought you'd 
     never come.

He takes his coat rather brusquely, thrusts the leopard coat 
at her.

               HELEN
     You can't have been waiting so long.

               DON
     Only since the first aria of the 
     first act. That's all.

               HELEN
     Do you always just drop in for the 
     overture?

Don takes the coat, feels it hurriedly to make sure the bottle 
is still there, and starts away.

               DON
     Goodbye.

Helen is left with the leopard coat and his bowler.

               HELEN
          (Waving the hat toward 
               Don)
     Hey, wait a minute!

Don comes back, takes the hat, starts away again.

               HELEN
     My umbrella, if you don't mind.

His patience exhausted, Don stops again, takes the umbrella 
and tosses it in Helen's direction. Helen, who is getting 
into her coat, can't catch it. It falls right next to her.

               HELEN
     Thank you very much.

Don stands abashed. He goes back, picks up the umbrella.

               DON
     I'm terribly sorry.

               HELEN
     You're the rudest person I ever saw. 
     What's the matter with you?

               DON
     Just rude, I guess.

               HELEN
     Really, somebody should talk to your 
     mother.

               DON
     They tried, Miss St. John.

               HELEN
     My name's not St. John.

               DON
     St. Joseph, then.

               HELEN
     St. James.

               DON
     First name Hilda or Helen, or Harriet 
     maybe?

               HELEN
     Helen.

               DON
     You come from Toledo, Ohio.

               HELEN
     How do you know?

               DON
     I've had three long acts to work you 
     out from that coat of yours. Initials, 
     label -- Alfred Spitzer, Fine Furs, 
     Toledo, Ohio.

               HELEN
     Maybe I should have explored your 
     coat.

               DON
     But you didn't.

               HELEN
     Didn't have time.

               DON
     Good. My name is Don Birnam.

As they go on talking, they walk from the cloak room, through 
the vestibule, to the street, Don carrying his coat over his 
arm.

               DON
     How do you like New York?

               HELEN
     Love it.

               DON
     How long are you going to stay?

               HELEN
     Oh, sixty years, perhaps.

Don doesn't get it.

               HELEN
     I live here now. I've got a job.

               DON
     Doing what?

               HELEN
     I'm on Time Magazine.

               DON
     Time Magazine? In that case perhaps 
     you could do something for me.

               HELEN
     Yes.

               DON
     Could you help me to become Man of 
     the Year?

               HELEN
     Delighted. What do you do?

               DON
     Yes, what do I do? I'm a writer. 
     I've just started a novel. I've 
     started quite a few novels. I never 
     seem to finish one.

               HELEN
     In that case, why not write short 
     stories.

               DON
     I have some of those. The first 
     paragraph. Then there's one-half of 
     the opening scene of a play. It all 
     takes place in the leaning tower of 
     Pisa and explains why it leans. And 
     why all sensible buildings should 
     lean.

               HELEN
     They'll love that in Toledo.

               DON
     Are you by any chance coming here to 
     Lohengrin next week?

               HELEN
     I don't know.

               DON
     Because if you are, I'm not going to 
     let this coat out of my hands.

               HELEN
     Don't worry.

               DON
     I do, though. To be really safe, 
     maybe we should go together.

               HELEN
     We could.

               DON
     Are you in the telephone book?

               HELEN
     Yes, but I'm not home very much.

               DON
     Then I'll call you at the office.

               HELEN
     Editorial Research. If Henry Luce 
     answers the phone, hang up.

They have reached the curb outside the Metropolitan. It is 
dark and the rain has settled to a drizzle.

               DON
     Taxi?

               HELEN
     No, thank you. I'm taking the subway.

               DON
     Very sensible.

               HELEN
     As a matter of fact, I'm going to an 
     extremely crazy party on Washington 
     Square. If you want, I'll take you 
     along.

There is a split second of indecision but it is ended by 
Don's awareness of the bottle in his raincoat.

               DON
     Thank you very much, Miss St. James, 
     but I have to see a friend uptown.

               HELEN
     Goodbye, Mr. Birnam.

               DON
     Goodbye.

He is unfurling his raincoat in order to put it on before he 
steps from under the marquee. Helen is about a step and a 
half away when there is a crash. She stops and looks down, 
as does Don. On the sidewalk lies the pint of whiskey, broken.

               HELEN
     Who threw that?

               DON
          (Casually)
     It fell out of my pocket.

               HELEN
     Do you always carry those things?

               DON
     You see... that friend, the one 
     uptown, he has a cold. I thought I'd 
     take this along and make him a hot 
     toddy.

               HELEN
     Now he gets hot lemonade and some 
     aspirin.

               DON
     I shall.

               HELEN
     Goodbye.

She goes. Don looks at the broken bottle, then after Helen. 
With sudden decision he calls after her.

               DON
     Miss St. James!

               HELEN
          (Turning)
     Yes?

               DON
     What kind of a party was that you 
     asked me to?

               HELEN
     A cocktail party.

               DON
     Invitation still stand?

               HELEN
     Of course. Come on.

He joins her, takes the umbrella out of her hand and holds 
it over them both as they go down the street.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

B-24 NAT'S BAR

As we have left it, empty save for Nat and Don. Sunlight 
outside. Nat is now taking the chairs from the tables and 
arranging the bar for the afternoon and evening trade, while 
Don leans back against the bar, the jigger of whiskey in his 
hand, and goes on talking.

               DON
     How's that for a first meeting, Nat? 
     Cute, full of laughs. A charming 
     girl, an extra special girl. Her 
     coat-check might just as well have 
     been mixed up with the coat-check of 
     a solid citizen, the son of the 
     chairman of some insurance company, 
     highly eligible, no vices except 
     that sometimes he plays the cello. 
     But oh no, that would have made 
     everything too simple. It had to be 
     that young man with the bottle.

               NAT
     Listen, once that bottle smashes, 
     doesn't she catch on?

               DON
     No, she doesn't.

               NAT
     Okay. So they go to that cocktail 
     party and he gets stinko and falls 
     flat on his face.

               DON
     He doesn't. He's crazy about that 
     girl by then. He drinks tomato juice. 
     Doesn't touch liquor for that whole 
     week -- for two weeks, for six weeks.

               NAT
     He's in love, huh?

               DON
     That's what's going to be hard to 
     write. Love's the hardest thing in 
     the world to write about. So simple. 
     You've got to catch it through 
     details, like the early morning 
     sunlight hitting the gray tin of the 
     ashcans in front of her house. A 
     ringing telephone that sounds like 
     Beethoven's Pastoral. A letter 
     scribbled on her office stationery 
     that you carry in your pocket because 
     it smells of all the lilacs in Ohio.

               NAT
     And no drinking?

               DON
     He thinks he's cured. If he can get 
     a job now, they can be married and 
     that's that. Only it's not, Nat. Not 
     quite. Because one day, one terrible 
     day --
          (He taps the jigger)
     Pour it, Nat.

Nat does.

               NAT
     Yeah?

Don drinks.

               NAT
     Well, go on.

               DON
     You see, that girl's been writing to 
     her family in Toledo They want to 
     meet this young man. So they come to 
     New York. They stay at the Hotel 
     Manhattan. Their very first day, 
     she's to introduce him to her parents. 
     One o'clock. Lobby of the hotel...

                                             SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

B-25 INT. LOBBY OF THE MANHATTAN HOTEL - (MIDDAY)

It is filled with the routine activity of a big commercial 
hotel on a hot summer day.

Don Birnam, in a light summer suit, paces up and down the 
lobby. Under his arm is a florist's box. He keeps eyeing the 
doors to the elevators. He walks toward one of those circular 
plush settees common to hotels, sits down, puts the flower 
box next to him and adjusts the knot of his tie, his eye 
still on the elevator doors.

On the other side of the settee are a middle-aged couple. 
Don can't see them, they can't see him, as he overhears their 
conversation, and it takes him a little time to realize that 
they are Helen's parents.

MR. ST. JAMES is wearing a linen suit and a good but yellowing 
panama hat, the brim turned up. MRS. ST. JAMES is a cheerful 
little woman with glasses pinned to her dress, the kind that 
pull. Mr. St. James is fuming a little.

               MR. ST. JAMES
     Just walked in for a simple haircut. 
     No, that wasn't enough, not for New 
     York. They gave me a shampoo, a scalp 
     massage, a manicure. Thought they'd 
     tear my shoes off and paint my 
     toenails.

Mrs. St. James laughs comfortably.

               MRS. ST. JAMES
     I had a lovely morning. Just did a 
     little window shopping. I didn't 
     want to get all tired out.

               MR. ST. JAMES
     On account of meeting that young 
     man? Now, Mother.

               MRS. ST. JAMES
     Who did you get a haircut for?

               MR. ST. JAMES
     Wonder what's keeping Helen.

               MRS. ST. JAMES
     She'll be here.

               MR. ST. JAMES
     This Birnam fellow went to Cornell, 
     didn't he?

               MRS. ST. JAMES
     I believe so, but Helen says he never 
     graduated.

               MR. ST. JAMES
     I wonder why. How old is he?

               MRS. ST. JAMES
     Thirty-three.

               MR. ST. JAMES
     He has no job. As far as I can find 
     out, he never had one. I wish Helen 
     wasn't so vague.

By now Don knows only too well that he is the subject of 
their discussion. He leans his head against the back of the 
settee, acutely uncomfortable.

               MRS. ST. JAMES
     Maybe he has a little money. Some 
     people do, you know, Father.

               MR. ST. JAMES
     He ought to have a job anyway.

               MRS. ST. JAMES
     He's a writer.

               MR. ST. JAMES
     A writer? What does he write? I never 
     heard of his name.

               MRS. ST. JAMES
     Now Father, relax. You always expect 
     the worst. I've made up my mind he's 
     a well-brought-up young man who wipes 
     his feet before he enters a house 
     and doesn't even smoke.

               MR. ST. JAMES
     I hope he realizes Helen's our only 
     daughter and we ought to know a few 
     things about him.

               MRS. ST. JAMES
     Those'll all come out -- his 
     background, his prospects, his church 
     affiliations.

Don can't take any more of this. He picks up the florist's 
box, rises and moves away from the settee. When he has reached 
the security of some potted palms, he looks back. Through 
one of the revolving doors comes Helen, in a new spring suit. 
She looks around, sees her parents, goes up to them. There 
is a greeting, some conversation apparently about Don and 
the fact that he'll get there any minute. She sits on the 
settee between her parents, all three of them waiting for 
Don.

Don stands undecided, then looks around, locates the public 
telephone booths, steps into one of them.

B-26 INT. TELEPHONE BOOTH

Don deposits a nickel and dials the number of the Hotel 
Manhattan, which is above the mouthpiece of the phone.

               DON
     Manhattan Hotel?... Will you page 
     Miss St. James? She must be in the 
     lobby.

He holds the phone and looks through the glass door of the 
telephone booth.

B-27 LOBBY, FROM DON'S POINT OF VIEW - (SILENT, AS IT IS 
SHOT THROUGH THE GLASS OF THE PHONE BOOTH)

A bell-hop crosses the lobby, paging Miss St. James. Helen 
rises and follows him over to the line of house phones on a 
shelf. She picks up the phone, speaks.

B-28 DON, AT THE PHONE

               DON
     Helen?... Don. I'm terribly sorry 
     but I can't get there for a while. 
     Please go ahead with your lunch and 
     apologize to your parents... No, 
     nothing serious. I'll be there. 
     Goodbye.

B-29 LOBBY, FROM DON'S ANGLE, THROUGH THE GLASS OF THE PHONE 
BOOTH

Helen has hung up too. She goes towards her parents, her 
face a little crestfallen. As she joins them she evidently 
starts to explain.

B-30 EXT. TELEPHONE BOOTH

Don emerges with the florist's box, careful not to be seen. 
He leaves through one of the side doors.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

B-31 LIVING ROOM, BIRNAM BROTHERS' APARTMENT - TWILIGHT

SHOOTING TOWARDS hall and entrance door. In the dim fore-
ground stands a small table, beyond it the vague contours of 
Don lying on the couch. On the floor beside him an empty 
bottle, in his hand a half-filled glass. There are footsteps 
from the stairs. A key is turned in the lock, and Wick enters. 
He wears a hat and carries a brief-case. He switches on the 
light in the little entrance hall, flips his hat jauntily to 
a hook on the coat-rack and comes into the living room. As 
he crosses the threshold he becomes aware of Don's presence.

               WICK
     Don?

He snaps on the light, sees Don on the couch, drunk. Don 
doesn't move an inch, only his eyes close.

               DON
     Turn off that light.

               WICK
     For heaven's sake, Don.

               DON
     Turn it off!

Wick snaps off the light. From now on the scene plays in 
dimness, save for the shaft of light from the entrance hall. 
Wick throws the briefcase into a chair.

               WICK
     I thought you were with Helen and 
     her father and mother.

No answer.

               WICK
     What happened?

Still no answer. Wick goes and sits beside Don, takes the 
glass from his hand.

               WICK
          (Gently)
     Come on, Don.

               DON
     I couldn't face it.

               WICK
     You couldn't face what? Didn't you 
     go to see them?

               DON
     Certainly I went. One o'clock sharp. 
     And I saw them, all right. Only they 
     didn't see me.

               WICK
     How was that?

               DON
     Such nice, respectable people. I 
     couldn't face them, Wick, and all 
     the questions they'd ask me. I 
     couldn't face them. Not cold. I had 
     to have a drink first. Just one. 
     Only the one didn't do anything to 
     me.

               WICK
     So you had another and another. You 
     poor idiot, Don. Won't you ever learn 
     with you it's like stepping off a 
     roof and expecting to fall just one 
     floor?

Don puts his arm over his face.

               DON
     You're right, you're right. There's 
     nothing I can say.

There is a long second of silence, Wick looking at Don.

               DON
     Go ahead. Bawl me out, Wick, let me 
     have it. Why don't you take that 
     bottle and smash it over my face.

There is another pause. Wick speaks very quietly.

               WICK
     It's a quarter of eight. I suppose 
     they're still in that hotel, waiting 
     for you.

               DON
     Call her up, Wick, will you? Tell 
     her something. Tell her I'm sick. 
     Tell her I'm dead.

Wick has bent over Don and loosened his tie.

               DON
     Will you call her?

               WICK
     Yes, I'll call her.

               DON
     She must have written them a lot of 
     nice things about me. What a gentleman 
     I am. A prince.

               WICK
     Which hotel is it?

               DON
     The Manhattan. Mr. and Mrs. Charles 
     St. James from Toledo, Ohio.

Paying no attention to the sound of steps which has been 
coming from the staircase, Wick rises, puts the glass of 
whiskey on the table and is about to cross towards the 
telephone when the doorbell rings -- short, short, long, 
short. Wick freezes. Don sits up on the couch. They know 
that ring. There is a helpless look in Don's eyes.

               WICK
          (Whispering)
     Get up, Don.

Don, clinging to Wick's arm, pulls himself up. Wick pushes 
him through the doorway to the dark bedroom, closing the 
door after him. The bell rings again, that same ring.

               WICK
     Just a minute, Helen.

He snaps on the lights in the living room, rolls the empty 
bottle under the couch, takes the glass of whiskey, puts it 
behind the pile of records. As he is starting towards the 
door, the bottle rolls from under the couch. Wick stops and 
rolls it back again, then goes into the hall and opens the 
door. Helen, in a great hurry, stands outside, nervous.

               HELEN
     Hello, Wick. Is Don here?

               WICK
     Don? No.

Helen comes into the living room.

               HELEN
     Any idea where he could be?

               WICK
     Wasn't he meeting you?

B-32 DON, IN THE DARK BEDROOM

He stands leaning against the wall, breathing heavily. His 
eyes gleam with anxiety. Coming from the living room, stabbing 
him deep, is:

               HELEN'S VOICE
     He was supposed to meet us for lunch, 
     then he telephoned he'd be late. 
     Mother's beginning to think I just 
     made him up.

B-33 LIVING ROOM

               HELEN
     Do you suppose something's happened 
     to him?

               WICK
     Nonsense.

               HELEN
     But surely he'd have called back if 
     he were all right.

               WICK
     Where did he call you from?

               HELEN
     I don't know.

               WICK
     I think I've got an idea. He called 
     from out of town.

               HELEN
     Out of town? Where?

               WICK
     Philadelphia.

               HELEN
     What's he doing in Philadelphia?

               WICK
     There's an opening on the Philadelphia 
     Inquirer, The Book Section. Don wrote 
     them. He wired. I think this morning 
     early he just took a train.

               HELEN
     He never told me a word about it.

               WICK
     I'm not supposed to tell you either. 
     He wanted it to be a surprise.

               HELEN
     He did!

B-34 DON, IN THE DARK BEDROOM

He suffers like a dog as he hears what's being said in the 
living room.

               WICK'S VOICE
     He probably couldn't get to the right 
     people right away, missed a train. 
     You know how it is.

               HELEN'S VOICE
     Oh, it would be just wonderful if he 
     got the job and started working. Or 
     would it, Wick, with him in 
     Philadelphia and me in New York?

B-35 LIVING ROOM - WICK AND HELEN

               HELEN
     Don't ever tell him I said that 
     though, will you?

               WICK
     Of course not.

Suddenly his eyes are transfixed. From under the couch has 
rolled the bottle. As Helen speaks, he tries to get near it 
without her noticing.

               HELEN
     I could never understand why somebody 
     like Don, a person with so much 
     talent, such flashes of real 
     brilliance... Maybe I'm a little 
     prejudiced.

Suddenly she sees Wick trying to kick the bottle back under 
the couch.

               HELEN
     What are you doing, Wick?

               WICK
     Nothing, Helen.

               HELEN
     Where'd that bottle come from?

               WICK
     It just rolled out.

               HELEN
     From under the couch?

               WICK
     Yes, Helen.
          (With an attempt at 
               casualness)
     It's my guess that Don caught an 
     early train.

               HELEN
          (A wild guess)
     Is that Don's bottle?

               WICK
     What makes you think that?

               HELEN
     There was a bottle the first time we 
     met.

               WICK
     There was?

               HELEN
     It fell out of Don's pocket.

               WICK
     It was for me, Helen.

B-36 DON, IN THE DARK BEDROOM

He stands with his head against the door post, listening, 
harassed.

               WICK'S VOICE
     This one is mine, too. You might as 
     well hear the family scandal. I drink.

B-37 WICK AND HELEN IN THE LIVING ROOM

               WICK
     Don thinks I drink too much.

He walks over to the records and picks up the glass.

               WICK
     I had to promise I'd go on the wagon. 
     That's why I hid the bottle, so he 
     wouldn't see it.

He takes a drink.

               HELEN
     I'm so sorry, Wick. I shouldn't have 
     started asking questions. It was 
     none of my business.

               WICK
     Forget it.

B-38 DON, IN THE DARK BEDROOM

His brother's gesture has shaken him.

               HELEN'S VOICE
     I'd better be getting back to the 
     hotel. Don may be there already. And 
     don't worry, Wick, I won't mention 
     this to him.

               WICK'S VOICE
     Thank you, Helen.

               HELEN'S VOICE
     Goodbye, Wick.

               WICK'S VOICE
     Goodbye.

She must be on her way to the front door. With sudden decision 
Don opens the door to the living room and walks slowly out.

               DON
     Helen!

B-39 LIVING ROOM & ENTRANCE HALL

Almost at the door to the entrance hall, Helen turns back. 
Wick stands, the glass of whiskey in his hand, startled taut 
at the sight of Don who comes in, not too steady on his feet.

               DON
     I'm sorry, Helen. I can't let you 
     go. Not like that.

               HELEN
     Don!

               WICK
     Shut your mouth, Don.
          (To Helen)
     I'll take you downstairs.

               DON
     Thank you very much for your 
     Philadelphia story, Wick. Nice try.

Helen comes back into the room, staring at Don. She is 
beginning to realize that he's drunk. Don looks at the glass 
in Wick's hand.

               DON
     That looks so silly on you.

He takes the glass out of Wick's hand.

               WICK
          (To Helen)
     Don't listen to him.

               DON
     You don't have to. Just look at the 
     two of us.

               HELEN
     Yes. What's all this covering up?

               WICK
     All that happened is that Don was 
     nervous at the idea of meeting your 
     parents and so he took a couple of 
     drinks.

               DON
     Come on, Wick, she'd have found out 
     sooner or later.

               HELEN
     Stop it, both of you. Don's a little 
     tight. Most people drink a little. A 
     lot of them get tight once in a while.

               DON
     Sure. The lucky ones who can take it 
     or leave it. But then there are the 
     ones who can't take it, but can't 
     leave it either. What I'm trying to 
     say is I'm not a drinker. I'm a drunk. 
     They had to put me away once.

               WICK
     He went to a cure.

               DON
     Which didn't take. That first day we 
     met, you see, the dirty trick was I 
     should have had the decency to get 
     drunk, just for your sake.

               HELEN
     For my sake? We're talking about 
     you.
          (Turning to Wick)
     Is it really that bad, Wick?

               DON
     Yes, it is.

               WICK
     Can't we go over this tomorrow, Don 
     when you're feeling more like 
     yourself?

               DON
     Helen's heard the facts. That's all 
     there is to it.

               HELEN
     I've heard them and they're not very 
     pleasant. But they could be worse. 
     After all, you're not an embezzler 
     or a murderer. You drink too much. 
     That's not fatal. One cure didn't 
     take. There are others.

               WICK
     Of course there are.

               DON
     This has a familiar ring.

               HELEN
     There must be a reason why you drink. 
     The right doctor can find it.

               DON
     I'm way ahead of the right doctor. I 
     know the reason. The reason is me. 
     What I am. Or, rather, what I'm not.

               HELEN
     What aren't you that you want to be, 
     Don?

               DON
     A writer. Silly, isn't it? You see, 
     in college I passed for a genius. 
     They couldn't get out the college 
     magazine without one of my stories. 
     Boy, was I hot. Hemingway stuff. I 
     reached my peak when I was nineteen. 
     Sold a piece to the Atlantic Monthly. 
     It was reprinted in the Readers' 
     Digest. Who wants to stay in college 
     when he's Hemingway? My mother bought 
     me a brand new typewriter, and I 
     moved right in on New York. Well, 
     the first thing I wrote, that didn't 
     quite come off. And the second I 
     dropped. The public wasn't ready for 
     that one. I started a third, a fourth, 
     only about then somebody began to 
     look over my shoulder and whisper, 
     in a thin, clear voice like the E-
     string on a violin. Don Birnam, he'd 
     whisper, it's not good enough. Not 
     that way. How about a couple of drinks 
     just to put it on its feet? So I had 
     a couple. Oh, that was a great idea. 
     That made all the difference. Suddenly 
     I could see the whole thing -- the 
     tragic sweep of the great novel, 
     beautifully proportioned. But before 
     I could really grab it and throw it 
     down on paper, the drink would wear 
     off and everything be gone like a 
     mirage. Then there was despair, and 
     a drink to counterbalance despair, 
     and one to counterbalance the 
     counterbalance. I'd be sitting in 
     front of that typewriter, trying to 
     squeeze out a page that was halfway 
     decent, and that guy would pop up 
     again.

               HELEN
     What guy? Who are you talking about?

               DON
     The other Don Birnam. There are two 
     of us, you know: Don the drunk and 
     Don the writer. And the drunk will 
     say to the writer, Come on, you idiot. 
     Let's get some good out of that 
     portable. Let's hock it. We'll take 
     it to that pawn shop over on Third 
     Avenue. Always good for ten dollars, 
     for another drink, another binge, 
     another bender, another spree. Such 
     humorous words. I tried to break 
     away from that guy a lot of ways. No 
     good. Once I even bought myself a 
     gun and some bullets.
          (He goes to the desk)
     I meant to do it on my thirtieth 
     birthday.

He opens the drawer, takes out two bullets, holds them in 
the palm of his hand.

               DON
     Here are the bullets. The gun went 
     for three quarts of whiskey. That 
     other Don wanted us to have a drink 
     first. He always wants us to have a 
     drink first. The flop suicide of a 
     flop writer.

               WICK
     All right, maybe you're not a writer. 
     Why don't you do something else?

               DON
     Yes, take a nice job. Public 
     accountant, real estate salesman. I 
     haven't the guts, Helen. Most men 
     lead lives of quiet desperation. I 
     can't take quiet desperation.

               HELEN
     But you are a writer. You have every 
     quality for it. Imagination, wit, 
     pity --

               DON
     Come on, let's face reality. I'm 
     thirty-three and I'm living on the 
     charity of my brother. Room and board 
     free, and fifty cents a week for 
     cigarettes. An occasional ticket for 
     a concert or a show, out of the 
     bigness of his heart. And it is a 
     big heart, a patient heart.

               WICK
     Now, Don, I'm just carrying you along 
     for the time being.

               DON
     Shut up, Wick. I've never done 
     anything, I'm not doing anything, I 
     never will do anything. Zero, zero, 
     zero.

               HELEN
     Now you shut up. We'll straighten it 
     out.

               DON
     Look. Wick has the misfortune to be 
     my brother. You just walked in on 
     this, and if you know what's good 
     for you, you'll turn around and walk 
     out again. Walk fast and don't turn 
     back.

Helen looks at him for a second, then takes off her hat and 
throws it into a nearby chair.

               HELEN
          (To Wick)
     Why don't you make some coffee, Wick? 
     Strong. Three cups.

Wick goes into the kitchenette.

               DON
     Do yourself a favor, Helen. Go on, 
     clear out.

               HELEN
     Because I've got a rival? Because 
     you're in love with this?
          (She points at the 
               bottle)
     You don't know me, Don. I'm going to 
     fight and fight and fight. Bend down.

He doesn't bend. She raises herself to her tiptoes and kisses 
him warmly.

                                             DISSOLVE BACK TO:

B-40 NAT'S BAR - LATER IN THE DAY

Nat and Don alone. Nat is behind the bar, putting tooth-picks 
into olives which he takes from a bowl and arranges in a row 
on a plate. Don, about ten wet rings in front of him and 
what's left of Mrs. Wertheim's five dollars, is playing with 
a full jigger of rye.

               DON
     That was three years ago, Nat. That's 
     a long time to keep fighting, to 
     keep believing. They'd try a health 
     farm, a psychiatrist, a sanatorium 
     in New Jersey, No go. She'd be 
     patient. She'd be gay. She'd encourage 
     him. She'd buy a new ribbon for his 
     typewriter -- a two-color job, black 
     and red. Just write, Don. Keep 
     writing. That first paragraph came 
     off so well... There was no second 
     paragraph. There were drinks. Drinks 
     sneaked in secret. In the bathroom, 
     here, in Harlem. Promises again, 
     lies again. But she holds on. She 
     knows she's clutching a razor blade 
     but she won't let go. Three years of 
     it.

               NAT
     And what? How does it come out?

               DON
     I don't know. Haven't figured that 
     far.

               NAT
     Want me to tell you? One day your 
     guy gets wise to himself and gets 
     back that gun. Or, if he's only got 
     a dollar ten, he goes up to the Empire 
     State Building, way up on top, and 
     then --
          (he snaps his fingers)
     Or he can do it for a nickel, in a 
     subway under a train.

               DON
     Think so, Nat? What if Helen is right, 
     after all, and he sits down and turns 
     out something good -- but good -- 
     and that pulls him up and snaps him 
     out of it?

               NAT
     This guy? Not from where I sit.

Don jumps up.

               DON
     Shut up, Nat. I'm going to do it. 
     I'm going to do it now. It's all 
     there. You heard it.

               NAT
     Yes, Mr. Birnam.

               DON
     That's why I didn't go on that 
     weekend, see, so I can be alone up 
     there and sit down at my typewriter. 
     This time I'm going to do it, Nat. 
     I'm going to do it.

               NAT
     By gosh, maybe you will.

               DON
     Thank you, Nat.
          (he's up on his feet)
     Am I all paid up?

               NAT
     Yes, Mr. Birnam.

               DON
     Goodbye, Nat. I'm going home. This 
     time I've got it. I'm going to write.

               NAT
     Good luck, Mr. Birnam.

                                   DISSOLVE:

B-41 INT. BIRNAM APARTMENT - (DAY)

Don enters, the fire of real purpose in his eye. He hangs 
his hat on the hatrack, goes to the bedroom, picks up the 
typewriter, grabs the sheaf of typewriter paper Wick has 
laid on top of his suitcase and carries them into the living 
room. He puts the typewriter on the desk. Sitting down, he 
inserts a sheet of paper in the roller and begins to type:

                                        THE BOTTLE
                         A Novel by Don Birnam

He pauses, then types underneath:

                    For Helen - With All My Love

He rolls the sheet of paper up, studies what he has typed as 
though it were a painting. Then he begins to try and formulate 
that first sentence of his book. To do so is absolute agony 
for him. He gets up, puts a cigarette in his mouth, takes a 
match from a folder, lights the cigarette, throws the folder 
on the small table next to the big chair. As he does so his 
eyes fall on the empty bottle and glass. He looks at them 
for a minute, then goes over to the bookcase, puts his arm 
in back of the books and runs his hand along the rear of the 
shelf, looking for that bottle. It's not there.

He runs into the bedroom, hurries to his bed, where his 
suitcase lies packed but not closed. He wipes the suitcase 
from the bed, the contents spilling over the floor. He pulls 
up one end of the mattress, looks under it. Nothing.

He goes back into the living room, pulls the couch from the 
wall and, lying on his stomach, probes among the springs. 
Nothing there. He lies on the couch, breathing heavily.

               DON
     You had another bottle, you know you 
     did. Where did you put it? You're 
     not crazy. Where did you put it?

He jumps up, runs back to the bookcase, starts pulling out 
books, row by row. He goes to the closet, opens it wide, 
pulls out all its contents, throwing them on the floor. 
Nothing there.

He goes back to the big chair, throws himself down, exhausted. 
His eyes fall again on the empty bottle and the empty glass. 
Behind the glass lies the folder of matches. Something is 
written on it but it is distorted by the glass. However, it 
attracts Don's attention enough to make him push the glass 
to one side. The folder reads:

               HARRY'S & JOE'S
                         Where Good Liquor Flows 13 W. 52nd St.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

B-42 INT. HARRY'S & JOE'S ON 52ND ST

You know how those places look: the lower floor of a 
brownstone house, narrow, intimate, smoky. One side is a 
bar. Along the other wall there is a long, built-in bench 
with individual tables in front of it. At a miniature piano 
a guy is playing and singing "It Was So Beautiful."

Don Birnam sits on the bench at one of the small tables. In 
front of him is an empty cocktail glass. It is about his 
fourth. At the next table on the bench sits a couple -- a 
show girl type, about twenty-four, and a man about thirty-
five. They are nuts about each other and are holding hands 
as they listen to the hoarse pianist. However, to Don the 
music means little. He is very much the man of the world, 
holding his alcohol superbly, smoking a cigarette. He snaps 
his finger at a waiter, who is passing with a tray of drinks. 
The waiter stops.

               DON
     Where is my check.

               WAITER
     Right here, sir.

The waiter takes the check which is thrust between his vest 
and his stiff shirt and puts it face down in front of Don, 
then hurries on with the tray of drinks. Don turns the check 
over. It's for four dollars. Suddenly his financial situation 
dawns on Don. He puts his hand in his pocket and pulls out 
what cash he has. He does it very cautiously, under the table, 
so that no one else can see it. He hasn't enough -- only two 
one-dollar bills and some small change. Panic seizes him. At 
that moment the waiter returns, expecting to be paid.

               WAITER
     Yes, sir.

               DON
          (A little stiffly)
     One more gin vermouth.

               WAITER
     Yes, sir.

Taking the check, the waiter leaves. Don has gained a little 
time, but what shall he do with it? He considers the 
situation. The door is some thirty feet away, and the check-
room girl stands in front of it. Don looks around. Nobody in 
the bar he knows. Next him the couple is cooing away like 
Spring, -- but on the bench between him and the girl lies 
her bag. It's a handsome leather bag with gold initials, M. 
M. It's about a foot and a half away from him, but it seems 
like a mile and a half to Don. There must be some money in 
that bag. Don looks around the room, his plan forming. No 
one is looking at him. As though inadvertently, he drops his 
hand on the bench beside the bag.

The man is whispering something into the girl's ear. She is 
shaking her head. Don pulls the purse imperceptibly closer 
to himself. Guests and waiters are passing by. Very calmly 
Don smokes his cigarette, a great gentleman. The bag moves 
very close to his coat. Now, switching his cigarette, Don 
crosses his other arm so he can pull the bag up under his 
coat. He pulls it to his armpit and holds it there, tucked 
close to his ribs. Nothing in his face betrays him.

The lovers are still at it. The waiter comes back with the 
drink.

               DON
          (The young Duke)
     Thank you. Where is your wash room?

               WAITER
     Over there, sir.

He points to a door at the other end of the room. On its 
panel is the stylized profile of a gentleman with a top hat.

Don starts to rise. The waiter pulls the table away for him. 
Don carries the bag under his open coat by the pressure of 
his upper arm. Between his fingers is a cigarette, so that 
the whole thing looks fairly natural. There is a tiny puzzled 
look from the waiter as Don walks slowly towards the wash 
room.

B-43 INT. WASHROOM

It's a two-wash-basin affair, with a colored attendant who, 
as Don enters, is brushing a customer.

               ATTENDANT
     How's about a carnation, sir?

               CUSTOMER
     What for?

               ATTENDANT
          (Chuckling)
     For your buttonhole, sir.

               CUSTOMER
     Okay.

On the shelf above the washstand between talcum powder, nail 
files and brushes, there stands a tumbler with carnations. 
The attendant takes one, puts it into the customer's lapel. 
The customer tips him and walks out.

Don is left alone with the attendant, who points to the other 
bowl, runs fresh water in it.

               ATTENDANT
     Right here, sir.

Don steps to the wash bowl. His brain is functioning 
perfectly.

               DON
     Wipe my shoes, will you?

               ATTENDANT
     Yes, sir.

As Don picks up the cake of soap, he watches the attendant 
get a polishing rag and bend down to dust off his shoes. Now 
Don doesn't lose a split second. He plays his cards like a 
master. He puts down the cake of soap, pulls out the bag, 
opens it. There, between a compact, lipstick and keyes, are 
some bills. He fishes out a ten-dollar bill, thrusts it in 
his pocket and is about to close the purse when he sees the 
carnations. He can't help smiling at the idea which flashes 
into his mind. He takes one of the carnations, puts it into 
the purse, closes the purse and thrusts it back under his 
coat. Just as the attendant straightens up, Don puts both 
hands into the water. The attendant holds out a towel, Don 
wipes his hands.

               ATTENDANT
     How's about a carnation?

               DON
          (Raffles by now)
     I took one.

               ATTENDANT
     You did, sir?

He looks at Don's lapel, mystified,

               DON
     Yes, for a very kind lady.

Don tips the attendant with a fifty-cent piece. The attendant 
doesn't get the joke but chuckles automatically and opens 
the door into the bar.

B-44 THE BAR

The piano isn't being played and the place is strangely quiet. 
Don walks from the wash room, slowly towards his table. 
Suddenly he stops. The space where the lovers sat is empty 
now. That's the storm signal. Don looks around. Near the 
little piano stands Don's waiter, the head waiter, the piano 
player and the lovers. They're staring at Don. In fact, he's 
suddenly aware that he is the focus of every eye in the room. 
In the next second the storm breaks.

               WAITER
     That's him. That's the man.

               HEADWAITER
     You were sitting here, sir?

               DON
     I beg your pardon.

He doesn't play it very well now. M.M.'s escort is right at 
him, grabbing him by the coat.

               M.M.'S ESCORT
     You took this lady's bag, didntcha? 
     Come on, give it back.

               DON
          (With very little 
               hesitation and a wan 
               smile)
     Of course.

He takes the bag out from under his coat and hands it to the 
lady.

               M.M.'S ESCORT
     Somebody call a cop.

               M.M.
     No, George, no. It doesn't matter as 
     long as I have the bag.

               M.M.'S ESCORT
     Well, look in it. Maybe he's taken 
     something.

               DON
     Ten dollars, to be exact.

Don holds out the bill. M. M.'s escort snatches it from his 
hand.

               M.M.'S ESCORT
     I ought to kick your teeth in.

               M.M.
     George, George! He's drunk.

               HEADWAITER
          (Grabbing Don)
     Get out of here.

               WAITER
     How about the check?

               DON
     Exactly. That's why I had to borrow 
     from the lady. I didn't have enough.

He fishes what money he has left from his pocket. The waiter 
snaps it up.

               DON
     I'll come back and pay the rest.

               HEADWAITER
     Don't you show your face here again 
     ever.
          (Shouting towards the 
               entrance door)
     Mike! Mike!
          (To waiter)
     Come on, Charlie.

He and the waiter grab Don, start him towards the door. From 
the street comes Mike, the huge doorman-bouncer. He helps 
with the ejection.

               DON
          (To the entire bar)
     I assure you I'm not a thief. I'm 
     not a thief!

As they drag him toward the entrance door, the pianist, in 
an access of delicate humor, begins to pound the piano and 
sing, "Somebody stole my purse, Somebody stole my purse."

By this time they've got Don to the door. The headwaiter 
gets Don's hat from the checkroom girl's hand. He puts it on 
Don's head, the bouncer pulls him through the door.

B-45 EXT. FIFTY SECOND STREET (NIGHT)

A line of waiting taxis along the brilliantly lighted night 
club street. The bouncer, dragging Don from Harry's and Joe's, 
gives him one last shove down the street.

Don comes to a stop and leans heavily against an iron railing, 
wiping his face with his hand. He straightens his hat, looks 
back. The doorman and the taxi drivers are staring after 
him. Don turns, straightens himself as best he can and starts 
for home, shame weighing down every limb.

B-46 STAIRCASE & FOURTH FLOOR LANDING, BIRNAM APT. HOUSE 
(NIGHT)

It is meanly lighted by the wall brackets. The newspaper, 
the bottle of milk, Helen's note -- are all as they were.

Don drags himself up the last few steps, unlocks the door 
and goes in, leaving paper, bottle and note untouched.

B-47 INT. BIRNAM APARTMENT - DARK

Don has entered. Automatically he switches on the light in 
the corridor. In a stupor of shame and misery he stumbles 
over to the living room couch, flings himself down on it and 
lies covering his face with his arms. After a time he brushes 
the tears from his eyes with his sleeve and as he does so, 
catches sight of something which rivets his attention, brings 
a half-crazed smile to his lips.

On the ceiling is the shadow of the bottle which he hid in 
the light fixture.

With new strength Don gets to his feet, nervous laughter 
shaking him. He pulls the coffee table under the light 
fixture, puts the chair on it, climbs up and retrieves his 
bottle. He climbs down again, opening the bottle fiercely. 
He goes to the table where his empty glass stands, pours it 
half full. Over his face as he looks at the glass of whiskey 
comes the uplifted peace of a worshipper at the high altar. 
There the glass stands, gleaming in the light from above. 
Again the CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES TOWARD IT, immerses in its 
depths. Oblivion again.

                                   FADE OUT:

                    SEQUENCE "C"

FADE IN:

C-1 THE BIRNAM APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM

About 9:30 the next morning. The living room is in the same 
wild disorder -- books on the floor, a table on the chair 
under the ceiling fixture, the couch moved from the wall, 
clothes and shoes spilled from the closet. Two empty bottles 
and a sticky glass stand about, and the portable, with its 
almost virgin sheet of white paper in the roller.

It's a nasty sight, and its nastiness is emphasized by the 
sunlight streaming in and mixing with the yellow pallor of 
the electric light, forgotten and burning on.

Don is not in sight. Only the telephone, which stands on the 
desk next the open portable, is alive. It is ringing at the 
top of its bell.

C-2 BIRNAM APARTMENT - BEDROOM

Here reigns the same confusion: the suitcase flung on the 
floor, the window shade flapping, and on the unmade bed, not 
in it, fully dressed -- shoes, suit, tie -- lies Don, the 
comforter and bedspread pulled up over him.

The telephone rings remorselessly. Don opens his eyes slowly. 
The brightness of the day stabs them, he shuts them. Again 
the telephone.

Don gets up. He is weaker than he thought. Steadying himself 
on the bedpost and holding the door frame, he slowly moves 
out of the bedroom.

C-3 LIVING ROOM

Don enters. He seems to be going straight to the ringing 
telephone, only he isn't. He passes it and goes to the open 
window. He puts his arm against the window frame, presses 
his forehead against it, stands there, every vibration of 
the telephone bell shaking his nerves.

               DON
     Stop it, Helen, stop it, stop it. 
     I'm all right. I just can't talk. 
     Stop it.

There is another ring and another, then the phone stops. 
Don's eyes fall on the bottle and the glass by the big chair. 
He moves slowly towards it, picks up the bottle, holds it 
upside down over the glass. One slow drop is all it yields. 
Don puts down the bottle, goes to the other bottle on the 
mantel shelf, picks it up, goes to the kitchen.

C-4 KITCHEN - BIRNAM APARTMENT

In the sink is the bottle Wick emptied that first afternoon. 
Don picks it up, goes back into the living room.

C-5 LIVING ROOM - BIRNAM APARTMENT

Don goes to the glass, holds the two bottles upside down 
over it. Two more meagre drops emerge, like thick syrup. 
They barely stain the bottom of the glass.

Don puts down the two bottles, picks up the glass, empties 
the pitiable three drops into the parched desert of his 
throat. For a second it seems that he has found some relief. 
That's not true. His need for alcohol has been multiplied 
tenfold by that mockery of a drink. He's got to get another 
bottle, another drink.

What are his finances? Quickly he goes through his pockets. 
In the palm of his hand there are exactly two cents. He looks 
around the apartment. There on the desk stands the typewriter. 
Don walks towards it, rips the sheet of paper from the roller, 
slams the lid of the cover shut, picks up the typewriter. It 
is heavy, terribly heavy. He drags it to the little hall, 
picks up his hat and puts it on.

At the door, weakness overcomes him. Dragging his hand with 
it, the typewriter sinks to the floor.

               DON
     You'll never make it. You'll never 
     make that hock shop. It's a block 
     and a half away.

He is crouched helplessly against the door. At that moment 
the telephone shrills again. Once more Don straightens 
himself, opens the door and leaves.

C-6 OUTER DOOR - BIRNAM APARTMENT

The note from Helen is still pinned to the door. There are 
now two newspapers, two bottles of milk. Don steps over them 
carefully, closes the door and starts down the stairs.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

C-7 EXT. BIRNAM APARTMENT - (SUNNY MORNING)

Mrs. Deveridge and her dog Sophie are outside the apartment 
house. Mrs. Deveridge is talking to Dave, the janitor, who 
leans on his broom.

Don comes from the house with the typewriter. He stops to 
make sure the two are absorbed in conversation, then steps 
quickly past them down the street toward Third Avenue. Looking 
back to see whether they have seen him, he turns into Third 
Avenue and starts uptown.

C-8 THIRD AVENUE

This is to be Don's Via Dolorosa, this black, roaring, 
perilous street up which he, drags the hellish weight of 
that portable -- that portable which grows heavier with every 
step -- in quest of a pawn shop which will give him a few 
dollars for it. A few dollars which will mean drink, drink 
which he needs to live.

Setting his jaw and whipping on his will, he reaches the 
first hock shop. A steel gate is drawn across its entrance. 
Don stares at the obstruction, completely mystified. There 
is a woman standing nearby, wheeling a baby in a baby 
carriage. Don turns to her.

               DON
     This isn't Sunday, is it, lady?

               WOMAN
     Huh?

               DON
     I asked is this Sunday.

               WOMAN
     No, Sattaday. Why?

               DON
     Because it's closed.
          (Looking around)
     Nothing else is closed.

               WOMAN
     Well, somebody passed away, most 
     likely.

Don stands helpless for a moment, then, feeling the woman's 
intrusive stare, straightens up. In the next block, miles 
and miles away for the way he feels, is another pawn shop. 
He starts for it.

Again every step is agony. Overhead the elevated thunders 
excruciatingly. Sweat pours from his forehead. He changes 
the typewriter from one hand to another.

At last he makes the second pawn shop. It too is closed. He 
peers through the iron gate into the dark shop, turns around.

Across the street, in the same block, is the third pawn shop. 
He must make it, but to get there he must cross the raging 
torrent of Third Avenue.

He makes a pillar of the el, leans against it, shaking. When 
a trolley car gets out of his way, he continues to cross the 
street.

That pawn shop is closed too. Don takes a bar and shakes it.

               DON
     What's going on? What is it? Did you 
     all go to a funeral, all of you? 
     Maybe it's you that died, Don Birnam. 
     Maybe it's your funeral.

He pulls himself away and recrosses the street.

Reason has entirely deserted him, but blind instinct drives 
him on.

Sixty-first Street, Seventy-first Street. Four more pawn 
shops, all of them closed. Seventy-ninth Street. He's almost 
struck by a car. The typewriter falls from his hand. A truck 
runs over it but straddles it. Don gets it again.

Up the street, up the street, up the street. One pawn shop 
closed after another. His feet are burning, as if the sidewalk 
were hot lava. His ears are bursting.

Eighty-ninth Street, Ninety-fifth Street. Past bars, funeral 
parlors, children on roller skates, and always the recurrent 
torture of the elevated overhead. On and on, unable to stop.

Finally, half dead, he reaches a pawn shop on 120th St., and 
finds the answer to his crucifixion. Two men in dark suits 
with black bowlers and prayer books under their arms watch 
him as he rattles the closed gate of the pawn shop, almost 
out of his mind.

               1ST MAN
     What's the matter with you?

               DON
     Why are they all closed? They're all 
     closed, every one of them.

               1ST MAN
     Sure they are. It's Yom Kippur.

               DON
     It's what?

               1ST MAN
     It's Yom Kippur, a Jewish holiday.

               DON
     It is.

That makes sense to him. Or does it?

               DON
     What are you talking about? How about 
     Kelly's? How about Gallagher's?

               1ST MAN
     They're closed too. We've got an 
     agreement. They keep closed on Yom 
     Kippur and we don't open on St. 
     Patrick's.

The two men stand grinning.

               DON
          (Almost weeping)
     That's a good joke. That's funny, 
     that's very funny.

He picks up the typewriter, turns and starts walking back. 
THE CAMERA goes slowly up to a sidewalk clock with a diadem 
of three balls, which stands outside the hock shop. The time 
is twenty minutes of one.

                                   VERY SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

C-9 THE CLOCK IN NAT'S BAR

It says five minutes of four. THE CAMERA PANS DOWN. Nat is 
at the bar. He and two or three customers are listening to 
race results on a little radio. Don drags himself in, drenched 
in sweat, his breath as short and agonized as that of a dying 
man. He goes to the end of the bar closest the door, hoists 
the typewriter on it with a final awful effort, leans his 
head on it.

               DON
     Nat --

Nat comes to him.

               NAT
     What's the matter, Mr. Birnam?

               DON
     Let me have one, Nat. I'm dying. 
     Just one.

               NAT
     I thought you were home writing that 
     book.

               DON
     They're playing a trick on me. A 
     dirty trick. Give me one, Nat. I'll 
     pay you when I can. Just don't let 
     me die here.

               NAT
     No credit, and you know it.

               DON
     All right, so it's charity. I'm 
     begging you for one. Give me one.

               NAT
     Yeah, one.
          (Pouring a drink)
     One's too many and a hundred's not 
     enough.

He shoves the drink at Don.

Don is shaking so that he can't pick up the glass. He bends 
down, sucks half of it, then lifts the glass, drains the 
rest. He holds out the empty glass to Nat, his eyes imploring.

               NAT
     That's all.

               DON
     Come on, Nat, come on. I'll let you 
     have my typewriter.

               NAT
     I'm no writer. You're the writer. 
     Now go. Go away.

               DON
     Nat --

               NAT
     I mean it. Get out.

Don takes the typewriter, drags himself out of Nat's place.

C-10 THIRD AVENUE, OUTSIDE NAT'S

Don emerges, starts dragging himself up the street towards 
home. As he passes the antique shop, suddenly he stops. There 
stands the wooden Indian Gloria spoke about, pointing up. 
That's where Gloria lives. Second floor, this same house. 
Don walks into the house.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

C-11 STAIRS AND HALLWAY OUTSIDE GLORIA'S DOOR

This is a really crummy Third Avenue house -- dark woodwork, 
paint peeling from the walls. Beside the door at the head of 
the stairs there are about three bells, for the several 
occupants of the apartment within. Don drags himself up the 
stairs, puts down the typewriter and inspects the name tags 
by the bells. One of them says: GLORIA DE VRIES. Don rings 
the bell beside it. From inside comes:

               GLORIA'S VOICE
     Who is it?

Don rings again.

               GLORIA'S VOICE
     Who is it?

               DON
     It's me.

The door is opened by Gloria. She is wearing a dressing gown 
and bedroom slippers. Her hair is the ruined elaborate 
hairdress of yesterday, and her eyes are blazing with anger.

               GLORIA
     Why, Mr. Birnam, as I live and 
     breathe! Only if you're coming for 
     our date, you're a little late, aren't 
     you, Mr. Birnam? And if you're coming 
     to apologize -- no thanks. Thanks a 
     lot, but no thanks.

               DON
     Gloria --

               GLORIA
     Save your saliva. I've had enough of 
     you. Def, but def. What do you think 
     I am? I break a business date. I buy 
     an evening purse, a facial, a new 
     hair-do. Well, maybe you can do that 
     to your ritzy friends. You can't to 
     me, understand?

               DON
     Gloria.

               GLORIA
     Okay, what do you want, Mr. Don Birnam 
     Esquire?

               DON
     I need some money.

               GLORIA
     You what?

               DON
     Could you let me have some money?

               GLORIA
     Say, you out of your mind? Don't be 
     ridic. Get out of here. Make with 
     those stairs. Go on!

She starts back into the apartment, but Don gets her by the 
hand, pulls her towards him and kisses her. At first she 
resists, then her hand creeps up to the back of his neck, 
clutches it hungrily.

               GLORIA
     I was waiting half the night, like 
     it was the first date I ever had. 
     And the other half I was crying.
          (She looks at him)
     How much money?

               DON
     Could you let me have ten or five, 
     or something?

               GLORIA
     I'll see.

She slips into the apartment, leaving the door about three 
inches a jar. Don leans against the door jamb, breathing 
heavily.

After a couple of seconds Gloria reappears with a wallet. 
She takes five dollars out, gives it to him. Don takes it 
with a shaking hand.

               GLORIA
          (noticing)
     You look awful sick, honey. You got 
     a fever or something?

She brushes his forehead with the back of her hand.

               DON
     I'm all right now.

He takes her hand and kisses it. Gloria looks at him, then 
at her hand.

               GLORIA
     Thank you a lot. You do really like 
     me a little, don't you, honey?

               DON
     Why, natch, Gloria. Natch.

He bends, picks up the typewriter and starts downstairs. 
Gloria looks after him. From inside the apartment comes:

               NAGGING WOMAN'S VOICE
     Gloria, where are you?

               GLORIA
     Coming.

She reenters the apartment, closing the door.

C-12 STAIRCASE - GLORIA'S HOUSE

Don is coming down, holding the banister with his left hand, 
the typewriter in his right. Up the staircase comes a little 
girl about seven, running a stick along the spindles of the 
banister and singing the Hut Sut Song. The sound makes Don 
wince, and as the child gives no sign of yielding precedence 
to him, he switches the typewriter to his other hand and 
leans against the stair wall.

The child passes him. As Don goes on, he slips, starts 
falling, clutches a light bracket trying to check his fall. 
It pulls from the wall under his weight and he falls, 
clutching the typewriter, down the long flight of stairs. A 
terrible, back-breaking fall.

The little girl stands horrified, then starts crying and 
runs up the stairs. For an instant Don lies at the foot of 
the stairs, still clutching the typewriter. His hat has fallen 
off. He struck his head. It is in wild pain. He gets to his 
knees, to his feet, lunges towards the door to the street, 
taking the five dollars from his pocket.

C-13 THIRD AVENUE

Don comes out of Gloria's house, staggers towards Nat's bar, 
the typewriter in one hand, the five dollars in the other.

               DON
     Nat! I've got money now, Nat, I've 
     got money!

The fall has been too much for him. He sinks to his knees, 
drags himself a few feet.

               DON
     I need a straight one, Nat! Quick, 
     quick!

He collapses. People become aware of him -- one, two, four. 
A crowd closes in.

Don lies on the sidewalk, looking up helplessly. His eyes 
are dim. He tries to hold the money up but is too weak. His 
hand drops back. The ring of faces looks down at him, among 
them the familiar face of Nat.

               DON
     Nat. I got the money, Nat.

There is the clang of an ambulance, the shriek of brakes. 
The faces part to let two stretcher-bearers bend over Don 
and take him on a stretcher.

Don is carried to the ambulance as the crowd watches.

The doors of the ambulance are closed. The ambulance starts 
off, bell ringing like mad.

Nat has picked up the typewriter and looks after the 
ambulance, his eyes full of pity.

C-14 INT. MOVING AMBULANCE

Don lies half-conscious, his eyes staring through the 
ambulance window.

C-15 TO C-25 OUT OF THE AMBULANCE WINDOW - (TRANSPARENCIES)

Fleeting impressions of a wild `U' turn on Third Avenue -- 
the elevated, the Chrysler Building, the tall midtown 
structures, the lower houses of downtown, a high iron fence, 
the entrance of Bellevue Hospital.

His eyes close. He loses consciousness.

FADE IN:

D-1 A WIRE BASKET WITH FOUR MILK BOTTLES IN IT

moving away from the CAMERA. Gradually we see that it is in 
the hand of a milkman ascending the stairs of the Birnam 
apartment house. He leaves a bottle by the door of the rear 
apartment on the third floor, one in front of Mrs. 
Deveridge's, then starts up to the fourth floor.

As he gets halfway up, he stops momentarily in surprise.

In the embrasure by the banister at the top of the stairs, 
wrapped in her leopard coat, is Helen St. James, dozing 
wearily. Beyond her is the door to the Birnam apartment, 
Helen's note still pinned to the panel, two milk bottles and 
the newspapers of the last two days on the threshold.

The milkman resumes his walk, careful not to wake up the 
young lady. He deposits a milk bottle beside the others and 
descends carefully. As he reaches the third floor, Mrs. 
Deveridge, in a kimono, has just opened her door and is taking 
in her milk bottle.

               MRS. DEVERIDGE
          (Briskly)
     Good morning.

The milkman gestures to her not to speak so loudly, then 
makes a mysterious gesture of the thumb indicating the upper 
hall. Mrs. Deveridge looks up. The milkman proceeds down the 
stairs. Mrs. Deveridge sets down the milk bottle and goes up 
the stairs. As she goes, she calls sharply.

               MRS. DEVERIDGE
     Anything wrong up there? Anything 
     wrong?

Helen wakens at the first syllable, orientates herself as to 
where she is, and gets up.

               MRS. DEVERIDGE
     Are you all right?

               HELEN
     I'm fine, thank you.

               MRS. DEVERIDGE
     Have you been here all night?

               HELEN
     I've been waiting for Mr. Birnam.

               MRS. DEVERIDGE
     Mr. Don Birnam?

               HELEN
     Yes. I suppose he must have stayed 
     overnight with -- some friends. He 
     has some friends on Long Island.

               MRS. DEVERIDGE
     Now, now, what kind of story is that?

               HELEN
     I beg your pardon?

               MRS. DEVERIDGE
     Look, I'm his landlady. I know what 
     goes on in this house. I know Mr. 
     Don Birnam. I knew all about him the 
     first week they moved here, three 
     years ago. Heard those bottles rattle 
     in their garbage can. I know all 
     about you. You're Don Birnam's girl. 
     I also know he's not staying with 
     any friends in Long Island. He's off 
     on another toot and you know I'm 
     darned right. Now come on down and 
     I'll make you some breakfast.

               HELEN
     I don't care for any breakfast, nor 
     do I care for that kind of talk, 
     even supposing you were right.

               MRS. DEVERIDGE
     Which I am. Now you're going to have 
     some coffee.

They start downstairs, Mrs. Deveridge talking as they descend.

               MRS. DEVERIDGE
     I could have kicked him out fifty 
     times. The last when two taxi drivers 
     dumped him into the entrance hall, 
     out cold on the floor, with all my 
     tenants going in and out, and children 
     leaving for school.

               HELEN
     Oh please, please!

               MRS. DEVERIDGE
     Well, I didn't put him out, not as 
     long as his brother could pay the 
     rent. You couldn't help liking him 
     anyway. He was so good-looking, he 
     had such nice manners. He always had 
     a little joke.

               HELEN
     Stop talking about him as if he were 
     dead.

               MRS. DEVERIDGE
     Did I? I didn't mean to. Hope it 
     wasn't bad luck.

D-2 THE ALCOHOLIC WARD

We start on Don Birnam's face. He is lying on a cot, his 
eyes closed. He has a three-day growth of beard. His face 
has the pallor and immobility of death.

Over the shot come curious sounds of moaning, of incoherent 
mumbling, of slippered feet shuffling along a concrete floor, 
of a mysterious metallic chattering.

Don isn't dead. The sounds reach his ears at last. His eyes 
open for a second. Then his gaze is directed emptily upward.

D-3 THE BILE-COLORED CEILING OF A LARGE ROOM

Over it the same strange noises. Don's eyes (i.E. THE CAMERA) 
slowly descend the bile-colored walls, broken by opaque leaded-
glass windows and the large glassed swinging door leading to 
an outer room. At last the nature of the room itself is 
revealed. It is filled with rows of strangely low cots, about 
thirty of them, standing on dwarf legs. Eight of them are 
occupied by men whose ages range from 20 to 60. Six of them 
are white, two of them colored, All are unshaven and dressed 
in shabby flannel hospital pajamas.

Don's dull eyes don't quite comprehend. His head aches 
furiously. In the cot next him is a man about 50, burrowing 
into the mattress in drunken sleep, his mouth fallen open. 
In the cot opposite him, a very thin young fellow lies shaking 
and sweating profusely. His entire frame, all of it, trembles 
as if a fine motor operated somewhere beneath the mattress 
itself.

On the other side of Don's cot, a huge negro lies babbling 
incoherently. No words are audible, save now and then a 
number. His voice has the sound of infinite worry.

Against the wall, not far from Don, stands a man about 30, 
in a faded terry-cloth bathrobe. He has an incredibly 
sensitive face. One ear is bandaged. He looks as though he 
wanted to crawl into the wall from shame. The rest of the 
men in the cots are sleeping lumps.

Don addresses the man standing against the wall.

               DON
     What's this place?

The man looks at Don but doesn't answer.

               DON
     Hey, you, what's this place?

The man stands staring at him, terrified.

               DON
     I'm talking to you.

The man drifts away eerily.

From the opposite direction comes a male nurse. He is a robust 
guy with a sarcastic mouth. He makes constantly with the 
jokes, all of them at the listener's expense. His name is 
BIM.

               BIM
     Good morning, merry sunshine. How's 
     your head?

               DON
     Where am I? What is this?

               BIM
     This? This is the Hangover Plaza.

               DON
     What hospital is this?

               BIM
     Alcoholic Ward. How's the head?

               DON
     It aches.

               BIM
     We thought you'd fractured her till 
     we seen the X-rays. All in one piece. 
     Just a concussion.

               DON
     Why did they put me in the Alcoholic 
     Ward?

               BIM
     Are you kidding? We took a peek at 
     your blood. Straight applejack. Ninety-
     six proof.

               DON
     What day is this?

               BIM
     Sunday.
          (He holds out the key-
               ring)
     These yours? They fell out of 
     somebody's pocket. You and the colored 
     fellow was being undressed at the 
     same time.

               DON
     They're mine.

Bim throws them at him.

               DON
     Are you a doctor?

               BIM
     Nope. I'm a nurse. Name of Dolan. 
     They call me Bim. You can call me 
     Bim.

He gets a pad and pencil from his pocket.

               BIM
     What's your name?

               DON
     Birnam.

               BIM
     What kind of Birnam?

               DON
     Don Birnam.

               BIM
     Where do you live?

               DON
     Two hundred and nine East Fif -- 
     Say, what do you need that for?

               BIM
     For the post card.

               DON
     What post card?

               BIM
     To your folks, so's they'll know 
     where honey-boy is and where they 
     can pick him up when he's feeling 
     better.

               DON
     No address.

               BIM
     Okay. We'll get it out of the 
     telephone book, or the directory, or 
     maybe you've got it in your wallet.

               DON
          (On his feet)
     No post card. Understand? Nobody's 
     going to pick me up.

               BIM
     The management insists. If we let 
     you guys go home alone a lot of you 
     don't go home. You hit the nearest 
     bar and bounce right back. What we 
     call the Quick Ricochet.

               DON
     Listen, I'm as well as you are. I 
     can leave right now.

               BIM
     You think so?

               DON
     Where are my clothes?

               BIM
     Downstairs.

               DON
     How do I get out of this place?

               BIM
          (Pointing to the glass 
               doors)
     Right through here.

Don has risen. He is wearing flannel pajamas like all the 
rest of the patients. There are canvas slippers on his feet. 
He is not quite as steady on his pins as he thought. However 
he manages to make the swinging glass door.

Bim stands quietly watching him, a great big grin on his 
face.

D-4 THE ANTE-ROOM

It is L-shaped, about fourteen feet wide. Along the walls 
are benches and a collection of wheel-chairs. Sitting on 
them and milling aimlessly around, are some thirty alcoholics. 
They wear terry-cloth bathrobes over their pajamas, canvas 
slippers on their feet. They are well on their way to 
normality, but they are still not a pretty sight -- unshaven, 
bunged-up, shame-faced.

In the listless, burned-out collection, Don is the only person 
who moves with purpose. He scarcely notices the men as he 
passes them, intent on finding the door. He goes around the 
bend of the ell and there is the door, a heavy wooden one 
with a grated peep-hole and beside it a uniformed guard. Don 
goes to the door, tries to open it.

               GUARD
     Where do you think you're going?

               DON
     To get my clothes.

               GUARD
     You got your discharge?

               DON
     My what?

               GUARD
     Your release?

               DON
     I'm all right. Let me out.

At this moment the door is opened by another male nurse, 
carrying a pile of clean sheets and pillow cases. Don tries 
to take advantage of the opening of the door to get out, but 
the guard pulls him by the arm, while the entering nurse 
locks the door with his own key.

               GUARD
     Go on, get back.

               DON
     Keep your hands off me.

Over the shot comes:

               BIM'S VOICE
     Birnam!

Don turns, At the bend of the corridor stands Bim, with a 
tumbler of medicine in his hand.

               BIM
     Come here, Birnam.

Don approaches him slowly.

               DON
     Is this a jail?

               BIM
     Well, this department -- it's kind 
     of halfway hospital, halfway jail, 
     but we run it more like a flophouse.

He guides Don back toward the ward, CAMERA AHEAD OF THEM.

               DON
     Listen, Bim, in my clothes there's 
     five dollars. That's for you if only 
     you won't send that post card.

               BIM
     Nothing doing.

               DON
     I don't want anybody to know.

               BIM
     Listen, your folks might as well get 
     used to our little post cards,

               DON
     What are you talking about?

               BIM
     There'll be more of them, You'll be 
     back.

               DON
     Shut your face.

               BIM
     Listen, I can pick an alky with one 
     eye shut. You're one and you'll come 
     back. They all do.

He points at a man in a wheel-chair,

               BIM
     Him, for instance. He turns up every 
     month, just as sure as the gas bill.
          (He points at another 
               man)
     And him there. That's another 
     repeater. This is his forty-fifth 
     time. Big executive in the advertising 
     business, A lovely fellow. Been coming 
     here ever since 1927. Good old 
     prohibition days. You should have 
     seen the place then. Say, this is 
     nothing. Back then we had really a 
     turnover. Standing room only. 
     Prohibition! That's what started 
     half these guys off. Whoopee!

They have reached the ward by now.

D-5 THE WARD

Bim seats Don on his bed.

               BIM
     Now lie down like a good boy and 
     drink this.

               DON
     What is it?

               BIM
     Doctor's orders. It'll calm you down.

               DON
     I don't want it.

               BIM
     You better take it. Come the night 
     there's apt to be a little floor 
     show around here. Might get on your 
     nerves.

               DON
     Floor show?

               BIM
     Didn't you ever have the D.T.'s?

               DON
     No.

               BIM
     You will, brother.

               DON
     Not me.

               BIM
     Want to make a small bet? You're 
     just a freshman. Wait till you're a 
     sophomore. That's when you start 
     seeing the little animals.
          (He holds out the 
               drink)
     Drink it.

               DON
     I don't want it.

               BIM
     That stuff about pink elephants, 
     that's the bunk. It's little animals. 
     Little tiny turkeys in straw hats. 
     Midget monkeys that come through the 
     key-holes. See that guy in the corner?

He points to the man with the sensitive face, who stands 
against the wall.

               BIM
     With him it's beetles. Comes the 
     night, he sees beetles crawling all 
     over him. Has to be dark, though. 
     It's like the doctor was saying to 
     me, "Delirium is a disease of the 
     night." Well, good night.

And on the grinning face of Bim,

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

D-6 THE WARD - (NIGHT)

It is lighted by a faint blue light, but the lights are on 
in the anteroom and some light comes through the glass doors. 
There are the sounds of a ward full of drunken men -- sighs, 
heavy breathing, snoring, babbling, moaning. On his cot lies 
Don, his eyes wide open. Suddenly there comes a sharper sound -- 
a violent slapping of a bed. Don pivots in the direction of 
the sound.

On a cot in the corner is the man with the sensitive face 
and the addiction to beetles. He is slapping wildly at his 
bed, moaning. He rises and begins to slap the wall and scream.

Don stares at him through the dimness.

Through the glass doors come two male nurses with flashlights. 
They run to the cot of the D.T. victim. There is a wild 
scrabble as he fights them off. One of the nurses races back 
to the door and calls:

               NURSE
     Straitjacket! And the doctor!

By now, from several other beds in the ward comes demented 
screaming. A third nurse races in, throws a straitjacket to 
the first nurse, hurries to one of the other beds.

Seen through the glass doors, a doctor comes running down 
the ante-room, followed by another male nurse with a cart on 
which are hypodermic syringes, etc. The doctor must have 
been in another building, because over his shoulders is flung 
a dark blue overcoat. He enters the ward and dashes in the 
direction of the beetle patient. As he goes, he tosses the 
overcoat on the empty cot next Don.

Don looks after the doctor, then is fascinated by the coat 
lying beside him. In the corner the three nurses and the 
doctor are working over the beetle patient, the doctor giving 
him a hypo, the nurses getting him into the straitjacket. 
The ward is now really going off like a bunch of firecrackers.

               DOCTOR
          (To the nurses)
     Get him up to the violent ward.

From the cot on the other side of the ward, the third male 
nurse calls:

               3RD MALE NURSE
     Help me with this one, will you, 
     Doc?

The doctor goes to him while the nurses drag the beetle 
patient through the swing door into the ante-room.

Don slips from his bed and, crouching on the floor, pulls 
the doctor's coat from the cot and, holding it tight, crawls 
to the swinging glass doors and slides through them.

D-7 THE LIGHTED ANTE-ROOM

It is empty save for the two nurses, who are leading the 
beetle patient around the bend of the ell. In a crouching 
position, Don makes his way down the ante-room, holding the 
coat close. At the bend he looks.

The two nurses with the beetle patient have reached the outer 
door, beside which stands a night guard.

               1ST NURSE
     Violent ward. Get the elevator.

The guard opens the door and leads the way. The nurses drag 
the patient out.

Don makes his way to the door, glances through the peephole, 
then sneaks out.

D-8 CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE WARD

The guard, the two nurses and the patient are at the elevator. 
Don sneaks behind them, through the door to the fire stairs.

D-9 FIRE STAIRS

Don runs cautiously down, putting the coat on as he goes. He 
feels something in the pocket, takes out a package of 
cigarettes, matches, a couple of nickels. He hurries down 
the stairs.

D-10 GROUND FLOOR CORRIDOR OF HOSPITAL

A guard stands at the steps leading from the main entrance 
to the psychiatric hospital. He is talking with three female 
nurses. Don slides behind them and out the entrance, which 
is by now grey with the cold dawn.

D-11 EXT. ENTRANCE TO PSYCHIATRIC WARD

Don comes out, orientates himself quickly, runs through the 
gate and up the deserted street.

D-12 A STREET IN THE 20'S

Deserted except for a water wagon. Don runs up it toward the 
entrance of the elevated.

D-13 THE STAIRS OF THE ELEVATED

Don runs up them just as a train rattles in. THE PANNING 
CAMERA catches the train as it leaves for uptown.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

D-14 DON - IN THE ELEVATED (PROCESS)

He sits watching the first rays of sunlight strike the tall 
buildings in the East 40's. The train comes to a stop and 
Don gets up.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

D-15 43RD STREET - ABOUT 6:30 IN THE MORNING

Don comes from the elevated, hurries down the street. CAMERA 
PANS with him. Don stops in front of a shop. On its window 
is painted LIQUOR AND WINES, and a couple of bottles are in 
the foreground. It is closed. Don crosses the street and 
stations himself in front of the building opposite, leaning 
against an iron railing.

Elderly people pass him and go up some steps. Slowly Don 
becomes aware that he is standing in front of a church and 
the people are going to morning mass.

THE CAMERA PANS up the church to the cross on its gable, 
then SWINGS ACROSS to the Chrysler Building opposite, now 
bathed in bright sunlight. As the CAMERA PANS along the clear 
sky,

                                   DISSOLVE:

D-16

THE CAMERA CONTINUES DOWN to the one-story building which 
houses the liquor shop. It is 9 o'clock by now and the owner, 
a middle-aged man in hat, coat and muffler, is just unlocking 
the door.

Don, tormented by the long wait, sees him open it and starts 
to cross the street.

D-17 INT. THE LIQUOR STORE

The proprietor enters, hangs up his hat, takes off his muffler 
and is about to take off his coat when Don comes in. The 
scene between the two is played very quietly.

               DON
     I want a quart of rye. Quick.

               PROPRIETOR
     All right if I take off my coat first?

               DON
     No.

The proprietor senses that there is something wrong. He looks 
at Don. As his gaze reaches Don's pajama trousers and canvas 
slippers. Don speaks.

               DON
     No cracks, no questions. Just a quart 
     of rye.

The proprietor grasps that this is no joking matter. He picks 
up a bottle.

               PROPRIETOR
     That'll be two fifteen.

               DON
     Give it to me.

               PROPRIETOR
     Two fifteen.

               DON
     Come on. I need that liquor, I want 
     it, I'm going to get it. I'm going 
     to walk out of here with that quart 
     of rye, understand. One way or 
     another.

There is murder in his eyes. The proprietor is completely 
under the spell of that terrible glance. He hands over the 
bottle. Don takes it and walks out. The proprietor takes a 
few steps toward the door as if he were about to summon help 
and catch Don, then he thinks better of it. With a what-the-
hell gesture, he starts taking off his coat.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

D-18 EXT. THE BIRNAM APARTMENT HOUSE

Don, holding the bottle under his blue coat, slips quietly 
past Mrs. Wertheim's laundry and into the entranceway. He 
looks inside, to be sure he is not observed, then fishes the 
keys from his pajama pocket, where Bim dropped them, and 
opens his mail box. The post card is there. He takes it out, 
crumples it and, putting it in the pocket of his over-coat, 
goes inside the house.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

D-19 INT. THE BIRNAM APARTMENT

Don enters, looks around the apartment, which is still in 
utter disorder. The electric lights, burning on heedlessly, 
offend him and he snaps off the light switch. Automatically 
he takes the chain to hook it into its socket, but misses 
the socket. The chain slips down and dangles.

Don, not noticing, walks to his big chair. On the small table 
next it stand the three empty bottles. He sweeps them to the 
floor. He takes the new bottle from his pocket and, sinking 
into the big chair, starts opening it.

On the desk behind him, the telephone starts ringing. He 
doesn't seem to hear it. Without winking an eyelash, he pours 
his glass half full, lifts it so that glass and hand obscure 
his face.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

D-20 THE APARTMENT (NIGHT)

In the dark sits Don, passed out. The bottle next him is 
four-fifths empty. He opens his eyes, still in a half-stupor, 
stares straight before him. Out of the corner of one eye he 
sees something and slowly and with difficulty turns his head.

In the wall above the couch, close to the door, there is a 
hole in the plaster, as if left by a large nail carelessly 
withdrawn so that some of the plaster went with it. Out of 
the hole peers a small mouse.

At first Don draws back, repelled, but the mouse is such a 
friendly, harmless creature that after a moment his face 
relaxes and he half smiles at it.

Just as he does so, from the direction of the window there 
whirs past him a strange winged thing. It is a bat, swooping 
in slow loops around the room. Don crouches into the back of 
his chair, staring in wild distaste. The top of the bat's 
hooked wing nicks his forehead as it speeds in swift but 
fluttering flight straight at the mouse.

Don stiffens against the back of his chair.

The bat has made another swoop and spread its wings over the 
mouse. Beneath those black wings some hideous pygmy struggle 
is going on. Apparently the bat has seized the mouse in its 
claws.

Don gives a cry of horror.

Now from behind the struggling wings comes a spurt of blood.

Don cries out so hard his throat seems to burst apart, buries 
his horrified eyes in the back of his chair.

From downstairs comes the barking of Mrs. Deveridge's dog.

D-21 STAIRCASE TO THE FOURTH FLOOR AND THIRD FLOOR LANDING

Mrs. Deveridge stands about four steps up, looking at the 
door to the Birnam apartment. She must have been listening 
from Don's first scream. Sophie, standing beside her, is 
barking wildly. Beyond her, the door to her apartment is 
open.

               MRS. DEVERIDGE
     Shut up, Sophie! Shut up!

Dragging Sophie after her, she hurries into her apartment.

D-22 LITTLE ENTRANCE HALL OF MRS. DEVERIDGE'S APARTMENT

The telephone is on the table by the door, a memorandum pad 
beside it. Mrs. Deveridge picks up the phone and, glancing 
at the pad, dials a number.

               MRS. DEVERIDGE
          (Into phone)
     Miss St. James?... He's back. He's 
     upstairs... This is Mrs. Deveridge. 
     He's back! In the apartment. I heard 
     him yelling. He's just got to remember 
     that there are other tenants... Miss 
     St. James? Miss St. James?

Helen has obviously hung up. Mrs. Deveridge, a little 
indignant, does the same.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

D-23 INT. BIRNAM APARTMENT

Don still cowers in his chair, his face hidden in his arms, 
his breathing heavy with terror. From outside comes the sound 
of footsteps racing upstairs toward his door, then the door-
bell: short, short, long short.

Don's eyes turn slowly toward the door. His brain is still 
functioning, for there is new terror in those eyes.

D-24 EXT. DOOR OF BIRNAM APARTMENT

Helen stands outside, ringing the bell. No answer.

               HELEN
     Don, open the door. Open it, please.

Still no answer and she raps on the door.

D-25 DON, INT. APARTMENT

He sits staring at the door, holding his breath not to betray 
his presence.

               HELEN'S VOICE
     Don, won't you let me in? I know 
     you're there. Please open the door.

Don doesn't move, doesn't answer.

D-26 HELEN, AT THE DOOR

               HELEN
     Don, don't you hear me? I want to 
     help you.

She bangs on the door, rattling the doorknob helplessly.

D-27 DON

staring at the door.

               HELEN'S VOICE
     I won't go away, Don. Do I have to 
     get the janitor with the pass key to 
     let me in?

Don sits bathed in sweat, tears of terror in his eyes.

D-28 HELEN AT THE DOOR

She turns and runs down the stairs. Mrs. Deveridge stands in 
her door, peering up. She hurries to the stairwell and calls 
down it.

               MRS. DEVERIDGE
     Dave! Dave!

               DAVE'S VOICE
     Yes, Mrs. Deveridge?

               MRS. DEVERIDGE
     Come on up with the pass key.

D-29 DON, INT. APARTMENT

His eyes are on the door. Now they focus ON THE DOOR CHAIN. 
It is not hooked in place but hangs limply. Don realizes 
he's forgotten to put it up, but it's not too late, is it? 
With a desperate effort he flings himself to the floor and 
starts inching his way to the door.

D-30 STAIRS LEADING TO THE FOURTH FLOOR

Dave, the janitor, a ring with labelled keys on it in his 
hand, leads Helen and Mrs. Deveridge up the stairs.

D-31 INT. BIRNAM APARTMENT

Don is almost at the door. There is the sound of ascending 
footsteps. With his last strength Don raises himself against 
the door, stretches out his hand, gets the door chain, tries 
to slip it in its notch, but misses. The foot-steps have 
stopped by now. There is the noise of a key being pushed 
into the key-hole. Don tries again, but by this time the 
door is open. Don throws all his weight against the door but 
it is no use.

D-32 OUTSIDE THE DOOR

Dave has opened the door and holds it open as far as he can. 
Helen slips into Dave's place in the doorway. From behind 
the door comes the sound of Don's agonized breathing.

               HELEN
          (Holding the doorknob)
     Thank you very much.

               MRS. DEVERIDGE
     You'd better let us come too. You 
     can't go in there alone.

               HELEN
     I'll be fine, thank you.

She stands waiting until Dave and Mrs. Deveridge start 
downstairs.

D-33 INT. THE APARTMENT

Don crouches behind the door. A shaft of light comes from 
the corridor. Helen enters, closing the door behind her. She 
kneels down beside Don.

               HELEN
     Don, darling --

               DON
     Go away, Helen.

               HELEN
     I'm here to help you, Don.

               DON
     No, no.

               HELEN
     Look at you. How long is it since 
     you've had anything to eat?

Don doesn't answer.

               HELEN
     You want to get up, Don. Put your 
     hand on my shoulder.

Don blindly does as she says.

               HELEN
     You'll have a bath. I'll help you 
     shave. You'll eat and sleep, and 
     when Wick comes back everything will 
     be all right.

They are beside the light switch. Helen snaps it on.

               DON
     No, Helen, no!

               HELEN
     What's the matter, Don?

               DON
     The wall. Don't look.

               HELEN
     What wall?

Don gestures toward the spot where the bat and the mouse 
were.

               DON
     The mouse and the bat.

               HELEN
     What mouse? What bat?

               DON
     That hole in the wall --

               HELEN
     There isn't any hole in the wall. 
     Look.

She leads Don toward it. He stares at the smooth, unstained 
wall.

               HELEN
     See?

Don runs his hand over the wall.

               HELEN
     You had some kind of a nightmare.

She leads him into the bedroom, talking as they go.

               HELEN
     Stop shaking, Don. Everything will 
     be all right. I'll stay right with 
     you.

She seats him on the bed. Don is panting hard, completely 
oblivious of the fact that Helen is in the room.

               DON
     Little animals. It's always little 
     animals. That's what Bim said.

               HELEN
     You're not making much sense.

She turns on the bed lamp.

               DON
     And do you know what Nat said about 
     the ending? Like this.
          (He snaps his fingers 
               vertically)
     Or like that.
          (He snaps them 
               horizontally)

He goes on repeating the gesture, growing despair in his 
eyes.

                                   FADE OUT:

                              END OF SEQUENCE "D"

                    SEQUENCE "E"

FADE IN:

E-1 A WINDOW IN THE BIRNAM APARTMENT - TUESDAY MORNING

It is raining outside and from the eaves comes a steady drip 
in the exact rhythm in which Don snapped his fingers -- "like 
this, or like that, like this or like that."

THE CAMERA PANS to include the whole living room. Helen lies 
asleep on the couch, using the pillow and the comforter from 
Wick's bed. She is wearing Wick's foulard dressing gown. The 
room is all tidy now. On the armchair near the kitchen door 
lies Helen's leopard coat.

In the door to the bedroom stands Don. Now that he is shaved, 
we can see how pale his face is. He wears the dark suit (the 
one he wore to the opera) and as his eyes shift from Helen 
to the coat, he is just tying his tie. He has not yet buttoned 
the buttons on the points of his soft collar. Very cautiously 
he begins to tiptoe toward the chair. He picks up the leopard 
coat and starts towards the entrance door. He opens it 
carefully but it does creak a little.

Just as he is slipping out, comes --

               HELEN'S VOICE
     Don! Don!

Don shuts the door behind him. In the next second Helen 
hurries into the shot. She is barefooted, just wearing the 
foulard dressing gown. She flings open the door and runs 
out.

E-2 FOURTH FLOOR LANDING AND STAIRS

Helen runs to the banister and looks down. Don has already 
reached the second floor and is hurrying down the stairs, 
the fur coat over his arm, not paying any attention to Helen.

               HELEN
     Where are you going, Don?

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

E-3 EXT. PAWN SHOP, THIRD AVENUE - LIGHT RAIN

Don is just coming from it. He walks down the street about 
ten steps when Helen comes up to him. She wears the dress 
she wore last night. No hat, no coat.

               HELEN
     All right, Don. Give me the pawn 
     ticket.

Don disregards her, tries to go on. Helen overtakes him and 
blocks his way.

               DON
     No scene, please.

               HELEN
     No scene. Just give me the pawn 
     ticket.

               DON
     I don't want you to go in there now 
     claiming it. It would look queer.

               HELEN
     You're ashamed of what the pawn broker 
     may think, is that it? It doesn't 
     matter what I think.

               DON
     Wick'll get you back your coat.

               HELEN
     You couldn't have taken my bracelet 
     or my pay check? It had to be that 
     coat?

               DON
     You mean the one that brought us 
     together? Stop being sentimental.

               HELEN
     I have, Don, I assure you. It's 
     finished. It's dead. For three years 
     they couldn't talk me out of you. I 
     was the only one who really understood 
     you. I knew there was a core of 
     something... And there was a core, 
     and now I know what it is. A sponge. 
     And to soak it full you'll do anything 
     ruthless, selfish, dishonest.

               DON
     I asked you not to make a scene.

               HELEN
     Then give me the ticket.

               DON
     No, Helen, not now I told you. Cut 
     it out.

               HELEN
     I don't want the money. You can get 
     as drunk as you like for all I care.

               DON
     Thank you.

He goes on. Helen stands looking after him for a moment, 
then turns angrily and proceeds toward the pawn shop.

E-4 INTERIOR PAWN SHOP #1

The pawn broker has put Helen's coat on a hanger and is 
brushing it. Helen enters, very matter-of-fact.

               HELEN
     A gentleman was here a while ago. 
     How much did you give him for that 
     coat?

               PAWN BROKER
     Huh?

               HELEN
     I want it back. It's my coat.

               PAWN BROKER
     It's your coat?

               HELEN
     It's all right. He had my permission. 
     How much did you give him?

               PAWN BROKER
     He didn't want any money. He wanted 
     to swap it.

               HELEN
     For what?

               PAWN BROKER
     Something he hocked here a long while 
     back.

               HELEN
     What?

               PAWN BROKER
     A gun. Now if you want that coat I 
     can --

Helen is already out of the shop and running down the rainy 
street.

                                   DISSOLVE:

E-5 DON'S DESK

On it lies a revolver and the second page of a letter on 
which Don is writing:

...But amid all the grimness can we share one little joke, 
dear Wick: I did finish something, didn't I? Goodbye. Don.

E-6 THE BIRNAM APARTMENT

Don is seated at the desk. As he has been out in the rain, 
his hair is still a little damp. He puts down the pen, gets 
up, stands the letter conspicuously on the desk, picks up 
the revolver, gets the cartridges from the drawer and loads 
the gun. With a last look at the room, he walks into the 
bathroom.

Don stands and looks at himself in the mirror, the gun in 
his hand. He notices the unbuttoned points of his collar and 
with a rueful smile at the funny timing of his urge for 
tidiness, buttons one. As he is buttoning the second, there 
is a sound from outside. Startled, Don puts the gun into the 
empty wash bowl.

The door is being opened. Dave, the janitor, is letting Helen 
in. She looks around wildly. She is breathing hard from her 
race to get there. There is rain on her hair and her face, 
and her dress is wet.

Don comes from the bathroom. Helen stands staring at him, 
wiping the rain from her face, and maybe some tears too.

               DON
     What is it, Helen?

               HELEN
          (To the janitor)
     Thank you very much.

               DAVE
     That's all right, Miss.

He leaves, closing the door. Don and Helen are alone. During 
the following scene, Helen's eyes are constantly on the 
lookout for the gun.

               DON
     What's the matter? Come on.

               HELEN
     Nothing's the matter, except the 
     rain's worse and I can't get a taxi. 
     Perhaps you can lend me a coat under 
     the circumstances.

               DON
     Sure. How about my raincoat?

He takes it from the hook.

               HELEN
     Funny, after all these years we should 
     wind up just as we met -- I with 
     your raincoat --

               DON
     And I with your leopard coat. I always 
     got the best of the bargain. Goodbye, 
     Helen.

               HELEN
     Goodbye.

She stands looking about.

               DON
     What are you looking for?

               HELEN
     I just thought if you had anything 
     for my head --

               DON
     Would you care to wear my black 
     bowler?

               HELEN
     Some old scarf or something.

               DON
     All right.

He steps to the chest of drawers in the bedroom.

Helen, looking around desperately, sees something reflected 
in the shaving mirror: THE GUN IN THE WASH BOWL.

Before she can step toward it, Don is back with the scarf.

               DON
     Here you are.

               HELEN
     Thanks.

               DON
     Well, goodbye.

               HELEN
     Oh, Don, there was still some whiskey 
     left in the bottle when I cleaned up 
     last night.

               DON
     Was there?

               HELEN
     Would you like to know where I put 
     the bottle?

               DON
     No.

               HELEN
     Don't you want a drink, Don?

               DON
     No.

Helen goes to the umbrella stand, takes out the bottle.

               HELEN
     Just one. Look, it's right here.

She puts down the raincoat and the scarf and goes to the 
kitchen for a glass.

               DON
     What are you up to?

               HELEN
     Nothing. I'm just ashamed of the way 
     I talked to you, like a narrow-minded, 
     insensitive, dried-up, small-town 
     teetotaller.

               DON
     I don't feel like a drink. Not now, 
     I told you.

               HELEN
     Come on, Don. Just one. I'll have 
     one with you. I'm in no hurry. This 
     is my easy day at the office.

               DON
     Helen, there are a few things I want 
     to put in order before Wick comes.

               HELEN
     Let me stay.

               DON
     No.

He picks up the raincoat and the scarf.

               DON
     I'm sorry. You'll have to run along.

He bends down for a kiss. Helen stands looking at him.

               DON
     Don't let me bend for nothing.

Helen holds out the glass.

               HELEN
     You need this, Don. Drink it. I want 
     you to drink it. I'll get you some 
     more. I'll get you all you want.

               DON
     What kind of talk is that?

               HELEN
     It's just that I'd rather have you 
     drunk than dead.

               DON
     Who wants to be dead?

               HELEN
     Stop lying to me.

She turns and runs into the bathroom and picks up the gun. 
Don follows her.

               DON
     Give it to me.

Helen holds it behind her.

               DON
     Helen!

Helen turns toward the window, lifting her arm to throw the 
gun out. Don catches her arm and twists it.

               DON
     Let go!

Helen drops the gun.

Don picks up the gun.

               DON
     Go on now.

He half pushes, half leads her into the entrance hall.

               DON
     And no fuss, please. Don't call in 
     the neighbors. It won't do any good, 
     I promise you.

               HELEN
     I won't. You've made up your mind. 
     Could you tell me exactly why?

               DON
     Because it's best all around, for 
     everybody. For you, for Wick, for 
     me.

               HELEN
     That's not true. We love you, Wick 
     and I.

               DON
     All right. Just for me, then. Selfish 
     again.

               HELEN
     That's a sad final word, Don.

               DON
     Look at it this way, Helen. This 
     business is just a formality. Don 
     Birnam is dead already. He died over 
     this weekend.

               HELEN
     Did he? What did he die of?

               DON
     Of a lot of things. Of alcohol, of 
     moral anemia, of fear, of shame, of 
     D.T.'s.

               HELEN
     Oh, that Don Birnam. And now you 
     want to kill the other one.

               DON
     What other?

               HELEN
     There were two Dons. You told me so 
     yourself. Don the drunk and Don the 
     writer.

               DON
     Let's not go back to a fancy figure 
     of speech. There's one Don, and he's 
     through.

A wave of weakness overcomes him and he sags against the 
door.

               HELEN
          (With a gesture toward 
               him)
     Don --

He pushes her away.

               DON
     I'm all right. I have enough strength 
     left.

               HELEN
     I know you have. I can see it. Don't 
     waste it on pulling a trigger, Don.

               DON
     Let me get it over. Or do you want 
     me to give you another one of my 
     promises that I never keep?

               HELEN
     I don't want you to give me your 
     promise. I don't want you to give 
     your promise to anybody but Don 
     Birnam.

               DON
     To me? It's too late. I wouldn't 
     know how to start.

               HELEN
     The only way to start is to stop. 
     There's no cure besides just stopping.

               DON
     Can't be done.

               HELEN
     Other people have stopped.

               DON
     People with some purpose, with 
     something to do.

               HELEN
     You've got your talent, your ambition.

               DON
     Talent. Ambition. That's dead long 
     ago. That's drowned. That's drifting 
     around with a bloated belly on a 
     lake of alcohol.

               HELEN
     It's not. You still have it.

               DON
     Oh, Helen, I couldn't write. What do 
     you expect, a miracle?

               HELEN
     Yes, yes, yes! If I could only make 
     you see --

The buzzer sounds.

               DON
     Who is it?

               NAT'S VOICE
     It's me, Mr. Birnam.

               DON
     What is it, Nat?

               NAT
     I got something for you.

Don goes to the door and opens it. Nat stands outside holding 
something under his wet raincoat.

               NAT
     You know when you had your accident? 
     Well, afterwards I found this floating 
     around on the Nile.

He pulls out Don's typewriter.

               DON
     Thank you, Nat.

               NAT
     She writes real good. I oiled her up 
     a little. And I didn't oil her up so 
     you can hock her.

Helen comes up.

               HELEN
     I'll take it, Nat.

               NAT
     Hello, Miss.

Helen takes the typewriter, carries it toward the desk.

               NAT
     Goodbye, everybody.
          (Discreetly, to Don)
     How's all them lilacs in Ohio?

               HELEN
     Well, Don. here it is. What do you 
     say now?

               DON
     Say about what?

               HELEN
     This. Someone, somewhere, sent it 
     back. Why? Because He means you to 
     stay alive, because He wants you to 
     write. I didn't ask for a big miracle.

               DON
     Write! With these hands?
          (He holds them out; 
               they are trembling)
     And a brain that's all out of focus?

               HELEN
     It'll clear up again. You'll be well.

               DON
     And I'll be sitting there in front 
     of that white piece of paper, scared.

She puts a cigarette in his mouth, lights it.

               HELEN
     No you won't. You've forgotten what 
     it feels like to be well.

               DON
     And what will I write about? What?

               HELEN
     What you always wanted to write. 
     Where's that page?
          (She picks it up)
     "The Bottle. A Novel by Don Birnam." 
     What was that going to be?

               DON
     About a messed-up life. A man, a 
     woman and a bottle. Nightmares, 
     horrors, humiliations, things I want 
     to forget.

               HELEN
     Put them on paper. Get rid of them 
     that way. Tell it all, to whom it 
     may concern. It concerns so many 
     people, Don.

               DON
     Yeah.

               HELEN
     I'll fix us some breakfast.

She starts into the kitchen.

               DON
     We have quite a supply of milk.

Helen goes into the kitchen, puts the gun away, runs water 
into the percolator.

               DON'S VOICE
     You'll notice I didn't even find a 
     first line.

               HELEN
     Of course you couldn't write the 
     beginning because you didn't know 
     the ending. Only now --

She looks into the living room and her face freezes.

Don has risen from the couch and has picked up the glass of 
whiskey. There's a second of hesitation, then he uses it for 
an ashtray, dropping the cigarette into it.

A smile of relief comes on Helen's face.

               HELEN
     Only now you know the ending.

Don has sunk back on the couch again.

               DON
     I'll send one copy to Bim, one to 
     that doctor who loaned me his coat, 
     and one to Nat. Imagine Wick standing 
     in front of a book store. A great 
     big pyramid of my books. A Novel by 
     Don Birnam. "That's my brother, you 
     know."

Helen enters the shot.

               HELEN
     That's by my fellow. Didn't I always 
     tell you?

               DON
     I'm going to put the whole weekend 
     down, minute by minute.

               HELEN
     Why not?

               DON
     The way I stood in there, packing my 
     suitcase...

                                             SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

E-7 FIRST SHOT OF THE PICTURE

Only this time in reverse: We start with Don standing on 
that sunny day in the bedroom, packing. THE CAMERA MOVES 
AWAY, GOES DOWN THE WALL to the bottle hanging there, and 
MOVES ON ALONG THE BACK OF THE FACADE OF THE APARTMENT to 
the splendid panorama of New York.

               DON'S VOICE
          (continuing)
     Only my mind wasn't on the suitcase, 
     and it wasn't on the weekend. It 
     wasn't on the shirts I was putting 
     in, either. My mind was hanging 
     outside the window. It was suspended 
     about eighteen inches below the 
     sill... And out there in that great 
     big concrete jungle, I wonder how 
     many others there are like me. Poor 
     bedevilled guys, on fire with thirst. 
     Such comical figures to the rest of 
     the world, as they stagger blindly 
     towards another binge, another bender, 
     another spree...

                                   FADE OUT:

                         THE END
