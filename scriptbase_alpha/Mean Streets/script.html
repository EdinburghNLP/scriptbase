          A darkened diffused image of a man lying on the ground. A
          tree is above him. The image is more diffused on the edges.
          It is black and white, and appears to be coming from a

          was educated in Roman Catholic Parochial schools with one
          year and a half at a Jesuit college. CHARLIE was raised
          sternly in the Roman Catholic tradition but now has rejected
          many of the religion's tenets. He is very intelligent and
          has a sharp sense of humor. He is always well dressed. His
          favorite authors are Ernest Hemingway, Thomas Hardy, and
          Theodore Dreiser. He likes reading but enjoys films more.
          He is very fond of the New Testament and often exchanges
          quotes from it with his friend TONY.

          up to look at his face in the mirror. His room is lit by
          moonlight. It is a small tenement bedroom with a fire-

<b>          INT. PARTY - HOME MOVIES - DAY
</b>                         
          Opening TITLES appear over 8mm. HOME MOVIES in which
          CHARLIE is shown along with his friends and family in a
          celebration...a sense of "one big unending party."
                         
          During this opening segment WE SEE some of the characters
          that will later appear in the story: JOHNNY BOY, MICHAEL,
          TONY, TERESA, CHARLIE'S UNCLE GIOVANNI, and others. They
          are all Sicilian and are members of the same Italian-
          American neighborhood in New York City. (WE SENSE, from
          these HOME MOVIES, that the neighborhood forces its people
          to be strongly tied together in a way of life - Family,
          Church, Friendship.) These HOME MOVIES were taken during
          some formal and casual gatherings in which CHARLIE
          participated.

          A longhaired "freak" is about to shoot-up. Suddenly the
          door opens and TONY (ANTHONY DEVENZIANO) comes in. TONY is
          totally different in appearance and dress from the "freak."
          He is 25, and a part time student studying liberal arts.
          His father is a very powerful racketeer in a different part
          of the city and owns several night club type discotheques
          and strip houses on the west side of town. One of these is
          operated by TONY - "TONY'S PLACE." CHARLIE is one of his
          closest friends. TONY is well dressed, flippant and reckless.
          He is a big drinker, liquor, wine, and even cough medicine.

          TONY rushes over to the "freak", who is too strung out to
          defend himself, smashes the needle, and slaps him around.

          and slaps him in the back of the head knocking off his hat.

<b>          EXT. WEST SIDE DOCKS - LATE AFTERNOON

          The area is totally deserted except for two trucks parked
          side by side. Two men are tossing boxes from one truck to
          another and looking around furtively. MICHAEL stands nearby.
          MICHAEL LONGO is 26 years old. He lives in a different
          neighborhood but comes from the same type of background as
          CHARLIE and the others. He runs an illegitimate bar and
          dabbles in the yearly sale of firecrackers which he smuggles
          in from Maryland. He also deals in contraband cigarettes
          and runs a small-time "loan shark" business. He has a knack
          for business but he is otherwise unintelligent.
                         
          Michael crosses over to a '58 black Oldsmobile.

          MICHAEL gets in the car. Another MAN is sitting in the back.
          He is also well dressed. MICHAEL takes a small lens out of
          his pocket and tosses it to the MAN.

<b>          EXT. STREET - DAY
</b>                         
          A deserted warehouse area in lower Manhattan. Prominent in
          the frame is a brightly painted red white and blue mailbox,
          contrasting with the drab hues of the neighborhood.
                         
          JOHNNY BOY walks down the street toward camera. JOHN
          CIVELLO (JOHNNY BOY) is 23 years old. He is an only child
          and lives with his mother, a divorcee. He is clean cut
          looking, yet slightly radical in dress. He was expelled
          from high school for vandalism and consequently spent
          several months in reform school. He is reckless,
          unambitious, nihilistic, and was classified a psychiatric 4-
          F. He is first cousin of TERESA RONCHALI who lives next
          door to CHARLIE. He has adopted TERESA'S family as his own
          and spends more time with them than he does with his mother.
                         
          JOHNNY is carrying a package wrapped in plain brown paper
          under his arm, and he is smiling. He drops the package into
          the mailbox and keeps walking. But he is moving a little
          faster now and smiling a little more.
                         
          Suddenly the mailbox explodes. Dozens of red, white and
          blue fragments shower down on the street. The impact of the
          blast knocks JOHNNY down. TITLE APPEARS on bottom of frame:

          He is up in a moment. The CAMERA TRACKS with him as he
          starts running. WE SEE that he is grinning - quite
          literally - like crazy.

          WE SEE CHARLIE full face. Behind him is a Confessional
          Booth. The church is very old, quiet, and dark. The CAMERA
          ZOOMS OUT to reveal rows of Holy Candles lit in the
          foreground. CHARLIE suddenly begins to speak softly and
          confidentially to an unseen entity that is OFF SCREEN.

          THE CAMERA HAS NOW TRUCKED BEHIND CHARLIE AND WE SEE over
          his head he has been addressing a life sized statue of the
          crucified body of Christ, eyes closed reclining in his
          sepluchure.

          This conversation of Confession will occur from time to time
          in other parts of the story as CHARLIE will periodically try
          very casually to justify his thoughts and actions to his
          "God." The images accompanying these monologues are to be of
          free association almost documentary in nature.

          The club is dark and noisy and smokey when CHARLIE enters.
          He greets TONY who is sitting on a bar-stool. TONY directs
          CHARLIE to a corner of the club where the rest of the group
          is now getting boisterously drunk.

          The rest of the club is filled with many different types of
          customers: teenagers, adults pretending to be teenagers,
          sailors, male and female gays, and "the boys from the
          neighborhood." The music is loud and the lights are flashing
          but the strippers have not yet appeared.

          TONY is at the bar. He is approached by GEORGE one of the

          CHARLIE's zany behavior as frenetically as it occurs. There
          is no particular logical sequence except that events are
          suited to the rythmic pattern of the music.
                         
          1. CHARLIE and his friends dance and sing along with the
           music.
                         
          2. CHARLIE picks up a billiard stick. He attempts to hit a
           filled shot glass towards TONY at the other end of the
           bar. He fails.
                         
          3. CHARLIE tries to pull a tablecloth off of a stranger's
           table without moving the glasses or bottles. This also
           fails.

          4. A punch is thrown at someone. A lit cigarette in the
           puncher's fist creates a swift arc of light in the
           darkness.
                         
          5. The Strippers finally appear on stage. CHARLIE becomes
           obsessed with the Negro stripper DIANE. He shouts to
           her, tosses things, and calls her names. She tries, half
           amusedly to ignore him but she can't.
                         
          6. TONY drinks from a bottle of Southern Comfort, and as a
           chaser swigs down Aqua Velva.

          CHARLIE is at the corner table with TONY and JOHNNY BOY.
          CHARLIE is washing JOHNNY BOY'S face with cold water from a

          dazed. His sudden silence causes CHARLIE and the others to

          To the BOY's surprise the DRUNK does not immediately fall
          dead. Instead, he turns and grabs the BOY by the throat.

          CHARLIE lives in a typical lower east side tenement apartment.
          Each room is painted a different pastel color. It is
          furnished in miscellaneous styles and from the pictures on
          the wall and various knick-knacks around the rooms it is
          evident that this is a family apartment rather than a
          bachelors pad.
                         
          CHARLIE is helping his mother pack a suitcase. Through out
          the scene he is addressing her but she is never seen on
          CAMERA. The CAMERA PANS following his movements and CHARLIE
          directs his conversation always towards but above and beyond
          it.

          A SERIES OF DISSOLVES. TERESA is going through the various
          stages of getting dressed.
                         
          TERESA RONCHALI is 30 years, well built, attractive and
          intelligent. She is well read and quiet. The salary she
          makes as a secretary in a book publishing firm practically
          supports her family. She has epilepsy which has prevented
          her (in her own mind) from entering into any serious
          relationships with men. She has however, been having an
          affair with CHARLIE for the past year. It is a well kept
          secret from both families because the families regard each
          other as blood relations.
                         
          CHARLIE is startled by JOHNNY BOY who is now awake and has
          begun to dial the telephone.

           right... thanks. Look, I demand
           immediate action. Never mind my

          CHARLIE shakes his head with an exasperated smile as if this
          was a common occurance. CHARLIE turns back to look at
          TERESA but she is no longer in her room.

          ejaculates prematurely - However, he doesn't ejaculate
          sperm - instead blood. They are shocked. The blood is on

          CHARLIE is sitting in a quiet corner of the restaurant.
          This restaurant was considered an above average business
          with quality and prices to match when it was first opened
          three years ago. The quality has diminished but the prices
          remain the same. As a result the place is dying. CHARLIE
          is scrutinizing the restaurant from his corner. He picks up
          a water goblet and critically examines the water spots on it.
          He calls a waitress to show her the dirt on the glass. She
          apologizes, cleans it with her apron, and places it back on
          the table. He takes a menu.
                         
          A chubby, middle-aged man, OSCAR, approaches the table. He
          is half owner of the decaying restaurant. He is in his
          shirt sleeves which, along with the side of his face, are
          smeared with grease and dirt. He is tired and disgusted.

          GIOVANNI De STEFANO is sixty. He is well respected and

          A man is putting new records into the jukebox which is in
          the corner of the room in the luncheonette area.

          CHARLIE walks through the luncheonette area, past the dining
          room where his uncle is in conference, to the bathroom at
          the very back of the cafe. MARIO is seated with his uncle.
                         
          MARIO is forty five years old. He is GIOVANNI'S closest
          associate, brought into the organization in the traditional
          manner, making his early reputation through hits (murders).
          He is not very intelligent but has an undying loyalty to
          GIOVANNI, and is very fond of CHARLIE.
                         
          MARIO and GIOVANNI are seated with a very old man. They are
          deep in their private conversation. CHARLIE passes by
          unnoticed and walks into the bathroom.
                         
          CHARLIE begins to wash his hands but changes his mind. He
          shuts off the faucet in order to eavesdrop on the
          conversation.

          approaches and gives him his cup of coffee... The following

</b>           Yes, I'd say there are some
           Columbian coffee beans in this
           coffee, but only about 39%.
                         
          MARIE is disinterested. CHARLIE continues.

           beans are rich coffee beans.
           Bursting with that good, deep
           coffee flavor. Picked when they
           are ripe to the point of perfection.
           The beans of course, are protected
           by the tall South American Guama
           trees.
                         
          MARIE chews her gum for a moment and leaves the table.
          CHARLIE'S monologue continues and gradually he falls back
          into his CONFESSION. As he talks, the CAMERA PICKS UP
          DETAILS of the cafe and the people in it.

</b>           Then the bean pickers come down and
           pick each bean by hand. Bean by
           bean, all heavy with flavor. And
           they load them into boxes, one box
           at a time, box by box.
                         
          From time to time CHARLIE is casually glancing at MARIE who
          is busy with her work.

          TONY enters the bathroom, turns on the light and locks the
          door. Party noises can be heard in the background TONY is
          wearing an overcoat and is dressed as a World War I "dough
          boy". Atop his head is a mask, the features of which can't
          be seen. He opens the coat to reveal twenty packets of red
          Jello. He turns on the hot water in the bathtub and slowly
          begins to empty each packet of Jello into the tub of steaming
          water.

          Most of the characters that were at the club the other night
          are present at the party. Many of them are dressed in semi-
          masquerade outfits. Some are wearing soldiers' uniforms.
          One wears a sheet made up to be a Roman Toga. The girls are
          in costumes also. All of the costumes are makeshift.
          MICHAEL is made up as Dracula, sporting a large cape, semi
          tuxedo-type suit, and a drop of blood on the corner of his
          mouth. His hair is slicked back to give him a "Bela Lugosi"
          look. He is showing a picture of a girl to one of the boys,
          proudly proclaiming that she is his latest conquest. TONY
          comes out of the bathroom and passes by. He takes the photo
          from MICHAEL. Group attention focuses on TONY now. He
          stares at the picture, holds it away from him, then closer
          to his face, then sideways and finally upside-down.

           under a bridge in Jersey, making
           out with a nigger.
                         
          MICHAEL grimaces in shock. He spits.

          He wipes his lips with his cape.
                         
          The guest of honor, the young soldier is very drunk. He is
          attempting to open his going away presents, one of which
          turns out to be a carefully folded American flag. He
          attempts to open it with one great flourish. He fails
          however, knocking over the glasses on the table. The group
          applauds.

          Suddenly, the doorbell rings and everyone looks up. The
          door opens and CHARLIE appears, arms outstretched, dressed
          as the ressurected Christ - with white robes, fake beard and
          hair, and artificial wounds. His arms stretch out wider.
          The initial shock wears off and TONY greets him.

          They all laugh. The rock music blares as CHARLIE walks to
          and fro blessing all in the room. TONY is delighted with
          the scene. CHARLIE sits at the kitchen table, TONY opposite
          him, and the others gather around. The party is getting
          noisier. TONY gives CHARLIE a glass of ice cubes. CHARLIE
          plays the part of a priest, during the Mass when the chalice
          is filled with wine and water, TONY pours the scotch over
          his fingers first.
                         
          CHARLIE lifts his hands to touch the bottle as a priest
          would. He signifies that there is enough in the glass.
          TONY then repeats the same ritual with a bottle of soda-water.

          Everyone drinks after repeating the toast. The crowd around
          them begins to break up as CHARLIE and TONY begin to have
          fun with each other. TONY pulls down his mask, revealing a
          skeleton death face which covers his own face except for his
          mouth. It completes the Dough-boy uniform quite well.

          JOHNNY BOY closes his eyes. CHARLIE looks at JOHNNY BOY and
          then looks at the cemetary in the moonlight. It seems
          totally apart from the city with the sirens and cars far in
          the distance.
                         
          CHARLIE stands and unravels his robes, preparing to take
          them off. He projects the image of Christ delivering a
          sermon. Music and laughter in the distance catches his
          attention. The lights and the music are coming from the top
          floor of a tenement building where a Puerto Rican family is
          having a party. The sound echoes through the streets.
          Decorations are hanging and blowing away through the open
          windows. As CHARLIE watches a fight break out over one of
          the girls. Screams are heard. People run up and down the
          fire escape.
                         
          CHARLIE has pulled off the robe. He now removes the beard
          and wig and has become himself again. He leans over to find
          JOHNNY BOY fast asleep on a tomb.

          CHARLIE is furious. JOHNNY BOY points to TERESA who is
          getting worse.

          CHARLIE lunges out at JOHNNY BOY shoving him halfway down
          the stairs. He has gotten hold of his coat so that JOHNNY
          BOY can't leave. Neighbors from downstairs open their doors
          and come up the stairs. CHARLIE, in complete panic, tries
          to put something into TERESA'S mouth while holding JOHNNY
          BOY at the same time. He shoves his hand into her mouth
          trying to pry it open but she bites into it. CHARLIE
          screams as the blood streams out. He lets go of JOHNNY BOY.

          The last song of the festival is ending now. As the singers
          come to a stirring climax they wave and shout in Italian.
                         
<b>                          SINGERS

          The band plays a few bars of "Home Sweet Home." The singers
          throw kisses to the dispursing crowd. People who have been
          watching the festival pull down the blinds of shades and go
          in.

          CHARLIE is being put into an ambulance. He is muttering to

          Early morning. A door in the far corner of the room opens.
          CHARLIE is motioned through by a cop, who shuts the door
          immediately behind him. There is an unnaturally loud
          clanging sound that echoes in the room. CHARLIE looks
          around, still a little dazed, and spots MARIO standing over
          by the door. MARIO has made no move to greet him. He just
          stands there watching. CHARLIE walks over to him, sensing
          something a little ominous.

          MARIO says nothing, just nods at him to step outside.
          CHARLIE goes out into the street. MARIO follows.

          There is practically no one on the street. The early
          morning light makes everything a clammy grey. CHARLIE waits
          at the bottom of the steps.

          up his bag from the sidewalk and walks into the terminal.

          The place is huge and there is a lot of bustle and excitement.
          CHARLIE is noticeable because he is the only member of the
          crowd who walks slowly, without any apparent mission or
          destination. He makes his way toward the large flight board
          that looms over the whole room. Loudspeakers announce
          planes to and from every part of the world. On the flight
          board, the origins and destinations of the days flight spin
          and change every moment. He passes the insurance machines
          and almost stops - more upset than before. A businessman
          calmly pays for insurance. (Muzak is heard) CHARLIE
          continues on past a novelty shop where some plastic crosses
          and St. Christopher medals hang alongside the stuffed toy
          dogs and flight bags. He looks at the cross.

          The ticket desk is under the flight board. CHARLIE eventually
          works his way over to the desk, drops his bag on the floor
          and stands staring at the board. He sees the names of
          dozens of cities flashing before him. As he watches, a
          pretty ticket clerk speaks to him from behind the desk.

          CHARLIE stares at the flight board in dismay and indecision.
          He apparently does not hear her.

          CHARLIE hears her this time. He reaches into his jacket
          pocket and pulls out the ticket which he passes across to
          her. The clerk starts to open it to check the destination.

          The question is unusual. The clerk looks up. CHARLIE stare
          back at her with a quality that is almost defiance.
