The future is set for Tony and Michael - owning a neighbour- hood bar and making deals in the mean streets of New York city's Little Italy.
For Charlie, the future is less clearly defined.
A small-time hood, he works for his uncle, making collections and reclaiming bad debts.
He's probably too nice to succeed.
In love with a woman his uncle disapproves of (because of her epilepsy) and a friend of her cousin, Johnny Boy, a near psychotic whose trouble-making threatens them all - he can't reconcile opposing values.
A failed attempt to escape (to Brooklyn) moves them all a step closer to a bitter, almost preordained future.
