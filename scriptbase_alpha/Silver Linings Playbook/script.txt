           What, are you kidding me? Sundays?
           I love Sundays. I live for Sundays.
           The whole family's together. Mom
           makes braciole. Dad puts the jersey
           on. We're all watching the game.
           Yeah, it drives me crazy, and yes,
           I was negative.

          FADE IN ON:

          INT. KAREL PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY/PAT'S ROOM - DAY

          PAT SOLATANO stands in the middle of his room, his back to
          camera.

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           You didn't even know that I loved
           it, Nikki, but I did. I just didn't
           appreciate it, or you, before."
          There is a knock at the door.

           MALE ORDERLY (O.S.)
           Come on. Time to go.

                          PAT
           I lost all that. I blew it. But you
           also blew it. We can get it back.
           We're gonna get it back. It's all
           gonna be better now. I'm better now
           and I hope you are, too. And I'm

                          GONNA APPRECIATE--"
          Another knock at the door. Pat ignores it.

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           Hey, I'll be there in a minute,
           okay?

           MALE ORDERLY (O.S.)
           Doctor's waiting. Let's go.

                          PAT
           I'll be there in a minute.
          Pat returns to his speech.

           That's true love.
          See glimpses of Pat's room: mayonnaise jar filled with water,
          black trash bag strewn on the bed, handwritten sign taped to

          DRINKS WATER, OPENS MOUTH WIDE AND STICKS HIS TONGUE OUT to
          show he swallowed.

          PAT WALKS, SPITTING OUT THE PILL. PILL LANDS ON FLOOR.

           Yeah, that's when I had long hair.
           People say I talk about my hair too
           much.

           And it was just the way I wanted
           it, but he cut it back too far. He
           cut this side back too far trying
           to even it up. I didn't tell him to
           do that. I said, "Just cut it the
           way you cut it...."

                          PAT
           Once you get in the right frame of
           mind, I think anything's possible.
           I think we get, we so often get
           caught in this state of negativity
           and it's a, it's a poison like
           nothing else.

          RED TOE NAILS IN A WHITE FLAT SANDAL --

           DR. TIMBERS
           ...technically, you can take him
           out against our recommendation,
           but you assume a lot of liability
           in the eyes of the court. And he's
           just getting used to the routine
           here.

                          DOLORES
           I don't want him to get used to the
           routine here. Eight months is
           already long enough.

           Hey, Mom. Can we give Danny a ride
           to North Philly?

          DOLORES STOPS THE CAR.

           Mom, no, it'll be fine. It'll be
           fine.

          DANNY OPENS THE REAR PASSENGER SEAT AND GETS INTO THE CAR

          WITH HIS SUITCASE.

                          DANNY
           I guess everybody's leaving today!
           Hello, Mrs. S. An honor to finally
           meet you. Pat told me all about
           you, how God made you rich in
           character, and you're the mighty
           oak that holds the household
           together, and not to mention the
           lasagna you make on game day when
           the Birds play.

           Danny was in for assault because of
           crystal meth and alcohol.

                          DANNY
           Bad combination.

                          PAT
           Yeah. On top of an anxiety
           disorder.

                          DANNY
           That was when I was an X-ray
           technician with my ADD and my
           anxiety. I had a lot of access to
           medication and I took advantage of
           it. That's when my hair was long,
           too. But my hair only grew when I
           was older. When I was younger, my
           hair didn't grow because my
           brother...

                          (TO PAT)
           Remember I told you about my
           brother, he had a Jheri curl, and I
           couldn't get a Jheri curl because
           my hair didn't grow long enough. I
           was so jealous of my brother...

           It looks great now.

                          DANNY
           You like it?

                          PAT
           It's good now.

           Yes, it is.

                          DOLORES
           (into cell phone)
           What? Are you sure about that? I'll
           bring him back right away.

          DOLORES HANGS UP.

                          DOLORES (CONT'D)
           You lied to me, Pat. Danny's not
           allowed to leave.

           It's insanity. He spikes the ball

           -the remotes like this? Did you do
           this, Randy?

                          RANDY
           No, I don't touch them. As a matter
           of fact, I don't know why you need
           so many. Hey, there she is! Look

           PAT SR. (CONT'D)
           So what, you don't talk to me? You
           didn't tell me you took him out.

                          DOLORES

                          PAT
           You didn't tell Dad you were

                          DOLORES
           Don't worry about that.

           PAT SR.
           I wanna make sure when you come out
           that you're okay, and she didn't
           say anything. (to Dolores) You
           didn't tell me?

                          DOLORES
           The court said yes. Don't worry.

           12.

                         

           PAT SR.
           Yeah, but what did the doctor say?
           Because the, the court listens to
           the doctor.

                          PAT
           Yeah, and the court said--

           PAT SR.
           The court listens to the doctor,

                          THE DOCTOR--

                          PAT
           Dad, relax. The court said it's
           fine, okay? Let it go.

                          DOLORES
           Don't worry.

                          PAT
           Dad, I'm in there because of the
           court. That's the agreement that we
           made months ago. It was a plea
           bargain with the courts. The
           lawyer, he instructed me, he said
           that what we should plead that, and
           then I would serve eight months and
           then I'd get out.

           PAT SR.
           Yeah, no, I just--

                          DOLORES
           It's all under control.

           PAT SR.
           Well...okay, okay. Congratulations.

                          PAT
           Thank you. So what are you doing

                          PAT
           How you gonna pay for it?

           PAT SR.

           about it.

                          PAT
          From your bookmaking?

           PAT SR.
          Who told you that?

                          PAT
          Mom told me. Outside.

                          DOLORES
          I did not. No, I didn't.

                          PAT
          You just told me outside, Mom, what
          are you talking about? Five minutes
          ago, we were walking up the stairs,
          you said, "Don't say anything, but
          Dad lost his job and he's
          bookmaking."

           PAT SR.
          Why, Dolores? Why did you say that
          to him? He has the wrong idea.

                          (TO PAT)
          Everything's fine, Patrick. I'm
          more concerned about you than
          anything else.

                          PAT
          Good, Dad. Good.

           PAT SR.
          Okay, the question, the big
          question, is what are you gonna do
          with yourself?

                          PAT
          What am I gonna do? I'm getting in
          shape, I'm getting trim, I'm
          getting really fit for Nikki. I'm
          gonna read Nikki's teaching
          syllabus and get my old job back.

           PAT SR.
          Nikki sold the house. She left.
          Didn't your mother tell you that?

                          PAT
          Let me tell you something. You
          don't know anything about my
          marriage, okay, Dad? All right? Our
          marriage...we're very, very much in
          love, okay? Just like you two.

           PAT SR.
          Listen, Patrick, she's gone. She's
          not around anymore. Nikki left.

           14.

                         

                          PAT
           What are you doing, Dad? You know
           what? Excelsior. Excelsior.

           PAT SR.
           What does that mean?

                          PAT
           It means you know what I'm gonna
           do, I'm gonna take all this
           negativity and use it as fuel and
           I'm gonna find a silver lining,
           that's what I'm gonna do. And
           that's no bullshit. That's no
           bullshit. That takes work and
           that's the truth.

           She's pregnant. And they escape up
           into the mountains and they're
           gonna be happy, and they're gonna
           be drinking wine and they dance --
           they both like to dance with each
           other, there's scenes of them
           dancing, which was boring, but I
           liked it, because they were happy.

           DR. PATEL
           All right. Can you talk about
           something that you did, before or
           after?

                          PAT
           Yeah, about a week before the
           incident, I called the cops and I
           told them that my wife and the
           history guy were plotting against
           me by embezzling money from the
           local high school, which wasn't
           true. It was a delusion. And we
           later found out from the hospital
           that's because I'm, uh...

           DR. PATEL
           ...undiagnosed bipolar.

                          PAT
           Yeah. With mood swings and weird
           thinking brought on by severe
           stress, which rarely happens, thank
           God. And then the shower incident
           happened and that's when everything
           snapped, so I then realized that,
           oh, wow, I've been dealing with
           this my whole life. And without any
           supervision I've been doing it all
           on my own with no help and
           basically I've been white-knuckling
           it this whole time.

           Yeah. It's a lot to deal with,
           especially when you don't know what
           the hell is happening, which I do

           Here, let me give you a hand. I'm
           sorry. I'm being rude.

                          NANCY

           Let me ask you something. Let me
           just ask you something. Does Nikki
           still work here?

                          NANCY
           You know I can't tell you that. But
           Doug Culpepper is still here.

                          PAT
           Why would you tell me that? You
           know he broke up my marriage. What,
           are you being, a troublemaker?

                          NANCY
           You know, you look good. Did you
           lose a lot of weight?

           I'm not a complainer anymore. I'm a

                          NANCY
           You just have to give it some time.

           Cool, man. Wow, you lost a lot of

           Thank you.

           I'm sorry I didn't visit you in the
           hospital. You know, work's out of
           control, you know, she had the
           baby. I'm really glad you're back.
           I missed you. I really need someone
           to talk to. You gotta come see the
           baby. She's beautiful. And Veronica
           wants to make dinner for you.

           Congratulations on the baby, but
           I'm not buying the invitation.

                          RONNIE
           That's not true.

                          PAT
           Yes, it is. Nikki always said that
           "Ronnie's wife keeps his social
           calendar where she keeps his balls,
           in her purse."

           Okay, it's a little true. But if
           you think she still hates you,
           you're wrong because why would she
           tell me to invite you to dinner?
           Hmm?

                          VERONICA
           Did you invite him?

           threw a trick play, a pitch out to
           Randal El. Andy Reid wastes a time-
           out challenging it, loses the
           challenge, loses the game. You're
           in this house, please show some
           respect for what I do. And we
           should spend time together anyway.
           I'm trying to keep you out of
           trouble, please.

                          PAT

                          PAT
           You know what, I knew why they
           invited me over. I knew it.

           PAT SR.

           Oh, no way!

           PAT SR.
           She--, no, she might be with him.
           She's afraid of you. She doesn't
           want to talk to you.

                          PAT
           No way, Dad. You mean, Doug

           Yeah? Missus Solatano, Mister
           Solatano, I'm Officer Keogh. I work
           this beat. Look, I heard about the
           restraining order. And I heard you
           went to your old house and the
           school. It's not okay. I've been
           assigned to your case, so you're
           gonna be seeing a lot of me. Do
           yourself a favor. Respect the
           restraining order, okay? Five
           hundred feet.

           PAT SR.
           You hear what he just said? You
           have a restraining order.

                          PAT
           Yeah, Dad, I know.

           DR. PATEL
           Tell me one thing. Would you like
           to be a guy who goes back to jail
           or to the hospital? Hmm? So take
           your medication and if you do fine,
           we'll reduce them.

                          PAT
           Nikki's waiting for me to get in
           shape and get my life in order, and
           then she's gonna be with me. And
           that's better than any medication.

           35.

                         

           DR. PATEL
           Pat, there's a possibility, and I
           want you to be prepared for it,
           that she may not return. True love
           is about letting her go and seeing
           if she returns. In the meantime, if
           you listen to that song, I don't
           want you to fall apart. So get a
           strategy, okay? You need one.

                          PAT
           Let me say something, I gotta say
           something.

           DR. PATEL
           Okay.

                          PAT
           This is what I believe to be true.
           This is what I learned in the
           hospital. You have to do everything
           you can, you have to work your
           hardest, and if you do, if you stay
           positive, you have a shot at a
           silver lining.

           DR. PATEL
           Work on a strategy, okay?

                          PAT

           for.... I don't know, my mom got
           this Gap outfit she wants me to
           wear, but I wanna wear a jersey
           that my brother, Jake, got me from
           the Eagles.

           DR. PATEL
           Which jersey?

                          PAT
           DeSean Jackson.

           DR. PATEL
           DeSean Jackson is the man.

                          VERONICA
           You mean rookie of the year?

                          RONNIE
           Yeah.

                          VERONICA

                          (TO BABY)
           DeSean Jackson? DeSean Jackson?
           (noticing Pat) Oh, you wore a
           jersey to dinner.

                          RONNIE
           Isn't it awesome?

                          VERONICA
           Not for dinner.

                          RONNIE
           Look, he got us flowers.

                          VERONICA
           Oh, that's sweet. (to Pat) That's
           sweet, Pat. That's lovely.

                          RONNIE
           And wine.

                          PAT
           Hey.

                          VERONICA
           Hey.

                         

          INT. RONNIE'S HOUSE/DEN - EVENING


          RONNE AND PAT HAVE A MOMENT. A FRAMED PHOTO OF RONNIE,

          VERONICA AND THE BABY ON THE WALL.

                          RONNIE
           Check this out. We just redid the
           whole thing.

                          PAT
           Wow!

          RONNIE LAUGHS.

           38.

                         

                          PAT (CONT'D)
          Tremendous. Tremendous.

                          RONNIE
          Isn't it great?

                          PAT
          Tremendous.

                          RONNIE
          Yeah, man, I'm, I'm thinking of
          redoing it again.

                          PAT
          Why?

                          RONNIE
          Because.

                          PAT
          Gotta be making a lot of paper to
          do that.

                          RONNIE
          Yeah, we're doing all right, man. I
          can't complain.

                          PAT
          Isn't the market down, though?

                          RONNIE
          It is down, but you know, she wants
          more, so I'm giving her more, man.

                          PAT
          Hey, you know my dad lost his
          pension.

                          RONNIE
          I'm sorry, man.

                          PAT
          Yeah.

                          RONNIE
          A lot of people. My uncle, too.

                          PAT
          Really?

                          RONNIE
          Yeah, but you know what? No
          disrespect, it's not personal, but
          this is the time to strike.

           You start snapping up commercial
           real estate -- cheap -- flip it
           over, you flip it over and that's
           when you make the money. But the
           pressure...it's like....

          RONNIE GLANCES, LOOKING FOR VERONICA.

                          PAT
           You okay?

                          RONNIE

                          (WHISPERING)
           I'm not okay. Don't tell anybody.
           Listen to me. I feel like I'm
           getting crushed and--

                          PAT

                          (WHISPERING)
           Crushed by what?

                          RONNIE

                          (WHISPERING)
           Everything. The family, the baby,
           the job, the fucking dicks at work,
           and it's like, you know, like I'm
           trying to do this, (Ronnie reaches
           for his throat, mimicking trying to
           breath) you know, and, and, and I'm
           like...suffocating.

          RONNIE COVERS HIS FACE WITH ONE HAND.

                          PAT
           Holy shit.

                          RONNIE
           You can't be happy all the time.

                          PAT
           Who told you you can't be happy?

                          RONNIE
           It's all right. You just do your
           best, you have no choice.

                          PAT
           That's not true at all.

                          RONNIE
           You just can't.

                          PAT
           Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie!

          THE DOORBELL RINGS.

                          RONNIE
           I hope you're okay with Veronica's
           sister coming over. You okay with
           that?

                          PAT
           Who?

                          RONNIE
           Veronica's sister.

           PAT AND RONNIE

                          (IN UNISON)
           Tiffany.

                          PAT
           Tiffany and...Tommy?

                          RONNIE
           Yeah. Just Tiffany.

                          PAT
           What happened to Tommy?

                          RONNIE
           He died.

                          PAT
           Tommy died?

                          RONNIE
           Cops die.

                          PAT
           How'd he die?

                          RONNIE
           Please, don't bring it up.

                          PAT
           No, how did he die?

                          TIFFANY
           How did who die?

          PAT LOOKS UP TO SEE VERONICA'S SISTER TIFFANY ENTER: THEY
          LOCK EYES IMMEDIATELY. SHE IS TALL, STRIKING, INTENSE. She
          walks to Ronnie and Pat, who is unsure how to behave.

                          RONNIE
           Hey, Tiffany! This is Pat. Pat, my
           sister-in-law Tiffany.

                          PAT
           You look nice.

           41.

                         

                          TIFFANY
           Thank you.

                          PAT
           I'm not flirting with you.

                          TIFFANY
           Oh, I didn't think you were.

                          PAT
           I just see that you made an effort
           and I'm gonna be better with my
           wife, I'm working on that. I wanna
           acknowledge her beauty. I never
           used to do that. I do that now.
           `Cause we're gonna be better than
           ever...Nikki. Just practicing.
           How'd Tommy die?

          TIFFANY IS STUNNED. RONNIE CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT PAT JUST SAID.

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           What about your job?

                          TIFFANY
           I just got fired, actually.

                          PAT
           Oh, really? How?

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           I mean, I'm sorry. How'd that
           happen?

                          TIFFANY
           Does it really matter?

          TIFFANY AND PAT FACE EACH OTHER. VERONICA ENTERS IN BG.,

          VISIBLE THROUGH A PASS-THROUGH WINDOW INTO THE KITCHEN.

                          VERONICA
           Baby, how's it going?

                          RONNIE
           Great, great.

                          VERONICA
           Everyone having fun? We're gonna go
           on a tour now. We're gonna go on a
           tour now.

                          TIFFANY

                          (TO PAT)
           Let's go see the house.

                          RONNIE
           Come on, let's go for the tour.

           42.

                         

           VERONICA (O.S.)
           I've, I've been planning this
           forever. I love our house. I love
           our house. I'm really excited about
           it.
          Tiffany looks back over her shoulder at Pat, intensely.

                          RONNIE

          A SILVER FRAME MOUNTED ON THE WALL.

                          VERONICA
           Guess what it is.

                          PAT
           Oh, it's a television.

                          TIFFANY
           It's a computer screen.

                          RONNIE
           Nope.

                          VERONICA
           Just keep going, keep going, keep
           going.

                          PAT
           It's a brick oven, it's a brick
           oven.

                          TIFFANY
           It's a light. It's a...

                          VERONICA
           Ooh, ooh, warmer, warmer, warmer.

                          TIFFANY
           ...it's a drawer at a morgue where
           they pull out dead bodies and shoot
           them with formaldehyde.

                          VERONICA
           Don't think so hard, don't think so
           hard.

                          PAT
           Where would the dead body...where
           would the body go, though? `Cause

          VERONICA SHOWS OFF AN OUTLET ON THE WALL.

                          VERONICA
           We have a port in every room. Gimme
           an iPod. Who, who doesn't have an
           iPod?

                          PAT
           Well, I don't have an iPod. I don't
           even have a phone. They won't let
           me make any calls. They think I'm
           gonna call Nikki.

                          RONNIE
           Don't worry about it. Don't focus
           on that.

                          PAT
           I would call Nikki.

                          RONNIE
           I'm actually gonna give you one of
           my iPods. I have an old one.

                          VERONICA
           Gimme your iPod.

          RONNIE HANDS AN IPOD TO VERONICA.

           Give it to me. Thank you, baby,
           thank you.

          VERONICA PLUGS THE IPOD INTO THE OUTLET.

                          TIFFANY
           Of all the rooms there are iPod
           ports in, I'm happy you brought us
           into the bathroom.

           I can play music for the baby in
           any room.

                          PAT
           Can you play "Ride the Lightning"

           Pat was a history sub at the high
           school, Tiffany. Ask him about any
           president, he knows 'em all.

                          PAT
           Here's a fun fact. You know where
           the term "OK" comes from?

                          VERONICA
           No. No, I don't.

                          RONNIE
           Where?

                          PAT
           Well, Martin Van Buren, the eighth
           president of the United States of
           America, is from Kinderhook, New
           York...

                          VERONICA
           Oh.

                          PAT
           ...and he was part of a club, a
           men's club, called Old Kinderhook.
           And if you were cool, you were in
           the club, they'd say, "That guy's
           OK." `Cause he was in the Old
           Kinderhooks.

                          RONNIE
           Really?

                          PAT
           Yeah. Pretty cool, right?

                          RONNIE
           That's interesting.

          You know, Tiffany's been doing this
          dance thing for years and she's
          real good at it. She's gonna be

          Hotel.

                          PAT
          Oh, really? My wife loves dance.
          Nikki loves dance.

                          TIFFANY
          Why do you have to talk about me
          like that?

                          VERONICA
          I'm just bragging about you. Can't
          I brag about my little sister?

                          TIFFANY
          Don't talk about me in the third

                          VERONICA
          Just be nice. Just be nice.

                          PAT
          Wow, wow, wow. Fascinating.

                          TIFFANY
          Sorry. I don't wanna be mean.

                          VERONICA
          I know. I know, I know.

                          TIFFANY

                          (TO PAT)
          What meds are you on?

                          PAT
          Me? None. I used to be on Lithium
          and Seroquel and Abilify, but I
          don't take them anymore, no. They
          make me foggy and they also make me
          bloated.

                          TIFFANY
          Yeah, I was on Xanax and Effexor,
          but I agree, I wasn't as sharp, so
          I stopped.

           46.

                         

                          PAT
           You ever take Klonopin?

                          TIFFANY
           Klonopin? (Chuckling) Yeah.

                          PAT
           Right?

                          TIFFANY
           Jesus.

                          PAT
           It's like, "What? What day is it?"
           How about Trazodone?

                          TIFFANY
           Trazodone!

                         TIFFANY LAUGHS

                          PAT
           Oh, it flattens you out. I mean,
           you are done. It takes the light
           right out of your eyes.

                          TIFFANY
           God, I bet it does.

          VERONICA AND RONNIE FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE. TIFFANY STANDS UP.

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)
           I'm tired. I wanna go.

                          VERONICA
           No. No, no, no, no. We haven't, we
           haven't even finished the salad
           yet, or the duck. I made the Fire
           and Ice cake.

                          TIFFANY
           I said I'm tired. (to Pat) Are you
           gonna walk me home or what?

                          PAT
           You mean me?

                          TIFFANY
           Yeah, you. Are you gonna walk me
           home?

                          PAT
           You have poor social skills. You
           have a problem.

           47.

                         

                          TIFFANY
           I have a problem? You say more
           inappropriate things than
           appropriate things. You scare
           people.

                          PAT
           I tell the truth. But you're mean.

                          TIFFANY
           What? I'm not telling the truth?
          Veronica and Ronnie are very uncomfortable.

                          RONNIE
           Um, maybe I should drive them home
           separately?

                          VERONICA
           You can drive them both home. Now.

                          TIFFANY
           Stop talking about me in third
           person.

                          VERONICA
           You can take Tiffany home first.

                          TIFFANY
           You love it when I have problems.
           You love it, Von, because then you
           can be the good one. Just say it.

                          VERONICA
           No...

          PAT STANDS UP.

                          VERONICA (CONT'D)
           ...I don't. I don't. I just wanted
           to have a nice, I just wanted to
           have a nice dinner.

                          TIFFANY
           Oh, God.

                          VERONICA
           What is your problem?!

                          TIFFANY
           Nothing's my problem! I'm fine. I'm
           tired and I wanna go. (to Pat) Come
           on, are you ready?
          Pat stands.

           48.

                         

                          VERONICA
           You really, you really wanna go
           right now?

                          TIFFANY
           Yes, I really wanna go! It's been
           great.

                          RONNIE
           Okay, guys, the baby is sleeping!

                          TIFFANY
           Sorry. I don't wanna wake up the
           baby. Bye.

          PAT FOLLOWS TIFFANY.

                          RONNIE
           Sorry, man.

          PAT GIVES RONNIE AN "ALL GOOD" AND FOLLOWS TIFFANY OUT.

                         

          EXT. STREET - EVENING


          PAT AND TIFFANY WALK TOGETHER IN SILENCE.

                          TIFFANY
           This is me.

          TIFFANY AND PAT STOP, FACE EACH OTHER.

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)
           Listen, I haven't dated since
           before my marriage so I don't
           really remember how this works.

                          PAT
           How what works?

                          TIFFANY
           I saw the way you were looking at
           me, Pat. You felt it, I felt it,
           don't lie. We're not liars like
           they are. I live in the addition
           around back, which is completely
           separate from my parents' house, so
           there's no chance of them walking
           in on us. I hate the fact that you
           wore a football jersey to dinner
           because I hate football, but you
           can fuck me if you turn the lights
           off, okay?

          PAT IS MOMENTARILY SPEECHLESS.

           49.

                         

                          PAT
           How old are you?

                          TIFFANY
           Old enough to have a marriage end
           and not wind up in a mental
           hospital.

                          PAT
           Look, I had a really good time
           tonight and I think you're really
           pretty, but I'm married, okay?

          PAT HOLDS UP HIS HAND, DISPLAYING HIS WEDDING RING.

                          TIFFANY
           You're married? So am I.

          TIFFANY HOLDS UP HER HAND, DISPLAYING HER WEDDING RING.

                          PAT
           No, that's confusing. He's dead.

          TIFFANY LOOKS AS IF SHE HAS BEEN PUNCHED, SHE EMBRACES PAT.

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           Wait, what?

          TIFFANY STARTS TO CRY.

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           What's happening?

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           Oh, my God. Hey.

          TIFFANY PUSHES PAT AWAY AND SLAPS HIM ACROSS THE FACE.

          TIFFANY TURNS AND WALKS TO HER RENOVATED GARAGE APARTMENT.

          LED ZEPPELIN'S "WHAT IS AND WHAT SHALL NEVER BE" STARTS TO

          PLAY ON SOUNDTRACK.

          PAT BEELINES PAST PAT SR. TO THE STAIRCASE.

                          PAT
           When am I gonna get a phone?

           PAT SR.
           You'll get a phone in due time. (to
           Dolores) What happened?

          DOLORES ENTERS.

          PAT REMOVES HIS JERSEY.
          LED ZEPPELIN CONTINUES alternately quiet and LOUD.

          PAT LIES ON HIS BED, RESTLESS. SUDDENLY HE IS FRANTICALLY

          SEARCHING THROUGH ATTIC BOXES AS IF HIS LIFE DEPENDED ON IT.

          Led Zeppelin continues.

          PAT SR. WAKES, LOOKING AT THE ALARM CLOCK.

           PAT SR.
           It's after three o'clock! What are
           you doing?

           your sewing shit up here, for your
           sewing and everything. Did you put
           it up here?

          PAT STEPS TO AN OPEN CLOSET.

           no sense for you to put it in here.

           it, and I hate my illness and I
           want to control it. My father, on
           the other hand, had no trouble
           slapping the shit out of me last
           night, which I did not return
           `cause I could've killed him and I
           didn't. He's sixty-five years old.
           You don't think I could've beat the
           shit out of him? I mean....

           DR. PATEL
           He was scared for your mother and
           you hurt him as well.

                          PAT
           Yes, last night was a mess. Okay?
           And I think he probably just tried
           to do his best.

           DR. PATEL
           Pat, you have to have a strategy. I
           told you earlier. You need to
           recognize these feelings coming to
           you, otherwise you will be sent
           back to Baltimore. So when you get
           these feelings, you need to get to
           a quieter place, and be at peace
           with yourself, however you can.

                          PAT
           Yeah, but that's easier said than
           done.

           DR. PATEL
           You have to do it. You have no
           choice. Excelsior.

                          PAT
           Yeah, Excelsior. Listen, I have a
           letter I want you to give Nikki,
           okay?

           DR. PATEL
           No.

                          PAT
           Why?

           64.

                         

           DR. PATEL
          Because you have a restraining
          order.

                          PAT

                          (SIGHS)
          What good are you, man?

           DR. PATEL
          Why did you have this overwhelming
          urgency to see your wedding video
          last night?

                          PAT
          Oh, I don't know, because I'm
          married and I haven't seen my wife
          in eight and a half months?

           DR. PATEL
          Maybe you think that Nikki's not
          around and Tiffany's an attractive
          girl and if you get drawn towards
          Tiffany, you will spoil your
          chances of getting Nikki back to
          you?

                          PAT
          Not bad, Doctor Jones. But I don't
          think I'm gonna blow it with Nikki
          because Tiffany's a slut.

           DR. PATEL
          Why is she a slut?

                          PAT
          After the dinner at Ronnie's, she
          said, quote, "We can go to the back
          house and you can fuck me as long
          as we turn the lights out."
          Unquote. And she still wears her
          wedding ring. So she's a loyal,
          married-to-a-dead-guy slut.

           DR. PATEL
          Maybe she just needs a friend and
          she thought if she offers you sex,
          it will be easier for you to become
          friends with her.

                          PAT
          She said she's not a whore anymore,
          but she likes that part of herself
          along with all the other parts of
          herself and can I say the same?

           DR. PATEL
          Can you?

           65.

                         

                          PAT
           Is that....? You're asking me,
           you're really asking me that
           question?

           DR. PATEL
           Yes.

                          PAT
           With all my crazy sad shit? What,
           are you fucking nuts?

           DR. PATEL
           Pat, the silver lining thing is
           yours. I'm just giving back your
           words to you. This "crazy sad
           shit," as you call it, made you a
           happier, calmer person with a
           beautiful positive philosophy of
           going outdoors, working out, and
           reading books.

                          PAT
           No, not the books.

           DR. PATEL
           You said Nikki's friends with
           Ronnie, Veronica and Tiffany. So if
           you become friends with Tiffany,
           Nikki will think that you're a
           kind, generous, large-hearted
           person, who helps people in need,
           who is basically thriving. So if
           you help Tiffany, it will be good
           for you.

                          TIFFANY
           I wanted to clarify something. I
           just want us to be friends.
           (Pat doesn't answer)
           Did you hear what I said?
           (Pat doesn't answer still)
           Why are you giving me such a hard
           time?

                          PAT
           No, I'm not giving you a hard time.

          PAT AND TIFFANY RUN ACROSS THE STREET TOWARD A SMALL DINER.

                          TIFFANY

           Here you go.

                          TIFFANY
           Thank you.

          PAT LOOKS AT THE MENU. THE WAITRESS STANDS, WAITING.

                          PAT
           I'm gonna have a bowl of your
           Raisin Bran.

          TIFFANY'S PERPLEXED.

                          TIFFANY
           Tea.

          THE WAITRESS TAKES THE MENUS FROM THEM AND WALKS AWAY.

                          WAITRESS
           Be right back.

                          PAT

                          PAT
           You want to share this?

                          TIFFANY
           Why did you order Raisin Bran?

                          PAT
           Why did you order tea?

           68.

                         

          SHE EATS CEREAL.

                          TIFFANY

                          (CHEWING)
           Because you ordered Raisin Bran.

                          PAT
           I ordered Raisin Bran because I
           didn't want there to be any
           mistaking this for a date.

                          TIFFANY

                          (CHEWING)
           It can still be a date if you order
           Raisin Bran.

                          PAT
           It's not a date. So how's your
           thing going -- your dancing thing?

                          TIFFANY
           It's good. How's your restraining
           order?

                          PAT
           I wouldn't actually call the
           restraining order "my thing," but
           getting back with Nikki is, and
           I've been doing pretty well. Except
           for a minor incident at the
           doctor's office.

                          TIFFANY
           And the so-called incident with the
           weights.

                          PAT
           Yeah. That was a thing with my
           parents. I wish I could just
           explain it all in a letter to Nikki
           because it was minor and I could
           just explain it and let her know
           that I'm actually not out of
           control and that I'm actually doing
           really well.

          TIFFANY TAKES THIS IN. BEAT.

                          TIFFANY
           I can get a letter to Nikki. I see
           her sometimes with my sister.

          PAT CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT HE IS HEARING.

                          PAT
           It would be so amazing if you could
           get a letter to Nikki from me.

           69.

                         

                          TIFFANY
          I'd have to hide it from Veronica.
          She's not into breaking the law,
          which this letter would definitely
          be doing.

                          PAT
          But you would do it?

                          TIFFANY
          I'd have to be careful. I'm already
          on thin ice with my family, you
          should hear how I lost my job.

                          PAT
          How did you lose your job?

                          TIFFANY
          By...having sex with everybody in
          the office.

                          PAT
          Everybody?

                          TIFFANY
          I was very depressed after Tommy
          died. It was a lot of people.

                          PAT
          We don't have to talk about it.

                          TIFFANY
          Thanks.

                          PAT
          How many were there?

                          TIFFANY
          Eleven.

                          PAT
          Wow.

                          TIFFANY
          I know.

                          PAT
          I'm not gonna talk about it
          anymore.

                          TIFFANY
          Okay.

                          PAT
          Can I ask you one more question?
          Were there any women?

           70.

                         

                          TIFFANY
          Yes.

                          PAT
          Really?

                          TIFFANY
          Yes.

                          PAT
          What was that like?

                          TIFFANY
          Hot.

                          PAT
          Jesus Christ. Was it like...older
          women, a sexy teacher who wants to

                         SEDUCE YOU--

                          TIFFANY
          Made me sit on her lap and do
          things? Yeah.

                          PAT
          What? You sat on her lap?

                          TIFFANY
          Mm-hmm.

                          PAT
          She told you what to do?

                          TIFFANY
          Mm-hmm.

                          PAT
          Oh...my God. Nikki hated when I
          talked like this. Made me feel like
          such a pervert. Maybe we should
          change the subject.

                          TIFFANY
          I don't mind it.

                          PAT
          You don't, do you.

                          TIFFANY
          No. But then people were getting
          into fights in the parking lot at
          work, and in the bathroom...and the
          boss called me in to his office and
          tried to pin it all on me. So I
          accused him of harassment and then
          they fired me, sent me home and put
          me on some meds.

           71.

                         

                          PAT
           I get it. The song that was playing
           when my wife...was in the shower
           with the history teacher...

                          TIFFANY
           I heard about that.

                          PAT
           ...it was my wedding song and when
           I hear it, I go kinda crazy.
           Sometimes I hear it when it's not
           even playing.

                          TIFFANY
           Wow.

                          PAT
           Yeah. So they put me on medication,
           which I feel ashamed of.

                          TIFFANY
           Yeah.

                          PAT
           So I know.

                          TIFFANY
           You do.

                          PAT
           I just gotta get a strategy, you
           know?

                          TIFFANY
           Me too.

                          PAT
           We'd better get back to the letter.

                          TIFFANY
           Yeah, let's get back to the letter.

                          PAT
           What if you told Nikki when
           Veronica was in the bathroom?

                          TIFFANY
           Yes. Yes, that could work. I love
           that.

                          PAT
           Oh, my God, I'm gonna go home and
           write the letter right now.

          PAT BEGINS TO SLIDE OUT OF THE BOOTH.

           72.

                         

                          TIFFANY
          Can I at least finish my tea?

                          PAT
          Wait, what?

                          TIFFANY
          My tea. Can I finish it?

                          PAT
          Wait a minute. Did Veronica tell
          Nikki about our dinner? Why would
          she do that? Was it a test?

                          TIFFANY
          I kinda got that feeling, yeah.

                          PAT
          Goddamn it. I knew it. It was a
          test. How did I do? I think I did
          pretty well.

                          TIFFANY
          Yeah, she said you were cool,
          basically.

                          PAT
          "Basically"? Was I some percentage
          not cool?

                          TIFFANY
          No, she said you were cool, but you
          know.

                          PAT
          No, I don't know.

                          TIFFANY
          Sort of how you are. It's fine,
          relax.

                          PAT
          What do you mean? How am I? What
          does that mean?

                          TIFFANY
          Sort of like me.

                          PAT
          "Sort of like you"? I hope to God
          she didn't tell Nikki that.

                          TIFFANY
          Why?

           73.

                         

                          PAT
           Because, it's just not right,
           lumping you and I together, I mean,
           it's just wrong. And Nikki wouldn't
           like that. Especially after all the
           shit you just told me.

                          TIFFANY
           You think that I'm crazier than
           you.

                          PAT

                          (SCOFFS) (CHUCKLING)
           Because, well, we're different, I

                          MEAN--

                          TIFFANY
           Oh, my God. Ugh. You're killing me.
           You know what? Forget I offered to
           help you. Forget the entire fucking
           idea. `Cause that must have been
           fucking crazy because I am so much
           crazier than you.

                          PAT
           Keep your voice down.

                          TIFFANY
           I'm just the crazy slut with a dead
           husband!

          HALLOWEEN DINERS LOOK.

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)
           Forget it!

                          PAT
           Shut the fuck up.

          TIFFANY STANDS, SWEEPING THE DISHES OFF THE EDGE OF THE

          TABLE.

                          TIFFANY

          PAT GRABS HIS WALLET FROM THE TABLE.

          THROUGH THE WINDOW TIFFANY HOLDING UP HER MIDDLE FINGERS.

          PAT WALKS, BUT IS STOPPED BY THE WAITRESS, HOLDING UP HIS

                          WAITRESS

          TIFFANY WALKS.
          PEDESTRIANS (low and indistinct chatter - continues under
          following scenes and dialogue)

                          PAT
           Hey, come on. Look, I don't think
           you're crazy, all right?

          PAT HURRIES TO TIFFANY.

                          TIFFANY
           Yes, you do.

                          PAT
           No, I don't.

                          TIFFANY
           You told your therapist that you
           were in a superior mental illness
           category, didn't you?

                          PAT

          TIFFANY STOPPING AND TURNING TO FACE PAT.

                          TIFFANY
           Just leave me alone!

           75.

                         

                          PAT
           Can I just explain myself, please?
           I didn't want Nikki to think that I
           was associated with that kind of
           sexual behavior because I've never
           done anything like that, okay?

                          TIFFANY
           You may not have experienced the
           shit that I did. But you loved
           hearing about it, didn't you? You
           are afraid to be alive, you're
           afraid to live. You're a hypocrite.
           You're a conformist. You're a liar.
           I opened up to you and you judged
           me. You are an asshole. You are an
           asshole!

          TIFFANY GRABS PAT'S JACKET COLLAR.

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)
           Get off of me! (yelling) Get off!

           Hey, get off of me! Shut up, shut
           up.

          PEDESTRIANS CROWD AROUND, WATCHING.

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           Stop it.

          A POLICE CAR SIREN IS HEARD. A POLICE CAR AS IT PARKS.

          OFFICER KEOGH GETS OUT AND WALKS

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           Hey, hey, hey, get off me!

                          OFFICER KEOGH
           What are you doing? Come on. What
           are you doing? What are you doing
           to these kids?

          CAMERA PANS WITH OFFICER KEOGH AS HE WALKS TO PAT, GRABS HIS

          ARM.

           OFFICER KEOGH (CONT'D)
           Are you being a punk on Halloween
           with these kids? You wanna go back
           to Baltimore? Is that what you
           wanna do?

                          PAT
           I didn't, I didn't, I didn't--
          TIFFANY WATCHES IN THE CROWD OF HALLOWEEN TEENS. Softens.

                          TIFFANY
           It's the kids! [Walks to Pat and
           Officer Keogh]. He didn't do
           anything, it was all the kids.
          Officer Keogh turns to push the crowd back.

                          OFFICER KEOGH
           (walks crowd back)
           Let's go, clear out, nothing going
           on here.

          AS -- TIFFANY LEANS IN CLOSE TO PAT WHO IS UPSET, SONG
          PLAYING IN HIS HEAD. Tormented.

                          TIFFANY
           You gonna go your whole life scared
           of that song? It's just a song.
           Don't make it a monster.
          She leans close to Pat's downcast face.

           77.

                         

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)
           There's no song playing. There's
           no song. Breathe, count backwards
           from ten. That's it.
          Pat breathes, listens to her. Calms himself. Song stops.
          Tiffany's face stays close to his.

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)
           That's it. There you go. I'm sorry.
           I'm sorry.

                          PAT
           I'm sorry.

                          TIFFANY
           I took it too far.

                          PAT
           I'm sorry.

                          OFFICER KEOGH
           (pulls her away)
           Hey, is he messing with you?

                          TIFFANY
           No, no. No, this was just a joke.
           This is a joke I started.

                          OFFICER KEOGH
           There's a restraining order on this
           guy.

                          TIFFANY
           I know, I have a stupid sense of
           humor.

                          OFFICER KEOGH
           That's not a good thing to do.

                          TIFFANY
           Well, I'm fucked up. What can I
           tell you? I'm sorry.

                          OFFICER KEOGH
           You're Tommy's widow, right?

                          TIFFANY
           Yes, I'm Tommy's crazy whore widow,
           minus the whore thing for the most
           part.

                          OFFICER KEOGH
           You're a funny girl. You wanna get
           a drink sometime?

          TIFFANY TURNS AND WALKS AWAY.

           78.

                         

           OFFICER KEOGH (CONT'D)
           What'd I say?

                          PAT
           She doesn't, she doesn't do that
           anymore.

                         

          EXT. STREET - EVENING

          TIFFANY WALKS - upset, vulnerable. Pat walks behind, CATCHES

          UP TO TIFFANY AND THEY WALK TOGETHER.

                          PAT
           I'm sorry about what I said in the
           diner.

                          TIFFANY
           I know. I know you didn't mean it.

                          PAT
           I didn't mean it at all.

                          TIFFANY
           I know, you say shit you don't mean
           all the time.

                          PAT
           All the time.

                          TIFFANY
           I'll still give your letter to
           Nikki, don't worry.
          TIFFANY WALKS THE DRIVEWAY TOWARD HER GARAGE. Pat watches her
          go.

                          PAT
           Wow. I really appreciate that,
           Tiffany.

                          TIFFANY

                          (WALKING AWAY)
           I know you do.

                          PAT
           You do?

                          TIFFANY

                          (DISHEARTENED)
           Yeah, sure.

                          PAT
           I'll see you tomorrow? With the
           letter?

          TABLE.

                          RANDY
           I'll bet I know what happened if
           only one is missing. Either Dolores
           or Pat needed an envelope and one
           of `em took it. That's the only
           answer.

           PAT SR.
           No, no, no.

          DOLORES, PREPARING FOOD IN THE KITCHEN.

           PAT SR. (CONT'D)
           Dolores, somebody was in my study.
           Who took one of my envelopes?
           Somebody took an envelope.

                          DOLORES
           Maybe we should call the FBI.

           PAT SR.
           Don't make fun. This is serious.
           What FBI? Come on, let's take a
           look. I'll show you what this is.
           I'm gonna just explain to you
           something. I mean, you know what
           I'm doing, honey. This everything,
           like this. I got this, it all
           corresponds.

          PAT ENTERS.

                          PAT
           Dad, I borrowed one of your
           envelopes. I hope that's not a

                          PROBLEM

           PAT SR.
           No, it's not okay. It's not okay.
           You gotta ask.

                          DOLORES
           "Do not go in my study or I will
           eat you!"

                         RANDY LAUGHS

           PAT SR.
           It's not funny, it's not funny.
           What's everybody making a joke out
           of this for?

           80.

          Dolores, you are so beautiful!

           PAT SR.

                          (TO RANDY)
          Stop that! Hey, hey, hey, stop,
          stop, stop!

                          (TO PAT)
          Listen, a lot of envelopes go in
          and out of my office every day
          after games with a lot of cash in
          `em. So show some respect for what
          I do.

                          PAT
          Yeah, I know. I saw two-seven-four.
          I just wanted to tell you the
          number.

          But the envelope was empty. I'm
          sorry, you were sleeping. I didn't
          want to wake you, but I needed an
          envelope.

           PAT SR.
          You didn't want to wake me? (to
          Dolores and Randy) He didn't want
          to wake me. He doesn't have a
          problem complaining about Ernest
          fucking Hemingway. He doesn't have
          a problem asking for his wedding

          You're just up, up, up. I don't

                          PAT
          Am I taking the right dose? Of
          course I am.

           PAT SR.
          Okay. Taking a little bit too many
          or something?

          No, if I was taking that, I'd be on

           I know.

           That was the set-up.

                          TIFFANY
           Because I do this time after time
           after time, I do all this shit for
           other people and then I wake up

                          TIFFANY
           I always get myself in these

           nobody ever, I never -- I don't get
           what I want, okay? I'm not my

           It's a thing, it's a thing. It's a,
           it's a dance thing.

                          PAT
           It's a dance thing, all right.

                          TIFFANY
           It's a competition thing at the
           Benjamin Franklin Hotel. Tommy
           would never do it with me and I
           missed it every single year.

           Would you please!

                          PAT
           I don't have a filter when I talk.

                          TIFFANY
           Can we have one conversation
           without you reminding me that my
           goddamn husband is dead? My God.

                          PAT
           Yes, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay,
           I'm sorry.

                          TIFFANY
           But I can only do it if I have a
           partner...and now I'm about to miss
           it for another year.

           What, your schedule is so busy?
           "Grapes of Wrath" and watching
           football with your dad?

                          PAT
           Tiffany, I'm not gonna do a dance
           with you.

           All right, then I'm not giving her
           your fucking letter.

          TIFFANY WALKS AWAY.

                          PAT
           Wait a second! But you promised you

                          TIFFANY
           Think about it.

          TIFFANY TURNS AND WALKS.

                          PAT
           Well, I already did do something
           for you, you know.

          TIFFANY TURNS.

                          TIFFANY

           WHAT DID YOU DO FOR ME?

                          PAT
           I took care of that jerkoff that
           was in front of your house.

                          TIFFANY
           What? Jordie?

                          PAT
           Let me ask you something. Do you
           call him when you're lonely?

          TIFFANY STOPS.

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           That encourages him, Tiffany. You
           shouldn't do it.

                          TIFFANY
           Couldn't you say the same about you
           and Nikki?

           88.

                         

                          PAT
           It's not at all like me and Nikki.
           What are you talking about? We're
           in love and we're married. It's
           completely different.

                          TIFFANY
           How are you in love? Tell me about
           that. The big Nikki love. Tell me
           about it, I wanna understand it.

                          PAT
           We have a very unconventional
           chemistry, it makes people feel
           awkward, but not me. She's the most
           beautiful woman I've ever been
           with.

                          TIFFANY
           Wow.

                          PAT
           It's electric between us, okay?
           Yeah, we wanna change each other,
           but that's normal, couples wanna do
           that, I want her to stop dressing
           like she dresses, I want her to
           stop acting so superior to me,
           okay? And she wanted me to lose
           weight and stop my mood swings,
           both of which I've done. I mean,
           people fight. Couples fight. We
           would fight, we wouldn't talk for a
           couple weeks. That's normal. She
           always wanted the best for me.
          Tiffany listens.

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           She wanted me to be passionate and
           compassionate. And that's a good
           thing. You know? I just, look, I'm
           my best self today, and I think
           she's her best self today, and our
           love's gonna be fucking amazing.

                          TIFFANY

           for dancers.

                          PAT
           Wow.

                          TIFFANY
           I'm not that great of a dancer, but
           who cares? It's therapy and it's
           fun. And the walls are good `cause
           I can play music really loud
           without anybody hearing.

                          PAT
           Where do you sleep?

          TIFFANY GESTURES AT A STAIRCASE.

                          TIFFANY
           Upstairs. It's a garage, I just
           renovated it. You know, I was
           thinking about putting a ballet
           barre here.

                          PAT
           When are you gonna give it to her?

                          TIFFANY
           What?

                          PAT
           The letter to Nikki.

          PAT HOLDS UP THE ENVELOPE.

                          TIFFANY
           Probably tonight.

                          PAT
           Really?

           98.

                         

                          TIFFANY
           Ronnie and Veronica and I are gonna
           see her tonight.

                          PAT
           Oh, I actually changed the first
           paragraph. I did this thing about
           Shakespeare and how it's very

                          ROMANTIC-

                          TIFFANY
           Mm-hmm.

                          PAT
           -and that maybe in the future if
           she wanted to go dancing, I can be
           able to do that because of all the

                          TRAINING THAT--

                          TIFFANY

                          (INTERRUPTING)
           No, that's good, that's really
           good.

                          PAT
           I assume you're a good teacher.

          TIFFANY'S HAND TAKES THE ENVELOPE FROM PAT.

                          TIFFANY
           Yeah. I mean, I hope so.

                          PAT
           Maybe you can teach us both, you
           know what I mean?

          TIFFANY EXITS AND PLACES THE ENVELOPE ON THE STAIRCASE.

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           And I also mentioned how generous
           it is, what I'm doing for you.

                          TIFFANY
           Yeah. Mm-hmm. It's really generous.

                          PAT
           You know, being of service.

                          TIFFANY
           Yeah.

                          PAT
           To your need.

                          TIFFANY
           Uh-huh.

           99.

                         

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)
           All right, let's start simple.
           Start at that corner, walk towards
           me. Walk across the room.
          Pat stands in the corner, doesn't move.

                          PAT
           Can we do something else besides
           the dance deal?

                          TIFFANY
           Are you fucking kidding me?

                          PAT
           I'm good with a hammer. You want me
           to fix something?

                          TIFFANY
           A deal is a deal.

                          PAT
           I know. Okay. I was just suggesting
           that maybe there's a better
           scenario.

                          TIFFANY
           Why don't you walk towards me like
           I'm Nikki. And the only way to
           convey how much you've missed me is
           by your walk. By your slow walk.
           You can't talk.

                          PAT
           I'm not doing it.

                          TIFFANY
           Only walk. Do it.

                          PAT
           No. That's stupid.

                          TIFFANY
           No walk, no letter. Walk to me like
           I'm Nikki, come on. Do it. I'm
           Nikki. Come on.

                          PAT
           (under his breath)
           You're not Nikki.

          PAT RELUCTANTLY WALKS.

                          TIFFANY
           Don't look up until you're halfway
           here.

           100.

                         

          PAT WALKS SLOWLY. CAMERA TILTS UP ONTO HIS FACE AS HE KEEPS

          HIS HEAD DOWN.

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)
           That's right.

          PAT WALKS TO HER.

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)
           Not yet.

          PAT AS HE STOPS FACE TO FACE WITH TIFFANY AND LOOKS HER IN

          THE EYES.

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)
           Yes. Do you feel that? That's
           emotion.

                          PAT
           I don't feel anything.

                          TIFFANY
           Has anybody ever told you how Tommy
           died?

                          PAT
           No.

                          TIFFANY
           We were married for three years and
           five days, and I loved him. But for
           the last couple months, I just
           wasn't into sex at all. It just
           felt like we were so different and
           I was depressed. Some of that is
           just me, some of it was he wanted
           me to have kids and I have a hard
           enough time taking care of myself.
           I don't think that makes me a
           criminal. Anyway one night after
           dinner, he drove to Victoria's
           Secret at King of Prussia Mall and
           got some lingerie to get something
           going. And on the way back, he
           stopped on 76 to help a guy with a
           flat tire and he got hit by a car
           and killed. And the Victoria's
           Secret box was still in the front
           seat. (pause) That's a feeling.

          PAT, VISIBLY UPSET, WATCHES AS TIFFANY TURNS TO HER IPOD. BOB

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)
           Okay, this is the waltz. I'm gonna
           teach you the waltz step.

          TIFFANY POSITIONS PAT AND GESTURES FOR HIM TO DANCE. HE MOVES
          AROUND HER as she showed him, his hands on his shoulders.

           Football stays out of this place,
           so does "Lord of the Flies."

                          PAT
           Wait, wait, no, no, no, what are
           you doing? I'm behind on my
           syllabus.

                          TIFFANY
           I don't give a fuck.

          INT. TIFFANY'S GARAGE/DANCE STUDIO - DAY


                          PAT
           Did you just throw that outside?

                          TIFFANY
           What? You're not gonna read that
           shit on my time. I can tell you all
           about the "Lord of the Flies." It's
           a bunch of boys on an island and
           they have a conch -- they have a
           shell -- and whoever has the conch
           has the power and they can talk.
           And if you don't have the conch,
           then you don't have the power. And
           then there's a little chubby boy,
           and they call him Piggy and they're
           really mean, and then there's a
           murder. I mean, humanity is just
           nasty and there's no silver lining.

                          PAT
           Wow. That was a great synopsis. I
           still need to read it, though.

          A KNOCK AT THE DOOR.

                          PAT (CONT'D)

           What the....? (laughing) What are
           you doing here, man?

          DANNY WALKS INTO THE ROOM.

                          DANNY
           If one of your two supervising
           physicians loses their license,
           then your whole ajudication is
           thrown out.

                          PAT
           How'd you know we were here?

                          DANNY
           I went by your parents' house
           looking for you and they told me
           you was over here.

                          PAT
           Danny, this is Tiffany. (to
           Tiffany) Tiffany, this is Danny.

                          TIFFANY
           Hello. Pat told me about you.

                          DANNY
           So is the girl, that you wrote
           about?

                          PAT
           Yeah.

                          TIFFANY
           What? He wrote about me? I'm "the
           girl"?

                          DANNY
           He wrote about you, all right.

                          TIFFANY
           What'd he say?

                          DANNY
           He said you guys was helping each
           other out and you were nice and had
           a mouth on you, that you were
           mouthy, but--

                          PAT
           Whoa, whoa, that's enough.

                          TIFFANY
           No, please, tell me more about what
           he said in the letter.

           105.

                         

                          PAT
           Yeah, anything you wanna know, I'll
           just tell you. It was nothing. It
           was just a very general letter.

                          TIFFANY
           Cool.

                          DANNY
           (looks at Tiffany)
           She's fine.

                          PAT
           She is my friend with an "F."

                          DANNY
           A capital "F."

                          PAT
           For "friend."
          The three stand there awkwardly for a beat.

                          DANNY
           Hey, can I see what you guys are
           doing?

                          PAT
           Yeah.

                          TIFFANY
           Okay.

          SHE TURNS ON MUSIC: PAT AND TIFFANY DANCE SIDE BY SIDE.

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)
           And then this goes into something
           else.

                          DANNY
           That's it?

                          PAT
           Why? What is it, what is it, what
           is it.

                          DANNY
           Can I say something? Do you mind?

                          TIFFANY
           No.

                          DANNY
           You sure?

                          PAT
           Just say it. Say it.

           106.

                         

                          TIFFANY
           No, please.

                          DANNY
           I think Pat, you should be facing
           Tiffany.

          DANNY STEPS TO PAT AND TIFFANY, REMOVING HIS JACKET.

                          DANNY (CONT'D)
           Let me show you, Pat, let me show
           you what I mean. You gotta come at
           her with a little bit more soul,
           man.

          HE HANDS HIS JACKET TO PAT AND FACES TIFFANY.

                          DANNY (CONT'D)

                          (TO TIFFANY)
           You should move more hips.

          TIFFANY AND DANNY. PAT WATCHES, STANDING BEHIND DANNY.

                          DANNY (CONT'D)

                          (TO PAT)
           Just, just sort of come in, Pat,
           come in like this. And....

          DANNY DANCES, DEMONSTRATING.

                          PAT
           Okay.

                          DANNY
           Yeah. Can you move `em a little bit
           more? Yeah, that's it. Move `em a
           bit more.

          PAST DANNY, TO TIFFANY AS SHE DANCES. TIFFANY CHUCKLES

                          DANNY (CONT'D)
           You could turn around, too, there's
           nothing wrong with that. Yeah.
           You're pretty good.

          TIFFANY, DANNY AND PAT AS THEY DANCE. ONE HAND ON HER WAIST.

                          DANNY (CONT'D)

                          (HUMS)
           Mm, yeah.

          PAT ENTERS, STEPPING BETWEEN DANNY AND TIFFANY.

                          PAT
           Okay, we got it, we got it.

           107.

                         

                          DANNY
           Okay. Okay.

          DANNY MOVES, EXITING. AS PAT AND TIFFANY DANCE.

                          DANNY (CONT'D)
           Come on, Pat, come on. A little bit
           more soul. Black it up, Pat.

                          PAT
           "Black it up"?

                          DANNY
           You know damn well what it means.

          TIFFANY LAUGHS.

                          DANNY (CONT'D)
           Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute,
           wait a minute. Oh, man! I got an
           idea.

          CAMERA MOVES IN ON DANNY. CAMERA TILTS UP OVER DANNY AND

          TIFFANY AS THEY JUMP UP REPEATEDLY, HOLDING HANDS AND MOVING

          IN A CIRCLE.

          PAT WATCHES AS DANNY AND TIFFANY JUMP TOGETHER.

                          DANNY (CONT'D)
           Come get some, Pat. Come get some.

          PAT BEGINS JUMPING WITH TIFFANY. CUT TO: DANNY WITH TIFFANY

          AGAIN.

                          DANNY (CONT'D)
           Shuffle back, shuffle back. Shuffle
           back, shuffle back. Girl, you gotta
           move your junk.

          TIFFANY'S HIPS AS SHE DANCES. DANNY DANCES WITH HER. MUSIC

          STOPS.

                          DANNY (CONT'D)
           I gotta get out of here. I gotta go
           see this girl, Tanya. She lives on
           this side of town.

                          PAT
           Yeah, go see Tanya. Good idea.

                          DANNY
           Okay, man, hey. I'm gonna be there,
           man. I want you guys to win!

                          TIFFANY
           Bye!

           108.

                         

                          DANNY
           Excelsior, Pat!

                          PAT
           Excelsior!

                          DANNY
           That's my man.

          DANNY EXITS.

          TIFFANY AND PAT SMILE.

                         

          INT. SOLATANO HOUSE/ATTIC - MORNING


          PAT, ASLEEP IN BED.

          PAT SR. WALKS INTO THE ATTIC. HE SITS DOWN ON THE BED NEXT TO

          PAT.

          PAT SR. TOUCHES PAT'S SHOULDER.

           PAT SR.
           Hey. Patty.

          PAT WAKES.

           PAT SR. (CONT'D)
           Pat.

           PAT SR. (CONT'D)
           Patty. Where have you been? Huh?

          PAT GROANS.

           PAT SR. (CONT'D)
           We got a serious situation on our
           hands, you know that.
          Pat looks concerned, he could be in trouble.

           PAT SR. (CONT'D)
           We gotta beat the Giants if we
           wanna have a chance of getting into
           the division, any chance of playing
           in the playoffs. Do you realize
           that?

                          PAT
           I didn't realize that.

           109.

                         

           PAT SR.
           Yeah, that's the bind we're in. I
           mean, I think it would be wise if
           we spent father-son time, reading
           about the Eagles, talking about
           them, just to strengthen the good
           luck thing that you're in.

                          PAT
           Okay.

           PAT SR.
           Yeah?

                          PAT
           Right.

           PAT SR.
           Hmm?

          PAT SR. LOOKS AWAY.

           PAT SR. (CONT'D)
           I just wanted to, maybe I didn't,
           spend enough time with you growing
           up. I spent too much time with your
           brother. It might have made you
           feel worse about your behavior, but
           I didn't know anything, I didn't
           know how to handle it. I mean,
           that's what all this Eagles stuff
           is about. It's about us, spending
           time now. I wanna do everything I
           can to help you get back on your
           feet. That's the whole point. Yeah.
           I wish you'd watch these games with
           me so we could talk, we could get
           into things. (inhales) So would
           you, would you just come downstairs
           and talk to me and Randy now?

          PAT SR. TOUCHES PAT'S CHEEK. PAT, MOVED, NODS.

                         

          INT. SOLATANO HOUSE/KITCHEN - MORNING


          RANDY SITS AT THE TABLE, DRINKING COFFEE.

           PAT SR.
           Randy, tell him what I'm doing.

                          RANDY
           He's betting everything on the
           Giant game. Everything.

           110.

                         

                          RANDY (CONT'D)
           All the money that he needs for the
           restaurant, he's betting on the
           Giant game.

           PAT SR.
           Tell him why.

                          RANDY
           Because he believes in you.

                          PAT
           Is that true?

           PAT SR.
           I believe in you, Patty. I believe
           in you. I want you to know that. So
           I'm gonna bet heavy on this game.

          DOLORES STARES INTENSELY AT PAT.

           PAT SR. (CONT'D)
           You understand?

                          PAT
           Yeah.

           PAT SR.
           Heavy. I want you to go to the game
           with your brother.

                          PAT
           You want me to go to the game with
           Jake?

           PAT SR.
           Of course I do.

                          JAKE
           Does he want me to go?

           PAT SR.
           Of course he wants you to go.

                          PAT
           He told you that?

           PAT SR.
           He told me, yes.

                          PAT
           Even with all his friends?

           PAT SR.
           With all his friends. He trusts
           you.

           111.

                         

                          PAT
           He's not embarrassed?

           PAT SR.
           No. I'd love to go to the game,
           too, but as you know, I'm banned
           from the stadium. `Cause I'd love
           to see us beat the Giants and take
           a lot of money from this asshole.

                          RANDY
           Listen, personally, I think it's a
           stupid bet. As a matter of fact, I
           think it's ridiculous to bet all
           that dough for the restaurant on a
           game.

           PAT SR.
           Randy. (to Pat) I just hope you
           heard what I said. It's like a
           family business, it's our family
           endeavor. We all stick together on
           this. That's how it works. That's a
           positive, positive vibe.

                          PAT
           I made a commitment to Tiffany
           about a project, and we have a very
           important part of it that we have
           to go over on Sunday, and it's good
           for me, Dad. It's making me
           disciplined and focused, and it's,
           it's--, I never would've thought
           this, but it's a good thing.

           PAT SR.
           What is this thing you're doing?

                          DOLORES
           Yeah, what is it? What is this
           project, hon?

                          PAT
           It's a dance thing, okay? There's
           nothing more to it, Dad. I swear.

          DOLORES STEPS TO PAT, KISSES HIS FOREHEAD.

                         

          INT. TIFFANY'S GARAGE/DANCE STUDIO - DAY


          TIFFANY AND PAT.

                          PAT
           Listen, I need to ask you
           something.

                          (MORE)

           112.

                         

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           Tomorrow can I spend half the day
           with you and half the day at the
           Eagles game?

                          TIFFANY
           I'm gonna pretend that you didn't
           just ask me that.

                          PAT
           Why?

                          TIFFANY
           These are the two days that you
           have promised me and that we have
           prepared to nail the big move. It's
           not ready yet. And we don't have a
           move yet.

                          PAT
           I know, but my dad opened up to me
           and it was really beautiful and I
           wanna be of service to him, okay?
           And he's worried that the juju from
           the Eagles is being fucked up and
           he's concerned that it's because
           I'm spending time with you.

                          TIFFANY
           Oh, I messed up the Eagles' juju?

                          PAT
           No, you're not messing up the juju,
           but the juju is messed up because
           I'm not with him during the games.

                          TIFFANY
           Guess what?

                          PAT
           What?

                          TIFFANY
           Nikki replied to your letter.

          TIFFANY STEPS TO THE STAIRCASE, LIFTING AN ENVELOPE.

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)

                          (INTERRUPTING)
           But you can't read it until after
           you nail the big move. Go.

          PAT SIGHS AS SHE TURNS SHARPLY, PLACES THE ENVELOPE ON THE

          STAIRCASE AGAIN. CUT TO:

          PAT BRACES HIMSELF AT FAR SIDE OF STUDIO TO CATCH TIFFANY'S

          BIG LEAP -- TIFFANY BRACES HERSELF TO RUN -- SHE RUNS --

          LEAPS -- THE FALL. THEY DO IT AGAIN, SAME RESULTS.

           113.

                         

                          PAT
           Tiff, I'm sorry. I can't do
           anything else without reading
           Nikki's letter, okay? It's just--,
           it's in the back of my head. We
           don't almost have it, all right?

                          TIFFANY
           I just hope you can handle it.

                          PAT
           Thank you.

          TIFFANY PICKS UP THE ENVELOPE AND TURNS.

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           What was her energy when she gave
           it to you?

                          TIFFANY
           She was intrigued, excited, and a
           little scared.

                          PAT
           She was scared? About what? Did she
           tell you?

          PAT TAKES THE ENVELOPE.

          CAMERA TILTS DOWN ONTO HIS HANDS, OPENING THE ENVELOPE.

                          TIFFANY
           Try to stay positive.

          PAT'S HANDS UNFOLD THE TYPED LETTER.

                          PAT
           I'm just gonna read it out loud,
           okay? Because if she says anything
           that's, you know, is that too much
           to ask?

                          TIFFANY
           No.

          PAT LOOKS DOWN AT THE LETTER, READING SILENTLY.

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)
           I thought you were gonna read it
           out loud.

                          PAT
           Okay. Sorry.

                          (READING)

                          (MORE)

           114.

                         

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           "Dear Pat, It was very emotional
           for me to get your letter, as I'm
           sure you can imagine, but I'm glad
           you took the risk of discreetly
           getting it to me through Tiffany.
           This gives us a chance to
           communicate while I keep the
           restraining order until I feel
           safe. I must admit you sound
           terrific and I'm happy that you are
           feeling so positive and becoming a
           more loving and caring man, which I
           always knew you were. I was moved
           to read about `Excelsior' and your
           belief in happy endings. I am also
           moved by your act of love to read
           the books I have taught at the high
           school. I'm sorry you find them so
           negative, but I disagree. I think
           they are great works of art that
           reflect how hard life can be and
           they can also help kids prepare
           themselves for the hardness of
           life. In spite of all these
           positive developments, Pat, I have
           to say if it's me reading the
           signs, I need to see something to
           prove you are ready to resume our
           marriage. Otherwise I find myself
           thinking that we might both be
           better off moving on with our lives
           separately. Please don't react
           quickly to this, but take time to
           think about it. I'm glad you're
           doing so well. Love, Nikki."
          PAT FOLDS UP THE LETTER AGAIN. He is kind of crying.

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           I think I'm done for today, okay?

                          TIFFANY
           (follows him to door)
           She said to show her something,
           Pat. This dance can be that
           something. You would have never
           done something like this in a
           million years. It shows all kinds
           of skills on so many different
           levels: focus, collaboration,
           discipline. It's romantic, like I
           said it would be. It's for her.

                          PAT
           (over his shoulder)
           Thanks for the letter. I'll see you
           tomorrow, okay?

           Well, I'm just doing this project
           with Tiffany and I wanted to tell

           that crazy girl, you know?

           She's not crazy -- I'll just borrow
           Jake's phone. It's too bad you
           can't come in to the stadium, but I
           know you were kicked out, you know,
           for beating everybody up. Guess
           we're not that different, huh, Dad?

           PAT SR.
           That a bad thing?

                          PAT

          commitment to me in return for my
          help. I'm Tiffany, by the way.

           PAT SR.
          What is this craziness with Tiffany
          Maxwell?

                          PAT
          There's no craziness. I told you
          who she was, I was doing this thing
          with her. We had a conversation!

           PAT SR.
          She's fucking nuts! When you
          started spending time with her, it
          all fell apart. This is the fucking
          reason right here.

                          TIFFANY
          You think I fucked up the Eagles'
          juju, don't you?

           PAT SR.
          Ever since, ever since he was with
          you, ever since--

                          TIFFANY

                          (INTERRUPTING)
          You think that I'm why today's
          happened?

           PAT SR.
          That's right, you are why today
          happened.

                          TIFFANY
          I'm the reason why today happened?

           PAT SR.
          I think so.

                          TIFFANY
          Let's talk about that.

           124.

                         

           PAT SR.
          Be my guest.

                          TIFFANY
          The first night that Pat and I met
          at my sister's, the Eagles beat the
          Forty Niners handily, forty to
          twenty-six. The second time we got
          together we went for a run and the
          Phillies beat the Dodgers seven to
          five in the NLCS.

                          JAKE
          She's right, Dad.

                          TIFFANY
          The next time we went for a run the
          Eagles beat the Falcons, twenty-
          seven to fourteen.

                          PAT
          Wow.

                          TIFFANY
          The third time we got together we
          had Raisin Bran in the diner and
          the Phillies dominated Tampa Bay in
          the fourth game of the World
          Series, ten to two.

                          PAT
          Oh, wow.

           PAT SR.
          Let me think about that. Wait a
          minute.

                          TIFFANY
          Well, why don't you think about
          when the Eagles beat the Seahawks,
          fourteen to seven.

           PAT SR.
          He was with you?

                          TIFFANY
          He was with me. We went for a run.

                          RONNIE
          Really? That's crazy.

           125.

                         

                          TIFFANY
           There have been no games since Pat
           and I have been rehearsing every
           day and if Pat had been with me
           like he was supposed to, he
           wouldn't have gotten in a fight, he
           wouldn't be in trouble, maybe the
           Eagles beat the New York Giants.

                          JAKE
           She's making a lot of sense, Pop.
           That's all right on all counts.

                          TIFFANY
           Does anybody here happen to know
           what the official motto of the
           state of New York is on the
           official seal of the State of New
           York? Huh? Anybody? (to Pat Sr.) Do
           you? Do you know? "Excelsior." Look
           it up. Yeah, "Excelsior."

                          DOLORES
           Oh Pat.

                          TIFFANY
           Not that I give a fuck about
           football or about your
           superstitions, but if it's me
           reading the signs, I don't send the
           Eagles guy whose personal motto is
           "Excelsior," to a fucking Giants
           game, especially when he's already
           in a legal situation.

                          RONNIE
           Unbelievable.

                          PAT
           Wow. How did you know all that
           stuff?

                          TIFFANY
           I did my research.

          SHE SNAPS OFF A BEER BOTTLE CAP AND DRINKS.

           PAT SR.
           Well, I gotta say, I'm impressed.

                          TIFFANY
           Thank you.

           PAT SR.
           I gotta rethink this whole thing. I
           didn't trust it before, but I gotta
           say, now I do.

           126.

                         

                          PAT
          Oh, now you like her, Dad?

           PAT SR.
          I have to say I do. Yup.

                          RANDY
          Patrizio, I feel terrible, you
          know? You made the bet, I won a lot
          of money, and now look, your whole
          family is in turmoil.

                          TIFFANY
          Oh, fuck off, Randy. You love it.
          You live for this shit. You've been
          betting against my father for
          years.

                          PAT
          Is that right?

                          TIFFANY
          You're twisting the knife right
          now. You get off on it!

                          RANDY
          That's bullshit! That's not true!
          Don't say that!

                          TIFFANY
          You get off on it! If not, then
          prove it. Prove it.

           PAT SR.
          Yeah, prove it, prove it!

                          RANDY
          How do you want me to prove it?

           PAT SR.
          How's he gonna prove it?

                          TIFFANY
          By giving them the chance to win
          back everything, double or nothing.

                          PAT
          No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

                          RANDY
          Double or nothing on the Bengals,
          next week? Is that what you're
          saying?

                          TIFFANY
          No.

           127.

                         
          She pauses, turns dramatically to Randy.

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)
           Against the Cowboys.

          EVERYONE GASPS.

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)
           That's your team isn't it, Randy?

                          PAT
           That's his team!

                          TIFFANY
           I know who his team is.

                          RANDY
           When is the game?

                          TIFFANY
           December twenty-eight, last game of
           the season.

                          PAT
           Oh, my God.

                          TIFFANY
           Same day as the Benjamin Franklin
           Pairs Open Freestyle Dance
           Competition.

                          DOLORES
           Oh God.

           PAT SR.
           Randy, I thought they were
           America's Team. Don't you believe
           in America's Team?

                          TIFFANY
           Yeah, Randy, don't you believe in
           America's Team?

                          RANDY
           Yeah, I believe in America's Team
           but if I win that bet, I win your
           book, you're out of action, you get
           no restaurant, no nothing.

           PAT SR.
           I like it.

                          DOLORES
           No. No, Patrizio--

           128.

                         

           PAT SR.
          I believe in the Eagles, I believe
          in my son, I'll take the action.
          I'll take it.

                          PAT
          Dad!

                          DOLORES
          Patrizio, don't! It's toxic!

           PAT SR.
          I have faith, I have faith.
          Excelsior belongs in this house--

                          PAT

                         DAD--

           PAT SR.
          --not in the State of New York. In
          this house.

                          PAT
          Dad, listen to me. I didn't know
          that "Excelsior" was the state
          motto of New York, okay?

           PAT SR.
          I didn't know, either, but now I
          know.

                          PAT
          I know, but listen to me, this is
          toxic. Dad, Dad, Dad, this is
          toxic, you shouldn't be doing this,
          you shouldn't be doing--

           PAT SR.
          Randy, what do you say-- (to Pat)
          Be quiet, shut up. You already did
          enough. (to Randy) Randy, what do
          you say? My birds, Benjamin
          Franklin's team favored by one and
          a half points. I'll give you three
          more.

                          DOLORES
          Patrizio, stop it! And Randy, don't
          you take the bet!

           PAT SR.
          In fact, I'll give you ten points.

                          PAT
          No, Dad! Dad!

           129.

                         

                          JAKE
          Dad!

           PAT SR.
          You have to take that bet on the
          Cowboys.

                          RANDY
          Dolores, would you stop him?

                          JAKE
          Jesus!

           PAT SR.
          How could you not take that bet?
          Even with the ten points I give
          you, that's an insane spread to
          your advantage. Cowboys are
          cowards. And I'll bet you're such a
          coward, you won't take the ten.
          Plus, are you listening, plus
          whatever their score is at the
          dance thing. (to Tiffany) What's
          that? Tiffany, what's that?

                          PAT
          What? No, no, no, no.

                          RANDY
          You're crazy to give away that many
          points. That's ridiculous! I won't
          take that! However, wait a second.
          I do like the idea of a parlay.

                          DOLORES
          What? No parlay! No!

                          PAT
          No, don't do it. Don't do it.

                          RANDY
          Pat, how do they run this dance
          competition? I mean, how do they
          score it and everything?

                          PAT
          I don't know, I don't know how they
          fucking score! We're participating.
          We're not, we're not a part of it.
          There are people, this is a high-
          end dance contest. I don't know. Do
          not put it as part of the parlay,
          Randy. Don't--

           130.

                         

                          TIFFANY
           They go by the Philadelphia rules.
           Each dancer is scored on a scale of
           one to ten, ten being the highest.
           You have to average the four
           judges' scores.

                          RANDY
           Okay, score is from one to ten,
           right? And you guys are how good?

                          PAT
           We suck.

                          TIFFANY
           We don't suck. Pat's a beginner,
           I'm okay, we're happy just to be
           going there.

                          RANDY
           And how are the people you're
           competing against?

                          TIFFANY
           They're good. Some of them are
           professionals.

                          RANDY
           They're good? Better than you?
          Pause. Tiffany says nothing.

                          PAT
           A lot better.

                          RANDY
           A lot better. So if I was to say
           you only have to score five, I
           would be really very generous,
           right?

                          PAT
           No, no, that would be amazing if we
           got five. Let's not get away--

                          TIFFANY
           Oh, come on, we can get a five out
           of ten! Gimme a break! Gimme me a
           break!

                          PAT
           We can't get five!

           PAT SR.
           Give `em a five. Give `em a five.

           131.

                         

                          TIFFANY
          We can do a five.

                          PAT
          What are you talking about, Dad?
          You haven't even seen us dance!

                          RANDY
          That's the parlay.

           DR. PATEL
          Will somebody please explain to me
          the parlay? Please?

                          RONNIE
          You gotta win two bets or you lose
          the whole thing. For Pat Sr. to
          win, the birds gotta beat the
          Cowboys plus Pat and Tiffany gotta
          get at least a five at the dance.

           DR. PATEL
          That's very, very manic indeed.

                          RONNIE
          That's the parlay.

                          RANDY
          Shake on it.

                          PAT
          You know what? I'm not gonna be a
          part of this. (to Randy) Randy,
          Randy, you're a sickness. You're a
          fucking sickness, Randy. I'm out.

                          TIFFANY
          Pat, you can't quit.

                          PAT
          I'm not doing the dance. I'm out.

                          TIFFANY
          Pat, calm down. Thank about it.

                          PAT
          See you later.

                          TIFFANY
          Pat, no.

           PAT SR.
          What are you doing?

                          TIFFANY
          Pat.

           it was very constructive for him,
           and you ruined it.

           There's only one way to get him to

           a little lie.

                          TIFFANY
           There's no other way.

           PAT SR.
           You know, we gotta leave a trail of
           bread crumbs so that he can live
           his life without ruining it.

                          DOLORES
           No. I don't approve. You can't do
           it.

           PAT SR.
           Well, you know, I didn't approve
           when you called her and you told
           her where he was running, so she
           could ambush him. I didn't approve
           of that, but you did it anyway, so
           I'm doing this anyway. That's it.

                          TIFFANY
           We're gonna tell him Nikki'll be
           there.

           "...I know you wrote the letter.

           "...was by doing something crazy
           yourself. Thank you. I love you. I
           knew it the minute I met you. I'm
           sorry it took so long for me to
           catch up. I just got stuck. Pat." I
           wrote that a week ago.

                          TIFFANY
           You wrote that a week ago?

                          PAT
           Yes, I did.

                          TIFFANY
           You let me lie to you for a week?

                          PAT
           I was trying to be romantic.

                          TIFFANY
           You love me?

                          PAT
           Yeah, I do.

                          TIFFANY
           Okay.
          SHE LEANS FORWARD AND KISSES HIM, they kiss. Camera pulls
          away. Score comes in.

           PAT SR.
           We have to beat the Vikings by
           three. I'm givin' you a six, which
           is very generous after the beating
           you just took. So what are we
           doin', what are we talkin' about
           here?

          PAT SR. TURNS TO RANDY.

                          RANDY
           I'd like to do another parlay if we
           make it to the next round, that's
           all.

           PAT SR.
           But we are gonna make it to the
           next round. We're gonna beat...

          DOLORES PREPARES BRACIOLE WITH DANNY.

                          DANNY
           So you put the bread crumbs, the
           garlic in the steak and you roll it
           up with the toothpicks?

                          DOLORES
           Yeah. For, oh, maybe three hours,
           plus.

           PAT SR.

                          (INTO TELEPHONE)
           Everything's good, everything's
           good, yeah. I got you, you're all
           down. (pause) No, Randy, he's
           complaining. You know he lost a lot
           of money. He's moaning and
           groaning. The restaurant's
           happening because of Randy, so
           everything's good.
          TIFFANY SITS DOWN ON PAT'S LAP AND THEY TALK (we cannot hear
          them) and KISS.
