Seventh Victim, The (1943) movie scriptby Charles O'Neal and DeWitt Bodeen.
More info about this movie on IMDb.com


The RKO TITLE and CREDITS are SUPERIMPOSED over a tall
stained glass window as shown from the inside of a building.
There are two maidenly figures worked into the stained glass
window: one, older and slightly taller, dressed in van
colored garments, leads by the hand a younger and smaller
girl, dressed in a simple flowing, white robe. Through the
lighter colored pieces of glass in the window the branches of
a tree can be seen stirring in a light wind.


The last credit FADES from the screen.


INT. STAIRWAY - HIGHCLIFFE ACADEMY - DAY

The CAMERA HOLDS ON the stained glass window. Beneath the
painted figures is a scroll, and on the scroll, a part of the
stained glass window, is an inscription:


I RUNNE TO DEATH AND DEATH MEETS ME AS FAST,
AND ALL MY PLEASURES ARE LIKE YESTERDAY. -

John Donne, Holy Sonnets VI.


As the CAMERA CONTINUES TO HOLD, the jumbled sound of
classroom recitations can be heard.

               GIRL'S VOICE
          (o.s. from classroom above
          camera level)
     Amo, arias, amat, amamus, amatis,
     amant.

               SECOND GIRL'S VOICE
          (o.s. from classroom below
          camera level)
     One times nine is nine.
     Two times nine is eighteen.
     Three times nine is twenty-seven.
     Four times nine is thirty-six

               THIRD GIRL'S VOICE
     (o.s. from classroom above camera
     level, singing)
     Do, no, mi, Pa, sol, la, ti, do.

These classroom sounds, although they can be heard clearly,
should not disturb the serenity of the stairway or of the
painted figures on which the CAMERA IS LEVELED.

Suddenly, from overhead, a gong rings with a harsh, jarring
noise. Doors are heard opening, feet scuffling over the floor
and the light, high sound of girls' voices chattering. A
moment later a cascade of uniformed schoolgirls of all ages
pours down the stairs past the camera. Against this tide one
single girl makes her way.

The CAMERA PANS WITH her up the remainder of the short flight
of stairs and across the hallway to a door marked, PRINCIPAL.
The girl knocks and from inside an over— cultured woman's
voice is heard in response,

               MRS. LOWOOD'S VOICE
     Come in, please.

CLOSE SHOT - Mary Gibson at the door. She hesitates before
opening it. She is young and her youth gives her prettiness,
but something in the quiet serenity of her face and the clear
candor of the eyes show the innate niceness of the girl; a
quality of character which will give her real beauty as she
grows older. At the moment she is somewhat perplexed by her
unexpected summons by the Head Mistress.

MED. CLOSE SHOT of Mary as she opens the door and looks
expectantly toward the desk. No one is there.

               MRS. LOW0OD'S VOICE
     Here we are, Mary.

MED. LONG SHOT as Mary walks into the room. It is a large
room and every effort has been made to invest it with
authority. A large Sheraton desk with side trays stands at
one end. On the wall behind this desk hangs a gloomy, dour
visaged portrait of the founder of the school. The wall
opposite the door is pierced by a large window. There are
several bookcases with dull-looking volumes; books of
reference and encyclopedia. On top of one of these cases is
the white, plaster head of Athena. The walls are covered with
enormous framed, sepia-tinted prints of the Acropolis, the
Colosseum, Trajan's Column and other celebrated ruins.

Mrs. Lowood, the Principal, a solidly built lady with iron
gray hair and her assistant, Miss Gilcrist, a slim, frail
lady of indeterminate age, are at a small table at the end of
the room. They are cutting out paper hearts. As Mary comes up
to them, Mrs. Lowood finishes cutting out a paper heart and
lays down the scissors with an air of satisfaction. With Mary
close behind her, she starts toward the desk. Miss Gilcrist
follows. The CAMERA PANS WITH them as they cross the room.

               MRS. LOWOOD
     I have a most painful matter to
     discuss with you, Mary.

Mary looks concerned.

Mrs. Lowood has reached her desk, while Mary stands wondering
what might come next. Mrs. Lowood deliberately seats herself
and puts her fingertips together firmly. Over this Gothic

               MARY
     Hello, Frances.

               FRANCES
     How's Miss Jacqueline?

               MARY
     I don't know. That's why I came to
     see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find
     her.

               FRANCES
     You mean Miss Jacqueline's gone,
     and you don't know where she is?

Mary nods. Frances beckons to Mary, and they pass through a
side door into a corridor that connects the plant with the
street.

INT. CORRIDOR - LA JEUNESSE COSMETICS, INC. - DAY

It is a narrow, gloomy passage. The two girls come into it
from the side door. Frances fishes a package of cigarettes
from her pocket, takes one, lights it as she speaks.

               FRANCES
     I don't get this. Miss Jacqueline
     was always so fond of you -- she
     was always talking about you -— had
     your picture in her office.

               MARY
     I know. For the first time I'm
     beginning to be frightened. I
     almost feel as if I'd never known
     my sister.

               FRANCES
     Nothing's happened to her. It's
     just that I can't understand her
     not getting in touch with you.

               MARY
     I can't understand it at all.

               FRANCES
     Well, don't worry. I saw Miss
     Jacqueline only a week ago. I saw
     her at a little restaurant the boy
     friend took me to -- an Italian
     place down in the Village —-     "The
     Dante."

               MARY
     "The Dante?"

               FRANCES
     It's on Peary Street. Just ask the
     people who run it. They'll remember
     her.
          (with reminiscent pride)
     People who see Miss Jacqueline
     never forget her.

               MARY
     I'll try there.

She starts to return to the salon, but Frances indicates to
her there is a short cut to the street by means of the long
hallway. The two girls smile at each other. Frances turns
back into the salon and Mary starts down the corridor.

EXT  DISPLAY WINDOW & SIDE ENTRANCE - LA JEUNESSE COSMETICS,
INC.- DAY

Mary comes out of the side entrance and passes the display
window. She looks up for a moment at the words "La Jeunesse"
and at the peculiar trade-mark of the company. It is on this
peculiar trade—mark, a geometric figure, that the scene

                              DISSOLVES

EXT.STREET CORNER - PEARY STREET - GREENWICH VILLAGE

It is after three o'clock, and the street is alive with
children. A covey of them flash past on roller skates, tailed
by one poor urchin with only one skate, who strives
desperately to keep up with the tail end of the procession.
Mary, coming around the corner, has to draw back half a step
to got out of his way.

A horse—drawn laundry truck stands at the curb on the
opposite side of the street, and a man is busily lifting down
bundles of soiled wash. On the other side Of the street is
the Dante. It is an Italian restaurant, a half-flight below
the street level. The name and the word "Restaurant" are
written on the glass in gold letters.

In the lower left hand corner of the window is a cardboard
sign, hand-lettered to read "Rooms for Rent". Above the
doorway is a poly-chrome bust of Dante. Mary crosses the
street to enter the Dante. A young man, Jason Hoag, comes
around the corner. He is a man about thirty-five years old,
and rather poorly dressed in an ordinary business suit and
trench coat  Under one arm he carries a load of books. He
stops and looks at Mary with interest. She continues on,
going down the steps, under the Dante statue, and into the
restaurant. Jason looks after her.

INT  DINING ROOM - DANTE RESTAURANT - DAY

This is a fairly good-sized room, with benches along the
walls and many small tables. Along one wall is a crudely
painted mural, a reproduction of the famous painting which
shows Dante's first meeting with Beatrice. Dante is passing
along the cobbled street, and Beatrice, with two companions,
large, flourishing wenches, is casting him a coy look over
her shoulder in passing. Directly under the feet of the poet
is a small table for one patron. On a back counter stands an
enormous, shining metal coffee machine. This is a patented
contraption for making coffee. The entire machine is
contrived to serve only one small purpose ——to make a cup of
coffee by driving steam through ground coffee. Near this
machine and flanking the door into the kitchen are fake palms
in wooden tubs. There is a door leading to the house hallway,
and through this door we can see the newel post of the
stairway leading to the rooms above. On most of the tables,
platters of antipasto have been arranged in readiness for the
dinner hour. When Mary enters, the restaurant is empty, but
echoes to the sound of a rich female voice singing with great
sentimental emphasis the words of "Care Mio Ben." Mary looks
around, hesitates a moment, and then starts toward the back
of the restaurant, as if following the source of the singing.
At the swinging door which separates the restaurant from the
kitchen Mary hesitates a moment, then knocks timidly. The
singing continues, and realizing that her knock will not be
heard above it, Mary shyly pushes open the door.

INT. KITCHEN - DANTE RESTAURANT - DAY

This is a cluttered, busy, steaming kitchen. In one corner at
a little table Mr. Romari, the proprietor, in a waiter's
uniform, is busily folding napkins. Mrs. Romari herself from
whose bosom come the sounds of

"Caro Mio Ben," can be seen through a cloud of steam behind a
boiling, kettle of spaghetti. She is a tall, gracious Italian
of sentiment and humor. Her pet pigeon in close attendance at
her feet. This bird follows her wherever she goes, hopping
about the floor at her heels. As Mrs. Romari wants to lift a
kettle of spaghetti from the stove and carry it to a center
table, she softly kicks the pigeon out on her way with a
practiced backward sweep of her slippered foot. Her turn
brings her face to face with Mary as she enters. Both the
Romaris look at her questioningly.

               MARY
     I'm worry to bother you. I want to
     ask you about my sister.

               ROMARI
          (getting up)
     Yes?

               MARY
     I thought you might know her. She
     was seen here about a week ago. Her
     name is Jacqueline Gibson.

               ROMARI
          (shrugging)
     I don't know no Gibson. This is a
     restaurant. Many people come here.

               MARY
     She's very beautiful.

Romari shrugs again.

               MARY (CONT'D)
     I wish I could tell you what she
     looked like -- I know you'd
     remember her, She is tall --with
     dark hair --

Romari shrugs. This all means nothing to him.

               MARY
     Once you'd seen my sister you'd
     never forget her.

               MRS. ROMARI
          (interrupting; to Romari)
     Giacomo -- la bellisslina madonna —-

               ROMARI
     Maybe.

               MRS. ROMARI
          (to Mary)
     Let me look at you -- you could be
     her sister

               MARY
          (smiling)
     Yes —— yes, if she made that much
     impression on you, I'm sure it was
     Jacqueline.

               MRS. ROMARI
     She's not been here for a long
     time.

               MARY
     But she was here?

               MRS. ROMARI
     Oh yes, yes. One day a beautiful
     car comes here. This beautiful lady
     in furs gets out. There is a
     handsome man with her, and the
     chauffeur  The lady rents one of
     our upstairs rooms. The chauffeur
     changes the lock on the door. Then
     the lady never comes back --not to
     live, anyhow. She came back three,
     four times, but always alone and
     just to eat.

Mary shakes her head in puzzlement.

               MARY
     You mean she just came here, rented
     the room, locked it, and left?

               MRS. ROMARI
     Yes -- and pays the rent every
     month.

               MARY
     Could you let me see that room? If
     it is hers, there might be
     something there to help me find my
     sister.

               ROMARI
          (shaking his head)
     No -- the rent in paid. The lady
     asked us to promise, I wouldn't
     open the door.

               MARY
     Please.

Romari shakes his head.

               MARY (CONT'D)
          (turning to Mrs. Romari,
          pleading)
     It's important

Mrs. Romari looks at her kindly.

DISSOLVE

INT. UPPER HALLWAY - DAUTE - DAY

Mary and the Romaris. It is a bleak hallway with a narrow
strip of worn carpet running down the exact middle of the
floor space. A picture of St. Francis of Assisi, surrounded
by fluttering white birds, hangs on the wall, a little bit
askew. Mrs. Romari and Mary stand near the stairway railing,
with the pigeon in close attendance on Mrs. Romari. Romari,
with a toolbox at his feet, is at the door, on which is the
number "7". He has taken off the bottom hinge and is now
striking a last few blows to remove the pin from the top
hinge.

As he works, a girl -- Mimi -- crosses in the background from
one hallway door _R;     Dòì

¸2}—�Ã/Rand a battered hat, with his time clock hanging from a
broad strap around his neck, comes out of a neighboring
store, a flower shop. He carefully closes the door behind him
and goes to the entrance of La Jeunesse. From a key ring
hanging from the leather clock strap he selects one key and
begins to open the door.

INT. PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

Mary still stands in the patch of light near the doorway.
Abreast of her is the doorway leading from the hall to the
salon. Through the glass upper half of the door, she sees a
gleam of light in the other room and tiptoes up to the door
and looks out.

EXT. SALON LA JEUNESSE - NIGHT

From Mary's angle, shooting through the window, can be soon
the night watchman, the beam of his flashlight coursing ahead
of him as he makes his way to a time clock. Ho rings in his
clock.

MED. CLOSE SHOT — Mary, nervous and apprehensive, looks
through at the night watchman. She makes a decision and
starts off along the hallway to warn August. She disappears
in the blackness of the unlit portion of the hallway.

REVERSE SHOT. At the far end of the hallway the illuminated
square of the street door can be seen, and the little patch
of light near it  Nearer the CAMERA a broad streak of light
from a partially open door is between the darkness and the
CAMERA. Mary comes out of tho darkness and into this light.
At the same moment, August comes out of the partially opened
door, blocking out the light for a minute. His shadow goes
ahead of him - contorted and strange. He stands a moment
before Mary; both of his hands clenched tightly against his
stomach. She speaks to him in a whisper.

               MARY
     Mr. August -- the night watchman

August makes no answer, but starts walking blindly, swaying a
little, toward the street door. Mary goes with him, walking
at his side, trying to peer into his face.

               MARY
     The night watchman -- he is in the
     salon.

Still August pays no attention.

               MARY
     Mr. August, what is it? What's the
     matter?

There is no answer. Ho continues to walk in the same jerky,
pain—gripped fashion, slowly and unsteadily, toward the
light. They are engulfed in the darkness.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - August and Mary from the street angle, as
they come out of the darkness. Mary is very agitated and
worried. August still continues to plod blindly forward. Mary
reaches out to touch his shoulder.

               MARY
     Mr. August --

Her hand touches his shoulder. Almost as if unable to bear
this trifling weight, he collapses suddenly at her foot. She
looks down.

CLOSEUP of Irving August's arm on the floor. It is sprawled
awkwardly out  The sleeve is darkly stained, and there is a
widening stain of blood upon the floor. Mary's slippered foot
step back so that the blood will not touch her.

Mary screams. The narrow hallway rings, echoes and reechoes
with the sound.

Mary runs wildly toward the door, fumbles with the knob and
pulls it brusquely open. As she does so, the beam of the
night watchman's searchlight comes in from the loft. O.S. a
wild bell starts to ring madly as Mary bolts in panic.

EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF LA JEUNESSE - NIGHT

Mary comes out of tin deer and starts running down the
street. Behind her the lights of both the hall and the salon
blaze. The bell rings o.s. she looks ever her shoulder and
continues running.

EXT. SUBWAY ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Mary, still running, comes down the street. She looks back
for a moment and then goes down the stairs to the subway.

The CAMERA REMAINS on the subway entrance a moment so that it
can be clearly seen that this entrance is marked:

FOURTEENTH STREET

DISSOLVE

INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT

It is late, and this particular car is almost empty. There is
Mary, .sitting huddled in one corner under the map of the
route which the I.R.T. so thoughtfully provides. Mary sits,
still and white, obviously shaken. Her coat collar is drawn
protectively against her throat. Opposite her are a pair of
young lovers, their hands clasped, who look blissfully into
each others eyes.

The conductor comes shambling into the car. He leeks at Mary
and takes a step toward her, teetering on practiced tees,

up. A big swirling monogram on the back is immediately
visible. The letters are: "J. G." Mary puts it down. In a
little ash tray beside the dressing case a cigarette is
smoldering. Mary points to it. Judd looks at it, then quickly
crosses the room to a door obviously leading to a bathroom.
He knocks, and receiving no answer, opens it and turns back
to the room.

               JUDD
     She's gone. She's left me to
     meet them alone. I can't.

Mary stands looking at him, amazed at this sudden transition:
the almost palpable fear of this smooth, easy, sneering man.

               MARY
          (softly)
     What makes you so nervous, Dr.
     Judd. Who are they?

Judd pays no attention to her. He walks quickly to the other
end of the room, then turns to face her.

               JUDD
     I can't stay here. I'll have
     to leave you.

Without any further word he strides quickly to the entrance
door, fumbles furiously with the chain and lock; opens it and
goes out, closing the door behind him.

Mary stands in the center of the room, completely at a loss.
She turns back to the desk and snuffs out the cigarette
thoughtfully. Again she examines the mirror or some other
article in the dressing case, As she stands there, looking at
her sister's initials, there is a soft knock at the door.
Mary crosses the room quickly and opens it.

TNT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE JUDD'S APT. - LATE AFTERNOON

MED. CLOSE SHOT - Jacqueline Gibson, dressed for the street
in a mink coat and a smart fur toque to match; an impressive,
beautiful, unforgettable woman, stands in this mean hallway.

TWO SHOT - Mary and Jacqueline in doorway.

               MARY
          (from doorway)
     Jacqueline!

Jacqueline lifts her hand and puts her forefinger stealthily
across her lips to indicate silence. They stand facing each
other this way for a single, breathing moment. Then suddenly
Jacqueline pulls the door shut.

TNT. JUDD'S APT. - LATE AFTERNOON

CLOSE SHOT of Mary, surprised and shocked by this sudden
move, stands stock—still for half a second. Then she rouses
herself. She starts tugging at the door. She gets it open and
starts out.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE JUDD'S APT. - LATE AFTERNOON

Mary comes out into the hall, looks first toward the left
stairway. There is no one there.

REVERSE SHOT. Apparently Mary looks to the right and again
sees that the hallway and the head of the second flight of
stairs is empty. She hesitates for a moment and then starts
off to the right.

TNT. FLANDERS APT.     STAIRWAY - LATE AFTERNOON

Mary runs down the stairs.

TNT. FOYER - FLANDERS APT. - LATE AFTERNOON

Mary comes down the stairs. The foyer is empty. She crosses
to the other stairs and looks up, sees no one, turns and goes
out the street door.

EXT. FLANDERS     APT. - LATE AFTERNOON

Mary comes out and looks up and down the street. The street
is empty except for a few men passing by. She stands for a
moment, the wind blowing her skirt against her legs and
tugging at her hair. She turns and goes back into the
building.

INT. FOYER - FLANDERS APT. - LATE AFTERNOON

Mary comes in and starts to mount the stairs.

                              DISSOLVE

INT. HALLWAY IN FRONT OF JUDD' S AFT.     LATE AFTERNOON

Mary comes up to the hallway. The door of the apartment is
still open. She turns and enters.

INT. JUDD'S APT. - LATE AFTERNOON

Mary re—enters the room. She goes over to the dressing table
where she had left her purse and picks it up. As she does
this something in the mirror attracts her attention, and a
look of terror comes into her face. In the mirror can be seen
the back of a large chair near the bureau. Over the top of
this chair floats a rising column of cigar smoke. Mary turns.

ANOTHER ANGLE. A man enters from the left of the scene and
seizes Nary's arm. From the armchair another man rises. It is
Paul Radeau, the man with Irving August at the Missing
Persons Bureau.

               MAN
          (to Radeau)
     Is this her?

               RADEAU
     Nope.
          (turning to Mary, removing
          his cigar from his mouth)
     Where's Jacqueline Gibson?

               MARY
          (frightened)
     I don't know.

               RADEAU
     She was just here. Where's she
     gone?

               MARY
     I tell you I don't know.

               RADEAU
     That's funny. You went out with
     her, came back alone, and don't
     know where she went.

               MARY
     I don't know.

There is a pause while Radeau studies her and Mary's courage
comes back to her.

               MARY
     Why do you want Jacqueline? What
     right have you to question me?

Radeau pulls an official looking document from his pocket.

               RADEAU
     Young lady, I've got all the right
     in the world. I'm Paul Radeau,
     private investigator, and I have
     been hired to find your sister by
     her husband, Gregory Ward.

CLOSEUP of Mary's face as the full realization of what he has
said comes to her.

               MARY
          (almost in a whisper)
     Husband --

                              DISSOLVE

INT. DINING ROOM - DANTE - NIGHT

The restaurant is full, cheerful and noisy with the merry
sound of people eating, drinking and talking.

MED. CLOSE SHOT of Jason Hoag seated at the feet of Dante. A
small quarto volume is opened at his left hand and he is
reading as he eats his antipasto. Without looking he takes
the last forkful from the plate scrabbles about with his fork
for another forkful but finds only emptiness, and he turns
his attention from his book to his plate. He puts down his
fork and looks off beyond the camera, calling out at the same
time.

               JASON
          (in Italian)
     What ho, wench! Would you keep
     a benighted traveller waiting?

REVERSE SHOT - kitchen door. Mrs. Romari, a beaming smile on
her face, comes from the kitchen bearing an enormous platter
of spaghetti. She weaves her way through the tables, holding
the platter high over the heads of the customers. She passes
a table at which Mary is seated with Gregory Ward. As it is a
wall table, they sit side by side. Both look miserable, their
faces averted, Gregory is talking eagerly to Mary's
turned—away profile. Mrs. Romari passes them and advances
toward the table where Jason sits.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - Jason at his table. Mrs. Romari     comes into
the scene beaming, puts the platter on the     table before
Jason.

               MRS. ROMARI
          (in Italian)
     Jason, my pet ——

               JASON
     Bella Romari     If I were not
     seated, I would embrace you in
     three movements like a sonata.
          (in very bad Italian)
     Ah, my wonderful one. Fly with me
     tonight. We will take your coffee
     machine and live with the gypsies.

Mrs. Romari giggles with delight and translates Jason's
atrocious Italian to two maiden ladies who are gawking at
this unrestrained conversation.

               MRS. ROMARI
          (in Italian)
     Oh, this funny man.
          (in English)
     He is a very funny man, but I
     love him.

While she is talking, Jason has been appreciatively sniffing
the aroma of the spaghetti. As she turns back to him, he
points to his wine glass.

               JASON
     What are you thinking of, Bella?
     Can I eat dry?

               MRS. ROMARI
     Oh, the wine. I have forgotten
     the wine.

Mrs. Romari goes toward the kitchen.

The CAMERA DOLLIES WITH her. As she passes the table where
Gregory and Mary are sitting, the CAMERA STOPS, FOCUSING on
them.

               GREGORY
     Look, Mary, just because I kept a
     secret from you doesn't make me a
     monster. Please look at me, Mary.

Mary pays no attention, but busies herself by taking a sip of
water and pretends to be very interested in Mrs. Romari's
further progress through the dining room.

               GREGORY
     Can't I make you understand? The
     secret wasn't mine in the first
     place. It was Jacqueline's. I don't
     know why. She never wanted anything
     from me -- not even my name ——

Mary still looks obstinately away. Gregory shakes his head,
pauses, and then goes on.

               GREGORY
     Please —- I can't explain things
     like this to your right ear.

               MARY
     Last night in this very restaurant
     Mr. Jason Hoag paid a very pretty
     compliment to my right ear.

               GREGORY
          (exasperated)
     Who the devil is he?

               MARY
     A poet. He's sitting right over
     there. That's his table —— the one
     at the feet of Dante.

She half turns to indicate Jason's position.

MED. CLOSE SHOT of Jason. He sees Mary looking toward him. He
smiles and nods to her.

MED. CLOSE SHOT of Mary and Gregory. Mary nods back to Jason.

               GREGORY
          (looking off at Jason)
     He seems all right.
          (then resuming his former
          conversationM@ÌŒ�

Jason turns to Mary.

               JASON
     Mary, when you first came here, I
     told you to look into your heart.
     You didn't listen to me. You
     listened to the policeman instead.
     You didn't find your sister, did
     you?

               GREGORY
          (protesting)
     Look here, just because Mrs. Romari
     asked you to amuse us.

Jason rises and takes Mary's hand.

               JASON
     This city is my world. I know every
     rat-infested corner of my world and
     every starlit chamber of its purity
     and greatness.

He half draws Mary to her feet.

               GREGORY
     You don't even know where to start -
     -

Jason takes Mary along with him, starting for the door.

               JASON
     One starts by beginning.
     Beginnings lead to an end.

Ward is forced to rise and go with them.

                              DISSOLVE

EXT. STREET WASHINGTON MEWS - NIGHT

Jason and Ward with Mary between them, cross the street
toward the north side of Washington Mews. To their right is
the mews, the little houses one next to the other in an
orderly row. They stop for a moment at the street corner.

               GREGORY
     Well?

               JASON
          (disregarding his
          question)
     This is the part of New York I
     love. It is old. It has memories.
     If you listen, the houses will
     speak to you. Walt Whitman...Edna
     St. Vincent Millay... Eugene
     O'Neill...in their time they've all
     lived here.

He goes on to the next house and they follow. The CAMERA
DOLLIES WITH them.

               GREGORY
     All very nice but, what are you
     going to do - listen at every house
     in New York for Jacqueline's voice?

               JASON
          (as if it explained
          everything)
     I'm looking for a party -- a merry
     party.

               GREGORY
     Well, that's illuminating.

Even Mary looks concerned and puzzled. They have stopped
before the next house and again Jason has taken the attitude
of one listening. The sound of a violin can be heard playing
Abenlied.

               JASON
     Only music. It leads, but we cannot
     follow.

He starts off again. Ward and Mary follow him.

               GREGORY
          (shaking his head)
     Riddles now.

By this time they have come to the third house and again
Jason has paused.

               JASON
     Wait. This is a party.

               WOMAN'S VOICE
          (from interior of house)
     Now, if you'll all take your seats,
     Miss Randall will show us the
     slides she took of Woods Hole
     Marine Institute this summer.

               JASON
     Sounds dull, doesn't it? My ear is
     perfectly trained. I can tell the
     brand of liquor and the quality of
     the guests from the noise they
     make.

From the next house comes the sound of revelry, laughter and
a burst of jazz music from a phonograph which obscures the
milder noises of the house in front of which they stand.

               JASON
          (excitedly)
     That sounds more like it. Come on.

He grabs hold of Mary's hand and draws her along. They go up
to the door. Ward follows them.

INT. NATALIE CORTEZ' HOUSE - NIGHT

CLOSE SHOT of Natalie Cortez. She is seated at a small card
table, shuffling a pack of cards with one hand, and
surrounded by a small group of her guests in evening clothes.
Natalie is a very beautiful woman of early middle age. It is
apparent why she uses only one hand to shuffle her cards. She
has but one arm. A     little cape of gold lame covers her
shoulders and hangs down over the missing arm.

               JUDD'S VOICE
     Shuffle the cards well, Natalie.
     This is a trick of telepathy not
     card manipulation

ANOTHER SHOT of the same group to include Judd, who stands a
little distance away with his back purposely turned to the
card table. Mrs. Cortez is finishing shuffling the cards. The
door knocker sounds.

               JUDD
     Now pass me the cards.

The knocker sounds again and Mrs. Cortez hands the cards to
Gladys, a big, gushy girl, full of hormones and cocktail gin.

               MRS. CORTEZ
          (rising)
     Gladys, you hand the deck to Louis
     while I answer the door.

Gladys takes the cards and crosses to Judd, who still stands
with his back to his audience, while Mrs. Cortez turns and
walks in the other direction.

REVERSE SHOT - toward the door. For the first time Mrs.
Cortez' living quarters can be seen. The house was formerly a
stable on the Mews and in remodeling it for living purposes
Mrs. Cortez has allowed the stalls and general architecture
of the stable to remain. She uses one of the two stalls as a
little dining nook, although above it the name of the horse,
"Apocalypse" is still printed on a placard. The next stall
has been converted into a little escritoire, and over this
stall is the name "Morning Star." The place is lit with
electrified stable and carriage lamps and furnished with
harness and horse adornments which contrast with the rich
piled carpet, the lovely square piano of rosewood and the
beautiful modern prints with plain wood frames. Book shelves
cover the largest portion of the walls.

Mrs. Cortez wends her way through little groups of her guests
and goes to the door.

MED. CLOSE SHOT of the door as Mrs. Cortez opens it revealing
Mary, Ward and Jason on the threshold.

               MRS. CORTEZ
     Jason! How nice to see you.

               JASON
          (taking her hand)
     I have brought some friends,
     Natalie. May we all come to your
     party?

               MRS. CORTEZ
     Of course.

               JASON
     Mrs,. Cortez, Mary Gibson and Mr.
     Ward.

               MRS. CORTEZ
          (to Mary)
     It's so nice to meet you.

Jason has been looking about trying to peer over the heads of
various other guests. Suddenly he turns back to Mrs. Cortez
and Mary.

               JASON
     You'll have to excuse me.

ANOTHER ANGLE - Jason emerges between two groups of people.
The CAMERA PICKS him up and DOLLIES WITH him up to the group
around Judd. Judd has turned and is facing them with the
cards in his hands.

               JUDD
     Mrs. Freeman, yours was the Jack of
     Spades. Gladys, yours was the Seven
     of Diamonds, and Mrs. Gosden, the
     Queen of Hearts -—

There is a murmur of admiration from the little group.

               GLADYS
     How do you ever do it, Louis?

Jason makes his way through the group and faces Judd.

               JUDD
     Hello, Jason.

Jason takes his arm and draws him away a few feet from the
group.

               JASON
          (sotto voce)
     Where is Jacqueline Gibson?

               JUDD
          (smiling)
     What a peculiar question.

               JASON
     I saw you with her last week. I
     knew you'd be here tonight. Where
     is she?

               JUDD
     My dear fellow, it's neither your
     business to ask, nor mine to tell.

He tries to move away. Jason takes his arm again.

               JASON
     Wait. Look over there.

He half turns so that Judd faces the door.

               JASON
     See that girl? That's Jacqueline's
     sister. It's because of her I ask.

               JUDD
     But why come to me?

               JASON
     Because there was another girl—
     years ago -- a nice girl. She lived
     on Barrow Street. I saw her with
     you once -— I saw her with you
     twice and then I never saw her
     again. That's why.

               JUDD
     She was my patient.

He pauses.

               JUDD
     What was she to you?

               JASON
     I don't think that you would
     understand if I told you.

               JUDD
     I think I understand without your
     telling me. I know something of
     your history, Jason. I know that
     you haven't written for ten years.

               JASON
     I've lost my knack.

               JUDD
     After that wonderful first book —-
     after all the adulation and the
     good reviews?

Jason looks away.

               JUDD
     I would have given anything if I
     could have written that book. You
     had all my admiration and respect —
     once.

MED. SHOT - Mary, Mrs. Cortez and Ward.

               MRS. CORTEZ
     Now that you know me, you must feel
     free to come often.

Over this shot comes the sound of Jason's voice calling Mary.
Mary smiles at Mrs. Cortez and looks off.

LONG SHOT from Mary's ANGLE of the group around Judd and
Jason. Jason is beckoning to her.

THREE SHOT - Mary, Mrs. Cortez and Ward. Mary gives Mrs.
Cortez a smile of apology and starts toward Jason. Ward takes
her arm to lead her through the party throng.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - the group around Jason and Judd as Mary and
Ward come in.

               JUDD
          (imperturbably)
     Hello, Ward.

He makes a half bow to Mary.

               JUDD
     My dear Miss Gibson --

It is at this point that Gladys comes bursting back. She
picks up the name "Gibson" and rushes ever to Mary.

               GLADYS
     Gibson? Are you Jacqueline's
     sister?

               MARY
     Yes. Do you --

               GLADYS
          (not letting her finish)
     Know her! My dear, we were
     intimate! The times we used to have
     together! I bet she never told you
     about that -- you're too young.

               GREGORY
     I'm afraid you don't understand.
     Miss Gibson's sister is missing ——

               GLADYS
     Missing? Well, no wonder. When she
     took up with Louis Judd she went
     out of circulation, like that!

She snaps her fingers. Mary looks from Judd to Ward.

The two men stare fixedly at each other.

               GLADYS
          (to Mary)
     My dear, have I said something?

               JASON
          (to Gladys in a low voice)
     No. You've just turned the dagger
     in the wound - - a beautiful job.

He looks quickly over to Mary, sees tears coming to her eyes,
takes her elbow and leads her to another part of the room.
Gladys' attention is attracted by laughter from another group
of the party and she drifts off. Ward and Judd are left
together.

               JUDD
          (to Ward)
     There are too many people here. I
     think Jacqueline may be lonely --?
     for me.

Judd grins. He wanders off. Gregory stands scowling after
him.

TWO SHOT - Jason and Mary. They have seated themselves in the
little breakfast nook built in the horses' stall.

               JASON
     You see, Mary, I'm not quite a
     fool.

Mary nods.

               MARY
     At least you knew about Dr. Judd.

               JASON
     Yes.

               MARY
     And you knew he'd be here.

               JASON
     Yes. And now that I've shown
     you that I know that much, and can
     guess more -- will you trust me to
     look for Jacqueline?

               MARY
     I want you to look for Jacqueline.

He takes her hand across the table and holds it firmly.

               JASON
     I'm a terrible failure, Mary, -- a
     book clerk by day and a poet by
     night, and not a very good one -
     but if you'll trust me -- at this
     one thing I won't fail --I'll find
     your sister.

                              DISSOLVE

INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY

CLOSE SHOT of Jason leaning on a file counter in the library.
Beside him is an enormous file of cards and right under his
nose, two pretty white hands ruffle the cards.

               JASON
          (admiringly)
     You have such lovely hands, Miss
     Gottschalk. So slim and capable --

The CAMERA PULLS BACK to show us Miss Gottschalk. The face
doesn't match the hands.

               MISS GOTTSCHALK
          (gurgling)
     Oh, Mr. Jason. I really shouldn't
     be doing this, you know. It's
     against the rules.
          (curiously)
     When did you say you wanted them?

               JASON
     I want to see what they read so
     I'll know what kind of books to
     give my friends as presents.
     There's nothing nicer for a gift
     than a book.

               MISS GOTTSCHALK
     Who was the first one -- Mrs. Redi?

Jason nods.

               MISS GOTTSCHALK
          (ruffling through the
          cards)
     N - o - p - q - r - r - Redi.
     Here it is.

She takes the card out of the file and hands it to Jason.

               MISS GOTTSCHALK
     And the other was Judd?

               JASON
     Yes, Dr. Louis Judd.

               MISS GOTTSCHALK
     It's here, too.

She hands it over to Jason.

               JASON
     Would it be asking too much, Miss
     Gottschalk, for you to get me these
     books?

               MISS GOTTSCHALK
          (gurgling again)
     No, not at all, Mr. Jason.

She takes the cards and glances at the numbers and stops.

               MISS GOTTSCHALK
          (coyly)
     Why, Mr. Jason. Most of these books
     are on the closed shelf. You have
     to get permission.

               JASON
          (using Miss Gottschalk's
          tone)
     I wouldn't want to take them out. I
     just want to look at them.

               MISS GOTTSCHALK
          (relenting)
     Well, since, you're over twenty
     one——

Giggling, she turns to go.

DISSOLVE

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY- DANTE - DAY

Jason comes up the stairs whistling. As he reaches the
landing, Mimi comes out of her door at the end of the
corridor and goes across to the bathroom. She is in her
soiled dressing gown, her hair lank about her shoulders. She
carries a towel over one arm.

               JASON
          (waving to her)
     Mimi!

She turns toward him and is about to speak when a fit of
coughing takes her. She passes on, goes through the doorway
to the bath. Jason goes on to a door halfway down the hall,
#lO. He knocks on the door. Mary's voice can be heard bidding
him enter.

               MARY'S VOICE
     Come in.

Jason turns the knob and throws the door open. Through the
open door Mary's room can be seen. It is a small, dismal

INT. NATALIE CORTEZ' APT. - LATE EVENING

LONG SHOT  There is a fire burning in the fireplace. The
lamps have been lit, although outdoors there is still a gray,
cold light in the street. The room looks bright and warm.
There are about a dozen people who are     standing and sitting,
smoking and chatting. Before the sofa a tea service has been
set on the coffee table. An alcohol stove keeps the tea water
hot and a slight steam rises from the tea kettle.

Among the guests can be seen certain familiar faces. Frances
Fallon stands near the door talking with a young man, Mr.
Durk, who can be recognized as one of the two drunks who
supported the body of Irving August on the subway. The other
of the two drunks, Mr. Leo, is seated by himself in an
armchair looking through a record album. In his street
clothes, chatting with a very lovely, white-haired woman, is
Joseph, the workman at La Jeunesse.

Mrs. Cortez is opening the door, as the scene opens, to admit
Mrs. Redi, who is dressed in exactly the same clothes she
wore in the previous scene.

               MRS. REDI
          (starting to remove her
          furs)
     I'm sorry to be late, Natalie.

               MRS. CORTEZ
          (taking the furs and
          hanging them over the
          back of a chair)
     We haven't even begun tea yet.

The two women cross to the sofa and sit down. On the way
across the room, Mrs. Redi nods to several of the people
standing about. She and Mrs. Cortez seat themselves.

               MRS. CORTEZ
     Won't you pour, Mrs. Redi?

Mrs. Redi pours out a cup of tea. Her hand trembles and she
moves rather awkwardly.

               MRS. REDI
     Sorry. I'm nervous. This is very
     trying for me.

               MRS. CORTEZ
     I know. You introduced Jacqueline
     to us -- but how could you tell —-

               MRS. REDI
     I should have known. She had no
     sincerity —- no real belief.

Mrs. Cortez pats Mrs. Redi's hand comfortingly, then turns
and calls out,

               MRS. CORTEZ
     Cream or lemon, Frances?

               FRANCES
     Lemon.

Frances comes forward and Mr. Durk comes with her. They stand
beside the sofa near Mrs. Redi. Mrs. Redi pours another cup
of tea. Mrs. Cortez poises the cream pitcher over it. She
turns to a tall dark-haired woman who is standing near the
window.

               MRS. CORTEZ
     Miss Rowan, do you take cream?

Miss Rowan, without bothering to answer, strides across the
room and takes the teacup from her hand. She seats herself in
a small chair facing the sofa. Mrs. Redi starts to pour
another cup of tea, but has a slight mishap. There is a
clatter.

               MRS. REDI
     Please, Natalie, would you mind
     pouring?

Mrs. Cortez takes the teapot in her hand and begins pouring.

               MISS ROWAN
     You shouldn't be nervous. There is
     nothing personal or vengeful in
     what we are about to do. We have
     only to make a decision.

A tall quiet woman has come up to the table. She speaks
to Mrs. Cortez.

               MRS. SWIFT
     But it can be such a horrible
     decision. I found peace here. I
     know that a large portion of that
     peace came because we are all
     pledged to non-violence. Now this --

               MISS ROWAN
     Our founder must have known when he
     wrote these seemingly contradictory
     rules -— the rule of non-violence
     and the law that whoever betrays us
     must die -- he must have known.

               FRANCES
     But I can't understand it.

Mrs. Redi turns to her.

               MRS. REDI
     Some of us, Frances, must believe
     without understanding.

               FRANCES
     Yes.

As she speaks, a mature, handsome, forceful man dressed in a
dark business suit, Mr. Bruns, comes forward.

               MRS. REDI
     I went back through the history
     last night. I read about Johann
     Rozenquartz -- I read what he
     wrote --

               MR. BRUNS
     I can quote it fully, Mrs. Redi.
     "We will avoid violence. For once
     undertaken, violence becomes its
     own master and can lead to either
     good or evil."

               MRS. REDI
     But he also wrote --

               MR. BRUNS
          (interrupting)
     I can quote that too; "Those who
     shall go out into the market place
     and let their tongues speak of us,
     and give knowledge of our being and
     our deeds, whom-so-ever doeth this
     shall die."

               MRS. SWIFT
     Since the founding of our order
     there have been six betrayals and
     six deaths. And now there is
     Jacqueline —— she is the seventh.

               FRANCES
     You can't do anything to her--
     you mustn't hurt her!

               MRS. CORTEZ
     But she betrayed us, Frances.

               FRANCES
     She never betrayed us. She was only
     going to a doctor -- a
     psychiatrist.

               MRS. REDI
     But she told him, Frances. She told
     him about us.

               MR. BRUNS
          (to Frances)
     I know this is difficult for you. I
     know that you love her.

               FRANCES
     She didn't betray us!

               MR. BRUNS
     Even if I believed that, I would
     still consider her dangerous. There
     is the matter of Irving August's
     death. Without consulting me, Mrs.
     Redi was ill—advised enough to have
     the body removed by Leo and Durk.
     This makes us all a party to the
     crime. What if there is a trial?
     What if Jacqueline is asked how the
     body was removed? Do you think,
     Frances, she would keep silent?

There is a long pause. He looks around the circle.

               MR. BRUNS
     It is a very real danger and one
     which forces our decision.

               MRS. REDI
     What about Judd -- he knows about
     us.

               MRS. CORTEZ
     He will come to us of himself ——
     the man is evil.

               MR. BRUNS
     And Jacqueline's sister?

               MRS. REDI
     I have taken care of Mary. I've
     spoken to her. She's going back to
     school.

               MR. BRUNS
     Then it is decided. Leo and Durk
     and I will make our plans.

Frances Fallen begins to cry. Outside the streetlights go on.

INT. JASON'S ROOM - NIGHT

It is a small room with a skylight. There are no curtain on
the skylight. Behind it the night sky can be seen, and
occasionally the beam of a searchlight cuts across. There is
a bed, an easy chair and a desk with a typewriter stand
beside it. The walls of the room are almost hidden by
bookcases and books, and even the mantel bears a burden of
numerous volumes. Jason is seated at his desk, turned toward
the typewriter. He types a line, reads it inaudibly and at
the same time beats out the rhythm with his left hand on the
desk top. Evidently it scans, because he types another line
and is about to repeat the rhythmic test on it, when there is
a small knock on the door. He gets up, crosses the room and
opens the door. Mary stands outside. She is dressed in the
little traveling suit she wore in the first sequence and
wears a hat.

               JASON
          (pulling her into the
          room)
     Mary!

He shuts the door behind her, then stands to watch her as she
looks around the room. He smiles happily.

               JASON
     Mary This is so wonderful!

Mary looks at him questioningly.

               JASON
     Your being here -- your coming so
     unexpectedly -— it's a wish come
     true --

He takes her hand and leads her further into the room.

               JASON
     I want you to see my room. I want
     you to see all of it.

               MARY
          (smiling)
     But it's a small room, Jason.

               JASON
     It's grown big with time -- I've
     lived here with the Romari's for
     ten years -- the room's become part
     of me. I want you to see it —— to
     know me better.

He waves at the bookcase.

               JASON
     My books --

He leads forward a step and bends down to touch a battered
little tavern table of old maple wood.

               JASON
     My furniture --

He draws her forward still another step toward the desk and
points to the window.

               JASON
     My window - - through which I see
     the world.

               MARY
          (looking toward the night
          sky)
     It's beautiful -- that searchlight
     - the stars --

               JASON
     It's not a searchlight —— it's a
     sword blade cutting the blue cloak
     of a prince —- not stars --

               MARY
          (interrupting; turning to
          face him)
     Jason, I'm going back to
     Highcliffe. I came to say good-by.

Jason looks at her. He is silent, but his face shows her his
concern.

               JASON
          (smiling)
     I thought your coming up here to
     the third floor to see me —-that it
     was your advent into my world. It
     turns out to be good-by. Why?

               MARY
     I have to go —-

               JASON
     But you're happy here -- you like
     your work —-

He suddenly senses the compulsion that had been in her words.

               JASON
     It isn't that -- you said, "have to
     go." What could compel you --

               MARY
     Don't make me tell you, Jason.

               JASON
     I thought myself your friend, Mary.
     Just good-bye isn't enough for a
     friend.

banister, watching. Finally, they break from their embrace.
Mary is crying and Jacqueline is half-laughing, half-crying.
She holds Mary off at arm's length, looking at her.

               JACQUELINE
     Mary!

She sees the two men in the doorway, and starts back
fearfully. Gregory steps forward.

               GREGORY
     Jacqueline.

She stands quite still, looking at him nervously.

               GREGORY
     It's all right.

Jacqueline turns back to Judd and moves a little in his
direction. Judd continues to lean against the banister,
smiling.

               GREGORY
     You're safe. Nothing is going to
     hurt you.

               JUDD
     Your husband seems very sure of
     that.

Again she looks from one to the other.

               GREGORY
     Yes. I'm very sure there's only one
     way to protect you -- to help you
     you've got to come with     us-- let
     me do all that I can as a lawyer to
     straighten out Irving August's
     death.

               JACQUELINE
     You know?

               GREGORY
     Yes.

               MARY
     You must come with us, darling. You
     must let us help you.

Mary extends her arms to her sister and Jacqueline goes into
them.

               JUDD
          (to Jason)
     For me -— this seems to be the end
     of a delightful relationship.

Judd smiles and shrugs his shoulders.

                              DISSOLVE

INT.     JASON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

There is a bright fire in the fireplace. Jason is crouched
before the fire. He has a coffee pot set up on the edges of
three bricks inside the fireplace, and on the hearth is a
reflector baker with biscuits baking in it. A bottle of cream
and other oddments and endments of his culinary art are
strewn about on the hearth.

Jacqueline is seated before the fire in an armchair with Mary
at her feet. Mary's head is resting against Jacqueline's
knee. Gregory sits on a straight chair, a little
uncomfortable, and facing them from the other side of the
fire. Judd lounges on the bed.

Jason wraps a tea towel around his hand and reaches in the
fireplace for the coffee pot. He pours out a cup of coffee
and then with the same wrapped hand snatches a biscuit from
the baker, and puts it on the edge of the coffee saucer. He
hands it to Jacqueline. Her hand trembles as she takes it.

               JASON
          (as he passes the coffee)
     Here, this will put some life into
     you.

               JACQUELINE
          (looking fixedly into the
          fire)
     It's like coming back to life.

               GREGORY
     Jacqueline, it would be so much
     easier if you would tell me just
     what happened. I'd know what to do
     for you.

Jacqueline shakes her head,

               MARY
     Please, Jacqueline.

               JACQUELINE
     You know about the Palladists --
     you know who they are -- what they
     are. I was one of them.

She pauses, and Judd in moving from his place on the bed,
speaks.

               JUDD
     Jacqueline was always a
     sensationalist, trying to seize
     onto something -- anything -- in
     order to find happiness. Through
     Mrs. Redi she stumbled onto the
     Palladist movement —- it appealed
     to her.

               JACQUELINE
          (shuddering)
     I wasn't happy with them -- wanted
     to break away —— was miserable. I
     went to Louis for help. They felt
     that I had betrayed them. They
     wanted me to die -- to kill myself.
     They kept me locked up at La
     Jeunesse. I was there such a long
     time.

She stops.

               JUDD
     You can Imagine the effect of such
     imprisonment on Jacqueline.

               JACQUELINE
     I was terrified. The darkness in
     the corners of the room --the
     little noises. Then one night the
     door opened -- a man came in ——
     tip—toeing in. I had a scissors in
     my hand -- I struck at him, I ran
     away. He was lying in the hall with
     the blood around him.

She shudders.

               MARY
          (comforting her)
     Don't. We know what happened. Don't
     go on.

               GREGORY
     Any court in the land would
     understand. We'll wait a few days --
     let you rest -- then we'll go to
     the police.

               MARY
     It will all be over in such a
     little while, Jacqueline, and
     everything will be all right again.
     Drink your coffee.

Jacqueline raises the cup to her lips and sips. Jason busies
himself at the fire again.

               GREGORY
     I thought I might close up the
     apartment -- maybe get a place in
     Connecticut.

               MARY
     You'd love that, Jackie. Remember
     that last summerþs“iÀÏ¬†@Á™y�ò

can be heard the sound of Mrs. Romari singing. Then Mimi's
door opens and Mimi sweeps out, dressed in a black dress,
gleaming with sequins, her hair piled high, her walk proud
and steady. She comes down the hall toward the camera. Just
as she reaches the door of #7, there is the sound of an
over—turned chair falling. She pauses and looks toward the
door. There is the creaking sound of the rope. She listens
for an instant, and failing to comprehend, sweeps on past the
camera.

INT. DANTE RESTAURANT - MORNING

It is a bright day and the sunlit street can be seen through
the windows. Children are hurrying by on their way to school,
At a table near the window Mary sits with Gregory. She has
been crying and has her sodden handkerchief in her hand.
Gregory has a pre-occupied air and is tracing figures on the
table cloth with his fork.

Jason comes in bearing a small tray with three tiny cups of
coffee on it. He puts a cup in front of each of them and
keeps one for himself. He sips his coffee.
Neither Mary nor Gregory touch theirs Jason pushes Mary's cup
toward her to attract her attention, She picks it up and
brings it to her lips.

               JASON
     I hate people who try to peddle
     comfort. But,Mary, you shouldn't
     mourn for Jacqueline. Life for her
     was full of the agony of a
     disordered mind. It's better this
     way.

               MARY
     I keep telling myself that.

               GREGORY
     Well, tell yourself, Mary, that
     this is a world that doesn't pass
     with the passing of any one of us.
     All three of us are going to start
     afresh.

He looks up and across at Jason with a meaningful glance at
Mary.

               GREGORY
     You and I have new hopes —— and new
     plans can come from them ——

Jason looks at him across Mary and shakes his head.

               JASON
     Not I —- I am alive, yet every hope
     I had is dead,
          (turns to Mary)
     Death can be good. Death can be
     happy.. If I were really dying I
     could speak like Cyrano -— "My
     courage like a white plume" — and
     all the other lovely words with
     which he greeted death. Then
     perhaps you might understand,

               MARY
          (reaching over to touch
          (his band)
     I understand.

               JASON
          (suddenly)
     Good. We all understand each other.
     You, Gregory and I. We all know.
     There is sunlight in the streets
     and work to do. Both of you -—
     you're off to work.

He gets up and takes Mary's arm, helping her to rise.

               JASON
     Off with you. You can't sit here in
     this cellar with the sun shining.

He hustles her toward the door and Gregory follows. Mary and
Gregory ascend the steps to the street level.

Jason steps back a pace or two so that he is backgrounded by
the mural of Dante. He stands there, and the smile leaves his
face. His whole body reflects his hopelessness and despair.
It is at this moment that Mrs. Romari comes hustling in from
the kitchen.

               MRS. ROMARI
     Ah! Good! They have all gone! Now
     you and I can laugh and joke again.

He turns to her, forcing a smile.

                              FADE OUT
