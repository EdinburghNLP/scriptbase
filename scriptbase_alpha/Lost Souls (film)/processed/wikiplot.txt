A small group of Roman Catholics believe that Satan intends to become man just as God did in the person of Jesus.
Writings from a seemingly possessed mental patient lead them to Peter Kelson (Chaplin).
The group suspect that it is his body Satan has chosen to occupy.
The youngest of the group Maya Larkin (Ryder), meets Peter to investigate further and to try to convince him of embodied evil.
Other signs come to him as he and Maya take a journey full of strange occurrences, self-discovery and an ultimate showdown.
