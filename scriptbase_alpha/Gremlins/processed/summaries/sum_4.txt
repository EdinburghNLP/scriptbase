Gremlins begins with inventor Rand Peltzer trying to find a quick gift for his son Billy before returning home from a New York trip.
He settles on a unique pet in a Chinatown curio shop--a cute, furry creature known as a Mogwai.
Before he leaves, he is warned by the shop's owner that three rules must be obeyed by a Mogwai owner: 1) Keep it away from bright light, 2) Don't get any water on it, and 3) Never, never ever feed it after midnight.
Rand takes note of these rules and returns home with the Mogwai to his idyllic small-town home of Kingston Falls.
Rand's gift is an instant hit: Billy loves his adorable new pet, naming it Gizmo and taking it everywhere he goes.
Unfortunately, he and his friends also begin breaking the rules of Mogwai care.
When water is accidentally spilled on Gizmo, it causes him to multiply and produce a number of mischievous little brothers.
Among these is the mean-tempered Stripe.
Soon enough, the new Mogwai get hold of some food after midnight and this causes them to change from cute fur-balls into nasty, scaly monsters dubbed 'Gremlins.'
