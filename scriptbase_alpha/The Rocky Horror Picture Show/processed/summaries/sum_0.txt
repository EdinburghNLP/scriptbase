It's the weird and wonderful as newly engaged couple Brad and Janet encounter a problem when they car halts in the rain.
They both look for contact only to find themselves at the castle of Dr. Frank-N-Furter a transvestite.
A place to stay is offered, but will Brad and Janet want to remain there?
Especially when a large group of Transylvanians dance to the 'Time Warp', Dr. Frank-N-Furter builds his own man and a whole host of participation for the audience to enjoy.
