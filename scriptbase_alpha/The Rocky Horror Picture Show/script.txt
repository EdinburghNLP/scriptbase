15     EXT.     A STILL FRAME OF A DENTON CATHOLIC CHURCH     DAY

                         CHORUS (Cont)
               To the late night double feature
               Picture Show.

     The SONG ends with church bells ringing joyously as the IMAGE EXPANDS TO 
     WIDE-SCREEN.  The STILL FRAME bursts to life as the doors of the Denton 
     Catholic Church are flung open and Mendelssohn's wedding march resounds 
     from the church organ.

     The young married couple, RALPH and BETTY HAPSCHATT appear followed by a 
     crowd of friends and well-wishers throwing confetti and shouting 
     excitedly.

     The MINISTER shakes RALPH by the hand while RALPH slips him a $20 bill.

     PHOTOGRAPHERS take pictures.

     BRAD MAJORS, a young slightly awkward, clean-cut American in his mid-
     twenties, comes over the congratulate RALPH.  BRAD and RALPH shake 
     hands.

                         RALPH
               Well Brad, I guess we made it huh!

                         BRAD
               Well I don't think there was any doubt
               about that - You and Betty have been
               almost inseparable ever since you sat
               in on Dr Scott's refresher lectures.

                         RALPH
               Tell you the truth Brad, she was the
               only reason I came in the first place.
               Science was never one of my favourite
               subjects but I sure with Dr Scott
               could have made it today.

                         BRAD
               Yes, Janet and I are both fond of him.
               We drove over to see him last vacation.
               It's a shame his new job took him away
               from Denton.

     BETTY, the bride, throws the bouquet.

     JANET catches it.  She squeals with delight.

     The GUESTS cheer.

                         RALPH
               Hey fella.  It looks like it could be
               your turn next.

                         BRAD
               Who knows...ha ha.

     RALPH & BETTY drive off.  GUESTS wave and shout, BRAD & JANET with great 
     enthusiasm.  GUESTS begin to disperse.

     JANET & BRAD linger outside the church.  So do a strange FAMILY :  An 
     old man with a pitchfork and his wife and daughter.  They resemble the 
     Quaker family in "American Gothic", a painting.

     The MOTHER (MAGENTA) and FATHER (RIFF RAFF) stand outside the church 
     doors.  Their DAUGHTER (COLUMBIA) goes inside.  The FAMILY, and the 
     MINISTER (FRANK N. FURTER), and the GUESTS all resemble characters we 
     shall meet later at the Frank N. Furter place.

                         JANET (who is holding the bouquet)
               Oh Brad, wasn't it wonderful. Didn't
               Betty look radiantly beautiful.  
               Just an hour ago she was plain old
               Betty Monroe.  Now she's Mrs. 
               Ralph Hapschatt.

                         BRAD (Still looking after the car)
               Er...yes, Janet.......Ralph's a 
               lucky guy.  (They start to move d.s.)

                         JANET
               Yes.

                         BRAD
               Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful 
               little cook.

                         JANET
               Yes.

                         BRAD
               And Ralph himself will be in line for 
               promotion in a year or so.

                         JANET
               Yes.

     FIRST CHORD OF "WEDDING SONG"

16     EXT.     CHURCH     DAY

     "WEDDING SONG" (Silent playback for dialogue)

     With great decision BRAD turns on JANET

                         BRAD (spoken)
               Hey Janet.

                         JANET
               Yes Brad.

                         BRAD
               I've got something to say.

                         JANET
               Uh huh.

                         BRAD
               I really loved the skilful way
               You beat the other girls
               To the bride's bouquet.

                         JANET
               Oh Brad.

     (Singing begins)

                         BRAD
               The river was deep but I swam it.

                         FAMILY (Riff & Magenta)
               Janet.

                         BRAD
               The future is ours so let's plan it.

                         FAMILY (R & M)
               Janet.

                         BRAD
               So please don't tell me to can it.

                         FAMILY (R & M)
               Janet.

                         BRAD
               I've one thing to say and that's
               Dammit, Janet.
               I love you.

               The road was long but I ran it.
               (He runs backwards towards church doors)

                         FAMILY (Riff and Magenta)
               Janet.

                         BRAD (Climbing onto fence)
               There's a fire in my heart
               And you fan it.  (Jumps off)

                         FAMILY (Riff and Magenta)
               Janet.

                         BRAD
               If there's one fool for you
               Then I am it.

                         FAMILY (Riff and Magenta)
               Janet.

                         BRAD (Getting chalk from pocket)
               I've one thing to say and that's,
               Dammit, Janet.

     He chalks a heart and arrow on the church door, which Riff Raff proceeds 
     to wipe off.

                         BRAD
               I love you.

     JANET runs to him, he kneels and produces a ring.

                         BRAD
               Here's a ring to prove that
               I'm not joker.

     CHURCH BELLS Peal out.  RIFF & MAGENTA open doors and solemnly enter the 
     church, door closes behind them.

                         BRAD
               There's three ways that love can grow.
               That's good bad or mediocre.

     JANET grabs the ring as BRAD rises.  She throws down the bouquet and 
     would fall into BRAD's arms but he goes to the door to chalk on it 
     again.

                         BRAD
               Oh - J - A - N - E - T
               I love you so.

     JANET, transfixed, bursts into the church.

17     INT. CHURCH          DAY

     "WEDDING SONG"  Pt. 2

     JANET bursts into the church, hypnotised by the ring.  BRAD follows her.

                         JANET
               Oh!......It's nicer than
               Betty Munroe had

                         MAGENTA (Peering up from behind pew)
               Oh Brad.

                         JANET
               Now we're engaged and I'm so glad.

                         MAGENTA & COLUMBIA
               Oh Brad.  (Both peer up and disappear)

                         JANET
               That you met Mom
               And you know Dad.

                         WHOLE FAMILY
               Oh Brad.  (peering up together)

                         JANET (Taking his arm)
               I've one thing to say
               And that's, Brad
               I'm mad,
               For you too.

     BRAD & JANET start to walk d.s., arm in arm.

     the strange FAMILY march slowly across them l/r., in front.

                         JANET (Laying head on Brad's sh.)
               Oh, Brad.

                         BRAD
               Oh Dammit.

                         JANET (Caresses his cheek)

               I love you too-oo-oo.

     BRAD takes JANET's hands, turning to her.  We are aware of THE FAMILY 
     bringing in coffin in b.g. through vestry door.

                         BRAD & JANET
               There's one thing left to do-ah-ooh

                         BRAD (Circling Janet)
               Dammit, Janet.

     JANET circles BRAD twice, admiring her ring on the way.

                         JANET
               Oh Brad,

18     INT.     A STUDY     NIGHT

     Mahogany bookcases, a large desk with a prominent globe of the world.  A 
     well-padded armchair has its back to the camera.  It swings around 
     revealing the NARRATOR.  He is in his smoking jacket.  He speaks 
     directly to us.

                         NARRATOR
               I would like if I may to take you on a
               strange journey.

     He crosses to the bookshelf.  He selects a dossier.  We see the title: 
     "The Denton Affair".  He returns to his desk and places it on a 
     bookstand.  He puts on his reading glasses.

                         NARRATOR
               It seemed a fairly ordinary night when
               Brad Majors and his fiancee Janet Weiss
               (two young ordinary healthy kids) left
               Denton that late November evening to
               visit Dr Everett Scott, ex. tutor and
               now friend of both of them.  It's true 
               there were dark storm clouds, heavy, 
               black and pendulous, toward which they 
               were driving.  It's true also that the

               spoil the events of their evening.

               On a night out.

     He closes the book marking the place.

     Thunder is heard distantly on the sound track.

               It was a night out they were going to
               remember for a very long time.

19     EXT.     NIGHT

     A windscreen wiper working under strain.  Torrential rain on the 
     windscreen.  BRAD concentrating on visibility.  JANET eating chocolates 
     and listening to the car radio playing an Orson Welles serial - The 
     Shadow.

     A motorcycle roars past them.

                         JANET
               Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist
               that's passed us.  They certainly take
               their lives in their hands.  What with
               the weather and all.

                         BRAD
               Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to
               that type.

     JANET takes another stick of gum.

     Offers BRAD some.  He declines.

     The car slows to a halt.

               What's the matter Brad, darling?

     Headlights on sign reading: "DEAD END".

               I think we took the wrong fork a few
               miles back.

                         JANET
               Oh dear!  But then where did the
               motorcyclists come from?

                         BRAD
               Hmmm ... Well, I guess we will have

               But where will you go?  We're in the 
               middle of nowhere.

                         BRAD
               Didn't we pass a castle back down the
               road a few miles?  Maybe they have
               a telephone I might use.

     He unbuckles his seatbelt.

               might be a beautiful woman and you may
               never come back.

               In the velvet darkness
               Of the blackest night
               Burning bright.

     We see the two of them - BRAD striding ahead, JANET nearly catching up 
     with him.

     Behind them on the side of the road, sparse trees and rock formations.

                         JANET
               There's a guiding star
               No matter what or who you are.

     They have passed a row of trees.  A rock formation in the shape of a 
     castle is silhouetted against the sky.  It has a flag flying from the 
     turret.

     Lightning strikes.

     A glow of light appears in a window.  It illuminates a path to the 
     castle.

     BRAD and JANET turn.

     The castle is in the distance between the two of them.

     Taking JANET by the hand, BRAD moves off the roadway towards the house.

                         BRAD
               I can see the flag fly
               I can see the rain

               Just a moment, Janet.  They may have
               a telephone.

     The door opens.  Throbbing music is heard in the background as if there 
     is a party going on in the distance.

     The figure we have seen at the window emerges.  He is a hunch-backed 
     servant, RIFF RAFF.

               Hello.

               Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors.
               And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I -
               ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our
               car has broken down about two miles up the

     vacuuming the stairs.

     JANET steps over the vacuum lead.

               Are you - giving a party?

                         RIFF RAFF
               No.  You've arrived on a rather special
               night.  It's one of the master's affairs.

                         JANET
               Oh, lucky him.

                         MAGENTA
               He's lucky.

     BRAD and JANET look at MAGENTA, surprised by her voice.

               lucky.

40     SONG:          "THE TIME WARP"

     BRAD and JANET are rather unnerved by this outburst from the domestic.  
     They look back to RIFF RAFF.  He is now standing by a set of mirrors 
     reflecting to infinity.

                         RIFF RAFF
               It's astounding
               Time is fleeting
               Madness takes its toll
               But listen closely
               Not for very much longer
               I've got to keep control.

     MAGENTA gives RIFF RAFF a strange signal.

     RIFF RAFF starts to dance in an extraordinary fashion.

                         RIFF RAFF
               I remember doing the Time Warp.

     BRAD and JANET are amazed.

                         RIFF RAFF
               Drinking those moments when
               The blackness would hit me.

     MAGENTA half closes her eyes in pleasure.

     JANET clings to BRAD.

                         RIFF RAFF
               And the void would be calling.

     RIFF RAFF opens a set of double doors marked BALLROOM.

41     INT.     BALLROOM     NIGHT

     BRAD and JANET find themselves on a balcony of a huge black and silver
     ballroom.  At the furthest end is a throne-like chair and, surrounding 
     it, a theatre proscenium.  In the body of the room are GUESTS.  They are 
     the people BRAD and JANET passed on the road.  They are the 
     Transylvanian Secret Agents - assembled on this special occasion from 
     all over the earth.  It is the Annual Transylvanian Convention - 
     announced by an official banner suspended over the Ballroom.  They are
     all dressed in strange but elegant evening wear.  They are a distorted 
     version of the GUESTS from the Denton wedding.  A party spirit prevails, 
     they throw their arms out in a plea to RIFF RAFF on the balcony.

                         GUESTS
               Let's do the Time Warp again.

     JANET falls into BRAD's arms.

     They collide with MAGENTA who has blocked off the corridor with her 
     vacuum.  She sings with menace, waving the cleaner hose dangerously.

                         MAGENTA
               It's so dreamy
               Oh, fantasy free me
               So you can't see me
               No not at all.

     BRAD and JANET look at each other in alarm.

               In another dimension.
                    (she forces them back towards
                    balcony)
               With voyeuristic intention.

     BRAD blushes.

               Well secluded I see all
               With a bit of a mind flip
               You're into the time slip
               Nothing will ever seem the same.

     They are back at the balcony.

               You're spaced out on sensation.

     They are at the edge of the balcony.

               Like you're under sedation.

     They force BRAD and JANET into the Ballroom proper.

               Well I was walking down the street
               Just having a think
               When a snake of a guy
               Gave me an evil wink.
               Well it shook me up
               It took me by surprise
               He had a pick-up truck
               And the devil's eyes
               He stared at me
               And I felt a change
               Time meant nothing

     BRAD and JANET retreat to the hall.  Behind them a lift slowly descends 
     bearing a figure in a black cloak and a diamante stiletto heel - beating
     time to a rhythm the band has started playing.

                         JANET
               Brad, please lets get out of here.

                         BRAD
               For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.

                         BRAD
               It's just a..a party Janet.

               Well I want to leave.

                         BRAD

               They're probably foreigners with ways 
               different from our own.  -  They may

     The figure turns and throws open lift cage door.  As camera zooms in to 
     the death mask above them the film changes from black and white to 
     colour.  However the only colour in evidence is the red lipstick on the 
     mouth of their host.

     SONG:          "SWEET TRANSVESTITE"

                         FRANK
               How do you do.

               I see you've met my faithful handyman.
               He's a little brought down - 
               Because when you knocked
               He thought you were the candyman.

     RIFF RAFF scowls.

               Don't get strung out by the way 
               that I look.

     FRANK strides across the Ballroom to the throne.

                         FRANK
               Don't judge a book by its cover
               I'm not much of a man
               By the light of day
               But by night I'm one hell of a lover.

     JANET gives a silent scream.

     FRANK lets the cloak fall onto the throne, which reveals his 
     transvestite attire.

     The GUESTS scream with delight.

                         FRANK
               I'm just a sweet Transvestite
               From Transexual Transylvania.

     He slowly moves back to BRAD and JANET, doing leg kicks.

               Let me show you around, maybe play you a sound
               You look like you're both pretty groovie.

     He circles them and forces them into the Ballroom.

               Or if you want something visual
               not too abysmal
               We could take in an old Steve Reeves movie.

     BRAD clumsily attempts to circle around FRANK.  FRANK meanwhile ignores 
     him and greets his other guests.

                         BRAD
               I'm glad we caught you at home
               Ah - could we use your phone
               We're both in a bit of a hurry.

     JANET joins BRAD.

                         JANET
               Right!

                         BRAD
               We'll just say where we are
               Then go back to the car
               We don't want to be any worry.

     FRANK turns on them.

                         FRANK
               You got caught with a flat
               Well how about that
               Well babies don't you panic
               By the light of the night
               It'll seem alright
               I'll get you a satanic mechanic.

     FRANK turns his back on BRAD and JANET and splitting the ranks of his 
     GUESTS, departs for the other end of the Ballroom.  Streamers fall.

                         FRANK
               I'm just a sweet transvestite
               From Transexual Transylvania.

     From the throne he gestures towards BRAD and JANET rather slowly over 
     the next verse.

                         FRANK
               Why dont'cha stay for the night

               With blonde hair and a tan
               And he's good for relieving my tension.

     The laboratory is somewhere between a student observation operating 
     theatre and a Greek gymnasium.  It is pink-tiled throughout, facing the 
     lift entrance is a circular area containing a TANK on pedestals which
     though screened at this stage will be revealed to contain the body of 
     ROCKY submerged in chemicals, the wall to one side contains a raised 
     dias area for the GUESTS, and facing one end of the tank, the 
     operational controls, monitor and a giant refrigerator.  A chandelier 
     hangs above the tank.

     On the podium in front of Frank's chambers there is a stand microphone.  
     Near the podium are some weights.  Behind the tank is a vaulting horse.
     These are wrapped in sellophane - Rocky's presents.

     The GUESTS are waiting as the lift arrives.

     FRANK, now in surgeon's outfit stands in the middle of the room.  RIFF 
     RAFF gets out of the lift first, with a glass of champagne which he
     hands to FRANK.

                         FRANK
               Magenta, Columbia, go and assist Riff Raff.

     As he speaks her name each one steps forward out of the lift.  They
     cross to RIFF RAFF behind the tank.

                         FRANK
               I will entertain...ah...

                         FRANK (Taking Janet's hand to kiss)
               Encante....How nice.  (he circles them)
               And what charming underclothes you both have.
               (He takes two dust coats from Riff Raff 
               and hands them to Brad).
               But here, put these on.  They'll
               make you feel less vulnerable.

     MAGENTA & COLUMBIA cross to the podium.

                         FRANK (continues)
               It's not often we receive visitors here.
               Let alone offer them hospitality.

                         BRAD (Moving towards Frank)
               Hospitality!  All we wanted to do was 
               use your telephone.  A reasonable request 
               which you have chosen to ignore.

                         JANET (Hurring after Brad)
               Don't be ungrateful Brad.

                         BRAD (Stepping closer to Frank)
               Ungrateful!

     The room falls silent.  All eyes are on FRANK, waiting for his reaction.  
     A smile breaks on his face.

                         FRANK
               How forceful you are Brad.  Such a 
               perfect specimen of manhood.  So dominant.

     MAGENTA & COLUMBIA laugh.

               You must be awfully proud of him Janet.

                         JANET
               Well, yes I am.

     THE GUESTS oh and ah appreciatively, BRAD laughs, a little embarassed.

                         FRANK
               Do you have any tattoos Brad.

                         BRAD
               Certainly not!

                         FRANK
               Oh well.  How about you.  (He laughs)

     RIFF RAFF has approached behind FRANK, looming over his shoulder.

                         RIFF RAFF
               Everything is in readiness, Master.
               We merely await your word.

     FRANK drinks his champagne then hands RIFF RAFF the empty glass.  RIFF 
     RAFF goes to the control panel and FRANK to the podium

                         FRANK
               Tonight...One, one, one.  Can you hear 
               me at the back?
               Tonight, my unconventional conventionists.

     MAGENTA, COLUMBIA and GUESTS laugh politely.

                         FRANK
               Tonight you are to witness a breakthrough 
               in biochemical research.

     There is a gasp from COLUMBIA, MAGENTA and GUESTS.

                         FRANK
               And paradise is to be mine.

     GUESTS and everybody applaud.  JANET claps too, but BRAD indicates that 
     she shouldn't.

                         FRANK
               It was strange the way it happened.
               One of those quirks of fate really.  
               One of those moments when you seem 
               irredeemably lost:  you panic; you're 
               trapped; your back's against the wall.
               There's no way out, and then suddenly, 
               you get a break.  (He cracks the bones 
               in his hand)  All the pieces seem to 
               fit into place.  What a sucker you'r 
               been. What a fool.  The answer was there
               all the time.  It took a small accident 
               to make it happen.  An accident!

     MAGENTA & COLUMBIA step forward one each side of him.

                         MAGENTA & COLUMBIA (softly)
               An accident.

                         FRANK
               That's how I discovered the secret.
               That elusive ingredient, that spark 
               that is the breath of life.

     GUESTS applaud.

                         FRANK (Moving to tank)
               You see, Brad and Janet, you are fortunate.
               For tonight is the night that my beautiful
               creature is destined to be born.

     Everybody applauds.  FRANK then pulls the cover from the tank.  RIFF 
     RAFF is at the control panel.

70     INT.     LABORATORY     NIGHT

     The tank is revealed.  There is something inside it is immersed in clear 
     fluid.  The GUESTS are astonished.

                         FRANK
               Throw open the switches on the sonic 
               oscillator.

     RIFF RAFF flicks the switch to activate the oscilloscopes in the panel.

                         FRANK
               And step up the reactor power input 
               three more points.

     RIFF RAFF presses a button three times then begins to unwind a wheel.

     FRANK watches excitedly from behind the tank as the chandelier is 
     lowered.  It spurts different coloured liquids into the tank.

     The liquids bubble and change colour.  The thing inside begins to look 
     like a human form.

                         JANET
               Brad...

                         BRAD
               It's alright Janet.

     The liquids drain away.  The form begins to move.

     FRANK climbs the ladder at one end of the tank, RIFF RAFF the other.

     ROCKY HORROR sits up, raises his arms, finally stands upright with both 
     arms outstretched.

     RIFF RAFF removes the bandage from ROCKY's head.  ROCKY looks at RIFF 
     RAFF then at FRANK.  With a gasp he leaps for the chandelier above.

     At the same time RIFF RAFF is down the ladder making for the handle.  He 
     winds up the chandelier and ROCKY.

71     INT.     THE LABORATORY     NIGHT

     SONG:          THE SWORD OF DAMOCLES.

     ROCKY HORROR with only his head unbandaged, is hanging on to the 
     chandelier which RIFF RAFF is winding upwards.

                         ROCKY
               The Sword of Damocles is
               Hanging over my head.

     FRANK runs down the ladder and kicks RIFF RAFF who starts to lower the 
     chandelier.  FRANK climbs up the other steps to meet his creation coming 
     down.  MAGENTA & COLUMBIA cross to the tank.

                         ROCKY
               And I've got the feeling
               Someone's going to be
               Cutting the thread.

               Oh, woe is me.
               My life is a misery.

               Oh, can't you see
               That I'm at the start
               Of a pretty big downer....

     As ROCKY gets level with him, FRANK lunges for him but lands inside the 
     tank....because...

     ROCKY simultaneously abandons the chandelier, lands between MAGENTA and 
     COLUMBIA who now each have a pair of scissors with which they will snip
     his arm and leg bandages.

                         ROCKY
               I woke up this morning
               With a start
               When I fell out of bed.

                         GUESTS (inc. Riff, Magenta & Columbia)
               That ain't no crime.

                         ROCKY
               And left from my dreaming
               Was a feeling
               Of un-nameable dread.

                         GUESTS
               That ain't no crime

                         ROCKY
               My high is low.
               I'm dressed up
               With no place to go.

               And all I know
               Is I'm at the start
               Of a pretty big downer.

     FRANK, in the tank behind ROCKY, puts his arms round ROCKY's neck.  
     ROCKY spins away.  MAGENTA and COLUMBIA hang on to one end of his chest
     bandage so that it undoes as he goes.

                         GUESTS (inc. RIFF RAFF, MAGENTA & COLUMBIA)
               Sha la la la
               That ain't no crime.

                         ROCKY
               Oh, no no, no no.

                         GUESTS
               Sha la la la
               That ain't no crime.

                         ROCKY
               No no no, no no.

                         GUESTS
               Sha la la la
               That ain't no crime -
               That ain't no crime.

     ROCKY is now unbandaged.  He strikes a pose.

     During the last sequence, FRANK climbs out of the tank onto RIFF RAFF'S 
     shoulders and purses ROCKY, but they fall.

72     INT.     STUDY     NIGHT

     NARRATOR reading from book.

                         NARRATOR
               Rocky needed peace of mind.
               He didn't know
               He was doing just fine.

               He was the product
               Of another time.
               And as for feeling down -
               Well that's not a crime.

73     INT.     LABORATORY     NIGHT

     FRANK and RIFF RAFF are recovering from their fall.

     ROCKY makes a circuit of the GUESTS.

                         GUESTS (Riff, Magenta & Columbia)
               That ain't no crime.

                         ROCKY (To first group of guests)
               The sword of Damocles is
               Hanging over my head.

                         GUESTS
               That ain't no crime.

                         ROCKY (To second group)
               And I've got the feeling
               Someone's going to be
               Cutting the thread.

                         GUESTS
               That ain't no crime.

                         ROCKY (To third group)
               Oh, woe is me - 
               My life is a mystery.

               (To fourth group)
               Oh can't you see
               That I'm at the start
               Of a pretty big downer.

     ROCKY set off at a run as FRANK looms up again.

     (FRANK is chasing ROCKY round the lab.)

                         GUESTS
               Sha la la la
               That ain't no crime.

                         ROCKY
               Oh no no no no.

                         GUESTS
               Sha la la la
               That ain't no crime.

                         ROCKY
               No no no no.

                         GUESTS
               Sha la la la
               That ain't no crime.
               That ain't no crime.

                         GUESTS
               Sha la la la
               That ain't no crime.

                         ROCKY
               No no no no.

                         GUESTS
               Sha la la la
               That ain't no crime.

                         ROCKY
               No no no no.

                         GUESTS
               Sha la la la
               That ain't no crime -
               That ain't no crime.

     At the end of number, ROCKY has climbed up the ladder attached to the 
     end of the tank nearest the bridal chambers and FRANK is in a heap 
     below.  RIFF RAFF is behind the tank and MAGENTA and COLUMBIA in their 
     positions in front of it.

74     INT.     LABORATORY     NIGHT

     FRANK picks himself up.  ROCKY is sitting at the top of the ladder above 
     him, with his perfect limbs near Frank's face.

                         FRANK
               Well.  That's no way to
               behave on your first day out.

     ROCKY looks hurt.

               But as you're such an
               exceptional beauty I'm
               prepared to forgive.

     FRANK crosses behind ROCKY to stand next to RIFF RAFF behind the tank.

               I just love success.

                         RIFF RAFF (edging up to Frank)
               He is a credit to your
               genius, Master.

                         FRANK
               Yes.

                         MAGENTA (Moving to tank from controls)
               A triumph of your vill.

                         FRANK
               Yes.

                         COLUMBIA (Who is on opposite side of tank)
               He's o.k.

                         FRANK
               O.K?  (Moving out behind tank towards 
               Janet and Brad)  I think we can do a 
               little better than that.

               You.  (To Janet)  What do you think?

                         JANET
               Well.  (She looks at Brad)  I don't 
               like men with...er, with too many, muscles.

                         FRANK
               I didn't make him for you

     JANET nods hastily.  FRANK moves towards microphone.

               He carries the Charles Atlas seal of 
               approval....And he didn't even take 
               the lessons.

74A     INT.     LABORATORY     NIGHT

     SONG:          CHARLES ATLAS (Pt. 1)

     As FRANK starts to sing, MAGENTA & RIFF RAFF collect one of ROCKY's 
     presents, the vaulting horse, and place it in front of the podium.
     COLUMBIA leads ROCKY down from the ladder.

                         FRANK
               A weakling weighing
               Ninety eight pounds
               Will get sand in his face
               When kicked to the ground.
               And soon in the gym (ROCKY sits on horse)
               With a determined chin
               The sweat from his pores
               As he works for his ca-ha-hause

     MAGENTA & RIFF RAFF now bring the weights.

                         FRANK
               Will make him glisten - thank you -
               And gleam.
               And with massage
               And just a little bit of
               Ste-he-he-he-hem...(laughs)
               He'll be pink.
               And quite clean.

                         FRANK
               He'll be a strong man -
               Oh honey -

                         GUESTS, RIFF, MAGENTA & COLUMBIA & FRANK.
               But the wrong man.

                         FRANK
               He'll eat nutritious high protein
               And swallow raw eggs.
               Try to build up his shoulders,
               His chest, arms and legs.

               Such an effort -
               If he only knew of my plan.
               In just seven days,

                         GUESTS, RIFF, MAGENTA & COLUMBIA & FRANK
               I can make you a ma-aa-a-a-an

     ROCKY throws down the weights and begins press ups.

                         FRANK
               He'll do press-ups and chin-ups,
               Do the snatch, clean and jerk.

     FRANK crosses to JANET & BRAD

               He thinks dynamic tension
               Must be hard work.
               Such strenuous living
               I just don't understand.

     FRANK moves back to ROCKY who is still pressing up.

               When, in just seven days -
               Oh baby...(ROCKY jumps up.)

               I can make you
               A ma-a-a-a-an...(laugh).

75     INT.     LABORATORY: REFRIGERATOR     NIGHT

     The large refrigeration unit door slowly opens, falling like a 
     drawbridge.  Inside is a wall of ice and many CocaCola bottles.
     Through these bursts an icy EDDIE riding a Harley Davidson motor bike, 
     ex World War II, holding a Gibson guitar.

     Several guests are crushed to death.

                         COLUMBIA
               Eddie!

                         EDDIE
               Stay cool baby.

                         JANET
               Who's Eddie?

                         RIFF RAFF
               The delivery boy.

                         MAGENTA
               His delivery wasn't good enough though.

     ROCKY looks terrified.

     JANET has fainted yet again.

     EDDIE comes to life.

76     SONG:          "WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO SATURDAY NIGHT"

                         EDDIE
               Whatever happened to Saturday night
               When you dressed up sharp
               And you felt alright
               It don't seem the same since cosmic light
               Came into my life and I thought I was divine.

     COLUMBIA leaps on to the pillion seat.

               I used to go for a ride with a chick who'd go
               And listen to the music on the radio.

     The MOTORCYCLISTS GUESTS remember only too well.

               A saxophone was blowing on a rock and roll show
               And we climbed in the back
               And we really had a good time

     COLUMBIA rushes to the switchboard, flicks a lighting switch and all the 
     lights above the stairs start changing colour.

     The GUESTS go crazy and rock and roll all over the staircase.

     COLUMBIA dances with EDDIE.

     Even RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA step it out.

                         ALL
               Hot patootie
               Bless my soul
               I really love that rock and roll
               (four times)

     EDDIE (more confident, less frozen) leaps onto the motorbike in a legs 
     apart guitar strumming pose.

     FRANK is getting furious.

     ROCKY is perplexed.

                         EDDIE
               My head used to swim
               From the perfume I smelled.
               My hands kind of fumbled
               With her white plastic belt.
               I'd taster her baby pink lipstick,
               And that's when I'd melt.
               And she'd whisper in my ear,
               Tonight she really was mine.

               Get back in front and put
               Some hair oil on.
               Buddy Holly was singing
               His very last song.
               With your arms around your girl
               You tried to - ah - sing along
               It felt pretty good, whoo.
               Really had a good ti-i-ime.

     EDDIE slips onto the pedal starting the bike.  He takes off and roars 
     round the laboratory, even riding up and down the walls.

                         ALL
               Hot patootie
               Bless my soul.
               I really love that rock and roll.

               Hot patootie
               Bless my soul.
               I really love that rock and roll.

               Hot patootie
               Bless my soul.
               You know I love that rock and roll.

               Hot patootie
               Bless my soul.
               I really love that rock and roll.

     4 bars instrumental (saxophone)

     FRANK steals towards the fridge where he collects an ice pick, 
     innocently.

                                   THAT ROCK AND ROO-AHOUL!

     On the last chorus FRANK rushes to EDDIE with the ice pick, in a 
     demented fury.

     THE GUESTS are unbelieving.

     COLUMBIA covers her face with her hands.

     EDDIE is dead.  FRANK walks away from his body unconcerned.

     JANET screams and screams.

77     INT.     LAB     NIGHT

     DIALOGUE SEQUENCE

     MAGENTA is very bored and picking up ice cubes and placing them in the 
     ice bucket.

                         FRANK
               One from the vaults.

     RIFF RAFF drags EDDIE's dismembered body back into the fridge.

               And so perish all those who reject my love!

     ROCKY cowers in terror.

               Oh no, my little Adonis -
               You're much too beautiful to be destroyed.
               He had a certain naive charm - but no muscle.

     ROCKY flexes.

     FRANK is thrilled.

79     INT.     BRIDAL SUITE     NIGHT

     RIFF RAFF presses a button and a wall opens revealing a bridal suite 
     done out in black silk.

     The GUESTS shout their approval.

     The end of the SONG turns into Mendelssohn's wedding march and FRANK 
     leads ROCKY to his bridal chamber.

     The GUESTS throw confetti.

     BRAD and JANET look at each other in amazement.

80     INT.     STUDY     NIGHT

                         NARRATOR
               There are some people who say that life
               is an illusion, and that reality is simply
               a figment of our imaginations!  If this
               is so, then Brad and Janet are quite safe.
               However, the sudden departure of their
               host and his creation (into the seclusion
               of his sombre bridal suite) had left them
               feeling both apprehensive and uneasy.
               A feeling which grew as the other guests
               'departed' and 'they' were shown to their
               separate rooms.

     RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA by the monitor.

     They switch from channel to channel.

     We see BRAD looking at the TV monitor.

     And JANET sitting on the end of the bed.

     JANET lies back on the bed and switches off her bedside lamp.

     RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA smile at each other.

84     INT.     JANET'S ROOM (RED FILTER)     NIGHT

     Only a soft glow of moonlight from a barred window.  ON the netting
     round her bed.

     There is a knock at the door.

     JANET sits p.

                         JANET
               Who is it?  Who's there?

     BRAD's voice from behind the door.

                         BRAD'S VOICE
               It's only me, Janet.

     She relaxes.

                         JANET
               Oh, Brad, come in, darling.

     A silhouette enters and crosses to the bed.  It moves onto the bed
     behind the net curtain.

                         JANET
               Oh Brad - Mmmm - Oh yes, my darling -
               what if...

                         BRAD
               It's alright Janet.  Everything's going
               to be alright.

                         JANET
               Oh, I hope so my darling.  But let me
               switch on the light.

                         BRAD
               No, don't do that.

                         JANET
               Oh don't be so shy.

     She switches on the light to reveal FRANK.

                         JANET
               YOU!

     FRANK sits up.

                         FRANK
               I'm afraid so, Janet.  But isn't it nice?

     JANET beats his chest with her clenched fists.

                         JANET
               You beast, you monster, what have you
               done with Brad?

                         FRANK
               Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?

                         JANET
               You tricked me - I wouldn't have -
               I've never - never

                         FRANK
               I know.  But it wasn't all bad was it?
               In fact, I think you found it quite pleasurable.
               Mmmmm so soft, so sensual.

     He re-commences making love to her.

                         JANET
               Oh - Oh - no - stop - I mean help.
               I - Brad - Oh.
                    (she shouts)
               Brad.

     FRANK places a finger on her lips.

                         FRANK
               Ssssh.  Brad's probably asleep by now.  
               Do you want him to see you like this?

                         JANET
               Like this - like how?  It's your fault.
               You're to blame.
                    (pause)
               I was saving myself.

                         FRANK
               Well, I'm sure you're not spent yet.

     He switches off the light.

     We see ROCKY chained to the bed sleeping.

     In the background RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA in laboratory.

     ROCKY stirs and makes a sound.

     RIFF RAFF walks across to the door and stares at the sleeping body.

     His eyes are full of hate.

     He looks at MAGENTA.

     She nods to him.

     He releases the chains.

     ROCKY stirs.

     RIFF RAFF picks up a candelabra from the bedside table and taunts ROCKY.

     ROCKY jumps out of the bed, terrified.

     RIFF RAFF pushes the candelabra in his face.

     ROCKY crashes through the laboratory and escapes.

     RIFF RAFF turns to MAGENTA who is now standing in the doorway.

     RIFF RAFF puts down the candelabra and they exchange a strange sign.

     A knock at the door.

     BRAD opens it cautiously.

                    (distraught)
               Oh Brad, it's no good here.  It will
               destroy us.

     BRAD takes her hand.

                         BRAD
               Don't worry Janet, we'll be away
               from here in the morning.  Hmmmm,
               you smell so good.

     He gently lays her down on the bed and attempts to caress her.

                         JANET
               Oh Brad.  Oh no.  Not till after
               the wedding, Darling.

     BRAD sits up.

                         BRAD
               Alright, Janet.  I understand.

     The shadow rolls over.

                         JANET
               Maybe we could try it this way.

                         BRAD

     BRAD switches on the bedside lamp an realises he is making love to
     FRANK wearing a JANET wig.

               You!

                         FRANK
               I'm afraid so, Brad.  But wasn't it nice?

     BRAD grabs FRANK around the throat.

                         BRAD
               Why you - what have you done with Janet?

                         FRANK
               Nothing.  Why do you think I should?

     BRAD lets him go and turns away humiliated.

                         BRAD
               You tricked me.  I wouldn't have -
               I've never - never.

                         FRANK
               I know, but it wasn't all bad was it?
               I think you found it quite pleasurable.
                    (he caresses Brad)
               Oh so soft.  So sensual.

               Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.
                    (shouts)
               Janet.

                         FRANK
               Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now.
               Do you want her to see you like this?

                         BRAD
               Like this.
                    (throwing Frank aside)
               Like how?  It's your fault - you're to
               blame.  I thought it was the real thing.

                         FRANK
               Oh come on, Brad, admit it.  It was
               enjoyable, wasn't it?  There's no crime
               in giving yourself over to pleasure.

                         FRANK (Switches off light)
               Oh Brad, you have wasted so much time
               already.  Janet needn't know, I won't tell her.

                         BRAD
               You promise you won't tell?

               to fight against it.  Her only chance would
               be to ride it out - adapt - and perhaps also

                         DR SCOTT
               Brad!  What are you doing here?

     FRANK releases the electro magnet.

     The wheelchair hits the floor.

                         FRANK
               Don't play games, Dr Scott.  You know
               very well what Brad Majors's doing here.
               It was part of your plan was it not that he,
               and his female, should check the layout
               for you.  Well, unfortunately for you all
               there's to be a change of plans.  I'm sure
               you're adaptable, Dr Scott.  I know Brad is.

     BRAD looks embarrassed and humiliated.

                         DR SCOTT
               I can assure you that Brad's presence
               comes as a complete surprise to me.
               I came to find Eddie.

                         BRAD
               Eddie?  I've seen him.  He's...

     FRANK cuts in quickly.

                         FRANK
               Eddie?  What do you know of Eddie,
               Dr Scott?

                         DR SCOTT
               I happen to know a great deal about a
               lot of things.  You see Eddie happens
               to be my nephew.

                         BRAD
               Dr Scott.

     A stifled gasp is heard from JANET behind the curtain.

     FRANK is surprised.

     FRANK crosses the screen and pulls back the curtain to reveal
     JANET and ROCKY.

                         DR SCOTT
               Janet!

                         JANET
               Dr Scott!

                         BRAD
               Janet!

                         FRANK
               Rocky!

     ROCKY reviles FRANK with a look.  He puts his arm around JANET.

     FRANK is appalled.

                         FRANK
               Listen!  I made you, and I can break
               you just as easily.

     ROCKY is terrified.  He takes his arm away from JANET.

                         FRANK
               That's better.

     A GONG is heard.  MAGENTA comes through the broken tiles.

                         MAGENTA
               Master, dinner is prepared.

     FRANK & RIFF RAFF exchange a look.

                         FRANK
               Excellent.  (moves to Dr. Scott)

               Doctor Scott you can sample the
               speciality of the house - roast
               loin of pork.

     He gives JANET, who is virtually naked, a seering look.

                         FRANK
               Under the circumstances, formal
               dress is to be optional.

     FRANK leads the way to the lift.

                         NARRATOR
               Food has always played a vital role
               in life's rituals.  The breaking of
               bread - the last meal of the condemned
               man - and now this meal.  However
               informal it might appear you can be
               sure there was to be very little
               'bonhomie'.

119     INT.     DINING ROOM     NIGHT

     At the head of a large coffin shaped table sits FRANK.  There is an 
     electric carver on the table in front of him.  The table is laid for 
     dinner and present are JANET & BRAD on FRANK's right, DR. SCOTT opposite 
     him, ROCKY HORROR on Dr. Scott's right and between ROCKY and FRANK, 
     COLUMBIA.  They sit in silence as the double doors open.

     RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA enter.  RIFF RAFF carries a large joint of meat, 
     MAGENTA the wine, both of which they set down at the head of the table.

     RIFF RAFF & MAGENTA pour out the wine and return to the side of FRONT 
     who then rises.

                         FRANK
               A toast to absent friends.

                         ALL
               Absent friends.

     FRANK now proceeds to carve the meat.  Everyone is quiet and only the 
     buzzing of the electric carver is heard.  RIFF RAFF & MAGENTA distribute 
     the slices, then return to their places.

                         DR. SCOTT
               We came here to discuss Eddie.

                         COLUMBIA
               Eddie!

                         FRANK (Silencing her with a gesture)
               It's a rather tender subject....
               Another slice anyone.

     Everybody looks at their food carefully.

     COLUMBIA rises.

                         COLUMBIA
               Excuse me.

     She rushes from from the room with a ghastly cry.

                         DR. SCOTT (turning aside)
               I knew he was in with a bad crowd.  But it
               was worse than I imagined...(He turns back)
               Aliens!

     BRAD & JANET look at each other, then at DR. SCOTT.

                         BRAD & JANET
               Dr. Scott!

                         FRANK
               Go on, Dr. Scott - or should I say
               doctor von Scott.

                         BRAD
               What exactly are you implying?

     FRANK threatens him with the knife.

                         DR. SCOTT
               That's alright Brad.

                         BRAD
               But Doctor Scott...

     DR. SCOTT silences BRAD with a gesture.

120     SONG:          "EDDIE'S TEDDY"

     SCOTT picks up some meat on a fork and regards it.

                         DR. SCOTT
               From the day he was born,
               he was trouble.

               He was the thorn
               In his mutter's side.

               She tried in vain.

     DR. SCOTT produces scrapbook, opening it at a picture of Eddie's mother.

                         DR. SCOTT
               He left home the day she died.


               From the day she was gone
               All he wanted

     DR. SCOTT turns page to a picture of a record of Elvis, singing Teddy 
     Bear.

                         DR. SCOTT
               Was rock and roll,

     He turns the page to porno. magazine.

               Porn.

     He turns page to show an advertisement for Harley Davidson.

               Und a motorbike.

     He turns to a still of Eddie as an addict

               Shooting up junk

     He turns to reveal a newspaper clipping "Thug bashes woman, 66".

               He was a low down
               Cheap little punk.

     Turns the page to Eddie's mug shot.

               Taking everyone for a ride.

     The page turns again revealing the lyrics.

                         ALL

               He didn't like his teddy

     She is lighting the candles on her dressing table.

               Everybody shoved him,
               I very nearly loved him.
               I said, hey listen to me,
               Stay sane inside insanity.
               But he locked the door
               And threw away the key.

     She collapses in tears.

     DR. SCOTT produces the note.

               Which reads.

                         ALL
               What's it say,

     FRANK suddenly pulls away the tablecloth to reveal a glass coffin
     containing the decomposed remains of EDDIE.

142     INT.     DINING ROOM/HALL/STAIRS

     RIFF RAFF & MAGENTA laugh.  JANET screams and runs to ROCKY who hugs 
     her.  BRAD looks shocked.  DR. SCOTT wheels back his wheelchair in 
     disgust, FRANK moves d.s. towards ROCKY.

                         FRANK
               Oh Rocky, how could you!

     JANET runs out, FRANK in pursuit.

     ROCKY smiles wanly.

     Encouraged by this, FRANK smashes JANET across the face with the back of 
     his hand.

                         FRANK
               I'll tell you once,

               I've laid the seed
               It should be all you need.

     BRAD appears, pushing DR SCOTT, in hot pursuit.

               You're as sensual
               As a pencil
               Wound up like an 'E' or first string

     JANET arrives at door of laboratory - she can't open it.

     FRANK arrives face to face.

                         FRANK
               When we made it
               Did ya hear a bell ring?

     The door opens - they fall through.

     The door slams in DR SCOTT's face.

144     INT.     LABORATORY     NIGHT

     JANET rushes in, down the ramp, with FRANK in pursuit.

                         FRANK
               Y'got a block,
               Take my advice.
               You'd better wise up,
               Janet Weiss.

     DR. SCOTT & BRAD arrive in the lift.  FRANK has circled the tank and 
     arrived at the control panel.

                         FRANK
               The transducer (He slams the handle)
               Will seduce yah.

     DR. SCOTT, BRAD & JANET find they are stuck to the floor.

                         JANET
               My feet - I can' move my feet.

                         DR. SCOTT
               My wheels - My God, I can't
               move my wheels.

                         BRAD
               It's as if we were glued to the spot.

                         FRANK
               You are - so quake with fear,
               you tiny fools.

                         JANET
               We're trapped.

                         FRANK (Moving to her)
               It's something you'll
               Get used to.
               A mental mind fuck
               Can be nice.

                         JANET
               Oh!

     FRANK climbs up the ladder beside the tank.

     (music under this dialogue)

                         DR. SCOTT
               You won't find earth people quite
               the easy mark you imagine.  This
               sonic transducer - it is, I suppose,
               some kind of audio-vibratory,
               physiomolecular transport device....

                         BRAD
               You mean...

                         DR. SCOTT
               Yes Brad.  It's something we ourselves
               have been working on.  But it
               seems our friend here has found a
               way of perfecting it.  A device
               which is capable of breaking down
               solid matter and then projecting it
               through space, and - who knows -
               perhaps even time itself!

                         JANET
               You mean he's gonna send us to
               another planet?

     FRANK leaps off the tank to the floor.

                         FRANK
               Planet.

               Schmanet.

               Janet.

     FRANK circles JANET, testing her thighs.  BRAD struggles in vain.

               You'd better wise up,
               Janet Weiss.
               You'd better wise up,
               Build your thighs up.

     JANET screams out.

                         JANET
               Sto-o-o-o-o-op.

     She cried so loudly that FRANK staggers backwards towards the control
     panel.

     RIFF RAFF & MAGENTA enter through the hole in the tiles - they march
     to behind the tank and then the control panel.

                         FRANK (singing)
               Don't get hot and flustered -
               Use a bit of mustard.

                         BRAD
               You're a hot dog
               But you'd better not
               Try to hurt her,
               Frank Furter.

     FRANK signals to MAGENTA.

     BCS MAGENTA's hand on the transducer switch.

     BRAD is turned into a statute.

     DIALOGUE SEQUENCE.

                         COLUMBIA
               My God!  I can't take any more of this - 
               first you spurn me for Eddie, then you 
               cast him off like an old overcoat for 
               Rocky.  You chew people up and then spit 
               them out - I loved you, do you hear me - 
               I LOVED YOU - And what did it get me - 
               I'll tell you - a big nothing.
               You're like a sponge.  You take, take, 
               take, take!  You drain others of their 
               love and emotions.  Well, I've had enough.  
               You've got to choose between me and Rocky - 
               so named because of the rocks in his head.

     FRANK throws a switch, she turns to stone.

                         FRANK
               It's not easy having a good time.

     He crosses over to RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA

               Even smiling makes my face ache.

     RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA nod sympathetically.

     He lies on the operating table.

     They massage.

                         FRANK
               My children turn on me.  Rocky's behaving
               just as Eddie did.  Maybe I made a mistake
               in splitting his brain between the two of
               them.

                         MAGENTA
                    (massaging his temples)
               When will we return to Transylvania?
               I grow weary of this world.

                         FRANK
               Magenta, I am indeed grateful to both
               you and your brother RIff Raff - you have
               both served me well - loyalty such as
               yours must be rewarded and you will
               discover when the mood takes me I can
               be quite generous.

     MAGENTA betrays her resentment by digging her fingernails into his neck.

                         MAGENTA
               I ask for nothing, Master.

     FRANK leaps up from the table.

                         FRANK
               And you shall receive it - in abundance.
                    (he goes to the lift)
               Come.  We are ready for the floor show.
                    (he slams the lift gate)
               Our guests will be growing restless.

     The lift moves downwards.

     Left alone in the laboratory MAGENTA and RIFF RAFF smile at each other.

     They make a special sign and leave by a secret passageway.

                         NARRATOR
               And so, by some extraordinary coincidence - 
               fate it seems had decided that Brad and 
               Janet should keep that appointment with 
               their friend Dr Everett Scott.  But it was 
               to be in a situation which none of them 
               could have possibly foreseen.  And just a 
               few hours after announcing their engagement, 
               Brad and Janet had both tasted forbidden 
               fruit.  This in itself was proof that their 
               host was a man of little morals - and some 
               persuasion.  What further indignities were 
               they to be subjected to?  And what of the 
               sonic transducer and floor show that had 
               been spoken of?  What indeed?  From what 
               had gone before, it was clear that this 
               was to be no picnic.

               But it was over when he had the plan
               To start working on a muscle-man.
               Now the only thing that gives me hope

     We PULL BACK on the whole stage.  The velvets open to reveal the 20th
     Century Fox logo as a stage set.

     At the top of the staircase FRANK appears bathed in light.

     He wears a dazzling version of the national costume and a chiffon cloak
     which billows in the breeze from a wind machine.  He is reminiscent of
     a 30's film star.

                         FRANK
               What ever happened to Fay Wray
               That delicate satin-draped frame
               As it clung to her thigh
               How I started to cry
               For I wanted to be dressed just the same.

     The floor opens to reveal a swimming pool glistening with chlorine
     and glitter.  He beckons the GUESTS.

     In their drugged state they comply with his every wish.


                         FRANK
               Give yourself over to absolutely pleasure
               Swim the warm waters of sins of the flesh
               Erotic nightmares
               Beyond any measure
               And sensual daydreams
               To treasure forever.

     FRANK enters the pool.

               Can't you just see it.
               Can't you just see it.

     They begin to immerse themselves in the pool.

161A               Don't dream it.  Be it.

                         ALL
               Don't dream it.  Be it.

     DR SCOTT animates belatedly.

     He observes the orgy occurring in the pool.

                         DR. SCOTT
               Ach, we've got to get out of this trap
               before this decadence saps our wills.
               I've got to be strong and try to hang
               on.  Or else my mind, may well snap.

     The wind machine blows the blanked from his lap and we see legs, 
     stockings and a suspender belt.  As in a miracle he can walk again.

                         DR. SCOTT
               Und my life will be lived,
               For the thri-i-i-i-ill...

     BRAD surfaces, his face betraying consternation.

                         BRAD
               It's beyond me
               Help me Mo-ommy.

     He is pulled back into the pool.

     A thrilled JANET now emerges.

                         JANET
               God bless Lilly Saint Cyr.

     FRANK breaks through the water on a lift from ROCKY.

               I'm a bee with a deadly sting.

               Your heart'll thump and your blood will sing.
               So let the party and the sounds rock on.

               Rose tint my world
               Keep me safe from my trouble and pain.

     FRANK dives into the pool.

     During the chorus the whole group are diving in and out of the pool in
     a frenetic water ballet.

                         ALL
               I'm a wild and an untamed thing

     They emerge from the pool and form a kick line.

               So let the part and the sounds rock on

     RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA now dressed in military style space suits, face
     FRANK from the opposite end of the ballroom.

     They applaud slowly.

     RIFF RAFF has a ray gun.

     The characters on stage freeze - terrified.

     It's a showdown across the ballroom.

               It's all over

     FRANK looks stunned.

               Your life style's too extreme.

     FRANK is guilt-stricken.

               I'm your new Commander.
               You are now my prisoner.

     The GUESTS scramble for the safety of the wings.

     footlight controls to give him what effects he requires.

     The others help FRANK out by singing from the wings.  COLUMBIA operates
     a spotlight.

164     INT.     BALLROOM     NIGHT

     MAGENTA who during all this has been filing her nails, looks up at FRANK
     who is in an attitude of supplication.

                         MAGENTA
               How sentimental.

     RIFF RAFF moves slowly to the stage.

                         RIFF RAFF
               And also presumptuous of you.  You
               see when I said "we" were to return
               to Transylvania, I referred only to
               Magenta and myself.

     FRANK looks appalled.

     The GUESTS are deeply troubled, realising that they also are not part of
     the "We".

                         RIFF RAFF
               You see, you are to remain here,
               in spirit anyway.

     He produces a ray gun.

                         DR SCOTT
               Great Heavens, that's a laser.

                         RIFF RAFF
               Yes, Dr Scott.  A laser capable of
               emitting a beam of pure anti-matter.

                         BRAD
               You mean you're going to kill him?
               What's his crime?

                         DR SCOTT
               You saw what became of Eddie.
               Society must be protected.

                         RIFF RAFF
               Exactly, Dr Scott.  Now Frank N.
               Furter, your time has come.  Say
               goodbye to all this and hello to oblivion.

     FRANK raises himself to his full height.

                         FRANK
               Do your worse - inferior one.

     As RIFF RAFF pulls the trigger, COLUMBIA dashes between them.

     She is killed instantly.

     RIFF RAFF fires again at FRANK.

     FRANK takes a leap fro the rope on the curtain.  The entire proscenium 
     crashes under the weight.  And FRANK is crushed to death among the
     velvet and glittered facia.

     ROCKY breaks down completely.  Although he despised FRANK, he was all he
     had in the world.

     He rushes to the body and cradles it in his arms.

     RIFF RAFF can stand no more.

     He fires a blast of laser beam at ROCKY who starts climbing the stairway
     towards the fox skyline.

     RIFF RAFF fires again and again.

     With the body of FRANK in his arms, ROCKY beats on his chest and lets
     out a wild sound like a giant beast of the jungle.

     RIFF RAFF fires a sustained beam.

     ROCKY climbs to the top of the Fox sculpture.

     RIFF RAFF fires again and again.

     They crash to their deaths.

                         BRAD
               Good God.

                         RIFF RAFF
               Yes.

                         JANET
               You've killed them.

     MAGENTA has found the entire sequence of events quite distasteful.

                         MAGENTA
               I thought you liked them.  They liked you.

                         RIFF RAFF
               They didn't like me.  They never liked me.

                         DR SCOTT
                    (he tries a calming hand)
               You did right.

                         RIFF RAFF
               A decision had to be made.

                         DR SCOTT
                    (the big sell-out)
               You're OK by me.

                         RIFF RAFF
               Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.

                         DR SCOTT
               Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.

                         RIFF RAFF
               You must leave now Dr Scott while it's
               still possible.  We are about to beam
               the entire house back to the planet of
               transexual in the galaxy of Transylvania.
               Go now.

     The GUESTS flee down the ballroom and out the door.

     We see the laughing figures of RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA making a special
     sign to each other.

                                        CUT TO

165     INT.     CASTLE CORRIDORS     NIGHT

     We see BRAD and JANET fleeing with DR SCOTT following behind.

165A     INT.     BALLROOM     NIGHT

     RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA's laughter has subsided.

                         RIFF RAFF
               Our noble mission is almost completed my
               most beautiful sister, soon we will return
               to the moon-drenched shores of our
               "androgenous" planet.

                         MAGENTA
               Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night -
               to sing and dance once more to your dark
               refrains.  To take that step to the right...

                         RIFF RAFF
               But it's the pelvic thrust
               that really drives you insane.

                         MAGENTA
               And our World will do
               the Time Warp again.

165B     EXT.     CASTLE     DAWN

     There is a huge explosion.

166     EXT.     CASTLE     DAWN

     We see the entire castle surrounded by a giant beam of light and then
     vanish into space.

     During the explosion sequence the film reverts optically to black and
     white.

                                        DISSOLVE TO

167     EXT.     THE CRATER     DAY

     SONG:          "SUPER-HEROES"

     BRAD, JANET, and DR SCOTT's bodies are scattered on three sides
     surrounding a crater where the castle once was.

     The scene is arid and deserted.  There are remnants of DR SCOTT's
     wheelchair, EDDIE's coffin and broken objects from the laboratory.

     BRAD, tattered and bleeding, lifts himself up.

                         BRAD
               I've done a lot
               God knows I've tried
               To find the truth I've even lied
               But all I know is down inside.

     DR SCOTT drags himself to his knees.

                         BRAD & DR SCOTT
               I'm bleeding.

                         JANET
                    (revives)
               And super heroes
               Come to feast
               To taste the flesh
               Not yet deceased
               And al I know
               Is still the beast

                         TRIO
               Is feeding.

     The three of them stand shakily on the perimeter of the crater.

     All that is left is dust and sand and wind and the sun.

     The CAMERA PANS from face to face in a circular movement getting faster
     and faster as the trio sing a chorale of hopelessness.

168     INT.     STUDY     NIGHT

     The CAMERA has spun into a blur but focusses on a spinning globe
     of the earth on the NARRATOR's desk.

     The NARRATOR puts his hand on the globe, stopping it.

     He is standing over his lectern reading from his book like a preacher
     in a pulpit.

                         NARRATOR
               And crawling on the planet's face
               Some insects called the human race
               Lost in time, and lost in space
               And meaning.

     He turns and goes to the door of the study.

     He switches off the light.

                         VOICES OFF
               Meaning.

     He leaves the study, shutting the door.

     It's almost dark in the study.  Only a sinister glow inside the globe
     of the earth remains.

169     CREDIT SEQUENCE

     SONG:          "SCIENCE FICTION, DOUBLE-FEATURE"

     The cast credits roll up.

                         VOICE OVER
               Science Fiction - double-feature
               Frank has built and lost his creature
               Darkness has conquered Brad and Janet
               The servants gone to a distant planet
               Oh - at the late night double-feature
               Picture Show - I want to go - Ohh -
               To the late night double-feature picture show.

                    -----------------------------
                    THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW
                    -----------------------------

                         Script Amendments               September 12, 1974
                         -----------------

The following alterations involve discrepancies between the original 
screenplay and current script revisions and design decisions.

1/2     The film will now commence in Black and White on "ACADEMY"
     format.  It will extend to wide screen (1.1 - 85) at
     Sequence 41, while still remaining in black and white.  At
     Sequence 54 the film changes to colour.

15     Now read "Denton Episcopalian Church".

23     Brad and Janet will arrive at the gate entrance to Oakley Court.
     This deletes a later reference to gates in 33.  From hereon ignore
     all references to rock formations etc., as the grounds of
     Oakley Court are the only location involved in the approach to the
     house.

25     Three motorbikes drive past Brad and disappear around the house.

26     This window will be in turret in Oakley Court.  Ignore all
     references to adjoining 'massive lighted window'.

30     This shot will be of a Gryphem on the Oakley Court facade.

32     This will be of some similar detail to the above.

38     "Stairway" references now allude to the front entrance hall of
     Oakley Court.

40     Delete references to "mirrors reflecting to infinity".

47     Columbia now is astride a Juke Box.  The band are cut.

54a     Red streamers and Black and White balloons fall.  Not just
     streamers.

69     All future references to the operating table in the Lab now
     should be applied either to the TANK or the vaulting horse
     (part of the gymnasium equipment) - whichever is applicable.

75     Delete references to the Ice-block.  Eddie now crashes
     through a wall of Coca Cola bottles and ice.  He is also equipped
     with a saxaphone rather than a guitar.

87a     Rocky now escapes through the lift shaft.  This may involve
     a shot from the vestibule showing Rocky climbing out of lift
     cage and running out of the house.  It may also involve the
     double bed in the bridal suite collapsing during the escape
     sequence.

91     It is still raining.

92     Janet is now stumbling around the staircase in Oakley Court.

103     This sequence may now also involve Riff-Raff, Magenta,
     Columbia, Frank, Brad and selected Transylvanians.

106     Will now have Frank, Riff-Raff, and Brad entering the Lab
     in the lift cage.

108     It is still raining.

116     Dr Scott will now break through the tiled wall of the laboratory
     on the area of ramp above the control panel.

117     Magenta will now appear through the broken tile area created
     by Dr Scott.

122/140 This sequence will be altered to Dr Scott holding a
     photograph album containing a still photograph equivalent
     of the "flashbacks" referred to in this sequence.

143/4     All entrances to the Lab will be via the broken tiled entrance.

     Delete all references to the floor lowering.

147     The "secret passage" is now the broken tile entrance.

164     Frank tries to scale up the silver drapes which descend on
     him with Tab tracks, rope supports, etc.

MEMO:  SCRIPT ALTERATIONS

FROM:  JIM SHARMAN                    9.12.74

TO:    ALL CONCERNED.


Sc. 148  INT. NARRATOR'S STUDY.N>

As scripted up to;  What further indignities were they
to be subjected to?

Then please add:     And what of the floor show that had been
spoken of?  In an empty house?  In the middle of the night.
What diabolical plan had seized Frank's crazed imagination?
What indeed?  From what had gone before it was clear that
this was to be no picnic.


Sc. 97.  INT. NARRATOR'S STUDY.  N.

Is replaced by the following:

Emotion is a powerful and irrational master, and, from what
Magenta and Columbia eagerly viewed on their television
monitor there seemed little doubt that Janet was indeed it's
slave.


SC. 77 pt.

C.S. FRANK                    FRANK
               Oh no my baby - don't be upset -
               it was a mercy killing.  He had
               a certain naive charm - but no muscle.
