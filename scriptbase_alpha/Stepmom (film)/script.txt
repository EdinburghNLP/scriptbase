     INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

     A billowy white screen.  An alarm clock BLARES.  As MAIN TITLES
     BEGIN, the lovely sleeping face of RACHEL KELLY rolls into frame.
     Then out of it.  Alarm keeps BLASTING.  Back she comes, pulling the
     sheets OVER her head.  Motionless now, as we hear...

     ... the DEAFENING SILENCE of the alarm shutting off.  A beat.
     Rachel SITS BOLTS UPRIGHT.  LEAPS out of the room.  From the back
     we see that she's dressed only in a pair of men's boxers.

     She makes it halfway down the hall, does a U TURN back into the
     bedroom, frantically YANKS a robe hanging from the door, taking the
     wall hook WITH her.  She FLINGS her robe on as she RUNS down the
     hall, wall hook STICKING OUT of her back.  BURSTING INTO...

     INT. BEN'S ROOM - EARLY MORNING

                    RACHEL
          Ben!  You overslept again damn it!

     The room looks like a 6 (but I'm almost 7) year old exploded.
     Posters of MAGICIANS on all the walls.  Rachel darts about the room
     mismatching the clothes she forgot to arrange the night before.

                    RACHEL
          Get Up Get Up Get Up!

     The LUMP under the cover doesn't move.

                    RACHEL
          Ben you're late.  I'm serious.  I'm
          wearing a very serious face.  Don't
          make me start counting ONE...

     No movement.  Rachel tugs the sleeve of a shirt hanging on a chair,
     and out comes a magician's bouquet of FLOWERS.

                    RACHEL
          TWO.

     She pulls a dirty handkerchief out of the pocket of the shirt --
     it's an endless MAGICIAN'S HANDKERCHIEF.

                    RACHEL
          Don't make me say three I'm about to
          say three.
               (a beat, then)
          Three!

     She RIPS the covers off and a blow-up DINOSAUR sleeps in Ben's
     place.

                    RACHEL
          Ben I'm not kidding around.  You make
          yourself appear this instant!

     A WHITE BUNNY saunters across her toes.  Rachel SCREAMS -- then
     gathers her wits and searches under the bed -- under the bureau --
     she opens the closet doors and shoving clothes aside.

                    RACHEL
          You might think this is funny but this
          is actually NOT funny.

     Unseen by Rachel, six-year-old BEN sits, perched on the highest
     closet shelf, knees under his chin, holding his breath.  His eyes
     gleeful as Rachel frantically closes the closet door.

     INT. HALLWAY - EARLY MORNING

     Rachel hops over the Bunny, navigates through strewn toys and books
     STUBBING her baby toe.  She limps in agony past a big picture of
     the kids with their daddy and heads towards a door with a KEEP OUT
     EVERYONE! sign.

                    RACHEL
               (bellowing)
          ANNABELLE!  WAKE UP!

     ANNABELLE'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

     ANNABELLE, 10 years old, sits on the edge of her bed, fuming, all
     of her limbs crossed.  She holds up a filthy purple tee shirt.

                    ANNABELLE
          You forgot to wash my purple shirt.  I
          told you a hundred times it was Purple
          Day at school today.

                    RACHEL
          I didn't forget.  I was up all night 
          thinking about it and I concluded you're 
          too special to look like everyone else.
               (she grabs an orangey 
                red tee shirt)
          Orange Red.  That's your color.  Few 
          can carry it off.  Now please.  Help 
          me find your brother.

                    ANNABELLE
          You lost Ben?!

                    RACHEL
          Of course not.  Does he look lost to 
          you?
               (big breath)
          BENNNNN!!!

     INT. SUBURBAN EXTREMELY WELL-STOCKED KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING

     Rachel, smoking a cigarette and drinking a diet coke, FLINGS open
     pantry doors, closet doors -- looking for Ben -- attempting to put
     stone hard butter on toast at the same time.  She glances at the
     clock -- 7:55.  Oh dear.  Annabelle sits at the table, in a grumpy
     orangey red mood.  Rachel hands her what was once a piece of toast.

                    ANNABELLE
          No.  I told you.  I like apple butter
          not butter butter.

                    RACHEL
               (hands her an apple)
          Here.

                    ANNABELLE
          Never mind.  I'll just eat my lunch.

                    RACHEL
               (forgot)
          I'm almost done making it.
               (to the non-existent Ben)
          Alright Ben -- you deal with the tardy,
          you write yourself a note, your daddy
          told you he had an important case this
          morning and he had to leave early and 
          we were AAAAGGGGHHHH!

     She has opened a cupboard with a Lazy Susan that turns revealing
     BEN sitting there.  Rachel screams AGAIN!

                    RACHEL
          Oh my God.  That is so not funny.  You're
          late.  You're really late.  Now get out
          here and have some cereal.

                    BEN
          No.

                    RACHEL
          Fine!  Eat in the cupboard.

     She hands him a bowl of sugared cereal -- puts two spoonfuls of
     instant coffee in Barney cup, and sticks it under the faucet.

                    BEN
          No!  Cocoa Puffs on Top -- Fruit Loops
          on the bottom.

                    RACHEL
          Fine.

     Rachel grabs the bowl, turn it UPSIDE DOWN on the table reversing
     the order of the cereal.  She SWEEPS it back in the bowl and
     quickly hands it back to him, the phone RINGS THROUGHOUT...

                    BEN
          You touched it.

                    RACHEL
          Then have a donut --

                    BEN
          No.

                    RACHEL
          Alright starve.

                    ANNABELLE
          I'm gonna beep daddy at work.

                    RACHEL
          He's badgering a witness.  Eat.

                    BEN
          But you told us to starve.

                    RACHEL
               (picking up phone)
          Hello?...Duncan...The Ad Agency's
          already there?...I'm out the door...
               (Ben flings a fruit loop
                at her)
          Ben!  Knock it off!
               (into phone)
          It's gonna go beautifully...
               (another fruit loop)
          Damn it Ben --

     Rachel runs around absentmindedly loading out leftover pizza, 
     Hoho's, and Chips.  She glances at the clock again -- 8:00.

                    ANNABELLE
          You swore.  You owe me a quarter.  Did
          you remember my egg carton?  I told
          you I needed my egg carton for seed
          planting today.

                    RACHEL
          Absolutely Duncan I'm on top of
          everything.

     Rachel takes the eggs from the fridge, and dumps them -- accidentally
     missing the sink.  They SHATTER onto the floor.  She hands the empty
     carton to Annabelle.

                    RACHEL
          ...EGGzactly.  I'm putting on my coat --
               (she hangs up, panicked)
          We are late.  We are seriously late.  Which
          means Mister Ben we've got to get you 
          dressed --

                    BEN
          No!

     Ben races away but Rachel LUNGES And CATCHES him.  He wiggles in
     her arms as she struggles to change his clothes.  Just as she gets
     his bottoms off she drops his clothes in the pile of gooey eggs
     when we hear a loud KNOCKING at the kitchen door.  Holding a half
     naked Ben in her arms, Rachel looks up at...

     JACKIE HARRISON.  An immaculately dressed, intimidatingly intel-
     ligent, utterly beautiful woman staring at her with extreme
     disapproval.

                    ANNABELLE AND BEN
          Mommy!

     Annabelle and Ben RACE into their mother's arms like little angels.
     Jackie shoots a fiercely protective glare at Rachel.  They LOCK
     eyes.  Enough wattage to light up all of Manhattan.

     EXT. RACHEL'S LOFT, SOHO - MORNING

     Jackie and the kids exit Rachel's building, onto a bustling Soho
     street.  The kids clamber into the double-parked Volvo wagon.
     Jackie, still pissed, climbs behind the wheel.  Drives off.

     INT. JACKIE'S VOLVO STATION WAGON - EARLY MORNING

     Jackie drives the children down a tree-lined street in Englewood,
     New Jersey.  Ben is banging Jackie's sunglasses case against the
     window.

                    JACKIE
          ...it's really not so bad Annabelle -- Red
          and Blue make purple.

                    ANNABELLE
               (yes she does)
          I don't care.

                    JACKIE
          I know you don't, but if you had, chrom-
          atically you are in the purple family.

     Jackie fishes through her purse.  Finds a toy airplane for Ben.  He
     stops banging her glasses case, starts banging the plane.

                    BEN
          Why does Rachel wear Daddy's underpants?
          Doesn't she have underpants of her own?

                    JACKIE
          I noticed a whopping pile of laundry
          sitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's
          underpants are in there -- Now where are
          your lunches?

     As if by rote, they hold out their lunches.  One is a plastic Vons
     bag and the other a crumpled Macy's bag.  She collects them and
     hands Ben and Annabelle two brightly colored lunch bags.

                    BEN
          Annabelle sucked her thumb last night.

                    ANNABELLE
          I NEVER do that, you ALWAYS lie!

     And SLUGS him.

                    JACKIE
          Never say 'never' -- it's not fair to
          say 'always' -- and no name calling.
          Use your words.

                    ANNABELLE
          I hate when you say that.

                    JACKIE
          Thank you.  Those were all words.  I
          hate the planet Uranus.  Terrible name
          for a planet.

     Annabelle and Ben look up at her curiously.

                    JACKIE
          I hate snails and blue cheese.
          Especially together.  Hate.

                    BEN
          I have lava.

                    JACKIE
               (reflects)
          Lava's hateable.  I never thought of
          that.

                    ANNABELLE
          I hate overly ripe bananas -- they make
          me want to throw up.

                    JACKIE
          Excellent point.

                    BEN
          I hate wax lips and red ants and
          pretzels without salt...

                    ANNABELLE
          I hate the crayon Burnt Sienna and
          people who spit when they walk.

     Jackie nods sagely.  Pulls up next to a school playground.

                    JACKIE
          I hate to say goodbye.  Eskimo Kiss.
               (they rub noses)
          Russian Orthodox Wedding Kiss.

     They bump foreheads and elbows.  Ben runs toward the kindergarten
     playground; Jackie watches concerned as Annabelle climbs the steps.
     The only orangey red dot in a sea of purple.

     EXT. PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO, TRIBECA - MORNING

     Taxi pulls up to a converted warehouse.  Rachel BOLTS out, 
     SPRINTING for the door.

     INT. PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO - DAY

     Black and white FILLS the frame.  Like a checkerboard.  We PULL
     BACK and realize we are seeing a group of PENGUINS waddling against
     a black and white backdrop.  We see a WHITE WAITRE'D in a BLACK
     TUXEDO holding glasses on a tray.  A BLACK MODEL, IMAN, in a WHITE
     DRESS glides through it all.

     In the center the only dash of color is Rachel -- who has just
     entered and starts expertly directing the action.  She calls out to
     her assistant, COOPER.  Perpetually hip.  Perpetually young.

                    RACHEL
          Cooper, back the fill off I don't have
          enough shadow...

                    COOPER
          You've got a fruit loop in your hair.

                    RACHEL
          You say that like I don't know that.

                    COOPER
          I once threw an entire bowl of jello
          on my stepmother's head --

                    RACHEL
          And when did that pass?

                    COOPER
          Actually, never.  They'll always hate
          you.  There's a gene for it.

     DUNCAN SAMUELS -- Rachel's boss, an elegant, edgy, Englishman
     interrupts them.

                    DUNCAN
          Congratulations.  Only forty minutes
          late.  You're handling this promotion
          really well Rachel.

                    RACHEL
          Duncan.  My work is everything to me.
          This'll never happen again.  Now stand
          back -- this session's gonna make you
          remember why you hired me even though
          I wouldn't sleep with you -- Cooper
          let's get these penguins dancing --

     Duncan backs off, charmed by her ballsiness.  The music BLARES just
     then, and a penguin JUTS forward and NIPS the model.  The FLASH of
     the camera.  We FREEZE for a second, seeing the photo Rachel just
     took.  An Avedonesque portrait of a model being GOOSED by a penguin
     COLLIDING with a maitre'd who SPILLS his tray and the penguins seem
     to be POINTING and LAUGHING uproariously.  It's an inspired photo.

     INT. SCHOOL COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - 2:30 THAT DAY

     Jackie and LUKE HARRISON -- ruggedly handsome man, mid-forties,
     charming, disarming, and smart as they come.  They sit side by side
     on a couch across from RUTH FRANKLIN, an Elementary School Counselor

                    MRS. FRANKLIN
          Mr. and Mrs. Harrison, while change is
          exhilarating for adults, it can be 
          quite challenging for a child.

     Luke's beeper beeps.  He ignores it; focuses on Mr. Franklin.

                    LUKE
          I won't get that...It's fine.  Change.
          we were talking about change.

                    MRS. FRANKLIN
          The fact that you two are remarrying
          obviously has Annabelle overjoyed...
               (they look at her,
                dumbfounded)
          And she's very excited about your move to
          Switzerland.

                    JACKIE
          She said we're getting remarried?

     Suddenly -- a long bell rings -- Jackie STANDS UP, startled.

                    MRS. FRANKLIN
          Only a fire drill.  My concern is that
          Annabelle seems apathetic towards her
          work knowing she's leaving before the
          end of the semester.

                    JACKIE
          Mrs. Franklin we're not --

                    LUKE
          Planning on getting --

                    JACKIE
          Remarried.  There is no move.

                    MRS. FRANKLIN
               (trying to appear unfazed)
          Really?  Well then my concern for --

     Luke's beeper BEEPS again.  They talk right over Mrs. Franklin...

                    JACKIE
          Are you here?

                    LUKE
          I'm here.

                    JACKIE
          Because you don't really seem here.

                    LUKE
          I'm here.  I've got a case where they're
          this close to sequestering the jury but
          have I answered the goddamn thing?!

                    JACKIE
          Something's up wi...

                    LUKE
          You think I didn't get that?

     She cuts a look at Mrs. Franklin.

                    JACKIE
          Excuse him.  He never learned how
          to turn the darn thing off.

     And reaches.  Does it for him.

                    MRS. FRANKLIN
          I'm wondering if there's anything going
          on at home that could be intensifying
          Annabelle's need to create this fantasy?

     Long pause.  Then suddenly they both start speaking AT ONCE.

                    LUKE
          I've been with someone for quite some
          time, and didn't feel it was appropriate
          for her to move in too quickly.  But
          after a lot of thought and careful
          discussion with her -- and the kids I
          might add -- she moved in last month.

                    JACKIE
          Since our divorce Luke has seen a
          number of different women in three
          short years and without a lot of
          warning for the kids, he's now living
          with a woman half his age --

                    LUKE
          Rachel's not half my age.

                    JACKIE
          We're not discussing your age.

                    LUKE
          Well, we're not discussing Rachel's
          age either.

                    JACKIE
          They want to be with you Luke, they go
          to your house to be with their father.

                    LUKE
          Jackie, they come to be part of my
          life.  Rachel is part of that life.

                    MRS. FRANKLIN
          Mr. Harrison, I hear you talking about
          your life, your needs, but are you
          really in touch with what Annabelle
          needs?

                    JACKIE
               (suddenly fierce)
          This man would walk thru fire for
          Annabelle, gladly, any day of the week.

                    LUKE
          Napalm.

                    JACKIE
          Except for last Thursday when Rachel
          forgot to pick them up --

                    LUKE
          Jackie, she was five minutes late --

                    MRS. FRANKLIN
          I'm wondering if Annabelle is responding
          to the underlying hostility that exists
          between Rachel and Mrs. Harrison...

                    LUKE
          Of course she's responding to it.  You
          think it's easy for any of us?  You think
          it's easy for Jackie to watch her kids
          being looked after by someone who has
          half the experience she does?  Of course
          she's going to be hostile, irrational,
          and defensive.

                    JACKIE
          Thank you Luke.

     Mrs. Franklin doesn't quite know what to say.  The bell RINGS.

                    LUKE
          Thank you Mrs. Franklin.  Jackie?
               (they get up)
          This has been very valuable for us.  And
          I'll have a serious talk with Annabelle
          tonight.

                    JACKIE
          It's Wednesday night.  She's at my
          house.  I'll talk to her.

                    LUKE
          I'll call from work.  We can have a
          conference call.

                    JACKIE
          You tried that last week and we were
          on hold forty-five minutes...

     And they're out the door.  You can hear the fight as it echoes down
     the elementary school hallway.

     EXT. SCHOOL, ENGLEWOOD, NEW JERSEY - MOMENTS LATER

     Jackie and Luke exit the pleasant suburban school.  Head for the
     parking area...

                    LUKE
          You ask me that counselor's making
          a mountain out of a molehill...

                    JACKIE
          I'm worried.

                    LUKE
          Me too.

                    JACKIE
          Luke, I need to switch next Friday for
          Thursday, so why don't you take the
          weekend...
               (pointedly)
          ...that way you'll be there, and I'll
          pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

                    LUKE
          Fine.  But I wanted to take the kids
          to work with me on Wednesday so I'll
          take Wednesday, and you can pick up
          that Thursday, Friday after soccer,
          and Saturday before riding.

                    JACKIE
          Easy enough.

                    LUKE
          Good...Well...Take care.

     As if on automatic pilot they move in to kiss each other goodbye
     then stop.  Each takes a step back.  15 years of hellos and
     goodbyes.  A beat.  A wave.  They head their separate ways.

     EXT. JACKIE'S HOME - NIGHT

     Establishing shot of Jackie's lovely home on its lovely street.
     Old trees.  Comfortable front lawns.  Safe and happy.  A place to
     grow kids, dogs, probably walruses, even.  We PUSH toward the warm
     glow from within this home...

     INT. JACKIE'S HOME - NIGHT

     Jackie setting the table.  Annabelle recording the moment with her
     omnipresent VIDEO CAMERA...

                    ANNABELLE
          I didn't say that.  Why would I say
          that?

                    JACKIE
          Well Daddy and I were thinking that
          sometimes people tell a story about
          what they wish would happen.

                    ANNABELLE
          I don't want that to happen.  Why
          would I want that to happen?

                    JACKIE
          Well you're telling your teachers and
          your friends --

                    ANNABELLE
          Mass hysteria.

                    JACKIE
          Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.

                    ANNABELLE
          I'm not upset.  Why would I be upset?

                    JACKIE
          Look if the truth is you don't feel like
          talking about this right now that's fine.
          But don't look me in the eye with a big
          smile on your face and lie to me.
          Cause there are only so many lies you're
          allowed to tell before it starts showing
          on your face.  You wind up looking like...

     She stops.  It's just too horrible.

                    ANNABELLE
          Like who?

                    JACKIE
          Well, he's not president anymore, so
          why be petty.

     Ben enters in white gloves and Jackie's scarf.

                    BEN
          Pick a card.  Any card.

     Jackie picks a card.

                    ANNABELLE
          It just slipped out.

                    JACKIE
          It happens.

                    ANNABELLE
               (a beat)
          What happens when he loves Rachel more
          than us?

                    JACKIE
          That will never happen.

                    ANNABELLE
          Never say never you always say that.
          I'll bet daddy's mad at me now.

                    BEN
          Queen of diamonds.

                    JACKIE
          Seven of clubs.  Nobody's mad we just
          want to talk about it.

                    ANNABELLE
          I'm gonna call him.

                    JACKIE
          Annabelle, daddy and I will always be there.
          That's one time always is always.  You
          can call him after dinner but...

     Annabelle RUNS out of the room.  Jackie watches her sadly.  Ben
     hits Jackie hard with his magic wand.

                    BEN
          Poof!  You're happy now.

                    JACKIE
          Thank you Ben.
               (unhappily)
          Annabelle!

     Ben finds himself alone in the kitchen.  He hits himself on the
     head, hard.  Poof!  He begins to serve himself dinner.  Alone.

     EXT. RESTAURANT, SOHO - NIGHT

     Rachel and Luke exit a neighborhood bistro.  Stroll down the
     street...

                    RACHEL
               (irritated)
          Okay, if they're going to have a
          sauce, put something in it besides
          flour and chicken broth...

                    LUKE
               (quietly)
          It was a veal stock, I thi...

                    RACHEL
          Well, it wasn't a reduction like
          you do it!  Boiling down half a
          ton of bones...

     Luke is thinking of something.  She's watching that.

                    RACHEL
          The way you cook.  If you could
          make love, I'd marry you.

                    LUKE
               (softly)
          We have to talk.

                    RACHEL
               (happy)
          Uh-oh.  I mention marriage, all
          of a sudden...
               (ominous Nazi Baritone)
          Ve haff to ta...

                    LUKE
          I didn't want to spoil our supper...

                    RACHEL
          You'd rather spoil our walk home.

                    LUKE
          Yeh, it's cheaper.

     Okay, what?

                    LUKE
          I just found out I have to go to
          Boston to get a deposition.  I might
          not be back until Saturday.

                    RACHEL
               (mock horror)
          So I'll have to order in?

                    LUKE
               (dropping the other shoe)
          We have the kids this weekend, so...

                    RACHEL
               (softly)
          Jesus.

     He glances over...

                    RACHEL
          I thought it was her weekend.  Do I
          ever see you alone?

     He draws a breath.  The concern is behind his eyes.

                    LUKE
          Anyway, I thought...while I'm
          gone...maybe I'll hire in some help.

                    RACHEL
          For what?

                    LUKE
          Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're
          working...

                    RACHEL
          I can take them to work with me -- I
          can shift things around --

                    LUKE
          You don't need to.  I don't expect you
          to handle them yourself.

                    RACHEL
          Can't handle them myself is what you
          mean.  Can't.

     Maybe she's right.  Because he doesn't say anything.

                    RACHEL
          You don't trust me to be alone with
          them.

                    LUKE
          I trust you of course I do but -- 

                    RACHEL
          But?  But what?

                    LUKE
          But you're not good at this.  Not yet.
          I'm sorry.

                    RACHEL
          I know how responsible, caring adults
          parent children.  I'm bribe 'em.  But
          'em a dog or something.  Maybe a Doberman.

     He loves her.  But this problem is real.

                    RACHEL
          Look.  I know they hate me.

                    LUKE
          They don't hate you --

                    RACHEL
          And what you're telling them is keep
          hating her -- keep up the good work --

                    LUKE
          Nobody's telling them to hate you --

                    RACHEL
          Really?  Look in your ex-wife's eyes.

                    LUKE
          It's complicated for Jackie.  It's
          complicated for me...You don't have
          kids -- you don't understand --

                    RACHEL
               (angry now)
          Oh right...So it's just complicated for
          you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty
          simple cause I just don't understand...

                    LUKE
          No you don't.  And I'm not gonna
          screw with my kids heads right now --

                    RACHEL
          You know I don't need another person in
          this family making me feel like an
          idiot...your ex-wife's doing a bang up
          job and I have to face it every Tuesday
          and Thursday and every other goddamn
          weekend and I just don't know how the
          hell you were married to her for so
          goddamn long!  Jesus what did you see in
          her?  I don't get it -- I just don't get
          it.

     They've reached their building.  As they enter...

                    LUKE
          She's a great mother.

     INT. RACHEL'S AND LUKE'S LOFT - NIGHT

     The door of the freight elevator CLANGS open.  As Rachel and Luke
     step out into their loft, the phone is RINGING.

     She looks to Luke.  Then RUNS to SNATCH it up...

                    RACHEL
          Hello?

     INTERCUT:  INT. ANNABELLE'S CLOSET - JACKIE'S HOUSE

     Annabelle with a phone in her closet.  Hearing Rachel, she hangs
     up.  A pink POST IT creeps under the door.  CAN I JOIN YOU FOR
     DESSERT IN THE CLOSET?  VANILLA OR CHOCOLATE YOGURT.  PLEASE CHECK
     ONE.

     INT. RACHEL'S AND LUKE'S LOFT - FRIDAY NIGHT

     The most beautiful little puppy in the world -- sitting in a puddle
     of pee on a hardwood floor.

                    RACHEL
          Aw George...not again... who wants to
          help clean up this time?
               (overly zealous)
          Annabelle?

     She looks around -- completely exhausted.  It's late.  Annabelle is
     video taping the dog pee.  Ben's in the kitchen talking to himself.
     He pours and sprinkles, working intently on a MAGIC POTION.

                    ANNABELLE
          Why do you make that face when you talk
          to me?
               (she imitates Rachel)
          And that voice you use...you think I'm 
          deaf or something?

     Ben ZAPS the magic potion theatrically with his fingertips.

                    RACHEL
               (reaching for her)
          I'm sorry, okay?  Let's not fi...

                    ANNABELLE
          Don't touch me!  I'm allergic to you!

     She starts sneezing furiously and scratching.  Ben comes out of the
     kitchen carrying a steaming cup of potion.

                    BEN
          "Those who travel far and near this
          will make you DISAPPEAR!"

                    ANNABELLE
          I have to work on my video project!
          Don't follow me!  I can put myself to
          bed.

     She races upstairs.  Rachel follows.  So does Ben.  And George.

                    BEN (O.S.)
          Excuse me --

                    RACHEL
               (following into 
                Annabelle's room)
          Annabelle let's get something clear.

                    ANNABELLE
          I don't have to listen to you!  You're
          not my mother.

                    RACHEL
          Thank God for that!

     She leaves the room SLAMMING the door behind her.  Takes a breath,
     turns, and walks back in.

                    RACHEL
          What I meant and perhaps I didn't say
          it well was you have a great mom.  You
          don't need another one.  But when
          you're at this house --

                    ANNABELLE
          This is my daddy's house --

                    RACHEL
          This is my house too!

                    ANNABELLE
          And this is my room so get out!

                    BEN (O.S.)
          Excuse me.

     Rachel throws open the door.  Ben stands there innocently.

                    BEN
          I made you some cocoa.  See?

                    RACHEL
          Thank you Ben.  That was so sweet of
          you.
               (pointedly to Annabelle)
          Goodnight Annabelle.  Sweet dreams.

     Rachel leads Ben to his room.  With Rachel safe out of sight,
     Annabelle takes the puppy into her arms and cuddles it.

     INT. BEN'S ROOM - RACHEL'S AND LUKE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Rachel, dead on his feet, reads "Goodnight Moon" to Ben.

                    RACHEL
          "In the great green room there was a
          telephone and a red balloon..."

                    BEN
          Aren't you going to drink your cocoa?
          It's the good kind.

                    RACHEL
               (faking a big sip)
          Mmmm!  Tasty.  You're a master chef Ben.
          Just like your dad.

     Ben points to the book -- she 'reads' skipping pages, a hundred
     miles an hour desperate to get to the end of the book.

                    RACHEL
          "Goodnight moon, goodnight hush,
          goodnight mush, goodnight goodnight
          goodnight Gracie -- Goodnight Ben!

                    BEN
          No!  You're cheating -- you have to start
          from the beginning and you have to read
          the whole thing I can't sleep otherwise.

     Ben's eyes are glued to her.  She lays down next to him, yawns.

                    RACHEL
          "In the great green room there was a
          telephone and a red balloon..."

                    BEN
          "And a picture of the cow jumping over
          the moon..."

                    RACHEL
               (laying head down)
          That's nice Ben.

     Ben reads until Rachel's asleep.  He looks at her in AWE.

                    BEN
          Rachel!  Rachel!

     No response.  Rachel's really asleep.  He lifts her head.  It flops
     down!  In HORROR he jumps off the bed and with a quick look back,
     races from the room, and...

     ...DARTS down the hallway, BUMPING into walls -- He LEAPS inside
     Annabelle's room, SLAMMING the door behind him.

                    ANNABELLE
          Ben!  What's wrong?

                    BEN
               (triumphantly)
          I killed her!

     Ben and Annabelle gape at one another, stunned.

     EXT. JACKIE'S HOUSE - MORNING

     Rachel pulls up FAST in Luke's Grand Cherokee.  As she SCREECHES to
     a stop, the kids pile out with their gear.

     Rachel takes an anxious look toward Jackie's place.  Here we go.

     INT. JACKIE'S KITCHEN - MORNING

     The clock reads 8:10.  Rachel and the kids enter.  Annabelle's hair
     is brushed forward, hiding her face.  Ben is ebullient.  Jackie's
     edgy, ready to snap.

                    JACKIE
          How do you hold down a job?  It's 8:10.
          You were supposed to be here at 7:00.
          She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride.

                    RACHEL
          This is Friday, her riding lesson is
          on Tuesdays. 
               (pulls out post it)
          I got it right here...

                    JACKIE
          Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of
          the month when it's switched to Friday
          except in April when she rides on
          Thursday.  It's not that hard.  Didn't
          you have a mother?

                    RACHEL
               (flinching)
          Can I please have a cup of coffee?

                    JACKIE
          We don't have any coffee.

                    RACHEL
          What is this?  The Betty Ford Center?

                    JACKIE
          Annabelle, how's your video rep...

     Annabelle RUSHES past her.  Ben saunters off after his sister.
     Jackie turns to Rachel, accusingly.

                    JACKIE
          What happened with Annabelle?  Has
          nothing I said gotten through to you?

                    RACHEL
          Maybe you could back off just a little
          bit --

                    JACKIE
          What did you do?

                    RACHEL
          Nothing.  Look, I want to talk to you
          about...well...Luke said to ask you...

     Jackie's edge sharpened by Rachel's unease.

                    RACHEL
          See, the place where I can connect
          with Annabelle is my photography.
          Because she loves video and all...

     And...?

                    RACHEL
          She's been talking about this little
          editing machine, it's only...

                    JACKIE
          ...a ridiculously expensive and
          inappropriate item, which her father
          and I have already told her she is far
          too young to own.  But you apparently
          want to buy her forgiveness, with...

                    RACHEL
               (had enough)
          Forgiveness?  For what, exactly?

     Silence.

                    JACKIE
          How much time have you got?  Let's
          start with this morning.  Why did she
          run from this room?

     Long beat.  Then, Rachel looks dead on at Jackie.

                    RACHEL
          Luke was in the shower this morning and
          Annabelle sort of walked in without
          knocking.

                    JACKIE
          I'm sure that didn't upset her.
          Everyone in our family takes showers.

                    RACHEL
          I was in there in him.

     The air is thick with tension.

                    JACKIE
          Did you or Luke talk to her about it
          afterwards?

                    RACHEL
          No.  I thought it might be uncomfortable
          for her --

                    JACKIE
          You mean for you.  A 10-year-old girl is
          coping with the fact that her father is
          never coming back to live with his
          family.  She sees her father naked with
          another woman for the first time.
          And you think it's best for her if every-
          one pretends it didn't happen?
               (turning away)
          This isn't going to work out.

                    RACHEL
          You're damn right.  I'm gonna sick of
          your imperious bullshit.  I never said I
          was Betty Fucking Crocker.  If every time
          life hits her in the face you want to
          have a 12 hour talk every third Friday
          or the month -- go ahead!  I have a life!

                    JACKIE
          Oh and I don't because I have a children?!
          The problem is you're too self-involved
          to ever be a mother.

                    RACHEL
          Maybe the problem is your kids.  Maybe
          they're spoiled, coddled brats!

                    JACKIE
          Get out!

                    RACHEL
               (holding up Post Its)
          But it's not on the schedule!

                    JACKIE
          You got to hell!

     Jackie turns away, storming out of the room.

                    RACHEL
          Ah Ah Ah!  You owe me a quarter --

     INT. YMCA KITCHEN - DAY

     Luke stands in an apron before Annabelle's Girl Scout Troop,
     rolling out a large pie dough.  They imitate his every move.

                    LUKE
          Now Ladies, the secrets to a great pie
          is the crust.  And the secret to a
          great flaky pie crust comes from less
          flour and more...what?

                    ANNABELLE
          Ice cold water.

                    LUKE
               (adoringly)
          That's my girl...

     Rachel watches from a corner.

                    LUKE
          Blueberry pie must be topped with vanilla
          Haagan Daz and/or creme fraiche...now the
          secret to a great creme fraiche is...

                    ALL THE GIRLS
          Orange peel!

                    LUKE
          ...which also is the secret to...

                    ALL THE GIRLS
          French toast!

                    LUKE
          Now don't forget to teach your fathers
          that.  Next week...apple brown betty!

     He takes off his apron and walks toward Rachel as the girls file
     out...

                    RACHEL
          She said no.

     He doesn't even know what she's talking about.

                    RACHEL
          The editing machine.  I mean,
          Annabelle would have really loved it.

     She looks down.

                    RACHEL
          It would have been great for us,
          so obviously, Jackie just...

     Eyes down.  Choosing her words.

                    RACHEL
          She's really a difficult person...

     Looks up.

                    RACHEL
          Best thing ever happened to you was
          her throwing you out on your butt.

     An afterthought...

                    RACHEL
          Not that I have a personal stake
          in it.

     He comes and kisses her.

                    LUKE
          Get ready.  To get really mad.

                    RACHEL
          Uh.  Annabelle's video report has been
          switched again.

                    LUKE
          Not yet.

                    RACHEL
          Hey, I sold my body to Satan to clear
          Friday at two o'clo...

                    LUKE
          We have the kids.  Next weekend.

     WHAT???

                    LUKE
          And it's my call.  I promised them
          water-skiing, instead o...

                    RACHEL
               (quiet pain)
          Our weekend.  At that sweet little
          B & B.

     He puts his arms around her.

                    LUKE
          And the evil part is.  I am so stoked
          about the water-skiing.  I can't wait.

     He tastes her mouth.  And again.  A sweet, hot moment.  Her fingers
     trace up his neck.  To his hair.

                    RACHEL
          No, this is good.  Celibacy is
          healthy.  For a guy your age.  You'll
          get used to it.

     From the kiss that follows.  He won't have to.

     INT. JACKIE'S KITCHEN - DAY

     CLOSE ON an ANSWERING MACHINE.  IT CLICKS, WHIRLS, and...

                    RACHEL (O.S.)
          Hi, it's the trophy bimbo.  Annabelle's
          teacher called, and her video report
          is being moved up to 8:30 tomorrow.
          Sorry to deprive your step aerobics
          class of their role model.

     Pause.  PULL BACK to see...

                    RACHEL (O.S.)
          Anyway.  I'm sorry I lost my temper
          the other day.  And I'm sure you are,
          too, so...

     ...BEN, looming over the hardware.  Fingers poised above the
     buttons, and he...

                    RACHEL (O.S.)
          ...no, apology necessa...

     ...strikes!  Playing all the keys at once.  Like chords on a baby
     grand.

     INT. CLASSROOM - MORNING

     CLOSE on a small TV MONITOR, the angelic face of 10-year-old TAMARA,
     practicing for the Miss America Diplomatic Interview, circa 2009...

                    TAMARA
          Well, I I had a million dollars...
          I would use it to...feed all the
          precious hungry children of the world.
          And bring about total world peace.

     PULL BACK to see the class and teacher watching raptly.  Filmmaker
     Annabelle in the seat of honor next to her proud father.  Rachel in
     the back of the room, anxiously looking at the back door.  While on
     screen...

     ...another face.  JARED, bad as he wanna be...

                    JARED
          A million big ones.  Oh.  I'd buy
          about a thousand babes.  Not to do
          anything bad, I mean.  Just to hang
          with.

     Near the monitor, Annabelle's eyes are also furtively cutting to
     the classroom's back door.  On screen now...

     ...the handsomest 10-year-old since DiCaprio.  BRAD the Dreamboat.
     Stares soulfully at the camera.  Murmurs...

                    BRAD
          Well, first off, Annabelle.  I'd
          give half of it.  To you.

     The class OOOOOS, WHISTLES.  Annabelle flushes, but she clearly
     likes it.  Brad grins a Redford grin her way.  And through the back
     door BURSTS...

     ...a harried, disheveled JACKIE.  Still in workout clothes.  As on
     screen...

                    ANNABELLE
          There you have it.  Now ask yourself
          ...what would YOU do?

     The screen goes BLACK.  The class, teacher and especially Luke
     ERUPT with APPLAUSE.  So does Jackie, who has locked eyes across
     the room with her mortally-wounded abandoned daughter.  Then
     Jackie's eyes CUT TO...

     ...Rachel, a deer in headlights.  Death by Army ants would be too
     kind.

     INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY

     Annabelle, Luke and Jackie GLARING at Rachel, who looks awkwardly at
     her feet.  KIDS stream past, unaware of the gravity of the moment.

                    JACKIE
          Machines do not EAT message.

                    RACHEL
          Look, I...

                    JACKIE
          Of all the cheap excuses.  To break a
          child's heart.

     The jury is in.  There is no appeal.  Jackie takes her daughter's
     hand.

                    JACKIE
          Don't worry, sweetie, there's still
          the Harvest Pageant.  And you are
          the lead vegetable...

     Said with bottomless pride.

                    JACKIE
          And nothing.  And no one.  Can
          keep me away.

     One laser look at Luke. This bitch is your responsibility.  And
     she leads her baby off.

     EXT. JACKIE'S HOUSE - DAY

     A parked VAN, packed with SNOWBOARDS and ski gear.  No people.  PAN
     across the suburban lawn to...

     ...Luke, dejected, at Jackie's door.  Rachel nearby, still peers
     into the window of an unlit, empty house.  A cellular phone RINGS.
     Luke WHIPS it out, like the Governor's pardon hangs in the
     balance...

                    JACKIE (O.S., from carphone)
          You paged us?

                    LUKE
               (distraught)
          Where are you?

     INTERCUT throughout...Jackie on her cellular, herding the kids
     toward a CIRCUS TENT...

                    JACKIE
          Just outside the big top, we're
          almo...

                    LUKE
          You're WHERE?

                    JACKIE
          At the Big Apple Circus, it's the
          only big top I know.  I said I'd
          get 'em back tonight...

                    LUKE
          Jackie, we were taking them water-
          skiing for the whole weekend!

                    JACKIE
               (innocent)
          ...until the plan changed, when
          Jessie's mom gave us these tickets.
          What, Rachel. 'forgot' I told her?

     Luke's eyes DART to an uncomprehended Rachel.  She's never seen
     him this angry.

                    JACKIE
          Don't tell me.  Another machine ate
          another message?  Boy, there's a lot 
          of that going around!  Put her on, huh?

     A beat.  He hands the phone to Rachel. She brings it to her ear...

                    RACHEL
          Yeh?

                    JACKIE
          Think twice.  Before you ever pull
          that again.

     CLICK.  The line is dead.  And so is Rachel.

     EXT. CENTRAL PARK CASTLE - DAY

     A glum Annabelle and Ben sitting on a bench watching Rachel at her
     photo shoot, George between them.

     A beautiful WOMAN appears in the turret -- she lets down her hair --
     a modern day RAPUNZEL -- her golden locks fall 17 feet -- now a BURST
     of yellow -- as a hundred YELLOW CANARIES fly out from her mane!  A
     beautiful MAN begins to CLIMB the hair.  FLASH!  The man DANGLING
     in mid air surrounded by canaries.

     Rachel works with intense concentration.  It's been hours.
     Annabelle and Ben are completely bored.

                    RACHEL
               (to Cooper)
          The timing was off -- I need this light.

                    ANNABELLE
               (to herself)
          Just where I wanna be all Saturd...

                    RACHEL
               (to everyone)
          Hold lunch!

                    ANNABELLE
          But we're hungry -- and I have to pick
          up my costume for the pageant!  It
          starts at seven!

                    RACHEL
          It's only one o'clock...Why don't you
          get another Fudgesicle -- I'll be done
          soon -- really soon.

     Annabelle and Ben.  Rolling their eyes.

     LATER...Annabelle asleep on the bench.  Rachel stands over her, a
     canary on her finger.

                    RACHEL
          Lunch time Sleeping Beauty.  Where's
          Ben?  Is he in the bathroom?

                    ANNABELLE
          I don't know...I feel like I'm gonna
          throw up.

     EXT. PARK MEN'S ROOM

     Annabelle stands with Rachel by a line of empty urinals.

                    ANNABELLE
          What if he's kidnapped?

                    RACHEL
          He's not kidnapped he's -- he's just
          hiding -- he's just -- BENNNN?  GODDAMMIT!

     Panicked, she grabs Annabelle's hand.

                    ANNABELLE
          Don't touch me!  You bring bad luck!

     Rachel.  Starting to believe it.

     INT. CASTLE TOWER - MOMENTS LATER

     Breathless, Annabelle and Rachel CLIMB the castle stairs when they
     hear WHIMPERING -- Rachel follows the whimpering -- RUNNING --

                    RACHEL
          Ben!  Ben we're here!  BEN!

     In the corner of the tower we see GEORGE staring up at her.  But
     Ben is NOWHERE to be found.

                    ANNABELLE
          He's gone forever and I'm gonna miss
          the pageant.

     Rachel once more.  Her life flashing before her eyes.

     EXT. POLICE STATION, CENTRAL PARK - LATER

     Jackie BLASTS up in the Volvo, SLAMS to a stop in a non-spot, RACES
     into...

     INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

     Jackie RUNS through the police station moving down corridors past
     desks until she sees BEN sitting with TWO POLICEMEN on a bench.
     She holds him to her chest, shaking.

                    JACKIE
          Ben!  Oh my Ben!  Are you alright?

                    BEN
          I knew where I was all the time.

     INT. AUDITORIUM - THAT EVENING

     Ben sits between Jackie and Luke holding each of their hands.
     Rachel sits on the other side of Luke; all waiting for the Harvest
     Pageant to begin.  It's horribly tense.

                    RACHEL
               (sincerely)
          Jackie?  I am so sorry about today I
          really fucked up royalty.  When you
          called Luke I was so goddamn relieved --

     Luke elbows her with an "We're in an Elementary School" elbow.

                    RACHEL
          No I did -- I know I did -- I screwed 
          up.  I feel like such an asshole...

     Jackie lifts Ben onto her lap, holding him tightly.  She turns and
     faces Rachel, claws bared.

                    JACKIE
          Shhhhhh!

     The lights go down.  They sit pretending the other is not there.

     On stage -- The class is dressed as the harvest PRODUCE.  Annabelle
     is the CORN.  Each FOOD DISH steps forward and introduces itself.
     Annabelle rehearing her line over and over.

                    ANNABELLE
          "Hello!  I am Maze.  But you can call
          me Corn.  Hello!  I am..."

     Inside her costume, her breathing is sharp.  She stands very
     straight, very bold.  A brazen ear of corn.  She steps forward.

                    ANNABELLE
          "Hello!  I am...

     Rachel POPS UP next to the stage with her huge PROFESSIONAL CAMERA
     and giant flash.  Her camera FLASHES three times, quickly.  After
     each flash, we see the picture for a split second, Annabelle.  A
     TERRIFIED ear of corn.  A LOST ear of corn.

                    ANNABELLE
               (blinks, disoriented)
          Um...I'm...I'm...Oh...

     In the audience, Jackie is willing her daughter a recovery.  Sees
     instead, a completely DEVASTATED ear of corn.

                    ANNABELLE
               (exploding in tears)
          Oh forget it!

     She runs offstage amidst laughter and applause.  Luke looks over at
     Jackie but she and Ben have already left their seats.

     EXT. AUDITORIUM FOYER - NIGHT

     Jackie comforts Annabelle.  Ben watches closely, getting caught up
     in his sister's sadness.  Luke and Rachel approach.

                    ANNABELLE
          I hate her.  I really hate her.

                    LUKE
          There you are!

                    ANNABELLE
               (covering her face)
          Don't take my picture!

     She starts to cry.  Ben's lip quivers, his eyes well up.

                    JACKIE
          Annabelle doesn't really want to talk
          to you right now.

                    RACHEL
          I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your
          concentration.  I thought it would be
          a nice moment to rememb...

                    ANNABELLE
          I don't ever want to remember this!

     A TURKEY approaches.

                    TURKEY
          They're taking a picture of the
          Produce, we need the Corn.  C'mon
          Annabelle.

                    JACKIE
          See?  No one's laughing at you.  Your
          friends want you to join them, Anna-
          belle.  Corn is a very important part
          of the Harvest Produce.  Now Ben, walk
          your sister over to the Yams.

     Ben takes Annabelle's hand.  When they are gone...

                    RACHEL
          Jackie, if I thought for one moment...

                    JACKIE
               (lighting into Luke)
          You listen carefully because I am only
          going to say this once.  That woman has
          nothing more to do with my children.

                    LUKE
          Our children.

                    JACKIE
          Do you realize what could have hap-
          pened to your son today?  How lucky we
          are the police found him before some
          lunatic did?  He could have been...

                    LUKE
          But he hasn't.  He wandered off.  I
          know it's terrifying.  I can imagine
          how you felt when that call came -- But 
          it happens.
          
                    JACKIE
          Not to me.

                    LUKE
               (soft, reasonable)
          Jackie, you've made mistakes -- We all
          make mistakes --

                    JACKIE
          I'm not gonna wait around to see the
          next one.  I'm not gonna watch my kids
          fall through the cracks of this
          arrangement.  I'm seeing a lawyer.

                    LUKE
          Jackie stop.  We promised we never go
          there.

                    JACKIE
          We've broken a lot of promises,
          haven't we Luke?

                    RACHEL
          Why are you taking this out on him?

                    LUKE
          Rache, get out of th...

                    RACHEL
               (still to Jackie)
          You haven't done one goddam thing to
          make any of this easier...

                    JACKIE
          I am not here to make it easier for
          you.  These are my children.  They
          don't want to be with you.

                    RACHEL
          Well, maybe they would if they thought
          it was okay, with y...

                    JACKIE
               (poking Luke's chest)
          A court order is gonna say that woman
          is never alone with my children!  Ever 
          again!  Do you HEAR that?

     All of New Jersey heard that.  On the silence that follows, she
     stalks off.  The mother lion.  Doing what she has to do.

     EXT. NORTH VALE STABLES - DAY

     Jackie and her children ride HORSES side by side through a perfect
     Fall afternoon.  Our riders look about alertly, as if patrolling
     enemy territory.

                    ANNABELLE
          Guinevere, Godiva, I sense enemy
          sol...

                    BEN
          I don't want to be Lady Godiva 
          anymore, no matter how much I like
          chocolate.  I want to be a stud.

     In distance, a gaggle of GROUNDSKEEPERS.  Jackie points these out
     to Ben, without missing a beat...

                    JACKIE
          Lord Nelson, Napoleon's troops.  I
          fear for the women and the property
          values.

                    ANNABELLE
          I'll ride ahead.  Nelson, protect the
          Queen...

     And she canters off, blood in her eye.  Alone now with his mom, Ben
     has something serious on his mind.

                    BEN
          Mommy?  It's not Rachel's fault I ran
          away.

                    JACKIE
               (doesn't turn)
          No, that's your fault.  It's her fault
          for not watching over my precious son,
          as if it were her priority.  Which
          means, the most important job.

                    BEN
               (thinks about this)
          Rachel's job is she works.

                    JACKIE
          Ben, mommies work too.  They work very
          hard.  Mommy works harder as a mom
          than she did when she was working.  I
          just don't get paid.

                    BEN
          Does Rachel make a lot of money?

                    JACKIE
          People like Rachel who only think about
          themselves often do make a lot of money.

                    BEN
          I think she's pretty, Mommy.

                    JACKIE
          Yes...if you like big hair...

                    BEN
          Mommy?

                    JACKIE
          What honey?

                    BEN
          If you want me to hate her I will.

     On Jackie.  Stunned.  Her lips part for an answer.  But she hasn't
     got one.

     EXT. JACKIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Luke pacing around on the path through Jackie's front lawn.  Jackie
     exits the house, alone.  Stands on the porch.  And they stare at
     each other.

                    JACKIE
          You know, you can come inside the
          house.

     He looks at the end of his rope.  She walks down to him.

                    LUKE
               (quietly)
          Did you see the lawyer?

     Oh.  Well...

                    JACKIE
          Called him.  We set an ap...

                    LUKE
               (almost a whisper)
          Don't do this.

     So vulnerable.  The air comes out of her.  We see how much she
     still cares for this man.

                    JACKIE
          You're saying, don't make the kids
          a football, don't put them through a
          war.  But I'm doing this for their
          well-being.

                    LUKE
          Partly.  But partly, you're mad.

     Staring.  At each other.

                    LUKE
          You know the kids aren't really in
          danger.  This is about Rachel, and
          you're right, I'm disappointed in her
          learning curve, and...

                    JACKIE
          Slugs.  Have faster learning curves.
          Trees, even.

     He takes a breath.

                    LUKE
               (here it is)
          I'm afraid she's going to walk.

                    JACKIE
          And I'm supposed to care.

     He reaches out.  Takes her hands.

                    LUKE
               (softly)
          About me, yeh.  Like I care about you.

     She looks in his eyes.

                    JACKIE
          Like you cared about me three
          years ago?

     He shrugs.  Looks saddened by that.

                    LUKE
               (softly)
          Hey.  You kicked me out.

     And just this once.  With all that's happened.  Jackie needs to
     say...

                    JACKIE
          Maybe you should talk to your
          daughter, about why.  She seems to
          have missed that part.

     Now he looks ashamed.  And sorry from his heart.

                    JACKIE
               (softly)
          Forget I said that.

     He has to tell her...

                    LUKE
          This thing with Rache.  I need this.
          I don't want to lose her.  And I will
          see to it that the kids don't suffer.
          Help me, huh?

     Help me.

                    LUKE
          I'd do it for you.

     Yes, he would.  Despite everything, she knows that.

                    JACKIE
          One last chance, don't make me
          regret it...

     Her voice tried to be tough.  But the tension showed through.

                    JACKIE
          ...or you will, too.

     A last look.  She walks slowly.  Back toward the house.

     EXT. CAR POOL LINE, ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - AFTERNOON

     The last cars are pulling away.  No kids left, except the ones
     shooting hoops.  Except.  On the low brick ledge by the flag
     pole...

     ...Annabelle sits.  Alone.  Quietly freaking.

     INT. RACHEL'S STUDIO - AFTERNOON

     Rachel and Cooper sit on a bare floor SURROUNDED by countless
     PROOFS of FLYING CANARIES.  An assistant brings a cell phone to
     Rachel, who holds it in place with her shoulder, as she frantically
     sorts through the prints...

                    RACHEL
               (into phone)
          ...no, no, that is not possible.  You
          must have the wrong little gir...

     Stops.

                    RACHEL
               (into phone)
          ...because Annabelle's mother never
          forgets, is never late, is never
          imperfect.  So that's some other kid
          sitting on the curb by the car pool li...

     Listen.  All the air comes out.  She looks around, sadly, at all
     the work surrounding her.

                    COOPER
          May I remind you that Duncan has the
          client arriving at exac...

                    RACHEL
               (into phone)
          Sure.  I was just doin' my nails.

     INT. RADIOLOGY LAB - AFTERNOON

     A cavernous sterile room.  A horrible METALLIC HAMMERING sound.
     PAN to see that it comes from...

     ...a white cylindrical TUBE.  Bare feet protrude.  An MRI is in
     progress.  The sound stops.  The body SLIDES from the tube, a woman
     in a hospital gown.  She is Jackie.

     She blinks at the light.  Her eyes are drawn, a million miles away.
     A lot on her mind.  A TECHNICIAN enters the room...

                    TECHNICIAN
          Your paper went off during the
          procedure.  Do you want the number?

     Jackie turns, suddenly focusing...

                    JACKIE
          Wait...what time is it?

     INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

     Annabelle sits glumly, refusing to eat some chips from the bag in
     Rachel's hand.  Rachel's voice is low, soothing.  Dare we say,
     maternal...

                    RACHEL
          Hey, sea salt and vinegar, I know
          this is your fave.

     Annabelle keeps her eyes down.  This is more than a sulk.  She
     seems fairly unglued.

                    RACHEL
          C'mon, these are the Bomb, I prom...

                    ANNABELLE
          Now could she just...forget me!

     Looks up.  Eyes desperate.

                    ANNABELLE
          I mean, that's something you would do!

     Rachel stares back.  Eats a chip.  Decides...

                    RACHEL
               (softly)
          Tell ya the truth?  I did.

     The kid blinks.  A non-compute.

                    RACHEL
          Your mom had to...help a friend with
          this...emergency?  And she called me.
          And we switched days.  Then, I got
          stuck on my shoot, and...

                    ANNABELLE
          MOMMY!

     Rachel WHIRLS to see JACKIE filling the doorway, Annabelle flying
     to her mother's arms.  The women's eyes meet.  How much did she
     hear?

     INT. JACKIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Jackie brushing out Annabelle's hair.  Jackie's eyes are distant.
     Annabelle watching in the mirror.

                    ANNABELLE
          Are you worried about your friend?
          With the emergency?

     Jackie's eyes come back to focus.  Hmmn?

                    JACKIE
          Oh, I'm waiting on some news, that's
          all.  Say.  Can I ask you why you
          never asked me something you probably
          asked Daddy anyway?

     And she smiles.  Real carefree.  So Annabelle smiles back.

                    ANNABELLE
          You can try.

     More brushing.  Gentler, slower strokes.

                    JACKIE
          Daddy was washing Rachel.  In the
          shower.  What did you think that was
          about?

                    ANNABELLE
          Sex.  Of course.

     Oh.

                    JACKIE
          Well, not exactly s...

                    ANNABELLE
          Why does Rachel scream?

     Does she mean what Jackie thinks she means?

                    JACKIE
          Scream.

                    ANNABELLE
          During sex.

     Oh.  Again.

                    JACKIE
          How would you know sh...

                    ANNABELLE
          I live.  In the same country.

     Her mother laughs.  Encouraged...

                    ANNABELLE
               (imitating)
          Oh God oh God Oh God oh God oh God
          Oh...

                    JACKIE
          ...why do you think?

                    ANNABELLE
          Because it feels really incredibly
          good.

     Jackie moves around.  Leans to stare in her eyes.

                    JACKIE
          So why are you asking me?

                    ANNABELLE
          I like talking about it.  At least,
          to you.

     The look holds.  Almost a bittersweet smile plays on Jackie's lips.
     She leans to kiss her daughter's head.

                    JACKIE
               (a murmur)
          Same here, huh?

     INT. RACHEL'S DARKROOM - MORNING

     TOTAL DARKNESS -- Slowly an IMAGE APPEARS -- Floating in a pool of
     water.  It's a photo of a child's FEET.  Only the wrong shoe is on
     the wrong foot.  Suddenly, KNOCKING...

                    RACHEL
          Hold on!  Don't let the light...

     Jackie enters, leaving the door wide OPEN.

                    RACHEL
          ...in.

                    JACKIE
          I'm sorry.  Look, I'm not real
          comfortable being here, but...

                    RACHEL
          I don't recall inviting you.

     Silence.

                    JACKIE
          I overhead what you told Annabelle.
          The lie.

     Unreadable faces.  What are they feeling?

                    RACHEL
          I have a snoop.

                    JACKIE
          I didn't need you to take the blame
          for me, I'm quite...

                    RACHEL
               (simply)
          I didn't do it for you.  Believe me.

     And Jackie.  Finds that interesting.

                    RACHEL
               (shrugs)
          She already hates me.  You've seen to
          that.

                    JACKIE
          You're not terribly good at taking
          care of h...

                    RACHEL
          I need practice.

                    JACKIE
          Those are my children you're
          practicing on.  They deserve first-
          rate care.  Every minute.  Of every
          night.  And every day.

     More silence.

                    JACKIE
          So why did y...

                    RACHEL
          I did it for her.

     Straight to her eyes.

                    RACHEL
          Poor kid has to believe in someone.
          Even if it's you.

     Nothing friendly about it.  But Jackie hasn't come seeking
     friendship.

                    JACKIE
          I have an appointment this after-
          noon.  I need someone to take them
          to the park.

                    RACHEL
          What?  And have Federal agents jump
          out of the bushes with court orders?
          How many years do you get in this
          state for giving second-rate care to
          minors?

     Hard looks.  All around.

                    JACKIE
          However many.  It's not enough.

                    RACHEL
          I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday,
          I actually thought my boss was going
          to fire me.

                    JACKIE
          Fine, forget it.

     But neither of them wants her to.  A Mexican Standoff.  Until
     Jackie empties her huge purse on the counter.

                    JACKIE
          Bandaids for cuts.  Bandaids for new
          shoe blisters.  Packet of Wash n Dri's.
          Kleenex.  Sugar free lollipops, potty
          seat covers for public restrooms...

                    RACHEL
          Why not just bring the whole toilet?

                    JACKIE
          Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know
          Dr. Seuss...?

                    RACHEL
          Not personally.

                    JACKIE
          Do you have a word limit you need to
          hit every day or can I finish?

     This silences Rachel.  Jackie hands her a Post It.

                    JACKIE
          Here's their schedule for this after-
          noon.  I'll meet you at the park at
          five.  All I ask is that they're alive
          when I get there.

     A beat.

                    RACHEL
               (dry)
          Thank you.

     And scoops up the parenting paraphernalia.

                    JACKIE
               (drier)
          Thank you.

     And walks out the door.

     INT. STUDIO CORRIDOR - MORNING

     Jackie stands outside a door.  Deciding.  She knocks and enters...

     ...Duncan's office.  He sits behind his desk, across from a client.
     Both men looking up at this stranger.

                    JACKIE
          Mr. Samuels?  Forgive the intrusion,
          I'm Jacqueline Harrison, and...

     The sweetest smile she's got.  Which is pretty good.

                    JACKIE
          ...well, I just wanted to thank you.
          For your generosity.

                    DUNCAN
               (a beat)
          Gener...

                    JACKIE
          ...my daughter had a terrible
          emergency yesterday.  My husband and I
          couldn't be reached, and...your Ms.
          Kelly came to Annabelle's rescue.

     Confides...

                    JACKIE
          I'd hate to think what might have
          happened.

     Shakes her hand.

                    JACKIE
          She told me that you were so suppor-
          tive, even at great inconvenience to
          your business, and...

     An amazing smile.

                    JACKIE
          It's wonderful to see a successful
          man.  With that sense of priorities.

                    DUNCAN
               (longer beat)
          Well...under the circumstances...

                    JACKIE
          If I can ever repay your kindness.  It
          would be my great pleasure.

     Backing out the door...

                    JACKIE
          ...and your Ms. Kelly?  A remarkable
          young woman.

     The client is beaming.

                    DUNCAN
               (clearing his throat)
          We think so.

     INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

     CLOSE on Jackie, looking down.  She seems to be staring at
     something in her lap...

                    JACKIE
               (quiet anger)
          I don't even know what that means.
          Spread.  That is very unclear.

     ...but there is nothing there.  Her lap is empty.  Except for her
     unnaturally still hands.

                    FEMALE VOICE (O.S., gently)
          I means we found some cells.  In your
          lymph nodes.  In three of them.

     The hands come together.  Slowly, deliberately.  Stating to anyone
     who would watch that there is no panic here.

                    JACKIE
          But the other time.  You said you got
          it all.  So you could be wrong again.
          One time, you say one thing, then...

                    FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
          The other time.  Was a year ago.

     The air comes out of Jackie.  In a thin, slow, precise stream.
     Everything, her very breath.  Under complete control.

                    FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
          That was a tiny lump in the breast.
          We radiated, we thought we had it
          all. We were hopeful.  But there
          were no guarantees.

     Silence.  Jackie's eyes stay on her folded, still, hands.

                    JACKIE
          But we can beat it.

     PULL BACK to see the small, neatly kept office.  DR. SWEIKERT is
     50, slender, elegant, kind.  The doctor you want when you're dying.
     Jackie looks up to her.

                    JACKIE
          People beat it, don't they?  All
          the time.

                    DR. SWEIKERT
               (straight)
          Every day.  More and more.

     Jackie swallows.  The confirmation of hope has allowed some of the
     fear to show.

                    JACKIE
          So we'll...radiate some more?

                    DR. SWEIKERT
          At first.  Then, after awhile, some
          chemo.

     A blow.  Jackie absorbs this.

                    JACKIE
          That's necessary, huh?

                    DR. SWEIKERT
          Let's take our best shot.

     Jackie nods.  Staring at the woman.  Then, to break the spell...

                    JACKIE
          I guess a no-hair day beats a
          bad-hair day.

     The doctor smiles.  Jackie looks at her watch...

                    JACKIE
          I have to get dressed.  My ex-husband
          has asked me to dinner.  God knows
          why, he was very mysteri...

                    DR. SWEIKERT
          Have you still never told him?

     A flash of the anger flickers.

                    JACKIE
          Why would his worry?  Or my children's
          worry.  Or anyone's worry.  Help the
          sit...

                    DR. SWEIKERT
               (very soft)
          Sooner than later.  You really need
          to.

     That brings a silence.  A shading of defiance to Jackie's features.

                    JACKIE
          You don't burden others needlessly.
          That's how I was raised, Doctor.

     Hold the look.

                    MR. SWEIKERT
          Maybe at dinner tonight.  Think
          about it.

     INT. JACKIE'S BATHROOM - DUSK

     Jackie is getting dressed in front of the mirror, her eyes distant,
     in spite of her attempts at control.  Annabelle is watching her
     like a hawk.  We see Ben in the BACKGROUND -- sawing the BABYSITTER
     ALISE in half.

                    ANNABELLE
          Why are you going to a French
          restaurant?

     Throughout, Annabelle is trying on Jackie's jewelry, making a pest
     of herself.  Jackie fights against rising irritation.

                    JACKIE
          Because it's quiet.  And he wants to
          talk.  Alise -- Once he saws you in
          half, it's bedtime...

                    ANNABELLE
          What are you gonna talk about?

                    JACKIE
               (applying mascara)
          Probably you -- your brother -- school --
          The solar system...The usual...

                    ANNABELLE
          Then why are you putting on mascara?

                    JACKIE
               (a beat)
          I'm a little tired and it's just a
          pick-me-up.

                    ANNABELLE
          But you only wore mascara when you and
          Daddy went on romantic dates...

                    JACKIE
          Well Daddy and I are just friends
          now, and that's no reason not to
          wear mascara...

                    ANNABELLE
          Or blush.  You look pale.

     EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

     A Country French place on the West Side.  Classy, but inviting.

     INT. FRENCH RESTAURANT - NIGHT

     Jackie and Luke sit across from each other in the lovely
     restaurant.  Jackie looks beautiful in the warm candlelight.

                    LUKE
          ...Maybe you don't think three years
          is enough for a person to change
          but...things are different now Jackie.
          I'm different.

     Jackie feels her heart beginning to race.  They lock eyes for a
     moment.  He unconsciously begins to eat off her plate.  He eats
     her chicken, and in the dance they've done a thousand times -- she
     reaches for his uneaten vegetables.  The WAITER approaches.

                    WAITER
          Would you and your wife prefer
          still or sparkling water?

     He doesn't correct the waiter.

                    LUKE
          Still, please.

                    JACKIE
               (when the waiter leaves)
          Annabelle showed me the new dress.
          She's amazing in it.

                    LUKE
          Getting so beautiful...she looks more
          like you every day.
               (Luke downs Jackie's wine)
          Jackie...I've really given this a lot
          of thought.  A great deal of thought...

     Their eyes lock for a moment.  Here it comes...

                    LUKE
          I'm gonna marry Rachel.  I know you don't
          think much of her but she's a special
          person -- she really is.  And I love her.
          This is a bridge we never wanted to cross
          but it's not helping her or the kids if I
          don't really commit to that.

     Jackie stares at him stonefaced.

                    LUKE
          I didn't think a phone call was
          appropriate...

                    JACKIE
          Tell me exactly how you're different
          from three years ago?  The music
          sounds kind of the same from where
          I'm sitting.

     He shifts in his chair.  Wants this to sound as authentic as he
     feels it...

                    LUKE
          I grew up, a little.  I'm ready for a
          life that's built around commitm...

                    JACKIE
          Just not to me.

     The waiter returns with a bottle of red wine.  It's horribly quiet
     as he pours.  Waits, obtrusively.

                    LUKE
          Thank you, it's fine...

                    WAITER
          Would you like to taste it?

                    LUKE
          Can we please have less service, here?

     The waiter leaves, taking his attitude with him.  Luke sighs...

                    LUKE
          It's going to be hard for the kids
          when I tell them...I'd like you to
          be there.

                    JACKIE
          To make it easier for them or you?

                    LUKE
          It's a huge moment in their life --

                    JACKIE
          You can't be an 'us' just when you
          want to.  You can't play that card
          when it's convenient.

                    LUKE
          We...

                    JACKIE
          WE are over.

                    LUKE
          WE'RE still their parents for the next
          hundred years.

     On this, Jackie looks down at her hands.

                    LUKE
          You're still going to have to be
          dealing with me -- with us.  We should
          tell them together.

                    JACKIE
          No.  You think this is going to help
          the kids then you do it.  You're on
          your own.

     INT. RACHEL'S AND LUKE'S LIVING ROOM - THAT NIGHT

     Jackie sits next to Luke on the couch -- looking lovingly towards the
     children, who sit across from them.  Annabelle is taping this...

                    JACKIE
          The great thing about life is that
          things keep changing.

                    LUKE
          Remember when Mommy and Daddy got
          divorced?

                    JACKIE
          And we all went through that together?

     ON Ben.  OH MY GOD.  He knew it!

     ON ANNABELLE -- Behind the video camera -- Where's this headed?

                    LUKE
          Well things are going to change
          again...

     Ben LEAPS up from the couch and FLIES into Jackie's arms.

                    BEN
          I knew it!  I knew it!  I knew you
          guys were getting back together!

     Jackie looks at Luke.  Annabelle ZOOMS IN on their faces.

                    ANNABELLE
          No they're not.

                    LUKE
          Annabelle put down that camera.

     She ZOOMS in on his face.

                    LUKE
          Put down that goddamn camera!

                    ANNABELLE
          You owe me a quarter.

                    JACKIE
          Look she's upset --

                    ANNABELLE
          No I'm not.  I don't care.  Why should
          I care?  I mean nobody asked me when
          you got divorced.  Nobody asked me if
          I wanted a new mother.  Nobody even
          asked me if I like her.  If you guys
          don't care about our family staying
          together, why sh...

                    JACKIE
          Daddy and I tried hard.  We really did.

                    BEN
          No you didn't!  All you guys did was
          name call!  I heard you!  You didn't
          even try and use your words!

     Ben runs out of the room.  Luke follows him.

     INT. BEN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Ben pulls his cape over his head and hides in a bundle in the
     corner.

                    BEN
          I'm disappearing.  I'm almost
          invisible...

                    LUKE
               (holding him)
          I'll find you wherever you go...my
          magic boy...I'm still your daddy...
          nothing will ever change that.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Jackie moves to Annabelle who won't put down the camera.

                    JACKIE
          Annabelle...Rachel's not taking my place
          as your mother -- it's just Daddy's chance
          to be happy again.  Isn't that what we
          all want for each other?

     No answers.  Jackie looks at this daughter she loves so much.  Pats
     the seat beside her...

                    JACKIE
          Come.  Sit.

     Something in the softening of the tone changes the atmosphere in
     the room.  More real.  More like equals.

                    JACKIE
          Life is full of hard things.  And we
          can't always have what we want, you
          know that.

     Don't you?  Annabelle nods, cautiously.

                    JACKIE
          But we do have a choice.  To make it
          better.  Instead of worse.

                    ANNABELLE
          Like how?

                    JACKIE
          Like seeing the good side of Rachel.
          So she'll see the good side of us.

     Annabelle's stare is hard and questioning.  She didn't expect this.

                    JACKIE
          Because I'm looking ahead.  And you
          know what I see...?

     Annabelle doesn't.  But she sure is listening.

                    JACKIE
          Time will come.  When we all need to
          be there.  For each other.

     Strokes her baby's hair.

                    JACKIE
          That happens.  To families.

                    ANNABELLE
               (straight back)
          I'll be there for you.

     Her mother's eyes cloud with feeling.  A murmured...

                    JACKIE
          I'm counting on it.

     INT. RACHEL'S AND LUKE'S KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON

     Barely any light in the empty kitchen.  PAN to see Ben, alone, in
     his cape.  Carefully, he sets a cup of saucer atop a cloth napkin
     that lies across the butcher block table.

     He GRASPS the corners of the napkin.  He looks scared.  We get
     what's about to happen.  As he...

     ...YANKS the napkin, as FAST as he can, the cup and saucer, RATTLE
     and...

     ...stay put.

     Ben.  Is astounded.

     And then he looks up.  To a cabinet filled.  With glassware and
     china.

     INT. RACHEL'S AND LUKE'S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

     ...Rachel's HAND as a beautiful ANTIQUE RING is slipped on her
     finger.  She is asleep.  Then, she...

     ...stirs, wakes.  Stares at her hand in shock and delight.

                    RACHEL
          Oh my God.  Are you serious?

                    LUKE
               (tenderly)
          I think so...What do you think?

                    RACHEL
          I think so too...

     They hold each other for a long time.

                    LUKE
          It's forever you know.

                    RACHEL
               (trying to read him)
          Okay...Is that the good thing or the
          bad thing?

                    LUKE
          Because I can't hurt anyone like 
          this ever again.

     She grins.

                    RACHEL
          How did you hurt someone?  She threw
          you out, remember?

     He does.  She hugs him tight.

                    RACHEL
          Everything's gonna work out.  The
          kids and I...we're going to love
          each other.

                    LUKE
          Rache, it may take time.

                    RACHEL
          What's eight, ten years?  Hell, you'll
          still be ambulatory.  I think.

     She's counting on her fingers.  He kisses her.

                    RACHEL
          It's inevitable.  Look, I was
          defensive, I was insecure.  I was
          afraid to love first.

     Her incredible smile.  Filling even Luke with confidence.

                    RACHEL
          But I'm not anymore.

     A sudden horrific CRASHING sound.  The breakage of the breakable.
     Their look holds.

                    RACHEL
          I'll get this.

     A quick kiss.  And she's gone.

     HOLD on Luke's light smile.  Maybe this will all work out.

     INT. BEN'S ROOM - LATE NIGHT

     Ben is cuddled up in his coverlet.  Almost as if he's hiding.  She
     picks up some stray underpants.  Actually, three of them.

                    BEN
          Are you real mad?

                    RACHEL
          How could I be?  We learned some
          magic...

     She goes to his bed.  Sits down.

                    RACHEL
          I made all the pieces disappear.

     Oh.  She leans toward him...

                    RACHEL
          And you learned...

     She kisses his forehead.  Very sweetly.

                    RACHEL
          ...to make that trick disappear,
          huh?

     He nods.  Big time.  She stands, smiles...

                    RACHEL
               (softly)
          A night.  Of learning.

     They share the smile.  And Rachel leaves, into the darkened hall.
     Down it now, only to...

     ...stop.  Open a door, so quietly.  Silently enter...

     INT. ANNABELLE'S ROOM - LATE NIGHT

     ...the room of a sleeping child.  Rachel moves soundlessly to
     Annabelle's side.  Stares down.  Listens to the soft breathing.
     She straightens the covers slightly, in a maternal way.  Then, on
     impulse, reaches down...

     ...tenderly smooths back a strand of hair.  One last look.  And
     she...

     ...leaves frame.  HOLD on Annabelle, as we hear the knob turn.  The
     door close.  Alone, now...

     Annabelle opens her eyes.  She is thinking.

     EXT. JACKIE'S HOUSE - DAY

     Rachel dropping off Annabelle at Jackie's door.  They must be late,
     because Rachel is looking anxiously at her watch.  Not even
     noticing that Annabelle has pulled out a tube of LIP GLOSS, turning
     the shaft to reveal a glittering golden-colored gloss.  Then...

                    RACHEL
          Uh.  Put that away, hon, your mom w...

     The door OPENS.  Jackie is dressed for riding.

                    RACHEL
               (sincere)
          Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping
          Ben off at Kevin's.

                    JACKIE
          It's okay, it's twenty minutes.  The
          horse'll be there.

     Rachel blinks.  Is she on the right planet?

                    ANNABELLE
          Mom, look what Rache got me!

     Uh-oh.  The kid holds it up.

                    ANNABELLE
          It's not to wear around, or any-
          thing, I'm way too young.  It's
          just for play.

                    RACHEL
          See, I...

                    JACKIE
               (taking it)
          That is so pretty.  You usually only
          see that color in people's teeth.

     Annabelle has entered the house, to see on a table by the door a
     huge, brightly-wrapped PACKAGE.

                    ANNABELLE
          Wow.  Who's that for?

                    JACKIE
               (quietly)
          Well.  It's for you.

     The kid WHIRLS around.  Really?

                    JACKIE
          Just because.  Just because I love
          you.  Go ahead...

     Annabelle starts to unwrap the present with Christmas-morning-care.
     Jackie looks at the glitter gloss...

                    RACHEL
          I'm sorry, I just...

                    JACKIE
          Hey.  At least it's not an editing
          machine.

                    RACHEL
          No way.  I told her two, three years,
          maybe, for such an expens...

     And stops.  Because the paper has come off.  A giant deluxe model
     beginner's VIDEO EDITOR.  Annabelle is STUNNED silent.  So's Rachel.

                    ANNABELLE
               (tears in her eyes)
          Oh, Mommy...

     And JUMPS into Jackie's arms, CRUSHING her with the hug mothers
     live for.

                    JACKIE
          I hope it's the right kind.

                    ANNABELLE
          Are you kidding?  It is so much better
          than the one Rachel showed me!

     Jackie strokes her baby's head.

                    JACKIE
          Well, I thought.  You know, why wait?

     The child turns to Rachel, frozen in the doorwary.

                    ANNABELLE
          I told you I was big enough!  Is my
          mom the greatest, or what?

     Rachel swallows.

                    RACHEL
          The greatest.

     HOLD on the look.  The women share.

     EXT. NORTH VALE STABLES - DAY

     Jackie and Annabelle riding.  The kid is still on Cloud Nine.
     Jackie's eyes are on her.

                    ANNABELLE
          ...I mean, she knows all the music,
          and pop stars, and clothes and stuff.
          She's like still a kid, herself.

                    JACKIE
          Like a big sister.

                    ANNABELLE
          She knows every neat junk food place.

     Looks to see if her mom is okay hearing...

                    ANNABELLE
          Actually.  She's kind of cool,
          when you get to know her.

                    JACKIE
          I bet.

     Annabelle studies her mom's profile.

                    ANNABELLE
          And don't tell her I told you.

                    JACKIE
          Secret's safe with me.

     INT. LUKE AND RACHEL'S BEDROOM CLOSET - NIGHT

     Rachel sits cross-legged on the floor of the walk-in closet.  Next
     to her, a glass and a botle of Stolie, getting toward the bottom.

     An ashtray filled with butts, and...

     ...a card board box.  Dragged out of somewhere.  Photo albums, loose
     snapshots.  Vintage stuff.  From her face, this is not a carefree
     romp down Memory Lane.  She takes another hit on the Stolie.  More
     than slightly intoxicated, weaving, squinting at...

     ...the next photo.  Luke, young, straddling a Kawasaki.  Jackie,
     just as young, holding him from behind.  She wears a halter and
     shorts, and looks simply terrific.

     Rachel looks drunk and jealous.  With an overlay of self-pity.
     Brings the photo closer.  Squints harder.

                    RACHEL
          What the fuck is that?

     Her worst fears confirmed...

                    RACHEL
          ...a tattoo?

     INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NEW YORK - DUSK

     The lights are coming on in The City.  Jackie sits staring out the
     window, as an IV drips into her arm.  She is alone, and down.  And
     fighting the fear of what may come to pass.  Her pager goes OFF.

     Jesus.  She pulls a cell phone from her purse.  Works it with one
     hand.  Brings up...the smile.  Showtime.

                    JACKIE
               (softly)
          Hey, good-lookin', I was just
          thinking about calling y...

     INTERCUT throughout:  Ben on the phone in Rachel's and Luke's
     kitchen.  He is alone.  Staring through the glass window of the
     oven...

                    BEN
          Rache says I have to eat lamb.  I
          told her you're making me spaghetti!

                    JACKIE
          Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you
          up tomorrow, and we do big spaghetti.

                    BEN
          And many meatballs.

     A nurse enters, and Jackie shoots her with a wave of her fingers.

                    JACKIE
          You'll be up to your armpits in
          meatballs, I'm flying them in
          from Sweden.

                    BEN
          Is that like Luigi's?

     She loves this kid so much.

                    JACKIE
          Not a lot, sweetie.  It's a country.
          Like Canada.  Only smaller.

                    BEN
          Where are you, anyway?

     And the feeling comes straight to her eyes.  She can't fight it.

                    JACKIE
          I'm somewhere, thinking of you.  And
          meatballs.  And you know what?

                    BEN
          Yes.

                    JACKIE
          Of course, you do.  Being magic.
          Then you know I've got a flu bug,
          and I turn green and barf profusely
          when I even think about food.  So,
          all the more meatballs for you.  But
          you know what.

                    BEN
          I did.  Do I have to eat lamb?
          Daddy didn't cook it, she did.

                    JACKIE
          Do me a favor?  Eat it, and then
          give me a secret report, okay?  Pay
          particular attention to whether it's
          chewy and if it tastes more like
          chocolate or soup.

     He laughs.  And she can hear that.  And her eyes fill.  And she
     murmurs...

                    JACKIE
          Hey, that's a world-class laugh
          you got there.  Can I all you
          sometime?  If I fell blue.

     A silence.  And for a heartbeat, the fear.  Did he hear it in my
     voice?  But no...

                    BEN
          Sure.  You got my number.

     And now she's crying.  But she can't.  She can't.  Gains control
     for a whispered...

                    JACKIE
          That I do.  Always will.

                    BEN
          Mom...?

     She sniffles...

                    JACKIE
          I'm fine, ba...

                    BEN
          Tomorrow?  Can I have one
          butterscotch pudding for dessert?

     See her relief.  Secret still safe.

                    JACKIE
          Nope.

     He's crestfallen.

                    JACKIE
          We can only have two.

     INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

     Jackie is pushing her cart.  Ben sits in it, pulling things off the
     shelves.  On automatic she's putting them back.

                    BEN
          Mommy, if your real name's Jackie and
          I call you mommy; and Rachel's real
          name's Rachel...Then when I see her do
          I say hi Stepmommy?  And if my name's
          Ben, how come you don't call me son?

                    JACKIE
               (lost in thought)
          Thursday's fine...

     Frustrated, Ben CLIMBS OUT of the cart and trails behind Jackie.
     He reaches for an apple off the BOTTOM of a huge display of Red
     Delicious, and the whole thing comes TUMBLING DOWN.  Shaken, she
     looks around for Ben.  He's gone.

     INT. SUPERMARKET MANAGER'S STATION - DAY

     Jackie with a Store Manager and a Policeman stand at the front of
     the store near the Bakery.  Jackie is totally distraught.

                    JACKIE
          I looked away for one second...
          Just one second...he's...he's...

                    POLICEMAN
          How would you describe him?

                    JACKIE
          He's my son!  He looks like his
          father!  His name is Ben -- he
          answers to Harry --

                    MANAGER
          Is he wearing a red shirt?

     The manager POINTS to the frozen food bin.  There, lying on his
     back atop dwindling stores of Breyer's ice cream...is Ben.  Hands
     and beaming face PRESSED to the underside of the glass.  Jackie
     does the only reasonable thing...

                    JACKIE
          YYYAAAAAAAHHH!

     ...and FLINGS OPEN Snow White's glass coffin.

                    JACKIE
          ARE YOU CRAZY, YOU COULD SUFFOCATE
          IN THERE!!!

                    BEN
          Nope.  I got my warm t-shirt.

     Enough of a non-sequitur to make everybody blink, before Jackie
     YANKS him, roughly and tenderly, from the bin.  She CRUSHES him in
     a violent, desperate hug...

                    BEN
          You found me cause I'm your
          priority, huh?

     She kisses him fiercely.  At the edge of tears.  Whispers...

                    JACKIE
          You got that right.

     EXT. SOCCER FIELD - 3 O'CLOCK PRACTICE

     Luke coaching the girls team.  Annabelle one of many who surround
     him for that final word of wisdom...

                    LUKE
          Alright my Little Warriors, remain
          calm; trust that the ball will find
          you; remember they're your opponent
          not your enemies -- Not kick MAJOR
          butt!

     In the bleachers, Jackie sits alone with Rachel.  They are having a
     coaching session of their own.  Rachel points down to the field,
     where...

     ...Annabelle pushes her hair over her eyes.

                    RACHEL
          She's gonna trip over her own feet,
          if she doesn't get her hair out of
          her eyes.

     Jackie casts a sidelong glance at Rachel.  Decides to tell her...

                    JACKIE
          Pushing her hair over her eyes.
          Means she's avoiding a confrontation.

     Rachel looks over.  Really?  Jackie decides to share more.  Reading
     Rachel's reaction to...

                    JACKIE
          If she's twirling it, she's playing
          something out in her mind.  If she's
          stopped combing it, she might be
          depressed...

     As Rachel listens she's unconsciously twisting her hair.

                    RACHEL
          What about obsessively picking her
          split ends?

                    JACKIE
          Anxiety.

                    RACHEL
          Last week when she chopped her
          Barbie's bangs all to hell --

                    JACKIE
          She was angry at herself.

                    RACHEL
          Jackie?

                    JACKIE
          Yes?

                    RACHEL
          When I twisted hair like this it
          means I'm intimidated by you...

     Jackie gives her the trace of a smile.

                    JACKIE
          I'll keep it in mind, and use it
          against you.

     She looks back down at the game.  Rachel watching her profile.
     Finally...

                    RACHEL
          You feeling all right?

                    JACKIE
               (doesn't turn)
          Not great.  Plus, I've got things on
          my mind.  You know.

     Things.  Rachel doesn't know.  Blurts...

                    RACHEL
          Are you...seeing someone?

     Jackie snorts a laugh.  In spite of herself.

                    JACKIE
          Yeh, that does tend to make me sick
          to my stomach.  Actually, I'm, uh...

     Thinking.  Deciding if this is the time to say...

                    JACKIE
          ...thinking of going back to Random
          House.  On a part-time basis.

                    RACHEL
          Wowie.  How wonderful!

     But Jackie still hasn't turned.  Eyes glued to Annabelle, racing
     around with determination.

                    JACKIE
          Well, I could do most of it from
          home.  But, while I'm working it out
          with the head editor, I'd need to...

     Sighs.  Boy, this is tough.  Tries for matter-of-fact...

                    JACKIE
          ...make some trips into the city.
          Sometimes, overnight.

                    RACHEL
          Hey, any help you need, we'll cover.

     Jackie nods.  Appreciates that.  But she still hasn't turned to
     look Rachel in the eye.

                    RACHEL
          Uh.  Have you told Luke and the ki...

                    JACKIE
          Let's...hold up for a bit.  It may
          not happen.  Our secret, okay?

     A little strange.  Particularly the hardness of Jackie's eyes.
     Rachel watching her.  Something's up.

                    RACHEL
               (softly)
          Sure, if you like.

     Jackie looks away now.  To the playground just beyond the
     bleachers.  Kids rise swings, clamber over a jungle gym.  But her
     eyes are routinely, automatically, zeroing in on one single kid...

     ...who is climbing his way UP a tall SLIDE.  Crouched over as he
     inches up the shiny metal surface, using the side rails.  Rachel
     follows Jackie's eyes, just as...

     ...Ben reaches the top and STANDS UP, hands OVER his head, Jackie's
     breath catching, Ben totters once and...

     ...FALLS fast, hitting the grass with a thump we can hear, lying
     crumpled, motionless, as our two women...

     ...SPRING up as one, SCRAMBLING down the bleachers, RUNNING toward
     the playground, Jackie initially in the lead, but Rachel out-
     sprints her, CLOSING  on the child, as he rolls over grasping his
     leg, and reaching him first...

     ...some instinct makes her hold back, let Jackie RUSH past her, to
     kneel at Ben's side.  She lifts her baby in her arms.  His pants
     are torn, his leg is bleeding.  His own concern...

                    BEN
          I can still go to Tucker's party,
          right?

     INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY

     A full house of walk-ins with assorted needs, none of which appear
     to require George Clooney on an urgent basis.  Across the room, an
     irritated Jackie finishes the last of the paperwork at the nurses
     station.  Exchanges a less-than-pleasantry with the less-than-
     helpful duty nurse, and...

     ...heads off through the crowd, DOWN a hallway, TURNS a corner, to
     see...

     LUKE stands by a doorway.  Smiling, as he gazes into a hospital
     room.  Jackie comes to his side, looks in...

     Ben doesn't see them.  His back is turned, as he talks to Rachel,
     who sits on the side of his bed, feeding him the pudding she got
     from a vending machine.

                    BEN
          ...for Christmas, okay?  Every
          magician needs a white dove, a
          real one, they do!

                    RACHEL
          Well, that's a long way off, sweetie.
          We'll talk to Mom and Dad...

                    BEN
          Dad!  You can talk him into anything!

     Unseen by the two, Luke grins.  Then, Ben snuggles into Rachel's
     arms and kisses her.  Jackie stares.

                    RACHEL
               (singing softly)
          'In the still...still of the
          ni-ight...I held you... held you
          so ti-ight'...take it, man...

                    BEN
               (singing softly)
          Doo-wop-doo-doo, doo-wop-doo-doo...

     Jackie stands there.  Her eyes are difficult to read.  But she sure
     is watching.

                    LUKE
               (softly)
          Nice, huh?

     She steps back.  Looks him in the eye.

                    JACKIE
          It is.  It's about time.

     He give her a goofy give-me-a-break FACE.  She twists the corner
     of a smile.

                    LUKE
          She's a charmer, you'll see.  In
          fifty years, the kids'll love her
          ten percent as much as they love you.

                    JACKIE
          Stop.  You're making me insecure.

     Now they're smiling at each other.  In the old way.  A nice moment
     for them.

                    LUKE
          You changed your hair.

     And we notice.  It does look different.

                    JACKIE
          It's temporary.

                    LUKE
               (grins)
          It's good.  You're not pulling a
          mid-life crisis on us, are you?

     Her look holds.  An odd extra beat.

                    JACKIE
          Not the term I'd use.

     He glances back through the doorway...

                    LUKE
          You want us to take him tonight?
          Give you some private time with
          Annab....

                    JACKIE
          Never stand between that kid and
          a meatball.

                    LUKE
          Yet another spaghetti night.

                    JACKIE
          Yeh, better I should forcefeed
          him burnt lamb and...couscous,
          was it she made him?  Boy, kids
          go wild for that.

     She pats him on the shoulder...

                    JACKIE
          I'll drop him at Tucker's party
          Saturday, if one of you guys can
          pick him up.  I have to go into
          the City.

     And breezes by him into the room.  Ben wheels to see her...

                    JACKIE
          You know what happens to spaghetti
          when it waits around for you too
          long?

     He really thinks.  Actually...

                    BEN
          No.

                    JACKIE
          Pray.  We never find out.

     EXT. A PERFECTLY MANICURED TWO STORY HOME - DAY

     A door with balloons OPENS -- STACY, the birthday boy's mom, stands
     there -- children running behind her in party hats, all with their
     conservatively dressed SUBURBAN MOMS.  Rachel's attire a sharp
     contrast.

                    RACHEL
          Hi, I'm here to pick up Ben.

                    STACY
          Does Jackie know this?

                    RACHEL
          No.  I'm doing it behind her back.

                    STACY
          In seven years Jackie's never
          missed one of Tucker's parties.
          Where is she?

                    RACHEL
          Something came up.  C'mon Ben!
          I've got a shoot at three...

                    STACY
          Tucker hasn't penned Ben's present
          yet -- it won't be too much longer.

     Rachel eyes the MOUND OF PRESENTS yet to be opened.  DISSOLVE TO...

     FORTY-FIVE MINUTES LATER...Rachel, in a pointed party hat, sits
     schmushed on the couch in between all the other MOTHERS.  A black
     jeans stranger in a strange peach land.  She eyes that mound of
     presents.  Not even a dent.  She pulls out her cell phone, moves
     towards the hallway.

                    RACHEL
          Hey Cooper...pull a number 64 steel
          blue gel on the back light...yeah
          I'm on my way but...

     A piece of CAKE FLIES through the air and LANDS on Rachel.

                    STACY
          Now Ben, let Tucker play with his
          Batcave...

     Ben won't let go of Tucker's presents.  Tucker tries to take it.
     Ben is adamant.  Rachel reaches for him, tousling his hair.

                    RACHEL
          Hey Benjy boy -- chill.
               (he shimmies away from her)
          He's there already?  No I don't want to
          talk to him -- Duncan?  How are you...

     The mothers are all too aware of Rachel on the phone.  Two kids
     shoot water guns -- Rachel gets drenched.  Ben pulls at the toys...

                    BEN
          I want it!

                    STACY
          Ben I know you're angry and confused
          but it's Tucker's birthday party.

     Ben and Tucker fight for it -- the mothers all LOOK TO RACHEL.

                    RACHEL
          Ben --
               (into phone)
          Duncan I'm aware of that - Goddamn it
          Ben!  Let go of it.  NOW!

     He stares at her.  It looks like he's gonna let go --

     On the mothers -- impressed, not to mention surprised.  When Ben
     suddenly HURLS the toy onto the floor SHATTERING IT!  A horrible
     SILENCE falls over the room.  Broken only by the sound of Duncan
     SCREAMING from inside the phone.

                    DUNCAN IN PHONE
          Rachel...This is a big bloody account --
          If you don't show up in five minutes...

     Rachel takes Ben and leads him into another room.

                    RACHEL
          Ben I'm sorry.  It's been a hard day.
          Now would you do us both a favor and
          take this phone and...

     She SLAMS the phone SHUT.  Hands it to Ben.

                    RACHEL
          ...make it disappear.

     Okay.  He SHOVES it down the front of his pants.  The peach moms
     are taken aback.  Rachel nods, you got it.  Delighted, Ben turns,
     scampers off, as...

     ...his pants start RINGING.  He stops dead.  Looks down at them.

     Still RINGING.  He turns around and waddles delicately back to
     Rachel, as if he's carrying nitro in his shorts.  She holds out her
     hand...

                    RACHEL
          Breaks out the geiger counter, the
          man is radio-active!

     He pulls the ringing phone from his pants.  She grasps it without
     hesitation, while peach moms wince in disgust.  SNAPS it open...

                    RACHEL
          Get over it, Dunc...
               (stops)
          ...whoa, whoa, Annab...

     Listens.  While everybody watches.

                    RACHEL
          Could it be, maybe...anywhere else?
          Like...another galaxy would be more
          convenient.

     Listening, listening.  Everybody really watching.  Even Ben.
     Rachel oblivious...

                    RACHEL
               (gently)
          Okay, don't cry.  Flunking science
          is not happening.  On my watch.

     EXT. STACY'S YARD - LATER

     All the kids are running around crazily in a hypersugared frenzy.
     Peach moms drink diet sodas and chat.  Rachel making a call by the
     phony little carp pond...

                    RACHEL
          ...just that her daughter left a
          science book somewhere at her house,
          and I need t...

     INTERCUT throughout:  a starchy, powerful, crisply intellectual
     SENIOR EDITOR, in her early fifties and her Jil Sander outfit.  The
     East Side below her window.

                    SENIOR EDITOR
          I'm sorry, Ms. Harrison is not here.
          I think I mentioned that.  Twice.

     Rachel nodding.

                    RACHEL
          Well, she's been meeting with the
          head editor for the last few w...

                    SENIOR EDITOR
          Miss, I am Senior Editor.  Ms.
          Harrison left Random House eleven
          years ago.  We have not had the pleas-
          ure of a visit from her in that time.

     Rachel blinks.

                    RACHEL
          Actually, she's going back to
          work with your company on a part-
          time basis.

                    SENIOR EDITOR
          Excuse me.  If Jackie Harrison were
          coming back to the editorial staff,
          I would be frankly delighted.  And I.
          Would be the first.  To know.

     Silence.  In the midst of hysterical children.

                    RACHEL
          Thank you for your time.

                    SENIOR EDITOR
          Don't mention it.

     And Rachel's line.  Is dead.

     EXT. JACKIE'S HOUSE - DAY

     Rachel alone at Jackie's front door.  Staring at the key in her
     hand.  One last chance to back out.

                    RACHEL
               (mutters)
          What the hell.

     OPENS the door.  Enters the empty home.  Walks slowly, self-
     consciously, down the hallway.  Kitchen, kids' rooms...

                    RACHEL
          Now, if I were a science book,
          where would I...

     And stops.  At the doorway of the master bedroom.

                    RACHEL
          Who am I kidding.

     And goes straight to Jackie's desk.  Starts rummaging through the
     incredibly neat stack of papers...

                    RACHEL
          Great, I'm leaving prints.

     The open appointment book.  Today's date.  Just says, NEW YORK.
     Nothing more.  Opens a drawer.  Stapler, clips, neatly-stacked
     stationery.  Opens the bottom drawer, and...

     ...stops.  She pulls out...AIRLINE TICKETS.  Opens the folder.
     Continental Airlines.  Newark to San Francisco.  And tucked
     inside...

     ...a fax, neatly folded.  Rachel opens it.  The letterhead says,
     NORTH POINT PRESS, 134 Sutter Street, San Francisco, California.
     CHARLENE DRUMMOND, Editor.

                    RACHEL
               (reads)
          Jackie.  Can't wait to see you here.
          I know you're anxious.  But it's going
          to work out wonderfully, I promise.
          Til then.  Charlie.

     HOLD on Rachel.  Trying to put this together.

     INT. JACKIE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

     Jackie takes a kettle from the stove.  Pours the water into a tea
     cup.  Then, fills a second cup.  Drops a tea bag into each.
     Carries both cups to...

     ...the kitchen table.  Where Rachel is waiting.  She looks more
     than tense.  Actually, scared.  Jackie taking this in, as she sets
     down the tea.

                    JACKIE
          Okay, what is this?  If you want to
          dump Luke on me, no sale.  You're
          stuck with him.

     And before she can sit...

                    RACHEL
          I know your secret.

     Jackie FREEZES.  To stone.  No one says anything.  Two hearts
     beating at red-line.

                    JACKIE
          I don't know wh...

                    RACHEL
          I was looking for Annabelle's book,
          and I found your tickets.  And the
          note.  From your new boss.

     My what?  Jackie leans forward.  Her hands resting on the back of
     the chair she never sat in.

                    JACKIE
          My boss.

                    RACHEL
          You're not working at Random House,
          I talked to them.

                    JACKIE
          You WHAT?

                    RACHEL
          You're taking the kids.  And moving
          to San Francisco.

     And Jackie has to laugh.  Cold.  Bitter.

                    RACHEL
          Look, you've never liked me...

                    JACKIE
          Don't flatter yourself.

                    RACHEL
          And I know checking into your life
          was inexcusable...

                    JACKIE
          Nobody likes a snoop.

                    RACHEL
          But I came here to...

     All the air comes out of this young woman.  so vulnerable, so real.

                    RACHEL
          ...to beg you.  Not to do it.

     And at this.  A look of intense interest crosses Jackie's face.
     Really?

                    JACKIE
          I'd have thought this was the
          answer to your prayers.  Lose the
          witch, and her two brats, in one
          swoop.  Problems solved.

     Rachel is clearly distraught. This is no act.

                    RACHEL
          You can't take Luke's children
          away from him.

     Jackie thinking.  Reading this girl's face.

                    JACKIE
          Bi-coastal parenting.  Happens every
          day.  Luke gets the kids every other
          summer, every other holiday, it's not
          ideal, but people make it work, and...

                    RACHEL
               (blurts)
          We can't live like that.

     And Jackie straightens.  Cocks her head.

                    JACKIE
          Did I hear the word...

                    RACHEL
          Luke.  Can't live like that.

     Ah.

                    JACKIE
          Then let him talks to me.  We don't
          need you to solve our prob...

                    RACHEL
               (quietly)
          ...it's my problem, too.

     And Rachel's eyes.  Fill with tears.  She hates that.  Jackie won't
     take her off the hook.  Stands waiting, until...

                    RACHEL
          I got used to...thinking of them.
          As...my kids too.

                    JACKIE
          Really.  By what right?  Six months
          of part-time screw-ups?

     Rachel lifts her chin.  Defiant and tender at once.

                    RACHEL
          No right at all.  I just love them.

     Now it's Jackie's eyes.  That begin to fill.  And she hates that
     even more.

                    RACHEL
               (pleading)
          There's so many publishing houses
          in New York.  Surely, you could find
          a good one?

     Jackie takes a step back.  Shakes her head.  Goddammit, life is
     full of surprises.  She walks around in a little circle.  Turns
     back...

                    JACKIE
          Sure, I could.  If I was looking
          for one.

     Rachel's turn to be surprised.  Confused.

                    JACKIE
          You're a moron, kid.  You guessed
          the wrong secret.

     An odd, almost defiant look.  Jackie reaches up to her own head,
     and...

     ...slowly, holding eye contact all the way, she slips the wig from
     her head.  Her scalp covered by the partial regrowth that chemo-
     therapy has left her.  You can hear Rachel's GASP clear to Kansas.

                    JACKIE
               (calmly)
          Charlie Drummond used to be a
          colleague at Random House.  I'm
          crashing at her place, while I take
          some new protein injections my
          oncologist recommended.  I can only
          get them in San Francisco.

     Rachel's lips part.  But no sound comes.

                    JACKIE
          Life's a trade-off.  You get cancer,
          your hair falls out, but you do get
          to smoke dope.

                    RACHEL
               (please)
          You're not dying.

     The kid so painfully sincere.

                    JACKIE
          No such luck.  I'm beating the shit
          out of this.  Pardon my French.

     Rachel can't find her breath.  She is clearly the worse off of the
     two, in this moment.  Then she starts to nod...

                    RACHEL
          You bet you are.

                    JACKIE
          How the hell would you know?

                    RACHEL
          I don't, but...

                    JACKIE
          How would you know anything?

     That was sharp.  Rachel startles slightly.

                    JACKIE
          I exercise, I eat the healthiest
          foods, you live on pork rinds and
          Ho-Ho's, and I've got cancer!

     That leaves a silence.

                    RACHEL
          And cigarettes.  I smoke, too.

                    JACKIE
          You are marrying the greatest guy
          who walks this earth.  Who I have
          loved from my heart for twelveyears!

     Listening?

                    JACKIE
          And you walk in.  You smile that
          smile.  You move that boy.  And
          he's yours for free.

     She sags back against the counter.

                    JACKIE
          And you.  Love my kids.  How fucking
          touching.

     Comes forward.  Stalks her.

                    JACKIE
          They came out of my body!

                    RACHEL
          See, I know that.

                    JACKIE
          I have given them morelove and
          more care every fifteen minutes of
          their lives, than you could manage
          in the next fifty years!

     Leans over the table.  Rachel looks scared to death.

                    RACHEL
          Okay, I'm undeserving.

                    JACKIE
          Ironic, huh?

     And staring in Rachel's eyes, Jackie's fierceness fades.

                    JACKIE
          Ironic, that I'm gonna need you.

     All the air comes out.  Her heart as naked as her skull.

                    JACKIE
          To be a little less.  Undeserving.

     The look holds.  And holds.

                    JACKIE
               (quietly)
          Drink your tea while I go vomit.

     And turns, goes to the door.  Turns back.

                    JACKIE
          You love my kids, that's a start.
               (nods)
          We'll work on it.

     And gone.  Hear her footsteps.  Climbing stairs.  Rachel lifts her
     cup.  Looks at it.

                    RACHEL
               (calling out)
          This is very good tea!

     Then tastes it.  Makes a face.

     EXT. BAR - EVENING

     A graceful stone building with arched windows.  Gas lanterns on the
     exterior wall and burning dimly inside.  Stone gargoyles smile down
     on those who enter the heavy, bright red wooden door.

     INT. BAR - EVENING

     Drinks hour.  Upscale crowd.  Dim lights, clink of glasses, the hum
     of private conversations side-by-side.  Civilized as hell.  And at
     the deuce by the window...

     ...the man's head is down.  We can't see Luke's expression, as he
     stares at his clenched hands.  We don't need to.

                    JACKIE
          I thought a phone call was
          inappropriate.

     No one smiles at the irony.  Not much to smile about.

                    JACKIE
          I could have taken you to that
          restaurant, but it would have
          been a waste of money.

     He loos up.  She studies the pain.

                    JACKIE
               (softly)
          I know.  I wouldn't know what to
          say.  If it were you.

                    LUKE
          We're going to win this.

                    JACKIE
               (straight back)
          Walk in the park.  And thanks for
          the 'we'.

     Tears fill his eyes.  None in hers.

                    LUKE
          You're not alone in this.  You're
          not alone.  Jesus, you're not alone,
          okay?

     Jackie swallows.  Tries a smile that doesn't get halfway there.
     Looks down.

                    LUKE
          What happens next?

                    JACKIE
          I live or I die.

     Looks straight in his eyes.  We don't need the bullshit.  Not us.

                    LUKE
          Tell the kids together?

     She thinks.  A barely perceptible nod.

                    LUKE
          Want Rache someplace else?

     On that one.  She has to smile.

                    JACKIE
          My compliments.  On your learning
          curve.

     INT. JACKIE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

     Jackie carrying two steaming MUGS from her stove.  These have
     marshmallows floating in them.  She sets them down in front of her
     children.  Ben starts plucking the marshmallows out of Annabelle's
     mug.  Annabelle doesn't care, too busy video taping...

     ...her father.  Who sits with this tender, compassionate, and
     therefore rather ominous smile.  Doesn't take a smart kid like his
     daughter to guess...

                    ANNABELLE
          So what's up?  Who's marrying who
          this time?

                    BEN
          Mommy's marrying Rache!

     He's happy.  Jackie reaches and shuts OFF Annabelle's camera.  And
     the directness in her gaze keeps the child from complaining.

                    JACKIE
               (simply)
          Mommy's sick, guys.

                    BEN
          You have the WORST flu since...

                    JACKIE
          I have cancer.  Do you know what
          that is?

     He doesn't.  Someone else does.

                    ANNABELLE
               (real quiet)
          It's what Grammy Lil died from.

     Ben's eyes WHIP OVER to his sister.  He sees the cold fear in her
     face.  BACK to Mom.  She seems fine, calm, smiling even.

                    JACKIE
          Grammy had a different kind.
          There are lots of kinds.  Hers
          was very bad.

                    BEN
          Is your bad?

                    ANNABELLE
          Shut up.  She's going to die.

     But the anger in her eyes isn't for Ben.  She is glaring.  At her
     mom.

                    JACKIE
          Actually, I'm getting better already.

     Straight.  As if to an equal, an adult.

                    JACKIE
          I had a lot of treatments, and
          they weren't any fun, but the
          tests show the cancer got smaller.

                    LUKE
          A lot smaller.

     Annabelle cuts him an angry look.  He's on her shit list, too.

                    BEN
          So you're okay.

                    JACKIE
          I'm still sick, but I'm better.

                    ANNABELLE
          You lied to us when you nevertold us!

     Ben hadn't thought of that.  Nods now, yeh.

                    JACKIE
          That's right.  And you're mad.

     Annabelle just glares with all the hatred she can turn her fear
     into.

                    JACKIE
          I know how scared I get when
          you're sick.  So I waited to tell
          you.  Until it was getting smaller.
          I thought that was best, maybe I
          was wr...

                    ANNABELLE
          You lied.  If you lied then,
          maybe you're lying now.  I can
          never belive you again!

                    LUKE
          Annabelle, never say 'nev...'

     But Jackie's raised her hand.  Jump back, Jack.  The eye contact
     with her daughter never breaks.

                    JACKIE
          We make mistakes.  And we forgive
          each other.  Because we love each
          other, very m...

                    ANNABELLE
          Where's Rache?  It's Thursday,
          we get to be with Rache!

                    BEN
               (the diplomat)
          I'd rather be with Mommy.

                    ANNABELLE
          She's dying and Rache is your
          mother now!

     She jumps up from the table.  HISSES at her brother...

                    ANNABELLE
          You are so STUPID!

     And she RUNS, halfway to the door...

                    LUKE
          ANNABELLE!

     She turns, STARTLED at the anger in that.

                    LUKE
          You do NOT run out on your moth...

                    ANNABELLE
          YOU'RE WORSE THAN SHE IS!  WHY
          DON'T YOU JUST DIE, TOO?

     And BOLTS from the room.  In the silence she's left behind.

                    BEN
          Annabelle's worse than everybody.

     INT. LUKE AND RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Rachel and Luke cuddled in bed, watching a video in the darkness.
     At least, she is.  Just now, he's watching her.

                    LUKE
          Well, I think you should tell him
          you changed your mi...

                    RACHEL
               (softly)
          It's no biggie.

     She's still watching.  It's a French-language comedy.  She can feel
     his eyes on her.  Never turns...

                    RACHEL
          It's just an assignment.

                    LUKE
          It's Anna Sui, you should be
          doing it.

                    RACHEL
          Are you hungry?  You could make
          us something?

     She's still never looked at him.  He can see she's getting irritat-
     ed.  He says nothing.

                    RACHEL
          It's two solid months, around the
          clock, Jackie needs some cover-
          age, you're in a trial, what are
          we talking about?  There'll be
          other assignments.

     He kisses her hair and flinches slightly.  Tries to pretend it's
     because she's concentrating on the movie.

                    LUKE
          They're my kids.

                    RACHEL
          Great, wallow in guilt, you sure
          you're not Jewish?

     A long beat.  He snuggles closer.  They watch together.

                    LUKE
          She's not gonna die.

                    RACHEL
          I know that.

     INT. JACKIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Jackie and Ben cuddled in bed, watching a video in the darkened
     room.  It is not a French Comedy.  They are, however, eating
     popcorn.

     The door opens.  Annabelle stands motionless, composed.  Her face
     looks like she's been crying.  She clears her throat...

                    ANNABELLE
          I'm sorry you're sick.

     From across the room.  Jackie stares at her.

                    JACKIE
          I can't hear you.

                    ANNABELLE
          THEN TURN OFF THE CARTOON!

     Jackie cups her hand to her ear.  Shakes her head, can't hear a
     thing.  Waves, come on over.  And slowly...

     ...Annabelle does.  Crawls up into the bed, on the opposite side
     from Ben.  Into her mother's arms.  Jackie kisses her head, strong.
     Big smile.

                    ANNABELLE
          I said...

                    JACKIE
          ...I'm not deaf, y'know.

     They grin at each other.  Like equals.  Jackie picks up the remote,
     cuts OFF the sound.  And when Ben turns to her...

                    JACKIE
               (singing)
          In the still...still of the
          ni-ight...I held you...held
          you so ti-ight...

                    BEN
          That's Rache's song!

                    JACKIE
          Sugar.  I was slow dancing to that
          song before Rachel was even born.

     Wow?  Really?  You bet.  Annabelle chuckles.

                    JACKIE
          You think she's the Queen of Cool?

     Jackie shakes her head.  Pulls down the covers, pulls up her
     t-shirt...

                    JACKIE
          Does she have a tattoo?

     The butterfly.  Just below her navel.  Ben has seen this before, of
     course.  Touches it, with his small hand.

                    ANNABELLE
          He wouldn't know.  I saw her
          in the shower!

                    JACKIE
          And...?

     Ben looks to his sister.  For the verdict.  Annabelle shakes her
     head.  Nope.

                    ANNABELLE
          She is only the Princess of Cool.
          Mommy is the Queen!

                    JACKIE
          She is but an arriviste.

     A new word, apparently.

                    JACKIE
          A newcomer.  She's still got a
          thing or two to learn.

     Annabelle nods.  You betcha.

                    JACKIE
               (resumes singing)
          I held you...held you so ti-ight...
               (to Annabelle)
          You sing lead, you've got the voice...

     She bumps head gently with Ben.

                    JACKIE
          The stud and I will doo-wop.

     And as they doo-wop the back-up...

                    ANNABELLE
               (sings)
          For I love...lo-ove you soooo...
          promise I'll never...Let you go...

                    ANNABELLE/JACKIE
               (sing)
          In the still of the ni-ight.

     EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - NIGHT

     Parents streaming slowly in for a PTA night.  They are chatty,
     tired, preoccupied.  And 95% female.

     INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL COMMON ROOM - NIGHT

     Folding chairs set in rows.  Parents taking their seats with coffee
     and cookies.  Up front, a table where a panel of speakers are
     beginning to gather.  A faded banner says PTA -- TENAFLY DAY SCHOOL.
     Jackie is nibbling at a single cookie, when...

     ...a figure slips into the seat beside her.  Rachel is juggling a
     coffee and maybe nine cookies.  Drops one.  Picks it up.  Dusts it
     off.  Jackie is repelled, but has to smile.

                    JACKIE
          Small world.

                    RACHEL
          Luke's depo ran late.  I promised
          I'd take notes.

     To prove it, she balances the cookies on her thighs, and produces a
     notebook.  Looks around, and in a conspiratorial near-whisper...

                    RACHEL
          So I have to tell you something
          in confidence...

                    JACKIE
          You're a cross-dresser.

                    RACHEL
          That.  And.  Annabelle is over
          her head.  With Brad 'The Dreamboat'
          Kovitsky.

     Does a Groucho eyebrow move.

                    JACKIE
          She hasn't mentioned this.

                    RACHEL
          She was afraid you'd make a big
          deal out of it.

     Jackie is hurt.  Covers...

                    JACKIE
          Moi?

                    RACHEL
          Toi.  They've been 'going out'
          for two weeks.

     Rachel breathless and happy.  Jackie attentive.

                    RACHEL
          As you may know, 'going out' in the
          six grade doesn't mean shit.  They
          don't actually go to a movie or
          anywhere, they don't even eat lunch
          together, it's just a declaration to
          the world that they're...

                    JACKIE
          ...going out, yeh.  I had kids of
          my own, once.

                    RACHEL
          Anyway.  He walks up to her on
          lunch yard today.  And tells her...
          publicly...that they're 'breaking up.'

     Jackie's mouth drops.

                    JACKIE
          Oh, my God.

                    RACHEL
          Right.  Which is the whole point of
          this 'going out' thing, so one of them
          can dump the other one, and they can
          imitate the whole passionate adult
          soap opera tragedy, without ever
          having to actually date.

                    JACKIE
          She's devastated.

                    RACHEL
          Doesn't begin to describe it.
          I mean, you've got cancer, this
          is serious.

     Rachel GRIPS Jackie's arm.

                    RACHEL
          She spent an hour in the girls' bath-
          room, crying with eight of her closest
          friends, who are sending the message
          to every boy in the grade that Brad
          Kovitsky is yesterday's toast.

     Devours an entire cookie in one gulp.

                    RACHEL
          So here's the point.  I pick her up
          from soccer, she tells me the whole
          mess, and asks me what to do.

     How about that?

                    JACKIE
          And you said...?

                    RACHEL
          Beats me.  Ask your mom.

     Oh.

                    RACHEL
          So she's gonna.  Tomorrow.

     Leans closer.  Whispers...

                    RACHEL
          Don't fuck this up.

     INT. JACKIE'S KITCHEN - DAY

     Jackie and Annabelle are sitting at the kitchen counter with maybe
     twenty hardboiled eggs.  They are cracking the shells gently, and
     carefully peeling them.

                    JACKIE
          Well, did you really think you'd
          meet someone at eleven that you'd
          spend the rest of your life with?

     Annabelle keeps her eyes on her eggs.  A craftswoman.

                    ANNABELLE
          No, but I thought till Thursday.

     Oh.

                    JACKIE
          What's Thursd...

                    ANNABELLE
          A debate.  Man's inhumanity to
          woman.  He's pro women.  I'm con.
          Ms. Flannery is twisted.

                    JACKIE
          I could help with the debate.

                    ANNABELLE
               (glum)
          Great.

                    JACKIE
               (thinking it over)
          Actually.  I could only help him.

                    ANNABELLE
          Every time I'm on the lunch
          yard, and he's with twelve of
          his retarded dorkface little
          adoring out-crowd henchmen...

                    JACKIE
          You don't like his friends.

                    ANNABELLE
          ...they all yell 'There goes the
          Virgin Queen' or the 'Ice Princess',
          or some really clever cut like that.
          Like it hurts my feelings.

     They keep peeling eggs.

                    JACKIE
          You wouldn't kiss him, huh?

                    ANNABELLE
          Not with my mouth open.

                    JACKIE
               (softly)
          Good girl.

     Annabelle's eyes well up.  She covers by concentrating all the
     harder.

                    JACKIE
          And what do you do wh...

                    ANNABELLE
          I call him a fartface or a pervert,
          or something equally lame.

                    JACKIE
          You have to ignore him.

     And on this.  Annabelle looks up.

                    JACKIE
          He's not even there.  You don't
          see him, you don't hear him, you're
          just too much of a woman to bother
          with little boys.

                    ANNABELLE
          This is a joke, right?

     Jackie shakes her head.  Nope.

                    JACKIE
          All he wants is the attention.
          When he can't get to you, he'll try
          harder for a little while.  Then,
          he'll give up.  It'll be no fun.

     The kid blinks.

                    ANNABELLE
          You think Rache would do that?

     Takes Mom back a bit.  Enough for her daughter to notice.

                    ANNABELLE
          It's just she's younger.  Maybe
          she remembers how to do this.

     Jackie shrugs.  Maybe.  Annabelle studies her.

                    ANNABELLE
          This'll work, huh?

                    JACKIE
          Oh, yeh.

     Annabelle takes heart from her mom's confidence.  Nods, with her
     trademark determination.

                    JACKIE
          How many devilled eggs can
          you eat?

                    ANNABELLE
          Maybe twenty.

     Jackie surveys the table.

                    JACKIE
          We can always go to the store,
          if w...

     A sudden BANGING on the screen door.  They turn to see...

     ...a breathless six-year-old TUCKER through the screen.  The
     birthday boy at the recent party.

                    TUCKER
          Mrs. Harrison...?

                    JACKIE
          Tucker, is something wr...

                    TUCKER
          How tall is your tree?  The really,
          really, really, REALLY big...

                    JACKIE
               (shrugs)
          Why?

     Uh.

                    TUCKER
          How bad would it hurt?  If you
          fell off the top?

     EXT. YARD - DAY

     AERIAL VIEW of Jackie, Annabelle, Tucker and assorted neighborhood
     looky-loo kids from SEVENTY FEET in the air.  Everyone looks like
     TINY DOTS running around the lawn.  We realize that we are almost
     at the TOP of a giant EVERGREEN TREE.

     We see a patch of red.  And now a blue stripe.  The wind reveals
     more -- It's BEN CLIMBING to the very top of the tree.  The calling
     of his name becoming more and more faint in the distance -- His leg
     MISSES a branch -- causing a cluster of PINE CONES to FALL in front
     of Jackie -- she looks up screaming --

                    JACKIE
          BEEEENNNNNN!

     Jackie's POV -- Ben crouched at the top of the evergreen -- as the
     wind sways the tree perilously back and forth.

                    JACKIE
          Don't move!

     SMASH CUT TO LATER, as...

     An enormous CRANE moves through the sky.  Jackie holds tightly onto
     JESSICA, a diminutive five-foot-tall Firewoman, as they soar skyward
     towards Ben.  A slightly condescending tone to...

                    JESSICA
          That's quite a grip you have there
          Ma'am.  Do we have an issue with
          heights?

     Patronized the wrong gal.  In a crisis.

                    JACKIE
               (looking her up and
                down)
          I don't care if you're a dwarf,
          so long as you do your job.
          BEN!  I'M COMING!  STAY THERE!
          MOMMY'S COMING!

                    JESSICA
          Ma'am, my arm's going numb, maybe
          you could loosen your grip just a
          little.

                    JACKIE
          That's absolutely out of the question.
          BEN!  I'M HERE!

     The crane STOPS.  Ben has climbed to the top branches of the trees;
     they SWAY from side to side like a METRONOME.

                    JESSICA
          Hello Ben.  Your mother says you're
          real good at disappearing --

     Ben tries to climb a little higher -- Branches SNAP.

                    JACKIE
          Ben!  Mommy's so glad to see you -- Now
          stop climbing!
               (He keeps climbing)
          Ben listen to me...

                    BEN
          No!  I have to get there.

                    JACKIE
          Where Ben?

                    BEN
          Before you.

                    JACKIE
          Ben where do you have to get to?

                    BEN
          Heaven.  I have to tell him he's made
          a mistake.  He should take Grammy
          Martha first.  Or Grandpa Norman.

     Jackie's heart breaks, unable to speak.

                    JACKIE
          Ben.  God doesn't like visitors.

                    BEN
          How do you know?

                    JACKIE
          Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson.
          She does this twenty times a day.

                    BEN
          Oh.

     Jessica begins to crawl out to him on the limb.

                    JESSICA
          Oh yeh.  It's in our official manual.

                    JACKIE
          That's right, Ben.  That's why Firemen
          have giant ladders and climb up
          and down poles.  They're like...
          messengers... carrier pigeons...
          between heaven and earth.

                    BEN
          That's good cause we need to hurry.
          My mom doesn't have very much time
          left.

                    JESSICA
          Then you know what we should do?
          We should go to the Fire Station
          together and ring the firebell to
          get God's attention.

                    BEN
          Cause it's an emergency.

     Ben opens his arms, teeters, and Jessica HAS him.  She reaches him
     out, and...

     ...HANDS him to Jackie, alone in the cherry-picker.  Jackie GRASPS
     Ben, pulling him FIERCELY to her arms in a death grip.

     From down below, the kids CHEER.  The worst is over.

     HOLD on Jackie, clutching her baby for dear life.  Knowing it isn't.
     
     INT. BEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Jackie stands in the doorway watching her son -- her baby boy --
     sleeping.  She looks drawn, but even if her body would let her
     sleep she couldn't.

                    JACKIE
               (a whisper)
          God...I will do anything...I will
          go through any amount of pain you
          give me.  If you'll just let me
          see them grow up.

     A slow ragged breath.

                    JACKIE
          Is that asking so damn much?

     She leaves the room soundlessly.  Ben stirs.

     ANNABELLE'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

     Annabelle sleeps soundly in the glow of a night light.  Jackie
     appears, leaning down to rouse her gently.

                    JACKIE
          Annabelle...wake up honey...

                    ANNABELLE
               (sleepy)
          Mom?  What's wrong?

                    JACKIE
          Nothing sweetheart.

     Jackie sits on the edge of the bed, stroking Annabelle's head.

                    JACKIE
          I got Ginny Weintraub to come stay
          with Ben.

     Annabelle's puzzled look.  Why would you do that?

                    JACKIE
          How'd you like to go someplace
          special with me?  Right now.

     EXT. NORTH VALE STABLES - NIGHT

     The light of the full moon illuminates the night and we see Jackie
     and Annabelle sitting on a horse.  Annabelle in front, Jackie with
     a strong hold on her.  Both have their nightgowns tucked into their
     jeans, coats over them.

                    JACKIE
          Hold tight, sweetheart.

     She KICKS the horse forward and they HEAD OFF toward the rolling
     hills in the distance.  Jackie and Annabelle ride faster and faster
     along the trail.  Jackie has one arm firmly around Annabelle's
     waist and controls the horse with the other.  Jackie closes her
     eyes for a moment, allowing the wind to wash over her.  The smells
     and sounds of the night seem to free her, give her strength.
     Annabelle relaxes against her mother and giggles with delight.
     Jackie soon joins her, and the sounds of their laughter break the
     silence of the night.

     They come to a stop at the crest of a small hill and we now see the
     tears on Jackie's face.  Annabelle can't see, and stares out at the
     moonlit valley before them.

                    JACKIE
          I'm never, never going to forget this.

     Annabelle snuggles back.  Happy.

                    ANNABELLE
          Never say never.

     Jackie kisses the top of her baby's head.

                    JACKIE
          You're old enough to learn the
          loophole.  You can say 'never,
          never'.  If you mean it enough.
          To say it twice.

     Annabelle yawns.  So content in her mother's arms.

                    ANNABELLE
          I'll remember.  Always, always.

     So Jackie grips a little tighter.  Breathes a single word, just
     loud enough to hear...

                    JACKIE
          Promise.

     EXT. JACKIE'S HOUSE - DUSK

     Rachel and Luke heading up the path to Jackie's door.  It is early
     winter.  Stark trees, a light snow on the ground.  Rachel pulls her
     coat tighter around her.

     INT. JACKIE'S FRONT DOOR - DUSK

     Ben rumbling down the hall to the door.  Stands in front of it, as
     the bell RINGS again.

                    BEN
          IS THAT YOU?

                    RACHEL (O.S.)
          IT'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND, BIG GUY,
          OPEN UP.

     So he does.  Gives her a sweet hug.

                    LUKE (O.S.)
          Hey.  Remember me?

     He enters behind her.  SCOOPS his body in the air.

                    LUKE
               (John Wayne)
          Listen up.  That's a pretty big love
          you're givin' my best girl, pard.

                    BEN
               (Clint)
          Listen sideways.  I love her and
          you love her.  Now what are we
          gonna do about it?

     They follow Rachel down the hall...

                    LUKE
               (Mister Rogers)
          We'll share.  Like good neighbors.

     They enter the living room.  Annabelle sits sullenly in front of
     the TV.  Her overnight duffle and book bag and coat piled beside
     her.

                    RACHEL
          Hey, gorgeous, where's Big Mama?

     No answer.  Annabelle worried about something.

                    RACHEL
          She still packing for her trip?

                    ANNABELLE
          I killed my math quiz, A-minus.

     They slap FIVE.  Go through the ritual of a three-step black guy
     handshake.

                    RACHEL
          And...other things?  At school?

     Annabelle cuts a look in Luke and Ben's direction.  Please not in
     front of the menfolk.

                    RACHEL
          We'll talk.  I'll go check
          on Mom.

     Annabelle frowns at Mom's name.  Rachel strokes her.  Heads down
     the hall...

     Knocks at the open door to Jackie's bedroom, where Jackie is
     calmly, meticulously, laying out things beside her large open
     suitcase.  She waves Rachel in, and keeps working.

                    RACHEL
               (checking out the
                stuff)
          It's gonna be cool, huh?

     Bulky sweaters.  Wool things.

                    JACKIE
          I can never figure weather.  Last
          trip, I made all the wrong choices.

     Rachel and we have a better angle now.  Jackie looks awful.  Drawn,
     weak, masking pain with obvious courage.

                    RACHEL
          Bad day?

     Rachel sits on the edge of the bed.  Jackie turns away, goes to her
     open chest of drawers.

                    JACKIE
          Can't complain.

     Even her voice is carefully under control.  Awkward, Rachel looks
     around the room.  A stack of photo albums, scrapbooks, open.  Works
     in progress.

                    RACHEL
          Can I look at the pictures?

                    JACKIE
          It's a mess, right now.  That's
          my project when I get back.

     So quiet, we can hear a clock TICKING nearby.  Rachel's gaze
     returns to the bulky sweaters.  Holds there.

                    JACKIE
          See, I'm not going to Houston,
          after all.

     Like you obviously figured out.

                    JACKIE
          There's this clinic in Montreal.
          We've studied their process, we
          like their success rate...

     Two women nodding, in a calm, matter-of-fact way.  As if discussing
     recipes.

                    JACKIE
          They combine some compounds that
          have been getting results in France,
          with vitamin injections.  Seems to
          activate the chemo...

     Silence.

                    RACHEL
          So.  Hopeful.

                    JACKIE
          It's promising, this one.  We're
          upbeat.

     Rachel swallows.  She's out of words.

                    JACKIE
          I really look like shit.

                    RACHEL
          You look sick.  But you look...
          together.  Mentally tough.

                    JACKIE
          Yeh, that's bull.  I'm going for
          serene, they say some actually get
          there.

     A shrug.  The first bitterness to seep through.

                    JACKIE
          Prob'ly low percentage on mothers.

     She sits, unceremoniously, right on the floor.  Pantomimes a smoke.
     Rachel goes into her bag.

                    JACKIE
          You try to center on the big issues,
          y'know.  What it's all about.  What
          this whole trip has meant.  But then,
          the really big issues keep swamping y...

                    RACHEL
          Brad Kovitsky.

     Tosses Jackie a pack.  Matches next.

                    JACKIE
            You don't have any pot, I s'pose?

     Rachel's eyebrows head north.

                    JACKIE
          The primo stuff is great for pain.

                    RACHEL
          I think my 'primo shit' got left
          in my 'bellbottoms.'

     Jackie lighting up.  Deep soulful drag.

                    JACKIE
          So.  She ignores this little Kovitsky
          punk, takes the high moral ground...

     Reading Rachel's face.  Who is already wincing.

                    JACKIE
               (yeh)
          He's relentless.  A major asshole.

                    RACHEL
               (nodding)
          And you said...

                    JACKIE
          What else?  Keep on keepin' on.

     Oh.  Rachel tries to hide her disappointment.

                    JACKIE
          She has to stick with it.  Have
          the patience, the guts, to ignore
          the pain.  You disagree?

     Half a beat.  Rachel shakes her head, nope.

                    RACHEL
               (softly)
          Hey.  You oughta know.

     INT. LUKE AND RACHEL'S DEN - NIGHT

     Luke sits with Ben, building a gigantic magic castle from a million
     Leggos.  I's architecturally interesting.  Through the window
     behind them, a cold winter rain.

                    RACHEL (O.S.)
          God, sorry I'm so late...

     She is entering, peeling off her jacket.  Tired as hell.

                    RACHEL
          Duncan is doing his Himmler
          imitation on this gig.  I got
          yelled at for quitting at eight.

     Under Luke's patient exterior, the stress is showing.  As Ben
     watches, he replaces a key piece of the turret...

                    LUKE
          Yeh, well, I'll be up all night
          on this brief.  And then...

     He shoots her a really sorry look...

                    LUKE
          I've got a morning plane to Boston
          for the depo.  Back Sunday night.

     Wow.  They lock eyes in the bond of 'what are we gonna do?'

                    RACHEL
          No problem.

                    LUKE
          I made that paella you liked.
          It's on the stove.

     She kisses Ben's head, Luke's mouth, that one lingering a little.
     Then, down the hall to...

     ...the kitchen.  Annabelle sits with her homework stacked,
     untouched.  Staring out the dark window.  Clearly, this is worse
     than death.

                    RACHEL
          Lemme guess.  A bad hair day.

     Annabelle TURNS like a hunted animal...

                    ANNABELLE
          She told me to keep ignoring him!
          So I did it!

     Not a good result, huh?

                    ANNABELLE
          You know what that creep and his
          frogfaced footmen are calling me
          now?  In front of the whole world?
          Frosty, the Snow Bitch!!

                    RACHEL
          That's so weak.

                    ANNABELLE
          Here's weak...Mom said she was
          gonna talk to the teacher and
          Brad's parents!!  Can you believe
          the humiliation???

                    RACHEL
               Honey, she won't d...

                    RACHEL
          I told her if she pulled that,
          I'd kill myself, and she could
          go to my funeral for a change!

     For a change.  That's where this is coming from.  Rachel reaches
     her arms around her...

                    RACHEL
               (murmurs)
          Hey.  Hey.  I've personally never
          gone to a funeral.  And I'm not
          starting anytime soon.

     The phone begins to RING...

                    RACHEL
               (a whisper)
          Specially not in this family.

     Keep RINGING.  Rachel checks her watch.  Shit.

                    RACHEL
          Nine o'clock.  That could be your
          mom from Montreal.  Now you need t...

     But Annabelle BREAKS LOOSE from Rachel's arms and BOLTS out of the
     room.  Rachel watching in despair.  Lifts the phone on the sixth
     ring...

                    JACKIE
               (bright and soft)
          Hi.  How's the vitamins up there?
          Having big fun?

     INTERCUT throughout:  Jackie in a hospital gown.  At the window of
     her room, rain pouring down on Montreal.

                    JACKIE
          Eat your heart out.  Is Annabelle
          there?

                    RACHEL
          Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben
          first, it's past his bedti...

                    JACKIE
          How's she doing with Brad?

     A beat.

                    RACHEL
          Can I say one thing?  I mean, the
          last thing I want to do is inter-
          fere on the Brad thing, b...

                    JACKIE
          Thanks, but it's under control.

     A shorter beat.

                    RACHEL
          Yah?  Well, even the best mom in
          the world, the smartest, the wisest,
          whatever.  Needs to know when to
          find a Plan B.  Cos Plan A is not
          and will n...

                    JACKIE
               (tired, short)
          It's covered, okay?  I appreciate
          your concern.  Can I talk to her?

     And real quiet...

                    RACHEL
          I'll get Ben.

     INT. ANNABELLE'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

     Annabelle lies on her bed in darkness.  Clutching her pillow.
     Lights streams in as Rachel enters.  Sits on the bed, next to this
     furious child.  Puts the cordless phone by the pillow.

                    RACHEL
          Annabelle, I know you miss your
          mother.  So why don't you say hello.

                    ANNABELLE
          Why don't you say hello?

                    RACHEL
          Annabelle pick up the phone.

                    ANNABELLE
          Annabelle pick up the phone.

                    RACHEL
          That doesn't bother me.

                    ANNABELLE
          That doesn't bother me.

                    RACHEL
          You think this is funny?

                    ANNABELLE
          You think this is funny?

                    RACHEL
          No.  I think it's ugly.

                    ANNABELLE
          You're just a stepmother.  So stop
          bossing, cos nobody's listening!

                    RACHEL
               (even, in control)
          June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your
          Dad.  And then I will be your stepmom.
          And right now, I'm not looking forward
          to th...

                    ANNABELLE
          Suits me fine!

     Rachel cooks her head to one side, like she's seen Jackie do.

                    RACHEL
          Stepmother.  You think that means
          you can step on me?  Over me?  That
          you're one step ahead of me?  Well,
          you're not.

     Strong voice.  No smile at all.

                    RACHEL
          You know when girls grow into women?
          When they have to.  And this is your
          moment, kid.  Ready or not.

     Picks up the phone.

                    RACHEL
               (low)
          Your mama is in a hospital, far away.
          She needs you, right now.  She needs
          you to be big.  To put the kid aside,
          and help her get well.  Now.  Fucking.
          Do it!

     CLICKS the phone ON.  Hands it to her.

                    ANNABELLE
               (tears on her face)
          Hi, Mom.  How are you feeling?

     As Rachel leaves, silently, we...

     INTERCUT throughout:  Jackie at her clinic window.  Cellular at her
     ear.

                    JACKIE
          Darling, I've been thinking about
          our little Brad problem?  And I
          think it's time we move to Plan B...

                    ANNABELLE
          You cannot believe what he said,
          it was the worst instant of my
          total life on Earth!!

                    JACKIE
          I know.  I know how rough life can be.
          And how unfair.  So here's what we do.
          Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk
          straight up to that little jerk...

                    ANNABELLE
          And bring my knees up, real hard, yeh?

                    JACKIE
          No, that never solves anything.  You
          talk like the big girl you are.  About
          what you feel.  And how he's hurt you.
          You know?  You tell the truth.

     Nodding to herself.  Knows this is right.

                    JACKIE
          You use your words.

     EXT. SUBWAY CAR - DAY

     An actual SUBWAY CAR filled with PAIRS of animals, cats, rabbits,
     dogs, two horses peeking out a window, peacocks.  Noah's Subway, so
     to speak.

     Duncan and his client watch as Cooper assists Rachel, who SHOOTS
     the menagerie from low ANGLES.  At last, she lowers her camera.
     Check her watch.  Shoots Cooper a knowing look.  And HANDS HIM the
     camera.  WAVES to her subjects...

                    RACHEL
          I love you guys.  You're animals!

     And starts WALKING OFF down the tunnel.  Duncan looks at his
     watch, then JUMPS up, TEARS after Rachel, GRABBING her arm,
     SPINNING her around, he faces...

     ...someone ready for this.

                    RACHEL
          It's 1:45, I told you there's no
          one to pick up Annab...

                    DUNCAN
          But you're not done!

     She licks her lips.  Stands her ground.

                    RACHEL
          I've got it.  It's in the can,
          Cooper can wrap th...

                    DUNCAN
          We don't KNOW if you've got it, we
          haven't SEEN it yet!  Now go back
          and FINISH!

     Her glare says do NOT fuck with me.  The mother lion look we've
     seen on Jackie.

                    RACHEL
          Which part of no don't you
          understand?

                    DUNCAN
          Look, I will send a P.A. to pick
          up the children.  There are agencies
          that supply sitters, nannies...

                    RACHEL
          They're losing one mother.  They
          can't lose two.

     The bottom line.  He looks as freaked as she is determined.

                    DUNCAN
          You're making a career decision
          here, I would strongly sugg...

                    RACHEL
          Duncan.  I've got an even better
          idea...

     She leans forward.  In his face.  So she barely has to murmur.

                    RACHEL
          I.  Quit.

     A beat.

                    DUNCAN
          You can't do that, I won't let you!

                    RACHEL
          No, no, no, this is a job that's
          hard to keep, not a job that's
          hard to lose, can't be both.

                    DUNCAN
          Rachel, don't do this, you will
          never forgive yourself!

     She thinks that over.  For half a second.

                    RACHEL
          Actually.  I just did.

     And without further fond farewell...

     She is gone.

     EXT. CAR POOL LINE, ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

     The last cars are pulling away.  Some kids are still playing
     sports.  And sitting on the ledge by the flag pole...

     ...two children.  The little boy is reading his Garfield book for
     the three hundredth time.  His big sister is simply crying, openly,
     for a disinterested world to see.  A car SCREECHES up.  The driver
     BLASTS out the door, RUNS to us...

     Then crouches slowly.  At Annabelle's feet.

                    RACHEL
          Oh, baby, I'm so sor...

                    ANNABELLE
          IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT!!

     Rachel is dying inside.  Reaches to brush at Annabelle's tears, but
     the child SMACKS her head away.

                    RACHEL
          Ben, go sit in my car right now,
          and I will bribe you big time.

     Excited, he runs off.

                    ANNABELLE
          I did what she said.  I used my
          words, I told him what I felt,
          and they...

                    RACHEL
          ...laughed, yeh.  They laughed
          real hard.

     Annabelle nodding BIG, gulping back tears.

                    RACHEL
          That's because men can be scum,
          your precious father excepted,
          may you live to find one like him,
          it is damn hard.

     And wraps her arms around the girl...

                    RACHEL
               (looking around)
          Now is that little prick still here,
          because if he is, I'm gonna rip his
          fucking heart out!

                    ANNABELLE
          No, his mother's always on time.

     Great.

                    ANNABELLE
          And Mom says anger never, never
          solves anything.  It makes every-
          thing worse.

                    RACHEL
          That's because your mother is a
          fine person, finer than I will
          ever be.  Now, just this once...

     Just this once.

                    RACHEL
          If I tell you what to do.  Can we
          cut a deal?

     Annabelle stops crying.  This is what she has prayed for.

                    RACHEL
          Tomorrow is Friday, your mom comes
          home.  You tell her you did what she
          said.  It didn't work yet.  But you're
          gonna talk to Brad again on Monday.

     Leans close...

                    RACHEL
          And youdon't tell her.  What
          you're going to say.

                    ANNABELLE
          Not use my words, please!

                    RACHEL
               (smile)
          No, baby.  You're gonna use
          my words.

     The sun dawns.  On a child's face.  Rachel brushes the tears away.
     They won't need them anymore.

                    RACHEL
          Okay, let's start with looks.  I
          know he's handsome, but the best-
          looking people are so vain, there's
          always something they're insecure
          about.

     Annabelle shakes her head.  Nothing.

                    RACHEL
          Does he have zitz?  We can call
          him Pizza Face.

     Nope.  None.

                    RACHEL
          Help me here...

                    ANNABELLE
          Uh.  He thinks his nose is too
          big.  But it's not.

                    RACHEL
          Great.  Big ears, too?

                    ANNABELLE
          No.  But they stand out, a little.
          Like this.

     Shows how.

                    RACHEL
          Done.  He's a dead man.

     Rachel stands up.  Walks in circle, thinking.  Comes back.
     Strikes a pose.

                    RACHEL
          Monday lunch, you walk up with
          attitude, you hear me?

     Finger STABS out...

                    RACHEL
               (as Annabelle)
          Hey, Ear Boy!
               (does the ears)
          Listen up, Rhino Face, because I'm
          saying this one time!  So your
          pathetic, no-life, ass-kissing little
          groupies here, better take notes!

     Annabelle is swooning with joy.

                    RACHEL
               (as Annabelle)
          I dumped you, limp dick, when I
          got a peek at your deformed unit,
          which is sadly microscopic!

     Annabelle laughing, applauding.

                    RACHEL
               (as Annabelle)
          As for your pitiful knowledge of
          sex?  I'm not wasting my time with
          some loser who doesn't even know
          what snowballing is!

     Annabelle raises her hand.

                    ANNABELLE
          Uh.  What is it?

                    RACHEL
          Oh.  It's an incredibly disgusting,
          and not remotely sexy thing, that
          they described in a movie I'd never
          let you go to.  But it's real.  Does
          he have an older brother?

                    ANNABELLE
          In high school.

                    RACHEL
          He'll be impressed.  The clincher is,
          you walk away, then whip around...

     Like this.

                    RACHEL
          The guy I see is in the eighth grade
          at Prep School, and he laughs his ass
          off every time we talk about you.

                    ANNABELLE
          But Rache...

                    RACHEL
          A suitable boy, will be at this
          flagpole, on Monday, with a very
          expensive bike, and he will be a
          stone FOX if I have to call an
          escort service!

     The kid.  Is breathless.

                    RACHEL
          Now let's go stuff you full of
          junk food.

     Wraps an arm around her.

                    RACHEL
          I've had the worst day.  Till now.

     INT. NEWARK AIRPORT - DAY

     Arriving PASSENGERS are filling through the gate.  Last, is a female
     FLIGHT ATTENDANT, WHEELING a gray-faced Jackie in a collapsible
     wheelchair.  The woman leans to her...

                    FLIGHT ATTENDANT
          We'll get your bags, and the taxis
          are just...

     Jackie GRIPS the wheel, STOPPING them.  Stares, frozen, as across
     the way...three faces stare back.

                    RACHEL
               (sheepish)
          Surprise?

     And Jackie LEAPS out of the wheelchair, RUNS across the distance,
     runs to SCOOP her babies in her arms...

                    JACKIE
          It's a miracle!  I can walk!

     Annabelle laughs.  Ben covers Jackie with kisses.  Rachel watches.
     From the crowd.

     INT. JACKIE'S HOME - DAY

     Rachel carrying the suitcase, Jackie has each kid by the hand, as
     they troop through the house to arrive at...

     ...Jackie's bedroom.  Where Jackie freezes.  Her mouth OPEN.  For
     Rachel has...

     ...HUNG striking black and white PHOTOS of the children all OVER
     the room.  One is of Ben's FEET, left shoe on right foot and vice-
     versa.  Another glimpses Annabelle's beautiful FACE hidden in her
     hair.  Ben sitting in a cupboard.  Annabelle a bold ear of corn.
     Ben sitting on the bottom limb of the huge evergreen.  Annabelle
     kissing her horse's muzzle.

     Jackie just stands.  Trying not to cry.

                    JACKIE
          Okay.  These are good.

                    BEN
          I helped.

     She know he did.  Looks across the room at Rachel.  No more words.

                    BEN
          Let's go to the park!

     Jackie sighs.  Smiles down at him.

                    JACKIE
          I've got a lot of medicine in me,
          sweetie.  And I'm a little wobbly for
          driving or running ar...

                    BEN
          Rache can do that part.

     Jackie absorbs that.  And all it portends.

                    RACHEL
               (softly)
          Hon, maybe your mom would like t...

                    JACKIE
          ...go to the park.  In the worst way.

     Silence.

                    ANNABELLE
               (grins)
          Well, with Rachel driving.  That's
          how we'll go.

     EXT. PARK - DAY

     LONG ANGLE...five swings in use.  In four, the kids are pushed by
     moms or nannies.  In the fifth, Ben is pushed by Annabelle.  Guess
     who's going the highest.  PULL BACK to...

     ...two women on a bench.  Under a starkly bare tree.  Jackie is
     drinking in the air, the cold, the day.  Rachel watching that.

                    RACHEL
          Serene.  You're getting the hang
          of it.

     Jackie doesn't answer for a beat.  Almost as if she hasn't heard.

                    JACKIE
          Serene means you accept.

     Shakes her head.

                    JACKIE
          Part of me hasn't quit yet.  And
          the other part is still pretty
          outraged.
               (calmly)
          When it's not terrified.

     Watching the world of moms and kids.  Who are not terrified.

                    JACKIE
          I'm thinking.  Do I know you well
          enough to really chew you out?

                    RACHEL
          No.

     Jackie turns to her.  Diamond laser glare...

                    JACKIE
          Have you lost your mind?!  You fought
          years for that job!  And you quit??

     Oh.  That.

                    RACHEL
          It's just not the right time t...

                    JACKIE
          Do what you've worked your whole
          life to do?

                    RACHEL
          It was just a job, there'll be plenty
          of others.

                    JACKIE
          You mean, after I'm dead?

     Do you?

                    RACHEL
          Hey, you haven't quit on you, I'm
          sure as hell not gonna.  I just
          mean, I'm juggling a lot right n...

                    JACKIE
          Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into
          your house.  You've got that room
          downstairs with the treadmill Luke
          never uses anyway.  Don't lose your
          confidence.  Don't lose your edge.

                    RACHEL
          It's the same choice you made.

                    JACKIE
          Yes.  I made the choice that was
          right for me.  And I don't regret
          it.  But even for me, there were
          days when I felt so lost, so invis-
          ible.  And then I'd hate myself for
          the kids not being enough.

     Reading Rachel's face.

                    JACKIE
               (softer)
          I know you, huh?  The car pools,
          he measles, the PTA.  It's not
          gonna be enough for you in the long
          run.  You have to think long term.

                    RACHEL
          I just want to spend time with
          them when I'm not rushing or on
          the phone or tired or...

                    JACKIE
          That's motherhood.  That's the
          job, with or without a career.
          I'm telling you the biggest gift
          you can give them is your happiness.
          They need you to be happy.

     Can you hear me?

                    JACKIE
          Cause if you're not, the easiest
          person to  blame is the guy sleeping
          next to you.  And you'll push him
          away, and then hate him even more
          when he goes, until finally you have
          no choice but to leave.  And that
          can't happen.

     Rachel's turn to wonder.  She starts to say something, thinks
     better of it.  Asks instead...

                    RACHEL
          That's the bottom line, isn't it?
          I can't make a mistake.  Because
          it'll screw your kids.

     Glances over.

                    RACHEL
          My advice to you?  Don't die.

                    JACKIE
          Feeling the pressure?

     Rachel's eyes move across Jackie's face.  Then, out to Ben, on the
     distant swings.

                    RACHEL
          Last time I pushed him?  He said,
          'Higher, Rache.  It makes my penis
          sting.'

     Thin smile.  Now it's Jackie watching Rachel's profile.

                    RACHEL
          I'm gonna buy him that white dove
          for Christmas.  If I don't, you'll
          get him a fucking eagle!

     Jackie keeps watching her.  And in a quiet voice...

                    JACKIE
          Ben was born in two hours, went
          right to my breast and camped
          there for three days.  Always with
          this...mischievous look...

     Watches Rachel nodding, absorbing.

                    JACKIE
          Somehow, his blanket always looked
          like a cape, even the nurse said
          that.  He loves to hear that story,
          over and over.  How he was born a
          magician.

                    RACHEL
               (softly, never turning)
          And her...?

                    JACKIE
          Took 28 hours.  She just wasn't
          sure about entering this world.

     Watches the feeling well in Rachel's eyes.

                    JACKIE
          The doctor wanted to go in and get
          her, but I knew she'd come in her
          own time.

     Rachel nods.  It fits.

                    JACKIE
          That's who she is.  Don't let
          anybody rush her.

     Silence.  A murmur...

                    RACHEL
          I'll keep that in mind.

     Rachel settles back.  Her eyes now locked away somewhere private.

                    JACKIE
               (quietly)
          What?

     Rache smiles.  That Jackie sensed something.

                    RACHEL
          It's not about the kids.

     Looks over.  Decides whether to ask...

                    RACHEL
          That thing you said before.  Pushing
          the guy sleeping next to you away.
          Because of what you gave up for
          motherhood...

                    JACKIE
          Is that what he told you?

                    RACHEL
          He won't discuss it.  Just calls it
          history.

     A trace of edge to Jackie's smile.  But no real anger.

                    JACKIE
          Well, he got that part right.

     Looking.  Looking.


                    RACHEL
          So what's the part he got wrong?

     An urgency in that.

                    RACHEL
          I got all day.

     EXT. COURTHOUSE STEPS - TWILIGHT

     Luke and his bulky briefcase, coming down the stone steps two at a
     time, until...

     ...he sees her.  In her winter coat.  Smoking as if it could keep
     her warm.  And despite her tension, he grins, heads over.

                    LUKE
          What a great surpri...

                    RACHEL
          Hold your applause.  We're not
          having fun, here.

     And from her face.  She means every word.

                    LUKE
               (concerned)
          Is Jack okay?

     Great.  Just what she wants to hear.

                    RACHEL
          Oh yeh, she was cracking me up.
          Dishing details of her sordid
          little divorce.

     Ah.  A beat.  To assess the damage.

                    LUKE
          And you freaked.  A little.

     Hey...

                    RACHEL
          Just like to make sure.  That your
          past.  And my future.  Are real
          different.

                    LUKE
               (quietly)
          Well, they will be.

                    RACHEL
               (hard and low)
          Imagine my relief.  So what's for
          dinner?

     He sighs.  Jesus.

                    LUKE
          Why in the world would she t...

                    RACHEL
          You took a fishing trip with the boys.
          Liked it so much, you took another.

                    LUKE
          I needed some time away.

                    RACHEL
          ...while she watched the kids.  Then,
          you booked this flat in Paris for your
          family's summer.  But she said...

                    LUKE
               (weary)
          '...the kids have camp.  Their friends
          are here.  Over there, I'll just be
          shopping in a language I don't even
          know.  My life, and the kids' lives,
          aren't here to service your mid-life
          crisis.'  Did it go like that?

     It did.  People are passing them.  They do not notice.

                    LUKE
          She called it a fight.  The fight.

                    RACHEL
          What do you call it?  You told her
          you had doubts.

     He looks around.  People are moving on.  Toward their drinks, their
     dinners, their lives.

                    LUKE
          Can we go sit somewhere?

                    RACHEL
          Let me put it this way.  Hell, no.

     And takes out her cigarettes.  Her fingers fumble slightly.  It
     isn't the cold.

                    LUKE
          I told her I loved her.

                    RACHEL
          By way of saying you were unhappy.

                    LUKE
          Restless.

                    RACHEL
          Excuse me.  'Things are so confusing
          for me, Jack.  Our life feels too
          comfortable, too safe, too predict-
          able.  It's a partnership, it's
          juggling schedules.  When I think of
          playing that out, every day, for the
          rest of my life...'

     Dead at his eyes.  And he nods.  Once.

                    LUKE
               (softly)
          '...I don't know if I can make it.'
          That's what I said.  But I didn't
          leave.

                    RACHEL
          No, she threw you out.  What a
          difficult woman.

     Pulls out her box of matches.

                    RACHEL
          So now I get to wait...

     A single match...

                    RACHEL
          For the first sign.  The first
          fishing trip...

     STRIKES it.  Shields it from the wind.

                    RACHEL
          What do you figure, Luke?  When
          am I too old to be exciting?  When
          your daughter brings home her college
          roommate?

     Lights her cigarette.  As he watches.

                    LUKE
               (softly)
          That's a pretty ugly thing you
          just said.

                    RACHEL
          No, here's ugly.  'I love you, babe.
          It's just our life together I'm not
          so sure about...'

     Big draw.  Never wavering from his eyes.

                    RACHEL
          'But keep dancing, and if you're
          lucky, I might just never leave,
          who knows?'

                    LUKE
          That's not us.

                    RACHEL
          Because you've changed so much.

     He puts his hands on her, gently.  But she flinches.  So the hands
     come away.

                    LUKE
          You want me to show you the future.
          Well, I can't darlin'.

     I can't.  She searches the lovelight in his eyes.  As if she could
     weigh it.

                    LUKE
          We make our lives, one step at a
          time.  We do the best we can.  The
          truth about the future?  A promise.
          Is only a hope.

                    RACHEL
          How about the promises we make to
          our kids?  About their future.  Do
          we shrug those off, just that easily?

     That slows him down.

                    RACHEL
          Maybe Annabelle deserves to find
          out who really broke up her family.
          While her mom is still around.

     Stops him.  Cold.

                    RACHEL
               (quiet)
          Hey.  Just a thought.

     Flips her cigarette to the gutter.  Shrugs...

                    RACHEL
          You got one less for dinner.

     Takes a step back.  Only one.  But it registers.

                    LUKE
          Where you goin'?

                    RACHEL
          I'm gonna get me a drink.

     Nods, to herself.

                    RACHEL
          And I'm gonna drink it alone.

     And she walks off.  Slow.

     EXT. CAR POOL LINE, ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

     Ben alone in the back seat.  Reading his beloved Garfield book.
     Shift ANGLE to see...

     ...the women standing by the car.  Rachel looks a little anxious...

                    RACHEL
          You really didn't have to come,
          you know.  I'd have brought them
          straight t...

                    JACKIE
               (staring at something)
          Who in the world is he?

     See now, across the way.  A gorgeous BOY, dressed cool, stands
     holding an expensive bike.  And chatting happily with Annabelle.
     In the distance, other kids pretend they aren't watching.

                    RACHEL
          Looks nice enough to m...

                    JACKIE
          He looks familiar.  Did he do a
          Calvin Klein ad?

     Across the way, the boy leans, kisses Annabelle sweetly on the
     cheek.  Waves to her.  Peddles off.  In distance, kids are dying.
     Annabelle pretends not to know that.  Just walks casually toward
     us, but as she approaches, she can't help breaking into a RUN,
     straight...

     ...into RACHEL'S ARMS.

                    ANNABELLE
               (breathless)
          It workeditworkeditworked!  Omigod,
          you can't believe the look on his
          face!!!

     SQUEEZING Rachel tight enough to crush her bones.  And although
     Rachel hugs back, although she kisses Annabelle's hair...

     Her eyes are locked to Jackie's.

     Houston.  We have a problem.

     EXT. JACKIE'S YARD - DAY

     Rachel alone by the weathered redwood swing and slide set.  She
     is pacing in a circle, looking like a kid waiting to see the
     principal.  Sucking her cigarette like smoke was oxygen.  She picks
     a bottle of beer off the grass.  Twists the top.  Settles awkwardly
     on the seat of the taller swing.

     HEAR the screen door open.  Bang shut.  Rachel takes a sip.  Before
     she looks up...

                    JACKIE
               (low, calm)
          Now we're going to have a fight,
          you and I.

                    RACHEL
               (barely audible)
          Are we.

                    JACKIE
          And I'm going to win.

                    RACHEL
               (straight to her eyes)
          Don't be too sure.

     No anger in Jackie at this moment.  The ferocity of that mother
     lion.  The strongest face we'll ever see.

                    JACKIE
          Now, 'limp dick', I know.  What.
          Is 'snowballing'?

                    RACHEL
          It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...

                    JACKIE
          Because there'll be, oh, 20 or
          30 mothers phoning me in the
          next hour or so.  And they'll b...

                    RACHEL
          Give 'em my number.

     Jackie on the prowl around this swing.  Stalking her prey.

                    JACKIE
          Actually.  They'll want Annabelle's
          mother.

                    RACHEL
          Is that what you're worried about?
          Looking bad at the PTA?

                    JACKIE
          You are defending what you did?

                    RACHEL
          Right down to the ground.  Let's
          get to it.

     Not quite what Jackie expected.

                    JACKIE
          You put filth in my child's mouth.

                    RACHEL
          Aw.

                    JACKIE
          You had her lie about that...
          that fancy-boy model!

                    RACHEL
          Worked.  Like a charm.

     Jackie cannot even believe this.

                    RACHEL
          She was beaten, and bloodied, and
          it was going to go on, uni...

                    JACKIE
          So you became the hero.  And I
          became the schmuck.

     Straightening her spine...

                    JACKIE
          You taught my child that I am some
          limp dick loser.  Who didn't care
          about her pain.

                    RACHEL
          That's not wh...

                    JACKIE
          You think I didn't have some dirty
          words for that little putz?  You think
          I couldn't figure out some low blows?

                    RACHEL
          You weren't passing 'em out.

                    JACKIE
          Well, maybe your version of growing
          up is 'Just win, baby'.

     Stalking.  Closer.  Fierce.

                    JACKIE
          Mine.  Is a little different.

     Right there.  At the swing.  In her face.

                    JACKIE
          See, in that crisis, I saw an
          opportunity.  For some real growth.

                    RACHEL
          Oh please.

                    JACKIE
          Shut the fuck up.  I didn't go
          behind your back.

     The one scored.  Rachel sips her beer.

                    JACKIE
          Doing the right thing.  Knowing who
          you are, inside.  Not caving to peer
          pressure, or lowering yourself to that
          level, steering your own course...

                    RACHEL
          She wasn't steering her own course,
          she was steering yours.

                    JACKIE
          Well, that's what parenting is about,
          little girl.  They are pleading to
          know how they are supposed to do it.
          And you sure as hell showed her.

     Silence.

                    JACKIE
          And there will come another moment.
          When the stakes are really there.
          And she will look back on this.  And
          remember how good it felt.  How easy
          it was.

                    RACHEL
          And she'll fight back again.  God help
          me, what have I done.

     Jackie's voice drops.  The softness makes it somehow more
     menacing...

                    JACKIE
          You've turned her into you.  And
          I may not get another chance.  To
          turn her back.

                    RACHEL
               (suddenly fierce)
          That's what it is.  And that's all
          it is.

     The hand with its cigarette STABS out...

                    RACHEL
          You won't get the chance.

     Jackie back on her heels.  Thinking.  A mile a minute.

                    JACKIE
          You've got a point there, for a
          change.  Oh, yes you do.

     HER finger stabbing out.

                    JACKIE
          You didn't get morning sickness for
          seven months, you didn't breast feed
          till your nipples fell off, you didn't
          spend every minute of every day
          thinking and planning and knowing that
          your decisions were shaping the people
          they were going to be...

     And now Rachel.  Has nothing to say.

                    JACKIE
          You are gonna be taking Ben's training
          wheels off.  You are the one my little
          girl will confess her first love to.
          You will see them married, you will
          play with their babies, you fucking
          BITCH, I hate your GUTS!

     The blast washes over Rachel.  And in the silence...

                    RACHEL
          Now you're talking sense.

     She looks down at her beer.

                    RACHEL
          All year long, I've been watching how
          you do this.  The worries, the sacri-
          fices, the signals you give them...

     Thinks.  Really thinks.  Wants so much to say this right.

                    RACHEL
          And I admire you.  More than you'll
          ever believe.  And yet...this...
          thing...has been growing.  Inside me.

     Looks up.  Straight to her eyes.

                    RACHEL
          For better or worse.  I'm not you.

     And so she stands up.  The swing shimmies in her wake.

                    RACHEL
          I can't live my life channeling the
          One True Mom after you're gone.  I
          can't do it.  I can't do it.  I can't.
          Do it.

     Sets the beer down.  Stabs out her smoke.

                    RACHEL
          We have to deal with that.

     And walks off, slowly.  Across the yard.

     INT. INDOOR RIDING RING - TWILIGHT

     Huge indoor space.  Wood-sided walls, dirt floor.  High corrugated
     metal roof, with birds flying, roosting in rafters.  A little GIRL,
     under the keen eye of her TRAINER, puts her mount through its
     paces.  In the cold air, steam rises from the horse's body.  It's
     late, no one else around.  TRACK now...

     ...down a walkway.  Toward the stables.  A barn cat is crouched,
     stalking prey.  We hear a soft voice, speaking.  One we know...

                    LUKE (O.S.)
          It was like telling her...

     See him now.  Standing awkwardly, against the side of a stall.

                    LUKE
          ...that I didn't love her anymore...

     See the horse, still steaming.  Standing patiently.

                    LUKE
          ...if I could be sure I'd always
          stay.

     Circling the horse now, we see Annabelle's back.  She is slowly
     brushing out the sweat mark.  Where the saddle used to be.  Her
     movements are stiff, mechanical.  The soft voice continues...

                    LUKE (O.S.)
          She said, 'This thing you call a
          partnership.  The schedules, the
          chores, all the things we have to
          work out...'

     Our ANGLE CIRCLING to see at last Annabelle's face...

                    LUKE (O.S.)
               (softer)
          '...for the kids.'

     The tears that stand in her eyes.  The set line of her small mouth.

                    LUKE (O.S.)
          '...that's the life I dreamed of.
          And it's all I ever wanted it to be.'

     She swallows.  Because she will not cry.

                    LUKE (O.S.)
          That's the kind of person your mom is.
          She's the best.

     Annabelle says nothing.  She drops to her knees.  Begins to clean
     out one of her horse's hooves with a metal pick.  The only sound
     against the stillness.

     And her father watches.  His heart pounding.

                    LUKE
          I complained a lot, baby.  We couldn't
          travel, we'd lost our privacy, our
          chance to do things on the spur of the
          moment.  To live for...ourselves.  The
          way we'd started out.

     He goes to her.  The sound of his feet on the straw.

                    LUKE
          And she said.  Sounds like you'd be
          happier.  If the kids weren't around.

     Crouches down.  Very close to his child.

                    LUKE
          I said.  I love them more than
          anything.  But sometimes... I do
          miss what I've lost.

     Annabelle stops working.  Turns her faces away.

                    LUKE
          She said she could never feel that
          way, not for one single second.

     So he leans closer.

                    LUKE
          She didn't want to be with someone.
          Who could.

     Silence.  He's staring at the back of her head.

                    LUKE
          You know, this horse smells
          really bad.

                    ANNABELLE
          There's worse things.

     At least she can talk.  If only just above a whisper.

                    LUKE
          Do you know why I never told
          you all this before?

     A beat.  She doesn't look at him.

                    ANNABELLE
          Sure.  You wanted me to blame her.
          Instead of you.

     Waiting to hear...

                    LUKE
               (very softly)
          That's right.

     She hears honesty.  And heartbreak.  It makes her turn...

                    ANNABELLE
          How come you're telling me now?

     He gets lost.  Looking in those eyes.

                    LUKE
          I don't want to be wrong anymore.

     I don't.

                    LUKE
          I want to say I'm sorry, because I am.
          And let you hate me.  If you have to.

     She swallows hard.  Her eyes moving over his face.

                    LUKE
          See that feeling?  Where you feel
          two different things at once?
          That's a grown-up thing.  It's
          not a lot of fun.

     She shakes her head very slightly.  And her eyes water.

                    LUKE
          Know why your mom never told you?

     She doesn't.

                    LUKE
          She knew that you and her were
          so...solid.  Nothing could rock that.
          But she didn't want to risk...

     The hardest thing.  He's ever had to say...

                    LUKE
          ...your hating me.

                    ANNABELLE
          Cos she loves you.

                    LUKE
          Cos she loves you.  She wanted you
          to have a daddy to love.  Even if
          he didn't...completely...deserve it.

     Now the tears in his eyes.  And she's watching that.

                    LUKE
          You know how much love that is?
          That she has for you.

     Do you.

                    LUKE
          There's going to come a moment.
          When she'll really need you to
          give that back.  And you're just
          the girl that can do it.

     The way he says this.  Makes her ask...

                    ANNABELLE
          Now do I know when?

     He reaches.  First time.  Strokes her hair.

                    LUKE
          That moment will come.  And your
          heart is going to whisper, 'here
          it is'

     Winds his fingers.  Around her hand.

                    LUKE
          And you'll come through.

     She stares in his eyes.  And dead straight.

                    ANNABELLE
          If I miss it, daddy?  You clue
          me in.

     Okay, he nods.  That's a plan.

     INT. BAR - NIGHT

     The dimly chic bar.  With its soft upscale buzz.  Where Jackie
     told Luke she had cancer.  Tonight, she waits alone.  Watching the
     entrance.  Nursing her drink.  And then...

     ...Rachel comes into the place.  Spots Jackie across the room.
     Weaves her way through the tables.

     And she is there.  Slipping into her seat.  Not knowing what to
     say.

                    JACKIE
          Thanks for coming out.

                    RACHEL
          Neutral ground.  What's up?

     Jackie stares evenly.  Her chin rests across the back of her
     knuckles.  She looks tired, but okay.  Fueled by adrenaline.

                    JACKIE
          Luke called.  He says you're
          checking out.  Of the Heartbreak
          Hotel.

     The waitress appears.  Rachel too locked into the moment to notice.
     So...

                    JACKIE
          She likes a Stolie, no ice.

                    RACHEL
               (softly)
          Double.

     As the woman leaves...

                    JACKIE
          What's this about?  Because
          we fought?

                    RACHEL
          Don't flatter yourself.
               (beat)
          I always liked that line.

     Signs.

                    RACHEL
          I love Luke, I love the children.
          But there is more to life than
          even love...

                    JACKIE
          No, there isn't.

                    RACHEL
          And I have looked down the road.
          At what my life will be.  And I
          can't handle it.

     Jackie unblinking.  Focused, strong.

                    JACKIE
          What do you see?  Down that road.

     No answer.  Then...

                    RACHEL
          I never wanted to be a mom.  Then,
          sharing it with you was one thing.
          Carrying it alone, the rest of my
          life...

                    JACKIE
          Is scary.  But you want it.  Gimme
          some truth here.

     The Stolie arrives.  They wait a beat.  The waitress disappears.

                    RACHEL
          Well, it's the Jack Kennedy Syndrome,
          huh?  You die young, you always look
          golden.  Perfect.  The memory kind of
          burnishes the image, and...

                    JACKIE
          Come on, a wuss like me?  The stiff
          who wouldn't help her own daughter
          fight back?

                    RACHEL
          Maybe I was wrong on that one.

     That sits there.  In its sincerity.

                    JACKIE
          Well, maybe you weren't.

     And so does that.  Tears are forming in Rachel's eyes.  Here, in
     this public place.

                    RACHEL
          Look, when I said I couldn't channel
          you.  That didn't mean I wouldn't give
          my right arm to do just that.

     Shakes her head.

                    RACHEL
          Maybe I don't want to be looking over
          my shoulder.  Every day for twenty
          years.  Knowing someone else would
          have done it right.  The way I can't.

     Jackie waits.  Thinks.

                    JACKIE
          Trade you a smoke.  For a secret.

     The way she said that.  Something weighty behind it.  So Rachel
     reaches into her purse.

                    JACKIE
          You know, I lost Ben awhile back?
          In a supermarket.

     Rachel's hand freezes.  In mid-course.

                    RACHEL
          You're lying.

                    JACKIE
          I lost him.  I was panicked.

                    RACHEL
          You are lying, you never lost that
          kid for 4 seconds, you could find him
          from a coma, there is no WAY!

                    JACKIE
               (smiles)
          I was running around like a chicken
          with my head chopped off.  Doing my
          imitation of you.

     Rachel still not buying...

                    RACHEL
          Ben never mentioned it.

                    JACKIE
          He only remembers I found him.  My
          point is, telling you this story would
          have been the kindest, most helpful
          thing I could ever have done for you.

     The smile fades.

                    JACKIE
          Why didn't I?

                    RACHEL
          Uh.  You hate my guts?

     Passing the cigarettes over.

                    JACKIE
          We were competing.  Even then.

     Yes we were.

                    JACKIE
          Instead of being partners.  Watch-
          ing each other's back.  Seeing things
          were covered.

     Pulls out a smoke.  Offers the pack...

                    JACKIE
          You're not scared you'll think you
          don't measure up.  You're scared
          they'll think it.  That's the JFK
          thing, yeh?

     Rachel takes one.  Eye contact holding.

                    RACHEL
          With good reason.  They fucking
          worship you as it is.

                    JACKIE
          What do I have that you don't?

                    RACHEL
          Everything.  You're...the Earth
          Mother incarnate...

                    JACKIE
          You're the hip and fresh.

                    RACHEL
          You ride with Annabelle...

                    JACKIE
          You'll learn.

                    RACHEL
          You know every story, every wound,
          every memory, their whole life's
          happiness has been wrapped up in
          you, every moment...

                    JACKIE
          I have their past.

     STRIKES the match.

                    JACKIE
          You.  Have their future.

     Rachel stunned.  By the simplicity of it all.  Slowly, she leans to
     accept Jackie's flame.

                    JACKIE
          Don't you get it?  You look down the
          road to her wedding.  You're in the
          room alone with her, fitting her veil,
          fluffing her dress.  Telling her no
          woman was ever that beautiful.

     Tears now.  Standing in two pairs of eyes.

                    JACKIE
          And your fear is.  She'll be
          thinking.  I wish Mom were here.

     Jackie lights her own.

                    JACKIE
          And mine is.  She won't.

     Her hand trembles as she takes a drag.

                    JACKIE
          Now that's enough fear for either
          one of us to kill the other.  And
          no jury in the world would convict.

     Jackie raises her glass.

                    JACKIE
          We're guilty, girl.  Of being human.
          And we can't forgive ourselves.

     Holds it forward.  In a toast.

                    JACKIE
          But I forgive you.

     And slowly, Rachel lifts her own glass.  CLICKS it with Jackie's.

                    RACHEL
          Don't rush me.  I'm deciding.

     SLOW DISSOLVE TO...

     INT. JACKIE'S LIVING ROOM - CHRISTMAS MORNING

     White Christmas outside the window.  Richly trimmed tree, presents
     everywhere, carols softly playing.  The whole nine yards.  Luke and
     Ben standing at a wrapped bird cage, where a dove is cooing inside.
     Annabelle is setting out the cocoa with a uniformed NURSE.

     Rachel enters.  Kisses Annabelle's head.

                    RACHEL
          I'm gonna check on Mom.

     Goes down the hall, every emotion in the world is playing across
     her face.  Into...

     INT. JACKIE'S BEDROOM

     Jackie lies on her death bed.  She is beautiful and near the end.
     Despite the IV tube, the monitor, she's gotten to serenity after
     all.  As close as any of us will ever get.

                    RACHEL
          Hey, gorgeous.  Time for the
          presents?

     Jackie licks her lips.  Pretty dry.  Rachel takes a cotton lemon
     swab from the nightstand.  Tenderly, cleans Jackie's mouth.

                    RACHEL
          Now Edna says you short-changed your
          last meds.  You can do presents and be
          comfortable at the same time, y'know.

                    JACKIE
               (clears her throat)
          Just want to be a little sharper.
          For a few minutes.

     A few minutes.

                    JACKIE
          Some things to say.  To the kids,
          huh?

     Smiles.

                    JACKIE
          Then, bring in the presents.  We'll
          have big fun.

     Rachel can't really bear this.

                    RACHEL
          You know, there's nothing you
          have to say.  Because they know
          your heart.  You don't have t...

                    JACKIE
          Just sit me up.  Nice and tall.
          Bring Benjamin first.

     Staring at each other.  Then Rachel reaches her arms around
     Jackie, and as gently as she can manage, lifts her to a full
     sitting position.

                    JACKIE
          Scrapbook.

     Rachel brings the big book.  Lays it on the bed.  And goes.

     Jackie begins to turn the pages.  Her life with these children
     passing before her eyes.  No tears.   No smile.  Just full
     attention.  Fingertips touch the one she was looking for, as...

     The door OPENS.  Ben, hesitant, enters alone.  His mother's face is
     fine and strong and smiling.

                    JACKIE
          Find the bird cage?

                    BEN
               (standing there)
          Rache says it's from you.

                    JACKIE
          Well, don't make him disappear
          before I see him.

     Ben nods.  Okay, I won't.  She glances to the scrapbook...

                    JACKIE
          Oh, look at this.

     And forgetting his uneasiness, he runs over, climbs ONTO the bed.
     Jackie doesn't wince, doesn't even blink.  Nothing for his memory
     bank but smiles.  He looks at the photo...

     ...Jackie holding a spunky newborn.

                    JACKIE
          That's you and me.  Our first photo
          as a couple.

     He nods.  Really staring at it.

                    BEN
          Did you know I was good-looking
          right away?

     She reaches to hold his face in her hand.  Stares in his eyes.

                    JACKIE
          This good-looking.  Was beyond
          my imagination.

     She leans.  Kisses his lips lightly.  How many more times will she
     get to do this?

                    JACKIE
               (a murmur)
          So what do you think we're gonna
          talk about?

                    BEN
               (straight back)
          You dying.

     She nods.  Her smile is right there.

                    JACKIE
          The secret of it.  That only
          magicians.  Can ever understand.

     His eyes brighten.  The sadness pushed aside.

                    JACKIE
          See, when we die.  Our body goes
          away.  Our body.  But we...we are
          not our body, are we?

     He doesn't know.  Maybe he thought we were.

                    JACKIE
          If a soldier loses his legs in a
          war.  Is he the same guy?  Sure
          he is.

                    BEN
          But you can still see him.

                    JACKIE
          Half.  Of him.

     This is so fucking hard.  But her eyes stay dry.

                    JACKIE
          Dying.  Is where the whole body
          goes away.  So you can't see any
          of it.  But...

     Rests her hand tenderly.  On his hair.

                    JACKIE
          What do magicians know?

     Leans forward.  Here's the secret...

                    JACKIE
          Just because you can't see it.
          Doesn't.  Mean.  It's gone.

     Does it?  And Ben smiles.  He is inside the secret.

                    JACKIE
          The world.  Thinks I'm gone.  But
          only the magician.  Knows better.

                    BEN
          So where are you?

     She was waiting for this.  For a long time.  She wraps her hand
     around his fist.  And puts their hands against his heart.

                    JACKIE
               (a whisper)
          Right here.  Right here.  Inside
          the magician.  Shhhh.

                    BEN
          Can I talk to you?  When you're
          there.

                    JACKIE
          Always.  Always.  And you won't
          hear a voice.  But in here.  You'll
          know.  What I'm saying.

     Yes, you will.

                    BEN
          It's not good enough.

                    JACKIE
          No, it isn't.  Because it isn't
          everything.  And we want every-
          thing, don't we?

     He nods.  They do.

                    JACKIE
          But God does let us keep the one
          best thing we have together.  The
          one best thing we've always had.
          Know what it is?

     He doesn't.  But he wants to.

                    JACKIE
          I love you.  And you love me.

     Comes closer.  Nose to nose.

                    JACKIE
          It's worth a lot.  Will you keep it?

     He answers.  With a kiss.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

     Luke and Annabelle are doing a hugely complex jigsaw puzzle.  Ben
     runs in, falls on his knees by the puzzle.  Without looking at
     Annabelle, he tells her...

                    BEN
          Your turn.  It wasn't bad.

     Annabelle looks straight to her dad.  There is a moment, a silence,
     that no one else could ever understand.  She leans to him and
     whispers...

                    ANNABELLE
          Here it is?

     His eyes water.  He takes her in his arms.  Whispers close to her
     ear, only the words...

                    LUKE
          Here it is.

     She smiles at hi.  Fear gone, filled with resolve.  Gives him a
     kiss.  Rises, to...

     ...follow Rachel down the hall.  Rache wraps an arm around her big
     girl.  No words, except a murmured...

                    RACHEL
          You can do this.

     Voice cracking.  She's not as good at it as this girl's mother.

                    RACHEL
          You can do anything.

     At the door.  Open it, and...

     INT. JACKIE'S BEDROOM

     ...Annabelle enters alone.  The door closes behind her.  Her eyes
     lock with her mother's.  No words.  Annabelle's eyes filled with
     tears, and Jackie's arms...

     ... REACH out, and Annabelle RUNS to them.

     They hold each other.  For a forever moment.

                    ANNABELLE
          I don't want to say goodbye.

                    JACKIE
          Don't. Take me with you.

     And Annabelle looks up.  Tears on her face.

                    JACKIE
          Thank God.  I got to see you.
          Grown up.

                    ANNABELLE
          I'm not.

                    JACKIE
               (very softly)
          Let me be the judge of that.

     And Annabelle climbs onto the bed.  Their hands never stop touching
     each other.  Saying I love you.

                    JACKIE
          There's an amazing thing when a
          woman has a daughter.  One day you
          look up, and you see...a sister.
          Someone.  You can say.  Anything to.

     Anything.

                    JACKIE
          I wrote a whole lot of letters.  To
          each of you.  And the envelope says
          when to open it.  Like, which
          birthday.  Or...when you get your
          driver's permit.  First time you see
          Rome.  Things like that.

     Things like that.  Annabelle is beginning to lose it now.  So
     Jackie says only...

                    JACKIE
          Keep Ben's for awhile, okay?  Until
          he's old enough to not open them all
          at once.

                    ANNABELLE
          Until he's old enough to read.

     Tears on Annabelle's face.  Her mom wonders...

                    JACKIE
          Are you afraid for me?  Where
          I'm going.

                    ANNABELLE
          Yes.

                    JACKIE
          Don't be.  I'm going.  Where we
          all go.  Now how can that be bad.

                    ANNABELLE
          I'll miss you so much.

                    JACKIE
          Good.  That's very good.

     She nods, yes it is.

                    JACKIE
          What you're grown-up enough to
          know.  Is that people.  Can do
          two things at once.  Okay?

     She brushes at her baby's tears.  Then tastes her wet fingertips.
     Mmmn, surprisingly good.  Annabelle sort of smiles.

                    JACKIE
          You can miss me.  And.  Take me
          with you.

     Hold the child's face.  In her hands.

                    JACKIE
          When you're in trouble.  Have me
          there.  When you fall in love.
          Have me there.  You can.

     Said with such absolute assurance.

                    JACKIE
          That's how we go on, you know.
          Forever.  Because someone takes
          us along.

     Annabelle swallows hard.

                    JACKIE
          On your wedding night.  When your
          babies are born.  I want to be
          there.  Will you take me?

     A straight question.  It needs an answer.

                    ANNABELLE
          Always, always.  Always.

     A sigh.  A shared smile.

                    JACKIE
          You made my life wonderful.

     You.

                    JACKIE
          Take that with you, too.

     Hold.  On Annabelle.

     INT. JACKIE'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT MORNING

     The presents are here now, they fill up the room, spill over the
     bed, where both children sprawl.

     ...Ben RIPPING the shit out of wrappings like a wolverine,
     Annabelle carefully saving her gift paper as if she were going to
     hang it in the Louvre.  She holds a tank top up to her chest, for
     her Mom's approval.  Jackie's not sure.  Rachel handing up more
     boxes, Luke in charge of bagging trash...

     Ben's white dove, flying free around the room, zipping and diving.
     No one cares.  It's Christmas.

     HOLD.  Hold.  And CROSSFADE TO...

     EXT. CHAPEL - NIGHT

     Family and friends are leaving the wake, exiting the softly-lit
     chapel into a snowy night.  They are saying goodbyes, kissing one
     another, going to their cars.  And saying her last goodbye...

     ...Rachel turns to Luke.  Whispers, close to his ear.  He looks at
     her for a beat, then leads Annabelle and Ben toward the car, as...

     Rachel goes back into the chapel.  Alone.

     INT. FUNERAL PARLOR

     The room is nearly dark.  One soft spot plays on a simple CASKET.
     No canned organ music, no sound at all.  As Rachel enters.

     She goes to the casket.  Stares down at it for a beat.  And just
     above a whisper...

                    RACHEL
          See, I told you I'd do this.

     Only...

                    RACHEL
          Only.  Now I don't know what to say.

     Her hand reaches out.  A finger absently traces the edge of the
     wood.  It seems a gesture of unconscious affection.

                    RACHEL
          You'd have written it down, so you
          wouldn't blow it.

     A slight smile.  Here's where the love shows.

                    RACHEL
          Maybe we should change places.

     Nods slightly.  Maybe we should.  She takes a step back now, to a
     waiting chair.

     Sits.  Her hands folded in her lap.  Thinks.

                    RACHEL
          Well.  We were less than friends, I
          guess.  And more.

     More.

                    RACHEL
          We were never...girlfriends, we
          never dished.  That wasn't.  What
          we had.

     No apology there.  It's just the truth.

                    RACHEL
          We had some battles, man, they
          were...world class, huh?
               (beat)
          And I don't regret a one of them.

     Sad little shrug.

                    RACHEL
          I miss them.

     Thinking.  Of how much more she'll miss.

                    RACHEL
          We've got our secrets, we have.
          And I'll keep 'em if you will.

     Crosses her arms.  Lost in the moment.

                    RACHEL
          But I wish we had one more night.
          In that little bar, remember?
          Remember that toast?  Sure, you do.

     Her voice wavers.  But the eyes are dry.

                    RACHEL
          Know what?  I forgive me, too.
          See?  You're the magician.

     A murmur...

                    RACHEL
          Don't worry, partner, I've got
          your back.  We're covered.

     It's what she came to say.  CROSSFADE TO...

     INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

     Lights and music and laughter.  They're in black tie tonight.  It's
     a wedding party.  Up on the stage, at the head table, some guy is
     finishing a toast, and as everyone ROARS and CLAPS...

                    BEST MAN
          ...so TO THE BRIDE!  Thank GOD
          she's more than he deserves!

     Everybody shouts THE BRIDE.  Everybody drinks champagne.

     And the bride stands up. In her white gown.  In her hand, an
     envelope.  She goes to the mike, and waits for the raucous cheers,
     the calls of SPEECH!, to die down.

     Leans to the mike.  Flushed and happy.  And, oddly, nervous.

                    RACHEL
          Now I know the tradition, so
          this isn't a toast.  At least...
          not for me.

                    RACHEL
          The guest list is 114.  But we
          all know there's one more here,
          tonight.  Because...

     Looks down the table at her children.  Dressed to kill.  Enjoying
     the party.

                    RACHEL
          ...my two sidekicks there always
          bring her along.  Wherever they go.

     Right?  Right.

                    RACHEL
          So Jackie and I were sitting
          around.  On New Year's Eve.  And
          she said, 'You're not gonna talk
          at my funeral, are you?'

     And now.  It is quiet indeed.

                    RACHEL
          And I said, 'I've never been to
          a funeral.  I'm not sure I'll know
          how to act...'

     Her sweet smile.  Keeps the mood right.

                    RACHEL
          '...but I'll prob'ly sneak into
          where you are.  Just before it's
          over...'

     Nods to herself.  Fights back the feeling of that moment.

                    RACHEL
          '...say something.  Just to you.
          Get the last word in, when you
          can't talk back.'

     There is laughter in this room.  Gentle, loving.

                    RACHEL
          So she says, 'No way.'

     Holds up the envelope.  Holds it tight.

                    RACHEL
          She wrote this.  She sealed it
          up, I didn't see it.  She made
          me promise to read it.  At the
          wedding.

     And slowly, Luke begins to CLAP.  And others join.  And when it
     stops...

                    RACHEL
          I told her she'd better make it
          dirty, or make it funny.  Because...
          no way...on my wedding...

     No way in hell.

                    RACHEL
          ...could she make me cry.

     APPLAUSE.  They are loving it.

                    RACHEL
          She says, 'It's a deal'.

     The band plays an impromptu FLOURISH.  Rachel begins to carefully
     tear open the envelope...

                    RACHEL
          Now, if it's too raunchy, we may
          have to excuse the kids...

     SHOUTS from everyone, ESPECIALLY the children.

     She has it open.  She looks at it.

     And everything.  Stops.

     The world watches her sway, watches her eyes fill as she stares at
     the small card in her hand.  She can't believe this...

                    RACHEL
               (mouths to herself)
          You promised.

     The tears are welling.  Everyone SCREAMS for her to read it.  She
     leans to the mike, shaking her head...

                    RACHEL
          It's...no big thing, really...
          it's just...five words, it's...

     The place goes happily UP FOR GRABS.  A joyful RIOT of demand.
     Tears STREAMING now, Rachel fumbles to pull up her white beaded
     bag.  As she puts the card inside, we alone can read the words...

     MY BABIES.  ARE SO LUCKY.

     HOLD on this.  And...

     FADE TO BLACK.  ROLL END CREDITS.
