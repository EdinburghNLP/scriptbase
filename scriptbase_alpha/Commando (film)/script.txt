                         "COMMANDO"
          BLACK SCREEN. One word explodes towards us with cold
          brutality: COMMANDO. It FADES... leaves us in darkness.
          And we HEAR a growing ROAR... a frightening RUMBLE.

                         FADE IN

          EXT. SUBURBAN CUL-DE-SAC - DAY 1

          TIGHT ON the churning compactor of a garbage truck.
          The CAMERA PULLS BACK and we SEE the truck, battered
          and olive-grey. A bored garbage man with a kerchief
          over his mouth hangs on the back of the truck as it
          moves along the street.

          INT. BEDROOM - CLOSE ON THE BED - DAY 2

          As LAWSON awakes with a start. He's late 30's, a little
          worn. He shakes his WIFE.

                         LAWSON
          What's that?

                         WIFE

                         (BARELY AWAKE)
          Unnn...sounds like...

                         (STIFLING YAWN)
          .the garbage men.

                         LAWSON
          On Tuesday?

                         WIFE

                         (YAWNING)
          Maybe they changed the
          schedule...
          Lawson listens to the noise as it APPROACHES, finally
          throws his feet into his bedroom slippers.

                         LAWSON
          Shit.

          INT. LAWSON'S HOUSE - PANTRY 3

          He runs into the pantry, dragging several ungainly
          plastic trash bags.

                         A85

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         2

          EXT. LAWSON'S HOUSE - DAY 4

          The truck SOUND is CLOSER now. We can SEE it at the
          end of the long driveway.
          Lawson flings the green plastic bags into two battered
          and half-full metal cans, starts running down the
          driveway.

                         LAWSON

                         (SHOUTING)
          Wait a minute, wait a minute!

          END OF DRIVEWAY - DAY 5
           The truck stops at the bottom of the driveway. Lawson
          stumbles his way towards it, smiles.

                          LAWSON
          I was afraid you'd miss me --

                         REVERSE ANGLE 6
          COOKE -- The man behind the truck -- pulls an Ingram
          submachine gun INTO VIEW. At the same moment, the cab
          of the garbage truck is kicked open and DIAZ, the
          driver, leans out, similarly armed.

                         COOKE
          Don't worry-we won't.
          And they cut Lawson down, the bullets raking across his
          body and the cans.

                         LONG SHOT 7
          Lawson falls back, spread-eagled. The garbage cans,
          pierced and leaking, roll TOWARD THE CAMERA, blocking
          our view just as Cooke moves close to administer a
          coup de grace.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. AUTOMOBILE DEALERSHIP - DAY 8

          FORRESTAL grins INTO THE CAMERA.

                         FORRESTAL
          You ain't seen nothin' yet.

          8 Cont.
          CAMERA ADJUSTS TO SHOW us that Forrestal is just now
          closing the trunk of a big new Cadillac. He's showing
          it to Diaz, who nods and makes noncommital NOISES as
          Forrestal continues the hype.

                         FORRESTAL
          (as trunk closes)
          Hear that sound? American
          workmanship. You think the
          Japanese invented that? Bullshit
          We did...sure, we lost it for a
          while-but we got 'it back.
          Diaz gets into the car.

                         FORRESTAL
          Sure, get in...comfy, right? I
          know what you're gonna say...
          it's cloth. But take it from
          me-you don't want leather, it's
          hot, it cracks, it's trouble.
          And look at the head room.. .you're
          not gonna have a problem...
          Diaz starts the engine.

                         FORRESTAL
          Go ahead, start it up. Hear that?
          That's power-that's performance
          .that's -- Jesus Christ --
          Forrestal has said this last because Diaz has thrown
          the car into reverse, knocking down a big display.

                         FORRESTAL
          Hey!

                         ANOTHER ANGLE 9
          Diaz slams the car into forward, hits the accelerator
          and ROARS across the display room floor.
          The car SLAMS into Forrestal, flinging his body across
          the hood. The car continues on, CRASHES through the
          outside window and disappears down the street.

          EXT. FISHING BOAT - NIGHT

          Dangling working lights illuminate the night. The
          tuna fleet is in.

                         11

          DOCK - CLOSE ON BENNETT
          mid-thirties, well muscled, BENNETT helps another
          worker wrestle a net of fish into a hold, then he
          wipes his brow and shouts over the. noise.

                         BENNETT
          That's all for me, Les.
          Les nods. Bennett steps off the boat, crosses over
          another boat and steps onto his boat.

                         12

                         BENNETT'S BOAT
          Bennett starts his boat, revs the throttle, then pulls
          away from the other boats. The wind whips his hair
          as he cruises out into the night.

                         FULL SHOT
          The boat moves away from us, then WHOOM, the boat
          EXPLODES into a fireball, sending debris high into
          the air.

          EXT. DOCK AREA - NIGHT 14

          A man comes out of the shadows on the dock and watches
          the explosion, the fiery lights splashing onto his
          face. It's Cooke - the "garbage man."

          EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY

          MAIN TITLES BEGIN...and along with them we HEAR MUSIC.
          The CAMERA SKIMS OVER snow-capped peaks, pine trees
          twinkling dew in the morning light.
          Then we SEE it: An 80's version of a log cabin...with
          crisp, clean lines...energy efficient and snug.

                         A85

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         5

                         ANOTHER ANGLE 16
          as a giant FIGURE descends from the mountains behind
          the house balancing a giant log on his right shoulder
          and carrying a chain saw in his left hand.
          This is COLONEL JOHN ALEXANDER MATRIX. He's in his
          mid-thirties ...a man of raw power and vitality...and
          something else: Joy. Joy, and a sense of calm.
          Matrix reaches a shed behind the cabin. He puts down
          the log and chain saw, then picks up firewood and begins
          to SPLIT it with awesome single swipes of an axe.

                         INTERCUT:

          LOW ANGLE - HOUSE 17
          as a shadow comes stealthily alongside the house and
          begins to slowly and cautiously advance on Matrix.

                         INTERCUT:

          MATRIX AND APPROACHING PERSON 18
          Matrix doesn't turn or otherwise seem to see the other
          person...but he reacts to little things:

          A. A TWIG
          cracks.

          B. A SQUIRREL
          scampers away, startled.

          C. SOME PEBBLES
          roll away.

          D. A GATE
          responds with a faint creak while:

          E. THE AXEHEAD
          reflects a dull, indistinct figure approaching
          Matrix from behind.
          None of the above escapes matrix's eye...and then, at
          the last possible second, he WHIRLS and confronts:

                         A85

          NEW ANGLE 24 s
          Matrix sweeps up the intruder-his eleven-year-old
          daughter, JENNY. She laughs as he tickles her.

                         JENNY
          Dad... Dad... put me down.
          She tickles him back on his neck and ribs...he laughs,
          puts her down.

                         MATRIX
          I surrender, I surrender.
          He raises his hands, open, trusting. Instantly she
          attacks again, then runs like hell as he pursues her,

          MUSIC CONTINUES.

          EXT. ROADSIDE ICE CREAM STAND - DAY 25

          Matrix's Blazer is parked here. Father and daughter
          sit across from each other-she has a cone, he has a
          dish. He uses his spoon to steal some of her flavor
          and jimmies...he gets away with this twice before she
          pokes him on the nose with the cone. He wipes ice cream
          from his face.

          EXT. CABIN STREAM AREA - DAY 26

          Matrix and Jenny are trout fishing in a beautiful
          stream. A deer tentatively approaches and matrix and
          Jenny take food from a knapsack and hold it out for
          the deer. The deer comes closer, takes the food from
          them, then licks their hands.

                         MATRIX 26-A
          shows Jenny karate moves. She tries a move on him
          and he pretends she's knocked him over.

                         MATRIX 26-B
          gives Jenny a piggyback ride over the bridge that
          crosses the stream, as they head back to the cabin.

          INT. CABIN - DAY 27

          Matrix goes to open the refrigerator in his cabin a
          stops. Taped to the door is a cutout of a heart:
          Jenny is peeking at Matrix from around the corner of the
          kitchen. He sees her, he smiles, and they meet and hug.

          MUSIC AND TITLES END.

          INT. HOUSE DINING ROOM - LATER - DAY 28

          Matrix sits at the table as Jenny serves lunch. The
          view through the expansive picture window is breathtaking.
          Matrix leafs through some of Jenny's rock'n'roll
          magazines.

                         MATRIX
          When I was a boy and rock and
          roll came to East Germany, the
          communists said it was subversive...

                         (SLIGHT SMILE)
          .They were right...

                         (BITES INTO

                         SANDWICH JENNY

          .What's in this?

                         JENNY
          You don't want to know.
          Suddenly Matrix gets an odd look on his face ...he stands,
          cocks his head.

                         JENNY
          What's wrong?
          He shushes her, puts his hand up to block the sun as he
          peers through the picture window. Now Jenny -- and the
          audience -- can SEE what matrix's keen senses have
          already heard-an approaching aircraft.

          MATRIX'S P.O.V. - HELICOPTER 29
          with U.S. Army markings, coming towards the house...
          then veering off for a landing.

                         JENNY
          You said you wouldn't go away
          again. You said you were through --

           Promise.

                         THE COPTER 31
          It lands. Three men get out.
          GENERAL FRANKLIN KIRBY is in the lead. He's in his early
          50's, fit, energetic -- and, as we can SEE -- the pilot
          of the craft. He's wearing rugged Army Class "C's."
          The two young soldiers with him are HARRIS and JACKSON.
          They wear BDU's and carry carbines. At a look from
          Kirby they fan out, and watch the cabin.

                         KIRBY 32
          Kirby approaches the cabin.

                         KIRBY

                         (CALLING OUT)
          John, come on out. It's Kirby.

                         MATRIX
           (o.s.)
          I know.
          Startled, Kirby whirls to see Matrix standing behind him.

                         KIRBY
          Silent and smooth...just like
          always.
          He smiles and he and Matrix come together and shake hands.

                         MATRIX
          I better be. You taught me.
          He affectionately squeezes Kirby's shoulder.
          Jenny comes out of the cabin toward the two men.

                         KIRBY
          I need to talk to your dad, Jenny.

                         JENNY
          No way, Jose.
          Matrix gives her a sharp look and Jenny grudgingly goes
          back inside. Kirby and Matrix begin to walk as clouds
          billow high above the mountaintops around them.

          You've made enemies all over the X
          world, John. It could be the
          Syrians, the South Africans, the
          Russians-or a terrorist group.

          They're gonna find you.
          Matrix looks toward the cabin. Jenny is watching him
          through a window. Matrix turns back to Kirby and they
          begin walking back to the cabin.

          MATRIX - LATER 37
          watches the chopper lift off and fly away. Jenny,
          subdued, comes out of the cabin.

                         JENNY
          Is it bad?

                         MATRIX

          Then it can't be bad.
          She smiles.
          An intense look comes over Matrix's face, then
          -- In a BLUR, he sweeps up Jenny in his arms just
          before machine gun fire BLASTS the cabin. The VOLLEY
          OF FIRING SHATTERS the windows and RIPS OPEN Harris'
          chest, his blood SPLATTERING against the cabin.
          .Matrix, still clutching Jenny, DIVES through the door
          into the cabin and HITS the floor. Jackson CATCHES
          a round in the shoulder, SPINS to the ground, then
          crawls through the door after Matrix.
          The three of them lie on the cabin floor as the FIRING
          CONTINUES to BLAST AWAY at Harris' body, the rounds
          SMACKING into the side of the cabin.
          Then the firing stops. Silence.

          EXT. CABIN - DAY 38

          He races to the shed, unlocks it, goes inside to a
          high-tech cabinet and opens it.
          Inside is an H&K assault rifle, two big banana clips of
          ammunition and a Baretta JS pistol. Matrix pulls
          the weapons out and readies them.

          Jackson peers out the window, sees nothing, then edges
          back to the floor. Two hands WHIP a garotte around his
          neck and CHOKE the struggling Jackson to death.

          hears a THUMP and sticks her head out from under her
          bed to look, but sees nothing. Suddenly, footsteps
          approach her bedroom door. She pulls her head back
          under the bed just as two boots enter her bedroom.
          A knife is attached to one of the boots.

          Matrix puts the pistol in his waistband and SLAMS
          home a clip in the rifle. He RACES out of the shed,
          RUSHES to the cabin and OPENS the backdoor.
          Jackson, garotte still around his neck, falls lifelessly
          through the door STRAIGHT INTO THE CAMERA.
          Matrix ducks as Jackson GLANCES off him and CRUMPLES
          to the ground.

          Matrix, H&K rifle held ready, silently enters, then
          moves carefully through the cabin. He peers into the den
          and sees Diaz, one of the men who killed Matrix's men,
          sitting in a chair, looking at Jenny's

                         QÏ¿½91

          Diaz.

                         MATRIX
          Where is she?
          Diaz smiles and puts his feet up on a table.

                         DIAZ
          Mellow out, man. We can't talk
          business with you waving guns
          in people's faces.
          Matrix puts the rifle against Diaz's forehead and COCKS
          the trigger. The smile vanishes from Diaz's face.

                         DIAZ
          She's safe, Major. Whether
          she stays that way.is up to
          you. My people got some
          business with you...
          Matrix hears a NOISE outside, glances out the window
          and sees two vehicles RACING away from the house.

                         DIAZ
          .and if you want your kid
          back, you gotta cooperate.
          Right?

          Wrong.
          Matrix levels the H&K and BLASTS Diaz in the chest.
          Diaz and the chair are JERKED violently backward.

          Matrix JUMPS out of the cabin and RACES to the BLAZER,
          its hood up. He checks the engine.
          Torn wires stick up, the distributor cap is disconnected
          and broken.

          He looks down the mountain and sees the vehicles winding
          along the mountain roads.
          Matrix slams the Blazer's hood...gets inside...puts his
          weapons on the seat...then releases the brake. Then,
          one hand on the wheel, the other on the door frame, he
          begins to push the car.
          He steers it not towards the dirt road, but towards the
          shoulder where a steep incline leads downward. Since
          the Blazer is pointed the wrong way, Matrix is pushing
          it uphill-the effort is incredible... the veins on his
          neck stand out...with a SCREAM, he puts everything he's
          got into it... and finally it begins to roll downwards.
          Matrix leaps in. Snaps on the driver's shoulder belt...
          reaches over and wraps the passenger belt around his
          body as well.
          The Blazer rolls over the edge.

          Matrix fights to control the wheel. A low-hanging

          It barrels down the mountainside, out of control,
          smashing through trees, bounding off rocks, dropping
          like a stone.

          INT. BLAZER 48

          Matrix is taking a terrible beating. But he's almost
          down to the road...ahead of the black vehicle!

          WIDE ANGLE - WINDING ROAD 49
          The two vehicles narrowly miss each other-the dark
          car almost spins out.

                         THE BLAZER 50
          It careens past the other car, slams into a huge boulder
          -- flips -- ROLLS OVER AND OVER.

          The wrecked Blazer is BURNING, then suddenly EXPLODES.
          The CAMERA HOLDS ON this, what looks like Matrix's
          funeral pyre.
          Then we SEE movement and SEE a bloodied and injured
          Matrix crawling away from the intense fire.
          He stops and looks back at the destroyed Blazer.

                         WIDER ANGLE 53
          A large group of armed soldiers start to surround
          Matrix.
          He stands up, cut, bleeding. The lead man approaches
          to frisk him.

          Matrix ELBOWS him in the stomach, DRIVES his fist into
          the man's Adam's apple, PULLS HIM DOWN, CRACKS the man's
          vertebrae, grabs the dead man's rifle and SLAMS the butt
          against the face on the man closing on him. The man's
          jaw SHATTERS.
          But three more men are immediately on Matrix and they
          wrestle him to the ground. He forces his way up again, the
          three men still all over him.
          Matrix's eyes suddenly WIDEN as he looks at two boots with
          an attached knife, then up at the man standing in them.
          It's Bennett, the man we saw die!

          Henriques' eyes roll back in his head, blood trickles
          out of his mouth, his body goes limp and he falls
          against Matrix.
          It's happened so quickly none of the other passengers
          have noticed it.
          Matrix throws the blanket over Henriques' body, looks
          around, then quickly FORCES Henriques' neck down
          toward his chest.

          CRACK.
          Matrix stands and opens the overhead luggage rack. He
          picks up the blanket covered body and puts it in the
          overhead rack. The 2ND STEWARDESS comes by.

          Sir, can I help you with that?

          Matrix slows down, then begins to track Sully as Sully
          follows the girl.

          Cindy enters the parking garage and approaches the
          passenger side of her ragtop Sunbeam Alpine convertible.
          She unlocks and opens the door, leaving the keys in
          the lock, then she LOWERS the top.
          The LOWERING of the top REVEALS Sully facing her on the
          other side of the car.

          Yeah, herpes.
          Sully's smile disappears. He looks at her, takes
          his sunglasses out of his coat pocket, nuts them
          back on, then turns and walks off.
          Cindy watches him to make sure he leaves. All of a

          Knees shaking, Cindy steps aside.
          Matrix leans into the car, grabs the passenger seat,
          YANKS it out and places it on the ground at Cindy's

          of a three-story open vaulted area. In addition
          to the glass elevator, several tiered steps and
          banks of escalators run up and down the levels.
          Lots of decorative banners in hot colors decorate
          the open area. The top level is particularly active...
          restaurants, bars, video parlor, movie theatre. It's
          the hub of valley nightlife, lots of shoppers and
          kids just hanging out.
          Matrix and Cindy exit from the elevator onto the
          top level next to the wide-open vaulted space.
          Matrix immediately searches with his eyes for Sully.
          She takes a quick step to get away, but Matrix
          immediately GRABS her arm and PULLS her back toward
          him so they are now nose to nose. He motions to

          Matrix anxiously glances at his watch, then looks up
          toward the bar. Cindy comes out into the doorway
          where he can see her. She glances behind him, then
          helplessly looks right at him.
          Matrix, noticing her glance behind him, turns around.
          Five security guards are now approaching him.

          Sully moves toward Cindy. at the doorway. Just as he
          is about to say something to her, he hears a commotion
          and glances outside.

                         MATRIX
          Matrix turns from the guards to point at Cindy in the
          bar and he suddenly sees Sully approaching her.

                         BAR
          Sully looks out toward the commotion and suddenly

          Matrix, seeing him run, turns back to the guards
          advancing on him and SMASHES the lead guard (Biggs)
          right in the face.
          Biggs is BLASTED backward into the other guards,
          KNOCKING two of them down.
          Matrix sees Sully running and then looks where's he's
          headed.
          A phone booth.

          Matrix SCREAMS.

                         MATRIX

          NO!!!
          He jumps over the railing, LEAPS across an open chasm,
          DROPS eight feet toward a stairway, then RUSHES upward.
          Sully gets in the phone booth and quickly drops in a
          quarter. In the b.g., Matrix is RACING right toward
          the booth!
          Sully tries to dial as fast as he can. His face starts
          to CONTORT as he sees Matrix getting CLOSER and CLOSER.
          Sully's face is wet with sweat.
          Sully pulls out his gun and FIRES through the windowpane
          at the steadily looming Matrix. He misses. He won't
          get another chance.
          Matrix PICKS UP THE ENTIRE PHONE BOOTH, RIPS it from
          the wall and SMASHES it against the railing.
          People all over the Galleria begin to SCREAM.
          The Latin man dashes out of the bar with his gun drawn.
          Two real Los Angeles POLICE OFFICERS, racing up the
          escalator with their guns drawn, see the Latin.
          Cindy drops to the ground as the Officers aim at him.

                         OFFICER
          Freeze!!
          The Latin SHOOTS away at the Officers, BLASTING one in
          the chest and KNOCKING him rolling and tumbling backwards
          down the escalator.
          The other Officer FIRES AWAY at the Latin, hitting him
          twice. The Latin SLAMS agains the railing, the briefcase
          bursting open.

          Thousands of bills come rushing out of the briefcase
          and begin drifting downward.

                         LATIN 118
          The Latin, blood oozing out his stomach and eyes
          drifting in his head, reaches over the railing to grasp
          futilely at the money. He reaches too far.

                         SHOOTING UP 119
          The Latin drops over the third floor railing, falling
          right through the drifting bills and CRASHES to the
          floor.

          MATRIX AND SULLY 120
          Matrix tries to force open the broken phone booth door
          to get at Sully, but the bloodied Sully crawls out the
          other way through a broken window pane, hangs from the
          railing and drops to the stairwell below.
          People continue to SCREAM and hug the floor.
          Sully turns around and BLASTS a shot at Matrix above.
          It misses.
          He RACES down the stairwell, stepping on the huddled
          bodies.
          A security guard RUSHES him and Sully BLASTS him dead.
          Matrix, running along the third level, sees Sully jump
          off the stairwell and get into a glass elevator. It
          starts to descend.
          Matrix looks desperately around, looks at one of the
          giant decorative banners spanning the ceiling, jumps
          onto the railing and tears loose the banner's end.
          The LAPD cop kneels and aims his gun at Matrix and
          prepared to fire.
          Cindy is running right at the cop.

                         CINDY
          Don't! d!
          Matrix JUMPS, hanging onto the banner.
          Cindy KNOCKS the cop's aim away. The gun FIRES,
          missing Matrix.

          Matrix swings down to the lower level and CRASHES RIGHT
          THROUGH THE GLASS into the elevator with Sully.
          The cop comes up from the ground and looks at Cindy.
          She looks back at him uncertainly. He starts to bring
          the gun toward her and she moves quickly to a door
          marked "Stairwell" and disappears.

          INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT 121

          Matrix and Sully are both lying bloodied and dazed in
          the elevator. It descends silently, the two men lying
          in the broken glass.

          INT. GALLERIA PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT 122

          The elevator reaches the parking garage and the doors
          open. Sully crawls out and dazedly begins to trot toward
          his car. Seconds behind him, Matrix stumbles and chases
          him.

          Sully SHOOTS WILDLY out onto Sepulveda, BLASTING his

          Cindy watches him zoom by. She looks down the block.
          Now the cop is RUNNING toward her.
          Matrix RIPS out onto Sepulveda. Cindy races out onto
          the street, her hands held up to stop him.

          Cindy has slid down in her seat and covered her face
          with her hands. She now opens her fingers, peeks
          through, then lowers her hands. She looks at Matrix.

          Corvette. BAM!
          They swerve around another curve. Matrix brings the
          car up close again. Sully half glances back and
          fires a wild shot.

          BLAM!
          The windshield on the Sunbeam SPLINTERS. Matrix
          floors the car and completely SMASHES it into the back

          Sully's car SKIDS off the road, FLIPS a couple times,
          then CRASHES into the inside face of the cliff.
          Matrix and Cindy SKID off the road and CRASH into the X

          Gun in hand, Sully crawls dazedly out of the destroyed
          car. Matrix approaches, kicks the gun out of Sully's
          hand and picks the gun up.
          Matrix empties Sully's pockets and finds his wallet
          and a motel key. He picks Sully up, an ankle in each
          hand, so that he's holding Sully upside down. He
          begins walking with him.

          head against the fender, leaving another dent in the
          already beat-up car.

          drops a foot, Matrix's left arm drops a little, then

          Yes, Matrix...

                         MATRIX

          He drops a SCREAMING Sully and Sully CRASHES to the
          rocks below.

          Cindy is looking at her sunbeam, which is smashed to
          shit, as Matrix approaches.

          Now you don't have a car...
          Matrix looks at Sully's car, which is lying on its
          side. He PUSHES INCREDIBLY HARD against it and it
          SLAMS to the ground right side up.

          They get into Sully's beat-up car and Matrix starts
          the engine and puts the car in gear to drive away.

                         CINDY
          Wait a minute...
          Matrix looks at her.

          Waves crash against a rocky shore. Arius' boat settles
          next to a dock and several Latinos (in guerrilla
          fatigues) secure the boat's lines.
          Arius, Bennett and Jenny exit from the boat and walk

          soldiers.
          Arius and Jenny walk down a marble passageway, passing
          several lavishly decorated rooms.
          Arius stops her in front of a door and unlocks the door.

          furnishings, the windows boarded over.
          Arius LOCKS the door again, then looks up and down at
          Jenny. She takes a few hesitant steps backward.
          He gazes at her, then steps out into the hallway and
          CLOSES the door.
          Suddenly, the lights in the room go out, plunging
          Jenny into darkness.
          Jenny moves against a wall, slides to a sitting position
          on the floor and begins to shiver from the cold.

          I'm sorry I got you involved
          in this.

                         CINDY
          Then why won't you tell me
          what it's about.
          Matrix reaches into his pocket, pulls out his wallet,
          opens it and hands it to Cindy.

                         MATRIX
          It's about her.
           Cindy looks at a photo tucked into a wallet, clear
           plastic photo insert.

          Matrix nods.

                         MATRIX
          Some people are using her
          to force me to do a job.
          If I don't get to her soon,
          they'll kill her.

                         CINDY
          Did you do the job?

                         MATRIX
          No. I knew they'd kill
          her even if I did it. The
          only chance she has is if
          I get to her before they
          know what I'm doing.

          She died when Jenny was born.
          I was in Laos when it happened,
          so I came home intending to
          raise her.

                         (PAUSING)
          But on her third birthday I
          was in Lebanon. When she went
          to grade school, I was in Angola.
          When she had the measles, I was
          in Pakistan. And now she's
          been kidnapped because of me.

          Why were you always travelling?

          They quietly and cautiously approach one of the motel
          rooms. The drapes are closed.
          Cindy stays a few feet back as Matrix, gun drawn,
          slowly EASES Sully's motel key into the door lock, then
          QUICKLY OPENS the door.

          Matrix, gun out in front, BURSTS into the room.
          No one's there.
          Cindy nervously peeks her head into the room, sees it's
          okay, joins Matrix inside, closes the door and locks
          the chain. They look around the room.
          Sully's suitcase is spilled open on one of the beds.
          Beer cans and fast food containers lay open and
          the bureau drawers are ajar.
          Matrix goes to the suitcase and searches through it.
          Cindy checks out the bureau drawers.
          Matrix finds nothing in the suitcase. He looks under

          Cooke looks back through the door at her. Matrix, at
          the inside edge of the door,is holding_his gun,
          ready to fire. Matrix can only see Cindy.

          Cindy moves away from the door. Matrix tenses, ready

          bed, suitcase and fast food containers.
          The shower SOUNDS continue to echo from the bathroom.
          Cooke cautiously enters the doorway. WHAM!
          Matrix SLAMS the gun against the brawny Cooke's head.
          Cooke crashes back against the wall, but doesn't go
          down. He grabs Matrix's gun hand by the wrist and
          the two of them STRUGGLE for the gun.
          BLAM! BLAM! The gun FIRES into the ceiling as they
          wrestle around the room. They BREAK a table and CRASH

          SHATTERING the lamp near Cindy, making her duck for
          cover.
          Cooke slowly FORCES the gun toward Matrix's face. The
          barrel gets CLOSER... CLOSER... then almost points right
          at Matrix.
          With a sudden SURGE of power, Matrix lifts Cooke off
          the ground, pushes him toward the wall and the two of

          the wall.
          BLAM! The gun FIRES, SHATTERING the mirror above the
          young couple and they SCRAMBLE to safety on the floor
          on the other side of the bed.
          Matrix and Cooke come off the wall and SLAM onto the
          floor, the gun coming out of Matrix's hand. Cooke
          picks it up before Matrix can reach it.
          Cooke points the gun right at Matrix's face, pulls back
          the trigger, then smiles.

          Cooke's eyes go cold and still. He's dead. Cindy
          approaches and swallows as she looks down at his body,
          the stake coming out of his chest.

          containing only cash. Matrix tosses it to the floor.
          He brings out a lighter and a package of cigarettes,
          examines the lighter, then tosses both objects to the

          He starts to come out of the car, then suddenly stops.
          He sees the edge of a piece of paper protruding from
          the pocket along the inside of the car door.
          He pulls the paper out and looks at it.

          INSERT - PAPER 146
           It's an invoice from "Coastal Fuel, 110 Hermosa St.,

          50 Redonda St., San Pedro, California, 90733."

          EXT. CADILLAC - NIGHT 147

          Matrix comes out of the car with the invoice and Cindy
          looks at it.

          Coastal is a fuel depot that
          supplies planes.

          No, usually smaller, private
          aircraft.

          INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

          Thirty guerilla soldiers are working in the same
          warehouse that Arius and Bennett had walked through
          earlier. Trucks, tanks, jeeps, bazookas, machine guns,
          mortars, etc. are spread around the darkened room.

                         149

          EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

          Matrix removes a ground level, wire mesh grille from
          the warehouse's outside wall, then he crawls through
          and Cindy replaces the grille.

          INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT 150

          Matrix crawls along the warehouse floor in the darkened
          room. He goes under a jeep, then pauses to survey the
          room.

                         151

          MATRIX'S P.O.V.
          The soldiers move weapons, metal containers and wooden
          crates from the trucks to the jeeps. A soldier's feet
          walk right in front of Matrix, the soldier unloads a
          crate onto the jeep above Matrix, then the feet move
          away.

                         MATRIX
          Matrix crawls away from the jeeps, moves low through
          the shadows, goes into a corridor and sees a door ajar.

                         153

          MATRIX'S P.O.V.
          A soldier, Vega, is looking at some charts on a table.

                         CORRIDOR
          Matrix pushes open the door slightly to see into the
          rest of the room. As the door moves, it CREAKS on
          its hinge.

                         ROOM
          Vega looks up from the charts and sees the door is open
          more then it was. He pauses, then starts walking toward
          the door.

                         156

                         CORRIDOR
          Matrix starts to move away from the door, then stops.
          He hears FOOTSTEPS and CONVERSATION approaching the
          other end of the corridor. He's trapped!

                         ROOM 157
          Vega is two feet away from the inside of the door.

                         CORRIDOR 158
          Matrix desperately grabs the door handle and pushes
          the door forward.

                         ROOM 159
          Matrix SLAMS his fist into Vega's stomach, then quickly
          MOVES into the room, puts a choke hold around Vega
          with his left arm, then carefully closes the door with
          his right.
          As soon as the door closes, the FOOTSTEPS and
          CONVERSATION pass right by the door outside in the
          corridor.
          Matrix pulls Vega toward the back of the room, SMASHES
          his Adam's apple, opens a closet,,drops the dead Vega
          inside, then closes the door.
          He moves to the door leading outside the warehouse,
          opens it and Cindy enters. They begin to whisper.

                         MATRIX
          I saw all the equipment,
          but there's no plane.

                         CINDY
          What about your daughter?
          Matrix shakes his head.

          Arius and Bennett aren't
          here. She's wherever
          they are.
          Matrix looks at Cindy in desperation for a beat, then
          they begin to look around the room.
          The room is designed as the aircraft control room. There
          are aerial charts on the tables and the walls. There are
          photos of several military planes and a civilian
          amphibious plane. There are copies of weather reports
          situated around the room and there is a VHF radio.

                         COORDINATES
          Matrix notes a set of military map coordinates
          penciled onto the side of a chart. They read,
          8734-5245; 8142-5938; 7565-5474. A "Scale line" is
          drawn under the coordinates.

                         161

                         MATRIX
          He studies the coordinates, then picks up a drafting
          compass and pen. He puts three dots, which
          corresponds to the three sets of coordinates onto a
          coasted chart of Southern California.

                         162

                         CINDY
          Cindy is studying the photos of the aircraft.

                         CHART
          Matrix sets the width of the legs of the drafting
          compass, then puts the point of one of the compass legs
          onto one of the three dots and draws a circle.

                         164

          MATRIX AND CINDY
          FOOTSTEPS and CONVERSATION approach the door. Matrix
          stops drawing and freezes. Cindy looks toward the
          door. The FOOTSTEPS reach the door, then continue
          right by it.

                         MATRIX

          amphibian. Maybe they're
          using it to fly there.
          Matrix comes over and looks at the photo of the
          amphibian.

                         CINDY
          Let me see that invoice.
          Matrix takes it out of his pocket, shows it to her
          and she studies it.

          INSERT - INVOICE 168
          She sees, "250 gallons of Type 4 aircraft fuel."

           Matrix and Cindy glance at each other as FOOTSTEPS go
          by outside.
          They continue to whisper.

                         CINDY
          Type four fuel is amphibian
          and two hundred fifty gallons
          is what it would take to
          fly that plane to the island

          with a thick steel grille.
          They pass some street construction equipment
          (steamroller, caterpillar, forklift, flashing warning
          signs, etc.), and drive to the rear of the store.
          There's a heavy concrete wall with no windows.

          Matrix is atop a steamroller that is ROLLING right AT

          and the GLASS SHATTERS INWARD and the steel grille
          BUCKLES AND CRACKS APART under the roller.
          Matrix jumps off the steamroller as the alarm starts to

          Along the first aisle, he grabs a snorkel, mask and
          flippers and tosses them into the cart, then grabs
          a deflated and compressed rubber raft and paddle and
          tosses them in, too.
          He takes the cart and SHOVES it down the aisle, the
          cart coming to a rolling crash among the debris at
          the front of the store. Cindy takes the cart and
          quickly rolls it out of the store.
          Matrix moves to the next aisle, takes another
          shopping cart and moves down the aisle. He grabs
          O.D. fatigue pants, an assault-extraction survival
          vest, a camouflage sweater, black survival boots,
          and combat knives.
          He gives the cart a shove and it rolls crazily down
          the aisle into the debris. Cindy quickly rolls the
          cart outside.
          Matrix moves to the counter and starts feverisl-rly
          moving his hands along the underside looking for
          something.

          water. She reaches down to the back of her knee, feels
          it and grimaces.
          Matrix leans over, moves her hand and looks at what
          caused her to crimace. A nasty looking cut is starting
          to bleed.

                         T':ATRIX
          When'd you get that?
          He reaches into one of his duffel bags and pulls out
          bandages and gauze.

                         CINDY
          The car crash.
          Matrix Wipes her cut and puts the banda:7e dressinc over

                         MATRIX
          That reminds me of what I'm
          buying you as soon as we get
          back.

                         CINDY
          What?
          She expertly wraps the gauze around her leg and ties it.

                         MATRIX
          A new car.

                         CINDY

                         MATRIX
          With a cassette deck...
          She smiles.

 
          Cindy , watching the fireballs and smoke in the
          distance, picks up her radio mike.

          He enters the kitchen, then STOPS COLD. He looks at
          what's facing him.
          Bennett, holding Jenny, has the switchblade PRESSED
          AGAINST her throat.
          Matrix points his handgun right at Bennett.
          Bennett pulls Jenny close against his chest and face,
          shielding himself.

                         BENNETT

                         (MANIACAL)

          GO AHEAD, MATRIX, SHOOT!!
          Matrix hesitates, then lowers his gun. Jenny STRUGGLES
          in Bennett's grip.

          Matrix doesn't move. Bennett grabs Jenny's hair and pulls
          her head back, exposing her throat even more. He PRESSES
          the tip of the sharp stiletto against her Adam's apple.

                         BENNETT

          Matrix RACES through the gates he blew up earlier,
          passes the shell of the blown up transport truck, leaves
          the road and RUNS over grassy knolls and sand dunes.

                         JEEP 350
          Up ahead in the distance, Bennett RACES the jeep toward
          the dock.

          CLOSE ON MATRIX 351
          Matrix's wound is bleeding badly and he begins to
          STRUGGLE to RUN for the first time.

          MATRIX'S P.O.V. 352
          Bennett, now dragging Jenny along, has left the jeep and
          is running along the dock. They stop at Arius' war boat,
          Bennett cuts the moorings with his knife, then he
          FORCES Jenny into the boat.

          Matrix nears the dock as Bennett tries to start the
          engines.
          The engines start to kick over, then stop.
          Matrix RACES onto the foot of the dock.
          Bennett desperately tries the engines again. They start!
          Matrix RACES toward the end of the dock.

                         WAR BOAT 354
          Bennett edges the war boat away from the dock, then
          BLASTS the engines and RACES the boat away...

                         DOCK 355
          .just as Matrix reaches the end of the dock.

          MATRIX'S P.O.V. 356
          Matrix watches the boat RACE away with Jenny.

          CLOSE ON MATRIX 357
          Matrix has lost her. Bennett's got her...

          WIDER FAVORING MATRIX 358

          Cindy is RACING her seaplane toward the dock!

                         DOCK 360
          Cindy slows the seaplane as she passes the dock and
          Matrix grabs onto a ladder.

                         SEAPLANE 361
          with Matrix hanging onto the ladder, Cindy BLASTS the
          throttle and RACES after Bennett's boat.

                         MATRIX 362
          As the seaplane starts to GO FASTER, Matrix holds onto
          the ladder and looks at Bennett's boat up ahead.

                         A85

          MATRIX'S P.O.V. 363
          Bennett's boat is about FORTY YARDS ahead of the
          seaplane.

          INT. SEAPLANE - DAY 364

          Cindy PUSHES the throttle FASTER. She watches as the
          seaplane starts to slowly overtake the boat.

          EXT. SEAPLANE - DAY 365

          The seaplane is SKIMMING and SKIPPING over the water.

                         MATRIX 366
          The wind and spray SLAP against Matrix as he watches
          the seaplane closing the gap on the boat.
          He climbs from the ladder onto the wing of the plane,
          the propellers only about five feet away from him.
          He CRAWLS along the wing of the plane, the wind
          WHIPPING at him.

          INT. SEAPLANE - DAY 367

          Cindy glances out toward Matrix on the wing, then she
          GRIPS the controls FIRMLY to try to lessen the plane's
          bouncing.

          EXT. OCEAN - DAY 368

          The seaplane closes to about FIFTEEN YARDS from the boat.

          EXT. BENNETT'S BOAT - DAY 369

          Bennett looks behind him and sees the seaplane COMING

          AFTER HIM.
          Trying to steer with one hand, Bennett turns toward the
          seaplane as the boat bounces and FIRES WILDLY at Matrix
          on the wing. SLAM? BLAM!

          EXT.'SEAPLANE - DAY 370

          The bullets WHISTLE by Matrix. He continues crawling
          along the wing until he reaches the very end. He pulls
          his gun from his holster and aims it toward the boat.

          MATRIX'S P.O.V. 371
          Matrix tries to aim the gun through the sight, but the
          bouncing of the seaplane, the bouncing of the boat, and
          Jenny's nearness to Bennett makes a shot too risky.

                         A85

          The seaplane starts to PULL EVEN with Bennett's boat.

          EXT. BENNETT'S BOAT - DAY 375

          Bennett looks to the side and sees Cindy in the cockpit
          almost even with him. Starting to panic, he FIRES
          WILDLY as he tries to steer the bouncing boat. BLAM!

          BLAM! BLAM'.

          EXT. SEAPLANE -- DAY 376

          A buttet BLASTS into the seaplane body and a second
          bullet BLASTS into just underneath the cockpit side
          window.

          INT. SEAPLANE - DAY 377

          The third bullet SHATTERS the cockpit window and
          EXPLODES into the cockpit near Cindy's head.
          Cindy doesn't flinch a bit, and edges the seaplane
          ahead of the boat.

          EXT. BOAT -- DAY 378

          Cindy has positioned the seaplane so that the wing
          Matrix is on is directly over the boat. Bennett sees
          the underside of the wing above and FIRES into the
          bottom of it, hoping to hit Matrix. SLAM! SLAM!

          EXT. WING - DAY 379

          Bullet holes RIP through the wing inches from Matrix's
          head.

          Matrix DIVES off the wing right into the boat directly
          on top of Bennett!!
          They CRASH into Jenny and HIT the floor of the boat.

          A shot BLASTS into the fuel tank at the stern of the
          boat.
          WHOOM! There's a small EXPLOSION and the rear of the
          boat erupts in FLAMES.
          Jenny DIVES toward the front of the boat for cover.
          The steering wheel, unattended, shifts WILDLY back and
          forth.

          EXT. OCEAN - DAY 381

          The boat is bouncing CRAZILY toward a deserted rocky
          beach.

          INSERT - SIGN 382
          A large sign on the beach reads "DANGER - U.S. COAST

          GUARD GUNNERY RANGE."

          EXT. OCEAN - DAY 383

          Cindy, in the seaplane, watches as both the seaplane
          and burning boat SPEED RIGHT TOWARD the increasingly
          LOOMING beach up ahead.
          At the last minute, Cindy SWERVES the seaplane to the
          right, away from the beach.

          EXT. BOAT - DAY 384

          The burning boat continues to RACE DIRECTLY AT THE

          RAPIDLY APPROACHING ROCKY BEACH!
          Matrix SAVAGELY TWISTS Bennett's wrist hand that holds
          the gun.

                         BENNETT

          AAAHHH ! 1
          He drops the gun on the floor of the boat.
          The boat is JUST ABOUT TO HIT THE BEACH!
          Matrix SMASHES Bennett's face with his fist, KNOCKING

          EXT. U.S. COAST GUARD PATROL SHIP - DAY 386

          A CAPTAIN on the bridge of a Coast Guard patrol ship
          looks toward the ship's large guns.

                         CAPTAIN
          Commence target practice...
          The guns begin to fire their salvos.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. BEACH - DAY 387

          Matrix groggily gathers himself on the sand. He hears
          the SOUNDS of incoming rounds and BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
          BOOM! Artillery shells EXPLODE on the beach.

          EXT. BOAT - DAY 388

          Bennett grabs Jenny and hustles her out of the boat,
          hiding behind the front outside hull of the boat.

          EXT. BEACH - DAY 389

          Matrix runs to the opposite side of the boat, and
          crouches down on the sand, then draws his automatic
          handgun from its holster.
          BOOM! BOOM! Some more artillery shells EXPLODE, kicking
          up sand not too far away.
          Bennett, his knife against Jenny, is on one side of the
          boat. Matrix, holding his gun, is on the other side of
          the boat.

          This doesn't involve her,
          Bennett. It's just between
          you...and me.
          An artillery shell EXPLODES near Bennett and Jenny.

          CLOSEUP - BENNETT 390
          A CLOSEUP of Bennett shows him REACTING disorientedly
          to the SOUND, SMOKE AND FLASH of the explosion.

          ABRUPT CUT TO:

                         QUICK FLASHBACK 391
          Bennett and Matrix have their faces pressed to the
          dirt as a mortar shell EXPLODES near their heads.
          Bennett gets up, wildly looks around, then maniacally
          FIRES his submachine gun, KILLING three young children
          running scared across a Val Verde field.
          Matrix rises and SMASHES his rifle butt into Bennett's
          face.

          CUT BACK TO:

          EXT. BEACH - DAY 392

          Bennett's crazed mind returns to the present.

          Let her go, Bennett and I'll
          give you a chance to twist
          that knife into me.
          The stern of the boat continues to burn as Bennett
          considers what Matrix said.

                         MATRIX
          Just what I thought, Bennett,
          you're still a yellow
          chicken-shit.
          Bennett's eyes fill with hate. More shells EXPLODE
          nearby.

                         BENNETT

          Matrix tosses the gun away down the beach. Bennett
          violently pushes Jenny into the wet sand along the
          edge of the water.

                         MATRIX 393
          Matrix takes his knife out of his wrist sheath and
          meets Bennett on the sand in front of the boat.

          MATRIX AND BENNETT 394
          Matrix and Bennett begin to circle each other.

                         BENNETT
          You're dead...
          He feints the knife toward Matrix.

                         BENNETT
          .and so is she.

                         JENNY 395
          Jenny watches the fight in horror.

          MATRIX AND BENNETT 396
          Bennett jabs with his knife and SLASHES Matrix, causing
          a bloody cut.
          Bennett jabs again. This time Matrix parries the
          jab, and SLASHES Bennett, causing a bloody cut on him.
          They circle each other again, FEINTING jabs at each
          other.
          BOOM! BOOM! Two more shells EXPLODE and kick up sand
          nearby.

          A lieutenant pilots a copter as General Kirby, sitting
          next to him, speaks into a radio mike. They are flying
          along the coast of the island, another Army helicopter
          behind them. They HEAR the SOUNDS of the explosions.

                         KIRBY

          EXT. BEACH - DAY 398

          Bennets STABS at Matrix and Matrix grabs his wrist.
          With his free hand, Matrix STABS at Bennett and Bennett
          grabs Matrix's wrist.
          They are locked hand in hand, staring death into each
          other's eyes.

                         JENNY 399
          Jenny, watching the fight, notices Matrix's gun on the
          beach near her and hesitates to pick it up.

          MATRIX AND BENNETT 400
          Suddenly Matrix falls backward to the ground, pulling
          Bennett with him and FLIPS Bennett over him HARD to
          the sand.
          Matrix jumps up quickly to finish Bennett. Bennett
          quickly THROWS SAND in matrix's eyes.
          Matrix, blinded, stumbles badly.
          Bennett immediately grabs Matrix's knife hand around
          the wrist, then SINKS his own knife into Matrix's
          side.

                         MATRIX

          AAAHHH!
          Matrix's eyes go glassy, then he drops his knife.
          Bennett lets Matrix's wrist go, looks at Matrix's
          glassy eyes for a beat, then he pulls his knife out of
          Matrix's side.
          Matrix STAGGERS for a beat, then STUMBLES a few steps
          and drops to one knee against the front outside hull of
          the boat.
          Bennett slowly approaches Matrix from behind, casually
          feeling the blade of his knife.
          He looks at Matrix's wide, unprotected back and Bennett
          smiles.
          Bennett pulls the knife back with his arm, preparing to
          plunge it into Matrix's back.

          CLOSE ON MATRIX 401
          Out of Bennett's sight, Matrix slips the knife out of
          his boot and GRIPS the knife.

          Fuck you, asshole...
          He PLUNGES the knife down toward Matrix's back.
          Matrix moves LIKE LIGHTNING to the side. The knife
          misses him and GETS STUCK in the hull of the boat.
          Matrix turns toward Bennett.

                         MATRIX
          (shaking his head)
          No...
          Bennett tries desperately to get his knife unstuck from
          the boat hull, but he can't. Fear FLOODS his eyes.
          Matrix moves close to Bennett.

                         MATRIX
          Fuck YOU, asshole...
          He DRIVES his knife into Bennett's throat so hard the
          knife goes through Bennett's neck and comes out the
          other side.
          Still holding the knife, Matrix then DRIVES the knife
          into the hull of the boat.
          The knife STICKS into the hull, holding Bennett's neck
          there like a thumbtack holds a note on a bulletin board.
          BOOM? Suddenly there is another, larger EXPLOSION in
          the fiery back of the boat and the whole boat EXPLODES
          into FLAMES, leaving Bennett lost in the fireball.

          MATRIX AND JENNY 403
          Matrix limps away from the flames, Jenny rushes into
          his arms and he holds her close. She's crying.
          She shows him she was holding his gun.

                         JENNY
          I wanted to shoot...but I
          couldn't, I just couldn't.

          He takes the gun from her and tosses it past the burning
          boat into the ocean.

          He sees two Army helicopters approaching from the air
          and Cindy bringing her seaplane to the beach.

          EXT. BEACH 405

          Matrix lies down, his head in Jenny's lap, and tries
          to still his bleeding.
          The two copters land. Kirby gets out of one and two
          medical corpsmen with a stretcher get out of the other.
          The corpsmen bring the stretcher to Matrix and gently
          ease him onto it. They start to carry him as Jenny
          walks alongside.

                         KIRBY
          I just saw what's left of Arius'
          estate... You're the best I've

          place for you if you want to
          join up with me again.
          Matrix notices as Cindy joins Jenny standing next to
          him. Matrix looks at the two of them, then up at
          Kirby.

                         MATRIX
          This was the last one...
          The corpsmen carry Matrix into the copter and Jenny
          joins him inside.
          Kirby and Cindy watch him from outside the chopper.

          Two might not be enough...
          The chopper wings have started and the chopper is
          preparing to liftoff.
          Matrix and Cindy are looking at each other.
          The chopper starts to liftoff.
          Cindy suddenly RUNS to the chopper and JUMPS in the door
          as it lifts off.
          Matrix puts his arm around her, then he looks back
          toward Kirby.
          Matrix holds up three fingers and smiles.

          Kirby waves good-bye as the chopper rises high above
          the beach and flies out over the ocean.
