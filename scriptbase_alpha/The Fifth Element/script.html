<b>FADE IN:
</b>
<b>1	EXT.  DESERT  NILE RIVER  VALLEY - DAY
</b>
	Somewhere in the Nile at the edge of the desert.

<b>	CREDITS  ROLL
</b>
<b>	WRITTEN:	EGYPT 1913
</b>
	OMAR and his mule zigzag along the bottom of sun scorched dunes.

<b>2	EXT.  TEMPLE  EXCAVATION - DAY
</b>
	The mule and the boy finally reach a camp.  A few tents dwarfed by a huge
temple door jutting out of the sand.  The camp is deserted except for
some kids by the temple entrance holding large mirrors, reflecting light
into the temple.
	Omar leaves his mule in the shade, seizes two goatskins and slips inside
the temple.

<b>3	INT.  TEMPLE - DAY
</b>
	Omar makes his way uneasily down a pillared corridor that opens into a
vast room where an old scientist stands on a small wooden ladder in front of
the wall across the room.  PROFESSOR MASSIMO PACOLI. A young man is beside
him, BILLY MASTERSON, age 25, an American student. He has a large sketchpad in
his hands.  Behind them AZIZ, age 10, whose job is to hold the last
mirror which shines light into the expansive room.

<b>						PROFESSOR
</b>					(deciphering)
				"..when the three planets are in eclipse.."

	His fingers trace across the wall which is covered with symbols and
strange hieroglyphs as he deciphers.

<b>						PROFESSOR
</b>				"..the black hole like a door is open...
				Evil comes ... sowing terror and chaos..."
				See?  The snake, Billy.  The Ultimate Evil
				... make sure you get the snake!

	The Professor points emphatically to the snake, the symbol of Evil,
coming through the door between the three planets in eclipse.  C.U.
Billy's hand sketches the snake quickly.  He is a natural artist.

<b>						BILLY
</b>				And when is this door opening snake act
				supposed to occur?

	The Professor's fingers touch the signs.

<b>						PROFESSOR
</b>				..if this is the five..and this the thousand..

	He calculates.

<b>						PROFESSOR
</b>				Every five thousand years..

<b>						BILLY
</b>					(kidding)
				So I have some time..

	He reaches for the pad.

	ANGLE ON:  Omar.  Standing at the entrance to the chamber with the water
bag, entranced by the sight.  A skeletal hand falls on his shoulder.  Omar
turns to an ancient PRIEST in a rough milled black cannock.

<b>						PRIEST
</b>				I will take it to them my son.

	Startled but obedient, Omar gives the water bag to the Priest.

<b>						PRIEST
</b>				Go with God.. be safe from Evil..

	The Priest makes the sign of the Cross on the boy's forehead, dismissing
him.
	As soon as he is gone, the Priest turns a worried eye to the Professor.

	ANGLE ON:  The Professor is back to translating, Billy to sketching.

<b>						PROFESSOR
</b>				"..then arrange the elements of life against
				the Terror just so.."

	His fingers run on.

<b>						PROFESSOR
</b>				"..Water..fire..earth..air..four
				elements around the fifth.."

	His fingers fall on the one element that has a human shape, surrounded by
all the others.

	The Priest opens the water skin and begins to pour a vial of powder into
the skin.

	ANGLE ON:  Aziz falling asleep.  The mirror falls, the light fails.

<b>						PROFESSOR
</b>				Aziz!  Light!

	The boy struggles to stay awake.  The mirror comes up.

<b>						PRIEST
</b>				Lord forgive me.. they already know too,
				much..

<b>						PROFESSOR
</b>				"..in which all the history of the Universe resides
				..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from
Evil.."

<b>						PRIEST (V.O.)
</b>				Amen..

	The Professor turns to the Priest who is pouring water into a tin cup
from the skin.

<b>						PROFESSOR
</b>				Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing..
				the greatest find in history..can you imagine
				the implications.

<b>						PRIEST
</b>				Only too well... here you must be
				parched..

	He hands the cup to the Professor.  The Professor takes it, has it almost
to his lips when..

<b>						PROFESSOR
</b>				I mean look.. it is like a battle plan..

	In his excitement he does not drink, much to the Priest's chagrin.

<b>						PROFESSOR
</b>				Here the Good.. Here the Evil..

	As the Priest looks up, Aziz the mirror  boy, tips his mouth under the
water skin, drinking the leakage.

<b>						PROFESSOR
</b>				Here..

	He points to the Five Elements.

<b>						PROFESSOR
</b>				A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am
				going to be famous.

<b>						PRIEST
</b>				Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..

	The Priest hands Billy a cup.

<b>						PRIEST
</b>				Drink!

<b>						PROFESSOR
</b>				To fame.. salud..

	The Professor raises the cup to drink, and then...

<b>						PROFESSOR
</b>				We cannot toast with water.. Billy !
				In my sack.. the Grappa!

	The Priest watches, disconsolate, as the Professor tosses away his water.
Billy finishes his cup before running off into the tunnel.

<b>4	EXT.  COLONNADE - DAY
</b>
	A muffled SOUND grows steadily louder. Outside, a monstrous linear shadow
disturbs the kid's game and gradually darkens the temple entrance.

<b>5	INT.  TUNNEL - DAY
</b>
	Billy is looking for the grappa in the Professor's bag.  He comes upon a
machine pistol.  When the muffled SOUND suddenly grabs his attention.  He
leans toward the corridor and sees part of a spaceship appear.  Billy is
paralyzed.

<b>6	INT.  TEMPLE  ROOM - DAY
</b>
	The Professor keeps reading over the inscription.

<b>						PROFESSOR
</b>				"..this perfect person.. this perfect
				being.." I do not understand this.. perfect?

<b>						PROFESSOR
</b>				Where is that boy? Billy!

<b>7	INT.  TUNNEL - DAY
</b>
	Billy presses himself against the wall, in the shadows, terrified, but
sketching away like mad, as large shadowed figures lumber past him.  He
begins to blink, feeling the effects of the Priest's potion..

<b>8	INT.  TEMPLE  ROOM - DAY
</b>
	The Professor reads the wall.

<b>						PROFESSOR
</b>				And this divine Light they talk
				about.. what is Divine light?

	At that moment, the reflection from Aziz's mirror drops again.  The light
fails.

<b>						PROFESSOR
</b>					(without turning)
				Aziz light!

	The room is flooded with light all of the sudden.

<b>						PROFESSOR
</b>				Better.. this is the most unbelievable thing
				I have ever seen..

	The Professor turns around, and is stunned speechless to find himself
face to face with two MONDOSHAWANS.  A dozen others fill the hall manning
the source of the light, large luminous globes.  Aziz is fast asleep.

<b>						PROFESSOR
</b>					(uncomprehending)
				...Uh, yes?

	The Professor is lifted up and carried off to the side by the aliens.
The KOMMANDER stops in front of the Priest who is still on his knees, face
to the ground.

<b>						PRIEST
</b>				Master... He was about to discover everything,
				but I had the situation under control.

	The two MONDOSHAWAN GUARDS hold the professor three feet off the ground.

<b>						PROFESSOR
</b>					(in a panic)
				Who are you?  Are you Germans?  Sprechen
				Sie Deutsch?

<b>9	INT.  TUNNEL
</b>
	Billy staggers forward, a machine pistol in his hand.

<b>10	INT.  TEMPLE  ROOM
</b>
	The KOMMANDER holds out his hand to the Priest.

<b>						PRIEST
</b>				What did I do wrong?

	The Priest jumps to his feet excitedly.

<b>						KOMMANDER
</b>				Servant, you and the thousand guards
				before you... You have done your work well,
				but we have to recover the elements. War will
				soon engulf your planet. We must keep them safe.

	The Kommander goes over to the wall and seems to be looking for a lock.
He finds it and slides in his metallic finger which is more intricate
than a key to a safe.  He turns his hand, activating a mechanism that opens
the wall.

<b>						PROFESSOR
</b>				Unbelievable!!!

	The Kommander turns around and crooks a finger.  One of the MONDOSHAWANS
	waves his hand, puts the professor to sleep and heads down the hallway
revealed by the opening.  He is followed by his men.  The Priest slips in
behind them.

<b>11	INT.  ROOM 2  TEMPLE - DAY
</b>
	The Kommander steps into a vast room.  The ceiling is very high, pyramid-
shaped.  In each corner of the room, four vessels contain four
rectangular twelve-inch stones-, the four elements.  In the middle, an
opaque sarcophagus rests on an altar.  The Kommander stops and
contemplates it a moment.

<b>						PRIEST
</b>					(to himself)
				The Fifth Element...

<b>						KOMMANDER
</b>				Take them and put them in a safe place.

	His men carry out his order.

<b>12	INT.  ROOM 1  TEMPLE - DAY
</b>
	Billy staggers across the floor, struggling to stay awake.

<b>13	INT.  ROOM 2  TEMPLE - DAY
</b>
	The Kommander opens a case.  His men come and put the four, precious
stones in it, one by one.

<b>						PRIEST
</b>					(moved)
				Will the elements be gone now forever
				from this place?

<b>						KOMMANDER
</b>				When mankind comes to its senses.
				We will return.

<b>						PRIEST
</b>				Knowing mankind as I do, that could take
			centuries!

<b>						KOMMANDER
</b>				Time is of no importance, only life
				is important.

	The Priest nods and lowers his eyes.

	Angle on:  Billy staggering forward, raising his pistol, blinking his
eyes to focus..

	A MONDOSHAWAN puts the fourth element in the case The Kommander shuts the
	case and looks at the Priest.

<b>						KOMMANDER
</b>				When EVIL returns so shall we.

<b>						PRIEST
</b>					(head lowered)
				We will be ready, Lord.

	Billy suddenly staggers into the room, brandishing his gun.

<b>						BILLY
</b>				Stop.

	Billy trips, the gun goes off.  He empties the clip.  The Mondoshawan
carrying the case crumples to the ground.  The wall immediately begins to
close.  Billy fires wildly, unable to control the powerful kicking gun.

<b>						PRIEST
</b>				No!!!  Don't!!!

	The Priest rushes Billy.  The weapon has such a kick to it that Billy
starts shooting into the air, backs up, then stumbles and knocks himself
out.  The Priest is on the ground, seriously wounded.  So is the Kommander.
The WARRIORS are in a panic.

<b>						CLERK
</b>				Hurry, Kommander!  The wall's closing!!!

	The wall continues to close.  Sand pours in from everywhere.  The vast
room fills up like an hourglass.

<b>						KOMMANDER
</b>				A mission is a mission, Savoia.
				You'll learn that.

	The Kommander picks up the case and reaches the wall but can't get
through it.  His
	armor is too bulky, the opening too small.  He manages to get his arm and
the case through.

<b>						KOMMANDER
</b>				My apologies to General Kroi -- and my wife..

	The wall closes, crushing his arm.  The CLERK scoops up the case and runs
	through the huge piles of sand.

<b>14	EXT.  COLONNADE - DAY
</b>
	The CLERK boards the ship carrying the case.  Omar hides in a corner,
frightened to death, hugging Billy's bag of drawings.

<b>15	INT.  TEMPLE  ROOM - DAY
</b>
	The room fills with sand.  The Priest's body is soon buried.

<b>16	EXT.  DESERT - DAY
</b>
	The huge ship's main hatch closes.

<b>17	EXT.  TEMPLE - DAY
</b>
	The ship lifts off and speeds away. Omar emerges from the temple gaping
at the ship as it vanishes in the sky.

<b>18	EXT.  PYRAMIDS
</b>
	A gigantic shooting star flashes above the pyramids.

<b>19	EXT.  EARTH  ORBIT
</b>
	The ship passes in front of us and heads for the stars disappearing at
unbelievable speed.  The background is a star-spattered cosmos.

<b>	WRITTEN:	500 YEARS LATER
</b>
	Another, more modern, spaceship, fills the screen.  A warship belonging
to the Federal Army.

<b>20	INT.  SPACESHIP  CONTROL  ROOM
</b>
	CU of a digital control screen.  Three planets projecting three straight
lines that crisscross at one point.  Identical to the one observed by the
professor on the temple wall.  GENERAL STAEDERT looks out through the
ship's window at one of the three huge planets in eclipse.

<b>						STAEDERT
</b>				Don't you have anything?  Not even
				a temperature?

<b>						CAPTAIN
</b>				The thermo-analyzers have jammed.
				One of them reads over a million degrees,
				the other's at minus 5000...
				Never seen anything like it.

<b>						TECHNICIAN
</b>				It's taking shape.

<b>21	EXT.  SPACE
</b>
	In the middle of the shadows, a door to the nightmare has just opened.
Evil is back.  A round, moving mass, continually changing color.

<b>						CAPTAIN
</b>					(in awe)
				What the hell can it be?

<b>						TECHNICIAN
</b>				Hook-up with the president in one
				minute, General.

	General Staedert remains calm.

<b>						STAEDERT
</b>				...Send out a probe.

<b>22	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE  MANHATTAN
</b>
	LINDBERG, 50, the president of the United Federations, his features lined
and worn by various delegations, mainly military, enters his office.
There's a crisis in the air.  The President's AIDE leans down to his ear.

<b>						AIDE
</b>				On air in 30 seconds.

	In the middle of the group is a Priest whose appearance reminds us of
Egypt.  A younger man DAVID, 18, shy, a priest-in-training attends the old
man.

<b>23	INT.  CONTROL  ROOM / PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE
</b>
<b>						CAPTAIN
</b>				President on line sir..

	General Staedert leans over his screen and seems surprised to see the
room but not the president.

<b>						PRESIDENT (O.S.)
</b>				Staedert, do you read me?

<b>						STAEDERT
</b>				I can hear you, Mr. President, but I
				can't see you .

	The President grabs the mini-camera on his desk and yanks it around to
face him.
	His face fills the screen.

<b>						PRESIDENT
</b>					(exasperated)
				Is that better?

<b>						STAEDERT
</b>				Perfect, Mr. President.

<b>						PRESIDENT
</b>				I have to address the Supreme Council
				in 10 minutes.
				Just the facts, General.

<b>						STAEDERT
</b>				There are no results from the chemical
				and molecular analysis as of yet, all the
				calibers are overshot..we're hoping a
				thermo nucleatic imaging..

<b>						PRESIDENT
</b>				(exasperated)
				What you are saying is you don't know
				what this..thing..is.

	Consternation reigns in the President's office.

<b>						STAEDERT
</b>				Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is
				it just keeps getting bigger!

<b>						PRESIDENT
</b>				Options.

<b>						STAEDERT
</b>				Wait or act.

<b>						PRESIDENT
</b>				Recommendations.

<b>						STAEDERT
</b>				My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first
				ask questions later.
				I don't like uninvited guests.

<b>						PRESIDENT
</b>				Gentlemen?

<b>						HEAD CHEMISTS
</b>				I think it would be foolish to shoot at an
				organism that seems alive, without first
				taking the time to study it more!
				Besides, it has shown no signs of hostility.

<b>						PRESIDENT
</b>					(worried)
				No... it's just getting bigger.

<b>						HEAD CHEMISTS
</b>				So do people, but that's no reason to shoot
				them.

<b>						PRESIDENT
</b>					(exasperated)

	All the Generals nod "yes"

<b>						PRESIDENT
</b>				All right, then! Staedert?

<b>						PRIEST (O.S.)
</b>				Mr. President?

	The President scans the room. Staedert remote controls the camera toward
the room.

<b>						PRESIDENT
</b>				...Yes?

	The camera moves up the Priest and we finally discover his face.  He is
in his sixties, a shrewd look in his eyes.
	Around his neck hangs the Kommander's finger, the key to the temple.

<b>						PRIEST
</b>				Cornelius, Vito Cornelius. 50th level parish.
				I have a different theory to offer you,
				Mr. President.

<b>						PRESIDENT
</b>				I'm listening.

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not
				anything that can be identified because it prefers
				not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are.
				Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.

<b>						PRESIDENT
</b>					(a little sarcastically)
				One more reason to shoot first eh?

	All the Generals nod in agreement.

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				Evil begets evil, Mr. President.
				Shooting would only make it stronger.

	A series of three missiles heads for the planet, which absorbs them all.

	A bead of sweat pearls Staedert's forehead. He is about to give an order
when a gigantic flame emerges from the planet and literally swallows
Staedert's spaceship.

his head.  Thirty five years old, short hair, powerfully built,

The alarm clock is still ringing, it shows the date as March 18, 2359.  It
in two in the morning. Ha grabs a cigarette, and stops to look for a

	still rings.  Korben takes a moment and then realizes it in the phone
that is ringing.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>					(to the cat)
				I'm coming.

	He grabs the phone and crosses his tiny apartment (27 feet long by 6 feet

bed makes itself automatically.

<b>						KORBEN

				Yeah?

<b>						FINGER (V.O.)

	Korben finds a box of matches with three matches.  He strikes one. It
does not light.  Korben opens the fridge, bare, except for an empty can of
GEMINI croquettes.
	On the packet is an ad:

<b>						KORBEN
</b>					(lying)
				Uh... at least fifty.

<b>						FINGER (V.O.)
</b>				In your dreams! See you tonight!

	Finger has hang up.  Korben sighs and does the same.  He gets the heated
brackish water and sits down.  The cat pounces on the table and meows for
its food.  Korben pours half the coffee in the cat's cup.

	The cat meows.  Korben taps his cup to the cat's saucer.

				The Mondoshawans don't belong to the

				These elements when they are gathered around a fifth:
				The Supreme Being, ultimate warrior, created to protect

	The SUPREME BEING is standing, as if frozen in armor.  All we see is the
bottom half of his body.  Big metallic gloves hold the case engraved with
the emblem of the three suns containing the four Sacred Stones.

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				..will produce what the ancients called the
				light of creation, the light of total goodness
				which is the only thing that can defeat EVIL.

	The President points to the spot occupied by the 5th element.

<b>						PRESIDENT
</b>				But what happens if instead of
				this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL
				who stands here?

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				White turns to black.  Light to Dark.
				Life to Death.  For all eternity.

	The President's nerves quiver.

<b>						CAPTAIN

	Korben is about to exit the apartment.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Don't watch it all day, it'll rot your

	In response, the cat meows.  Korben opens the door to..A huge

<b>						MUGGER
</b>				The cash man!

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Been here long?

<b>						MUGGER
</b>				Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow

				Neuro charged assault model?

<b>						MUGGER
</b>					(off balance)
				Uh..

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				You know you could hurt someone with
				this puppy..good thing it's not loaded..

	The mugger is lost.  He looks at his weapon.

<b>						MUGGER
</b>				It's not?

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				You gotta push the little yellow button...

	Korben points to the button on the side of the gun.  The mugger takes his
advice.

<b>						MUGGER
</b>				Thanks..

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				You're welcome..

	And with lightning speed, Korben blasts the mugger with a straight right
hand, sending him down for the count.  Korben retrieves the gun.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				..you know these things are VERY illegal..
				you could get in a shit load of trouble..
				I better hang onto it for you..

	As the mugger clears his head, Korben opens a drawer next to him which is
full of similar guns! The mugger's eyes pop out of his head.  He scampers
to his feet and runs off.

	Korben shrugs, exits his apartment, and closes the door.  The cat watches
a nuclear holocaust on T.V.,  uninterrupted.

	PROFESSOR MACTILBURGH, age 60, hurries alongside GENERAL MUNRO.

<b>						MUNRO
</b>				This is all that survived?

<b>						MACTILBURGH
</b>				Actually only one cell survived..

<b>						MUNRO
</b>				Have you identified it?

<b>						MACTILBURGH
</b>				It's not that easy..we've never encountered
				anything like it before..you see normal human
				beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is
				more than enough for any species to perpetuate
				itself..This one has 200,000.

<b>						MUNRO
</b>				Talk English Doc.

<b>						MACTILBURGH
</b>				This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite
				genetic knowledge stored inside.
				Almost like it was...engineered.

<b>						MUNRO
</b>				Sounds like a freak of nature to me.

<b>						MACTILBURGH
</b>				Yes... I can't wait to meet him.

	They pass into the lab.

<b>53	INT.  LABORATORY

	The two enter a cylindrical laboratory.  There is a huge glass turbine in
the middle with the metal glove inside.  A DNA chain scrolls on the computer
screen.

<b>						MACTILBURGH
</b>					(rather fascinated)
				The compositional elements of his DNA
				chain are the same as ours, there are simply
				more of them tightly packed.
				His knowledge is probably limitless..

<b>						MUNRO
</b>					(worried)
				Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?

<b>						MACTILBURGH
</b>				We put it through the cellular hygiene detector.
				The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.

	Munro hesitates a moment.  Then he sighs and uses his personal key to
open the
	self-destruct box.

<b>						MUNRO
</b>				OK, go ahead! But Mr. Perfect better be polite...
				otherwise I turn him into cat food.

	Mactilburgh starts the operation rolling as Munro puts his hand on the
sell-destruct button, ready to use it.  Thousands of cells form in the
heart of the generator, an assemblage of DNA elements.  Then the cells move
down a tube, like a fluid, and gather in an imprint of a HUMAN body.  Step
by step bones are reconstructed, then the nervous and muscular systems.
Whole veins wrap around the muscles.  An entire body is reconstructing before
our very eyes.

<b>						DOCTOR
</b>				Three seconds to ultra-violet protection.

	A shield comes over the reconstructing body and makes it invisible.

<b>						MACTILBURGH
</b>					(to Munro)
				...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction
				of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly
				greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells
				to react, to protect themselves.
				That means growing skin. Clever, eh?

<b>						MUNRO
</b>					(disgusted)
				Wonderful!

	The meter slows, drops to zero.

<b>						ASSISTANT
</b>				... End of reconstruction, beginning of
				reanimation .

	A whoosh of air in the glass chamber.  Captain Munro has his hand on the
self-destruct button, ready to destroy the being that has barely been
reborn.

<b>						MACTILBURGH
</b>					(pushing a button)
				Activate life support system.

	An electrical discharge fills the glass chamber causing the body inside
to jerk.
	After a few moments of silence, the SOUND of a heartbeat fills the room
over the loudspeaker.

<b>						ASSISTANT
</b>				Life support system activated.

	The Supreme Being is alive once again.

<b>						MACTILBURGH
</b>				Remove the shield.

	The ASSISTANT automatically removes the ultra-violet shield which slowly
reveals... a woman... nude... young... and very beautiful.  Munro stands there
gaping.  Not quite his vision of the Supreme Being.  Mactilburgh glances
at Munro and gently pushes his hand away from the self-destruct button.

<b>						MACTILBURGH
</b>					(with a smile)
				I told you ... perfect!

	Munro is hypnotized by the GIRL's beauty.

<b>						MUNRO
</b>				...I'd, uh , like to get a few pictures for the
archives
				before she wakes up.

	Mactilburgh looks at him with a grin.  A remote-control camera approaches
the girl's face, a flash goes off.  Blinded by the flash, the girl jumps and
screams.  She cowers in a corner, shaking from the cold, darting eyes
everywhere looking for the case she was holding.

<b>						GIRL

				What's she saying?

<b>						MACTILBURGH
</b>					(to his ASSISTANT)
				Activate the phonic detector.

	The girl kicks the window repeatedly.

<b>						MACTILBURGH
</b>				And give her a light sedative...
				and something to wear!

	The ASSISTANT hits a button.  A pile of clothes drops out of a trapdoor
in the ceiling.  She snatches up the clothes angrily and dresses quickly.
Munro draws closer to the glass window.  He watches her dress with
undisguised pleasure.

<b>						MUNRO
</b>					(to Mactilburgh)
				This thing solid?

<b>						MACTILBURGH
</b>					(smiling)
				An elephant couldn't crack it.

	The Girl finishes dressing.

<b>						GIRL
</b>					(angrily)
				Teno akta chataman assin-omekta!

	Munro smiles safely behind his plate glass window.

<b>						MUNRO
</b>					(with a smile)
				You're gonna have to learn to communicate
				better than that angel if you want out.

	Munro dangles the key on a chain that will let her out.  The girl rams
her fist right through the window.  She grabs the key and yanks it.  The
chain snaps tight and Munro slams into the window knocking himself out.  The
girl puts her hand through the window again, unlocks the chamber and steps
out.  She is still bit wobbly on her legs.  Two GUARDS try to grab her.
She sends them flying across the room. Mactilburgh is most impressed.  He
sets off a general alarm.

<b>54	INT.  CORRIDOR  LABORATORY

	The girl runs through a maze of corridors looking for a way out.  A squad
of SECURITY GUARDS appear in front of her and open fire without warning. The
girl takes a leap, grabs an air vent, kicks it out and dives into the air
shaft.  The COPS try and jump up to the vent, but none can reach it.

	She has exited to a ledge on the 450th floor of a building, right in the

vertically...The girl edges along the narrow ledge, unfazed by the height.
The CHIEF leans out the vent, looking out into the void.

<b>						CHIEF
</b>					(to his men)
				Go on follow her!

	The COPS stare into the gaping void.

<b>						COP
</b>				...No way.

	The CHIEF angrily pulls out his gun and shoots at the girl who ducks
around the corner of the building.  Unfortunately the other side in full of
cops as well.  A flying police car zooms up in front of her, sirens
blaring.

<b>						VOICE (O.S.)
</b>				This in the police.  Your status is illegal.

off.

<b>						VOICE / KORBEN
</b>				You have one point left on your license.
				Have a good day.

	Korben sighs and looks in the back seat to see what the damages are.  The
girl, a bit dazed (who wouldn't be), emerges from the debris and sits up.
There's some blood on her face.  Korben is stunned. The girl's still alive
and... so beautiful.  His heart heads for a meltdown.

<b>						GIRL
</b>				Akina delutan, nou-shan.

	A police car with wailing sirens halts in front of Korben.

				Please leave your hands on the wheel.
				Thank you for your cooperation.

<b>						KORBEN

				Sorry, Hon, but I only got one point left
				on my license and I gotta get to the garage!

	The police car presses up against the cab.  Doors slide open.  Huge guns
point at her.  Korben feels lousy.  The girl's helpless, there are tears in
her eyes, she looks exhausted.
	Korben glances at her in the rear view mirror. She's looking all around
to find something to help her communicate with him.

	Her POV: an ad on the back of the seat. An 800 number to help an
orphanage. A teary photo of a kid over the words Please Help.  She shoots
to Korben a look of pure distress.

<b>						GIRL
</b>					(irresistible)
				Please... HELP...

	Korben can't resist her plea.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Don't put me in this position...
				I can't... I'm late as it is...

	But he cannot say no to her eyes.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Finger's gonna kill me.

	Korben shuts oft the meter and floors it, sideswiping the police car as
he roars away.

<b>						VOICE (O.S.)
</b>				Your license has been revoked.
				Would you please....

	Korben whips out a gun and shatters the loudspeaker.

<b>						KORBEN

	The police car takes out after him, sirens screeching.  An insane chase
ensues.

				it's how to drive.

	Korben turns his cab sideways and scrapes through a narrow passageway,
	ripping his taxi light from the roof.  The police car smashes into the
wall.  The other one brakes just in time.

<b>						COP
</b>				Shit! Attention all-patrol cars!

	The car makes a U-turn, looking for a wider passageway.

<b>60	EXT.  NEW YORK  STREET
</b>
	The police car roars up, sirens screaming then slows down and checks out
a dead-end flanked by a large vertical neon billboard. The dead-end is empty .
Korben's cab is hidden vertically behind the billboard.  Seeing nothing, the
	police drive away.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				We'll wait till things quiet down a bit.
				You mind?

	The girl grabs his shirt collar and pulls him close, whispers in his ear.

<b>						GIRL
</b>					(weak)
				...Priest...

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				You're not that bad... Come on we'll
				get you to a doctor.

	The girl hands him the handle of the case, struck with the three Egyptian
suns.

<b>						GIRL
</b>					(weak)
				Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Vito Cornelius?

	The girl nods, then faints.  Korben is somewhat lost faced with so much
mystery.

<b>61	INT.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
	The door opens. Korben is there with the unconscious girl in his arms.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>					(embarrassed)
				Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>					(tired)
				Weddings are one floor down.
				Congratulations.

	Cornelius closes the door.  The doorbell RINGS again.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				She's not my bride, she's my fare.
				She's looking for this Vito Cornelius.
				According to the phone guide he lives here.

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>					(curious)
				That's me.  But I don't know who she is...
				where did you find her?

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				She dropped in on me... holding this.

	Korben hands him the metal handle with the three Egyptian suns, stamped
on it.

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>					(staggered)
				The fifth element.

	He faints dead away.  Korben, with the girl still in his arms looks
around helpless.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>					(sighing)
				Finger's gonna kill me...

<b>62	INT.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
	In his armchair, Cornelius gets woken by a slap in the face.

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>					(with a start)
				Who are you?

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				I brought the girl remember?

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				The girl?

	Cornalius gets up.  He looks at the handle.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Yeah! She dropped in on me. I mean
				on my taxi... talking... this... this bizarre
				language...

	And then it dawns on Cornelius who the girl is.

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>					(eyes riveted on her)
				He's a she!

<b>						KORBEN
</b>					(bemused)
				You noticed...

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>					(face shining)
				There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up,
				but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's
				most precious possession! She is... perfect!

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				So you do know her.

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..

	Cornelius runs into the next room.  Korben looks at the girl, goes to
slap her, then changes his mind.

	Her beauty troubles him.  He hesitates, then, gently caresses her cheek.
Her skin seems so soft, so fragile.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Perfect...

<b>63	INT.  SMALL  ROOM
</b>
	David, is mending a cassock when Cornelius bursts into the room out of
breath.

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				It's a miracle!!!

<b>						DAVID
</b>					(worried)
				What is?

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>					(babbling crazily)
				I can't wear these clothes! This calls
				for dignity!
				I have to dress the part!

	He opens a closet filled with identical robes and plunges in,
disappearing as David looks on, uncomprehending.

<b>64	INT  LIVING ROOM.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT
</b>
	Korben gently kisses the girl's cheeks, but she doesn't respond.  He
looks around then kisses her on the lips.  The girl's eyes snap open.
When Korben straightens up he discovers his own gun jammed under his
chin.

<b>						GIRL
</b>					(angry)
				Eto Akta Gamat!

<b>						KORBEN
</b>					(embarrassed)
				I'm sorry, it's just that... I was
				told to wake you up gently, so I figured...

	The girl pauses a moment.  She stares at him, looks puzzled.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				You're right, I was wrong! I shouldn't
				have kissed you... especially since we
				haven't been introduced and...
					(he pulls out a business card)
				Here, it's a bit late, but... my name is
				Korben, Korben Dallas.
				Keep it, you never know, maybe... you'll
				need a cab one day.  I'll be happy to open
				the door this time!.

	The girl hesitates, then snatches the card like a wild animal.

<b>65	INT.  SMALL  ROOM
</b>
	Cornelius is lost in the closet.

<b>						DAVID
</b>				Father, will you please explain what's
				going on?

<b>						KORBEN
</b>					(polite)
				Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname,
				something a little... shorter?

<b>						GIRL
</b>				...Leeloo.

	Korben is falling in love.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				That's... really cute...

	Cornelius bursts into the room.  She turns the gun on him.
	He bows before her.

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				Appipulai Leeloo Minai..

<b>						LEELOO
</b>				Corn-i-Lius?

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>					(bowing)
				At your service.

	LEELOO lowers her guard starts to laugh.  An irresistible childish laugh.
	Korben smiles.

<b>						DAVID
</b>				Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on
				her gloves!

	David bows low, but his eyes glance up at Leeloo.  Cornelius begins to
lead Korben toward the door, hustling him out.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				They all like this in your family, father?

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				She's an exception..

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				Thank you so much for your help Mr...?

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Dallas. Korben Dallas.

	Cornelius takes his arm. Leeloo stops laughing when she sees Korben
leaving.

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much.
				A thousand times over!

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				I might call to check up on her,
				you know... to see if she's better?

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				She's fine, really..don't you worry..
				just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				I know. I was there when she arrived.

	Cornelius is about to close the door.  Korben's hand blocks it.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something
				to me a while ago and... I don't really get it...
				Akta Gamat?

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				It means, "Never without my permission".

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				That's what I thought.

	Cornelius slams the door in his face.

</b>				...Thanks.

	Korben beads down the hallway. He passes his NEIGHBOR.

	Korben enters his-apartment.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Oh god. I forgot your food ... I'm really sorry!
				How about a nice Thai nosh to apologize?
				How does that sound, huh?

	The cat meows, appeased, just an the phone rings.

shower.  She sits  in front of a computer wolfing down some chicken.  Data
scrolls by on the screen.  David watches from the corner, in awe.

<b>						DAVID
</b>				What's she doing?

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				Learning our history!
				The last 5000 years that she missed!
				She's been out of circulation a while,

	Leeloo breaks into her childish laughter.

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				What're you laughing about?

<b>						LEELOO
</b>					(pronouncing badly)
				Napoleon... small.

	She laughs again and tosses some capsules into the microwave.

<b>						DAVID
</b>					(hesitant)
				Uh father, I know she's been through a lot...
				but the sacred stones..we don't have much
				time..

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				Yes. Of course..

	Leeloo takes her plate out of the microwave.  A steaming plate heaped
with chicken and exotic vegetables.

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				Leeloo..I'm sorry to interrupt you but..

	She sits back down in front of the screen and chomps away heavily on her
second chicken.  Cornelius sits opposite her. and holds up the case
handle.

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>					(serious)
				The case..with the stones...
				Where is it?

<b>						LEELOO
</b>				San Agamat chay bet... envolet!

<b>						CORNELIUS

	Leeloo nods her head, quite unperturbed and continues to devour the food
in front of her.

				Who in gods name would do such

	They reach a door at the end of the corridor.  Zorg enters a code.

<b>						ZORG
</b>				Fire 1000.

<b>						RIGHT ARM
</b>				But... 500 is all they need, sir.

	ZORG turns slowly.  A small scar across run across his face, his eye
stutters.
	This is not a man to cross, or contradict.

<b>						RIGHT ARM
</b>				1000! Fine, sir!
				Sorry to have disturbed you.

	The door opens...

	Leeloo is happy. She pulls off the towel and stands there nude. Cornelius
and David turn away.

</b>				Perfect.

	Leeloo finishes dressing. She is delighted.

	Leeloo settles down, sits at the computer and turns it on.

<b>71	INT.  WAREHOUSE - DAY

	A group of handsome WARRIORS approaches.  AKNOT, their leader has the
sacred case in his hands.  The metal handle is missing but the second
metal glove is still grasping the case.

<b>						ZORG
</b>					(pretending to be worried)
				Aknot?  Is that you?

	The LEADER nods. A disgusted look stamps Zorg's features.

<b>						ZORG
</b>				...What an ugly face! Doesn't suit you at all!
				Take it off...

	AKNOT's face burns away revealing the head of a monstrous MANGALORE.

<b>						ZORG
</b>				That's better! Never be ashamed of
				who you are...
				You're warriors... be proud...

	AKNOT says nothing, but if his eyes could talk!

<b>						ZORG
</b>				So what if the Federal Army crushed your
				entire race and scattered your people to the
				wind...
				Your time for revenge is at hand...
				Voila... the ZF1.

	He takes out a weapon from one a crate and goes into a sales pitch.

<b>						ZORG
</b>					(very fast)
				...It's light... the handle's adjustable for
				easy carrying... good for righties and lefties.

	Meanwhile, two MEN set up a mannequin rigged with various defense
mechanisms at the far end of the warehouse.

<b>						ZORG
</b>				... Breaks down into four parts, undetectable by
				X-rays.. It's the ideal weapon for quick, discreet
				interventions.  A word on fire power: Titanium
				recharger. 3000 round clip with bursts of 3 to 300.
				With the replay button, another Zorg innovation,
				it's even easier... one shot.

	He fires at the mannequin.

<b>						ZORG
</b>				... and replay sends every following shot
				to the same location...

	Zorg spins around, the rounds all hit the mannequin.

<b>						ZORG
</b>					(even faster)
				I recharge, but the enemy has launched a
				cowardly sneak attack from behind, the
				automirror takes care of that.  Gives me the
				time to turn around and finish the job.
				300 round bursts, then there are the Zorg oldies...

	He fires off each item he names.

<b>						ZORG
</b>				...Rocket launcher.  The always efficient
				flame thrower... My favorite.
				Our famous net launcher, the arrow launcher,
				with exploding or poisonous gas heads - very
				practical.
				And for the grand finale, the all-new ice-cube
				system!

	The mannequin has been blasted into a pile of ashes covered by a net,.
stuck with arrows, the whole mess frozen solid. He tosses the weapon into
AKNOT's hands.

<b>						ZORG
</b>				...Four full crates, delivered right on time!
				What about you, my dear Aknot, did
				you bring me what I asked you for?

	AKNOT sets the case on a crate.  Zorg gloats while stroking the case.

<b>						ZORG
</b>				...Magnificent.

	Zorg smiles, takes a deep breath, opens the case.  It's empty

<b>						ZORG
</b>				Alright..I've got an open mind here..
				anyone care to explain?

<b>74	INT.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
	Leeloo explains what happened in her language.

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>					(translating)
				She says that the Guardians never really had
				much faith in humans. They were afraid of
				being attacked. The stones were given to someone
				they could trust who took another route.
				She's supposed to contact this person in a little less
				than twelve hours from now in a hotel.
				She's looking for the address!

	A map of the stars flashes onto the screen, Leeloo points.

<b>						LEELOO
</b>				Dot!

	The little group comes over to look.

	Zorg calmly closes the case and gives Aknot a blood-chilling stare.

<b>						AKNOT
</b>				You asked for a case.
				We brought you a case.

<b>						ZORG
</b>					(shouting)
				A case with four stones in it. Not one!
				Not two or three! But four!!! Four stones!!!
				What the fuck am I supposed to do with an
				EMPTY case?!!

AKNOT's men grow edgy.

<b>						AKNOT
</b>					(tense)
				...We are warriors, not merchants!

<b>						ZORG
</b>					(humored)
				But you can still count.  Look...
				my fingers.

	He holds up four fingers.

<b>						ZORG
</b>				...Four stones, four crates... Zero stones...
					(yelling)
<b>				ZERO CRATES!!!
</b>					(to his men)
				Put everything back, we're outta here.

	AKNOT's warriors turn their weapons on Zorg.

<b>						AKNOT
</b>					(icily)
				We risked our lives. I believe a
				little compensation is in order.

<b>						ZORG
</b>					(smiling)
				So, you are a merchant, after all.
					(to his men)
				Leave them one crate.  For the cause!

	Zorg's men leave a crate and exit with the other three.

<b>						ZORG

				they fight for hopeless causes..for honor!
				Honor has killed millions of people but
				hasn't saved a single one.
					(pause)
				You know what -- do I like though, I like killer.
				  A real dyed in the wool killer.  Cold-blooded.

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				I remember you now..the so called
				art dealer.

<b>						ZORG
</b>				I'm glad you got your memory back, Father...
				Because you're going to need it...
				Where are the stones?

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				...Why on earth do the stones interest you?

<b>						ZORG
</b>				Personally, they are of no interest to me,
				I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer...
				so tell me...

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				Even it I did know where the stones were
				I would never tell somebody like you.

<b>						ZORG
</b>				Why?  What's wrong with me?

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life,
				All you want to do is destroy it.

<b>						ZORG
</b>				Ah, Father... You are so wrong.
				Let me explain...

	Zorg leads Cornelius into his inner office.

<b>						ZORG
</b>				...would you like a drink?

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				No thank you.

<b>						ZORG
</b>				Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve,
				comes from destruction. Look at this empty
				glass.

	Zorg pushes the glass with his finger.

<b>						ZORG
</b>				Here it is... peaceful... serene...
				but if it is...

	Zorg pushes the glass off the table.  It shatters on the floor.

<b>						ZORG
</b>				Destroyed...

	Small individual robots, both free-wheeling and integrated, come zipping
out to clean up the mess.

<b>						ZORG
</b>				...Look at all these little things...
				so busy all of a sudden.
				Notice how each one is useful.
				What a lovely ballet, so full of form
				and color.  So full of..life!

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				They are robots!

	A SERVANT comes in pours water in another glass.  Zorg tosses a cherry
into it.

<b>						ZORG
</b>				Yes but... by that simple gesture of destruction.
				I gave work to at least fifty people today. The
				engineers, the technicians, the mechanics. Fifty
				people who will be able to feed their children so
				they can grow up big and strong.  Children who
				will have children of their own, adding to the great
				cycle of life!

	Cornelius sits in silence.

<b>						ZORG
</b>				Father, by creating a little destruction,
				I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in
				reality, you and I are in the same business!

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people
				with the weapons you produce is quite another.

<b>						ZORG
</b>				Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill
				more people in my entire life than religion has
				killed in the last 2000 years.

	Zorg smiles, holds up the glass and takes a drink.
	Unfortunately, he chokes on the cherry.  Unable to breathe, Zorg starts
to panic.

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>					(mocking)
				Where's the robot to pat your back?

	Zorg falls, writhing, on his desk, inadvertently hitting buttons which
trigger a slew of little mechanisms.  They pop out all over the desk.
True chaos reigns.  Even a cage appears, holding a Souliman Aktapan, a fat
multicolored beastie, PICASSO, who seems surprised to be out in daylight.  He
licks his half-dead master in thanks.  Cornelius gets up and walks around
the desk.  Zorg motions for help.

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				Can I give you a hand?

	Cornelius whacks him on the back.  The cherry comes flying out.  Zorg
regains control of himself. GUARDS come running in.

<b>						ZORG
</b>				You saved my life... So, I'm going
				to spare yours.
					(to the GUARDS)
				Throw him out!

	The GUARDS throw Cornelius out.

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				You are a monster, Zorg!

<b>						ZORG

				I know...

	The GUARDS drag Cornelius out of the office.

<b>						ZORG
</b>				...Torture whoever you want, the

	Communication satellites arrive from all over the place, drawn to it like
a magnet.

<b>						CAPTAIN
</b>					(observing)
				It's gobbling up all the communication
				satellites in the galaxy!

<b>106	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE
</b>
	President Lindberg appears even more crushed by recent events.

<b>						PRESIDENT
</b>				Why the hell is it eating up all those
				satellites like that?

<b>						HEAD SCIENTIST
</b>					(desperate)
				...We're working on it, Mr. President.
				We're working on it.

<b>						PRESIDENT
</b>				It should only choke on them.

	MUNRO enters the office just as a cockroach crawls onto the desk.
There's a small antenna on its back.

<b>107	INT.  SMALL  ROOM
</b>
	Zorg's Right Arm wears earphones, monitoring the President's conversation
with the cockroach-spy.

</b>
<b>						MUNRO
</b>				I managed to contact the Mondoshawan.
				They deplore the incident, but accept our
				apologies.

<b>						PRESIDENT
</b>					(relieved)
				And the Stones?  Did you find them in the
				wreckage?

<b>						MUNRO
</b>				The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.

<b>						PRESIDENT
</b>					(surprised)
				...What do you mean?

	The President is all ears.

	So is Zorg's Right Arm.

<b>						MUNRO
</b>				The Mondoshawan never fully trusted the
				human race..they felt we're too unpredictable..
				so they gave up the Stones to somebody they
				do trust. Her name is Plavalaguna. She's a Diva
				and she's going to sing at the charity ball on
				Fhloston Paradise in a few hours.  She has the
				Stones with her.

	The President breathes easier.

	Zorg's Right Arm is delighted.

<b>						PRESIDENT
</b>					(taking off a shoe)
				Excellent!

	The President crushes the cockroach with his shoe.

	Right Arm's earphones fly off his head. Good-bye eardrums.

<b>						MUNRO
</b>				Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.

<b>110	INT.  KORBEN'S  APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
	C.U. The most disgusting dessert ever made.  Korben looks at it shimmying
on a plate as the Thai serves it to him proudly.

<b>						THAI
</b>				Stewed jellyfish cake.. my speciality..

	Korben forces a weak, polite smile as the Thai looks on expectantly.  The
phone rings.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Saved by the bell.

	Korben rises to get his cigarettes, and answer the phone.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				...Hello?

<b>						MOTHER (V.O.)
</b>				You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in
				this stinking City!

<b>						KORBEN
</b>					(resigned)
				Hi Ma...

<b>						MOTHER (V.O.)
</b>				I've been playing twice a week for 20 years,
				20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.

	Korben goes to light his cigarette.  There are only two matches left in
the match box.
	Korben strikes one and it fizzles.

<b>						MOTHER (V.O.)
</b>				You wouldn't even eat one to help your
				poor mother, and you win the big prize?
				Know something? The whole thing makes
				me sick!

	The Thai starts to clean up.  Just as Korben goes to strike the second
match..

<b>						MOTHER (V.O.)
</b>				Are you listening to me, you ingrate!

<b>						KORBEN
</b>					(resigned)
				Yes ma..

	Korben sighs and puts the match back in the box.

	Korben enters his code on the keypad the Thai is holding.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>					(to the Thai)
				Go on... This is gonna take a while!

The Thai casts oft.  Korben closes the window.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Other than that... You all right?

<b>						MOTHER (V.O.)
</b>				...And now you're making fun of me?
				I'm warning you! If you don't take me
				after all these years of sacrifice, I'll
				never forgive you!!

	The Thai flies off.  In the hall, the cat meows-for more food.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>					(to the cat)
				I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking
				about?

<b>						MOTHER (V.O.)
</b>				I get it! You want to make me beg,
				is that it?

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				All I want is an explanation! I just got
				in, I lost my job. I smashed my cab.
				I got mugged, but other than that
				everything's peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!!
				Now settle down and explain to me calmly..

	A message drops in his tube.  The red light goes on.

<b>						MOTHER (V.O.)
</b>				You just won a trip, you dolt!
				Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it.
				Someone would have notified me.

<b>						MOTHER (V.O.)
</b>				They've been blaring out your name on
				the radio for the last hour, blockhead!

	He eyeballs the message still in the tube.  The doorbell rings.-

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Ma.. it's the door. I'll call you back.

	Korben hangs up before his mother can say anything and heads for the
door.  Before he gets there it opens, General Munro enters followed by a
Captain and a Major.
	MAJOR ICEBORG is a woman. All she needs to become a man is a mustache.
	Munro opens a file.

<b>						MUNRO
</b>					(clipped)
				Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct
				you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal
				Army on your enlistment which is more than
				you will need for a mission of the utmost
				importance.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				What mission?

<b>						MUNRO
</b>				To save the world.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Where have I heard this song before?

<b>						MUNRO
</b>				You're to leave immediately for Fhloston
				Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the
				Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with
				the utmost discretion as possible.
				Any questions'?

<b>						KORBEN
</b>					(a little bewildered)
				Just one... why me?

<b>						MUNRO
</b>				Three reasons... One: As part of The Elite
				Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army
				you are an expert in the use of all weapons
				and spacecraft needed for this mission.

	Munro pulls out a long list of documents.

<b>						MUNRO
</b>				Two: Of all the members of your unit
				you were the most highly decorated.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				And the third one?

<b>						MUNRO
</b>				You're the only one left alive...

	Munro removes the message Korben hasn't bothered to look at.

<b>						MUNRO
</b>				Don't you open your messages?

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				I've had enough good news for today

<b>						MUNRO
</b>					(by rote)
				You have won the annual Gemini contest
				and a trip to Fhloston Paradise. For two.
				Congratulations.
				Here are your tickets.

	He hands Korben the tickets.  Korben gets it.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				You rigged the contest?

	Munro nods.

<b>						MUNRO
</b>				Major Iceborg will accompany you...
				as your wife...

	The idea of taking a trip with Iceborg makes him sick.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>					(sarcastic)
				You couldn't come up with something
				a little more discreet?

<b>						MUNRO
</b>				Old tricks are the best tricks eh?

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				I'm not going.

<b>						MUNRO
</b>				Why not?

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				One reason... I want to stay the only
				one left alive.

<b>110A	INT.  KORBEN'S  HALL
</b>
	Leeloo and Cornelius search for Korben's apartment. Leeloo carries the
card Korben gave her.  Cornelius finds the apartment, and yanks the.
number off the door.  He waves Leeloo over as his hand goes to the bell.

<b>110B	INT.  KORBEN'S  APARTMENT
</b>
	The doorbell rings.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				...Scuse me.

	Korben goes to the door and looks out the peephole: the beautiful Leeloo.
	Korben panics, overcome with happiness.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				...Shit!

<b>						MUNRO
</b>					(worried)
				What is it?

	Korben has two seconds to make up something to get rid of Munro.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				It's my wife.

<b>						MUNRO
</b>				I thought you were divorced.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				I mean my future.. my ex.. My future ex..
				if she sees you here I'm finished.  She hates
				you guys. It's what killed us in the first place.
				Please...

	He puts them in the fridge, shoving the jellyfish cake in Iceborg's
hands.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice!
				It'll only take a minute! Let me set up
				another meeting and I'll be back.

<b>						MUNRO
</b>				Three of us will never fit in there!

<b>						KORBEN
</b>					(pushing him)
				Oh, yes you will...

	Korben slams the fridge door.  The doorbell RINGS again.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				...Coming!

	He whips through his place in ten seconds, gathers up things laying
about,
	shuts drawers, rolls up his laundry in the folding bed. He brushes his
hair back
	and opens the door with a big smile only to discover a gun stuck between
his
	eyes held by Cornelius.

<b>						LEELOO
</b>				Apipoulai!

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				I suppose that means "Hi" ?

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				I'm sorry to have to resort to such
				methods, but we heard about your
				good luck on he radio and we need
				the tickets to Fhloston.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Is that the usual way priests go on
				vacation?

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				We're not going on vacation..we're
				on a mission..

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				What kind of mission?

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>					(sincere)
				We have to save the world.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>					(skeptical)
				Good luck..

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				Of course.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Father, I was in the Army for awhile
				and every time they told us we were
				on a mission to save the world the
				only thing that changed was I lost a
				lot of friends. So thanks for the offer..
				but no thanks.

	Cornelius is disappointed.  Leeloo looks crestfallen.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				I'm sorry..

<b>						VOICE
</b>				This is a police control action..

	Everyone freezes as the whole building resounds with the electronic
voice.

<b>111	INT.  LANDING  KORBEN'S  BUILDING
</b>
	A group of POLICEMEN bursts into the hallway.  One of the cops enters a
code on the police wall box.  A device descends from the ceiling, a
flashing light-siren,
	a VOICE fills the air.

<b>						VOICE
</b>				This is not an exercise.
				This is a police control.

	Cornelius starts to panic.  Korben takes charge.

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				Oh my god oh my god..

	Korben pushes a button sending the fridge to the next floor.  A shower
takes it's place.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Leeloo, hide in here and don't move!

	Leeloo hops in.  Korben tosses Cornelius on the bed.

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				What are you doing?

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Trying to save your ass so you can
				save the world.

	..and hits a button on the wall.  The bed disappears into the wall.

	Korben grabs his tickets and slides them in his belt.

<b>112	INT.  LANDING  KORBEN'S  BUILDING - DAY
</b>
	Meanwhile, the automatic police voice continues.

<b>						VOICE
</b>				...Spread your legs and place your
				hands in the yellow circles, please.

	A COP slaps a viewer device on Korben's door which makes part of it
transparent.

<b>						COP 1
</b>				Put your hands in the yellow circles,
				please.

	Korben takes his time hiding his face. The Cop looks at his sheet. He's
looking for
	a... KORBEN DALLAS. He has his picture, but it is Korben with long hair
and beard.

<b>						COP 1
</b>					(to COP 2)
				Sir? Are you a human?

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				No, I'm a meat popsicle.

<b>						COP 3
</b>					(at the other end of the hall)
				I found him!

	C.U. Korben's calling card is clumsily stuck to the door of the
neighbor's apartment.  COP 3 slaps the viewer on the nasty neighbor's door.
The neighbor is at his sink shaving instead of against the wall, COP 1
arrives with Korben's picture.

<b>						COP 1
</b>				Sir, this is a control.  Please put your
				hands in the yellow circles.

	The neighbor steps right up to the viewer, shaving cream on his face.  He
could pass for Korben.

<b>						NEIGHBOR
</b>				Fuck you!!

<b>113	INT.  KORBEN'S  APARTMENT
</b>
	Korben still has his hands to the wall.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Wrong answer.

	SHOT O.S. EXPLOSION.  Scuffle.

<b>114	INT.  HALL
</b>
	The riot police hustle down the hall dragging the neighbor behind them in
a canvas bag.  A cop is on the wall phone.

<b>						COP
</b>				OK, we got the guy under wraps.

<b>115	INT.  ZORG'S  OFFICE
</b>
	Right Arm is on the phone, facing Zorg.

<b>						COP (O.S.)
</b>				It was not easy, but we bagged him!.
				Thanks for the tip!

<b>						RIGHT ARM
</b>					(smiling)
				Glad to help.

	He hangs up.

<b>						RIGHT ARM
</b>				They just arrested the guy for Uranium
				smuggling. Everything's going as planned.

	He shows him a plane ticket, and a passport with his picture and Korben's
name.

<b>						RIGHT ARM
</b>				All I have to do now is to go to the
				airport and take his place.  I should be
				in Fhloston in less than four hours.

	Zorg sits there quietly for a moment.

<b>						ZORG
</b>				Don't come back without the Stones.

<b>116	INT.  KORBEN'S  APARTMENT
</b>
	Korben opens the shower door.  Leeloo is soaking wet, her teeth
chattering from the cold.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				I'm really sorry.. there wasn't time.

His eyes fall on an old blanket.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Here let me wrap you up.

	Korben wraps her in an blanket and vigoroualy rubs her back.  Leeloo
warms gradually and snuggles closer to that warm comfortable shoulder.
Korben's rubbing slows, looking more like caresses.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>			..It's funny.  I've met you twice today  and
			you've ended up in my arms both times.

	Leeloo suddenly realizes that she has maybe gone a bit too far.
	She recovers, looking embarrassed too.

<b>						LEELOO
</b>					(nicely)
				Valo massa... Chacha hamas.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Uh..you're welcome.

	The intimacy makes him nervous.  He looks for a diversion.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Coffee!  That's what you need!
				A nice, hot cup of coffee!

	He pushes a button on the coffee machine.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				With some honey!  You'll see, honey's
				great!...

	Korben rummages through the drawer.  Leeloo, innocent, doesn't seem to
quite understand everything that is going on.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				A hot cup of coffee... with honey...

	He rummages through the cupboard, exceedingly nervous.  Leeloo smiles and
begins to look around.  She opens a drawer and comes upon..

<b>						KORBEN
</b>					(nervously)
				I've got this great honey somewhere.
				You know about honey?  There used to be
				these little animals who made it with antenna...

	..pictures of Major Korben Dallas War Hero.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				..and these other animals who ate it..
				one were bees the other were bears..

	She looks back to the man fumbling for honey.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				I forget which ate it and which made it
				but..

	And she smiles.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Here it is!

	Korben holds up the jar of honey.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Taste this...

	Leeloo innocently sticks his finger in the jar then puts it in her mouth.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				It... melts in your mouth, doesn't it?

	She savors the honey, slowly; sensually.  Her lips shine with honey.  Her
eyes narrow with pleasure.  Korben is hypnotized by her lips, like a moth
attracted to a flame.  He begins to lose control, which makes him nervous.

	An indistinct sound comes from the wall.  But Korben is so entranced with
the sight of Leeloo licking her honied fingers, he doesn't hear it until
it becomes quite a racket.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				You hear that?

<b>						LEELOO
</b>					(licking)
				Cornelius..

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Oh god!

	Korben pushes the button on the wall.  The bed pops out, fully made, with
Cornelius tucked in it, struggling to get out.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				I'm really sorry.. let me help you..

Korben begins to pull at the covers when..

<b>						LEELOO
</b>				Achta ge lumitai de matala..

	Korben turns..

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				What?

	He turns to Leeloo struggling out of her wet clothes. His breath is taken
away by the sight of her perfect body.

	Cornelius whacks him heavily on the head with a lamp.  Korben drops to
the floor.

<b>						LEELOO
</b>					(displeased)
				Vano da, mechteba?!
				Soun domo kala chon hammas!

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				No, I'm not proud of myself...
				But we don't have the luxury of choice.

<b>117	INT.  ENTRANCE  KORBEN'S  BUILDING - DAY
</b>
	The POLICE exit the elevator and head for the front door.  A cop suddenly
takes a hit from a silencer, then a second. Others are bashed on the head
by MANGALORE warriors.  One of them picks up the prisoner bag, takes it
into a small shed.

<b>118	INT.  SHED
</b>
	Aknot, the Mangalore leader, is seriously wounded and can't walk.

<b>						AKANIT
</b>				Korben Dallas!  We got him.

<b>						AKNOT
</b>				Perfect... Take command, Akanit.
				Go to Fhloston and get the Stones...
				If Zorg really wants them... He'll have
				to negotiate.  Revenge is at hand.

<b>119	INT.  KORBEN'S APARTMENT  KORBEN'S  BUILDING - DAY
</b>
	Korben gets unsteadily to his feet, some blood drips down his face. He
daubs at it.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Jesus!... Some priest!

	The phone rings, he manages to answer.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Yeah?

<b>						MOTHER (V.O)
</b>				Have you pulled yourself together?

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				...Not yet.

	He hangs up.

	Korben opens the fridge door.  The three officers are frozen solid.
Korben grabs some ice, presses it to his forehead.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				I'll take the mission.

	He closes the door.

<b>120	INT. AIRPORT  HALL - DAY
</b>
	Cornelius and Leeloo (still damp) arrive at the Manhattan Intergalactic
Airport.
	A huge hall three quarters filled with trash piled up to the ceiling.

	There are groups of extra-terrestrials on strike standing in trash
holding picket signs.  A SECURITY GUARD picks up a phone off the wall.

<b>						SECURITY GUARD
</b>				Illegal gathering in Zone 4.

	A hand taps Leeloo from behind.  She whips around catching David in the
face.

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				Leeloo, be careful.

	He turns to David who in holding his bloody nose.

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				Did you get them?

	David hands Cornelius two passports.

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				Excellent... Leeloo Dallas.

	He hands it to her.  The name makes her smile.

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				And Korben David Dallas.

	She frowns.

<b>						LEELOO
</b>				Akta dedero ansila do mektet.

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				I can't pretend to be your husband...
				David's in great shape.

	She looks at David holding his bloody nose.

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				He'll protect you. Go on... See the Diva...
				get the Stones... See you at the temple...
				God be with you.

	ANGLE ON: Korben comes rushing into the airport. Walking quickly, he
scopes the hall looking for Leeloo. A POLICE PATROL bearing down on the
STRIKERS jostles him. The cops open fire.  The strikers dive into the garbage
and disappear.

<b>121	INT.  BOARDING  GATE
</b>
	David nervously puts tickets and IDs on the check-in counter.
	Leeloo tosses her suitcase on the conveyor belt.

<b>						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
</b>				Congratulations on winning the contest.

	David gives her a bleak smile.  Leeloo rolls her eyes.

	Back a ways, Korben has spotted Leeloo and... David.  He heads right for
them.  Leeloo's seen him. She is both delighted and panicked.  David's
seen nothing.  Korben presses one of his fingers like a gun to David's back.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>					(friendly)
				Hey! I really thought I was going to
				miss my flight!
					(to David)
				Thanks, kid! You put the luggage on
				the conveyor belt?

<b>						DAVID
</b>					(freaking)
				Uh... yeah.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>					(smiling)
				Great! Now beat it!

	Paralyzed, David leaves.  Korben turns to the attendant.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Excuse me.  I was so afraid I'd miss the
				flight that I sent the kid here to pick up
				my boarding card.

	He looks at David's fake ID.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				...My cousin David...

	Leeloo is unable to hold back a smile.

<b>						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
</b>					(looking at Leeloo's ID)
				Your wife?

	Korben grabs the ID and reads it.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Uh, yes... Newlyweds.
					(aside)
				You know how it is... Love at first sight.
				You meet, something goes tilt,. you get
				married, you hardly know each other.
				Right, darling?

	Leeloo rips her boarding card out of the attendant's hand.

<b>						LEELOO
</b>					(sharply)
				Dinoine chagantakat!

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Took the words right out of my mouth.
				Go on... I'll be right with you.
					(to Check-in Attendant)
				It's our honeymoon. We're going to use
				the trip to get to know each other better.

	He winks at the stewardess.

<b>	ANGLE ON:
</b>
	The neighbor and a tawdry young girl cross the airport.  The couple in
almost knocked over by a police patrol holding a 500 pound PIG on a
stainless steel leash. The couple panics a moment, the realize the patrol
isn't for them. The pig heads for the pile where the strikers disappeared.

<b>						COP
</b>					(to pig)

				Come on, snyffer, go root!

	The pig piles into the garbage.  The Cop cuts it some slack.
	Cornelius sits at a bar.

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>					(to the bartender)
				I feel so guilty sending her to do the dirty
				work. I know she was made to be strong
				but she's also so fragile... So human.
				You know what I mean?

	The bartender, a robot, nods his head as he pours Cornelius a drink.

<b>	ANGLE ON:
</b>
	The nasty neighbor and his wife hand their tickets to the check-in
attendant.

<b>						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
</b>					(surprised)
				Dallas... Korben...

<b>						NEIGHBOR
</b>					(in a different voice)
				Yes, that's me.

	The check-in attendant triggers a transparent blue light that shines on
their faces, revealing two other faces:

	Mangalores.

<b>						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
</b>					(smiling)
				Just a minute, please.

	She hits a silent alarm, but the Mangalores feel something is wrong.

<b>						NEIGHBOR
</b>				We'll be right back ... we're gonna
				check out the duty free...

	They spin around and hurry away.

<b>	ANGLE ON:
</b>
	Cornelius at the bar, half in the bag.

<b>						ROBOT
</b>				The same?

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				Yeah...

<b>						DAVID (V.O.)
</b>				Make that two...

	Cornelius turns to David.

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				Where's Leeloo?

<b>						DAVID
</b>				On the plane... with Mr. Dallas...
				the real one.

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				It's all my fault.  I'm the servant...
				It's my mission! Here!

	He hands David the Temple Key from around his neck.

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				Here's the key to the Temple..
				Prepare for our arrival!

	Cornelius tosses David's drink into his own, downs it all in one shot,
and takes off, passing the Mangalore couple headed for the exit.  They are
very nervous.
	A police patrol is coming.  This time, it seems to be for them.

<b>						NEIGHBOR
</b>					(to the tawdry girl)
				Tell Aknot plan A flopped.
				Tell him to go to plan B.

	The tawdry girl nods and peels off. The neighbor takes out a gun and
blasts away at the cops.  The cops fire back. A firefight rages in the
hall. The tawdry girl dives into a pile of garbage and disappears.

<b>						COP
</b>					(into walkie-talkie)
				...Send in a back-up unit, Zone 7!

<b>	ANGLE ON:
</b>
	On one side of the hall, a trap door opens. Three pigs come running out,
grabbed by their police handler.

	Cornelius waits until everyone has left, gets down on all fours and
crawls through the trapdoor reserved for the pigs.

<b>122	INT.  FIRST  CLASS  LOUNGE
</b>
	Leeloo stands at the buffet in the first class lounge eating everything
in sight.

<b>123	INT.  HALL
</b>
	Korben is led down the hall by a STEWARDESS.

<b>						STEWARDESS
</b>				You are so lucky... Loc Rhod is the
				coolest DJ in the universe.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Listen... I don't want to be interviewed.
				I'd prefer to remain anonymous.

	The stewardess stops in the corridor.

<b>						STEWARDESS
</b>				Forget anonymous.  You'll be doing Loc
				Rhod's live show every day from 5 to 7!

<b>						KORBEN
</b>					(expression changes)
				You gotta be kidding!

	The stewardess smiles and shakes her head.  The door next to him suddenly
swings open and smashes him in the face.

	In walks LOC RHOD amidst a tornado of music and security guards.  He is
young, good-looking, eccentric, charming as an elf or sly as a fox.  A
bundle of energy.  He is the 24th century's most popular DJ.

<b>						LOC RHOD
</b>					(speedy, in rhythm)
				Korben Dallas! Here he is The most hated
				man in the universe. The one and only winner
				of the Gemini Croquette contest! Ladies, start
				melting 'cause the boy's hot! Hot! Hot! The boy
				is perfect..
					(he feels his muscles)
				...The right size, right build, right hair.  Right on!
				Say something-to those 50 billion pair of ears out
				there D-man!

	An ASSISTANT hands a totally lost Korben a mike.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>					(hesitant)
				...Hi.

<b>						LOC RHOD
</b>				Does it get any better or what!

	Loc Rhod grabs Korben's arm and leads him down the hallway, as fast as
the music.

<b>						LOC RHOD
</b>				...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on
				fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know
				everything there is to know about the D-man.
				His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of

				intimate is the stud muffin's middle name.
				So tell me my main man... you nervous in the
				service?

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Uh... not really.

	Loc Rhod lets go of Korben's arm and grabs the Stewardess.

<b>						LOC RHOD
</b>				Freeze those knees, my chickadees, 'cause
				Korben is on the case with a major face...

	Loc Rhod rubs up against the stewardess.

<b>						LOC RHOD
</b>				...Start drooling, ladies! My man here is a
				sharp-tongued Sire who's gonna stroke your
				every desire.

	They come to an intersection.  The airline company has prepared drinks
for them.  Loc Rhod pushes on, grabs a glass of champagne, scribbles his
autograph.

<b>						LOC RHOD
</b>				Yesterday's unknown will be tomorrow's Prince
				of Fhloston Paradise, the hotel of a thousand and
				one follies, home of luxury and beauty.  A magic
				fountain flowing with non-stop wine, women and
				Bootchie Koochie Koo...

	He tosses away his champagne glass.

<b>						LOC RHOD
</b>				Beware out there puppy dogs my man is on
				the prowl. Owwww!

	Howling, Loc Rhod grabs another stewardess by the arm.

<b>						LOC RHOD
</b>				...And start licking your stamps little girls,
				this guy's gonna have you writing home to
				Momma! Tomorrow from 5 to 7, I'll be your
				voice, your tongue and I'll be hot on the tail
				of the sexiest man of the year... D-man...
				Your man... My man.

	The stewardess shivers.  A BEEP is heard.

<b>						VOCODER (O.S.)
</b>				End of transmission.

	The MUSIC suddenly stops.  Several assistants come and compliment Loc
Rhod who sighs, lights up a cigarette, and drops his pretense.

<b>						LOC RHOD
</b>				Korben sweetheart do me a favor I know this
				is probably the biggest thing that ever happened
				to you in your inconsequential life. But I've got
				a show to do here and it's got to pop. So tomorrow,
				when we're on air, give me a hand... Try to make
				believe you have more than a one word vocabulary.
				OK pal?

	That does it.  Korben grabs him by the collar and drags him into a
corner.
	Loc Rhod's feet don't touch the ground.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>					(pissed)
				I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio.
				So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a
				hand, that clear pal?

<b>						LOC RHOD
</b>					(petrified)
				Crystal.

<b>124	INT.  AIRPORT
</b>
	The Check-in attendant has two more tickets in her hand.

<b>						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
</b>					(alter a moment, reading)
				...Mr. Dallas... Korben Dallas?

	Zorg's Right Arm gives her a big smile.

<b>						RIGHT ARM
</b>				That's right.

	The attendant scans the ID with a yellow beam, it checks out, and the
blue light reveals no other face but his.

<b>						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
</b>				The problem is I only have one Korben Dallas on
				my list... and he's already checked in.

	Right Arm's smile shatters.

<b>						RIGHT ARM
</b>				That's impossible!  He's in j... I mean, there
				must be some mistake. I have my ticket!
				I'm the real Korben Dallas!

	A shrill BELL rings out.

<b>						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
</b>					(smiling)
				I'm sorry, sir, boarding is finished.

	The attendant hits a button.  A thick window slowly slides up between
them.
	Right Arm totally loses it.

<b>						RIGHT ARM
</b>				I want to see your boss!  Get rid of this
				fucking window! Somebody's made a
				mistake, goddamnit!

	He pounds on the counter with both fists. A steel curtain comes down.
Red sighting beams target spots on his body, ten gun barrels protrude from
the wall, all aimed at him.

<b>						VOICE (O.S.)
</b>				This is not an exercise.  This is a police
				control.
				Put your hands in the nearest yellow circles...

<b>						RIGHT ARM
</b>					(slowing down)
				Sorry, my fault... Just a little overexcited...
				that's all... I'm calm now.

<b>125	INT.  SHUTTLE - DAY
</b>
	Korben makes his way in the plane  looking for his seat. No more seats in
modern planes, just individual travel boxes lined up like microwaves.  He
passes STEWARD holding his bloodied nose. He has found what he is looking
for. He enters to.... Leeloo quietly stretched out in front of a computer
screen.  Korben slips in beside her.  Leeloo in concentrating on the words
that scroll rapidly  past her on the screen.  He doesn't understand what she
is doing.

<b>						LEELOO
</b>				Apipoulai!

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Not hard to find you...just follow the
				Chaos...

	Leeloo smiles, as if complimented.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Leeloo, listen to me... these tickets...
				they're not mine... I mean they are, but
				not for vacation like everyone thinks...
				I'm on an operation... and if I didn't come
				get you, you'd be in a shitload of trouble...
				I'd love to be on vacation with you...
				but now.... now I've got to work...
				And Leeloo... I would love to work in peace.

	Leeloo types in "LOVE" on the keyboard.

<b>						LEELOO
</b>				Love...

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word
				here, PEACE is!

	Leeloo types in this new word.

<b>						LEELOO
</b>					(rather pleased)
				Peace... and love...

	She brings up a picture of a 60's style Hippie flashing a peace sign.
Korben sighs and switches off the screen.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Sometimes you can't learn everything
				from a screen..sometimes it's better to
				ask someone who has experience..

<b>						LEELOO
</b>					(quite happy)
				What is... Make Love?

	Korben just stares at her for a few minutes.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Know what? On that subject maybe you'd
				be better off asking the screen.

	He turns the computer back on.

<b>	ANGLE ON:
</b>
	A STEWARDESS walks up the aisle of the shuttle pushing the red buttons on
top of each individual box.

<b>						VOICE (O.S.)
</b>				...to make your flight as short and agreeable
				as possible, our flight attendants are switching
				on the timing sleeper which will regulate your
				sleep during the trip...

<b>	ANGLE ON:
</b>
<b>						LEELOO
</b>					(switching off the screen)
				OK! Finished!

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Finished what?

<b>						LEELOO
</b>				Learning language.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Which one?

<b>						LEELOO
</b>				All 900.

	Korben doesn't know if he should laugh or not.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				You learned 900 languages in five
				minutes?!

<b>						LEELOO
</b>					(pleased)
				Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your
				language, you have to learn mine!

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how
				to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.

<b>						LEELOO
</b>				Apipoussan!

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Apipoussan?

<b>						LEELOO
</b>				Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?

<b>						KORBEN
</b>					(fumbling)
				Uh...

<b>						LEELOO
</b>				...Hoppi-hoppa.

	Korben literally melts.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>					(to himself)
				Help...

	Luckily, a stewardess smiles at him through the box window.

<b>						STEWARDESS
</b>				Sweet dreams, Mr. Dallas!

	The stewardess sets the timing sleeper.  Korben and Leeloo immediately
fall asleep.

	A STEWARDESS at the other end of the shuttle has a problem.

<b>						STEWARDESS 2
</b>				Mr. Loc Rhod you have to assume
				your individual position.

<b>						LOC RHOD
</b>					(hugging her)
				I don't want an individual position,
				I want all positions!

<b>127	INT.  AIRPORT  LANDING  STRIP - DAY
</b>
	A GROUND CREW MEMBER goes over to the truck parked under one of the
plane's wings and bangs on the side of it with a shout.

<b>						GROUND CREW MEMBER
</b>				Disinfecting!

	Two DISINFECTORS in hermetically sealed suits exit the truck.  They go
over to the front landing gear and send up a whooshing beam.  The flame
burns everything it touches.  A pack of repugnant creatures falls squealing
from the landing gear.  A small trapdoor is opened under the shuttle and a
huge slightly phosphorescent tube falls out.

<b>128	INT.  AIRPORT  HALL / ZORG'S  OFFICE
</b>
	Zorg's Right Arm is in a phone booth in the middle of the hall.

<b>						RIGHT ARM
</b>				Yeah, it's me... Put Zorg on.

	He is already sweating.

<b>						ZORG

				He took my place.

</b>				I'll call you back.

<b>134  EXT.  LANDING  STRIP
</b>
	The runway is now empty. A man slips out of the shadows. It's Cornelius.
He scurries over to the front landing gear. He pauses for an instant, the
climbs up the wheel well and disappears inside the shuttle.

<b>135	INT.  SHUTTLE
</b>
	The pilots are going through the pre-flight check list.

<b>						COPILOT
</b>				Anti static pressure?

</b>				Primed.

	The mechanic presses a series of buttons.

<b>136	INT.  CABIN

	Loc Rhod undoes a series of buttons on the stewardess' blouse, behind a
curtain. He whispers a poem.  Impossible to resist him. Outside the
curtain the stewardess' legs rise slowly.

</b>
	On the ground, protective fire curtains rise slowly to contain the engine
exhaust on liftoff.

lift her of.

	- Zorg finishes gleefully typing in the number.

<b>						ZORG
</b><b>				3... 2... 1...
</b>
	- The engines at full blast.

	- The stewardess in close to screaming.

<b>						PILOT
</b>				Liftoff.

	- The copilot pushes a button.

	- So does Zorg.

	- The engines release their full power.

	- The stewardess screams in ecstasy.

everything else   within 60 feet.

	Korben and Leeloo sleep soundly in their box.  Leeloo has a smile on her
face and her hand in Korben's.

<b>143	EXT.  OUTERSPACE - NIGHT
</b>
	The spaceship rockets past us, then suddenly vanishes with amazing speed.
Space is now empty and calm.  Billions of stars glow in perfect silence.


<b>144	EXT.  SPACE
</b>
	The nefarious planet in still there, immobile, even larger now, writhing
like a serpent.  Then, suddenly, for no apparent reason, all activity stops
and it becomes gray and cold.

<b>145	INT.  SPACESHIP
</b>
	In the Admiral's starship, scientists watch the measuring device.  One of
the devices suddenly starts working.

<b>						TECHNICIAN
</b>				All right! We're finally getting something!

<b>146	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE
</b>
	The Head Scientist stands facing the President, who is looking more tired
than ever.

<b>						HEAD SCIENTIST
</b>				The thing is sending out radio wavelengths!

<b>						PRESIDENT
</b>				What the hell does it want with radio waves?

<b>						HEAD SCIENTIST
</b>				...Probably wants to make a call!

	The President and his Generals look at him in astonishment.

<b>147	INT.  ZORG'S OFFICE
</b>
	Picasso purrs contentedly on Zorg's lap.  The phone rings.

<b>						SECRETARY (O.S.)
</b>				Mr. Shadow on the line.

	Zorg shoots to his feet.  Picasso tumbles to the floor.  Zorg picks up
the phone, both excited and uneasy. He stands there, almost coming to
attention.

<b>						ZORG
</b>				Yes... Zorg here.

	The voice is feeble.  It comes from the far reaches of time, from the
bowels of the universe.

<b>						SHADOW
</b>				Am I disturbing you?

<b>						ZORG
</b>				No... not at all.  Where are you?

	SHADOW'S breathing is awesome.

<b>						SHADOW
</b>				...Not far, now.

<b>						ZORG
</b>				Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen
				and see you at last!

	Zorg brings up a huge screen and pushes a few buttons.

	In the middle of an electronic snowstorm, a blackish, vaguely human,
quiverinq form appears. Two eyes, like lava, give an idea where the head is.
Zorg feels sick.

<b>						SHADOW
</b>				Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?

<b>						ZORG
</b>				Got it.

<b>						SHADOW
</b>				How's our deal coming along?

<b>						ZORG
</b>					(ill at ease)
				Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you
				asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy.
				My costs have tripled.

	Shadow pauses an instant.  A black slimy liquid starts to ooze from the
top of the screen.  Zorg is feeling worse all the time.

<b>						SHADOW
</b>				Money is of no importance...
				I want the Stones!

	The black liquid oozes all over the screen which starts to melt.  Zorg
sweats profusely,  his legs tremble.

<b>						ZORG
</b>				The Stones will be here. I'll see to it
				personally!

<b>						SHADOW
</b>				...I can't wait to be among you.

	Zorg sighs and sits down totally freaked.

<b>148	EXT. ORBIT  FHLOSTON  PARADISE
</b>
	The space shuttle fills the screen.  It banks left and begins its descent
toward Fhloston, the turquoise planet.  Crystal blue water, perfect white sand
beaches.  A true paradise.

<b>149	INT.  SPACE SHUTTLE
</b>
	The stewardess picks up a microphone to make an announcement.

<b>						STEWARDESS
</b>				Ladies and gentlemen, we have begun our
				descent toward Fhloston Paradise...

	Stewardesses walk down the aisles waking the passengers one by one. They
press a button on the door of each box.

	In the corner, Loc Rhod and the stewardess awake with a start and
straighten their clothes quickly.  The stewardess is embarrassed.

<b>						STEWARDESS
</b>					(timidly)
				I wanted to tell you that...

	Loc Rhod puts on his sunglasses and presses a finger to her lips.  He
disappears behind the curtain leaving the sighing stewardess on her own.

<b>150	EXT.  FHLOSTON  PARADISE
</b>
	The spaceship descends through some clouds and glides over a vast
turquoise sea.  Fhloston Paradise looms into view.  An enormous oceanliner
floating a dozen yards above the water.  On closer inspection it is more
modern than a traditional oceanliner.  The shuttle draws near, looking
ridiculously small next to the monster.  Like a sardine next to a whale.

<b>151	INT.  COCKPIT
</b>
	A blinking light goes on.

<b>						PILOT
</b>				Shit! Parasites in Zone 1. Take a look.

	The 1st Mate heads off.

<b>152	INT.  CABIN

	A stewardess opens Korben's box door.  He is still heavy with sleep. He
looks over at Leeloo.  She's not there.

<b>153	EXT.  FHLOSTON

	The tiny space shuttle clings to the huge oceanliner.

<b>154	INT.  COCKPIT

	The Pilot maneuvers the ship into it's docking area.

<b>						PILOT
</b>				Docking activated.
				You can let the passengers out.

<b>155	INT.  REAR  OF  COCKPIT

	The 1st mate pries open the door to an overhead panel.  Cornelius falls
out, hanging in a jumble of wires.

<b>156.	INT.  ENTRANCE  HALL  FHLOSTON PARADISE - DAY
</b>
	The enormous door opens and the passengers exit.  Leeloo is among them.
She appears quite impressed by the beauty and luxury of the 19th century
decoration.

<b>157	INT.  CABIN
</b>
	Korben attempts to make his way up the shuttle's aisle.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>					(jostling everybody)
				Pardon me.  Excuse me. I'm trying to
				reach my wife.. Sorry!

<b>158	INT.  ENTRANCE  HALL
</b>
	A dozen policemen wait patiently at the end of the hall.  Leeloo stops
and presses against the wall.  She spots Korben leaving the shuttle.  A
gorgeous HOSTESS comes up to him, drapes a lei around his neck and plants a
kiss on his lips in welcome.

<b>						HOSTESS
</b>					(smiling)
				Welcome to Paradise.

	Korben's face is covered in lipstick.  Leeloo sees he did nothing to stop
the girl and she doesn't like it.

	A HEFTY MAN wearing a sarong drapes some flowers around her neck.  Then,
	obviously relishing it, he leans down to kiss her.  Leeloo bashes him on
the forehead.  The hefty man straightens up.  He's still smiling, but his
nose is bleeding. He falls slowly to the floor.

	Korben pushes forward trying to spot Leeloo.  He also tries to wipe the
lipstick off.  Leeloo tries to escape through a door marked PERSONNEL ONLY,
but it's locked.  A HOST looks at her with a grin.

<b>						HOST
</b>					(playful)
				If you don't have the code you can't
				open it!

	Leeloo smiles and punches in an old code and twists the doorknob.  The
door opens with the sound of a braking lock.  Leeloo smiles sweetly and enters
as if nothing were amiss.

	A shriek of joy fills the room.  Korben turns around.  The HOSTESSES
cluster around Loc Rhod as he comes out of the plane.  Loc Rhod spots Korben
and latches onto his arm.  It's not going to be easy to remain discrete.

<b>						LOC RHOD
</b>					(relieved)
				My main man! Please don't leave me here
				alone. My head's killing me and my adoring
				fans are gonna tear me apart! Get me outta
				here!

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				I'll take you to the bar, after that,
				you're on your own.

<b>						LOC RHOD
</b>					(hanging on to Korben)
				Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right,
				man. Tell me all about yourself, your
				roots, your personal life, your childhood
				dreams...

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				I don't think this is a good time...

<b>						LOC RHOD
</b>				...You got brothers and sisters? What
				about your dad? Tell me about your
				dad! What was he like? Physically?
				Big, I suppose?

<b>						KORBEN
</b>					(evasive)
				Yeah, very big, a giant.

<b>						LOC RHOD
</b>				I didn't have a dad... never saw him...
				never even heard him. 50 billion people
				listen to me every day... and he doesn't
				hear me...

<b>159	INT.  SMALL  ROOM  FHLOSTON PARADISE - DAY
</b>
	Leeloo is in a small room, ear at the door, listening. Everything seems
normal. She turns and discovers the room for what it is:	a rest room
for... three cops who look up from their books and stare blankly at her.
Leeloo doesn't know what to do. So she smiles.

	The door opens.  The HOSTESS turns on the light and enters.  Korben
follows her, gaping at all the luxury.

	The BAGGAGE BOY enters bringing Leeloo's two suitcases.

	Korben grabs the notice announcing Diva Plavalaguna's concert at 5:30 in
that evening.  Dress: Formal attire.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				For the concert it says formal attire...
				I didn't bring...

	The hostess pulls back the closet door.  Twenty tuxedos in a row.

<b>						HOSTESS
</b>					(looking him over)
				Here's some champagne. I'll drop by after
				the concert to open it.

	She gives him a blinding smile and closes the door.

	Korben pushes a button.  The curtains open to reveal a most spectacular
view of the turquoise planet.  Stars shoot out into infinity.
Breathtaking.  Korben stands gaping.  The phone rings, snapping him out of
his reverie.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Hello?

</b>				...Ma???

<b>						MOTHER (O.S.)

They hold up a THIRD COP.

<b>						CHIEF OF POLICE
</b>				What happened?
				A bomb go off in your face?

<b>						BEAT-UP COP
</b>				Yeah... A 5 foot 7 inch bomb...

	Cornelius perks up.

<b>						CORNELIUS

				May I speak to you alone.

<b>167	INT.  CORRIDOR  FHLOSTON PARADISE - DAY

	Leeloo watches the Diva's arrival.  A door opens and two POLICEMAN clear
the way for DIVA PLAVALAGUNA, her MANAGER, her BODYGUARDS and a gaggle of
	PORTERS carrying trunks.

	Not wanting to draw attention to herself, Leeloo feigns interest in a
painting that is obviously upside down. A white chiffon veil covers the face
of the Diva, she stops in front of Leeloo.  The Diva reaches out and
strokes Leeloo's face, without touching her. The Diva removes her hand
making a sound of crackling electricity, then passes on.  Leeloo is groggy.
The Diva's ASSISTANT comes up to her.

<b>						DIVA'S ASSISTANT
</b>				Please forgive this little incident. She wants
				you to know that she senses great powers in
				you... in the service of a noble cause... She
				will give you what you have come to get, but

	Korben opens the door.  It's not the champagne.  Even better. It's
Leeloo.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>					(to his mother)
				...I'll call you back.

	Leeloo heads right for her suitcase and starts to undress.  Korben has to
turn away once more.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Here we go again...

<b>						LEELOO
</b>					(by rote)
				You know women normally change five
				times more than men.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				You get that off the screen?

<b>						LEELOO
</b>				Yes... you know there's a lot of
				differences between men women.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				You noticed..

<b>						LEELOO
</b>				OK, you can turn around!

	Korben turns around.  Leeloo has put on a very simple dress which is sexy
to the max.  He is smitten.  So much so that Leeloo wonders if something
isn't quite right.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Where you going?

<b>						LEELOO

</b>				No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite,
				you're... you're beautiful!

	Leeloo smiles at him, his compliment pleases her.  She turns, revealing
her unzippered back.  Korben cannot help but stare at her bare flesh.  Her
perfect bottom.

<b>						LEELOO
</b>				Do you know how this works?

	Korben's blood boils.  She wriggles, pressing her hands together close to
the zipper.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				I have an idea.

	But instead of pulling on the zipper he slips a bracelet on her wrist.  A
flourescent beam bursts out of the bracelet and forms a vertical bar going
from the floor to the ceiling.
	Stunned, Leeloo is held captive.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				I told you I need to work in peace.
				Remember? I need to concentrate.

<b>						LEELOO
</b>				And you can't concentrate with me
				around?.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				It's difficult.

	She tries to breakout.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Army issue. I'm sorry.

	Leeloo tries desperately to get out of the handcuffs. Impossible.

	Korben sets the radio down in front of her and turns it on.
	Leeloo looks like she'd like to break his head.

<b>						LEELOO
</b>					(seething)
				You're nothing but a... a...

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				The words you're looking for weren't
				in the dictionary you studied. I won't
				be long.

	The door flies open.  Loc Rhod barges in.

<b>						LOC RHOD
</b>				Hey Stud we gotta...

	Then he sees the scene, Leeloo cuffed, in a low cut dress.  His mind goes
to the obvious.

<b>						LOC RHOD
</b>				Korben my man what's happening here?
				Who's the chick? What's the gig?
				We free forming here? Getting funky
				with the monkey? Can I get in on this?

	Korben grabs him by the collar..

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				No..to all of the above.

	And yanks Loc Rhod out of the room.  Leaving Leeloo looking extremely
unhappy.

Opera in Paris.  A hostess escorts them to their seats.

<b>						LOC RHOD
</b>					(broadcasting)
				We have just walked into what is probably
				the most beautiful concert hall in the universe.
				Totally awesome! Magnificent paintings on the
				ceiling. I don't know who painted them, but he
				must have busted his balls! I see a row of former
				ministers, more sinister than minister! A few generals
				practicing how to sleep. And there's Baby Ray, star
				of stage and screen, drowning in a sea of nymphets.
				He's not gonna get much out of this concert, he's
				stone-deaf!

<b>	ANGLE ON:
</b>
	Baby Ray bending his ear to a girl asking for an autograph.

<b>						BABY RAY
</b>				...to who?

<b>						LOC RHOD

				...And over there is Roy Von Bacon, the king

	A waiter gives them two glasses of champagne.  Track with the WAITER an
he leaves the hall with his empty tray.  He enters a small room reserved for
staff.

<b>177	INT.  STAFF  ROOM  FHLOSTON  PARADISE - NIGHT
</b>
	The waiter joins some other WAITERS.  They are well armed.  He opens a
cupboard and pulls out a humongous weapon. Suddenly their faces burn off
revealing AKANIT, the young leader of the Mangalores, and his troops.

<b>						AKANIT
</b>				It's showtime!

<b>178	INT.  CONCERT  HALL
</b>
	The lights dim slowly in the concert hall.

	President Lindbergh and his staff, including Munro, sit at the desk.
Speakers appear.

<b>180	INT.  KORBEN'S  SUITE
</b>
	Leeloo, still a prisoner, listens to the concert.

<b>181	INT.  CONCERT  HALL
</b>
	Korben is tense.  The curtain rises.  The Diva, in a stunning gown,
stands in the center of the stage, head bowed.  Behind her, a star filled
window.  The MUSIC begins.  The Diva looks up, a rare beauty, but an alien.
And then she begins to sing.  Her voice is divine, unmatched.  Korben is
swept up in the TEARS.

<b>182	INT.  KORBEN'S  SUITE
</b>
	Leeloo has tears in her eyes

<b>183	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE
</b>
	The manager couldn't care less about the concert.  His main problem is
the bottle of scotch he can't seem to open.  The doorbell RINGS.

<b>						MANAGER
</b>					(ugly mood)
				Yeah!?

<b>						VOICE (O.S.)
</b>				Flowers for the Diva.

<b>						MANAGER
</b>				She's allergic to flowers!!!

<b>						VOICE (O.S.)
</b>				There's champagne as well...

	The manager takes one look at the stubborn bottle and opens the door. And
finds himself staring down the barrel of a gun. A dozen Mangalores rush
in. One of them, with a human face, closes the door and waits out in the hall.

<b>	ANGLE ON:
</b>
	Cornelius watching from around the corner.

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				...My God!

<b>184	INT.  CONTROL  ROOM  FHLOSTON  PARADISE

	Zorg sits at the controls.

<b>						ZORG

				More than enough.

<b>186	EXT.  FHLOSTON  PARADISE - NIGHT

	The ZFX approaches Fhloston.

<b>187	INT.  KORBEN'S  SUITE
</b>
	The ship comes close enough for Leeloo to see it out the window.

<b>	FLASHBACK:
</b>
	The same ships with Mangalores at the controls attack the Mondoshawans at
the beginning of our story.

<b>188	INT.  KORBEN'S  SUITE
</b>
	Leeloo is alarmed.  She has to act.  She seizes the flourescent bar beam
with great effort and rams it into the ceiling, marking a hole large enough
for her to escape.

<b>189	INT.  CLOSET  FHLOSTON  PARADISE
</b>
	Cornelius bursts into the closet he left the Chief of Police tied and
gagged in.  He quickly unties him.

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>					(in a panic)
				Mangalores! The Diva's suite! They want
				the Sacred Stones! They must be stopped.
				We must stop them!. I'm going to free you
				but you must promise to help me!

	The Chief of Police nods his agreement.

<b>190	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE
</b>
	The Mangalores have trashed the suite.  One of the Mangalores finally
finds a case engraved with the four elements.

<b>						MANGALORE
</b>				I have it.

	The Mangalore is about to open the case when... Leeloo descends quietly
and gracefully from the ceiling.  Time stands still.

<b>						LEELOO
</b>				(smiling)
			Apipoulai!

<b>191	INT.  CONCERT  HALL
</b>
	The Diva switches from classical music to funk, picking up the tempo.

<b>	INTERCUT':
</b>
<b>192	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE / CONCERT  HALL.
</b>
	A WARRIOR whips out the biggest knife ever made and rushes Leeloo.  She
disarms him gracefully.  A violent fight breaks out.  The Diva sings and
Leeloo dances.  The Mangalores pay a heavy price for the show.

<b>193	INT.  CORRIDOR
</b>
	Hearing noise from inside the suite, the Mangalore by the door gets
nervous.  He runs for reinforcements.

<b>194	INT.  POLICE  STATION
</b>
	Cornelius enters the police station wearing handcuffs.  The Chief of
Police is behind him holding a gun.

<b>195	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE / CONCERT  HALL
</b>
	Leeloo knocks out the last Mangalore just as the Diva finishes her song
to a burst of applause.  The Diva takes a bow.   So does Leeloo.

<b>196	INT.  ROOM
</b>
	Akanit and his men listen to the concert. The Mangalore guard runs in.

<b>						MANGALORE
</b>				They were waiting for us! It was an
				ambush!

<b>						AKANIT
</b>				If it's war they want it's war they'll get!
				Enact the Final Plan!

	All the Mangalores cock their weapons.

<b>197	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE
</b>
	Leeloo is about to open the case when the door EXPLODES.  Zorg is there
holding a ZF1.

<b>						ZORG
</b>				My compliments, little lady!
				...And thanks for doing all the dirty work!
				I couldn't have done it any better myself!
					(sharply)
				...Now hand over the Stones!

	Leeloo smiles and hands him the case.  Zorg arms the ZF1 and gets ready
to kill her.

<b>						ZORG
</b>				Nice knowing you.

	Leeloo catches on quickly.  She kicks the scotch bottle on the floor into
the gun which throws Zorg's shot off.  She jumps to the ceiling and
disappears in an air vent.  Furious, Zorg fires at the ceiling.

<b>198	INT.	AIRSHAFT
</b>
	Leeloo dodges the bullets as best as she can.

<b>199	INT.  SUITE
</b>
	Zorg fires his 3000 round clip.  The ceiling looks like a piece of swiss
cheese.  Zorg sticks a small cylinder in the wall and flicks it on.  The
numbers flashing by tell us it's a bomb.  The timer reads: 19 minutes and 59
seconds.

<b>						ZORG
</b>					(with a crafty smile)
				You can run but you can't hide...

<b>200	INT.  POLICE  OFFICE  FHLOSTON  PARADISE - NIGHT
</b>
	Cornelius is seated opposite the Chief of Police.  A MEDIC is bandaging
the chief's head.  The door explodes.  The cop outside in riddled with
bullets.  A dozen Mangalores attack the police office.  Akanit is at
their head.  The policemen are caught unaware.

<b>						AKANIT
</b>				Nobody move! We're taking over this
				ship!

	The Chief of Police is goggle-eyed.  Cornelius leans toward him.

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>					(pleased with himself)
				I told you...

<b>201	INT.  CORRIDOR
</b>
	Zorg has the case and exits the suite just as the general alarm goes off.
	He sighs in exasperation.

<b>202	INT.  CONCERT  HALL
</b>
	Three Mangalores suddenly rush into the opera hall shooting.

<b>						MANGALORE 1
</b>				Everyone down!

	There is panic all around.

<b>						LOC RHOD
</b>					(broadcasting, panic stricken)
				Ladies and gentlemen, I think we're being...
				attacked.  The place is crawling with warriors.

<b>203	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE
</b>
	President Lindberg and his generals look very worried.

<b>204	INT.  CONCERT HALL
</b>
	Some security guards open fire one of the Mangalores is hit.  The others
turn their guns on the cops.  People scream, diving for cover.  Korben bides
his time.

	More Mangalores rush in from all around shooting.  Two cops are killed.
	The Diva... takes a bullet.

	She falls from the stage into Korben's arms. He lowers her to the floor.
Korben ignores the panic all around and wraps her in his dinner jacket,
trying to stop the blue blood spurting from her wounds.

<b>205	EXT./ INT.  SPACE  AROUND  FHLOSTON
</b>
	Zorg's ZFX200 speeds away from the boat.  Zorg is at the controls, a
devilish smile on his lips.

<b>						ZORG
</b>				You want something done, do it yourself!

<b>206	INT.  CONCERT  HALL
</b>
	Fighting rages all around in the concert hall, but Korben is oblivious to
it.  He sets the Diva's head delicately on the floor.  Loc Rhod is hidden
nearby, still on the air.

<b>						LOC RHOD
</b>					(voice low, panicked)
				They're hideous. They've got a crest on
				the head, the eyes of a toad and fingers
				all over their hands. Totally hideous!

<b>207	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE.
</b>
<b>						MUNRO
</b>					(worried)
				...Mangalores!

<b>						PRESIDENT
</b>				Send a battalion out immediately!

<b>208	INT.  CONCERT  HALL
</b>
<b>						KORBEN
</b>					(to the Diva)
				I was sent by the government to help you.

<b>						DIVA
</b>				Don't worry.  This is my fate...
				How was the concert?

	Korben is a little surprised, but... the Diva is an artist.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				I've never heard anything so beautiful
				in my life.

	A Mangalore jumps on them from the stage.  Korben makes short work of him
and grabs his gun.

<b>						DIVA
</b>					(weak)
				You're a good man...
				She was right to have chosen you...

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Who?

<b>						DIVA
</b>				The Fifth Element...
				The Supreme Being... Your wife...

	Korben is floored.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Leeloo... is... she's...

<b>						DIVA
</b>				Yes, and more than that... You must
				give her the Stones, she's the only one
				who knows how to use them.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>					(to himself, suddenly
					realizing)
				...So Cornelius was telling the truth!

<b>209	INT.  POLICE  STATION
</b>
	The Mangalores tie up Cornelius and the Chief of Police together.

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>					(to the Chief of Police)
				Of course I was telling you the truth!...
				If you had listened to me in the first place,
				we wouldn't be in this predicament now!

<b>210	INT.  CONCERT  HALL
</b>
	Korben wastes two more Mangalores.

<b>						DIVA
</b>				She needs you. She needs your help and
				your love. She's more fragile than she seems...

	Korben looks around, ready for another attack.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				...Yeah, so am I.

	The Diva takes his hand.

<b>						DIVA
</b>				She was taught to love the life of others...
				but not her own. You have to teach her
				to love if you want her to truly live!

<b>						KORBEN
</b>					(uncomfortable)
				I'll help her, I promise, but I think you
				should tell me where the Stones are!

<b>						DIVA
</b>				Do you love her?

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				I... I don't know! We hardly know
				each other... it takes time!

<b>						DIVA
</b>				I don't have time... I need to know.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman
				I loved her ... I never saw her again.

<b>						DIVA
</b>				I would like to have died in peace...

	The Diva's eyes close.

<b>211	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE
</b>
	The timer on Zorg's bomb clicks over to "15 minutes".

<b>212	INT.  CONCERT  HALL
</b>
<b>						KORBEN
</b>				You tell me to save the world then
				you go off and leave me in the shit!

	He shakes her, gently slapping her cheeks.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Come on! You're not gonna die in peace!
				You're not going to die at all! You hear me?
				Where are the Stones?

<b>213	INT.  SPACESHIP
</b>
	Zorg sets the Sacred Case on a table in the cockpit.  He opens it with a
complacent smile:		It's empty!

	He cannot believe his eyes.  He goes berserk, destroying everything in
sight.

<b>214	INT.  CONCERT  HALL
</b>
	Korben slaps the Diva soundly.  She comes around somewhat.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				I'm sorry, but... the Stones...

<b>						DIVA
</b>					(very weak)
				They are... with me...

	The Diva dies.  Blue blood streams from her mouth.  Korben frisks the
Diva but doesn't find anything.  The shooting slowly stops in the theatre.
The Mangalores are now in total control.

<b>						MANGALORE 2
</b>				Stay calm and nobody will get hurt!
				Hands on your head and into the hall!

	The guests comply

<b>						KORBEN
</b>					(to himself)
				...The Stones are with me?

	and then it occurs to him.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				...In me?

	He touches the Diva's stomach and senses something hard.  Girding
himself, he sticks his hand in the wound and pulls out a Sacred Stone.
Then another.  And another.  Korben pulls out all four Stones, covered in blue
blood.  Everyone has left the theater.  The Mangalores check the aisles one
by one.

	Loc Rhod peeks out from under a seat.

<b>						LOC RHOD
</b>				Don't you think we'd better be going?

	A Mangalore spots Korben kneeling alongside the Diva.  He grabs Korben by
the shoulder and pokes him with his gun.

<b>						MANGALORE
</b>				Hey, you! With the others!

	Korben spins and, in one swift motion, breaks his arm.  Just for
starters.  Another WARRIOR rushes over.  Korben punches him into oblivion
and snatches the gun.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				That's it... I've had... all day people
				have been sticking guns in my face...

	Korben wraps up the four Stones in his shirt.

<b>						LOC RHOD
</b>				Korben man... These dudes are going
				to waste us if we don't do what they say.

	Korben gives him the package and grabs his mike.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				You don't do what I say... I'll waste
				you myself. Got it?

<b>						LOC RHOD
</b>				Got it...

<b>215	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE
</b>
	President Lindberg dabs his sweaty face with a towel.

<b>216	INT.  POLICE  STATION
</b>
	Akanit is still in the police station facing control screens.  He barks
into a
	walkie-talkie.

<b>						AKANIT
</b>				What's the situation in the hall?

<b>217	INT.  HALL
</b>
	Hostages are being gathered in the middle of the hall.  They are
surrounded by Mangalores who guard them.

<b>						MUGGER
</b>					(into walkie-talkie)
				There's no more resistance.
				Everything's under control.

	Three Mangalores are suddenly blasted through the glass door leading to
the theater.  Korben bursts into the hall, two huge guns in his hands.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Everybody down!

	Korben takes out two more WARRIORS coming towards him, rolls behind a
column.
	Laser bullets stinging all around his head.

<b>						LOC RHOD
</b>				This is amazing! Korben, Korben Dallas,
				the winner of the Gemini Croquette
				contest just killed three warriors like he was
				swatting flies...

	Panic everywhere!  Heavy firing fills the hall.

<b>	ANGLE ON:
</b>
	Roy von Bacon, the laserball player, rises from the floor behind a
Mangalore, grabs him and smashes his head into a column, seizing the gun.

<b>	ANGLE ON:
</b>
	Two Mangalores firing a huge machine gun at the column Korben is using
for cover.
	He dives for cover behind the bar.

<b>	ANGLE ON:
</b>
	Two Mangalores watch awestruck.  Roy whistles behind them.  The two
Mangalores turn around.  Roy bonks their heads together.

<b>						LOC RHOD
</b>				It's Roy von Bacon, the Lions center
				forward joining in the battle...

	Someone taps Loc Rhod on the shoulder.  He jumps with fright.

<b>						PRINCESS AACHEN
</b>					(hot to trot)
				All this is terribly exciting, hmmm?

	Loc Rhod covers his mike.

<b>						LOC RHOD
</b><b>				GET OFF MY BACK!
</b>
	A Mangalore shoots in their direction.  Loc Rhod flattens himself on the
floor.  A vase falls on the Princess knocking her out.  A Mangalore loads
some missiles in his gun and destroys the bar piece by piece forcing Korben to
move forward.  Korben motions to Baby Ray hiding under the pool table.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Toss me the balls!

<b>						BABY RAY
</b>					(terrified, still deaf)
				What?

	Another piece of the bar explodes.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				The balls for Christ's sake!

	Korben apes playing pool, but Baby Ray really is stone-deaf.

<b>						EMPEROR JAPHET
</b>				He wants the balls! You deaf or something?

	The EMPEROR rolls the balls over to Korben.  The Mangalore loads more
missiles and shatters another part of the bar.  Korben hides behind the last
bit left.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				How far is he from here?

	The EMPEROR glances at the Mangalore, who in reloading.

<b>						EMPEROR
</b>				I'd say about thirty yards to the left.

	Korben hefts the ball, jumps up and hurls it with blinding  speed.  The
Mangalore catches it right in the head.  He drops, firing in the air.  The
missile strikes the ceiling which collapses on him.  The emperor gives Korben
a thumb's up.

<b>						LOC RHOD
</b>				...And our man Korben has literally
				knocked out the opposition with an
				amazing 90 foot pitch.

	The COPS on the floor rise, scoop up weapons from dead Mangalores and lay
down a line of fire at the last of the fleeing rebels . Roy whirls his arm
in victory.

<b>						FOG
</b>				Thanks for your help.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Forget it.

	Korben grabs Loc Rhod and takes him with him.

<b>218	INT.  KORBEN'S  SUITE

	Korben bursts into the room. He stares at the luminous bar still struck
to the ground and sees the hole Leeloo escaped through.

<b>						KORBEN

policemen already there.

<b>						COP 1
</b>				Hey, who are you?

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				The winner of the Gemini Croquette contest.

	Korben goes to the door and peeks around the corner.  Loc Rhod arrives.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Seven to the left. Five to the right.

<b>						COP
</b>				What's he doing?

	Korben leans around the corner and fires rapidly.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Six to the left. One to the right.

<b>						LOC RHOD

<b>						KORBEN

				We got to find the leader. Mangalores

<b>224	INT.  POLICE  STATION  HALLWAY
</b>
<b>						KORBEN

	Korben gets ready.

<b>						COP 1

<b>225	INT.  POLICE  STATION

	Korben walks quickly into the room, heads straight for Akanit, raises his

				Where'd he learn to negotiate like that?

<b>227	INT.  CONTROL  ROOM

	The police round up the remaining Mangalores.  Korben is at the control
center screens trying to find Leeloo.  Cornelius comes over to him,
embarrassed.

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				You're probably very angry with me and
				I quite understand. But I want you to
				know I'm fighting for a noble cause.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Yeah, I know... to save the world... but
				right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				Leeloo's in trouble?

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				When is she not in trouble?

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite?

	Korben realizes that Cornelius in probably right.

<b>228	INT.  FHLOSTON  PARADISE  LANDING  DOCK  AND  GARAGE

with the bomb stuck on the wall.

	Korben in busy looking for Leeloo.

<b>						KORBEN

				Leeloo?

	Up in the airshaft, Leeloo has heard him.

<b>						LEELOO
</b>				Korben...

	Her voice is too weak, Korben can't hear her.

<b>						LOC RHOD
</b>				Korben man... what the hell is this?

	Korben gives the bomb a prefunctory glance.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				A molecular bomb.

	Three minutes left on the timer.

<b>						LOC RHOD
</b>					(increasingly worried)
				And, uh, what're these numbers clicking
				by?

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				Probably the time remaining before it

	Cornelius smiles and continues his search.

<b>						LOC RHOD
</b>					(weak smile)
				You're just saying that to scare me! Right?
				If it was a bomb, an alarm would've gone off.
				There's bomb detectors in all these hotels!

</b>				Not without Leeloo.

	Loc Rhod cannot take his eyes off the bomb.

<b>						LOC RHOD
</b>				Like D-Man, I hate to bother you but uh,
				like, we're down to 2 minutes here...

	Korben breathes out, bothered.  He turns his attention to the bomb.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				It's the latest model.. I've never seen one
				before... it works off a magnetic coded
				card... Let's see if I can rig it up.

	Leeloo sticks her fingers out one of the bullet holes and lets some of
her blood drip down.

	The blood splats on Korben's hand.  He snaps his head up and knows
immediately who is up there.  He forgets about the bomb.

<b>						LOC RHOD
</b>				Hey! What are you doing? The bomb!

	Korben drags the desk over, jumps on it and pokes his head in the torn up
airshaft He spots Leeloo who gives him a weak smile.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Don't worry, I'm here now!

	He pulls her toward him, helps her out of the shaft and stretches her out
on the desk.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Just relax. I've got the Stones.
				Everything's going to be fine.

	30 seconds left on the timer.

<b>						LOC RHOD

				Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of

<b>						KORBEN

				I'll be right back.

	Korben dashes over to the bomb.  He is stopped by the barrel of the ZF1.
Zorg, in person, holding a magnetic card.

<b>						ZORG

				Allow me...

	Zorg slips a small magnetic card in the bomb, it starts to count down
from 5 minutes.

</b>				Just for the fun of it.

	Loc Rhod faints.

<b>						ZORG
</b>				Well, what do we have here? Is this
				Korben Dallas? The famous winner of
				the Gemini Croquette contest?
				Or is this Korben Dallas from Special

	Korben doesn't reply.

<b>						ZORG
</b>				...In any event, whoever you are,
				I was glad to meet you.

	Zorg fires at Korben who figures he is dead.  Nothing.  Zorg tries again.
Nada.  The clip is empty.  Zorg starts to panic.

<b>						ZORG
</b>				...A 3000 round clip! I didn't fire off
				3000 rounds... did I?

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Don't you know how to count.
				It's not all that hard. Watch!

	Korben punches him square in the face, shows him his index.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				One! That's for trying to kill me!

	Second Punch.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Two! That's for firing me! Three!

	Korben gently wipes Leeloo's forehead with a cloth.  She opens her eyes a
little.

<b>						KORBEN

				Apipoulai..

	Leeloo smiles, weakly, feverish.

<b>						LEELOO
</b>				I'm so very sad.

</b>				Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't

<b>						LEELOO
</b>				Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs...
				Money...
				Everything you create is used to destroy...

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				I told you not to read all that crap!

<b>						LEELOO
</b>				Protect life... Until death.

	Her eyes close and she falls back asleep.  Korben is worried.  She seems
so depressed.  Cornelius enters.

				His name's Mambo, I think.

				So now what's the problem?

	The President drops into his armchair and sighs.

<b>						PRESIDENT
</b>				There's a ball of fire 1,200 miles in diameter
				heading straight for the earth. And we have
				no idea how to stop it! ...That's the problem.

	Korben thinks fast.  The Priest is with him.  The Five Elements are on
board.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				How much time before the collision?

	The President queries the scientist with a nod of the head.

<b>						SCIENTIST
</b>				If its speed remains constant... in an
				hour and 57 minutes.

<b>						KORBEN (O.S.)
</b>				I'll call you back in two hours.

	Korben hangs up.  The President looks stunned.

	The ZFX200 is parked in the middle of the desert.

	Korben walks ahead carrying Leeloo.  Cornelius has the four Stones with
him.
	Barely awake, Loc Rhod stumbles along.  David appears at the door of the
chapel.

<b>						DAVID
</b>				You're all safe. Thanks be to God!

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				Later, David! Later!
				There's not a minute to lose!

	The small group enters the chapel.

	Cornelius pushes the group onto the altar which is surrounded by a wooden
barrier.  Cornelius stands in front of the cross.

lowering the altar like a service elevator.

</b>				About nine minutes.

	President Lindberg has trouble breathing.

<b>265	INT.  TEMPLE
</b>
	Lit by torches, Korben sets Leeloo delicately on the altar in the exact
center of the four elements.  Cornelius looks over the four Stones every
which way.

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>					(panic-stricken)
				Uh, this one... must be water!

	It's obvious he doesn't know where to put it.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Don't tell me you don't know how all
				this works?

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form
				the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed
				to stand in the middle there, but...
				I don't have the reference book.
				I've never seen the Stones work!

	Korben can't believe his ears.  He tears the Stone out of Cornelius' hand
and studies the inscriptions.  He goes over to one of the four bases the
stones rest on and tries to figure it out.  The symbol of air is on the Stone,
the same as on the base.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Match the symbols!

	Korben places the first Stone and picks up another one.  Cornelius has
found the symbol for water.  Loc Rhod sits down.  He is very tired.

<b>						LOC RHOD
</b>				What is this some kinda game? Like
				chess?

	Korben pulls him to his feet and sticks a Stone in his hands.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				No. It's much simpler. If we don't figure
				out where these Stones go in five minutes,
				we're all dead! Think you got it?

	Loc Rhod's got it and runs over to put in his Stone.  The four Stones are
all in place but nothing happens.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				There's no light! You told me there were
				supposed to be four beams of light.

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>					(lost)
				Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut!
				They have to be open for it to work.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				And you don't know how they open,
				is that what you are saying?

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				That's what I'm saying.

<b>266	EXT.  SPACE

	The Dark Planet closes in on Earth rapidly.

	Korben leans over Leeloo.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open
				them! How does it work?

<b>						LEELOO
</b>					(feeble)
				The wind blows... the fire burns...

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking
				about the Stones.

<b>						LEELOO
</b>				...The rain falls...

	Korben is desperate.  Leeloo's too weak, he won't get anything more out
of her.
	He darts over to a Stone and turns it over and over.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				The rain falls... the wind blows?

	Loc Rhod stands in front of his Stone looking at Korben.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Try and figure out how this fucking thing
				opens, instead of staring at me like that!

	Loc Rhod starts feeling the Stone all around.

<b>						LOC RHOD
</b>					(afraid)
				I'm looking, I'm looking.

<b>268	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	The tension is palpable in the President's office.

<b>269	INT.  CHAPEL

	Korben and Cornelius turn the Stones every which way.  All to no avai1.
Loc Rhod is discouraged.

<b>						LOC RHOD
</b>				...we'll never make it.

	He sighs.  Three hooks pop off the Stone.  Loc Rhod can't believe his
eyes.

<b>						LOC RHOD
</b>				It... it moved! Korben! Korben!

	Korben rushes over, looks at the Stone.  Hooks are undone.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				What did you say? What did you do?

<b>						LOC RHOD
</b>				Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do
				nothing!

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Look, you did something that set it off.
				Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me
				exactly what you did!!

	Loc Rhod tries to duplicate the same movement.

<b>						LOC RHOD
</b>				I was like this... With my hands here and...
				I said, "We'll never make it!" That's all!

	Nothing happens.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Is that all?

<b>						LOC RHOD
</b>				Yeah... then I sighed... like this.

	Loc Rhod sighs, really depressed this time.  The Stone opens even more.
	Korben's got it.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				The wind! The wind blows...

	Korben blows on the Stone which immediately opens revealing a patch of
blue sky with some miniature clouds floating around inside.  A yellow beam
pops up like a ray of sunlight, like Korben's smile.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Quickly, everyone on a Stone!
				Water for water!  Fire for fire!
				Earth for earth!

	The two men move fast.  Korben on the 4th Stone: Earth.  He grabs a
fistful of earth  and throws it on the Stone.  A miniature patch of green
appears and immediately forms a green beam.  Cornelius wipes his forehead
with a scarf and wrings it out over the Stone.  It opens revealing a patch of
miniature raging sea.  A blue beam appears.

	Loc Rhod has a problem.

<b>						LOC RHOD
</b>					(shaking)
				I don't have a light.  I stopped smoking
				last week! If we'd come a bit sooner...

	Korben pats his pockets, he comes up with a box of matches.  There's only
one left.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Don't breathe.

	Loc Rhod and Cornelius hold their breath.  Korben strikes the match.  A
small flame appears on the tip.  A breeze goes through the room.  Korben
feels like he's got TNT in his hands.  He approaches the flame to the Stone.
The flame twists, dims, flickers ...but holds on.  The Stone opens.  A patch
of miniature fire appears. Korben sighs, snuffs out the match.  The fourth
beam, a red one, immediately forms.

	A mass of fire fills the screen.  The Earth is only a thousand miles
away.

	Korben helps Leeloo onto her feet where the four beams and four colors
crisscross.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				It's up to you now, Angel!

<b>						LEELOO
</b>				I'm so tired...

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				You can sleep tomorrow... come on...

<b>						LEELOO
</b>				I want to sleep... forever...

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Leeloo! Listen to me! I'll take you on
				a vacation afterwards! A real vacation,
				this time, for as long as you want.
				Come on! You can do it!

	Korben slowly releases Leeloo and steps back from the altar.
	Leeloo can barely stand in the center of the four beams.
	An indistinct white beam begins to form around her, starts to rise.

<b>						CORNELIUS
</b>				Come on Leeloo! Come on!

	The beam loses its intensity.  Leeloo crumples to the floor.

	The heat in the temple is unbearable.  All the walls start to ooze the
same horrible black slimy liquid seen at Zorg's.  A drop of liquid falls to
the temple floor and begins to smoke, eating away at it like acid.  Loc
Rhod has to dodge another drop of the stuff.  Korben quickly straightens
Leeloo up and puts her back in the center of the beams.

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				Leeloo! If you don't get on with the
				program we're all gonna die! And that's
				not on my agenda for today.

	Leeloo wraps her arms around Korben's neck.

<b>						LEELOO
</b>					(weak)
				What's the use of saving lives...

<b>						KORBEN
</b>				You're right but there are lots of good

<b>						LEELOO
</b>				...Like love...

<b>						KORBEN

rips if off.

around Leeloo and Korben. - The stopwatch hits zero.  - The Absolute Beam
explodes from the top of the pyramid and heads straight into the sky zapping
the fireball smack in the middle, slowing it down.  - Korben and Leeloo kiss
like there was no tomorrow.

	- The beam hardens and slowly solidifies the Evil Planet.  Inaudible
screeches escape from the dying planet.  Screeches of terrifying pain as if a
million souls were dying.

	- Streams of black acid spurt from the pyramid and solidify like
brilliant stalactites.

	In the temple, the beam loses its intensity.  But Leeloo and Korben
remain stuck together, lost in their kiss.  Cornelius has dropped to his
knees, clutching his hands.

smile.

	Mactilburgh goes to the reactor and opens a small slot which allows him
to see what is going on under the blue shield.

	Leeloo and Korben are naked, arms wrapped around each other, kissing and
probably engaged in hoppi hoppa.
	Mactilburgh looks troubled.
