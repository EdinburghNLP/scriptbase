</b><b>FADE IN:
</b>

<b>EXT. UNION STATION, WASHINGTON, D.C. DAY
</b><b>LONG SHOT THE CAPITOL DOME IN THE B.G. AND THE AUTOMOBILE
</b><b>ENTRANCE TO THE STATION IN THE F.G. LOW CAMERA
</b>
Activity of cars and taxis arriving and discharging passengers
with luggage, busy redcaps, etcetera.

We FOCUS on a taxi pulling up and stopping, The driver hands
out modest looking luggage, including a bunch of tennis
rackets in cases to a redcap. CAMERA PANS DOWN as the
passenger gets out of the taxi so that we see only his shoes
and the lower part of his trousers. He is wearing dark
colored brogues and a conservative suit apparently. The
feet move toward, the entrance to the station and out of
scene. Immediately a chauffeur-driven limousine drives up
and an expensive place of airplane luggage is handed out of
this, and the passenger alighting from the back is seen to
be wearing black and white sport shoes which, as before, are
all we see of him. The sport shoes start off in the wake of
the brogues.


<b>INT. STATION LOBBY
</b>
CAMERA FOLLOWS the sport shoes and the brogues across the
lobby into a passenger tunnel. There is the usual activity
of passengers walking to and from, a loud-speaker announcing
trains, etc.


<b>EXT. PASSENGER TUNNEL
</b>
As the brogues and the sport shoes emerge to the train
platform, CAMERA PANS them over to the steps of the train.


<b>INT. TRAIN
</b>
The brogues and the sport shoes pass separately down the
aisle, the sport shoes turning in at a compartment door and
the brogues continuing toward the parlor car.

<b>                                                DISSOLVE TO:
</b>

<b>INT. PARLOR CAR (PROCESS)
</b>
The brogues come to rest before a chair as the owner sits
down. A moment later the sport shoes come to rest. before
in adjoining chair.

The legs belonging to the sport shoes stretch out, and one
of the shoes touches one of the brogues.

                      MAN'S VOICE (over scene)
          Oh, excuse Me!

CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP to SHOW two young men seated in two
parlor car chairs. BRUN0 ANTHONY, the wearer of the sport
shoes, is about twenty-five. He wears his expensive clothes
with the tweedy nonchalance of a young man who has always
had the best. The wearer of the brogues is a fine looking
but, at the moment, a somewhat troubled young man. This is
GUY HAINES. He, too, is in his middle twenties and is well
dressed because he can now afford to be. He nods politely,
acknowledging Bruno's apology, then turns away with the
gesture implying he wants privacy.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>              (smiling with sudden
               recognition)
          I beg your pardon, but aren't you
          Guy Haines.

Guy nods with a polite half smile. Being a well known
tournament tennis player, he has had this sort of experience
before.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>              (snapping his finger)
          Sure! I saw you blast Faraday right
          off the court in South Orange last
          season. What a backhand! Made the
          semi-finals, didn't you?

Guy acknowledges this with a modest nod and turns to his
magazine rolled up in is fist.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>              (with open admiration)
          I certainly admire people who do
          things.
              (smiling and
               introducing himself)
          I'm Bruno Anthony. Bruno. See Guy
          looks up. Bruno indicates his gold
          tie pin which bears his name in cut-
          out letters. Guy looks at it with
          the faintest expression of disdain.
          I suppose you think it's corny. But
          my mother gave it to me so of course
          I wear it to please her.

<b>                      GUY
</b>              (patiently)(a faint
               smile)
          How do you do.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>              (with an apologetic
               grin)
          I don't usually talk so much.   Go
          Ahead and read.

<b>                        GUY
</b>              (wryly)
          Thanks.
Guy tries to read but is uneasily aware of Bruno's open
appraisal.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>          It must be pretty exciting to be so
          important.

<b>                      GUY
</b>              (fidgeting slightly)
          A tennis player isn't so important.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>          People who do things are important.
          I never seem to do anything.

Not knowing how to answer this, Guy looks a little
embarrassed.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>              (still insistent on
               being friendly)
          I suppose you're going to Southampton --
          for the doubles.

<b>                      GUY
</b>              (politely)
          You are a tennis fan.

Bruno is inordinately pleased by this small tribute.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>          Wish I could see you play. But I've
          got to be back in Washington tomorrow.
          I live in Arlington, you know.

He has taken out a cigarette case.   Holds it out to Guy.

<b>                               BRUNO
</b>             Cigarette?

<b>                         GUY
</b>             Not now, thanks.          I don't smoke much.

<b>                         BRUNO
</b>             I smoke too much.

He fumbles for a match.          Guy brings out a lighter and hands
it to Bruno.

<b>                         BRUNO
</b>             Thanks.
                 (he stares at the
                  lighter, impressed)
             Elegant.


<b>CLOSE SHOT OF THE LIGHTER
</b>
Showing that it has the insignia of crossed rackets embossed
on it, and underneath is engraved the inscription: "To G
from A".

</b>                 (reading)
             To G from A. Bet I can guess who A
             is.


<b>WIDER SHOT
</b>
Guy reacts sharply.

<b>                               GUY
</b>                    (coldly)
             Yes?

<b>                         BRUNO
</b>             Anne Burton. Sometimes I turn the
             sport page and look at the society
             news. And the pictures. She's very
             beautiful, Senator Burton's daughter.

<b>                         GUY
</b>             You're quite a reader, Mr. Anthony.

<b>                         BRUNO
</b>             Yes, I am. Ask me anything, from
             today's stock reports to Li'l Abner,
             and I got the answer.

<b>                      BRUNO (CONT'D)
</b>          Even news about people I don't know.
          Like who'd like to marry whom when
          his wife gets her divorce.

<b>                      GUY
</b>              (sharply)
          Perhaps you read too much.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>              (contritely)
          There I go again. Too friendly. I
          meet someone I' like and open my yap
          too wide. I'm sorry...
At the appeal on Bruno's face, Guy slowly relents.

<b>                      GUY
</b>          That's all right. Forget it.    I
          guess I'm pretty jumpy.

Bruno smiles with and signals a waiter.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>          There's a new cure for that.
              (to waiter)
          Scotch and plain water. A pair.
          Double.
              (to Guy with a chuckle)
          Only kind of doubles I play.

<b>                      GUY
</b>          You'll have to drink both of them.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>              (grinning)
          And I can do it.
              (moving in)
          When's the wedding?

<b>                      GUY
</b>          What?

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>          The wedding. You and Anne Burton.
              (a gesture of
               explanation)
          It was in the papers.

<b>                      GUY
</b>          It shouldn't have been. Unless
          they've legalized bigamy overnight.

<b>                     BRUNO
</b>         I have a theory about that. I'd
         like to tell you about it some time.
         But right now I suppose divorce Is
         still the simplest operation.

The waiter has brought the drinks. Bruno slips the lighter
into hip pocket to free his hands for the bills which he
gives to the waiter, waving away the change. He offers a
glass to Guy. Guy takes it.

<b>                     GUY
</b>             (as if he needs it)
         I guess I will.
<b>                     BRUNO
</b>             (happily)
         This is wonderful -- having your
         company all the way to New York.

<b>                     GUY
</b>             (forced to explain)
         As a matter of fact, I'm not going
         direct. I'm stopping off. At
         Metcalf.

<b>INT. BRUNO'S COMPARTMENT ON TRAIN (PROCESS)
</b>
Bruno and Guy are finishing lunch. Bruno has been drinking
and his eyes are bright and feverish. An almost empty liquor
bottle is near a couple of detective novels covered with
gaudily Illustrated dust jackets. Bruno has in unlighted
cigarette in his mouth. Guy's lighter is on the table.
Bruno snaps it a couple of times, as though fascinated, lights
his cigarette and puts the lighter on the table again.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>          Sure, I went to college. Three of
          them. Every time they kicked me out
          my father threw me back in.
              (bitterly)
          He finally gave up. He thinks I'm
          awfully small fry, not worth the
          bait.
              (wistfully)
          You my friend, Guy?

<b>                       GUY
</b>          Sure.   I'm your friend, Bruno.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>              (a little woozy)
          No, you're not, nobody thinks I'm
          anything special. Only my mother.
              (empties the bottle
               into his glass)
          My father hates me.

Guy smiles this off as nonsense.

<b>                      GUY
</b>          You must be imagining things.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>              (hitting the bottom
               of the bottle for
               the last drop)
          And I hate him. He thinks   I ought
          to catch the eight-five bus  every
          morning, punch a timeclock  and work
          my way up selling paint or  something.
          Him -- with all his money!

<b>                      GUY

          Well, what do you want to do?

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>          You mean before or after I kill him?

   Before, of course.

<b>               BRUNO
</b>       (leaning forward
        eagerly)
   I want to do everything. I got a
   theory you're supposed to do
   everything before you die. Have you
   ever driven a car, blindfolded, at a
   hundred and fifty miles an hour?

<b>                 GUY
</b>   Not lately.
<b>               BRUNO

<b>               GUY
</b>       (amused and curious)
   What are you trying prove?

<b>               BRUNO
</b>   I'm not like you, Guy. You're lucky.
   You're smart. Marrying the boss's
   daughter is a nice short cut to a
   career, isn't it?

<b>               GUY
</b>       (quickly)
   Marrying the senator's daughter has
   nothing to do with it. Can't a fellow
   look past a tennis not without being
   a goldbricker?

<b>               BRUNO
</b>   Take it easy, boy. I'm your friend,
   remember? I'd do anything for you.

<b>                BRUNO
</b>    But not against the law of nature.
    My theory is that everybody is a
    potential murderer. Didn't you ever
    want to kill somebody? Say one of
    those useless fellows Miriam was
    running around with?

<b>                GUY
</b>    You can't go around killing people
    just because you think they're
    useless.

<b>                BRUNO
</b>    Oh, what's a life or two? Some people
    are bitter off dead, Guy. Take your --
    wife and my father, for instance.
    It reminds me of a wonderful idea
    had once. I used to put myself to
    sleep at night -- figuring it out.
    Now, let's say you want to get rid
    of your wife.

<b>                GUY
</b>    Why?

<b>                BRUNO
</b>    Let's say she refuses to give you a
    divorce --
        (raises a finger and
         stops Guy's protest)
    Let's say. You'd be afraid to kill
    her because you'd get caught. And
    what would trip you up? Motive.
    Now here's the plan...

<b>                GUY
</b>    I'm afraid I haven't time to listen.

<b>                BRUNO
</b>        (ignoring the remark)
    It's so simple, too. A couple of
    fellows meet accidentally, like you
    and me. No connection between them
    at all. Never saw each other before.
    Each of them has somebody he'd like
    to get rid of, but he can't murder
    the person he wants to get rid of.
    He'll get caught. So they swap
    murders.

<b>                GUY
</b>    Swap murders?

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>          Each fellow does the other fellow's
          murder. Then there is nothing to
          connect them. The one who had the
          motive isn't there. Each fellow
          murders a total stranger. Like you
          do my murder and I do yours.

<b>                      GUY

<b>                      MIRIAM
</b>          But people don't know that, Guy, do
          they? It would make a pretty story,
          wouldn't it -- the senator's daughter
          involved with a married man who's
          about to become a father.

A few people in the shop look around as Guy's voice rises
above the sound of the record playing.

</b>          Keep your voice down.

<b>                      GUY

<b>                       MIRIAM
</b>              (demurely)
          I could be very pathetic as the
          deserted little mother in a courtroom,
          Guy. Think it over. Who would
          believe you?

Guy seizes her angrily and in so doing, knocks the tone arm
across the record with a loud screech. From outside we can
see heads turn. Mr. Hargreaves, the manager, is very
disturbed.


<b>MED. SHOT THROUGH GLASS PARTITION FROM HARGREAVES' VIEWPOINT
</b>We see Guy gripping Miriam's arms and apparently addressing
her in a threatening manner, although we do not hear his
words. The smile has faded from Miriam's face and something
like cringing fear has taken its place. She is drawn and
tense and seems to cower beneath Guy's rage.

Mr. Hargreaves moves forward and opens Guy's tirade.

<b>                      GUY
</b>          ...That's what should happen to people
          like you. And if I...

          place for a family quarrel.

<b>                      GUY
</b>              (his eyes blazing)
          Sorry. I'm leaving.

He starts to exit from the booth.   Miriam grabs his arm and
screams at him:

<b>                      MIRIAM
</b>              (yelling like a
               fishwife)
          You heard what I said, Guy Haines.
          You can't throw me away like an old
          shoe. I'm coming to Washington to
          have my baby. Tell that to the
          senate!

Guy strides out of the store, the manager and a few customers
turning around in surprise.

The two customers in other booths, seeing the quarrel, open
their doors simultaneously and Miriam's tirade is climaxed
by a cacophony of noise, a big symphony, loud hot music, and
the apparently unaware piano tuner.


<b>EXT. MAIN STREET METCALF SHOOTING TOWARDS STATION
</b>
Guy is striding along angrily. He comes to the same
intersection and the same cop. The officer makes a friendly
gesture, is if he'd like to talk awhile, but Guy strides
past him without noticing.


<b>EXT. METCALF STATION (PROCESS)
</b>Guy comes into the scene, crosses to a row of public telephone
booths, enters one. Inside the telephone booth, he dumps
some loose change on the shelf, sticks a nickel in the
telephone, speaks into it.

<b>                      GUY
</b>          Long distance.
              (a pause)
          I want Washington, D. C. The number
          is Republic 0800. Person to person.
          Miss Anne Burton.

Another pause, very long. Guy is very restless. He digs a
cigarette out of his pocket and sticks it in his mouth, then
looks through his pockets for his lighter, doesn't find it.
He looks puzzled, but about that time the operator speaks to
him.

<b>                      GUY
</b>              (continuing)
          Right.

Guy picks coins up off the shelf and drops them into the
telephone, then waits. He shifts the receiver and fumbles
in his other jacket pocket, then turns to the phone.

ANNE BURTON is a beautiful, high-spirited and well-bred young
woman. The smile on her face his faded to anxiety as she
listens over the telephone which is on the desk.

          do that to you, Guy -- it's
          unbelievable -- it's, it's evil!
              (she listens, then
               calmly)
          Yes, I know how you must feel.

          What's that?

Meantime the noise of a through train has been HEARD, and
the horn on a streamliner locomotive. It has come up very
fast, it is now almost to the station. Guy rises his voice
and yells into the telephone. His voice fights the roar of
the train:

<b>                      GUY

</b>
The expression on his face is frenzied and suggesting that
he means exactly what he is saying.

<b>INT. ANTHONY LIVING ROOM
</b>
The scene opens on a CLOSEUP OF A MAN'S HANDS. One of them
is semi-flexed and turning slowly, The other is receiving
the final touches of a manicure.

CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal that these are Bruno's hands,
and that, he is studying them moodily, CAMERA PULLS BACK
FARTHER to reveal his mother, MRS. ANTHONY, sitting opposite
him at a little table in the Anthony living room. She is
working with scissors, file and nail buffer. Mrs. Anthony
is a gentle, once pretty woman, whose pastel exterior harbors
a tigress-like determination to protect her son, Bruno is in
his robe and is unshaven.
There is evidence of long established wealth in the heavy
dark appointments of this room.

<b>                      MRS. ANTHONY
</b>          Since you insisted on a manicure,
          dear, I do wish you'd keep your hands
          quiet. You're so restless lately.

               hand)

Mrs. Anthony looks up, notices his moody expression.

<b>                      MRS. ANTHONY
</b>          Did I file them too short?

<b>                       BRUNO

          But you have that 'look'. I can
          always tell. You haven't got into
          any more mischief, Bruno?

He denies this with a slow, solemn shake of his head.

</b>          I do hope you've forgotten about
          that silly little plan of yours?

              (she rises)
          Now get shaved, dear, before your
          father gets home.

Bruno's fist crashes down on the little table, upsetting it,
as he gets to his feet.

The painting is a horrible mess. Out of the violence of the
pattern a man's face can be discerned, wild-eyed and
distorted. We hear laughter from Bruno.


<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>
Bruno's roar of laughter puzzles Mrs. Anthony, but she is
pleased to hear his good humor. He puts an arm around her.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>          You're wonderful, Ma! It's the old

          It is? I was trying to paint Saint
          Francis.

At this moment there is the sound of the front door opening.
Then immediately the telephone bell rings in the hall. Bruno
is instantly alert, as if he had been expecting a call. He
goes toward the door to the hall, as the butler enters.

<b>                      BUTLER
</b>              (to Bruno)
          They are ready with your call to

Bruno's father MR. ANTHONY, purposefully enters the living
room. He an impeccably dressed business man with an
uncompromising eye. His entrance momentarily blocks Bruno's
exit.

speaking.

dispute as Bruno listens at phone:

          So she double-crossed you!   Are you

The phone clicks in Bruno's ear. He looks hurt for an

father off scene and his expression becomes more enigmatic.

Bruno looks off in direction of his farther's voice with an
expression which says, "Crow while you can, you haven't

cigarette lighter and as he flicks it on and off.

Bruno turns to follow Miriam, his manner casual. As he takes
a few steps, WE PAN ACROSS with him until, over his shoulder,
we see a merry-go-round in the background. Miriam and the
two boys are aboard and climbing onto horses. As Bruno goes
toward the merry-go-round, the CAMERA MOVES UP A LITTLE with
him. The merry-go-round starts to move slowly round as Bruno
hops on.

Bruno begins to look around for Miriam, who is apparently on
the other side of the merry-go-round. He starts to thread
his way through the horses which are beginning to move up

the oncoming heads before he reaches Miriam. She is on an
outside mount which is high in the air when she sees Bruno
facing her. Her laughter dies for a moment and she smiles

behind her, Miriam glancing at him as her horse comes down.

Bruno is approaching the pay box.


<b>MEDIUM SHOT
</b>
Miriam and her companions are escorted to a small boat with
electric motor. Once they are seated the boat chugs away
from the landing stage and off into the darkness.

Bruno steps into the foreground and gets into the next boat
which floats alongside. He, too, moves away into the
darkness.

<b>ENTRANCE TO THE TUNNEL
</b>
As Miriam's boat passes through, she gives another little
glance over shoulder before her boat disappears into the
darkness of the tunnel.

After a brief moment Bruno's boat comes into the picture,
and it, too, goes into the tunnel.


<b>INSIDE THE TUNNEL
</b>
We see the silhouettes of the occupants of Miriam's boat on
the wall of the tunnel, lit dimly from the light coming from
the tunnel exit.

The silhouette of Bruno in his boat, lit by the tunnel
entrance, gradually approaches the other three. When the
silhouettes are almost touching, we --

It is empty. There is a sudden piercing scream from inside,
followed after a second or two by protestations and giggling
as Miriam's boat emerges into the light. She is pushing one
of the boys away from her.

<b>MEDIUM SHOT ISLAND
</b>
The group of Miriam and her companions are scrambling out of
their boat and moving onto the island, one of the boys trying
the boat on the shore. They disappear into the Woods of the
island.

Again Bruno's boat comes into the picture. He steps out,
lift the prow of the boat a little onto the shore.


<b>LONG SHOT ISLAND
</b>
We see the amusement park lighted beyond the lake.
Silhouetted in the foreground, the trees and foliage of the
island. Nearby we see the silhouetted figures of Miriam and
her companions move across the scene, right to left. Miriam
is pushing George away from her.

She backs away from him and the boys go on picture. Miriam
goes in another direction, around, the bushes. George
obviously misses her, for we hear his voice call out:

<b>                      GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>          Miriam!

Miriam backs out of the bushes   until the back of her head is
in CLOSEUP in the foreground of   the shot. Suddenly she hears
steps in back of her and turns   her head toward CAMERA. Her
face changes as she recognizes   someone offscene.

She gives a coy smile of recognition. CAMERA   PULLS BACK to
reveal the mad and shoulders of Bruno between  Miriam and the
camera. His hand holds Guy's lighter which he   flicks on as
he raises it above Miriam's face. 0f Bruno, we  see only the
back of his head and shoulders.

We see Bruno's gloved hands dart quickly to Miriam's throat.
The lighter falls down out of picture, and as Bruno's hands
grip her throat, his head moves slightly to blot out Miriam's
face. His head moves a bit farther until Miriam's face is
nearly uncovered at the other side of the screen, and we see
her glasses fall off.


<b>CLOSE SHOT

Miriam's glasses hit the ground. The shadows of their
struggling figures over the shot.


<b>CLOSE UP
</b>The screen is filled with one of the lenses  of the glasses.
They are of the diminishing type. Against   the moonlit sky
we see reflected, the elongated struggling  figures, as though
we were shooting up at them. Suddenly one   of the figures
falls forward.


<b>CLOSE UP

Miriam's head drops into the picture by the glasses.

Bruno's hand comes into the picture and picks up the glasses.
One of the lenses has been broken by Miriam's fall.

As we see Bruno's sport shoes move away, the CAMERA MOVES
PAST MIRIAM'S HEAD until it comes to Guy's lighter pressed
into the earth.

Bruno glances back over his shoulder.   He looks down and
goes back one or two steps.

Bruno comes to the shore where his boat is moored. He gets

fact and not furtively.

There are two boats unloading. Bruno's boat is approaching.
We hear a loud call from the island. Someone has found
Miriam.

</b>          Hey, here she is! What's the matter
          with her? Has she fainted?

More shouts from the island cause the people at the landing
stage to look back.  The boatman's attention is also
attracted. Suddenly,  as Bruno is getting out of boat, there
is a loud scream from the island.

<b>                       VOICE
</b>              (crying out)

          Help! Help!

Bruno by this time has stopped onto the landing stage, and
in company with the other people, is looking back as if to
see what's wrong on the island. Then he moves away, starting
off of the landing stage. The boatman turns and glances at
Bruno, but quickly returns his attention to the disturbance
across on the island. He hurries forward and with a couple
of men passengers jumps into one of the boats. He calls to
his assistant as he gets into the boat.

<b>MEDIUM SHOT BRUNO

As Bruno calmly threads his way along the midway, we hear
above the noise of the various concessions, a shrill police
whistle in the distance. Presently a couple of policemen
comes running from direction of the main entrance and past
Bruno. He glances at them over his shoulder, then strolls
on toward the main entrance to the park.

<b>ENTRANCE TO AMUSEMENT PARK EXTERIOR
</b>
As Bruno comes out through the turnstile, he stands for a
moment on the street. At this moment a man hesitates at the
curbstone. He is blind and tapping the sidewalk with his
white cane. He takes one step into the roadway, then
hesitates. Bruno steps forward and takes the blind man's
arm. CAMERA PULLS BACK as Bruno escorts the blind man across
the road. With a sweeping gesture he holds back a couple of
cars to lot them pass.

Once on the other side of the road, the blind man utters his
thanks.

Guy still stares across the street.

<b>CLOSEUP GUY
</b>
He looks across at the police, then down at himself with
some surprise and disgust, then over at Bruno, suddenly
conscious he is behaving like a criminal and that Bruno is
responsible for his predicament.

Bruno for a moment looks menacingly at Guy.

<b>                       BRUNO
</b>           Don't you call me that.

Bruno's flare of anger dies.   They both look again across
the street.

He goes in and slams the door in Bruno's face.

          But we have to --

He realizes there is no use in trying to talk to Guy any
further. He turns and faces the CAMERA IN CLOSE UP as he
moves away, looking sad almost to the point of tears.


<b>INT. GUY'S APARTMENT
</b>
Guy is standing at the telephone which is still ringing. He
has Miriam's glasses in his hand. He looks down at them for
a moment, then picks up the receiver. He hesitates, then
speaks into the phone.

He starts to dial, then suddenly hangs up and starts out.

A taxi drives up and stops in front of a handsome residence.
It is the Burton home. Guy gets out of the taxi and goes up
the steps.


<b>MED. SHOT OVER GUY'S SHOULDER
</b>
His figure tense, he rings the   bell. After a moment's wait,
the door is opened from inside   and Anne Burton stands in the
lighted hallway. She looks at    Guy with an anxious, taut
expression, searches his face   hastily, then as he takes a
step inside she is suddenly in   his arms. They embrace with
wordless fervor.

<b>                      GUY
</b>              (holding her close)

an answer to some question in her mind.

Father wants to see you.


<b>CLOSEUP GUY
</b>
He looks apprehensively in direction of the living room,
conscious of what the news is to be, but covering up.

<b>LONG SHOT LIVING ROOM FROM GUY'S VIEWPOINT
</b>
SENATOR BURTON and BARBARA BURTON are seated near a desk on
the farthest side of the room. Senator Burton is a
distinguished fifty, a man with great pride in tradition,
his family and his career. Barbara, Anne's younger sister,
is a lively seventeen who loves excitement, says exactly
what she thinks and rarely thinks before she says it.
Superficially, in height and figure, she resembles Miriam.
She also weirs glasses. By her gestures we gather she is
speaking urgently, but softly, to her father, who lifts a
weary hand to quiet her as she looks toward Guy in the
hallway, Barbara keeps quiet and also looks toward Guy.
They both wait for him to enter.


<b>CLOSEUP GUY
</b>
He steels himself for the long walk across the hall and the
living room.


<b>CLOSEUP ANNE
</b>
Watching Guy closely.


<b>MED. SHOT

As Guy starts to make the long trek across the living room,
with Anne behind him --

<b>                        GUY
</b>                (stiffly)

Barbara has been squirming in her seat, then as if jet
propelled she catapults out of it and runs to Guy, giving
him a big hug and a smack on the cheek.

<b>                      BARBARA
</b>          Something awful has happened, Guy.

<b>                       SENATOR
</b>              (firmly)
          Sit down, Barbara.

Subdued, she sits down.   But Guy remains standing.

<b>                      SENATOR
</b>              (finding it difficult
               to begin)
          There seems to be no way of
          diplomatically breaking tragic news.
          I'm sorry, Guy, to be the one to
          tell you. It concerns your wife.
          She's been murdered.

Guy stares woodenly at the Senator, is if hypnotized.

<b>                      BARBARA
</b>          The police have been using everything
          but radar to locate you.

<b>                      SENATOR
</b>          You're to call Headquarters at
          Metcalf.

The full impact of what has happened hits Guy once more.

<b>                      GUY
</b>          Miriam...murdered.

<b>                      ANNE
</b>              (with inner tension)
          She was...strangled.

Slowly Guy's eyes meet hers. They are remembering what he
said on the phone: "I could strangle her." He sinks into a
chair. The Senator is quite distressed.

During the following scene Barbara quietly goes about the
business of pouring drinks and serving them. She knows
everyone's preference.

<b>                SENATOR
</b>        (wrylt, to Guy)
    It happened on an island in an
    amusement park. It was sort of a
    lovers lane, I believe. A rather
    sordid atmosphere.

<b>                BARBARA
</b>        (quickly, to Guy)
    Miriam went there with two boys.
    They were the ones who found her.
    So they're not suspects. But you
    probably will be.

<b>                 SENATOR
</b>    Young lady, we can't overlook the
    fact that murder is at our doorsteps.
    But I forbid you to drag it into the
    living room!

<b>                BARBARA
</b>        (wide-eyed)
    Let's not fool ourselves. The police
    will say Guy wanted Miriam out of
    the way so he could marry Anne. In
    a crime of this sort the police first
    go after the husband, and Guy had
    every motive.

<b>                   SENATOR
</b>        (aghast)
    Motive?

<b>                GUY
</b>        (quietly)
    She's right. Whichever way you look
    at it...I'm in a spot.

<b>                SENATOR
</b>        (disconcerted but
         whistling in dark)
    Oh come now, my boy. I'm sure you
    have nothing to worry about.

<b>                 BARBARA

He looks about him uncomfortably, then turns suddenly as he

Seated behind Guy, apart from the others who are waiting, is
Professor Collins, Guy's drunken companion on the train of
the night before. The professor is completely sober now,
dignified and erect. He has removed his glasses to polish
them and does not react to Guy's presence.


<b>CLOSEUP GUY
</b>
Guy starts with a smile of recognition to say, "How do you
do?" but at that moment he hears the door open and his name
called:

</b>            Will you come in, please, Mr. Haines?


<b>MED. SHOT

Guy breaks away from his uncompleted greeting to the professor
and goes through the door to Captain Turley's office, followed
by the eyes of the waiting people.

<b>INT. CAPTAIN TURLEY'S OFFICE
</b>
CAPTAIN TURLEY is conscientious, methodical and always polite.
He puts aside photographs and records and rises from behind
his desk as Guy comes in. A detective lieutenant, CAMPBELL,
is attending a coffee maker. Their expressions are grave by
contrast with Guy's confident attitude after seeing the
professor in the waiting room.

<b>                        CAPTAIN TURLEY

Turley signals to Campbell to call the professor in.

Momentarily Guy is frustrated, then he turns quietly to
Turley.

<b>                      GUY
</b>              (calmly, logically)
          Captain, is it so important whether
          or not Professor Collins remember
          me? Surely, the important thing is
          that I've been able to name a man
          who was on the train with me. You've
          been able to find him. Isn't that
          proof of where I was at nine-thirty
          last night?
Guy asks this question with a look of near triumph that he
has clearly established his alibi.

The Burtons are having coffee. Barbara has been glancing
through a new murder mystery with a lurid cover. As Guy

</b>    Completely.    He didn't remember me.

<b>                ANNE
</b>    But, you knew he was on the train!
    Wasn't that enough to prove you were
    on it, too?

<b>                GUY
</b>    Apparently not at the right time.
    They suggested I could have caught
    the train at Baltimore after Miriam

turns back to the others.

confident of his own prestige as he goes back to his coffee.

Guy has been looking at Anne and is concerned at the worry
on her face. He nods in assent to the Senator's suggestion,
but puts his hand over Anne's.

about a casual stranger.

<b>FADE IN
</b><b>INT. MORTON STUDY MED. SHOT
</b>
Guy and a secretary have set up office in the Morton study.
As the scene opens the secretary is handing Guy a large
envelope.

<b>                      SECRETARY
</b>          Here's a special delivery, Mr. Haines.
          It's marked personal.

As Guy is opening the envelope, Barbara speaks to him from
atop a library ladder. She is getting a book from one of
the top shelves of a bookcase, which is next to a window.
<b>                      BARBARA
</b>          Are you getting in any practice today,
          Guy?

                large folded sheet
                of paper and glances
                at it, mystified)
          Yes, if I can get a court at the
          club.

As Guy's hands unfold the paper and hold it for moment, we
see that it is a diagrammed plan of the grounds and the
Interior of the Anthony house. There are dotted lines along
the upper hall, with an arrow which points to one room and
where Bruno has indicated in his handwriting, "My father's
room." Over this we hear the voices of Barbara and the
secretary:

<b>                      SECRETARY'S VOICE
</b>          Barbara, who are you waving at?

<b>                       BARBARA'S VOICE
</b>          Mr. Hennessy. I think it is a shame
          Daddy won't let us have him in the
          house to sit down. Have you met him
          yet, Louise?

<b>                      SECRETARY'S VOICE
</b>          No.

Guy appears, carrying his racquets. His partner for the
forthcoming game, and one or two other players, are close
by.

awkwardly or avoiding his eyes. He moves self-consciously

The heads of the people in the bleachers move from side to
side, to follow the play on the court. One head is not
moving. It is staring at Guy. It is Bruno.

At this moment, we hear the umpire calling, "Game, set and
match" to the winning mixed doubles pair.


<b>CLOSEUP GUY
</b>
His expression becomes set.


<b>LONG SHOT
</b>
The mixed doubles couples complete their handshaking at the
net and move off the court. We see Guy move up to the base
line while the other player takes his position for the
preliminary knock-up.

As Guy casually knocks the ball across the net, he glances
again toward Bruno.

He hears his opponent's voice.

Guy shakes off his abstraction and poises himself to receive

the name "Bruno" is resting on the edge of the table.

          about? You know, the one where the

               Dear Guy --

               Just two more days left. We must

Guy turns to the dresser drawer in which he has put the note
and the gun, maneuvering his body between the dresser and
Hennessy's view. He takes out a handkerchief, closes the
drawer, sticks the handkerchief in his pocket, speaking as
he does so.

          sentenced a man to the chair, isn't
          it difficult to go and eat your dinner
          after that?

<b>                      JUDGE
</b>          Young man, when a murderer is caught,
          he must be tried. When he is
          convicted, he must be sentenced.
          When he is sentenced to death, he
          must be executed.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>          Quite impersonal, isn't it, sir?

<b>                     JUDGE
</b>          So it is. Besides, it doesn't happen
          every day.

At this moment, Anne comes into the scene.    She hesitates as
she hears Bruno's answer.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>          So few murderers are caught.

The Judge moves out of the way. Bruno smiles blandly at the
ladies. One of them speaks to him.

<b>                      MRS. CUNNINGHAM
</b>          Well, Mr. Antony, you seem very
          interested in the subject of murder.

Anne looks more troubled, then moves on out of the scene.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>          No more than anyone else.   No more
          than you, for instance.

<b>                       MRS. CUNNINGHAM
</b>          Me?   I'm not interested in murder.

Bruno pulls up a chair to face the two woman on the settee,
sits down, straddling the seat, to look at them over the
back of the chair and settle down for a nice conversation.

<b>                BRUNO
</b>        (his tone is teasing)
    Oh, come now, everyone's interested
    in that. Everyone would like to put
    someone out of the way. Now surely,
    Madame, you're not going to tell me
    that there hasn't been a time when
    you wanted to dispose of someone.
    Your husband, for instance.

    Well...

<b>                BRUNO
</b>    There you are, you see! There you
    are! All right, now you're going --
    to do a murder. How are you going
    to do it? This is the fascinating
    part -- how are you going to do it...I
    didn't get your name?

<b>                MRS. CUNNINGHAM
</b>    Mrs. Cunningham.

<b>                BRUNO
</b>    Mrs. Cunningham, how are you going
    to do it?

<b>                MRS. CUNNINGHAM
</b>        (entering into the
         spirit of the play)
    Well, I suppose I'll have to get a
    gun from somewhere.

<b>                BRUNO
</b>        (shakes his head)
    Tssk, tssk. Oh no, Mrs. Cunningham.

The other woman joins in:

<b>                      MRS. ANDERSON
</b>          What about a little poison?

<b>                     BRUNO

          That's better, Mrs. Anderson. But
          Mrs. Cunningham is in a dreadful
          hurry. Poison could take...let's
          see...ten to twelve weeks, if poor
          Mr. Cunningham is to die from natural
          causes.

<b>                      MRS. CUNNINGHAM
</b>          I have a wonderful Idea! I can take
          him out in the car and when I get to
          a lonely spot, knock him on the head
          with a hammer, pour gasoline over
          him and over the car and start the
          whole thing ablaze.

Mrs. Anderson laughs.

          best tools.

          Simple, silent, and quick. The silent

<b>CLOSEUP BRUNO
</b>
As he starts to Press her neck, his eyes wander from the
face of his "victim" to someone else off scene.


<b>MED. SHOT BARBARA
</b>
She is watching this rather unorthodox demonstration. The
CAMERA MOVES UP until her head fills the screen. Her glasses
glint in the light.


<b>CLOSEUP BRUNO
</b>
He is now transfixed. His breathing becomes heavy. A strange
expression comes over his face. He still stares off at
Barbara.

<b>BIG HEAD CLOSEUP BRUNO
</b>
He now seem to have almost gone into a trance. Over the
shot we begin to HEAR a strangled cry, and a broken
exclamation, then Mrs. Anderson's voice.

<b>                         MRS. ANDERSON'S VOICE
</b>          Mr. Antony!     Mr. Antony!

<b>                       ANOTHER VOICE
</b>          Stop him!   Stop him!


<b>CLOSEUP
</b>Bruno's wrists and hands and the neck of his victim. We can
just see Mrs. Cunningham's chin at the top of the screen.
Her head is tossing from side to side. Her hands are
clutching at Bruno's wrists. The hands of the other two
women, also in the picture, are pulling at Bruno's wrists.
Mrs. Cunningham's hands begin to slide off. Her head drops
back.

Over this we HEAR cries of:

</b>          Stop him!
          Help, somebody!
          Pull him off!

<b>CLOSEUP BRUNO
</b>
His body is swaying slightly at the various efforts to drag
him away from Mrs. Cunningham. His eyes begin to close, and
slowly he falls away from the picture in a dead faint on the
floor.


<b>MEDIUM SHOT
</b>
There is a rush of people around Mrs. Cunningham, who is
breathing frantically, her eyes opening and closing. A couple
of women are feebly slapping her hands, someone else is
fanning her face.


<b>MEDIUM SHOT
</b>
The Senator and Guy rush into the picture. They look at the
fallen Bruno. They search around for an explanation. Other
man come in ad they start to pick Bruno up.

Guy gives a quick look in direction of Mrs. Cunningham, sees
that she is being attended to.


<b>MEDIUM SHOT
</b>
Anne rushes into the picture. She sees Bruno being helped
to his feet; then turns her attention to Mrs. Cunningham,
who has now somewhat recovered. Mrs. Cunningham is helped
to the settee. There is a babble of women's voices trying
to explain what has happened.
<b>                         ANNE
</b>                 (thru the babble)
             Bring her upstairs.

As the two groups pass off in different directions, the few
people who ran into the scene late are asking the others
what the disturbance is. "What's wrong?" "Did she faint?"
"I didn't see anything." "What happened to him?" "Somebody
hurt?" But one small figure stands in the clear. It is
Barbara, She is still transfixed by what she has seen. Her
hands are trembling. CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN ON HER. We see
that her lips are trembling, too, and in her eyes frightened
tears are welling. Her breath is heavy.


<b>INT. STUDY
</b>
Bruno is stretched out on a settee. He is completely out.
His collar and tie are open. Two or three of the male guests
are just leaving the room. The Senator remains behind for a
moment with Guy.

<b>                         SENATOR
</b>             I thought he was a bit weird when he
             arrived. Who is he?

<b>                         GUY
</b>             I hardly know him, sir.

<b>                         SENATOR
</b>             Get him out of here as soon as you
             decently can -- will you. This is a
             nice item for the gossips. First
             thing you know, they'll be talking
             about orgies. I'd better get back...

The Senator leaves.   Guy stands over Bruno's outstretched
figure.


<b>MEDIUM SHOT
</b>
Bruno is now half awake. Almost without seeing Guy, he
staggers to his feet and begins to make his way to the door.
Guy advances, and with a sharp thrust, pushes Bruno back on
the settee.

Bruno looks and sees Guy clearly for the first time.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>          What happened? I was on a merry-go-
          round somewhere. It made me dizzy.

Guy moves forward, and thrusting his hand in Bruno's open
shirt, pulls him to his feet. Bruno ignores Guy's violence
and remain puzzled.

<b>                      GUY
</b>              (disgusted)
          You're a mad, crazy maniac, and you
          ought to be locked-up! Now will you
          get out of here and let me alone?

<b>                        BRUNO
</b>          But, Guy --

Guy smashes Bruno in the jaw, in utter disgust, and knocks
him back onto the settee. Bruno looks up from his sprawled
position, a dull look in his eye.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>          You shouldn't have done that, Guy.

<b>                      GUY
</b>              (subsiding)
          Come on -- pull yourself together.
          Do your tie up.

Bruno staggers to his feet. He fumbles at his collar.    As
he crosses to him, CAMERA MOVES IN to a CLOSER SHOT.

<b>                      GUY
</b>          Here -- let me.

He fixes Bruno's shirt and collar together and quickly ties
his white bow. Bruno stands swaying like a small boy as Guy
does this.

Barbara appears in the hallway, coming from the crowded
sitting room. She watches the two men go out the front door.

Bruno and Guy going out the front door. The man-servant
does not close it immediately, so we are able to HEAR the
call for Mr. Antony's car.

quite recovered from her ordeal. She hurries forward to
greet Anne who is hurrying down the stairs.

Anne comes out onto the steps and looks around.   She stops
short as she sees:

There are cars lined up outside on the street. One limousine
is pulling up in the center, two figures at the passenger
door. One is climbing in. The other is Guy.

him.

alarm. She goes on inexorably:

<b>                      GUY

          You see, Anne, that's why I didn't
          want you to know anything about this.
          I wanted to protect all of you --
          your father, Barbara. And now that

<b>TWO SHOT ACROSS THE STREET
</b>
As Hennessy watches Anne and Guy go toward the house, his
relief, HAMMOND, comes up. Hammond's a zealous, hard-eyed
sleuth.

<b>                      HENNESSY
</b>              (a little glum)
          Hello, Hammond.

<b>                      HAMMOND
</b>          You look worried. What's the matter?

<b>                      HENNESSY
</b>          You'd better keep on your toes.
          Something funny's going on.

<b>INT. GUY'S APARTMENT LATER THAT NIGHT
</b>
Still in his dinner clothes, Guy is seated in deep thought
near the telephone, wrestling with his problem. There is an
open telephone directory in front of him. He comes to a
decision, picks up the telephone and dials a number. He
waits for the answer, then:

<b>                      GUY
</b>          Bruno? Yes, yes, it's Guy...I've
          decided to do what you want. I'll
          make that little visit to father....
              (listens a moment)
          Tonight.
              (listens another moment)
          Yes, I want to get this thing over
          with, can you leave the house again,
          Bruno?
              (pause)
          You'd better stay out till daylight.

Guy hangs up, rises and starts to move with purpose for his
night's activities.

Guy is sitting at the table. He is dressed differently,
having changed from his dinner clothes to a sack suit. There
is only one lamp lighted in the room. Guy presents a grim
picture.

He is studying the plan of Bruno's house, and he picks up
the key Bruno sent along with it.  Finally he looks at his
watch, then folds the plan and puts it in his pocket with
the key. He rises, crosses to the  chest of drawers, opens
the top drawer.


<b>INSERT: THE OPEN DRAWER
</b>
Guy's hands take out the Luger. His hand then picks up
Miriam's glasses from the drawer, holds them a moment. He
is about to put them back, then decides to take them along,
puts them into his pocket.

<b>MED. SHOT

CAMERA PANS GUY across to the window.   He parts the curtains
slightly and looks out.

Hammond is lighting a cigarette as he strolls in front of
the house.

Guy crosses to his door, which he opens surreptitiously.


<b>MED. SHOT CORRIDOR
</b>
Guy glances down the stairs, then closes the door behind him
quietly and moves away to a window at the turn of the stairs.


<b>EXT. FIRE ESCAPE
</b>
Guy comes out of the window onto the second floor fire escape.
He creeps stealthily down and emerges into a narrow alleyway.
He steps back into the shadows for a moment when he sees:

<b>EXT. A TALL PAIR OF ELABORATE IRON GATES NIGHT
</b>
We are on the inside of the gates. We see them swing open
slightly and the figure of Guy edges through them.


<b>CLOSE SHOT
</b>Guy leaves the gates ajar and then, taking the plan of Bruno's
house from his pocket, and the key, he looks toward the house.


<b>EXT. STEPS LONG SHOT NIGHT
</b>
This is a long flight of steps. Moonlit. They are lined
with tall black cypress trees which throw their shadows across
the steps. Guy moves out of one shadow, into another and
carefully starts up the stairs.


<b>AT THE DOOR
</b>
He pauses, looks about for a moment and listens. Then he
puts the key into the lock, finding it with his flashlight.
The door opens a few inches. He turns off the flash, and
enters.

As Guy moves in soundlessly and closes the door.   He looks
toward the stairs which are in shadow.

Guy starts up the stairs slowly.   He carries his flashlight

A huge shadow lies it the head of the stairs. As Guy comes
slowly up the stairs, the Great Dane looks down at him.

<b>GUY ON THE STAIRS
</b>
He reacts to the sight of the dog, stops an instant, and
turn on his flashlight. The heavy massive face of the dog
looks straight down at him. Guy turns off the flashlight
and after a moment of indecision starts slowly up the stairs
once more, the dog watching every step he takes.


<b>UPPER HALLWAY
</b>
Guy comes up the last few stairs and still the dog hasn't
moved. Guy slowly edges past him and the Great Dane's head
turns to watch him.

<b>GUY
</b>
moving quietly along the hallway, approaches two doors. He
takes out his flash and identifies the door with his plan.


<b>INSERT:
</b>
The plan shows two doors in relation to the stairway. The
first one is clearly marked: "MY room." The adjoining door
is marked: "My FATHER'S room."


<b>CLOSE SHOT GUY
</b>
He pauses at the first door, then passes it quietly, walking
on to the next one. He turns the knob soundlessly and passes
through into the room.


<b>INT. ANTONY BEDROOM LONG SHOT
</b>
The room is in darkness except for the dim outline of the
recumbent figure in the bed. We hear Guy's voice, in a loud
whisper:

<b>                        GUY
</b>          Mr. Antony!

The figure stirs.


<b>ANOTHER ANGLE

Guy takes a stop closer to the bed.

            I must talk to you about your son.
            About Bruno. Mr. Antony!

The figure on the bed turns and a hand stretches out toward
a bedside light. The light goes on with a sudden glare.


<b>CLOSEUP FACE OF BRUNO IN THE LIGHT (LOW CAMERA)
</b>
The low CAMERA throws a vast shadow up on the wall behind
him, creating a grimace of his smile.
<b>                        BRUNO
</b>            Yes, Mr. Haines?


<b>CLOSEUP GUY
</b>
His face is dead.


<b>MED. SHOT
</b>
Bruno rises from the bed and sits on the and of it. He is
fully dressed, just as he was at the party, in white tie and
tails.

<b>                        BRUNO
</b>                (politely)
            My father isn't home tonight, Mr.
            Haines.
                (smiles grimly at
                 Guy's surprise)
            I was about to tell you that over
            the phone. But you came to such a
            sudden decision. I wondered why.

<b>                        GUY
</b>                (recovering quickly)
            Since you sent me a key to your house,
            I decided to use it -- to make a
            little social call on your father.
            I thought he'd be Interested to know
            he his a lunatic son.

The faintest flicker of Bruno's eyes indicates the intensity
of his reaction. He stares hard at Guy.

<b>                       BRUNO
</b>           Then a I correct, Mr. Haines, in
           assuming that you have no intention
           of going ahead with our arrangement?

<b>                       GUY
</b>           No intention whatsoever.      I never
           had.

<b>                       BRUNO
</b>           I see. You won't have any further
           use for the key, then, Mr. Haines.
               (he holds out his
                hand and Guy gives
                him the key)
           Thank you very such.

As Bruno continues to stare at him, Guy takes out the Luger.
For a moment a look of fear comes into Bruno's face as he
thinks Guy will probably shoot him. After a pause, Guy tosses
the gun on the bed.

<b>                       GUY
</b>           Or this.

Bruno's relief turns again to menace.      He picks up the gun
and fingers it nervously.

<b>                        GUY
</b>               (kindly)
           Look, Bruno. You're terribly sick.
               (haltingly)
           I don't know whether it's possible
           for you to realize it or not. I
           don't know much about these things,
           Bruno. But why don't you go someplace
           where you can get some treatment?
           Not only for your own sake, Bruno,
           but you can't go on causing more and
           more destruction to anyone you happen
           to meet.

Bruno pays no attention.     He rises.


<b>TWO SHOT

Guy's arguments have made no impression on Bruno whatsoever.
He fingers the gun.

<b>                       BRUNO

</b>            I have a murder on my conscience,
            but it's not my murder, Mr. Haines --
            it's yours. And as you're the one
            to profit, I think you should be the
            one to pay for it.

For an instant his nervous hands seem to be struggling with
the urge to kill Guy.

<b>                        GUY
</b>                (gives up)
            Well, I guess it's no use, Bruno.
            We sees to have nothing further to
            discuss.
Bruno goes to the door in silent acquiescence and opens it
for Guy to pass through.


<b>INT. HALLWAY MED. SHOT
</b>
Guy walks toward the stairs, tense and apprehensive. Bruno
is following him, still holding the gun. When the Great
Dane sees Bruno it gets to its feet, as if waiting for a
command.

Guy starts down the stairs but Bruno stays where he is, the
dog beside him. Gay turns and looks back it this tableaux
of menace.

<b>                        BRUNO
</b>            Don't worry. I'm not going to shoot
            you, Mr. Haines. It might disturb
            mother.
                (with a feeling of
                 power)
            I'm a very clever follow. I'll think
            of something better than that. Much
            better.

Bruno remains in the foreground of the scene as Guy proceeds
on down the stairs. We see him open the front door and pass
through.

apartment night.

</b>              (in the middle of his
               story)
          He came back at three twenty-five.
          I didn't even know he'd given me the
          slip until his 'phone kept ringing
          for about half an hour. Nobody sleeps
          that sound. So I got the janitor to
          let me in. No Haines.

          Shut up. I'd better contact Metcalf.

          questioning of Mr. Haines.

<b>                      HENNESSY
</b>          My dear Mr. Hamond, how many times

          nothing conclusive on Haines? There's
          no evidence that he was ever at the

Anne and Mrs. Antony are in the middle of a conversation.
Anne's manner is tense and purposeful, Mrs. Antony's much
less serious.

</b>          Oh, now, Miss Burton, really! I
          know Bruno's been in some very awkward

          But, Mrs. Antony, you've got to make
          him do something about this. Don't
          you see that just one word from him

          You know, Bruno sometimes goes too
          far.
               (girl to girl)
          Of course I shouldn't be saying this
          to an outsider, but sometimes he's
          terribly irresponsible and gets into

          Well, Miss Burton, it was very nice

          I find it so soothing.

she hears a voice:

Anne turns back in direction of the voice. CAMERA   PULLS
BACK until we can see the feet of Bruno protruding  from behind
a chair in which he is sitting. He has obviously   heard the
entire conversation between Anne and his mother.   Bruno rises.
He is in dressing gown and pajamas.

<b>                       BRUNO

          You know she hasn't been well for a
          long time. She's a little -- how
          shall I say -- confused.
              (shakes his head
               commiseratingly)

Anne is too stunned to speak.

</b>          You know, I'm very upset with Guy.

Bruno is now standing near the   window a little apart from
Anne, with his back to him. He    takes something out of the
pocket of his dressing gown and   looks down at it in his hand.
It is Guy's lighter.  Suddenly   he stuffs it back his pocket
and turn back to Anne.

<b>                      BRUNO

          up his lighter so the police wouldn't
          find it? He dropped it there, you

          do it, Miss Burton. It would have
          been too risky. And besides, it
          would have made me an accessory.

Anne stares at this insane man and sinks on the settee.   She
starts to cry in sheer frustration. Bruno goes to her
sympathetically.

He puts his hand on her shoulder. Anne flings it off. There
is an awkward pause as Bruno looks down at her. Then he
begins to look around restlessly.

He turns, starts out of the room and up the stairs in the

As Guy comes near to Bruno, the latter turns on him and starts

Against the whirling background of the merry-go-round, Turley

slightly hurt. The noise from the calliope is very loud.

At this moment the boatman rushes up.

A detective turns to the group around hIm.

<b>                      DETECTIVE
</b>          Get somebody to come and stop that
          thing!

An elderly man in soiled work clothes speaks up.

<b>                      WORKMAN
</b>          I'll handle it.

Immediately the workman heads straight for the merry-go-round
and starts to crawl under it on his stomach.

<b>                      DETECTIVE
</b>              (calls after him)
          Hey! Be careful! Stop!

A second detective speaks to him quizzically.

<b>                      2ND DETECTIVE
</b>          Well, do you want to do it yourself?

The first detective leans over and looks off toward the
workman who is continuing his slithering way under the
machine, then straightens up.

<b>                      1ST DETECTIVE
</b>              (changing his mind)
          No. I think he'll make it all right.


<b>MED. SHOT GUY AND BRUNO
</b>
Bruno swings around till his back is to us. He pushes Guy
toward the edge, but Guy manages to grab the rein of the
nearest horse. The momentum of the machine swings Guy around
against the horse, whose big head towers in the f.g. Bruno,
on this side of the horse pushes forward and tries to grab
the reins from Guy's hand. He tries to slash at Guy's face.
The back of Bruno's head is toward us during this. Guy
suddenly leans out across the horse and smashes his fist
against Bruno's face. Bruno's head goes back until it is in
the f.g. in a upside-down position.

<b>MED. SHOT

THE CAMERA IS LOW so that we get the effect of Bruno falling
into the CAMERA from Guy's blow!


<b>MED. SHOT
</b>
In the f.g. is a young boy of four years. He is excited by
the speed of the ride and laughs at the fight with great
enjoyment. He sees this by suddenly glancing over his
shoulder. In the b.g. Guy and Bruno are continuing their
fight. Bruno rises. Guy staggers after him. Bruno again
leaps upon Guy. The two men sway toward the CAMERA until
Bruno gets alongside the little boy. The boy now shows some
anxiety. The three figures now fill the screen with the
horses' heads in the f.g. Bruno is forced against the little
boy, who now, alarmed, beats Bruno on the cheek with one
hand, the other holding onto the brass rail in front. Bruno
stops and with a sweep of his arm, knocks the little boy off
the horse onto the floor below. The little boy, in falling,
grabs the horse's rein or stirrup.


<b>CLOSE SHOT
</b>
Guy breaks away from Bruno and dives around the back of the
horse to grab the little boy.


<b>CLOSE SHOT
</b>
As Guy grabs the boy, he staggers forward with him to a small
gondola. Bruno leaps onto his back but Guy manages to put
the boy in the gondola.


<b>CLOSE SHOT UNDERNEATH THE WHIRLING MERRY-GO-ROUND
</b>
The boat man is making slow progress.


<b>FROM HIS VIEW POINT

We see his goal. It is the wounded mechanic in the center,
who is slightly stirring. All during this the base of the
merry-go-round is skimming above the back and head of the
boat man.

<b>BACK ON MERRY-GO-ROUND
</b>
The two men are now in a clinch. Guy tries to fight off the
maddened Bruno. They are flung between the horses, bouncing
one against the other, almost half way around the merry-go-
round.


<b>CLOSE SHOT BRUNO AND GUY
</b>
Again they struggles between two horses. On each side of
them are two young screaming girls. The two bounce from one
horse to the other.

<b>CLOSE SHOT
</b>
The calliope has little figures and these boat away on their
cymbals almost as though they are applauding what's going
on.


<b>CLOSE SHOT
</b>
Underneath the merry-go-round, the boat man has made further
progress. He is creeping inch by inch. His nose starts to
run. He starts to fumble for a dirty piece of handkerchief.
He blows his nose and then moves on.


<b>CLOSE SHOT

Back above the two men swinging past the two girls on their
horse and they both crash to the floor underneath another
horse, upon which is riding side-saddle, a mother and her
three-year-old little girl.

</b>The merry-go-round his keeled over. For a moment we don't
know who has survived. There is a surge of people milling
and shouting. Those who have jumped back out of the way
when the merry-go-round toppled, now rush forward again as
the cloud of dust settles. From the midway in the background
others are running forward.

Distraught parents try to force their way to their children

feet by some men in the crowd. His knuckles are bleeding.

In the background people are rushing about. The crowd is in
uproar as women and children are helped from the wreckage.
Officials and uniformed policemen pushing back the surge of
the crowd.

Guy is surrounded by police and Campbell stands at his elbow.
At this moment the boatman runs in. One of the detectives
is with him.

<b>                      DETECTIVE

          He says this isn't the man we want.
              (with a nod in Guy's
               direction)
          It's the other one -- the one he was
          fighting with.

<b>                        TURLEY

                 quite taking it in)
          Not   Haines?
                (back to boatman)
          But   you said he was. You pointed
          him   out.

<b>                      BOATMAN
</b>          No, I didn't, sir. I've never seen
          this man before in my life. I meant
          the other one.

The detective who was holding Guy instinctively relax his
hold on Guy's arm. Turley turns to Guy, puzzled.

<b>                      TURLEY
</b>          What is this all about, Haines?        Did
          you know he killed your wife?

as Guy and Turley enter to the  spot where Bruno is pinned
under the overturned machine.   He is caught between two of
the horses, the head of one of  them across his chest. Bruno's
head sags back somewhat, but is  resting on pieces of debris.
A uniformed policeman looks up  from Bruno to Turley:

<b>                      POLICEMAN
</b>          This one's in a pretty bad way, Mr.
          Turley.

Guy is shocked at the sight of Bruno.

<b>                      GUY
</b>              (looking down at Bruno)
          Can't you get that stuff off him?

<b>                      POLICEMAN
</b>          No, they've done everything they can
          until the crane comes.

Bruno opens his eyes and sees Guy.

<b>                        BRUNO
</b>          Hello, Guy.

Turley has leaned forward to look at the helpless Bruno.

<b>                       BRUNO

               Turley)
          Who's that?

          So they got you at last, eh, Guy?

Guy looks around desperately, frustrated for a moment as
Turley eyes him stonily. Then he turns again to Bruno.

<b>                      GUY

          I haven't got it. It's still on the
          island where you left it.

Guy looks around helplessly to Turley, who looks back at him
suspiciously.

<b>                      DETECTIVE

Guy nods without speaking, and with a half look in Bruno's
direction.

Turley turns back to the group around Bruno. Guy looks down
for a moment at Bruno, then speaks to the boatman, who is
standing nearby.

<b>                      GUY

          Who was he, Bud?

Guy looks back sympathetically in Bruno's direction, speaks
without looking at the boatman.

With a sob, Barbara flings herself into Anne's arms. As she
cries, Anne strokes her head comfortingly. Then with a half-
choked sobs Anne, too, begins to cry. She speaks through
