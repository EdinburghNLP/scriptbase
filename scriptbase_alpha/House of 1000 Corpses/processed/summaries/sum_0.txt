In "House of 1000 Corpses", two young couples take a misguided tour onto the back roads of America in search of a local legend known as Dr. Satan.
Lost and stranded, they are set upon by a bizarre family of psychotics.
Murder, cannibalism and satanic rituals are just a few of the 1000+ horrors that await.
