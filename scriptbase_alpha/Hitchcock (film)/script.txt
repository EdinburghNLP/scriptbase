          EXT. MARSHLAND - DUSK
                         
          We move across smoldering embers and reach a small grass
          fire. Dirt is thrown over the flames before a BOOT finishes
          stamping them out.
                         
          SUPER: PLAINFIELD, WISCONSIN, 1944
                         
           HENRY GEIN (O.S.)
           We're just lucky it didn't reach the
           trees...
                         
          We move up two dirty pairs of overalls to find HENRY and ED
          GEIN sweating away as they continue shovelling out the
          flames. Both are in their forties and wearing flannel shirts.
          Ed wears an Elmer Fudd hat.
                         
           HENRY GEIN (CONT'D)
           There's gonna be a lot more jobs at that
           factory by Milwaukee come June. I could
           put in a word.
                         
                          ED GEIN
           You can't leave us, Henry. She needs both
                          OF US--
                         
                          HENRY GEIN
           Can you stop being a momma's boy for one
           second?
                         
          Henry looks at Ed and he shrinks back.
                         
           HENRY GEIN (CONT'D)
           I'm not trying to hurt you but Jesus you
           got to live your own life someday. That
           woman can take care of her own goddamn --
                         
          CLANG. Henry is hit by the shovel in the back of the head and
          goes down.
                         
          Ed steps slowly forward and puts down the shovel. The look on
          his face isn't anger. It's BLANK. He pulls at the flaps of
          his Elmer Fudd hat... then calmly walks away.
                         
          The camera pans until we discover :
                         
                         ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                         
          in his trademark black Mariani suit. He's been watching the
          whole thing, standing in the smouldering field only a few
          feet away, holding a rose-patterned cup and saucer of tea...

          He takes a sip and turns to address the camera --
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           Good evening.
                         
          He places his cup daintily back on the saucer.
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           Brother has been slaying brother since
           Cain and Abel, yet even I did not see
           that coming. I was as blind-sided as poor
           Henry over there.
                         
          He glances back over at the murder scene.
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           Apparently the authorities shared my
           naivete and believed the young man's tale
           that Henry fell and hit his head on a
           stone and died of smoke asphyxiation.
                         
          He shrugs: `Who would've thought it?'
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           Of course if they hadn't believed him, Ed
           never would have had the opportunity to
           commit the heinous acts for which he
           became famous... and we wouldn't have our
           little movie. Instead, we'd have more
           nice, safe, predictable ones like
           these...

           Mere Technicolor baubles.
                         
          He shudders with distaste. As if on cue the sky THUNDERS
          LOUDLY above him. He looks up and from behind the tree stump
          produces an umbrella.
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           Ah. A bit of doom and gloom. Now, that's
           more like it.

          ALFRED AND ALMA HITCHCOCK
                         
          Step out into a sea of FLASHBULBS. Hitch basks in the
          limelight while Alma, his razor-sharp, charming wife of over
          30 years stands in the background, uncomfortable with all the
          attention.
                         
          Hitchcock's agent LEW WASSERMAN, 45, dynamic, charismatic,
          comes into view.
                         
                          LEW WASSERMAN
           This thing is going to be gigantic. I
           wish I had twenty percent of the take.
                         
          Lew hustles them through the throng of REPORTERS and
          PHOTOGRAPHERS under their BLACK UMBRELLAS.
                         
                          REPORTER ONE
           Does tonight's incredible reaction
           surprise you, Mr. Hitchcock?
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           No, when I was planning North by
           Northwest I could already hear the
           screams and laughter.
           (then, to a BEAUTIFUL
                          BLONDE FAN)
           Any questions, my dear?
                         
          The blonde fan, holding out her autograph book, shakes her
          head `no' and giggles.
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           A pity.

          The reporters crack up. Alma manages a polite smile as Lew
          helps her into the limo, leaving Hitchcock alone for a moment
          to sign his autograph for the blond fan...
                         
                          REPORTER TWO
           Mr. Hitchcock, you've directed forty-six
           motion pictures. You host a hit TV show
           seen around the world. You're the most
           famous director in the history of the
           medium... but you're sixty years old.
           Shouldn't you just quit while you're

          HOLDING ON HITCHCOCK
                         
          motionless and quietly devastated as FLASHBULBS CRACKLE over
          his face. The whiteness transforms into...
                         
          INT. THE HITCHCOCKS' BEL AIR HOME - BATHROOM - MORNING
                         
          THE GLEAMING WHITE TILES of a bathroom. We move past chrome
          fixtures that evoke those in Spellbound and Psycho and arrive
          at that same pudgy hand pouring CHATEAU CHEVAL BLANC '53 into
          a cut crystal glass.
                         
                         HITCHCOCK
                         
          soaks in the tub. The champagne glass beside him, his
          corpulent frame is covered only by the London Times he's
          reading. Even in this deeply vulnerable state, he maintains
          the air of a haughty mischievous emperor.
                         
          At the sound of a bedroom bureau being opened, Hitch's eyes
          shift to the FULL-LENGTH MIRROR on the bathroom door.
                         
          IN THE MIRROR
                         
          We catch fleeting glimpses of Alma in a white half-slip and
          matching bra. She takes out some NYLONS and holds them up to
          the light.
                         
          Hitchcock watches enthralled. He puts down his glass and
          shifts a little in the tub, causing the water to lap against
          the sides.

          Alma pauses when she hears the small splashes. Neither upset
          nor amused she continues about her business, taking a skirt
          from the drawer.

          Hitchcock clears his throat, rattling his paper as if he'd
          been reading the whole time.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           Talking of arrows, did you read Mr.
           Weiler's review in the New York Times?
           Apparently, he found "the climax" to be --
           and I quote -- "overdrawn."

           Why do they keep looking for new masters

          further down into the water to hide his protruding belly.

          Today's outfit is, we sense, rather more stylish than what
          she would ordinarily wear.

           Well?
                         
          Hitch's gaze never leaves the photo gallery of his younger
          rivals in the `New Masters of Suspense' article...

          She leaves. Hitch grumbles and tosses his paper aside. He
          rises from the depths but suddenly loses his balance and
          grabs onto the SHOWER CURTAIN, wrenching it from the METAL
          RINGS on the rod.

          frustrated envy as CREW MEMBERS bustle in and out of STAGE
          15. It's a hive of activity.

          He gives her a good-bye peck and opens the door.

          Luxurious, wood-paneled and very British. Hitch sits
          restlessly behind his desk, receiving his morning shave from
          his private barber, SILVIO. His longtime assistant, PEGGY
          ROBERTSON, 40s, crisp, British, fiercely protective of her
          boss, is going through a list of potential projects.

           discover the corpse I'd hidden in the

           Si.
                         
          Hitch reaches for a carrot stick and CRUNCHES it.

           It's called North by Northwest. And
           "style" is merely self-plagiarism.
                         
          Silvio nods, then recommences the shave.

           or Miss Kim Novak to pretty it up.
                         
          Silvio unintentionally nicks Hitch's face.

          Hitch motions for the barber to hold up the mirror. The image
          of his face overflows the small frame. Repulsed, he leans
          back his head and makes a hand motion for Silvio to SLIT HIS
          THROAT.

          Alma lunches with screenwriter-novelist WHITFIELD COOK.
          "WHIT," 50s, is Hitchcock's physical opposite -- dashing,
          razor-sharp and sophisticated. In fact he'd be at home in one
          of his movies.
                         
                          WHITFIELD COOK
           ... Thank God I had a pocketful of
           pretzels. I was hiding in that props
           cupboard all night.
                          (THEN)
           That'll teach me to use a bedroom set
           instead of the real thing.
                         
                          ALMA
           Serves you right.
                         
          They laugh uproariously, quite at ease with each other.
                         
                          ALMA (CONT'D)
           Hitch always said your private life was
           in danger of being more entertaining than
           any of your plots.
                         
          He pours Alma another glass of wine, not remotely insulted.
                         
                          WHITFIELD COOK
           I can't believe he let me have you all to
           myself for a whole afternoon. Especially
           looking this beautiful.
                         
          He clinks her glass.

           That is one lucky garden.
                         
          Whit brings out a set of galleys and slides them across the
          tablecloth to her.

          appointment or assignation... Hitch cranes to see who she's
          meeting, but she moves tantalizingly out of sight.
                         
          Hitch turns back with a sigh towards his desk, covered with

          by the fire of his elegant Bel Air home. He takes another
          gulp of wine when he hears Alma enter and slides the wine
          glass out of view. Alma pops her head in the door.
                         
                          ALMA

          She comes back in again carrying some galleys, notices the
          title of Hitch's book -- some trash called "Psycho."

           Whit gave me the galleys of his new book
           yesterday at lunch. I've already got some
           ideas on how you could adapt it.
                         
          Hitch continues reading.
                         
                          ALMA (CONT'D)

          She taps Hitch's book dismissively with the galleys of "Taxi
          to Dubrovnik."
                         
                          ALMA
           This might be the one, Alfred.
                         
          He finally looks up.

           Leave it on the night stand.
                         
          As she leaves she points to Hitch's `hidden' wine glass.

           There are calories in that, you know.
                         
          But Hitch ignores her and turns to look out the window, his
          imagination starting to turn...
                         
          INT. GEIN HOUSE, PLAINVIEW, 1945 - NIGHT
                         
          Ed enters the bedroom. His mother, Augusta, is in the bed,
          faced away from him.
                         
                          ED GEIN
           Aren't you cold, ma?
                         
          She doesn't answer. We follow him to the dresser where he
          lingers a little too long over his mother's open underwear
          drawer before grabbing the blue coverlet on the side.
                         
          He comes over and spreads the extra blanket over her. Still
          wearing his jacket, he takes off his shoes, gets into bed and
          crawls up next to her.

          As he puts his arm around her and pulls her close, we reveal
          his mother's ghoulishly embalmed face.
                         
          INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          A slant of moonlight finds Alma fast asleep until a FINGER
          nudges her awake. She lifts her satin sleep mask to see
          Hitchcock holding out his copy of "Psycho."
                         
                          ALMA

          He switches on the light by her bedside. She sits up, puts on
          her glasses and reads from the opened page.

           "Mary started to scream, and then the
           curtains parted further and a hand
           appeared, holding a butcher's knife. It
           was the knife that, a moment later, cut
           off her scream... and her head."

          She turns off the light again and goes back to bed. A deep
          voice sounds from the darkness...
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK

          EXT. HITCHCOCK'S GARDEN - MORNING
                         
          The Hitchcocks eat breakfast on the terrace watching the
          GARDENERS trim the bushes and rake leaves from the pool.

          Alma can feel Hitch looking at her, waiting for a response.
          Clearly he isn't going to let this one go.
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           You're intrigued. Admit it.
                         
          She butters her toast, casually taunts him by adding a large
          spoon of marmalade.
                         
                          ALMA
           Actually, I think it's a huge mistake.
                         
          Hitch falls silent, a chastised schoolboy.

          She walks over, notices the LIFE MAGAZINE headline : "HOUSE

          He forges on through the guests only to get waylaid by Lew.
          It is a classic Hitchcock moment, a character needing to get

          INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, PANTRY - SIMULTANEOUS
                         
          Whit leans against the stove watching Alma expertly arrange
          the next round of hors d'oeuvres coming in from the kitchen.
                         
                          WHITFIELD COOK
           Now, if this were a Hitchcock picture
           what would two characters like us,
           married to other people, be saying?
                         
                          ALMA
           You don't have to pretend you're not
           upset he hasn't read it yet, you know.
                         
                          WHITFIELD COOK
           I'm a big boy. I can take it.
                         
                          ALMA
           Well, I loved it. What terrific fun it
           must have been to research.
                         
                          WHITFIELD COOK
           Certainly more fun than reading those
           reviews.

           Do you think he really will read it?
                         
          Suddenly, over Whitfield's shoulder, Alma sees Hitch looming
          in the doorway. Whit notes the tiny change in her eyes and
          turns.
                         
           WHITFIELD COOK (CONT'D)
           Speak of the devil.
                         
          Hitch stares blankly at him while Alma turns and busies
          herself over the sink, hiding an almost imperceptible blush.
                         
           WHITFIELD COOK (CONT'D)
           I have to admit, Hitch, I ran all over
           town looking for a copy of "Psycho" but
           couldn't find a single one.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           I wonder how that could have happened.
                         
          Hitch sips his martini, a picture of innocence. Then leans in
          to Whit's ear and whispers - just like Whit leaned into
          Alma's ear a moment earlier.
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           Don't stop looking on my behalf.
                         
          Peggy appears in the pass-through, beckoning Hitch to hurry
          back into the living room.
                         
          INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Hitch returns to see the other GUESTS are now passing around
          the GEIN PHOTOS. They look utterly confused and horrified...
          a couple of them are even gathering their coats.
                         
          ON LEW, PEGGY AND HITCH
                         
          standing together watching.
                         
                          LEW WASSERMAN
           I've seen happier faces on a school bus
           going over a cliff.
                         
                          PEGGY
           I told you it would be too much.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           But they can't stop looking, can they?
                         
          He slurps his martini, sharing a smile with Lew.
          INT. PARAMOUNT BOARD ROOM - DAY
                         
          Paramount President BARNEY BALABAN, 70s, ferocious,
          righteous, sits behind his impressive desk flanked by two
          CONSERVATIVELY-ATTIRED EXECUTIVES.
                         
          Hitchcock and Wasserman sit across from them.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           Audiences want to be shocked, Barney.
           They want something different. And this
           is it.
                         
          He gestures to the untouched copy of "Psycho" in front of
          Balaban.
                         
                          BARNEY BALABAN
           The truth is, Hitch, every time you want
           to do something "different" like The
           Wrong Man or Vertigo, someone loses
           money.
                         
          Hitchcock stares unblinking, giving nothing away.
                         
                          LEW WASSERMAN
           So we should stop trying to give them
           something new?
                         
                          BARNEY BALABAN
           You owe Paramount one last picture,
           Hitch. Can't you do something like North
           by Northwest but for us this time instead
           of for MGM?
                         
          Hitch's stare remains inscrutable.
                         
           BARNEY BALABAN (CONT'D)
           We've offered you dozens of perfectly
           good properties.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                          (IMPERIOUSLY)
           "Psycho."
                         
          Wasserman gives Balaban the same glacial stare. The Paramount
          executives shift uncomfortably.
                         
                          BARNEY BALABAN
           No one respects the name Hitchcock more
           than Paramount. But even a talented man
           sometimes backs the wrong horse.

          Balaban maintains a calm, pleasant front.
                         
                          BARNEY BALABAN
           I think you know me better than that,
           Hitch. I would never say "no" to you.
                         
          Hitch's suppressed rage is building...but Balaban says
          nothing.

          Hitch and Lew walk down the stairs and through the leafy
          courtyard past Hitch's office.
                         
                          LEW WASSERMAN
           What a putz. You know what his family did
           before they built those movie palaces?
           Ran a grocery store.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           My father ran a grocery store.

           Exactly. That's what I'm saying. He
           should show some respect.
                         
          Hitch turns to Lew.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           They think I've lost my touch, Lew.
           My association with television has
           cheapened me.
                         
                          LEW WASSERMAN
           Are you referring to that deal I got you
           where Bristol-Meyers pays you twenty-nine
           grand an episode and you own the
           negative? That's my kind of cheap.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           They just want the same thing over and
           over. They've put me in a coffin and now
           they're nailing down the lid.
                         
          Lew puts a comforting hand on him...
                         
                          LEW WASSERMAN

          ALMA does afternoon laps in the pool. A contemplative
          Hitchcock wanders down to the pool side wearing black
          sunglasses and a business suit. He watches Alma a moment.
          Finally she notices him.
                         
                          ALMA
           You're back early.
                         
          He shrugs, then sits at the table to pour himself a glass of
          lemonade. Alma gets out and towels herself off.
                         
                          ALMA (CONT'D)
           I'm disappointed you didn't give Whit's

           He knows you well enough.
                         
          She sits down next to him, noticing a tiny hole in her
          swimsuit. It's starting to look a little threadbare.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           Enjoy the pool now. We might not have it
           for that much longer.
                         
          He looks off cryptically.
                         
                          ALMA

           Interesting. But tell us, what exactly is
           Paramount distributing? Is this still a
           picture about a queer killing people in
           his mother's dress?
                         
                          LEW WASSERMAN
           What this picture is about is the
           reputation of Alfred Hitchcock.
                         
                          BARNEY BALABAN
           No-one's arguing that.

           Barney, it's very simple. This is Mr.
           Hitchcock's next film. Are you in or are
           you out?
                         
          A long silence.
                         
                          BARNEY BALABAN
           Well, obviously you have a lot of passion
           for this project. Let me talk it over
           with a few people internally and I'll get
           back to you.

           No. Now.
                         
          Balaban takes in their inscrutable stares. Not unimpressed by
          their chutzpah, he leans back and puts his hands behind his
          head, a king in his counting room.
                         
                          BARNEY BALABAN
           Fine. We'll take that deal. If you can
           get the money...
                         
          Finally, Hitchcock speaks up :

          He pulls out his PERSONAL CHECKBOOK and opens it on the desk.
          Barney watches as Hitch takes the onyx fountain pen from its
          mount.

          Hitch and Alma lie side by side in their separate beds. A
          copy of "The Dance of Death" by Strindberg lies on Hitch's
          bedside table. All traces of his bravado are gone...

           If this picture fails, Alma, we'll be in

           eating.

          INT. HITCHCOCK'S OFFICE, PARAMOUNT - DAY
                         
          PUDGY FINGERS part the slats of the blind. Hitch stares out
          hoping for some human moment to spy on. He's restless...
                         
          Peggy ushers JOSEPH STEFANO, 30s, into Hitch's office.
                         
                          JOSEPH STEFANO
           Joe Stefano. Good to meet you.

          Hitchcock leaves Stefano's hand dangling in mid air and sits
          down at his desk.
                         
           JOSEPH STEFANO (CONT'D)
           Sorry I was late. My shrink session ran
           overtime. I see him every day and it's
           still not enough.
                         
                          PEGGY
           I thought only director's assistants
           needed psychiatrists, not writers.
                         
          Stefano laughs off the barb and takes a seat as Peggy slips
          out.
                         
          The two men stare at each other but Stefano's not remotely
          intimidated.
                         
                          JOSEPH STEFANO
           Do you see a shrink, Mr. Hitchcock?
                         
          Hitch's eyes follow a plume of cigar smoke curling up to the
          ceiling...
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           No.
                         
          His gaze remains pointedly fixed on the ceiling.
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           I must say it boggles the mind to imagine
           what you and your "shrink" could possibly
           talk about daily.
                         
                          JOSEPH STEFANO
           The usual: sex. Rage. My mother.
                         
          Hitchcock lowers his gaze, suddenly intrigued.

          Alma sits with the Hitchcocks' ACCOUNTANT who's consulting a
          ledger. She sits at her desk in the corner of the kitchen.
                         
                          ACCOUNTANT
           There's still the federal income tax

           mention the absence of any salary while
           he's actually making the film...

          The Accountant takes off his glasses, plucking up the courage
          to look his favorite client in the eye.
                         
                          ACCOUNTANT
           Hitch wasn't exaggerating. If the film's
           a flop, you're going to have to sell the
           house.
                         
          Alma digests this.

          INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT
                         
          Alma's moved to the kitchen table and is sorting through the
          accounts herself, the dogs at her feet. Her face is now
          properly filled with concern.
                         
          Hitch enters, holding out some typed pages. Alma covers her
          worry. He puts the pages on the table next to her.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           I got Joe Stefano to write out the first
           few scenes. Why don't you take a look?
                         
          Alma takes Stefano's pages and starts to read...Hitch goes to
          the fridge and opens the door.
                         
                          ALMA
           We're about to have dinner. You don't
           need anything else.
                         
          He shuts the door. Leans against the fridge door. Hitch waits
          but she gives nothing away...until she off-handedly places
          the pages on the table...
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK

          The intimidating plaque for the MPAA's "PRODUCTION CODE
          ADMINISTRATION OFFICE" on the wall.
                         
          Stefano's TITLE PAGE is tapped angrily by GEOFFREY SHURLOCK,
          70s, the much-feared administrator for the Motion Picture
          Production Code. He sits at the head of a big table with TWO
          ASSISTANTS. Sitting opposite are Hitchcock, Peggy and several
          silent PARAMOUNT EXECUTIVES.
                         
                          GEOFFREY SHURLOCK
           The Code will absolutely not permit you
           to show a knife penetrating a woman's
           flesh.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           I assure you, Geoffrey, my murders, are
           always models of taste and discretion.
                         
                          GEOFFREY SHURLOCK
           Is there any improper suggestion of
           nudity in this murder scene in the
           shower?
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           She won't be nude. She'll be wearing a
           shower cap.
                         
          Shurlock makes a note. A man utterly devoid of any sense of
          humor.

           We might accept a shot from outside the
           bathroom window with Marion in silhouette
           above the shoulders -- provided the glass
           is frosted.
                         
          Hitch greets the suggestion with barely concealed contempt.
          Shurlock turns the page.
                         
           G EOFFREY SHURLOCK
           Then -- this scene with the toilet.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           It's completely necessary. Marion flushes
           evidence later found by her sister. It's
           a clue to the girl's disappearance.
                         
                          GEOFFREY SHURLOCK
           No American movie has ever found it
           "necessary" to show a toilet, let alone
           to flush it.
                         
          Hitch turns to Peggy and a Paramount Executive.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           Perhaps we ought to shoot the film in
           France and use a bidet instead?
                         
          No response from Shurlock's end of the room. Peggy stares
          down at the table.
                         
                          GEOFFREY SHURLOCK
           Mr. Hitchcock, if this office denies you
           a seal, and we're certainly heading in
           that direction, your movie will not be
           released in a single theater in this
           country. Will you be making jokes then?
                         
          Hitchcock gives a slow but meaningful shrug.
                         
           GEOFFREY SHURLOCK (CONT'D)
           Good. Now why don't we go all the way

          The analyst's MONTBLANC pen makes a note on a pad. We notice
          that his hands are surprisingly coarse.
                         
                          ANALYST'S VOICE
           What kind of impulses?
                         
          Finally Hitchcock is still. He stares up at the ceiling.

          A FRIDGE DOOR SNAPS OPEN to reveal Hitchcock's FACE in the
          darkness. He's in his pajamas. His hand trembles next to a
          stack of chicken breasts and moves to an upturned GRAPEFRUIT
          HALF at the back of the shelf.

          under the hollowed out grapefruit.
                         
          He's about to devour it when he catches sight of his
          DISTORTED REFLECTION in the chrome shelving.
                         
          He backs away, disgusted at this monster before him, the
          light of the fridge illuminating his expression.

          and teases out a bulging MANILA FOLDER. A hidden stash of
          some kind.
                         
          The DESK LIGHT is switched on revealing HITCH. He carefully
          extracts the contents of the folder and lays them onto the
          desk.
                         
          A MASS OF PHOTOS OF ALL HIS BLONDE LEADING LADIES
                         
          A personal collection lovingly kept. He settles in to study
          it, picking out his favorites, arranging them in order.
          They're all in the same pose, all with hair pinned up into a
          perfect bun.
                         
          He looks at each image with intensifying desire. He's created

          Hitch returns to the table to ponder yet more headshots.
          Peggy shares a glance with Alma, then slides over RODDY

          Hitch ignores the barb. Undeterred, Alma pushes her ace card:
          a photo of ANTHONY PERKINS, radiating offbeat sensitivity and
          teen idol looks.

           Think of the duality he could bring to
           Norman. The rage lurking behind that
           little-boy-lost grin. The winsome charm
           he uses to keep from being found out.

           Well, Norman is the logical extension of
           the boys in those movies. Appealing,
           sensitive, suffering the terrible burden
           of being forced to pretend to be
           something he is not.
                         
          Hitchcock's deeply-felt remark lands with Perkins.
                         
                          ANTHONY PERKINS
           My only worry is that playing Norman
           might cut too close to home.

           I was incredibly close to my mother. So
           close I remember wishing my father would
           drop dead. And then when I was five, he
           did just that...He keeled over from a
           heart attack.

           You see I've been guilty my whole life,

           Not to be prudish, but how far do you
           plan to push Norman's relationship with
           his mother?

          Hitchcock's RED SWEATING FACE as he grunts and heaves. He's
          dressed in gardening gear, laboring in the full bloom of the
          rose garden. Alma pushes a WHEELBARROW filled with manure.

          A quick look to Alma, as if to ask for permission before :
                         
                          JANET LEIGH
           She leads a double life. For instance,
           when she works at the Lowery office, she
           wears Tweed perfume. But, when she and
           Sam are together, she recklessly breaks
           out her one expensive bottle -- "My Sin"
           by Lanvin.
                         
          She notices Alma's expression.
                         
           JANET LEIGH (CONT'D)
           But...I do have a concern or two. I'm an
           actress but I'm also a wife and mother
           first, so I'm wondering just how you'll
           do that shower scene.
                         
                          ALMA
           You and the Shurlock Office.
                         
                          JANET LEIGH
           It's just... I mean even if you shoot me
           from here --
           (she indicates a spot just
           above her bosom)
           -- well it's not as if my figure is
           boyish.
                         
          Hitchcock looks down at her torso, as if noting it for the
          first time.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           Allow me to put your mind at rest.
                         
          Alma reacts as Hitch reaches over and gives Janet's hand a
          reassuring squeeze.
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           May I show you some of Mr. Saul Bass's
           marvellous story boards?
                         
          Hitch pulls out his folio case and shows Janet the
          storyboards (which we don't see).

          Alma's had enough. Janet's smile falters as she watches Alma
          get up and head to the restroom. She's unsure of what just
          happened but Hitch carries on regardless, either entirely
          oblivious or not caring at all...

          Alma enters and looks in the mirror, quietly devastated. She

          Alma is SUDDENLY TRANSFORMED into a Technicolor Hitchcock

          A bitchy STUDIO HEAD'S WIFE snaps Alma out of her reverie,
          joining her at the sink to powder her face.

           You're looking a little pale. No wonder
           with that thing your husband's working on
           now. You can't possibly approve.
                         
          She's had a drink too many but the throwaway comment still

          just like in a Hitchcock movie as we hear CLUNKING, then move
          over to catch a glimpse of Ed as he drags A WOMAN'S BODY,
          feet-first up the stairs. The clunking is from her head on
          the steps, which is wrapped in her dress.

          Ed approaches the shower curtain, then yanks it open with a
          METALLIC SCREECH. He pushes the body into the tub. Pulls the
          dress off her head and drops it on the floor.

           Stay here. I'm going to get the knives.
                         
          We pan to REVEAL HITCHCOCK standing in the corner. He looks
          terrified but completely enthralled -- he can't resist
          creeping forward for a thorough inspection. Hitch's POV as he
          steps closer to the tub and glimpses the woman's blood-
          spattered WHITE BRA and GIRDLE.

          contours.

           Break it to me gently. Am I playing a
           lesbian librarian?
                         
                          RITA RIGGS
           (re: the fabric)
           He chose it himself and had it imported
           from Paris.
                         
          Vera laughs dryly at a WIG on a dummy head.
                         
                          VERA MILES
           If I wear that, I'm going to look like

                          RITA RIGGS
           Wait until you see the undergarments he
           picked out for you.
                         
          Vera tosses off her shirt.
                         
                          VERA MILES
           I just have to keep telling myself, one
           more picture and I'm free as a bird.
                         
          She unhooks her bra and crosses to hang it on a hook right
          near the HOLE where we just saw Hitchcock's eye. His eye is
          gone, only darkness from the other side. Vera feels a chill
          and instinctively covers her breasts with her arm.

           Is there a fan blowing somewhere?
                         
          Rita returns with a punitive bra and girdle.

           Wow. The old man really is unhappy with

           Are you decent my dear?
                         
          JANET steps out dressed in a crisp, sexy white shirt and
          pencil skirt. She does a twirl for him. The effect is
          stunning. Even the stagehands stop to watch.
                         
                          JANET LEIGH

          As he escorts her onto the soundstage, Tony comes up to greet
          them.
                         
                          ANTHONY PERKINS
           I want to thank you again for this
           opportunity, Mr. Hitchcock.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           It's just "Hitch", Tony. Hold the cock.
                         
          Janet caught that -- she's clearly amused. Tony gives her a
          gracious peck on the cheek.

          Janet flicks a glance back at Hitch.
                         
                          JANET LEIGH
           And we're about to move to a whole new
           neighborhood.
                         
          Already, Tony can't help feel a little excluded from Hitch
          and Janet's little clique. Hitch ushers them across the
          soundstage where the crew are assembling.

          He steers her towards a line of laughing CREW MEMBERS forming
          a circle with the rest of the cast.
                         
          He takes Janet by the hand, placing her right next to him and
          officiously raises his right hand. The cast and crew duly
          follow suit, all except for Vera.

          Then tilt up to Janet's look of mock disapproval. Vera pokes
          her tongue out.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK

          Everyone cracks up, but Hitchcock's only interested in the
          reaction of his new blonde, standing in pride of place, right
          beside him.

          corrections, suddenly fed up with the all the work.
                         
          She looks out at the swimming pool, sparkling in the
          sunlight... then turns to the expensive-looking SHOPPING BAG
          half-open on the side...

          swimsuit. She breaks into a front crawl. Her strokes are
          vigorous, surprisingly so.
                         
          She drives the length of the pool, her arms slashing through
          the water with increasing speed, her feet kicking out with
          rising intensity... harder and harder... faster and faster...

                          ANTHONY PERKINS
           Now, Hitch, explain to me why I'm
           watching Marion undress?
                         
                          JANET LEIGH
           I feel like I should take offense at
           that.
                         
          She and Tony laugh. Hitch's eyes light up at this display of
          mischief from her.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           I don't know...Perhaps as a boy, Norman
           secretly watched his mother preparing for
           her nightly bath.
                         
                          JANET LEIGH
           Maybe there was a transom over the
           bathroom door?
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           Yes -- one he could access with a chair

           Well, a boy's first glimpse of a naked
           woman is usually his mother.

           You're the actor. You figure it out.
                         
          Tony flinches at Hitch's brusque response.
                         
          They arrive at the set wall, where Hitch removes a painting
          to reveal the PEEPHOLE.
                         
                          JANET LEIGH
           Hitch, I have a question. Why is the hole
           much larger on this side?

           All the better to see you at the greatest
           possible angle my dear...
                         
          Janet simply steps up and presses her face to the hole. Hitch
          studies her profile, quietly thrilled at her curiosity. Tony
          hangs back, watching Hitch watching her...
                         
                          JANET LEIGH
           Wow. You really do your research, don't

                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           It's just my Jesuit work ethic.
                         
          He takes a quick peek through the hole now too...then puts
          the painting carefully back into place over it.

           She was an extraordinary person. She
           exposed me to Ibsen, Strindberg, Shaw.
           She hoped I would go into engineering --
           carry a lunch pail, gold watch at fifty.

          the mahogany-paneled wall in the background.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           You're a fine one to talk.
                         
          INT. WARDROBE FITTING ROOM, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY
                         
          Hitchcock leads Janet to a row of brassieres, all laid out
          for inspection. They are all white with recognizable labels:
          Berlei, Triumph, Marks & Spencer. He picks out one of them.

           You will be wearing a white bra like this
           for the opening scene on the bed. And
           then after you've stolen the money...
                         
          They move on to a second row of brassieres - all dark.
                         
                          JANET LEIGH
           I switch to one of these.
                         
          He nods, correct. She moves over to a mannequin displaying
          the iconic jet black brassiere.
                         
                          RITA RIGGS
           Are you sure you don't want to look at
           something a little more elegant?
                         
                          HITCHCOCK
                          (SHARP)
           No. They have to look like they were
           bought at Sears and Roebuck. I want every
           woman in the audience to look up at Janet
           having sex with John Gavin and think,
           `that could be me'.
                         
          Janet reads the label. It's "Maidenform."
                         
                          JANET
           This is the brand I wear.
                         
          Hitch digests the information and turns to Rita.
                         
                          HITCHCOCK
           We're ready for a fitting.
                         
          As Rita starts to measure Janet's chest, Hitchcock lifts his
          hands and `frames' her...
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (V.O. PRE-LAP)
           We travel across the rooftops of downtown

           pick out a certain hotel window...

          HITCHCOCK'S HANDS have now become THE CAMERA, recording the
          scene already underway and now watched by HITCHCOCK, his
          DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY and CREW from across the stage...
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (V.O.)
           We pan over and discover John and Janet
           on the bed.
                         
          ...the camera moves to Janet and John making out on the bed.
          It's serious stuff.
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           She'll be wearing only her undergarments
           and a large glow of satisfaction...
                         
          JANET smiles up at John contentedly.

          Alma drives the gleaming black Cadillac through the UNIVERSAL
          GATES and pulls up to the production office outside the
          stage.

          Alma collects the script pages off the front seat and walks
          into the production office just missing Whit as he strolls
          back towards the writers building with a couple of pretty
          SECRETARIES.
                         
          Whit pauses when he spots the Hitchcocks' CADILLAC.
                         
                          WHITFIELD COOK
           You girls go on ahead.
                         
          The PRETTIEST ONE stops to make Whit light her cigarette
          before catching up with the others.
          INT. HITCHCOCK OFFICE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY
                         
          Peggy reads the final pages while Alma inspects the
          production boards.

           The people who matter know. That's all
           that counts.
                         
          As she makes a few more changes to the schedule. Alma turns
          to Peggy whose face tightens as she continues reading.
          Clearly it's strong stuff.
                         
                          PEGGY
           I'd hate to see Shurlock's face when he
           reads this.
                         
          She puts the pages down.
                         
                          PEGGY (CONT'D)
           Alma, you always know the answer. Is this
           really going to work?
                         
          A candid moment between the two women... but Alma doesn't
          answer, just leaves.

          Alma emerges into the sunshine and looks across at the
          soundstage, wondering whether she should go over there...
                         
                          WHITFIELD COOK
           Hello, stranger.
                         
          She turns to see Whit leaning against the Cadillac.
                         
                          ALMA

                          ALMA
           In a state of unbridled ecstacy now that
           he's back on the set.

           Not bad. I've got eight hundred words to
           do for Reader's Digest on what it's like
           to be married to a man obsessed by
           murder.
                         
          He looks at her a moment.
                         
                          WHITFIELD COOK
           I've got a better idea.
                         
          He steps closer.
                         
           WHITFIELD COOK (CONT'D)
           Why don't we drive out to Santa Barbara?
           We'll have Emilio fry up those juicy
           steaks we like at El Encanto.
                         
          He playfully tugs at her sleeve.

          Alma's expression gives away nothing as we pan over to the

          Hitch looks out at Whit and Alma through the window, just
          like he did with the other couple earlier. Except this little
          interaction is far from dull.

          INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY
                         
          - and puts the grocery bags down on the counter. She listens.
          The house is eerily quiet, until, from behind --
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           Was there a line at the market?

          cryptic ways.

           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           Even your friend Whitfield Cook would be
           better in the scene.

           You should tell Whit that. He'd be
           flattered.
                         
          She gets to work preparing a salad. Hitch studies the back of
          her tiny, vulnerable neck, the delicate sinews and muscles as
          they rise and flex.

           Maybe I was too dismissive about your
           friend Whitfield's book. Perhaps he and
           Elizabeth could come over this weekend
           and he can walk me through it.

          He carefully folds his blanket as if wrapping a murder
          victim. She's not exactly sure what he's implying but she
          knows she doesn't like it.

          She turns onto her side away from him. Pulls the blankets
          around her, her eyes still WIDE OPEN.

                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           ... You think they can't tell... but they
           can. They know. It's all closing in on
           you. The noose is tightening...
                         
          As he continues, we pull back and see:
                         
          THE REAR-PROJECTION SET
                         
          Janet emotes for Hitchcock's CAMERA while "driving" a PARTIAL
          CAR, being rocked by STAGE HANDS.
                         
          Peggy and other CREW time and mark the takes. ELECTRICIANS
          AND GAFFERS turn mounted lamps that rake across Janet's
          worried face like car headlights.
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           You could return the money secretly, but
           what would be the point?
                         
          He wipes his brow, getting more intense...
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           You, Marion Crane. The prim and proper
           girl who's always been so tight and
           respectable. So perfect and untouchable.
           Well, they know all about your dirty
           little secret, don't they? Your messy,
           sticky lunchtime trysts. Yes, your boss
           Mr. Lowery could even smell the sex on
                          YOU--
                         
          SUDDENLY THE REAR SCREEN film breaks and a frame burns.
                         
          It's a good thing because Janet is starting to look a little
          uncomfortable -- was that meant to be funny? As technicians
          yell and hustle, Hitchcock turns to Peggy --
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           Circle that.
                         
          INT. JANET LEIGH'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY
                         
          As Janet gets changed, Vera hangs up her frumpy coat on a
          rack, looking over a little enviously at Janet's good
          girl/bad girl underwear hanging nearby.
                         
                          VERA MILES
           Have you talked to him much about your
           personal life?

           Not really...
                         
                          VERA MILES
           I'd keep it that way if I were you.
           (Off Janet's look)
           He starts by choosing your hairstyle and
           clothes and then he wants to choose your
           friends and decide how many children you
           should have.
                         
          Janet finds this a little hard to believe. Vera leans in,
          lowering her voice.
                         
           VERA MILES (CONT'D)
           That poor, tortured soul Jimmy Stewart
           played in Vertigo? That's Hitch, only
           younger, slimmer and better-looking.
                         
          That may well be true but it doesn't bother Janet.
                         
                          JANET LEIGH
           Compared to Orson Welles, he's a
           sweetheart.
                         
          They both turn, sensing something -- and see HITCHCOCK'S
          DISTINCTIVE SHADOW PROFILE in the hallway. The shadow
          lingers, then recedes like in a scary ghost story.
                         
                          VERA MILES

          They laugh nervously.
                         
          INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME
                         
          Alma comes in from her gardening, and settles on the sofa
          with a cup of tea, a circled copy of TV Guide next to her.
                         
          On television -- the 1950 Hitchcock classic Stage Fright.
          The credits come up: "Screenplay by Whitfield Cook,
          Adaptation by Alma Reville."
                         
          Alma watches, thrilled at the sight of her name and Whit's
          together.
                         
          ON THE TV
                         
          The words "DIRECTED BY ALFRED HITCHCOCK" overwhelm the small
          screen. Alms puts down her fork, no longer hungry.
          INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, HALLWAY - DAY
                         
          ALMA heads back to the kitchen, only to pause at the open
          door to Hitch's study -- there's something on the desk.

          THE HITCHCOCK BLONDES
                         
          Hitch's personal collection. Alma enters and starts to go
          through them. Each photo is turned over a little more roughly
          than the last. It's hard to tell whether she's more angry at
          the photos or the fact that they've been deliberately left
          for her to find...
                         
          Alma takes off an earring, picks up the phone and starts to
          dial...
                         
          INT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - SAME TIME
                         
          As the crew prepares the car set to go again, Hitch strides
          over to PEGGY who's dialing a phone.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           What's the hold up?
                         
                          PEGGY
           It's still engaged.
                         
          He takes the phone himself just as Vera Miles emerges from
          her dressing room, script in hand.
                         
                          VERA MILES
           Hitch, I'm stuck on Lila's first scene. I
           don't know how strongly I should confront
           Sam and the detective and I --

           Fake it.
                         
          He turns his back on her and dials. The ENGAGED TONE blares
          in his ear. His eyes narrow at some crew members fussing with
          bits of LIGHT and SOUND EQUIPMENT.
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           Does it really require two men to carry a

          He raps the receiver button, more intensely this time, and
          redials.

          But Alma's still on the phone to Whit, basking in his charm.
          Her feet are up. There's a drink in her hand.
                         
           WHITFIELD COOK (ON PHONE)
           Well, I think that sounds like a fabulous
           idea. We'll have a late lunch. I'll make
           the reservation for one thirty.

          She hangs up, toying with her earring, feeling better already
          when the PHONE rings again very quickly. She picks up without
          even thinking --

          Pudgy fingers clench the coiled PHONE CORD as we move up to
          Hitch's face. He's silent as a burglar, not even daring to
          breathe...

           Whit? Is that you?
                         
          The blood drains from Hitch's face as he very slowly and
          carefully replaces the receiver. His mind starts to spin.
          He's got to get out of there...
                         
          CROSSING THE STAGE
                         
          Hitch lurches towards the production office, starting to
          sweat, but his path is blocked by GRIPS laying cables. The
          set is suddenly a cacophony of noise and chaos.
                         
          A PR FLACK appears --

          Hitch brushes past him to find another route but more grips
          are moving a ladder. He turns, kicks a platter of healthy
          snacks out of the way, only for an ARCLIGHT to swivel in his
          face and blind him.
                         
                          PEGGY
           Are you okay? You've gone very pale.
                         
          Peggy's face suddenly comes into focus.

          HITCH exits the soundstage doors, only to find the humorless
          face of BARNEY BALABAN blocking his office door.
                         
                          BARNEY BALABAN
           Hello, Hitch. How's the picture? I'm
           hearing interesting things...

           It's a wonder you can hear anything over

           office.
                         
          Balaban offers up his handkerchief. Hitchcock waves it away
          even though he's now covered in sweat.
                         
                          BARNEY BALABAN
           I shouldn't be in a position of just
           hearing things, Hitch. It's time you
           showed me some footage.

          Whitfield, in true Hitchcock leading man style, has the

                          WHITFIELD COOK
           Those steaks haven't changed at all, have
           they?
                         
                          ALMA
           It's so nice not to have to take care of
           someone, even if it's just for an hour or
           two.
                         
          She takes in the sparkling scenery whipping past.
                         
                          ALMA (CONT'D)
           Whit, where are we going? You still
           haven't told me.
                         
                          WHITFIELD COOK
           I have a little surprise.
                         
                          ALMA
           A surprise. How fun.
                         
          Whit just smiles as he jams the acceleration and the car
          ROARS off down the highway.
                         
          EXT. HITCHCOCK'S OFFICE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY
                         
          Hitch stands in the parking lot tapping his foot impatiently
          near the parked Ford Fairlaine police car used in `PSYCHO'.
          Janet watches him, sitting behind the wheel of her VOLKSWAGEN
          BEETLE. After a moment she toots her horn and drives up.
                         
                          JANET LEIGH
           What happened to your driver?
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           I've been asking myself the same thing.
                         
          She smiles.
                         
                          JANET LEIGH
           I can give you a ride if you want.
                         
          Hitchcock raises an eyebrow at the tiny car, and then, with
          great effort inches his massive frame through the open door.
          INT. CAR - MOVING - DAY
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           Did you know Adolf Hitler sketched the
           design for this car on Ferdinand
           Porsche's cocktail napkin in a Berlin
           beer garden?
                         
                          JANET LEIGH
           I didn't.
                         
          She turns to see Hitch wedged uncomfortably into his seat.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           It's only now that I truly appreciate
           just how diabolical Herr Hitler was.
                         
          She notices him eyeing the half-eaten bag of CANDY CORN on
          the dashboard (the kind Norman Bates enjoys throughout
          "Psycho".)
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           May I?
                         
                          JANET LEIGH
           Help yourself.
           (letting him in on it)
           I pinched them from Tony's dressing room.
                         
          He takes one and chews it curiously.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           So this is what they eat at the drive-
           ins...
                         
          He takes the whole bag and sets to work, popping them in one
          after the other.
                         
                          JANET LEIGH
           I thought you only ate Fauchon chocolate.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           Needs must when the devil drives, my
           dear.
                         
          He's so deadpan but now there's no way to tell if he's joking
          or not. She puts the car into gear, sensing his despair.

          The water laps over their toes.
                         
                          ALMA
           I don't mind that he uses his obsession
           to fuel his art. I just don't like it
           when he uses it against me.
                         
                          WHITFIELD COOK
           He's like any great artist. Impossible to
           live with but worth the effort.
           (he throws a rock into the
                          SEA)
           Van Gogh wasn't exactly a walk in the
           park either.
                         
                          ALMA
           Did you know when we started out I was
           his boss? He didn't even dare ask me out
           until he'd worked his way up to assistant
           director.
                         
          Whit watches as she picks up some sand, lets it run through
          her fingers...
                         
                          WHITFIELD COOK
           What do you think of that place over
           there?
                         
          He nods to a SMALL BEACH HOUSE up the way.
                         
                          ALMA

           It's mine.
                         
          She looks at him askance. Is he joking?
                         
                          ALMA
           I just saw Elizabeth. Why on earth didn't

                          WHITFIELD COOK

           So what did happen between you and Vera?
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           I was going to make her star. But she
           chose the life of a housewife.
                         
          He stops chewing. We push in as his features turn reflective.
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           I cast her as the lead in Vertigo. Then
           two weeks before filming she told me was
           pregnant.
                         
          He screws up the empty bag of candy and looks over at Janet.
          Then, almost like a child --
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           Why do they do it? Why do they always

          Alma enters the beach house cautiously and looks around. It
          is old and falling apart with only a few functional
          furnishings.
                         
                          WHITFIELD COOK
           I'm just leasing it for the offseason. A
           place to get away from the wife and kid
           and write.

           You might find that room interesting.
                         
          Alma looks. The door is partially open -- she sees the one
          conspicuously new item of furniture. A double bed.
                         
                          ALMA

           perfect hideaway.
                         
          She lets this sink in, entranced by the incredible view and
          the crashing surf.
                         
          Then, she steps out onto the deck and up to one of the
          typewriters. Gives the key an approving TAP.

          It's his collection of PHOTOS by the TELEPHONE. They're all
          neatly stacked.

          Finally, the sound of the car comes up the driveway.
                         
          He turns onto his side and pulls up the blankets, listening
          to the sound of the front door ... and Alma's footsteps down
          the hall.
                         
          She quietly slips into the bathroom and shuts the door before
          turning the light on. He watches her shadow through the strip
          of light at the bottom of door.
                         
          When the bathroom light switches off again Hitch hurriedly

          He silently picks up her HANDBAG and takes it to the window.
          Using the moonlight he searches its contents. Car keys.

          the glare of the open fridge, a beast feeding in its cave,
          shoving in mouthful after mouthful. It's almost pornographic
          in its indulgence.
                         
          GEIN steps out of the shadows and puts a comforting hand on

          Alma blinks, unable to hide her shock.

                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           (with mock compassion)
           The plot's a muddle. Some of the jokes
           are awfully like things we already did
           better hundreds of years ago in The Lady
           Vanishes. And your villain is weak. But
           the biggest failure is the relationship
           between the hero and heroine.
                         
          He picks up a radish and bites into it.
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           If you weren't so smitten with your
           friend Whitfield cook you'd probably see
           that.
                         
          Alma is entirely stunned. Hitchcock has delivered the killer
          blow he intended. He gets up and goes over to the garden
          door.

          Hitch searches his pockets for his lighter but can't find it.
          His annoyance only increases when he notices the SCATTERED
          LEAVES `contaminating` the surface of the pool.

          Over and over, Margo attacks with the knife and Janet tries

          as if paralysed in some Freudian nightmare.
                         
                         A TELEPHONE

          EXT. BEACH HOUSE, SANTA BARBARA - DAY
                         
          It is inside the beach house, and partially drowned out by
          the sound of the crashing waves. Alma and Whit are on the
          deck, acting out the scene as they write, too engrossed to
          notice.
                         
                          WHITFIELD COOK
           What if Helen and Michael try and get
           into the cab at the same time?
                         
                          ALMA
           Even better, what if they reached for the
           cab door at exactly the same time?
                         
          Alma demonstrates so that their hands touch.
                         
                          ALMA (CONT'D)
           That way, we could start close on the
           hands...
           (tracking the movement)
           ... and then tilt up to the eyes.
                         
          They stare into each other's eyes, lips just inches apart...
                         
                          WHITFIELD COOK
           That feels better already.
                         
          Finally, the phone intrudes.
                         
                          ALMA
           Are you going to get that?
                         
          With some effort, Whit goes inside and picks it up.
                         
           WHITFIELD COOK (O.S.)
           Hullo?... Yes... Hold on.
                         
          He comes outside, holding out the receiver for Alma.

          Hitch lies slumped on the floor. A compress over his
          forehead. His head lolls to one side as he slips in and out
          of consciousness...

          MARTIN BALSAM watches as SAUL BASS, cameraman JACK RUSSELL
          and A.D. HILTON GREEN argue about the best way to proceed
          with the staircase sequence. Hitch is conspicuous by his
          absence.
                         
          As they bicker we find Tony Perkins off to one side, sitting
          in his Mrs. Bates costume, unable to cope. He puts the wig
          back on his head. There, that feels better...
                         
          Balsam's finally had it with all the arguing. He walks off
          past Peggy who's arriving with the PHONE.

           Hilton. I have Mr. Hitchcock for you.
                         
          She gives him a warning look. "Watch out. He's in a terrible
          mood." He waves away her concern. It can't be that bad.
                         
                          HILTON GREEN

          He empties the tablets into the sink and very carefully,

          He takes a step towards Hitch's empty chair, but Alma moves
          to block his path. It may be a small gesture, but it's highly
          charged.
                         
          Barney stares down at her.

           is.
           (then, closer)
           The smart thing to do would be to help
           Hitch finish it.

          bit...

           But on a Hitchcock picture, there is only
           one director.
                         
          The anger flashes on his face as she faces him down, the
          entire crew behind her now, holding firm...
                         
          EXT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY
                         
          Balaban, incensed, leaves the stage with Kirkpatrick. Alma
          steps out into the sunlight not far behind them. As she
          watches them leave, she lets out a breath.
                         
          A voice calls out to her --
                         
                          WOMAN'S VOICE
           Mrs. Hitchcock?
                         
          She turns to see Janet walking over in Capri pants and a
          sleeveless top. She's carrying an elegantly wrapped package.
                         
                          JANET
           I hope you don't mind. I heard Hitch was
           sick so I got him a little something.
                         
          She hands Alma the gift. A bag of candy corn tied with a
          ribbon.

           I haven't always had that from my

          She's an impossible rival for any woman.

          He slowly pulls the ASPIRIN BOTTLE from his robe pocket,
          building suspense as he unscrews the lid and pours SAND into
          a tiny pile on the coffee table in front of him.

           on every aspect of this film so far, as I
           have done on every picture you've done in
           the last three decades. And the first
           time you show the film, it will be my
           notes that you want. I celebrate with you
           if the reviews are good and I cry for you
           if they are not. I host your parties and
           put up with those fantasy romances with
           your leading ladies. And when you're out
           promoting this film around the world, I
           will stand beside or, rather, slightly
           behind you, smiling endlessly for the
           press even when I'm ready to drop, being
           gracious to people who look through me as
           if I were invisible because all they can
           see is the grand and glorious "Alfred

           I'm doing with Whit gives me pleasure and
           purpose.

           exist.
                         
          He studies her a moment.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           There was a time when I thought I
           understood you so completely --
           understood women....
                         
          Hitch gives a very slight bow, touches her on the shoulder,
          then leaves. Vera watches him go, struck by his rare show of
          vulnerability.
          EXT. BEACH HOUSE, SANTA BARBARA - DAY
                         
          Wind blows sand off the dunes. Alma sits in the parked car
          outside the beach house, contemplating the typed pages on the
          seat next to her. An inkling that they may not be as magical
          as she had hoped.
                         
          No matter. She checks her reflection in the rearview and
          applies some lipstick, readying herself.
                         
          She collects the pages and heads up the steps to the deck.
          She sees two typewriters and paper, but no sign of Whit.
          Something doesn't feel right.
                         
          She turns and in the bedroom, through the window, she sees
          Whitfield Cook making love to a young woman -- it is the
          pretty SECRETARY from the studio lot. Alma and Whit's eyes
          meet. Whit is horrified at being caught.
                         
          Alma ducks her head, wheels around in shock.
                         
                         ALMA'S CAR
                         
          She yanks open the door and gets in. Whit runs half dressed
          from the house...
                         
                          WHITFIELD COOK
           Alma, I thought you were coming later
           tonight.
                         
                          ALMA
           I thought you rented this place so we
           could write.
                         
                          WHITFIELD COOK
           I did. I swear -- this just happened.
                         
          She struggles to get the key in the ignition. He puts his
          hand desperately on the car door.
                         
           WHITFIELD COOK (CONT'D)
           You won't say anything, will you?
                         
                          ALMA
           Don't worry. I won't tell Elizabeth.
                         
                          WHITFIELD COOK
           I mean to Hitch.
                         
          Whit smiles feebly.
                         
           WHITFIELD COOK (CONT'D)
           We can't all be geniuses.

           WHITFIELD COOK (CONT'D)
           Alma -- you're incredibly talented. But,
           after all... we want him to read the
           script with an open mind.
                         
                          ALMA
           Oh, I wouldn't worry about that, Whit.
                         
          She starts the car and drives off.
                         
          Whit watches, deflated, knowing he's ruined everything, his
          receding figure swallowed up by flickering white light...
                         
          INT. SCREENING ROOM, PARAMOUNT STUDIOS - DAY
                         
          WE PLAY THIS SCENE ONLY OVER THE FACES OF A SMALL INVITED
          AUDIENCE -- THEIR EXPRESSIONS TELL US THAT THE FOOTAGE THEY
          ARE SEEING IS NOT GOING OVER WELL. NOT AT ALL.
                         
          Lew sits with Barney Balaban and two executives. Lew
          discreetly checks his watch out of boredom. Shurlock and his
          two Assistants look appalled. Composer BERNARD HERRMANN, late
          40s, prickly, sits in the back row looking suicidal. He
          glances back at Hitchcock who stands near the screening room
          door looking worse, if that could be possible.
                         
          EXT. SCREENING ROOM, PARAMOUNT STUDIOS - LATER
                         
          Shurlock exits and approaches Hitchcock who's waiting in the
          foyer.
                         
                          GEOFFREY SHURLOCK
           You're going to have to cut all that
           nudity.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           What nudity? It was suggested.
                         
                          GEOFFREY SHURLOCK
           I definitely saw that knife jabbing her.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           We did no such shot.
                         
                          GEOFFREY SHURLOCK
           I'd stake my reputation on it. I'm
           recommending you cut the shower scene
           entirely.
                         
          Hitchcock is livid but holds his tongue.

           I'll go over it frame by frame and set up
           another screening.
                         
          But Shurlock is already walking away...
                         
          Wasserman emerges from the screening room conversing with
          BALABAN. Hitch searches their expressions for some indication
          but Balaban strides off without saying a single word to him.
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           What's the verdict?
                         
                          LEW WASSERMAN
           Let's just say it was a four-letter
           review and it wasn't `good'.
                         
          The harsh reality devastates Hitchcock.
                         
           LEW WASSERMAN (CONT'D)
           Screw him. It's too late for Paramount to
           back out no matter what Balaban says.
                         
          Hitch just stands there.
                         
           LEW WASSERMAN (CONT'D)
           The other route is to recut it as a two-
           parter for the TV series. Because of the
           budget and the Hitchcock name, we stand a
           good chance of breaking even.
                         
          Still, Hitch doesn't say a word.
                         
           LEW WASSERMAN (CONT'D)
           Look, I made Jimmy Stewart a millionaire
           of Winchester 73 and that was a dog. At
           least I could sit through your picture.
                         
          Hitch stares bleakly off. He can't help noticing the KIM
          NOVAK-TYPE he spied on earlier outside, hand in hand and
          kissing her date.
                         
           LEW WASSERMAN (CONT'D)
           More importantly, what does Alma think?
                         
          INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY
                         
          Alma sits with the Hitchcocks' ACCOUNTANT going over the
          books again, looking at the revised figures. They close the
          books and sit back and look at each other.
                         
                          ALMA
           Is there anything else we can do?

                          ACCOUNTANT
           We'll just have to wait and see how the
           movie turns out.
                         
          Alma gets up and crosses to the window. Stares out at the
          pool reflecting a leaden sky... and the clumps of dead leaves
          floating across its surface...
                         
                          ALMA

          The dogs, GEOFFREY and STANLEY, lap away at a water bowl in
          the study. A splash or two of something is added to the bowl
          from above. It's being poured from Hitch's brandy glass.
                         
                         HITCH
                         
          pours himself another glass, leaving the dogs lapping happily
          away as he goes over to the Steinway Grand. There's a bank of
          silver-framed PHOTOS on top. He pauses to take a proper look
          at them.
                         
          His and Alma's life together in movies. Smiling at Premieres
          with Cary Grant and Grace Kelly. On vacation with Jimmy and
          Gloria Stewart. At a black tie event with Ingrid Bergman and
          Gregory Peck.
                         
          But it's the PHOTOGRAPH tucked away at the back that he wants
          to see most.
                         
          A BLACK AND WHITE PUBLICITY STILL taken on the set of The
          Mountain Eagle in 1926. He picks it up and looks at it:
                         
          The young Hitchcock in front of the camera, dramatically
          calling "Action!" on his first film. His eyes don't have to
          move far to find ALMA, standing just behind him, making notes
          on her clipboard, the same intense, serious look on her face.
                         
          They look so young...
                         
          Hitch turns to look out the window, thoughtful -- Hitch's
          POV. It's SNOWING outside.

          on a stool nearby watching him.
                         
          Trash and newspapers are piled everywhere. There is grime and
          dark stains on the cabinets and counters.

          Hitch watches Gein as he threads a needle, stitching
          something expertly together. He notices there's no hint of a

          ANGLE ON DOORWAY
                         
          Hitchcock reads Alma's fragile emotional state and enters. He
          sits down beside her and studies the screen for a moment.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           An odd little movie. Of course, Colbert
           is wonderful.
                         
          Alma nods. They watch for a beat longer.

                          ALMA
           Cold and miserable.

           Just like Barney Balaban's face.
                         
          He indicates the over-ripe dialogue coming from the TV.
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           Whit isn't worth a damn when he's not
           working with you.
                          (PAUSE)
           And neither am I.
                         
          Alma takes in his reflective expression, but says nothing.
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           I didn't pull off the picture this time.
           It just sits there, refusing to come to
           life.
                          (THEN)
           There's no other way to say it... It's
           stillborn.
                         
          ALMA turns away.
                         
          Hitch sits there bereft in the lonely silence.
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           I let you down, my love.
                         
          He moves closer and takes her hand. Gives it a small squeeze.
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           You deserved better.
                         
          She still doesn't move. After a moment Hitch gets to his
          feet.
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           I'll go and feed Geoffrey and Stanley,
           shall I.
                         
          He exits with the dogs padding after him. She turns back to
          the screen and more of that stilted, mannered dialogue.
                         
          Tears well in her eyes.
                         
          EXT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          A full moon. The ONLY LIGHT from inside the house is the one
          in the kitchen.
                         
          We glimpse the figure in the window. A corpulent man in
          profile, like a Hopper painting.
          INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, KITCHEN - LATER
                         
          Hitch sits in his nightgown, pushing some VEGETABLES around
          his plate -- his healthy midnight snack.
                         
          Alma enters in her robe. Hitch watches her. She goes to the
          fridge, opens the PRODUCE DRAWER and from under the brussel
          sprouts pulls out a tiny hidden jar of BELUGA CAVIAR.
                         
          She gets the crackers, a plate and a spoon and sits down at
          the table next to him.
                         
                          ALMA
           I don't think I can stand both of us
           being maudlin.
                         
          She fixes several crackers, each with an appropriate dollop
          of caviar on top, and puts the plate in the middle.
                         
                          ALMA (CONT'D)
           There is one solution to all this, you
           know.
                         
          She offers him one of the crackers.
                         
                          ALMA (CONT'D)
           We could both get to work -- together.
                         
          Tentatively, Hitch accepts it.
                         
                          ALMA (CONT'D)
           That tiresome little Hitchcock imitation
           I've been helping Whit finish is done.
                         
          Hitch remains quiet, delicately consuming his cracker.
                         
                          ALMA (CONT'D)
           So I suggest, for everyone's sake, we
           start whipping Psycho into shape
           tomorrow. You may not be the easiest man
           to live with but you know how to cut a
           picture better than anyone.
                         
          Hitch puts the lid back on the caviar.

          CANS OF FILM ARE BROUGHT IN BY ASSISTANTS, STRIPS OF
          CELLULOID ARE PULLED OUT, INSPECTED AND MARKED WITH CHALK
          WHILE OTHERS ARE SPLICED TOGETHER.
                         
          HITCH and editor GEORGE TOMASINI wait quietly like
          schoolboys, while Alma reviews the footage on the Moviola.
                         
                          ALMA
           You'll need to cut those six or seven
           frames where she blinks after she's
           supposed to be dead.

           Cut it tighter. The minute I lose one
           person I've lost the whole audience.
                         
          TWO PAIRS OF HANDS. Hitchcock's and Alma's. They work like a
          pair of twenty-year-olds at a pair of MOVIOLAS cutting the
          picture.

          The impact of the music is instant and unimaginably powerful.

           I take your opinion very seriously. But
           what you think you're seeing is purely
           informed by the power of suggestion. I
           assure you that once you view the final

           A "lyrical score" won't change my

           I have a modest proposal to make. If

           sequence as it is, I will reshoot the
           opening love scene to your exact
           specifications.
                         
          Shurlock reacts with surprise.
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           In fact, I'd welcome your personal
           supervision on the set.
                         
          Shurlock is more flattered than he'd care to admit.

          INT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY
                         
          Hitchcock and Peggy confer. John Gavin and Janet Leigh,
          wearing robes, chat while lying on a bed. Crew members wait
          impatiently. Peggy checks her watch.
                         
                          PEGGY
           He's been harassing you since you
           announced this project, you invite him to
           the set, and he doesn't even show up?
           What did you tell him?
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           That I respected him. Deeply.
                         
          Peggy laughs. Now she understands.
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           Ladies and gentleman, that is a wrap.
           Thank you all.
                         
          The crew starts breaking things down. The actors are baffled.
          Janet walks over to him.
                         
                          JANET LEIGH
           I thought we were reshooting the scene.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           No need. The charade is over.
                         
          Hitch holds out his arm for her and walks her back to the
          dressing room.
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           See, I wasn't that much of a monster to
           work with, was I?
                         
                          JANET LEIGH
           Not at all.
                         
          He offers his hand and she shakes it, determined to be
          professional to the end.
                         
           JANET LEIGH (CONT'D)
           I just hope I was sufficiently loyal to
           the cause.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           Worthy of a Purple Heart, my dear.
                         
          She leans in and gives him a peck on the cheek. A moment of
          unexpected heaven that leaves Hitch speechless.

          She walks away to her dressing room. Hitch watches as she
          steps inside and closes the door.
                         
          After a moment we hear a PIERCING SCREAM --
                         
          INT. JANET LEIGH'S DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Janet recoils at the sight of A MRS. BATES PROTOTYPE "PROP
          MASK" grinning lewdly from her chair, and wearing one of
          Janet's brassieres.
                         
          Hitchcock peeks inside as crew members come running.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           I hope you don't mind, I told Mrs. Bates
           she could have your dressing room.
                         
                         ON JANET
                         
          She can't believe she's been caught out. She closes the door
          on everyone... and then after a moment SCREAMS AGAIN... but
          this time not out of shock.
                         
          INT. HITCHCOCK'S OFFICE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY
                         
          Hitch sweeps in. Lew is waiting for him.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           We have our seal from Shurlock's office.
                          (DEVILISHLY)
           Now, we lead the lambs to the slaughter.
                         
          Hitch turns to Lew for the latest news.
                         
                          LEW WASSERMAN
           The front office confirmed. They're only
           opening the movie in two theatres, as we
           suspected. And no premiere. If we don't
           get word of mouth we're dead.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           Then we'd better get started. Peggy, take
           a memo...
                         
          Peggy whips out her steno pad.
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

          BOOKLETS make the rounds on a conveyor-like contraption. As
          the booklets are bound by swift-moving WORKERS, we see
          Hitchcock's photo on a cover and his "advice" to theater
          owners.
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (V.O.)
           My first instruction to Theater Owners:
           Hire Pinkerton guards to strictly enforce

          A MANAGER opens up his PSYCHO PROMOTIONAL HANDBOOK and starts
          to read, totally baffled.
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (V.O.)
           Furthermore, because Psycho is so
           terrifying and unique, the guards can
           help you deal with customers who run
           amok.

          Hitch lays down the track into a large microphone while Alma
          watches from the recording desk.

          A row of life-size HITCHCOCK STANDEES are carried in through
          the door one by one. Posters are hung in the theatre lobby.
          The letters hoisted up and hung on the marquee outside.
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (V.O.)
           "To further emphasize the sheer,
           unrelenting shock and suspense of Psycho,
           right after the closing title "THE END,"
           we strongly recommend that you close your
           house curtains over the screen for a full
           thirty seconds."
                         
          Inside the theatre, the manager makes sure the CURTAINS open
          and close correctly then turns to face the vast, empty
          auditorium.

          And wait.
                         
          Across the foyer, a spotty young THEATRE EMPLOYEE sweeps up
          ticket stubs and empties ashtrays, quietly going about his
          business, entirely oblivious...
                         
          ON HITCH'S FACE
                         
          As he grips the railing. This is taking far too long.
                         
          And then -- finally -- the sweetest sound in the world A
          BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM.
                         
          Soon the WHOLE AUDIENCE SCREAMS IN TERROR... then breaks into
          LAUGHTER again... nervous laughter this time, the best kind.
                         
                         HITCH
                         
          As he gestures with his hands, a conductor leading his
          orchestra, raising them up again as the audience STARTS
          SCREAMING AGAIN right on cue
                         
          PUSHING TIGHTER ON HITCH
                         
          As the dam breaks and all the pent-up emotion floods out...
          leaving only relief and satisfaction... and making way for a
          smile... the largest of his whole career.
                         
          INT. NEW YORK THEATRE - LATER
                         
          Hitch, Alma and Peggy are led out into the foyer by the
          theatre manager. There are still SCREAMS in the theatre as
          the show continues.

          Lew can be seen on the phone in the theatre manager's office
          in the background as Hitch, Alma and Peggy walk past the line
          of ticket buyers to get to the front doors. There is great
          excitement now as more and more people recognize the
          Hitchcocks...
                         
           WOMAN WAITING ON LINE
           Mr. Hitchcock, how does it end?
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           I promised Mother I wouldn't tell.
                         
          He gets a laugh. Hitchcock walks alongside the Theater
          Manager who's not going to miss out on having his own moment
          with the crowd.
                         
                          THEATER MANAGER
           Mr. Hitchcock, what do I do now that my
           wife won't take a shower after seeing
           your movie?
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           Have her dry-cleaned.
                         
          Laughter as Lew appears.
                         
                          LEW WASSERMAN
           I just got off the phone with Balaban. I
           couldn't resist telling him we're sold
           out for the next two weeks.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           What did he say?
                         
                          LEW WASSERMAN
           He said "Tell Hitch congratulations. A
           well deserved triumph as we always knew."
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           "As we always knew..."
                         
          The two friends a look.
                         
                          PEGGY
           Does this mean I can take the weekend off
           now?
                         
          Hitch playfully shrugs, "we'll see".
                         
                          THEATRE MANAGER
           I'm sorry, Mr. Hithcock but there are
           photographers outside. They heard you
           were here.

          EXT. THEATRE - DAY (LATER)
                         
          A few photographers snap Hitch as he emerges and heads past
          the line of ticket buyers towards the waiting car. Hitchcock
          gestures for Alma to take her place next to him instead of
          behind him. She shyly waves him away but eventually, and
          appreciatively, relents.
                         
          As the flashbulbs start to POP --
                         
                          ALMA
           This could be the biggest hit of your
           career, Alfred.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK
           Our career, Alma.
                         
          He looks into her eyes with nothing but deep, intense
          gratitude and joy. As more flashbulbs pop --
                         
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
           I've realized I'll never be able to find
           a Hitchcock blonde as beautiful as you.
                         
                          ALMA
           You do realize I've been waiting decades
           to hear you say that.
                         
          He gives her a gentle peck.
                         
                          ALFRED HITCHCOCK

           "The Master of Suspense"...
                         
          He helps her into the car.

          It is a utilitarian institutionalized dining room. Several
          nonviolent INMATES eat at different round tables around the
          room.
                         
          An ATTENDANT watches, and an ORDERLY mops the floor (there

          spoken older man, CHET. Ed is heavier, his hair is whiter,
          and he is much more at ease than we've ever seen.
                         
                          ORDERLY

                          ORDERLY
           Claudine and I are driving to Chicago
           with her folks to see that Psycho movie.
                         
          The Attendant pulls the orderly aside, and whispers to him,
          nodding toward Ed. The Orderly's jaw drops! It is the coolest
          thing he's ever heard. He looks at Ed like he's a movie star.
          Meanwhile, Ed yawns, content. Utterly oblivious.
                         
                          CHET
           I think you're the happiest guy I've ever

                          ED GEIN
           I'll tell you. You live your life, and
           it's unbearable sometimes but there's
           this secret, Chet; a big secret no one
           else knows or wants to tell...
           (he leans a little closer)
           ... there is a God and he's so big and
           powerful, he doesn't always remember
           you're there...
                         
          He takes a huge bite blueberry pie.
                         
           ED GEIN (CONT'D)
           ... but if you can get his attention and
           he sees you're suffering, he'll notice
           and he'll take care of you. My mother
           used to tell me -- she's passed, God
           bless her -- the one thing God truly
           loves and understands is suffering.
                         
          He takes a long drink of milk.
                         
           ED GEIN (CONT'D)
           After all, he invented it.
                         
          We pan to discover HITCHCOCK has been watching all this. He
          turns to the camera.

           And so, gentle viewer, Psycho -- the
           picture everyone predicted would bring me
           to wrack and ruin -- was such a hit that
           Alma and I got to... Well, let's just say
           that we got to keep our house -- and the
           swimming pool. And the same critics who
           despised it went on to call it one of my
           greatest achievements.
                         
          He produces a CIGAR and wanders towards the exit doors.

           Of course for me, it was just another

           But you know what they say in Hollywood:
           "You're only as good as your last
           picture." So, now, if you'll excuse me, I
           must toddle off to begin the exhaustive
           search for my next project.
                         
          He holds out his cigar towards something we don't yet see...

           Unfortunately I find myself once again
           bereft of all inspiration. I do hope
           something comes along soon...
                         
          A SMALL BIRD
                         
          Alights on his cigar tip and FLAPS its wings. Hitchcock can't
          resist blowing a sadistic plume of smoke at the bird which
          promptly flies away. He gives the camera a final
          characteristically deadpan look...

           Good evening.
                         
          The distinctive THEME TUNE to his TV show starts up and Hitch
          toddles back up the front lawn and toward the terrace, where
          Alma can be seen laying out a delicious healthy lunch...
