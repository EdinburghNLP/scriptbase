     EXT. COLUMBUS, OHIO - DAY

     The state capital of Ohio.  It's an impressive building for 
     a city this size.

     SUPERTITLE: COLUMBUS, OHIO - STATE CAPITAL

     INT. OHIO STATE SUPREME COURT - DAY

     In chambers striving for august, JUSTICES listen to a lawyer 
     MR. RODMAN, argue his case before the highest court in Ohio.  
     Mr. Rodman enjoys the sound of his own voice.

                    MR. RODMAN
          This informant, paid by the police, 
          using taxpayers dollars to continue 
          his felony drug habit, was the link 
          which allowed police to raid a private 
          farm.  A working farm.  A farm where 
          honest Americans make their living.

     One particular justice, ROBERT WAKEFIELD, younger than the 
     others, is clearly bemused by this performance.

                    MR. RODMAN
          The government, in its haste, has 
          employed an army of criminals whose 
          allegiance to the truth is, at
          best, questionable --

     Judge Wakefield interrupts --

                    ROBERT
          Mr. Rodman...it's too bad your client 
          didn't show as much sense in choosing 
          what he planted as he did in choosing 
          his attorney...

     A polite chuckle from the justices --

                    ROBERT
          Lately the only variation I'm hearing 
          in your argument is the name of the 
          client.  And you can sit there all 
          day arguing the ins and outs of 
          Illinois v. Gates, but you aren't 
          going to convince me that this country 
          has not sanctioned the use of 
          anonymous informants.
               (beat)
          Furthermore, there is no sacred 
          protection of property rights in the 
          United Sates.  When you make the 
          decision to have marijuana on your 
          farm, whether it's one joint or an 
          acre of plants, your property can be 
          seized and your property can be sold.

                    MR. RODMAN
          I'm sorry the court finds my argument 
          repetitious.

                    ROBERT
          Mr. Rodman, may I offer a piece of 
          advice?  The next time you argue 
          this point before this court, 
          regardless of my whereabouts, I 
          recommend you have something up your 
          sleeve other than your arm.

     INT. ROBERT'S CHAMBERS - DAY

     The office is marble and dark wood.  A young CLERK, black, 
     29, enters carrying an oddly-shaped gift.  They both look at 
     it.

                    CLERK
          What do you think it is?

                    ROBERT
          Depends who it's from.

                    CLERK
               (reading the card)
          Your friends at Warren, Putnam and 
          Hudson.

                    ROBERT
          You can learn a lot about somebody 
          from this stuff.  Three categories: 
          you like me, you hate me, you want 
          something from me.
               (re: the elaborate 
               box)
          Definitely third category.

                    CLERK
          What would a law firm want from the 
          new drug Czar?

                    ROBERT
          Depends on the state.

                    CLERK
               (checks)
          Arizona.

                    ROBERT

               (beat)
          Or am I being cynical?

     They both laugh.  Robert reaches up and pulls a bottle of 
     Scotch from a shelf.  He pours a couple of fingers in two 
     glasses.

                    CLERK
          Maybe there's a book in it.

     The clerk takes one of the glasses.

                    ROBERT
          Not by me.

     They toast and drink.

     EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

     Robert exits, trailed by a small group of reporters.  He 
     gets into a car being driven by two security TYPES.

     INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

     Robert sits in a business class window seat.

     INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

     An expensive hotel.  Robert Wakefield stands at the window, 
     looking at the view of our nation's capital.

     SUPERTITLE: WASHINGTON D.C.

     ON THE TABLE

     The remnants of a meal.  It was a steak and a small caesar 
     salad.  The wine glass is half-empty.

     ANOTHER ANGLE ON ROBERT

     In front of the mirror now, trying on a dark, tasteful jacket.

     CLOSER

     On Robert in the same position, only now we are in HIS HOME.  
     It's daytime, and his wife BARBARA is helping him into this 
     same jacket.  As her hands dust the lint off his shoulders

                         WE MATCH CUT TO:

     ROBERT

     In the hotel rooms, making the same motions.  Satisfied, he 
     straightens, then turns to look at himself.

     ANGLE ON ROBERT

     Back at the hotel room window now.  Reaches to the table and 
     lifts the wine glass.

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY

     This is the middle of nowhere.  Scrub cactus and dust and a 
     heartless sun.

     SUPERTITLE: MEXICO - TWENTY MILES SOUTHWEST OF TIJUANA.

     A broken down-looking Police Sedan is parked on the side of 
     the road.  It seems abandoned except there are TWO MEN inside.

     INT. POLICE SEDAN - DAY

     Two Mexican men, State Police officers, JAVIER RODRIGUEZ, 
     30's, and MANUEL "MANOLO" SANCHEZ, 20's, wearing jeans, knock-
     off Polo shirts, and cowboy boots, wait patiently in the 
     car.

                    JAVIER
          I had that dream again.

     A long pause.

                    MANOLO
          Which one?

     Another long pause.

                    JAVIER
          Where my mother's suffocating.

     They continue to wait until there is the sound of a JET 
     ENGINE.  It grows LOUDER as it approaches.

     EXT. THE POLICE SEDAN - DAY

     The shadow of a large plane crosses the desert floor.  Then, 
     an old DC-3 flies fifty feet above the Police Sedan.

     INT. POLICE SEDAN - DAY

     They watch the plane disappear over a small rise in the 
     desert.  They look at each other and wait some more.

     EXT. MEXICAN DESERT - LATER

     From the direction of the landing strip, a moving van lumbers 
     down the road, two TEENAGERS in the cab.

     INT. POLICE SEDAN - DAY

     Javi and Manolo watch the moving van approach.  Javi reaches 
     under the seat and picks up a bubble flasher.  He rolls down 
     the window and plants it on the roof.  He flips the switch.

     Nothing happens.  He jiggles the wire and the siren BURPS 
     and the light flashes.  Manolo and Javi step from the car, 
     smiling.

     EXT. MEXICAN DESERT - DAY

     The moving van slows to a stop.  Javi approaches.  The DRIVER 
     unhurriedly rolls down the window.

                    DRIVER
          Is there a problem?

                    JAVIER
          No.  There's no problem.

     The driver hesitates a confused beat then reaches for his 
     wallet.

                    DRIVER
          Okay.  I see.  How much do you want?

     The driver pulls a wad of bills.  Javi shakes his head.

                    DRIVER
          You want more than this?

     Javi shakes his head.  The driver exchanges a look with his 
     partner.

                    DRIVER
          You want something else?

     Javi smiles.  The driver gets out and walks to the back of 
     the truck.  He opens the rear door.  There are neatly-stacked 
     crates marked with a SCORPION logo and "911."  He reaches 
     into one of them and pulls out a tightly-sealed package also 
     with the scorpion stamped on it.  He turns to see Javi with 
     his gun drawn.

     Manolo, at the passenger side, has also drawn his gun and is 
     motioning the partner to move to the back of the truck.

                    JAVIER
          Drop the package.  Put your hands 
          behind your head.  You're under 
          arrest.

     The driver hesitates.  He starts to comply then looks at 
     Javi and Manolo.

                    DRIVER
          I don't understand.  I think there 
          must be some mistake.

                    JAVIER
          No, there's no mistake.

     Javi motions to Manolo who cuffs both teenagers.  The driver 
     begins spewing OBSCENITIES under his breath.  Javi puts the 
     driver in the front of the Shadow.  Manolo follows in the 
     moving van.

     EXT. DIRT ROAD - MEXICO - LATER

     The truck follows the Shadow down a desert road.

     Suddenly, from behind, four armored SUV's with tinted windows 
     appear, closing fast.

     The SUV's force both vehicles off the road where they pull 
     to a stop.  A long beat as hot wind blows desert detritus 
     past the truck.

     Finally, the SUV doors open and FEDERAL POLICE OFFICERS 
     surround them like a SWAT team.

     The passenger door of the lead SUV opens and GENERAL ARTURO 
     SALAZAR, 50's, a squat, powerful presence in a perfectly 
     pressed uniform gets out and approaches Javi.

                    SALAZAR
               (to Javier)
          What's your name?

                    JAVIER
          Javier Rodriguez.

                    SALAZAR
          Well, Javier Rodriguez, you've done 
          a very good job, but we'll take care 
          of it from here.

     Javier stares into the implacable reflection of his 
     sunglasses.  In the distance, the DC-3 takes off and ROARS 
     over their heads.

                    SALAZAR
          We've been following these Narco-
          trafficantes for some time but had 
          not been able to bring them to 
          justice.
               (to his men)
          Put the prisoners in the car.
          Impound the truck.

     The men follow Salazar's orders.

                    SALAZAR
               (to Javi)
          One question.  How did you find about 
          this?

                    JAVIER
          An informant.

                    SALAZAR
          What is the name of your informant?

                    JAVIER
               (beat)
          It was an anonymous tip.

     Salazar looks at Javi a beat.

                    SALAZAR
               (to his men)
          For a State Police officer, you're 
          very well informed.  Let's go.

                    MOMENTS LATER
          Javi and Manolo watch the convoy of 
          vehicles drive away.

     Javier lights a cigarette.

                    MANOLO
          Wasn't that General Salazar?

                    JAVIER
          Yeah.

                    MANOLO
          What's he doing up here?

                    JAVIER
          I don't know.  Something.

     They start for their car.

     EXT. DEL MAR SELF-STORAGE - DAY

     SUPERTITLE: SAN DIEGO

     Two men, RAY CASTRO, 30's, proud, ambitious, and MONTEL 
     GORDON, 40's, suspicious of everyone including himself and 
     always, always the smartest guy in the room, walk from a 
     Lincoln Towncar toward a dumpy office.  Castro is talking 
     under his breath --

                    CASTRO
          No telltales.  Nothing to read.
          Not touching my face.  Not even 
          blinking.  No giveaways.
               (beat)
          How're you feeling?

                    GORDON
               (keyed up)
          I feel good.

                    CASTRO
          No more pissant basin league bullshit 
          for us, hunh?

                    GORDON
          Nope.

     Castro stretches his arms, swings them around.

                    CASTRO
          Limbering up, gonna stay loose, keep 
          it all together.  Take this 
          motherfucker down.

     They reach the door to the office.  Gordon looks at Castro, 
     then turns the handle.

                    CASTRO
          Showtime.

     INT. OFFICE, DEL MAR SELF-STORAGE - DAY

     It's a cluttered, rundown working office unusual only in the 
     extent of its ordinariness.  A SECRETARY goes about her 
     business like a somnambulist.  CLERKS shuffle and file.

     Castro switches into Spanish --

                    CASTRO
               (in Spanish)
          Good afternoon, ladies, gentlemen.  
          We're looking for Eduardo Ruiz.  We 
          have a two o'clock appointment.

     INT. OFFICE, DEL MAR SELF-STORAGE - LATER

     In a back alcove, Castro and Gordon sit across a cheap table 
     from EDUARDO RUIZ, 40's, an entrepreneur in an expensive 
     suit and bad hairpiece.  They are waiting.

                    RUIZ
          You ever buy a quarter ton?  Not 
          many people have.

     Another "businessman" enters from another door and whispers 
     in Ruiz's ear, then leaves again.

                    RUIZ
          So, it's worth the wait, right?
          What can I do?  Rent a Huey?  Have 
          an airlift?  It's not like you can 
          put it in a condom up some mule's 
          asshole, right?  How many peasants 
          would that take?  A line stretching 
          from here to Mexico City --

                    GORDON
          Nobody said shit, Eduardo --

     One of Ruiz's hands dips under the desk where we see a handgun 
     is holstered on the underside.

                    RUIZ
          Relax.  We're waiting, that's it.

                    CASTRO
          Hey, you want to hear a joke?  I got 
          a joke.  Why do women wear makeup 
          and perfume?

                    GORDON
          Chill out --

                    CASTRO
          It's a funny fuckin' joke and it's 
          quick.  Why do women wear makeup and 
          perfume?

                    RUIZ
          I don't know.

                    CASTRO
          'Cause they're ugly and they stink.

     Castro laughs uproariously.

     INT. DEA SURVEILLANCE SPACE - DAY

     ON FUZZY SURVEILLANCE VIDEO: Castro laughing.  Ruiz politely 
     smiling, one of his hands hidden by the table.

                    GORDON
          Man, you never been close enough to 
          a woman to know how she smells.

                    DEA AGENT (V.O.)
          What's his hand doing?  Watch his 
          hand.  Anybody?  I don't like the 
          hand.

     IN THE OFFICE

     The room is filled with crappy surveillance equipment.  DEA 
     AGENTS, in DEA logo'd outerwear, jiggle a monitor fuzzily 
     displaying the view from another hidden camera: Gordon and 
     Ruiz around the cheap table.

                    DEA AGENT
          This is ridiculous this fucking thing.
               (taps monitor)
          Look at this shit -- the first 
          television transmission.  I had better 
          shit when I was the AV guy at junior 
          high, swear-to-God.

                    ANOTHER DEA AGENT
          Come on, Castro, pay attention.
          Watch his damn hands.

     ON THE MONITOR

     Another "businessman" enters the office and whispers in Ruiz's 
     ear.

                    RUIZ (ON MONITOR)
          Soon.

     Another AGENT peers out a window through binoculars.

     HIS POV: THE EXTERIOR OF THE OFFICE WHERE CASTRO, GORDON, 
     AND RUIZ TALK.

     EXT. DEL MAR SELF-STORAGE, SAN DIEGO - DAY

     A BLUE VAN makes a slow turn into the parking lot.

     roof.  They look through high-powered binoculars.  Binocular

     POV: THE BLUE VAN TURNING INTO THE PLAZA.

                    FBI AGENT #2
          All right, here we go.  The blue 
          van.

     HIS BINOCULAR POV DETECTS THREE UNMARKED CARS DISCREETLY 
     FOLLOWING THE VAN.

                    FBI AGENT #2
          Three unmarked vehicles.
               (picks up walkie)
          Three unmarked vehicles accompanying.

     The unmarked cars split up and one turns into the parking 
     lot of a fast-food restaurant.  The other circles around the 
     back of a building.

                    FBI AGENT #2
          It's local.  Local or Customs.  Oh, 
          man, I don't know.  Looks like the 
          cavalry.

                    FBI AGENT
          This is our show.  Ah, man.  I don't 
          want to share this one.

     INT. OFFICE, DEL MAR SELF-STORAGE - CONTINUOUS

     Through the window Ruiz, Gordon and Castro watch the van 
     disappear into the bay of a storage unit.  A man is pulling 
     down the door behind it when three unmarked squad cars ROAR 
     into the lot, surrounding the unit, officers exit the cars 
     with their guns drawn -- Gordon and Castro stare in disbelief.

     Ruiz FIRES the gun under the desk which hits Gordon full in 
     the chest, knocking him backwards.

     Ruiz's men run into the room pulling guns.

     Castro dives and pulls his weapon, firing at Ruiz's men, 
     hitting both of them.  Ruiz bolts through another door.  
     Castro pursues, talking into his shirt collar --

                    CASTRO
          Agent down.  Repeat, agent down.

     Gordon gets slowly to his feet, shaking off the blast to his 
     Kevlar, and runs after them.

     EXT. DEL MAR SELF-STORAGE - DAY

     The DEA are shooting at the men inside the storage unit who 
     are shooting back.

     From all over the stake-out location, DEA AGENTS emerge firing 
     their weapons.  An equal number of FBI AGENTS emerge firing 
     in return.  Nobody was aware of the other's presence.

     It's CHAOS, a clusterfuck of law-enforcement zeal with three 
     competing sets of good guys shouting through BULL-HORNS, 
     GUNSHOTS and SCREAMING.

     Ruiz breaks through the corner of the lot, cutting between 
     two buildings.  Castro emerges and chases him.

     EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

     Ruiz runs out the back of the storage company.  He cuts 
     between parked cars, heading for The Fun Zone, a kiddie 
     restaurant.

     INT. THE FUN ZONE - DAY

     Castro enters The Fun Zone.  There's a cardboard cutout of 
     SPASTIC JACK, a beloved comedy figure who looks like a rabbit 
     version of Jar Jar Binks, promoting the "Special Edition" 
     glass: "Collect All Four."  There's an enclosure filled with 
     colored plastic balls.

     The restaurant is empty except for a CLOWN filling out a 
     time card.  The clown stands.

                    CLOWN
          Hey dudes, we're not open yet.

     Castro makes a motion for him to be quiet and keeps moving 
     toward the room of colored balls.

     Gordon enters the restaurant and follows him.  An ANIMATRONIC 
     BAND starts to play a SONG.

     Gordon sees a half-hidden foot buried underneath the plastic 
     balls at the far end of the room.

     He takes careful aim and FIRES.

     Ruiz SCREAMS and sits up.  Castro pounces on him, disarming 
     him, and roughing him up.

     EXT. THE FUN ZONE - DAY

     Castro and Gordon shove Ruiz into the sunlight.  They wait 
     while their eyes adjust.

                    RUIZ
          Take me to the hospital.  I'm bleeding 
          to death.

     Castro shoves him forward.

     ACROSS THE PARKING LOT

     DEA has opened the back of the van where a quarter-ton of 
     cocaine is spilling out onto the pavement.

     INT. GUEST HOUSE - AFTERNOON

     A bong hit is expelled into the air.  In the living room of 
     a comfortable, preppy guest house, private school TEENAGERS 
     party and hang-out: cigarettes in ashtrays, beer and bong on 
     the coffee table, loud MUSIC.

     SUPERTITLE: CINCINNATI, OHIO

     The TV is on with the sound off.  The curtains are closed.

     The four boys wear school blazers with their ties pulled 
     askew, the three girls' clothing are also identical.  Some 
     sit on couches, some on the floor.  They are stoned.

     One intense-looking boy, SETH ABRAHAMS, 17, wild curly hair 
     and the attitude of a young Coleridge, and a girl, CAROLINE 
     WAKEFIELD, 16, really sixteen which means she looks about 
     12, pretty and flirtatiously irreverent, sit at a desk in 
     front of a Powerbook G-3 playing an on-line trivia game.

     Seth speaks rapidly and precisely.

                    SETH
          Father of Greek tragedy?  Anyone?
          Okay, Aeschylus it is.
               (hits keys)
          His trilogy?  The Oresteia.  I mean 
          this is beautiful, can anyone stop 
          the Seth Machine?
               (hits keys)
          Score.  Thank you.  Madmax from Omaha 
          we own you.  And Tragedy is closed 
          out.

     Seth leans over and snorts a line of coke from a mirror.  He 
     hands it to Caroline who effortlessly does one.

                    CAROLINE
          Entertainment.  The Susan Lucci 
          section or Banal Love Songs of the 
          Nineties?

     Seth looks at her.  He has a crush.

                    SETH
          Banal Love Songs it is.
               (hits keys)
          Hey, you wanna try something?

     She nods.  They both take a swig of beer.  He takes her hand 
     pulling her past the stoned people on the couch --

     IN THE KITCHEN

     Seth takes out a box of baking soda.  He tears off a square 
     of aluminum foil.  He takes out a spoon.  Caroline watches 
     as he dumps a small amount of cocaine into the spoon.  He 
     adds a pinch of baking soda.  He puts in a few drops of water.  
     Stirs it around with the heel of a lighter.  Then holds the 
     flame under the spoon.

                    CAROLINE
          What are you doing?

                    SETH
               (concentrating)
          Just watch.

     He watches the substance in the spoon as it swirls and 
     bubbles, then separates... He pours the most viscous part 
     onto the aluminum foil, making four separate little puddles.

     He quickly dismantles a ballpoint pen, making a straw.  He 
     hands it to Caroline.

                    SETH
          Inhale the smoke and hold it.

                    CAROLINE
          What is this, like freebase?

                    SETH
          Not like.  It is.

     He lights the flame under the aluminum foil.  The puddle 
     crackles and pops, then starts to smoke --

                    SETH
          Go...  Go!

     There's a rush of thick grey smoke.  Caroline catches most 
     of it.

                    SETH
          Hold it.

     She pulls it in deeper and holds... Suddenly her expression 
     changes... Her eyes lose their focus, her face slackens, an 
     almost sexual response.  Seth is watching her intensely.

                    SETH
          See... Now, you see.

     Caroline slumps back against the counter.  Seth moves against 
     her, kissing her, running his hands over her breasts and 
     body.  She stares over his shoulder, holding it as long as 
     she can.

     Finally she exhales --

                    CAROLINE
          More.

     The cloud of grey smoke from her lungs fills the room.

     INT. WHITE HOUSE OFFICE - DAY

     The White House CHIEF OF STAFF meets with Robert Wakefield.  
     The Chief of Staff has the floor; he always has the floor.

     This is a man you do not want to disappoint.

                    CHIEF OF STAFF
          Until you officially take over the 
          office of National Drug Control 
          Policy, under no circumstances should 
          you speak to the press unprotected, 
          without going through this office or 
          having someone in the room.  There 
          are a lot of interests in this town 
          and, right now, they're all scared 
          of you.  The reason they're scared 
          of you...technically, you have veto 
          power over their budgets.  So think 
          about that: FBI, CIA, DEA, CUSTOMS, 
          TREASURY, ATF, DEFENSE, IRS, Radio 
          Shack and the DMV, they're all gonna 
          want to speak to you.  And that's 
          the good news... You'll also be 
          meeting Senators and Congressman, 
          each with a specially prepared 
          question.  Their question is designed 
          for one thing: to make them look 
          smart.  If you lecture them, they 
          won't think you respect them.  If 
          you respond with utter humility, 
          they will.  Remember, this is about 
          your respect for them, and the 
          President's respect for them.  
          Speaking of which, as soon as he 
          gets back from Russia and China, 
          we'll get you in there for some face-
          time, let the two of you catch up.
               (beat)
          It'd probably be a good idea for you 
          to meet your predecessor.  I'll have 
          Jeff Sheridan take you over.
          Also, four weeks from today you will 
          give your first official press 
          conference.  In it you will outline 
          the President's strategy for winning 
          the war on drugs.
               (beat)
          Okay, anything else?

                    ROBERT
          I'll be sure to let you know.

     INT. EXECUTIVE BUILDING, WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY

     Robert makes his way through a warren of hallways in the 
     endless corridors of the Old Executive Building alongside 
     JEFF SHERIDAN, 35, an enthusiastic government employee who 
     has found his place.

                    SHERIDAN
          I just want to be clear about one 
          thing.  I used to work for him, but 
          now I work for you.  I'm not a 
          partisan person, I'm an issue person.  
          In the next few weeks, if you allow 
          me, we'll get you well-versed on an 
          incredible array of issues.  The 
          most important of which, in my 
          opinion, being Mexico.  I know 
          everybody that you're gonna meet.
          It's important that they like you.
          It's not important that they like 
          me.  That's why I can help protect 
          you.

                    ROBERT
          Like you protected Landry?

                    SHERIDAN
          I see where you're going with that, 
          but if I could just say something, 
          which is basically that a guy like 
          Landry is so autocratic he doesn't 
          know how to let himself be helped; 
          it's a point of pride to take every 
          bullet, no matter who fired it, or 
          whether it was even aimed at him, 
          which personally I think it very 
          self-defeating.  Now, don't get me 
          wrong, he's a man of enormous 
          integrity, but there's a political 
          component to this job that the General 
          just didn't have any patience for.

     INT. OFFICE OF NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL POLICY - DAY

     Robert and Sheridan enter the office of outgoing Drug Czar, 
     GENERAL RALPH LANDRY, 60's, buzz-cut, professional soldier 
     with a sense of humor.

     Landry is putting some personal items in a box.

                    GENERAL LANDRY
          Jeff, you want to excuse us for a 
          minute?

     Sheridan nods and leaves.

                    GENERAL LANDRY
               (bemused, off 
               Sheridan's exit)
          Functionaries.  Nice people, the 
          Schedule C's.  About twelve graduate 
          degrees apiece, but it seems sometimes 
          all they do is start rumors.

     Robert and Landry shake hands.

                    ROBERT
          You've done a fine job here, Sir.
          The Office of National Drug Control 
          Policy is in better shape than when 
          you found it.

     Landry tries to determine whether Robert believes this.  He 
     looks around the office as if the policy is hiding somewhere.

                    GENERAL LANDRY
          I'm not sure I made the slightest 
          difference.
               (wistful)
          I tried...  I really did.

                    ROBERT
          There are a lot of encouraging 
          statistics.  The work's just started, 
          but I intend to see it through.  
          You've got my word on that.

                    GENERAL LANDRY
          You're here for two years, three 
          maximum.  What'd they promise you?
          Court appointment?  What?  District?
          Appeals?
               (checks Robert's 
               reaction)
          Not Supreme... Supreme?

                    ROBERT
          I've come in to do a tough job and 
          that's what I'm going to focus on.

     General Landry SIGHS.

                    GENERAL LANDRY
          When Kruschev was forced out, he sat 
          down and wrote two letters and handed 
          them to his successor.  He said "When 
          you get into a situation you can't 
          get out of, open the first letter 
          and you'll be saved.  And when you 
          get into another situation you can't 
          get out of, open the second."  Soon 
          enough this guy found himself in a 
          tight place.  So he opened the first 
          letter.  It said, "Blame everything 
          on me."  So he blamed the old guy 
          and it worked like a charm.
               (beat)
          He got into another situation he 
          couldn't get out of, so he opened 
          the second letter, which read, "Sit 
          down and write two letters."

     They stare at each other a beat.  Then Landry smiles.

     EXT. MANOLO'S STREET, MEXICO - DAY

     A cinderblock house.  Kids and dogs in the street.  A face 
     we recognize as Manolo's peers out of a curtain into the 
     street.

     INT. MANOLO'S KITCHEN - DAY

     The ceiling is stained, the floor sags.  A cheap radio plays.  
     Manolo is at the door.  Javi sits at a dinette table.

     He talks to Manolo but watches Manolo's wife, ANNA, 20's, a 
     nice-looking, ostensibly demure young woman, as she moves 
     around the kitchen.

                    JAVIER
          Relax.  If they were going to kill 
          us they would have done it in the 
          desert.

                    MANOLO
          They wouldn't do it in front of all 
          these people.  They'd send someone 
          later, when we're alone.

     Manolo tenses, and throws open the window.

                    MANOLO
               (yelling out the window)
          Away from the car.  Now!

     MANOLO'S POV out the window as KIDS play in the car, sitting 
     behind the wheel.

                    JAVIER
          Even if that were true, they're not 
          going to come to your house where 
          you're waiting for them.

                    ANNA
          He's right.  They'll do it when you're 
          walking somewhere, make it look like 
          street crime.

                    MANOLO
          Shut your fucking mouth.  Nobody's 
          talking to you.

     Anna sets a cup of coffee in front of Javi and stares at 
     him.

     INT. POLICE SEDAN - DAY

     Javi and Manolo cruise through the streets of Tijuana.

                    JAVIER
          If you want her to stay out of it, 
          then stop telling her everything.
          You should learn how to keep a secret.

                    MANOLO
          She's nosy.  She hears me on the 
          telephone.

                    JAVIER
          Anyway, I don't think we'll ever see 
          them again.  Everything's back to 
          normal.

     EXT. TIJUANA STREET - DAY

     Tourist hell.  A cacophony of street venders, panhandlers, 
     and vehicular traffic.  Javier and Manolo are speaking with 
     a flustered young American TOURIST COUPLE.

                    TOURIST WOMAN
          You're a police officer.  Aren't you 
          going to take a report or something?  
          Don't you want to know what kind of 
          car it is?

                    TOURIST MAN
          It's a Brown Ford Explorer --

                    TOURIST WOMAN
          It was right here.  It's been stolen.  
          I want to file a report.

                    MANOLO
          Please.  Filing a report will not 
          help you find your car.

                    JAVIER
          The police won't find your car.

                    TOURIST WOMAN
          But you're the police.

     Javier pulls out a note pad and scribbles a number.

                    JAVIER
          Call this man, he'll find your car 
          for you.

                    TOURIST MAN
          I don't get it --

                    TOURIST WOMAN
          How will this guy know who has our 
          car?

                    JAVIER
          The police will tell him.

     There's a beat of confusion.

                    TOURIST MAN
          Why will they tell him but they won't 
          tell us?

                    TOURIST WOMAN
               (getting it)
          Because we pay him, stupid.
               (to Javier)
          Right?  And he pays the police.

     And then our car appears.

                    JAVIER
          Yes.  Better than filling out forms, 
          right?

     The man reaches in his wallet and offers Javier a twenty.  
     Javi waves him off.

     Javier and Manolo walk back to their squad car when two SUV's 
     come to a stop in front of them.

     Javier and Manolo exchange a look.  The doors SLAM and 
     FOOTSTEPS approach.

                    OFFICER (O.S.)
          Javier Rodriguez.

     EXT. LA JOLLA GOLF AND TENNIS CLUB - DAY

     A ladies luncheon in the Nancy Reagan Dining Room overlooking 
     a putting green.  The bejewelled WIVES of successful men 
     yammer at one another around tables with rich flower 
     centerpieces.

     SUPERTITLE: LA JOLLA, CALIFORNIA, JUST OUTSIDE SAN DIEGO

     One wife, HELENA AYALA, 32, ex-model, with a sweetness and 
     intelligence that almost contradicts her beauty, stares out 
     the window at a small BOY, 5, using a putter as tall as he 
     is.  Helena is six months pregnant and radiant.

     A waiter brings Helena's starter course.  Her friends, NAN 
     DOBBS, early 40's, post Junior League, a little tipsy,

     STEWIE and ALEX, same League, watch her --

                    NAN
          Duck salad?

                    HELENA
          Mmm.

     Nan can't believe it.

                    NAN
          Helena, you never order duck salad.

                    HELENA
          Well, that's true.  I don't.
               (re: her belly)
          I think someone else is asking for 
          it.

                    NAN
          Well, he's got good taste.  Isn't it 
          the most wonderful thing you ever 
          tasted?  I mean ever.

                    HELENA
          It's delicious --

                    STEWIE
          They're the most marvelous little 
          creatures.  Canard.  They fly, swim, 
          walk.  And so cute with their babies 
          marching along behind.

                    NAN
          Looking for a nice sauce ala orange.

     Everyone laughs.  Helena is by far the youngest in her crowd.

                    ALEX
          It's a very fatty bird.  All that 
          winter insulation.  Just like me.

                    NAN
          You mean all breast, just like you.

                    ALEX
          You're bad --

                    NAN
               (singsong)
          Jealous, that's all --

                    HELENA
          I've heard... I can't remember 
          where... That it's full of that good 
          kind of fat, the kind you're
          supposed to eat --

                    STEWIE
          Unsaturated fat --

                    TWO WOMEN IN UNISON
          Polyunsaturated.

                    HELENA
          And now there's a good cholesterol 
          and bad cholesterol.  Everything 
          they tell you completely changes 
          every other week.  I don't know why 
          they think we should listen at all.

                    NAN
          What I know is ducks, as cute as 
          they are, were designed by God to be 
          eaten.

     Nan reaches for a taste and the other women lean forward 
     also, a sea of inanity swirling around Helena's salad.

     EXT. COUNTRY CLUB PARKING LOT - DAY

     Helena buckles her little boy, DAVID, 5, into the front seat 
     of her Mercedes.  He won't let go of his putter.

                    HELENA
          I'll put this in the back.

                    DAVID
          No --

                    HELENA
          All the professionals keep them in 
          the trunk.

                    DAVID
          Not Tiger Woods.

                    HELENA
          Especially Tiger Woods.
               (sharing a secret)
          ...Actually, he keeps his on the 
          back seat.

     She pulls the putter away from the reluctant boy and sets it 
     on the back seat.

     EXT. HOTEL - DAY

     A modern high-rise on the waterfront playground of San Diego.

     Helena passes the hotel in her car.

     INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

     A standard room looking out at the water which is dotted 
     with sailboats and cruise ships.  The bed is covered with hi-
     tech surveillance equipment.

     The equipment salesman, LONNIE, 40's, who makes a fetish of 
     gadgetry, explains the finer points of operation to FRANCISCO 
     "FRANKIE" FLORES, 30's, sallow, watery-eyed, in expensive 
     clothes.

                    LONNIE
          Gates, Myrhvold, Bezos.  I sell to 
          all those guys.  Why?  Because the 
          technology to intrude has reached 
          the masses.  Your competitor, your 
          ex-spouse, adversaries, stalkers, 
          they're at the local electronics 
          store right now, and they're gonna 
          be intruding on you not only through 
          your telephone, but your fax, cell 
          phone, pager, cable TV, Musak, 
          windows, walls, air conditioning 
          ventilation, modem, and internet 
          connection.

     He walks over to the bed and the sexy equipment --

                    LONNIE
          Nobody has these babies, no way, not 
          the shiznit.

     Frederico picks up a piece of equipment.

                    FRANCISCO
          I want to intercept cell phone calls, 
          digital and analog.  And locate the 
          source of the call.  I need databasing 
          capability, to cross-reference calls 
          and numbers.

     Lonnie lovingly picks up a laptop computer with a sleek device 
     attached to it --

                    LONNIE
          Your Cellular Secretary, friend across 
          all the digital wireless spread 
          spectrum.
               (beat)
          So, Francisco, what do you do?  You 
          a PI?  Private security?

     Francisco looks at Lonnie coldly.

                    FRANCISCO
          Assassin.

                    LONNIE
               (not missing a beat)
          Assassin, okay.  Let's get you started 
          in surveillance.

     EXT. GEORGETOWN BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

     The house takes up most of one of the nicest blocks.  PEOPLE 
     enter and party VOICES drift out.

     SUPERTITLE: GEORGETOWN, WASHINGTON, D.C.

     INT. GEORGETOWN BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

     A power cocktail party in full swing.  This is where most of 
     the business in Washington gets done.

     Robert, scotch in hand, listens to a smug PHARMACEUTICAL 
     LOBBYIST explain the world.

                    PHARMACEUTICAL LOBBYIST
          We in the legal drug business, and I 
          mean Merck, Pfizer, the rest of my 
          very powerful clients, realize this 
          isn't a war with a traditional winner 
          and loser, but an organism at war 
          with itself, whose weapons of mass 
          destruction happen to be intoxicants.  
          And if you want a body count look no 
          further than alcohol which racks up 
          80,000 kills a year.  Cocaine manages 
          a measly 2,000.  Same for Heroin.  
          But, the big daddy is Big Tobacco 
          which kills 380,000 each year, which, 
          by the way, is more people than have 
          been killed by all the illegal drugs 
          in the last century.

                    ROBERT
               (faking it)
          That's very interesting.

     The lobbyist smiles.  Robert sips his drink.

     ANOTHER ANGLE ON ROBERT

     In another room.  Listening to STAN, overweight advocate for 
     the United States Council of Chambers of Commerce.

                    STAN
          It's time, Robert, to choke some 
          honesty out of these rural 
          legislators; get'em to fess up that 
          it's pretty much Prisons or Casinos 
          in terms of their choices for economic 
          growth.

     ANOTHER ANGLE ON ROBERT

     listening to ETHAN, earnest advocate of harm reduction.

                    ETHAN
          What's the difference between Prozac 
          and Ecstacy, you ask?  One's a 
          mattress and the other's a trampoline.  
          Molecules don't have morality.  
          Really, think about it: some molecule 
          changes the way a serotonin re-uptake 
          inhibitor works, it's not suddenly a 
          bad molecule; it's just a molecule.  
          My theory: America has a real fear 
          of short, intense experiences.

     Robert turns away --

                    ROBERT
               (under his breath)
          Like you.

                    ANOTHER ROOM
          Robert at the bar getting another 
          scotch.  A secretive man, TIM, 40's, 
          nerdy, sidles up beside him and 
          whispers furtively in his ear.

                    TIM
               (whispering)
          Chemicals?  Some say problems, others 
          say solution.  Imagine a cloud that 
          when it rains prohibits the growth 
          of poppies or takes the THC out of 
          marijuana.  Imagine a pill that 
          eliminates any psychological craving, 
          from Dilaudid to Dove Bars.  Law 
          enforcement hasn't let science sit 
          on the sidelines.  Addiction is no 
          more relevant than polio or the Black 
          Plague.

     Tim slips away into the crowd.  Robert moves away from the 
     bar.

     ANOTHER ROOM

     An argument is breaking out between an ECONOMIST and an 
     UNDERSECRETARY OF DEFENSE with Robert as the audience.

                    ECONOMIST
               (to the undersecretary)
          You're not battling traffickers or 
          dealers, but a market, and the market 
          contains a paradox: if you arrest 
          traffickers, you raise prices, and 
          you also raise profits, which brings 
          more traffickers into the business.

                    UNDERSECRETARY
               (to the Economist)
          Back in the real world, we're talking 
          about Mexico and not John Maynard 
          Keynes.  We will spend 18 billion 
          dollars this year on this "war," and 
          the question on the table every year 
          is do we certify Mexico as an ally 
          or not?

     Another man, RUSH PHILLIPS, a middle-aged powerbroker, 
     overhears, then joins and Robert is encircled.

                    RUSH PHILLIPS
          You want to make a difference, hit 
          the users. You don't jeopardize our 
          financial markets by some hypocritical 
          stance on drug consumption.  We're 
          snorting it, why penalize Mexico for 
          supplying it?

                    UNDERSECRETARY
          Mexico, don't talk to me about
          Mexico --

                    ECONOMIST
          It's the stick of law enforcement 
          that creates the carrot of huge
          profits... That's economic truth --

                    RUSH PHILLIPS
          Addicts don't vote; they don't have 
          PACs; they don't spend soft money,
          that's political truth --

                    UNDERSECRETARY
          We're locking them up and
          consumption is falling --

                    ECONOMIST
          The price of coke and heroin has 
          dropped and purity has increased.
          All this law enforcement has achieved 
          is kids can get better stuff, cheaper.  
          In economic terms, you can forget 
          it; this is not a winnable war.

                    RUSH PHILLIPS
          Christ, you want to decertify 
          somebody, take Pakistan or Columbia.
          We don't need them for anything.

                    ECONOMIST
          If you manage to seize an 
          inconceivable 50 percent of all drugs 
          coming into this country, you'll 
          still raise the price of coke and 
          heroin less than 3 percent which 
          won't affect drug use at all.

                    RUSH PHILLIPS
          Why are we calling this a war at 
          all?  You don't declare war on your 
          own people.  Addiction is a little 
          worm that gnaws a house apart from 
          the inside.

     MICHAEL ADLER, about Robert's age, and as successful, but in 
     a different way, approaches, catching Robert's eye through 
     the arguing demagogues.

                    UNDERSECRETARY
          We need Mexico for these reasons:
          number one -- Defense; two -- Trade; 
          three -- Tourism; then, way on down 
          the line, comes Drugs.  The President 
          knows this.  Why's he holding 
          everybody's feet to the fire?

                    MICHAEL
               (solemn)
          Mr. Wakefield, there's a situation 
          that needs your attention right away.

     Robert looks at Michael, squints, looks closer, then follows.

                    RUSH PHILLIPS
               (oblivious)
          One in sixteen Americans is of Mexican 
          descent.  Mexico our third largest 
          trading partner...

     ANGLE ON ROBERT AND MICHAEL ON THE BACK PORCH.

                    ROBERT
          You're looking pretty good for an 
          old guy.

                    MICHAEL
          My work keeps me young.

                    ROBERT
          Which part, getting terrorists loose 
          on bail or freeing convicted murderers 
          on technicalities?

                    MICHAEL
          The worst serial killer in history -
          who?  Gacy - right?  Killed forty 
          two people.  Our government killed 
          fifty thousand in Vietnam and lied 
          about it every day.

                    ROBERT
          Michael, you represent drug dealers, 
          not civil libertarians.

                    MICHAEL
          We kidnapped Noriega out of Panama.
          Is that covered in your Constitution?
          Because it isn't in mine.

                    ROBERT
          Noriega is a criminal.

                    MICHAEL
          Noriega was head of a sovereign nation 
          who made the mistake of doing business 
          with the U.S.  Government.  So, no, 
          I don't have a problem waking up 
          every day and fighting our government, 
          fighting people like you, trying to 
          keep this system a little bit honest.

                    ROBERT
               (amused)
          Last I read your clients were chopping 
          people up with chainsaws and 
          delivering illegal narcotics into 
          this country.

                    MICHAEL
          I hope when you were on the bench, 
          Judge Wakefield, you didn't handle 
          the presumption of innocence in the 
          same fashion.

                    ROBERT
          If I ever return to the bench, 
          Counselor Adler, I hope I have the 
          pleasure of hearing your arguments.

     INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM, SAN DIEGO - DAY

     Eduardo Ruiz lies in a hospital bed, handcuffed to the 
     railing.  His bandaged foot is held aloft by a sling and a 
     tube drains the wound.  He is tugging on the handcuffs as 
     Castro and Gordon enter the room.

                    GORDON
          You planning on going somewhere, 
          Eduardo?  You don't like it here?
          This is the best situation you're 
          going to have for a long, long time.

                    RUIZ
          I am a legitimate business.  Fishing 
          boats.  Tuna.  Check it out.  Tax 
          records, everything --

                    GORDON
          Listen you motherfucker, you tried 
          to kill me with a fucking cannon.

                    RUIZ
          You can't visit me here.  I want my 
          lawyer.

                    GORDON
          The amount of coke we got on you 
          means capital punishment in some 
          states.

                    CASTRO
          Move 'em to Texas, fry 'em up.

                    GORDON
          We got you on tape making the deal.
          We got you bragging about the quality.  
          We got you bragging about your 
          business.  We got you.

     A NURSE appears in the doorway.  Gordon goes to the door and 
     shuts it in her face.

                    GORDON
          One chance here, Eduardo.  Make us 
          believe you got a boss.  No boss, 
          it's all on you.

                    RUIZ
          It's a death sentence.  I'll never 
          make it to the trial.

                    GORDON
          We can protect you.

     Ruiz looks at them in disbelief.

                    CASTRO
          Who do you work for?

                    RUIZ
          This is coercion.

                    GORDON
          That's a big word for a fisherman.

                    CASTRO
          Who do you work for?

     Gordon and Ruiz stare at each other.

                    RUIZ
          I know another word... Immunity.

     EXT. AYALA HOME - LA JOLLA - DAY

     A starter castle high in the hills near Mount Soledad, an 
     exclusive neighborhood with views of the ocean.  Joggers jog 
     to the SOUNDS of tennis and Jacuzzis gurgling, and lawn care 
     equipment operated by Mexicans.

     Behind the Ayala gate we see David playing with his golf 
     club on the lush lawn.

     Workers set-up the party under the direction of a professional 
     party planner.

     A BMW 740il with tinted windows pulls into the driveway.

                    DAVID
          Daddy!

     The window lowers and we see CARL AYALA, 40's, handsome, 
     charismatic, second generation American, in expensive, 
     conservative clothes, covering his cell phone as he greets 
     his kids.

                    CARL
          Hello.  Hello.

     He goes back to his phone call, pulling around to the garage.  
     David goes back to his game.

     INT. AYALA DINING ROOM - DAY

     There are MAIDS in the house and a COOK in the kitchen.  The 
     large rooms are filled with fine art.

     Helena Ayala sits at the dining room table with plans, bills 
     and receipts spread before her.  Carl enters and paces around 
     the room, continuing his cell phone conversation.

                    CARL
               (into phone)
          I'm sorry, Jonas.  I don't care if 
          that is the price you have gotten in 
          order countries.

     Helena watches her husband pace as he talks.  He can't help 
     it, but a portion of this call is theatrical, for an 
     audience's benefit, which in this instance happens to be his 
     wife.  Helena's expression of annoyance resets itself into 
     love.

                    CARL
          This is America, a different country.  
          I am Carl, a different man.  So you 
          see, everything about our situation 
          is different and I believe the pricing 
          will be different, too.
               (beat, listens)
          You're a reasonable man... So take 
          the weekend to think about it.

     Carl clicks off the phone, turns to Helena.

                    CARL
          Every day with this guy is like 
          starting all over again.

     Carl winds down and finally becomes present in the room with 
     his wife.  He looks at her.  She looks back.

                    CARL
          Hi.

                    HELENA
          Hi.

                    CARL
          What's up?

                    HELENA
          Just watching you.

                    CARL
          I got that.  How was your day?

     She pushes the topiary away from her.  Suddenly, she seems 
     tired.  Carl comes over and puts his hand on her pregnant 
     belly.

                    CARL
          You all right?

                    HELENA
          I keep feeling like I'm forgetting 
          something.

     Her husband watches her, then wraps his arms around her.

     EXT. AYALA HOME - DAY

     Carl and Helena step out on the front porch of their home 
     and watch David play with his golf putter.

     OUTSIDE THEIR GATE

     An unmarked police car rolls up and stops behind the wall.  
     Another arrives and another and another.  OFFICERS in DEA 
     jackets exit the cars.

     There is MURMURING, then SILENCE.

     Helena slowly turns to look at her husband.  He doesn't look 
     at her.

                    HELENA
          David, come inside --

     Suddenly, POLICE and DEA enter the front yard.  Gordon and 
     Castro enter the yard and move quickly up the drive to Carl.

                    CARL
          What is this?  What is going on?

                    GORDON
          Mr. Ayala?

                    CARL
          That's right.

                    GORDON
          You're under arrest for violation of 
          Federal Narcotics laws.

     Gordon and Castro spin him, cuff him, and without emotion 
     begin pulling him from his yard.  David is trying to get to 
     his father.  In a kind of shock.  Helena trails after him.

     Castro drags Carl into the street toward the open door of 
     the cruiser.  He pushes him down into the backseat.

                    GORDON
          We have a warrant to search your 
          home, Mrs. Ayala.

     Gordon hits the side of the cruiser and it pulls away.  Carl 
     looks at his wife through the window.

     Gordon and Castro head up the driveway toward her house.

     Helena is left standing in the street.  NEIGHBORS, who have 
     appeared in front yards and at the ends of driveways, stare 
     at her with suspicion.  David approaches and holds onto her 
     leg.

     INT. SALAZAR'S HEADQUARTERS - ANTEROOM - DAY

     Javi and Manolo wait in Salazar's anteroom.  A ceiling fan 
     swirls the air.  After a moment the door opens and an AIDE 
     motions to them.  They stand.

                    AIDE
               (to Manolo)
          Not you.  You.

     Javi goes into the room.

     INT. SALAZAR'S OFFICE - DAY

     The office is Spartan and military.  Salazar and Javi sit 
     facing each other.  Salazar looks at a piece of paper.

                    SALAZAR
          Javier Rodriguez.  Twenty-nine years-
          old.  Graduated from Montessori 
          school.  Five years as a beat cop in 
          TJ.  Three years with the State 
          Police.  Parents died four years ago 
          in their apartment from carbon 
          monoxide poisoning because they could 
          not afford to fix their gas heater.  
          Your sister works in a Maquiladora 
          in Juarez, making designer blue-jeans.  
          On the police force three years, you 
          currently make 316 dollars a month.

     Salazar crumples the piece of paper and tosses it in the 
     trash.

                    SALAZAR
          That's your past.  I want to talk 
          about your future.  Would you be 
          willing to do something for me?

                    JAVIER
          If I can.

                    SALAZAR
          I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.

                    JAVIER
          What is it you want me to do?

                    SALAZAR
          A small thing.  Nothing really.

     Javier thinks about this.

                    JAVIER
          Does this offer include my partner?

                    SALAZAR
          Only if he can be trusted.

                    JAVIER
          He'll do what I say.

     Salazar slides a folder across the desk.  Javier opens it 
     and sees a black and white surveillance photo of the 
     informant.

                    SALAZAR
          His name is Francisco Flores.  He is 
          a killer and gun smuggler for the 
          Tijuana cartel.  I need to speak 
          with him.  I need you to find him 
          and bring him to me so that I can 
          speak with him.

     INT. POLICE SEDAN - DAY

     Manolo faces Javier.

                    MANOLO
          This is fucking crazy.  Instead of 
          killing us, he sends us on a suicide 
          mission.  Do you know who Frankie 
          Flowers is?  He's a psycho-cokehead-
          hitman.  A faggot.  He's killed 
          fucking who knows how many people.  
          You'd need half the force to get 
          close to him.  And you can't get 
          their help because he lives in fucking 
          San Diego.

                    JAVIER
          Then I guess I'm going by myself.

     INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

     Robert Wakefield sits in business class.  He twists the cap 
     off a mini-bottle of bourbon and pours it over a cup of ice.  
     He empties a second bottle into the cup, then swirls it around 
     on the ice.  He takes a sip.

     INT. AIRPORT GATE - DAY

     Robert exits with his briefcase and hanging bag, two SECURITY 
     MEN trailing him.  He sees Barbara and Caroline, his wife 
     and daughter, waiting by the their station wagon.  They wave.

     INT. CAR - DAY

     On the way home from the airport.  Caroline drives carefully 
     with Barbara in the front seat and Robert in back.

                    ROBERT
          What's it like?
               (thinks)
          Imagine you're being accosted by a 
          swarm of beggars in the heart of 
          Calcutta, except the beggars are 
          wearing $1500 suits and they don't 
          say "please" or "thank you."

                    CAROLINE
          What about legalizing everything?
          Has anybody talked about that?

                    ROBERT
          Fine -- legalization.  Okay, 
          forgetting all of our international 
          trade agreements, legalize everything 
          today.  The Government inserts itself 
          into all drug transactions.  The 
          U.S. becomes a giant pharmacy.  Our 
          borders are mobbed, lines of people 
          from here to Europe wanting to smoke, 
          snort and shoot themselves into 
          oblivion.

                    BARBARA
               (lightly)
          Like a Grateful Dead Concert.

                    ROBERT
          Drugs begin pouring out of America 
          into every other country in the world.  
          Canada is completely overwhelmed.

                    CAROLINE
          What if every country legalized at 
          the same time?

                    ROBERT
               (smiles)
          Somehow, I don't see that happening.

     INT. WAKEFIELD DINING ROOM - EVENING

     From the hallway we see Robert and Barbara and Caroline having 
     dinner.  A family tableau.  We hear Barbara talking, the 
     murmur of the days events.

     In the room, Barbara continues her dinner table thoughts.

     Robert has a good deal of reading material stacked on the 
     table.

                    BARBARA
          So you know we put the case before 
          the arbitration panel, none of whom 
          had any expertise.  Superfund is 
          just one of those words.  People 
          stop paying attention.

                    ROBERT
          That's frustrating.

                    BARBARA
          It's so frustrating.

     There is wine on the table and Caroline is allowed a glass.

     Her parents watch her take a responsible sip.

                    CAROLINE
               (to Robert)
          Did you meet the President?

                    BARBARA
          Honey, your father knows the 
          President.

                    ROBERT
          As it happens, the President of the 
          United States, my new boss, the leader 
          of the free world, has me penciled 
          in for some "face time".

                    CAROLINE
          Will we get invited to the White 
          House?

                    ROBERT
          I don't know.

                    CAROLINE
          How long's the job?

                    ROBERT
          It's a presidential appointment so... 
          until I quit or get fired.

                    BARBARA
          Czar for life, just like a real czar.

                    CAROLINE
          That makes mom the Czarina.  I'm a 
          Czarette.  Like Anastasia.

     Caroline thinks about this.

                    CAROLINE
          None of my friends can fucking believe 
          my dad is the actual Drug Czar.

                    BARBARA
          Caroline --

                    CAROLINE
          Sorry, but I mean, come on.

     Robert doesn't know if she's putting him down.

                    CAROLINE
          It's great, daddy.  It's just amazing, 
          that's all.

     INT. SAN DIEGO JAIL - DAY

     In the intake area of a busy San Diego precinct, Helena sits 
     on a bench and regroups.  Detectives move past her.  
     Handcuffed criminals are separated, bagged and tagged.

     beautifully dressed man, ARNIE METZGER, 30's, super- lawyer, 
     knows everyone from the top of the system to the bottom, 
     slick but likable, smart and ruthless, too, separates himself 
     from a DETECTIVE he's gladhanding and approaches Helena.

                    ARNIE
          Helena, I'm so sorry --

                    HELENA
          Arnie, thank God.

     Metzger sits, giving her a hug.

                    HELENA
          Can you please tell me what on earth 
          is going on?

     Arnie looks at her as if to say, "do you really not know?"

     Then, he speaks quietly with his hand in front of his mouth.

                    ARNIE
          I understand.  You're upset.  You 
          want to know what's going on.  That's 
          good.

                    HELENA
          Why are you talking like that?

                    ARNIE
          Listen to me carefully.  First of 
          all, Carl isn't here.  DEA's got him 
          and they'll hang on to him until 
          arraignment, which will probably be 
          tomorrow.  So here you're wasting 
          your time.  Are you with me?

     He checks to see if this is registering.

                    ARNIE
          Good.  From now on I want you to 
          expect that every word you utter 
          will be tape-recorded, that the 
          movement of your lips is being read.
          Got it?

                    HELENA
          Arnie, this is crazy.

     He makes eye contact with her.

                    ARNIE
          Got it?
               (she slowly nods)
          Good.  Do not discuss anything over 
          the telephone.  Do not talk to the 
          neighbors.  Stay out of your yard.

                    HELENA
          What is he being charged with?

                    ARNIE
          I don't know, but under no 
          circumstances would I talk about it 
          here.  I want you to go home and 
          relax the best you can.  Continue 
          your life as if nothing has happened.
          That is very important.

                    HELENA
          Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping 
          through the looking glass.

                    ARNIE
          That's a very apt analogy, Helena.
          Now, go home and be with your 
          children.

     EXT. BUILDING PARKING LOT - DAY

     Helena exits.  Her expression is set as she drives.  She 
     turns a corner in the shopping district, passing JAVIER AND 
     MANOLO who are walking down the street.  Tourists, drunk 
     Marines and the homeless piss away another day.

     We follow them into a bar with blackened windows and a 
     discrete sign.

     INT. BAR - DAY

     This is a place where men come to meet men.  And it's already 
     lively even at this early hour.  Javier and Manolo find a 
     seat and wait.

                    LATER
          Javi is working on his second beer 
          when he seems to recognize somebody.

     ACROSS THE ROOM

     Francisco "Frankie" Flowers has entered the bar.  Javi watches 
     him circulate through the room then settle at the bar.  Javier 
     finishes his beer, rises, and takes the empty seat next to 
     Francisco.  Manolo watches.

     Very quickly Javi strikes up a conversation.  We don't hear 
     what they're saying but it doesn't matter because Francisco 
     clearly likes Javi.

     Off Francisco's anticipatory smile --

     Salazar's MEN drag Francisco away toward an abandoned mission-
     style building.

     With its old-growth trees and manipulated shrubbery, the 
     large house is shrouded in the mystery of well-heeled 
     suburbia.  It is very late.

     INT. SOMEBODY'S PARENTS' MANSION - NIGHT

     Somebody's parents are out of town and the house feels empty.  
     Big empty rooms with expensive furniture nobody sits on.

     Faint MUSIC echoes through the house.

     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

     High ceilings of a 1930's kitchen.  Vodka bottles and 
     cranberry juice and limes are spilled across a counter.  ON 
     THE RHODES AGAIN by Morcheeba plays from a jam-box on a 
     counter.

     Maybe ten TEENAGERS are partying hard in this kitchen.  It's 
     weird and disassociated, people wandering in and out, playing 
     with kitchen utensils, heavily fucked up.

     There are drugs on a mirror on the eat-in table.  Caroline 
     and Seth and two friends sit around this table.  VANESSA, 
     16, almost pretty, is hitting a freebase pipe and holds the 
     hit.  FUCKED-UP BOWMAN, 17, super-preppy with a wan, Baby 
     Huey face, takes a slug of vodka.

     They are jittery, sweaty, tweaked, fucked-up --

                    CAROLINE
          All I'm saying, what I'm saying, is 
          it never seems like anybody ever 
          says anything that matters to them, 
          like we all look at each other and 
          nod with responses we've been trained 
          to make, not real responses, just 
          social conventions, phony, fake 
          smiles, surface bullshit... I mean, 
          we're all smart and do we have any 
          idea what each other are like, really 
          like?  Do I know what Seth's afraid 
          of, or Vanessa, or fucked-up Bowman?

     Everyone looks at Fucked-up Bowman who grinds his jaw 
     appreciatively --

                    CAROLINE
          ...Probably, but do I ever say this 
          stuff, just say, "hey, I'm 
          uncomfortable in this crowd, I don't 
          know what the fuck I'm doing, either?  
          I know you're afraid and it's okay--
          "

     Seth's words come quickly, they're riffing, totally in sync, 
     totally wired --

          We act like we have all the answers 
          and we're totally invincible like 
          our parents seem and their parents 
          before them and it's fucking bullshit --

     Fucked-up Bowman takes another slug of vodka and almost pukes.

                    FUCKED-UP BOWMAN
          For instance --

                    SETH
          For instance I know you jack-off 
          thinking about Caroline even though 
          you're supposedly "in love" with 
          Vanessa.  Whatever the fuck that 
          means?
               (a digression)
          I mean, what is that convention, 
          anyway?  We're all these random 
          collections of self-interest, and 
          then we just decide that now we're
          two people walking along --

     Caroline expels a hit of rock cocaine --

                    CAROLINE
          And Vanessa doesn't think she's pretty 
          so she does all these weird fucking 
          diets which is totally about self-
          esteem.  And she's beautiful.
               (beat)
          And that's not even fair.  Because 
          listen to me.  I'm fucking lying 
          right now.  This is exactly what I'm 
          talking about... I'm supposedly 
          talking about you, making some big 
          point about you, and it's really 
          about me.  So I should talk about 
          me, not you, not even the universal 
          "you..."
               (takes a beat)
          Okay.  Okay, I'm worried I'm not 
          really smart or that I'm not nearly 
          as smart as people think I am, or 
          that my parents' expectations have

          I mean who knows they're going to 
          Harvard when they're five, not that 
          I'm blaming them for anything because 
          everything's great, and I may not 
          even get in, but we all feel this 
          shit and we never acknowledge it and 
          if we can't acknowledge it to the 
          people we care the most about then 
          who will we ever say it too and what 
          kind of life will that be?

     They all look at each other with love.  This is an adventure 
     and they're having a connection --

                    FUCKED-UP BOWMAN
          I jack-off thinking about Seth.

          Let's be different --

                    FUCKED-UP BOWMAN

     Bowman looks around, squinting, confused.  He's chalk white.

                    FUCKED-UP BOWMAN
          I'm serious --

     Suddenly, he clutches his chest and begins to twitch.  Puke 
     and foam come from his mouth.  He seizes and falls from the 
     chair.  Vanessa SCREAMS.

     Seth and Caroline push the table aside to get a better look.  
     Other people in the kitchen slowly take notice.

                    VANESSA
          He's blue.  He isn't breathing --

                    CAROLINE
          Is he breathing?

     Bowman's eyes have rolled back in his head.

                    SETH
          What do we do?  Okay.  Fucked-up 
          Bowman's turning blue.  Doctor.  We 
          need a doctor.

                    VANESSA

     INT. TORTURE ROOM - BARRACKS - DAY

     Francisco is strapped naked into a chair.  Duct tape covers 
     his mouth.  His face is bruised and swollen.  A cruel TORTURER 
     talks to him calmly while dumping chili powder into a 
     container of soda water.

                    TORTURER
          We know Tijuana Cartel gunmen killed 
          our chief of intelligence, Francisco.  
          We know you killed police commanders 
          in Tijuana and Mexico City.  Why do 
          you resist?

     He approaches Francisco and begins shaking up the soda water.  
     He rips the tape off his mouth.

                    FRANCISCO
          My father is rich.  He'll pay you.

                    TORTURER
          Not the correct answer, my friend.

     The torturer puts another strip of duct tape across 
     Francisco's mouth.

                    TORTURER
          We know that you went after the 
          neighbor of General Salazar, a simple 
          alfalfa farmer.  His grand-daughter 
          was shot.  This is stupid behavior, 
          Francisco.

     Francisco starts to squirm and whimper.  The torturer closes 
     one of Francisco's nostrils and sprays the pepper-laced water 
     into the other nostril.

     It's like a bomb went off in Francisco's brain.  He SCREAMS 
     and passes out.  Blood and mucous oozes out of his nose.

     INT. BARRACKS - MEXICAN MILITARY BASE - DAY

     Javier stands guard outside a door, listening  to the 
     strangulated SCREAMS of Francisco.  He's sickened.

     Manolo ignores Francisco's CRIES, while shooting the shit 
     with several of Salazar's MEN, who laugh appreciatively at 
     something he's said.

     Caroline Wakefield lies on a bench in a grey-walled holding 
     cell.  She wears paper slippers and her belt has been removed.  
     Even youth can't disguise her hangover.

     INT. SOCIAL WORKER OFFICE - MORNING

     Caroline is perched on the edge of her chair.  Across the 
     desk from her is a tired SOCIAL WORKER, 40's, who has been 
     assigned Caroline's case and is giving her the "exit" 
     interview.

                    SOCIAL WORKER
          ...How old are you?

                    CAROLINE

          Parents still together?

          Yes.

     The social worker pushes the forms she's filling out away 
     and looks again at Caroline --

          You wanna tell me what you're doing

     INT. JUVENILE DETENTION - MORNING

     A cold institutional lobby with hard plastic chairs and bad 
     lighting.  Government workers move behind thick glass windows

     Barbara Wakefield sits on one of the uncomfortable chairs.  
     She's alone and has been crying.  There's the sound of heavily 
     locked doors OPENING and Caroline appears.

     Barbara stands and wraps Caroline in her arms.

                    BARBARA
          Oh, honey.  Are you all right?

     Caroline begins to cry into her mother's chest.

     Helena slips into David's room and quietly watches him sleep.

     INT. STUDY - LATER

     Still wearing her evening gown, Helena collapses into a chair, 
     exhausted.  A TAP at the door startles her.

     It's Arnie Metzger, who goes to the bar and pours himself a 
     strong one.  They sit opposite each other and neither speaks 
     for a while.

                    HELENA
               (quietly)
          I am on the board of my son's school.  
          I had a fundraiser for A.L.V. in my 
          front yard.  I have a right to know 
          if my husband is a legitimate 
          businessman.

                    ARNIE
          Of course he is.  I've known him for 
          twenty years and he doesn't jaywalk...

     Helena is relieved, but she's not looking at Arnie and when 
     she does she sees him shaking his head in a very definitive, 
     "No."

     Arnie stands and continues talking as he walks to the windows 
     and shuts the blinds one by one.

                    ARNIE
          ...Carl is a very important member 
          of this community and when we're 
          through suing the police and the 
          district attorney and the DEA, they'll 
          have to rename the public parks for 
          your husband.

     The blinds are closed.  Arnie crosses to Helena and talks 
     very softly in her ear.  She's a beautiful woman and Arnie 
     manages to make this act seem both practical and 
     inappropriate.

                    ARNIE
               (whispering)
          Your husband is very good at his 
          job...

     Helena leans back and looks at Arnie.  He whispers more --

          into this country.

          They're whispering.  I can't hear 
          them, but I know it.  I smell 
          conspiracy.  I feel the lie vibrating 
          out of the home.

          She ain't in on it.

          dreams about busting the top people, 
          the rich people, the white people.

          shit.

          "sales force" has scattered...  How 
          am I supposed to survive?  I'm giving 
          birth in three months.  How do I get 
          through this?

                    ARNIE
          You're gonna get through it, but the 
          first thing we do is get Michael 
          Adler to represent Carl.  We get 
          Adler and we beat this thing.

          Caroline?  How well did you know 
          this boy who overdosed?

     She looks up beseechingly.

                    CAROLINE
          He didn't hang around us.  He's like 
          one of those hippie kids.  I'm not 
          part of that group.  It was a party 
          in all these rooms.  His girlfriend 
          who I barely know was completely 
          hysterical... He's blue, he's 
          puking... We didn't want to get in 
          trouble, but what were we supposed 
          to do?
               (beat)
          I mean, what would you have done if 
          you had been us?

                    BARBARA
          How well do you know this boy, Seth, 
          who was driving?  You know the police 
          have charged him with a DUI and 
          possession of marijuana.

                    CAROLINE
          He's a friend.  He's also like the 
          only one who was dealing with the 
          situation.  He'd definitely had a 
          few beers, but it's not like he wanted 
          to drive.  We didn't know what else 
          to do.
               (beat)
          It wasn't my pot.

     She searches her parents' faces.  It has been a convincing 
     performance and she expects victory.

                    ROBERT
          Okay, honey.  We understand.  You're 
          mother and I have to talk.

     Caroline is confused by this reaction.

                    BARBARA
          Honey, we'd like to talk alone.

     Caroline stands abruptly --

                    CAROLINE
          Like always.

     Caroline leaves the study and shuts the door harder than 
     necessary.

     and breathing deeply --

          I think she's lying.

          Me, too.

                    ROBERT
               (reaching a decision)
          We'll ground her, clip her wings a 
          bit.  School and scheduled activities 
          and that's it until further notice.  
          This has to be handled delicately.  
          Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's 
          office, will probably help us out, 
          quietly.  Christ, this could be 
          embarrassing.

                    BARBARA
          Honey, this is difficult, but we've 
          all had our moments.  I tried --

                    ROBERT
          Stop.  You experimented in college.
          I don't want to hear about that.

                    BARBARA
          Should we take the quotes off 
          experiment and call it what it is?

          This is different.

                    BARBARA
          Why?

                    ROBERT
          To begin with, she's only sixteen 
          years-old.

                    BARBARA
          I think she has to find out for 
          herself, on her own.  We have to
          allow her space --

                    ROBERT
          Space for what?  To O.D. like that 
          other kid?  I will not send the 
          message that this type of behavior 
          is okay with her parents.  Because 
          it isn't.  Correct?

                    BARBARA
          We don't want to push her away.
          These are growing experiences.

     Robert looks at his wife, then it dawns on him.

                    ROBERT
          How long have you known about this?

     No response.

                    ROBERT
               (yelling)
          How long have you known?

                    BARBARA
          Six months.  I found some marijuana, 
          that's all.  And a little pipe about 
          two inches long.  I talked with her.  
          She said her friends smoked pot and 
          drank --

                    ROBERT
          Explain to me how you could think 
          that I shouldn't know about this.
          Explain to me how this wouldn't be 
          relevant to me.  As a parent.

                    BARBARA
          She asked me not to.

     He leaves the room.

     INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

     Robert is in the hallway, at Caroline's door.  He opens it 
     and we get BLASTED WITH MUSIC.

     Caroline is sitting in a rocking chair with headphones on.  
     She faces the window and moves back and forth, back and forth.

     Robert calls her name, but the SOUNDTRACK is drowning him 
     out.

     He calls again, this time apparently loud enough for her to 
     hear.  She takes the headphones off - the MUSIC stops - and 
     turns to look at him.  Or rather, she looks right through 
     him, as though he didn't exist.  Robert is so taken aback by 
     the coldness of her gaze that he doesn't speak.

     She turns away from him and puts the headphones back on.

     EXT. MILITARY BASE - MEXICO - DAY

     Javier and Salazar walk across the base.  Salazar is feeling 
     ebullient and it shows.

                    SALAZAR
          You watch and learn.  I earn his 
          trust.  Then more pain.  Then I appear 
          with kindness.  Within a week he 
          will follow me around like a dog.

                    JAVIER
          But will he be house-trained?

                    SALAZAR
          When he loves me like a father, he 
          will never tell anyone he was here.
          He will freely give the names of his 
          superiors.  Then we get them and 
          they too will give us names.  And 
          eventually somebody will get us to 
          Juan Obregon and the cartel will 
          fall.

     They enter the barracks.

     INT. CELL - MEXICAN MILITARY BASE - DAY

     It's pitch black in the cell.  There's a human in here, but 
     we can't see him.

     Suddenly the door is thrown open and light floods in, 
     illuminating a very broken Francisco Flores.

     The figure of Commander Salazar fills the doorway.

                    SALAZAR
          This is shameful.  A disgrace.
          Francisco Flores --

     Francisco cowers in the corners --

                    SALAZAR
          It's all right, son.  It's all right.  
          Salazar is here.  You're among 
          gentlemen, now.  This shameful 
          treatment will stop immediately.
               (calling out)
          Guard!

     A GUARD appears in the doorway.  Francisco is spooked.

                    SALAZAR
          I want to know who is responsible 
          for this treatment.

                    GUARD
          Yes, sir!

                    SALAZAR
          We aren't barbarians.

                    GUARD
          Yes, sir!

                    SALAZAR
          Bring this man a change of good 
          clothes.  Has he eaten?

                    GUARD
          I don't know, sir.

                    SALAZAR
               (to Francisco)
          You will dine with me from now on.

     Francisco moves closer to Salazar already feeling safe in 
     his presence.

     INT. COURTHOUSE, SAN DIEGO - DAY

     A packed courthouse.  Carl is at the defense table.  He 
     doesn't look at Helena who sits in the gallery next to Arnie 
     Metzger.

     The PROSECUTOR is finishing his argument --

                    PROSECUTOR
          This is a man who heads a large 
          criminal organization with 
          international contacts we can only 
          begin to understand.  Our case against 
          him is very strong.  He is not a 
          flight risk.  His flight is assured.  
          The people ask that your honor denies 
          bail.

     The prosecutor sits.  Carl's defense lawyer, MICHAEL ADLER, 
     from the Georgetown party, stands and speaks.

                    ADLER
          My client is no more a flight risk 
          than your Honor or the able 
          prosecutor.  He is a pillar of his 
          community, a family man with a wife 
          and child in La Jolla, the community 
          where he has made his home for over 
          twenty years.  As our defense will 
          quickly show, my client is guilty of 
          nothing more than being a handy target 
          for an admitted criminal.  Therefore 
          we ask that you release Carl Ayala 
          on his own recognizance.

     Adler sits.  The JUDGE makes a quick decision.

                    JUDGE
          I'm gonna deny bail.

     The judge SLAMS his gavel.  The crowd is on its feet.  Carl 
     tries to get a glimpse of Helena.  They make eye contact.  
     Reporters from the press gallery are yelling for Helena.

     Arnie ushers her away.

     EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

     Adler, Arnie, and Helena push through a crowd toward her 
     car.

     There are several reporters there who ask questions --

                    REPORTER
          Mrs. Ayala, were you aware your 
          husband is the largest cocaine 
          smuggler in America?

                    ADLER
          Alleged, people, alleged.

     Helena gets into her car and slams the door.  Adler faces 
     the reporters.

                    REPORTER #2
          Mrs. Ayala is it true your husband 
          has ordered a hit on Eduardo Ruiz?

     Adler is in a role he relishes.  Helena drives away.  We 
     move up to Gordon, who is watching from the hotel window 
     across the street.  He speaks into a walkie-talkie, and a 
     car down below pulls out to follow Helena.

                    ADLER
          Carl Ayala sits on the board of the 
          Children's Hospital.  He is heavily 
          involved with Adult Literacy.  He 
          has a small boy and another child on 
          the way.  If you spread this kind of 
          innuendo, you can expect legal 
          recourse.  Are we clear on this point?

     Robert Wakefield talks with an Assistant District Attorney, 
     DAN KELLY, 40's.

          I appreciate you coming in so early.

                    A.D.A. KELLY
          Judge Wakefield, it's an honor to 
          handle it for you.  Consider it gone 
          away.  She's a minor; it probably 
          would've expunged on her 18th birthday 
          anyway.

                    ROBERT
          Still, this was a sensitive issue 
          for me and I wanted to thank you 
          personally.

                    A.D.A. KELLY
          Like I said, open container, P.I., 
          Misdemeanor possession.  Easy to 
          make it disappear.  For you, poof, 
          it's gone.

     A.D.A. Kelly thinks a moment, then tries for tact.

                    A.D.A. KELLY
          One thing bothers me...  That kid 
          they dropped off had coke and heroin 
          in him.  Serious amounts.  He's lucky 
          he lived.  So I gotta ask: what's 
          your daughter on?

                    ROBERT
          I don't know what you mean.

                    A.D.A. KELLY
          I mean, did you ask her?  What kind 
          of drugs has she tried?

     Robert is silent for a beat.

                    ROBERT
          I... I don't really know.

                    A.D.A. KELLY
          Is she in any kind of therapy...  
          professional help?

                    ROBERT
          No, of course not.  She's one of the

     INT. CAROLINE WAKEFIELD'S BATHROOM - MORNING

     Caroline sits on the toilet in her private bathroom.  She's 
     not going to the bathroom, it's a seat and she's wearing her 
     pajamas.  She's reading a magazine.  The exhaust fan is on.

     There are pictures of her and her friends on the walls: goofy 
     pictures from camp, from school, a collage she's made with 
     cutouts from magazine pictures and copy.

     On the sink next to her is a little square of well-charred 
     aluminum foil; she's done many hits.  She leans over and 
     picks up a small piece of crack cocaine from a small pile in 
     her soap dish.  She drops it on a clean place on the foil.  
     She picks up a lighter and the tube of a ball point pen she's 
     turned into a straw.

     She heats the bottom of the foil.  The crack "crackles."

     She chases the smoke across the foil.  A huge hit.  She leans 
     her head back, her eyes roll back, she tries to focus on the 
     magazine, on anything, she stares up at the ceiling.

     She holds it as long as she can then blows it toward the 
     exhaust fan.

     Caroline looks at her watch.  It's 7:20.  She stands suddenly, 
     unsteadily.  She looks at herself in the mirror.

     She's really high and indecisive.  She looks around wildly.

     She sees the shower.  She turns it on.  She drops her pajamas.

     She goes back to the foil and hits another piece of the rock, 
     taking another really big hit.  She crushes the foil and 
     flushes it down the toilet.  She hops in the shower.

     IN THE SHOWER

     The water streams over her face.  After a long beat she 
     finally exhales the smoke of the hit through the water and 
     steam.  She's in ecstacy.

     It's almost time to leave for school.

          older strange man, TIGRILLO, Latino, 
          40's, fit and tough looking.

     The man is very good.  He juggles the ball and bounces it 
     off his head and David follows him away from the center of 
     the playground.

     EXT. PLAYGROUND - CONTINUOUS

     Helena notices David moving away while playing with the man.

          David, come back here this minute.
          David!

     As she closes distance the man stops juggling the ball and 
     abruptly picks up David and begins swinging him around by 
     his arms.  David is having fun as Helena approaches.

          Thank you.  That's a valuable lesson.  
          David, come on.

     The strange man holds David tighter so that he's no longer 
     having fun.  He begins to wriggle --

          Mrs. Ayala --

     This gets her attention --

                    STRANGE MAN
          Your husband owes a lot of money.  
          Enough that snapping this kid's neck 
          wouldn't nearly cover it.

     David begins to cry.  Helena looks around wildly for help.

                    STRANGE MAN
          You better come up with it in a hurry 
          or your kid is going to disappear, 
          and he won't turn up until the evening 
          news.

     He drops David who runs to his mother.

          In my home I have B&W speakers.  I 
          recently purchased a compact disc 
          burner.  I can make my own cd's, 
          with whatever music I like, as if I 
          bought them at the store, only I 
          don't have to pay these crazy prices.

                    SALAZAR
          We have much in common.  We both 
          attended school in the United States, 
          and both of our fathers are engineers.

                    FRANCISCO
          I got into stereo equipment when I 
          was a kid.  Some people don't notice

          Of course it is.  Have some more 
          wine.

     INT. SAN DIEGO JAIL - DAY

     Castro and Gordon sit with Eduardo Ruiz in a conference room.

     They are recording his statements.

                    RUIZ
          Carlos, I mean Carl, started out in 
          the family connection business: real 
          estate in Tijuana, fishing boats out 
          of Ensenada, hydroponic raspberries.  
          He met up with the Obregon brothers 
          of the Tijuana Cartel who were 
          interested in two things: entering 
          society and using his fishing boats.

                    GORDON
          So you pay off our customs officials?

                    RUIZ
          In Mexico law enforcement is an 
          entrepreneurial activity, this is 
          not so true for the USA.
               (condescending)
          Using regression analysis we made a 
          study of the customs lanes at the 
          border and calculated the odds of a 
          search.  The odds are not high, and 
          we found variables that reduce the 
          odds.  We hire drivers with nothing 
          to lose.  Then we throw a lot of 
          product at the problem.  Some get 
          stopped.  Enough get through.  It's 
          not difficult.

                    CASTRO
          You'd think he wasn't sitting here 
          facing life in prison.

                    RUIZ
          This has worked for years and it 
          will continue to work for years.
          NAFTA makes everything more difficult 
          for you.  The border is disappearing.
               (pointing at them)
          You people are like those Japanese 
          soldiers left behind on deserted 
          islands who think that World War II 
          is still going on.
               (with total disdain)
          Let me be the first to  tell you, 
          your government surrendered this war 
          a long time ago.

                    GORDON
               (to Castro)
          This attitude's not gonna help him 
          any, is it?

                    RUIZ
          I got greedy.  I decided to bring a 
          little in on my own and somebody 
          tipped you off.  That was my mistake.  
          Carl would never be so stupid.

                    GORDON
          He hired you.  That was a mistake.

                    RUIZ
          Carl and I were friends from 
          childhood.  He was loyal, that's not 
          a mistake.

     EXT. TIJUANA - SAN DIEGO BORDER CROSSING - DAY

     Car after car, an unending multi-lane stream of vehicles 
     moving into the U.S.  Any of these cars could be carrying 
     drugs.

     INT. CUSTOMS CONTROL BOOTH - DAY

     On an elevated walkway, this booth commands a view of 
     everything.  Robert and Sheridan listen to an OFFICIAL give 
     the spiel.

                    OFFICIAL
          The busiest land border crossing in 
          the world.  Over forty-one thousand 
          vehicles per day, twenty-two thousand 
          pedestrians on foot.  I think we do 
          a pretty good job but we know a lot 
          of drugs are still getting through.

                    ROBERT
          Any idea how much?

                    OFFICIAL
          I've read official estimates but I 
          wouldn't bet my house on them.  I've 
          heard the entire cocaine supply for 
          the United States can fit into four 
          tractor-trailers.
               (gestures to the 
               traffic)
          At least a half-dozen of those cars 
          right out there are carrying a load 
          of dope, with drivers employed by 
          people who don't give a damn if 
          they're caught or not.

                    ROBERT
          What do you look for?

                    OFFICIAL
          We ask questions and measure the 
          answers.  When something doesn't 
          ring true, a fact that doesn't make 
          sense, a slight hesitation, then 
          it's off to secondary for a closer 
          look.  Before NAFTA we had about 1.9 
          million trucks a year.  Now it's 
          almost double.  Pretty soon there'll 
          be Mexican truck companies that will 
          have as much freedom in crossing the 
          border as American truck companies.

                    ROBERT
          Any way we can do it better?

                    OFFICIAL
          Sure.  More money in intelligence on 
          their side of the border.  So we 
          have a better idea who we're looking 
          for.  More dogs.  More people.  
          Supposed to be getting some giant x-
          ray machines to run the trucks 
          through.  Outside of martial law 
          that's about the best you're gonna 
          do.
               (beat)
          But, I should tell you, there are 
          two things that really have us on 
          edge right now.
               (beat)
          In the last six months seizures have 
          tripled, even though we're pulling 
          over the same number of cars.  What 
          does that tell you?

                    ROBERT
          That triple the amount of stuff is 
          going through.

                    OFFICIAL
          Right.  But, that's not the biggest 
          problem.  One of our Intel officers 
          picked up information from DEA that 
          traffickers have come up with a 
          process, a chemical process, to turn 
          coke into something else.  It doesn't 
          smell like coke.  It doesn't look 
          like coke.  And what's worse, it 
          doesn't react to field test.  It 
          could be anything.  Maybe it's already 
          happening.  I mean, how would we 
          know?

     Robert looks out at the border activity.  It's anarchy.

     Helena is on the floor surrounded by papers.  She's made 
     piles of certain things: articles of incorporation,

     prep-school gangsters following a familiar route.

                    SETH
          You know my dad takes eight red cold 
          pills every day?  He and my mom have 
          cocktail hour every night, from six

          Then here's a little bump.

     They turn down a street with a lot of activity on it.

                    SETH
          Drugs weren't even a problem until a 
          hundred years ago when the white men 
          in power declared them a problem.  
          Opiates.  But, who was using 'em?  
          Chinese immigrants.  Slave labor.  
          And the darkies up in the inner cities 
          dancing to them evil rhythms of ju-
          ju music.  People on the fringe.  
          Artists.  Decadent rich people.  And 
          who got scared?  White men in power.  
          Who's scared today?  White men in 
          power.  If J.P. Morgan and John D.

          it'd be a whole different story.

     TWO YOUNG STREET DEALERS fall in step with them.  One talks

          911, and the come down.

     One dealer hurries ahead toward the doorway of a falling- 
     down building.

                    STREET DEALER
          How much?

                    SETH
          Two hundred of C, hundred of the 
          other.

     The dealer looks them over.  He looks behind them down the 
     street.

                    CAROLINE
          Come on... We've been here before.

                    STREET DEALER
          Then, let's see your money.

     Seth and Caroline are suspicious.  They carefully show money 
     they both have in their front right pockets.  The dealer 
     feints like he might grab it.

                    STREET DEALER
          Up the steps.  You the experts.  You 
          know what to do.

     They hurry up the steps into the dingy brownstone.

     INT. ROW HOUSE - DAY

     They step into the narrow foyer between the outer door and 
     the inner door.  There are three other PEOPLE waiting 
     nervously.  An older JUNKIE shoots them a crazy look --

          What are you two, about twelve?

                    CAROLINE
          Fuck off.

     They wait.  Finally, the first dealer appears in the inner 
     door and lets them through.

     INT. FIRST FLOOR CORRIDOR - DAY

     They wait in a line in the narrow, poorly lit corridor.  At 
     the end of the hall a hatch in a door slides back and the 
     drugstore is open.  People buy and leave.

     Seth and Caroline approach.  In the hatch is a hardened 
     dealer, 20's, named SKETCH, which is tattooed on his forearm.  
     He checks out Caroline's body.

                    SETH
          Caroline, give me your money.

     She hands over her money to Seth who pays and gets the drugs: 
     gram baggies of rock stamped with a scorpion and "911," and 
     wax-paper bindles of heroin, also labeled, "911."

     Caroline has been watching the transaction.  Sketch makes 
     slow eye contact with Caroline.  After a beat --

                    SKETCH
          Goodbye... Caroline.

     Seth and Caroline make their way out of the building.

                    SETH
               (under his breath)
          Yeah, right.

     EXT. BUILDING - DAY

     Seth and Caroline hold hands as they hurry down the steps.  
     The lookout speaks without moving his lips.

                    STREET DEALER
          Now, get the fuck out of here.

     Caroline stops suddenly.  She pulls Seth to her and kisses 
     him hard.  There's no better moment than the one right after 
     scoring before you start using.

     EXT. VILLA ELAINE - DAY

     prostitute taking care of business, everyone fresh out of

     They approach the front desk which is behind six inches of 
     glass.

                    SETH
          We'd like room 205.

                    DESKMAN
          Then you hand me twenty-eight dollars.

     INT. ROOM 205 - VILLA ELAINE - DAY

     They enter and the light bulb goes out.  Seth fumbles his 
     way to the mini-fridge, which he opens, throwing feeble light 
     across the floor.

     They check out the decrepit room: the sloping mattress, the 
     black and white television bolted to the bureau.  The mini-

     Seth prepares the drugs by the light of the mini-fridge.

          I love this place.

     Seth dumps the drugs on the bedside table.  From other pockets 
     he extracts aluminum foil, lighter, tube.  She trails away 
     watching him fix the first hit.

                    SETH
          Did Courtney Love play Nancy in Syd 
          and Nancy?

                    CAROLINE
          I think so.  If she didn't she should 
          have.
               (checks her watch)
          I've only got maybe an hour.  Then 
          volleyball practice is over and I 
          have to be home.

                    SETH
          Why?  Nobody's there.

     He prepares the first hit.  She does it and lies back.  He 
     does one.

                    CAROLINE
               (blowing out the hit)
          The maid... They ask her what time I 
          get back.  She spies for them.

     Seth starts kissing her.  They try to get into it, but both 
     of them are thinking about the drugs.

                    CAROLINE
          I wish we could stay here.  Just be 
          here forever and ever.  Make it a 
          little home.

     She leans over to snort a tiny line of heroin.

                    SETH
          I want to have sex and do a hit right 
          as we're coming.

     Caroline's distracted by the line she's snorting.  After a 
     while...

                    CAROLINE
          Okay.

     Seth begins undoing her jeans.

     INT. EPIC BUNKER LOBBY - DAY

     SUPERTITLE: EL PASO, TEXAS

     Robert and Sheridan listen to the official tour of the EPIC 
     center delivered by the SPECIAL-AGENT-IN-CHARGE, 40, a sincere 
     weight-lifter with a sincere crew-cut.

                    SPECIAL-AGENT-IN-CHARGE
          ...Over 200 DEA field agents, a budget 
          of almost 100 million dollars and 
          state of the art communications 
          equipment make the El Paso Information 
          Center the Drug Enforcement 
          Administration's flagship for the 
          21st century.

     INT. EPIC BUNKER CAFETERIA - DAY

     A huge lunchroom.  Long plastic institutional tables and 
     agents minding their own business,

     Robert, Sheridan, and their Epic Guide walk through.  They 
     pass a wall of black and white head shots --

                    ROBERT
          Who are these guys?

                    SPECIAL-AGENT-IN-CHARGE
          Agents who died in the field.

     EXT. BINOCULAR POV - DAY

     of large mansion with manicured grounds.  The back lawn is 
     filled with children, balloons, a merry-go-round, and pony 
     rides.  It's a sumptuous children's birthday party.

                    SPECIAL-AGENT-IN-CHARGE
          That house, that you see from the 
          DEA headquarters, belonged to Porfirio 
          Madrigal -- the Lord of the Skies, 
          largest trafficker in Mexico.

     ANGLE ON ROBERT

     looking through the binoculars.

                    ROBERT
          He died in a liposuction surgery, 
          right?

                    SPECIAL-AGENT-IN-CHARGE
          Right.  Now it's used by somebody 
          from the Juarez Cartel, one of his 
          lieutenants...  Who knows?
               (beat)
          Every damn day there's birthday party.  
          At first I thought they must have 
          three hundred children, then I 
          realized they're taunting us.  Three 
          miles away and we can't touch them.  
          Ha, ha, ha.

     BINOCULAR POV: a child running in circles holding a clutch 
     of colored balloons.

                    ROBERT
          Who do we interface with on their 
          side?

                    SPECIAL-AGENT-IN-CHARGE
          What do you mean?

                    ROBERT
          I mean, who runs interdiction on the 
          Mexico side?

                    SPECIAL-AGENT-IN-CHARGE
          I don't know.  I don't think there's 
          any one person.
               (thinks)
          See the problem is the Juarez cartel 
          owns everything and everybody, all 
          the property on the Mexican side, 
          sometimes all the property on both 
          sides.  Warehouses, transportation, 
          even tunnels.  It's very organized.

     EXT. TRAMAC - DAY

     Robert, walking with purpose, leads his group to their plane.

     INT. MILITARY JET - DAY

     Robert and Sheridan and several DEA, Law Enforcement, and 
     Military Officials.  It's a nice plane, used for important 
     people and Robert has the best seat.

                    ROBERT
          I want everyone thinking out the box 
          for a second.  What are we gonna do 
          about Mexico?
               (silence)
          Come on, guys.  Out of the box.

     The men on the plane just stare at him.  Finally the REP 
     FROM DEA leans forward.

                    REP FROM DEA
          Unlimited funds?

                    ROBERT
          Unlimited.

                    REP FROM DEA
          From a DEA standpoint we need a vetted 
          task force and matching funds.  And 
          cut the red tape on getting them 
          equipment and training.

     Robert turns to the others.

                    ROBERT
          Come on.  I want to hear from 
          everyone: FBI.  Customs.  Treatment.
          Is there anyone from treatment on 
          this plane?
               (no one answers)
          Then I want an answer for why there 
          isn't anyone from treatment.
               (beat)
          Look, we know we have to bust one of 
          these cartels, Juarez or Tijuana, 
          not just as a symbol, but hell yes, 
          also as a symbol - they are symbols - 
          and there's nothing wrong with sending 
          a message.  That's why when Carlos 
          Ayala hired Michael Adler lead 
          defense, I flew Ben Williams to San 
          Diego to prosecute.  Because he's 
          the best we have, he's our symbol 
          that we're serious about putting the 
          top people away.
               (beat)
          So, as of right now, this flight 
          only, consider the dam on new ideas 
          thrown open.

     Still, no one else says anything.  They watch Robert 
     impassively.

                    ROBERT
          If I'm not mistaken, we got DEA, 
          Pentagon, U.S. Attorneys office, 
          about a billion dollars of budget 
          right here.  So what are you people 
          waiting for?

     Establishing shot of a tall glass building in the downtown

     INT. ARNIE METZGER'S OFFICE - DAY

     Helena and Arnie enter his office.  The furniture is sleek 
     mid-century modern, and the view of the harbor is 
     extraordinary.

                    ARNIE
          On a clear day you can see Mexico 
          City.

     Arnie stands very close to Helena and looks at her profile.

                    ARNIE
          This place is swept twice a day.  I 
          learned that in Miami in '85.  Then 
          the U.S. shut down the whole 
          Caribbean, but it's a big game of 
          wack-a-mole.  Knock it down in Miami, 
          it pops up here.  And San Diego is 
          so much more relaxing.

                    HELENA
          Arnie, I need money.  Somebody 
          threatened my children.  They want a 
          first payment of three million 
          dollars.

                    ARNIE
          Helena, if I had it I would give it 
          to you, but I don't have that kind 
          of money.

                    HELENA
          Arnie, help me.  Doesn't anyone owe 
          us money?

                    ARNIE
          Yes, I told you before, there are 
          people who owe you money but they're 
          not paying.  There's too much heat 
          on Carl.

                    HELENA
          Please.  Tell me who Carl sells to.

     Arnie thinks.

                    ARNIE
          Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you.
          You do not want to come into contact 
          with these people.  Only Carl knows 
          who they are.  That's his real asset.  
          Ruiz doesn't know them.  They don't 
          know Ruiz.  Church and State.

                    HELENA
          What about legitimate businesses?
          We own a construction concern, real
          estate --

                    ARNIE
          Laundromats for the washing of money.  
          Unfortunately, Carl had only one 
          successful business.

                    HELENA
          Don't you have some good news?  Isn't 
          there something positive you could 
          say.

     There isn't.  Helena looks Arnie in the eyes.

                    HELENA
               (vulnerable)
          Sometimes I wonder what I'll do if 
          Carl doesn't get out.  I'm not very 
          adept at being on my own.  I've always 
          had a man in my life.  Always.

                    ARNIE
          I remember when I first met you: 
          little Helen Watts from the wrong 
          side of somewhere.  I had a feeling 
          even then that your survival instincts 
          were pretty well honed.

                    HELENA
          I'm glad you think so, but I'm 
          picturing a debt-ridden, thirty-two 
          year-old mother whose ex-husband is 
          being compared to Pablo Escobar.
               (beat)
          And I'm wondering who would want to 
          be with someone like that?

     It takes a great effort for Arnie not to answer.

     INT. ARMORED SUV - MEXICO - DAY

     Javier and Manolo ride through a nice neighborhood in Mexico 
     City.  Javi isn't familiar with the roads and drives 
     cautiously.

     A young lady, ROSARIO, early 20's, sexy and vulnerable, rides 
     in the back of the SUV.

                    ROSARIO
          You two don't like me, do you?

     Manolo laughs and looks her up and down.  Javi watches her 
     in the rearview mirror.

                    JAVIER
          We don't have an opinion on you.

                    ROSARIO
               (to Javi)
          Maybe it's because I'm getting an 
          apartment nicer than anything you'll 
          ever see in your life?

     Javi says nothing.

                    ROSARIO
               (re: the neighborhood)
          I can't believe the old man kept his 
          promise.

                    JAVIER
          The General is a man of his word.

                    ROSARIO
          They will say anything to get what 
          they want, but then you remind them, 
          it's always tomorrow, tomorrow, 
          tomorrow.
               (beat)
          Occupational hazard, I guess.

     Javi just looks at her in the rearview mirror.

                    ROSARIO
          His friend is giving us the apartment 
          so it's not like he paid.  It's more 
          like a favor.

     Javier pulls the SUV to the curb in front of a beautiful 
     colonial-style apartment complex in the verdant neighborhood.

     EXT. VERDANT NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

     Birds are chirping.  Javi waits in the car as Manolo takes 
     the young lady's bags from the vehicle and carries them up 
     the walkway to the arched doorway.  He knocks on the heavy 
     wooden door.

                    ROSARIO
          You don't have the keys.  Oh that's 
          perfect.  Are you an idiot?

     Manolo knocks again.  They wait a long beat.

                    MANOLO
          There's supposed to be someone here 
          to let you in.

     Finally, the door swings open and a BODYGUARD is standing 
     there.  Rosario SQUEALS and sweeps past him into the vast 
     space.  The bodyguard motions for Manolo to put the bags 
     inside the door.

     Manolo sets the bags down and sees another MAN standing a 
     few feet away.  The man wears sunglasses.  His complexion is 
     strange and his neck is bandaged.

     The body guard escorts Manolo back outside where he hears 
     Rosario's happy LAUGHTER drifting down from an upstairs 
     window.

     INT. SUV - DAY

     Manolo gets into the truck.  He's shaken by what he's just 
     seen.

                    MANOLO
          Madrigal's alive.

                    JAVIER
          What?

                    MANOLO
          Porfirio Madrigal is not dead.  I 
          just saw him.

     A long beat as Javier considers this.

                    JAVIER
          This is why Salazar is so interested 
          in cleaning up Tijuana.  Madrigal, 
          who's supposed to be dead, owns him.
          And Madrigal is making a move on 
          Juan Obregon.

     Javier calmly drives away.

                    MANOLO
          Javi!  Come on.  Don't pull this you 
          don't care bullshit.  This is 
          incredible information.  It must be.

     Barbara drives Robert home from the airport.  There's a sense 
     they've been silent for a while.

                    ROBERT
          I think we may have found our Mexican 
          Drug Czar.  It's this General, 
          Salazar.  At least I'll have somebody 
          on the other side I can talk to.

                    BARBARA
          Does this mean you're going to be 
          gone more?

     A long silence.

                    ROBERT
          Possibly.

     Another silence.

                    BARBARA

          present a unified front.

          If you start in on the war metaphors 
          I'm going to drive this car into a

          Look, I'm as worried as you are --

                    BARBARA
          No, I don't think so.  Leave me alone, 
          give me money.  That's what I get 
          from our daughter.  She has a way of 
          shutting me out that seems very 
          familiar.

                    ROBERT
          Yeah, well, she has a way of self- 
          medicating that probably seems 
          familiar, too.

     She looks at him, stung.

                    BARBARA
          I'm not the one who has to have three 
          scotches just to walk in the door 
          and say hello.

                    ROBERT
          I have a drink before dinner to take 
          the edge off my day.  That's 
          different.

                    BARBARA
          Oh, it is?

                    ROBERT
          Yeah, because the alternative is to 
          be bored to death.

     EXT. WAKEFIELD HOUSE - NIGHT

     He car pulls into the driveway.  Robert gets out.  Barbara

     Robert stands outside her closed bathroom door.

     There is nothing, then from the other side of the door, the 
     faint sound of a lighter CLICKING.  AGAIN and AGAIN, then a 
     COUGH.

     INT. CAROLINE WAKEFIELD'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Caroline sits on the toilet.  Glamour Magazine on her lap.

     She's wild-eyed and paranoid.  The exhaust fan is running.

     The aluminum foil is on the sink.  The last little bit of 
     heroin in a wax-paper bundle sits beside it.

     She's listening hard for any SOUND in the house.  What she's 
     wondering is if someone is outside the door listening.

     She puts a piece of crack on the foil and listens hard once 
     more before lighting it.  She does the hit.

     And seems to feel better.

     Suddenly there's a POUNDING on the door.  The VOICE of her 
     father muffled through the solid wood.

                    ROBERT (V.O.)
               (muffled by the door)
          Caroline.  Open this door immediately.

     Caroline is up like a shot.  She looks around.  The POUNDING 
     on the door gets stronger.

     She crumples the foil and drops it in the toilet.

     The bathroom door SOUNDS like it's about to cave inward.

                    CAROLINE
               (faking the best she 
               can)
          Who is it?  I'm going to the bathroom.

     She's coping now, full parallel process mode: she dumps the 
     last heroin on the back of her hand and snorts it, checking 
     her nose in the mirror as she reaches for a can of air 
     freshener which she sprays into the air.

                    CAROLINE
          One minute.

     She takes the remaining crack, lighters, tubes, little smudgy 
     druggy bits of paraphernalia and carefully places it all in 
     a hiding place above the bathroom cabinet.

     She pauses a beat, then opens the door, and tries to brush 
     by her father while avoiding his eyes.

                    CAROLINE
          Excuse me --

     Robert grabs her by the arms.  He pushes her against the 
     wall and looks at her pupils.  He looks at her fingernails.  
     The blister on her thumb from working the lighter is red and 
     irritated.

                    ROBERT
          You're not going anywhere, young 
          lady.

     She stands there; she's very high.

     Robert sniffs the air.  He throws open cabinets, searching 
     for drugs.  He sees the smudge mark on the counter left by 
     the charred aluminum foil.

                    ROBERT
          Where is it?  Where are the drugs?
               (yelling)
          Where are they?

                    CAROLINE
          Fuck you.  I wasn't doing anything.  
          You're like the Gestapo.

     Robert KICKS the cabinets.

                    ROBERT
          Fuck me?  Oh, okay.  Fuck me.  Fuck 
          you.

     Robert is losing it.  He throws stuff around the bathroom 
     and then, for the first time, looks up.  He sees the long 
     light in the box atop the medicine cabinet and it dawns on 
     him.

                    ROBERT
          I'm going to ask you one time to 
          tell me the truth so that I can help 
          you.

     She just stares.

                    ROBERT
          Okay, young lady, that's it.

                    CAROLINE
          Like I give a fuck.

     Robert reaches above the medicine cabinet and pulls out a 
     charred spoon.  It confuses him.  He throws it into the sink.

     He pulls out another spoon.  He pulls out crumpled bindles, 
     rolled up, encrusted dollar bills, exhausted lighters, a 
     pill bottle, an empty pint of vodka.

     The detritus of drug addiction keeps on coming, filling up 
     the sink.  Robert stares at it, the amount and complexity 
     has him momentarily baffled.

                    ROBERT
          What is wrong with you?  What?
               (beat)
          You're going away.  You're getting 
          help somewhere.

                    CAROLINE
          You can't make me.

                    ROBERT
          Oh, yes I can.

     Javi drives down to the third floor underground.  He pulls 
     into a parking spot next to a white sedan.  He slides open 
     the cargo door of his van.

     The cargo door of the sedan opens.  Javi quickly gets into 
     the sedan.

     INT. SEDAN - DAY

     Special Agents Hughes and Johnson welcome Javi.

                    JAVIER
          Where are we going?

     Hughes sticks out his hand.

          Somewhere safe.

          Where?

                    JOHNSON
          A place we have, that we know is 
          protected.

     splash nearby.

               (confused by this)
          We thought maybe you'd have that 
          kind of information for us.

                    JAVIER
               (feigning surprise)
          This is a very different proposition.

     Johnson and Hughes exchange a glance.

                    JOHNSON
          We pay for that kind of information.

     A fat kid in an inner-tube floats behind them.

          So it was my birthday an my ex-wife 
          was getting remarried and I was in 
          some church basement telling a bunch 
          of strangers how it was a good day 
          because I didn't have to eat out of 
          a dumpster.  That was enough to send 
          me out on big one.
               (beat)
          I've been thinking a lot about the 
          first step: that I came to believe I 
          was powerless over alcohol and that 
          my life had become unmanageable.
               (beat)
          See my disease tells me I don't have 
          a disease.  That I'm fine.  That 
          it's my birthday and I can have one 
          little drink, then one little line, 
          then one little Valium, then two 
          more fat lines, then two more 10 mil 
          Valium... Six months later I wake up 
          in a sober living house in Philly.  
          And I'm from Dallas, people.
               (beat)
          It's a disease -- an allergy of the 
          body and an obsession of the mind.

          and today I'm a grateful recovering 
          alcoholic who didn't eat out of a 
          dumpster.  Thanks.

     said.

          How much will you give me in cash?  
          Today.

     The appraiser taps out some numbers on a calculator and shows 
     the figure to Helena.

                    HELENA
          You must be joking.  That's a fraction 
          of their value.

     stereo; discreet flatscreen HD TV.

     Helena stares at a painting on one of the bookshelves.  It 
     is "Boy with a Hoop," a small portrait by Rafael Colonel.

     She goes to it and looks from different angles.  She reaches 
     out and jiggles the oil.  Nothing happens.  She looks behind 
     the painting at the backing.

     She notices that one corner is not glued down.  She picks up 
     a letter opener and pries the paper back.  An envelope slips 
     out.

     Inside the envelope: neat, thin strips of paper dense with 
     information in a miniscule type and a magnetic key card.

                    SALAZAR
          I've been too busy to completely 
          settle in.

     Salazar proffers a chair and they sit next to each other 
     like Brezhnev and Nixon.  PHOTOGRAPHERS begin SNAPPING 
     pictures.  After a few moments, Salazar waves them away, and 
     they lower their cameras and leave.

                    ROBERT
          You've been making very good progress 
          against the Tijuana cartel.

                    SALAZAR
          Yes, I am confident that Juan Obregon 
          will be taken into custody before 
          the end of the year.  But, you must 
          understand that it is very difficult 
          because of corruption in the police 
          force.  We get a tip that he is one 
          place, then we get there and he is 
          already gone, having been warned by 
          someone on our side.

                    ROBERT
          Hopefully the exchange of training 
          methods and information between our 
          countries will help with this problem.

                    SALAZAR
          Yes, I hope so as well.

                    ROBERT
          Let me ask you a related question.  
          We've talked about the supply side, 
          but what about demand?  What is your 
          policy for treating addiction?

                    SALAZAR
          Addicts treat themselves... they 
          overdose and then there's one less 
          to worry about.

     Robert cannot respond.

     EXT. SERENITY OAKS - WALKWAY - DAY

     Caroline ambles alone down a walkway at the treatment 
     facility.

     She looks through the trees that surround facility and notices 
     cars going by.

     INT. LOW-RENT HOTEL - DAY

     Gordon and another DEA AGENT escort Ruiz up the stairs of a 
     large, older hotel.

                    RUIZ
          This is ridiculous.  Why is there no 
          elevator?

                    GORDON
          When the DEA gets into the narcotics 
          business, then we'll stay at the 
          Four Seasons.

     They walk down a hotel hallway.  Two more AGENTS stand outside 
     Room 407.  Gordon opens the door and they enter.

     INT. SUITE OF CHEAP HOTEL ROOMS - DAY

     There are more AGENTS inside and old food and coffee 
     containers.  Gordon gives Ruiz a tour.  There are several 
     rooms.  A bored Castro sits at a table staring at a Scrabble 
     board.

                    CASTRO
          Eddie, how you like your new home?  
          I hope you hate it as much as I do.

     Ruiz looks around with disgust.  He's accustomed to finer 
     places.  He goes to a window and looks out.

     RUIZ'S POV: of the Federal Court building not far away.

                    RUIZ
          This is not what my lawyers 
          negotiated.

     Gordon pours himself a cup of coffee.

                    GORDON
          Fuck your lawyers.  You aren't getting 
          any cappuccino or Biscotti either.

     INT. FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - DAY

     A packed, tense courtroom listens to testimony from a 
     government witness, FRANK, 50's, very matter-of-fact and 
     truthful.

                    FRANK
          He first came to me in January.  
          That would've been nineteen eighty- 
          seven.  He wanted to rent warehouse 
          space along the harbor.  I didn't 
          ask too many questions; I'm a 
          businessman also.

     INT. FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - DAY

     Another witness, MRS. BERRY, 40's, pedantic on the stand --

                    MRS. BERRY
          I told Mr. Ayala there were 
          irregularities in his tax return.  
          And I couldn't represent him unless 
          we could explain this...

     INT. FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - DAY

     SHEILA, 38, a mousy secretary, is on the stand.  Carlos sits 
     at the defendant's table listening raptly.  Gordon and Castro 
     sit in the back watching Helena who pays close attention to 
     the witness --

                    SHEILA
          I was the company secretary from 
          1991 to 1994.  I supposedly worked 
          for all six companies.  But... they 
          weren't... I mean, it was just one 
          empty office with a desk and a 
          telephone.  We never sold anything 
          the whole time I was there.  Sometimes 
          people came and got paid.  I don't 
          really know what we did.

                    PROSECUTOR
          Did Mr. Ayala say where the money 
          came from?

                    SHEILA
          No, and I didn't ask.

                    PROSECUTOR
          Where do you think it came from?

     Carl's lawyer, Adler, is on his feet --

                    KAUFMAN
          This speculation --

                    PROSECUTOR
          I'll rephrase.  Did you feel like 
          you were engaged in a legal 
          enterprise?

     Sheila is reluctant to answer.

                    SHEILA
          No, not really.

     Helena catches Carl's eye and they share a grim moment.

     INT. CARL'S UPSTAIRS STUDY - DAY

     Helena sits at Carl's office desk.  On the desk in front of 
     her are the lists she found and an encrypted cell phone.

     Helena picks up the phone.  Her hands are shaking.  She is 
     crying as she dials.  A voice on the other end answers.

                    FRANCISCO (V.O.)
          Who is this?

     Helena gathers her courage, then...

                    HELENA
          A friend... of Carlos Ayala.

     There is a long pause.

                    FRANCISCO (V.O.)
          Yes.

                    HELENA
          I'm on a special phone, may I speak 
          freely?

                    FRANCISCO (V.O.)
          You may speak.

                    HELENA
          I have a job for you and I don't 
          have much time.

     EXT. BOTANICAL GARDEN - DAY

     Helena watches David look at the wide variety of plants and 
     flowers.  All around them a GROUP of 3rd graders, in identical 
     T-shirts, enjoy a field trip.

                    FRANCISCO (V.O.)
          I love this place.  Don't turn around.

     Behind her Francisco Flores takes a photo with an instant 
     camera.

                    FRANCISCO
          You were followed by the police, but 
          they won't hear us over the children.  
          I want to use a bomb.

                    HELENA
          You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him 
          or something?

                    FRANCISCO
          I don't really like guns.  You shoot 
          someone in the head three times and 
          some doctor will keep them alive.

                    HELENA
          When will you do it?

                    FRANCISCO
          I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the 
          only real witness against Carl.  The 
          security is very tight.  There may 
          not be a way.

                    HELENA
          There's always a way.  If people get 
          to the Pope or the President, you 
          can get to him.

     Francisco laughs.

                    FRANCISCO
          Careful... You're sounding like your 
          husband, Mrs. Ayala.

     INT. JAVI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Anna sits in the living room, staring.  She appears too upset 
     to speak.  The apartment is cleaner.  There have been other 
     changes.  There's a new rug.

                    JAVIER
          What?  What is it?

                    ANNA
          It's very hard for me to come and 
          tell you this.

     Javier just watches her.

          It's Manolo.  He's going to do 
          something stupid.  I'm worried that 
          he'll get himself killed.

     He keeps watching.

                    ANNA
          He's saying he's going to talk to 
          the Americans.  Become an informer.

     He says they pay a lot of money.

          Why does he need money?

          He has debts.  He has gambling debts.  
          He owes a lot of money.

          How much?

                    ANNA
          Nine thousand dollars.

     A long beat.

     Robert rides in glum silence.  He looks at passersby who are 
     almost all black and almost all stare back at the white man 
     in his Cadillac.

     A group of young men stare threateningly as he rolls past.

     On the street, in the lee of a Brownstone staircase, a deal

     He turns a corner and is suddenly in a drive-thru drug market.  
     Dealers, HUSTLERS, run at the windows from both sides,

          I don't know what to say.

     AT THE INTERSECTION

     behind Robert's car, Caroline crosses the street toward 
     Sketch's house.

     INT. SKETCH'S BEDROOM - DAY

     A single candle lights the room.  Caroline is underneath 
     Sketch the drug dealer.  He is pounding away.  As she clutches 
     his back and holds on, her expression is both surprised and 
     druggy, and SOUNDS escape her mouth that she wouldn't believe 
     she could make.

     There's a KNOCK on the door.  Sketch continues his business.  
     The KNOCKING is more insistent.  Finally, he stops and gets 
     up and goes to the door.  Caroline lies back.  She's in a 
     bed with black sheets in a room with nothing else in it but 
     a dresser and some duffle bags.

     Sketch opens the door --

                    SKETCH
          What the fuck do you want?

     SOMEBODY outside says something.  Sketch walks over to a 
     duffle bag and extracts some product.  Caroline's eyes are 
     glued to it as Sketch hands it through the door.  Sketch 
     sees her staring at the drugs.

     He comes back to bed.

                    SKETCH
          You want some of that?

     Caroline nods.

          that?

          Please --

          What you gonna do?

     She turns her back to him, pouting.  He laughs.

                    SKETCH
          Maybe a taste.

     He reaches over beside the bed where there is a small tray.

     On the tray is a rig, spoon, several powders, and an eye 
     dropper.  He pulls the candle over and rapidly fixes a 
     speedball.  He pulls the fluid into the neck of the syringe 
     and holds it up the light.  It has Caroline transfixed.

                    SKETCH
          Feed this to you like a little bird.

     He squirts the tiniest amount of fluid into the air.  It 
     arcs in the candlelight.

          Don't --

                    SKETCH
          You want this?

     She nods.

                    SKETCH
          This is the Express train.  Baby 
          turnin' pro and getting down in a 
          big, big hole.

     Her concentration is entirely, hypnotically focused on the 
     syringe.

     Sketch moves the syringe toward her lips.

                    SKETCH
          Kiss it.  Kiss your new mommy hello.

     Caroline moves her mouth toward the side of the syringe, her 
     lips part.

     Sketch pulls the sheet back, exposing her legs.  He grips 
     one powerful hand around her ankle and squeezes... Veins 
     stand out on her foot.

     He slides the needle into the largest vein and slowly 
     depresses the plunger.

     Caroline watches, then her head tilts back, then forward, 
     she GROANS, sexually and slumps against the pillows, her 
     eyes half-open, her lips twitching.

     Sketch puts the rig back on the tray, then admires Caroline's 
     beauty for a second before starting to fuck her again.

     Gordon and Castro and two other AGENTS escort Ruiz out of 
     the hotel and usher him into a waiting cruiser.

     the courthouse.

     EXT. COURTHOUSE PARKING LOT - DAY

     The cruiser pulls into a fenced and gated parking lot.

     Gordon, Castro and Ruiz, walking with a limp, cross to the 
     building entrance.

     As they push inside, Francisco Flores, in a conservative 
     grey suit passes them going outside.

     The parking lot is empty of people.  The guards at the gate 
     talk about something distracting.

     Francisco passes by the cruiser and drops his keys.  Kneeling 
     down he extracts a small, powerful, magnetized bomb from his 
     jacket.  He attaches it to the underside of the vehicle, 
     stands and walks toward the guard gate.

          Your honor, it has come to our 
          attention that your honor, while in 
          private practice, previously 
          represented the town of Seal Beach 
          in their stop-work suit against the 
          Police Department of Seal Beach.  We 
          believe this disqualifies you from 
          hearing this case and we therefore 
          move for a temporary suspension while 
          this is investigated.

     The judge is surprised to hear this.

                    JUDGE
          Mr. Adler, this is a most unusual 
          motion.

                    ADLER
          Nonetheless, your honor, we feel 
          that our client deserves every 
          fairness afforded under the law.

                    JUDGE
          If this is in any way designed to 
          delay the testimony of Eduardo Ruiz...

     The judge considers.

                    JUDGE
          We'll recess until 9:00 am Monday 
          morning.  And I'll see counsel in 
          chambers.

     He slams the gavel down again.

     EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

     Gordon, Castro, other AGENTS and Ruiz come down the rear 
     steps of the courthouse and walk across the street toward 
     the parking lot.

                    CASTRO
          Remember when we sat on that mob 
          guy, that chef, for like six months?

                    GORDON
          Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in 
          my life.
               (to Ruiz)
          Why don't you develop a useful skill?

                    CASTRO
          Yeah, like turning into a beautiful 
          woman.

     They reach the car.

                    RUIZ
          Would you mind if today we walked?  
          It's one block.  I could use the 
          fresh air.

     INT. FRANCISCO'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

     Across the street, Francisco, encrypted cell phone to his 
     ear, watches from his own car as Gordon, Castro, and Ruiz 
     stand by their car without getting in, then walk away from 
     the car.

                    FRANCISCO
               (into phone)
          They're not getting into the car.  
          What are they doing?  They're walking 
          right at me.

     The men start across the street toward Francisco.

     INT. HELENA'S CAR - DAY

     Helena drives her car through downtown San Diego.

                    HELENA
               (into phone)
          You've got a gun.  Get out of the 
          car and shoot him in the head.

     INT. FRANCISCO'S CAR - DAY

     Francisco watches Ruiz and the agents walk up the street 
     toward him.

                    FRANCISCO
               (into phone)
          They're going to walk right past me.

                    HELENA (V.O.)
          What are you?  A mouse?  Get out of 
          the car and do it.  This is your 
          chance.

     Francisco watches the three men walk past his car.  He makes 
     a decision and opens his door.

     EXT. STREET - DAY

     Francisco steps from the car and mingles in with OTHER PEOPLE 
     walking along the sidewalk.  He follows them for few yards, 
     picking his moment.

     He closes the distance to Gordon, Castro and Ruiz, pulling a 
     pistol from inside his jacket.  He takes careful aim from 
     twelve feet away and is about to shoot Ruiz when a bullet 
     hole appears in his chest.  He staggers, trying to squeeze 
     the trigger, Francisco fires the gun once, wildly --

     A tourist screams --

     Gordon and Castro and Ruiz turn --

     Francisco is looking down at the widening red splotch in the 
     center of his shirt, uncertain of what has happened --

     Gordon shoves Ruiz down into a doorway and fires three quick 
     shots --

     Francisco spins around and drops on his face in the street.

     Citizens run in all directions fearing a psychopath with an 
     NRA card coming off a bad week of day-trading --

     Gordon and Castro with Ruiz beneath them scan the streets.

                    CASTRO
          Stay here.  I'll get the car.

     Castro runs down the street for the court parking lot.  Other 
     AGENTS are running toward Gordon and Ruiz.

     INT. OFFICE BUILDING WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

     The STRANGE MAN who threatened Helena's children packs a 
     high-caliber rifle and scope into a briefcase.

     He snaps the case shut and quickly exits the room.  We notice 
     a man on the floor with a bullet hole in his head next to 
     the open door.

     EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

     Agents surround Ruiz.

     Gordon walks to the body of Francisco lying face down in the 
     gutter.  He turns him over with his shoe and sees his face.

                    GORDON
               (to the other agents)
          I saw this guy at the courthouse.
               (beat)
          The car --

     Gordon takes off running, yelling for Castro.

     EXT. COURT PARKING LOT - DAY

     Castro has reached the car and gets in.

     Gordon appears at the gate of the lot --

                    GORDON
               (yelling)
          No --

     INT. CRUISER - DAY

     Castro turns the ignition exactly at the moment he sees Gordon 
     yelling and waving his arms --

     EXT. COURT PARKING LOT - DAY

     The cruiser EXPLODES.

     Gordon hits the pavement.  Parts of the car begin raining 
     down around him.

     INT. SIDEWALK CAFE - SAN DIEGO - DAY

     A fire truck and paramedic unit WHIZZES by.  Manolo sits at 
     an outdoor cafe table, waiting.  He can't help looking around 
     at the attractive people, but he's also nervous.

     Suddenly two MEN, recognizable as Salazar's OFFICERS from 
     the desert drug bust, sitting at a nearby table, rise and 
     move to Manolo's table.

                    MAN #1
          Manolo, how are you?

     They take seats uncomfortably close to Manolo.

                    MAN #2
          Manolo, have we interrupted?

     You're looking around like you're expecting someone.

                    MANOLO
          No.  I'm looking for the waiter.  I 
          want to order.

                    MAN #1
          What are you gonna have?

                    MANOLO
          A steak.

                    MAN #1
          Well, if you like steak, we know a 
          much better place.  We'll take you 
          there.

                    MANOLO
          That's okay, really.

     They each take Manolo by an arm.

                    MAN #2
          Manolo, we should really be going 
          now, before it gets too crowded.

     INT. SUV - DAY

     We're looking through the windshield as we approach the 
     Mexican border.  As the car slows, we pan to follow the border 
     official as he looks in briefly and waves us through.  We 
     continue to pan to reveal Manolo in the backseat sitting 
     beside Man #2.

     INT. SUV - DAY

     We're in the desert.  There's nothing in any directions.

     Javi is implacable.  Manolo understands what is happening.

                    MANOLO
          I was going to feed them wrong 
          information.  Feed them lies to...  
          it was for...

     The men say nothing.  After a beat --

                    MANOLO
          Don't tell Anna I died like this.  
          Tell her it was something else.  
          Tell her it was official business.  
          Tell her that I died doing something 
          honorable.  Please, tell her that 
          for me...

     EXT. DESERT - DAY

     Javi and Manolo stand next to two freshly dug graves.

                    MAN #1
          Turn around.

     Javi hesitates before turning.  We're on Javi as we hear the 
     GUNSHOT.  Javi doesn't flinch.  Manolo's body falls into the 
     grave.

     Javi stands there, waiting.

                    MAN #1
          You got anything you want to say?

     Javi shakes his head.  Finally, another GUNSHOT.  After a 
     beat, a hand reaches out of Javi's shoulder.

                    MAN #1
          Sorry about that... we had to be 
          sure.

     They walk back to the SUV.

                    SOMEBODY ELSE
          Are you sure you don't have anything 
          to tell us?

     Javi says nothing, doesn't even acknowledge them.  We hear a 
     GUNSHOT.

     Arnie Metzger is in Helena's living room.  The stereo is 
     loudly playing MOZART.

                    ARNIE
          That was a stupid thing you did.  
          Incredibly stupid.

                    HELENA
          I tried, Arnie.  And, I will continue 
          to try.

                    ARNIE
          Have you gone crazy?  You are not 
          Carl.  You aren't as good as Carl.
               (beat)
          They are moving the trial to a high 
          security location.  The press has 
          gone berserk.  The jury will be 
          influenced.  Stay out of things.  
          Let us try to win the case.

                    HELENA
          That is going to be rather difficult 
          when all the evidence is against us.

     Helena steps closer to Arnie, close enough that her breasts 
     are almost touching his chest.

                    ARNIE
          Helena, please.  This is out of your 
          hands.

                    HELENA

          that and I'm sorry, but Arnie I need 
          something from you.  Something only 
          you can help me with.

     This is a professional chemical lab that can be rented by

     Helena lets herself into the room.  She scans ledgers. She

     INT. CAROLINE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Robert is standing in the middle of her room.  He's not sure 
     what he's looking for.  Everywhere he looks: her personal 
     things, beloved objects from more innocent times, pictures.

     Within moments a legitimate desire to connect with his 
     daughter has escalated into a search for clues.  He opens 
     her drawers, dumps little boxes, pulls things off of shelves.

     He becomes increasingly unhinged, flinging things around her 
     room.  He tosses a stack of magazines.  A fashion magazine, 
     airborne, discharges some contents: a lighter, a plastic 
     tube and a piece of folded aluminum foil fluttering to the 
     ground.

     Robert stares at the foil on the carpet.  It's charred on 
     the outside.  He picks it up.  And unfolds it.  There's a 
     dried milky white substance.

     He picks up the tube and lighter and stares at them.  Then, 
     somewhat tentatively, he puts the tube in his mouth.  He 
     holds the lighter under the foil, then heats the milky 
     substance which turns translucent and disappears in a cloud 
     of smoke.  Robert sucks all of it in.

     He waits a long time then exhales.  His eyes shut.  The tube 
     drops from his mouth.  He staggers and, overwhelmed by the 
     sensations, sits on the bed.  The lighter and foil fall from 
     his hands.

     A moment later he opens his eyes and doesn't seem to know 
     where he is.  He looks at the room, confused.  He stumbles 
     to the door and shuts it firmly behind him.

     A shrewd Obregon Lieutenant, JUAN MARQUEZ, 40, sits at a 
     table opposite Helena.  The Strange Man who both threatened 
     Helena's child and executed Francisco sits in another chair.

                    MARQUEZ
          Mrs. Ayala.  Thank you for coming.  
          I am Juan Marquez, I work for Mr.  
          Obregon.  I believe you know my 
          associate, "Tigrillo," the Little 
          Tiger.

     Helena nods to Tigrillo --

                    HELENA
          Yes, he threatened to kill my five 
          year-old son.
               (beat)
          I was under the impression I would

          thank you for coming down here, though 
          I suspect it's been a pointless 
          journey.

                    HELENA
          Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?

                    MARQUEZ
          I hear these stories.  Your husband 
          in jail.  His business in chaos.  
          Various people fighting over the 
          scraps.

                    HELENA
          My husband is the victim of an 
          informer in your organization, not 
          ours.

                    MARQUEZ
          That is not true, Mrs. Ayala.  Your 
          route is compromised.  Perhaps it is 
          time for me to deal with other 
          distributors in California.

                    HELENA
          I don't think you're going to do 
          that.

                    MARQUEZ
          You don't?  Listen to this woman in 
          a man's world, a very violent world.

                    HELENA
          There are plenty of other suppliers 
          in Mexico.

                    MARQUEZ
          But not in whose interest it is to 
          help you out of debt.

     Helena reaches into her bag and pulls out the Spastic Jack 
     action figure.  She puts it on the desk.

                    HELENA
          My husband had been working on 
          something he called, The Project for 
          the Children.  Are you aware of this?

                    MARQUEZ
          I don't know.  Perhaps I remember 
          something.

                    HELENA
          We have the ability to change the 
          color, odor, and physical property 
          of cocaine.

                    MARQUEZ
          You want to smuggle narcotics in Mr.  
          Espastico Jacobo.  That's nothing 
          new.

                    HELENA
          Not in...

     Juan Marquez is confused.

                    HELENA
          This doll is cocaine.

     Juan picks up Spastic Jack and looks at him.  He bangs it on 
     the desk.

                    HELENA
          Every part, from his ears to his 
          accessory belt, is high-impact, 
          pressure-molded cocaine.  Odorless.  
          Undetectable by dogs.  Undetectable 
          by anyone.

                    MARQUEZ
          I don't believe you.

     She takes out the "solvent" and puts it on his desk.

     Spastic Jack is slowly dissolving in a bowl of solvent.  
     Only his shoulders, head, and ridiculous ears remain above 
     the quicksand of milky glop.

     Helena holds a mirror under the desk lamp.  She is drying 
     the paste.  She puts the mirror on the desk.  A white 
     substance has coagulated there.

                    HELENA
          Try it.

     Juan takes out a razor blade and chops the dried substance 
     into two white powder lines.  He hands a silver straw to 
     Helena.

                    MARQUEZ
          You first.

                    HELENA
          I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do 
          it.

          Fine, then we don't have a deal.

     She stands.  He watches her a beat, then smiles.

     He leans down and quickly snorts a line.  After a beat.

          That's good coke.

                    HELENA
          It should be... It's yours.
               (beat)
          I want our debt forgiven.  I want to 
          be the exclusive distributor of 
          Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the 
          United States.  And I want the 
          principle witness against my husband, 
          Eduardo Ruiz, killed.

                    MARQUEZ
          Perhaps... Perhaps... I'm afraid I 
          must first ask you to pass a test.  
          I asked the same of your husband and 
          he succeeded with flying colors.

     Helena waits.  Juan Marquez reaches in his desk and pulls 
     out a quarter kilo of cocaine.  He pushes it across the desk.

                    MARQUEZ
          Take this back with you.  Deliver it 
          safely to Tigrillo in San Diego and 
          we have a deal.

                    HELENA
          That's crazy.  My husband is on trial 
          for smuggling.

                    MARQUEZ
          Exactly, and this is how I know I'm 
          not getting into business with the 
          U.S. Government.

     She puts the quarter key in her bag and stands.

                    HELENA
          You will help me with my other 
          problem.

                    MARQUEZ
          Deliver that safely to Tigrillo in 
          San Diego.  And we have a deal.

     Tigrillo escorts her out of the room.

     INT. CLUB PLATINUM - DAY

     Helena follows Tigrillo.  As they pass the restrooms she 
     signals that she has to stop.

     INT. CLUB PLATINUM - LADIES' ROOM - DAY

     Helena goes into a stall.  She extracts the cocaine from her 
     handbag.

     She looks at it, trying to figure out where it goes.  She 
     hikes up her skirt.

     INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

     Javier is hooked up to a polygraph machine watched closely 
     by a POLYGRAPH OPERATOR.  Hughes and Johnson watch as Javi 
     talks into a tape recorder on the table.

                    JAVIER
          ...And I have the electronic serial 
          numbers for their cellular phones.  
          They change them every twenty-four 
          hours but I have a contact at MexTel 
          who can get me the new ESNs within 
          twelve.

     Javi finishes talking and sits back.  Agent Hughes shuts off 
     the tape recorder and looks at the polygraph operator who 
     nods approval.  Hughes and Johnson exchange a look.  They 
     are dumbstruck.

                    HUGHES
          That's good shit.

                    JAVIER
          Now that you have what you want, 
          let's talk about how I get what I 
          want.

                    JOHNSON
          Oh, don't worry, Javier, you're not 
          gonna have any problems there.

                    HUGHES
          I want to take a minute and talk 
          about what type of precautions you're 
          taking to protect yourself.  When 
          Salazar and Madrigal go down, they 
          might send someone to see you.

                    JAVIER
          You worry about getting me the things 
          that I want.  I'll worry about myself.

     There's a beat.  Javier seems discomfited.  The two agents 
     notice this and exchange looks.

                    JOHNSON
          You should feel good about this.

                    JAVIER
          I feel like a traitor.

     EXT. BORDER CROSSING AUTOMOBILE CHECKPOINT - DAY

     Javi goes into Mexico.  Pan over to Helena's Mercedes.

     INT. HELENA'S CAR - DAY

     She inches the car forward towards the officer who selects 
     vehicles for inspection.  The car ahead of her passes through 
     and speeds away.  The OFFICER flags Helena and directs her 
     into the search facility.

     EXT. CUSTOMS SEARCH BAY - DAY

     Helena pulls into a search bay.

     A CUSTOMS OFFICER watches Helena lower her window.

                    CUSTOMS OFFICER
          Please step from the car, Ma'am.

                    HELENA
          I'm in a hurry --

                    CUSTOMS OFFICER
          Step from the car, Ma'am.  This won't 
          take long from your day.

     Helena gets out of her car.

     INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CUSTOMS CHECKPOINT - DAY

     There is a bank of video monitors showing the scenes all 
     over the facility.

     ON THE MONITOR: Helena's car is on a lift three feet off the 
     ground.  Officers pour over the inside and undercarriage of 
     the Mercedes.

     Nearby, A GERMAN SHEPHERD sniffs at the items that have been 
     removed from the car: bags, spare tire, cd boxes.

     EXT. CUSTOMS SEARCH BAY - DAY

     Customs OFFICERS approach Helena --

                    OFFICER
          Ma'am, we have to ask you to come 
          with us.

     She follows them toward the Customs building.

     INT. STRIP SEARCH ROOM - DAY

     A FEMALE CUSTOMS INSPECTOR accompanied by a female SUPERVISORY 
     INSPECTOR leads Helena into a sterile room where there is no 
     place to hide anything.

                    CUSTOMS MATRON
          Ma'am, we have reason to believe you 
          may have illegal drugs hidden beneath 
          your clothing.  I need to conduct a 
          pat down search.  Supervisory 
          Inspector Haig will witness the 
          search.

                    HELENA
          You've got to be kidding me.  I'm 
          pregnant.  What if I refuse?

                    CUSTOMS MATRON
          This pamphlet explains the law and 
          your rights under it.  You're welcome

     EXT. FUNERAL SERVICE - DAY

     Hundreds of DEA AGENTS, spouses, others stand around a grave 
     in a leafy cemetery in working class San Diego.

     EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

     The funeral is over and people are filing back to the cars.  
     Gordon walks away from the service when he is approached by 
     a mourning LUCINDA CASTRO, the mother of the deceased.

                    MRS. CASTRO
          Montel... Oh, Montel.

     Gordon hugs her.

                    MRS. CASTRO
          You know how much he cared about 
          you.  You do, don't you?

                    GORDON
          Yes.

                    MRS. CASTRO
          I know if he could have it back 
          somehow, he wouldn't do it differently 
          or have it any other way.  He 
          wouldn't.  He loved his job.

     Another AGENT hustles toward him from the other direction, 
     the direction of the cars.

                    AGENT
          Excuse me, Agent Gordon.  Mrs.  
          Castro.
               (to Gordon)
          Helena Ayala left Club Platinum in 
          Tijuana.  The Obregon Brothers' place.  
          They stopped her at the border but 
          she was clean.  She's in San Diego 
          now.

     Gordon runs for his car.

     INT. ARNIE METZGER'S OFFICE - DAY

     Arnie sits in his office, spacing out, admiring his view 
     when an ASSISTANT shows Helena in.  As soon as the door shuts --

                    HELENA
          Did you get it?

                    ARNIE
          What are you thinking, calling me at 
          home with a message like that?  You've 
          compromised me and our relationship --

     Helena sits confidently on his couch.

                    HELENA
               (making fun of Arnie)
          The place is swept twice a day.  I 
          learned that down in Miami in '85...
               (hard)
          Arnie.  I'm the housewife.  I belong 
          to the most exclusive country club 
          in La Jolla that accepts Latinos.  
          Until recently, I believed my husband 
          imported hydroponic strawberries, 
          which I donated at the school fair.

     Arnie reaches into a desk drawer and pulls out a quarter- 
     kilo baggy identical to the one Juan Obregon gave her in 
     Tijuana.

                    HELENA
          It's the same stuff?  From the rainy 
          day stash?

                    ARNIE
          It's the same.  What happened to 
          what they gave you?

     Helena puts the bag in her purse.

                    HELENA
          I'm desperate, but I'm not stupid.

     I flushed it in the bathroom of their godawful nightclub.

     INT. ROBERT AND BARBARA'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

     Robert sleeps in his clothes on top of the covers.  Barbara 
     is asleep beside him.  The phone rings.  Robert answers.  
     Barbara watches.

                    ROBERT
          Hello.

                    SHERIDAN (V.O.)
          I'm sorry... Did I wake you?

     Robert looks at Barbara and shakes his head.  She gets up.

                    ROBERT
          No, it's all right.

     There's a beat.

                    SHERIDAN (V.O.)
          Salazar's been taken down.  He was 
          working for Porfirio Madrigal.

                    ROBERT
          What?  I thought Madrigal was dead.  
          I thought it was verified.

                    SHERIDAN (V.O.)
          Apparently not.  Look, it's a shit 
          storm here right now.  When are you 
          coming back?

          more.

                    SHERIDAN (V.O.)
          If we're moving the press conference, 
          we need to do it now.

     The tone in Barbara's voice causes him to look up.  She holds 
     an empty jewelry box.

          I have to call you back.

     INT. DINING ROOM - EARLY MORNING

     The drawers and cabinets are open.  Barbara and Robert assess

          drugs?  What kind of effect you think 
          this has on the psyche of a black 
          person, on their possibilities?  If 
          you sent a hundred thousand black 
          people into your neighborhood, Indian 
          Hills, and they asked every white 
          person they saw, hey, you got any 
          drugs?, within a day, your friends 
          and their kids would be selling.  
          It's market forces, man.  The 
          product's marked up three hundred 
          percent.  You can go out on the street 
          and make five hundred bucks in two 
          hours and then do whatever you want 
          for the rest of the day.  You think

          I want to believe you.  I really do.

          You will believe me, because it's 
          true.

     EXT. SKETCH'S APARTMENT - DAY

     Seth walks up the steps and into the building.  A beat later 
     he reappears and continues down the street.

     Robert emerges from across the street and follows at a guarded 
     distance.

     EXT. STREETS - DAY

     Seth walks along the seedy neighborhood street.  He approaches 
     the Villa Elaine.  He turns up the steps and disappears 
     inside.

     Robert follows him.

     INT. VILLA ELAINE HALLWAY - DAY

     Robert ascends the stairs.  As he enters the hallway he sees 
     Seth pounding on one of the doors.

                    SETH
          Open the door.  Open the fucking 
          door, man.

     A MAN'S VOICE comes from the other side of the door.

                    MUFFLED VOICE
          Go away!

     Robert closes the distance.  Seth pounds harder.

                    SETH
          I know she's in there.  Let me talk 
          to her.

                    MUFFLED VOICE
          I don't know what you're talking 
          about.  Go away!

     Robert reaches the door.  Seth sees him.

                    SETH
          I know she's in there.

     Robert kicks the door in.

     INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

     Robert sees a middle-aged JOHN in his underwear and a dress 
     shirt.

                    JOHN
          Hey, I haven't touched her --

     Caroline is passed out on the bed.  Robert goes to her as 
     the John scrambles for his clothes.

     She stirs and sees him --

                    CAROLINE
               (really out of it)
          Hi, Daddy.

     INT. ROBERT'S CAR - DAY

     Caroline rides in the passenger seat.  She's come out of her 
     stupor and is now filled with ebullience.

                    CAROLINE
          It's gonna be great...  I mean, I'm 
          okay and all, because, see, I met a 
          guy, he's in this pretty famous band 
          and...
               (gets up confessional 
               courage)
          They've invited me to write lyrics 
          for them, I'm gonna be able to do 
          that and maybe sing, too... not at 
          first, but later.

     Caroline gets lost in her grandiose vision.  Robert looks 
     over at her as she drifts off into a nod.  A moment later 
     she's awake and rambling again.

                    CAROLINE
               (sounding completely 
               crazy)
          I've been doing research for the 
          school paper, that's what I've been 
          doing, like on assignment kind-of, 
          I've seen some stuff you wouldn't 
          believe, but I'm gonna write it all 
          down into lyrics.  They think I'm 
          really good, everybody says so, what 
          do you think?

     Robert fights back tears.  He reaches over and takes his 
     daughter's hand.

     INT. CLUB PLATINUM OFFICE - DAY

     Juan Marquez sits across the desk from Javi.  Tigrillo and 
     PABLO, 30's, are also in the meeting.

                    MARQUEZ
          Salazar and Madrigal are no longer 
          with us.
               (beat)
          A feat none of these people could 
          get accomplished.

     Juan nods toward Pablo and Tigrillo.

                    MARQUEZ
          You're going to be made the Special 
          Assistant to the new drug Czar, which 
          makes you a very valuable law 
          enforcement officer.

          I hope you like to travel because we 
          have plans for Juarez and El Paso, 
          Nogales, Sinaloa, Jalisco,

     INT. BARBARA'S OFFICE - DAY

     A cramped, messy office at the Environmental Protection 
     Agency.  Barbara is on the phone.

                    BARBARA
               (into phone)
          I'm really not sure.  She seemed to 
          recognize it wasn't Serenity Oaks.  
          It's a pretty hard-core facility, 
          but at least we know where she is.
               (beat)
          Maybe it's what she needs now.

     INTERCUT ROBERT IN HIS OFFICE

     He holds the phone and doesn't say anything.

     INT. COURTROOM - EARLY MORNING

     The court is searched carefully by a phalanx of OFFICERS.  
     Metal Detectors are checked.  Bomb sniffing German Shepherds 
     are led through the space.

     INT. HOTEL SUITE - MORNING

     The agents are unkempt and everyone is tired.  Ruiz moves 
     through a cluttered room in a bathrobe with a cup of coffee.

     An agent shows him a morning paper --

                    AGENT
          Big day.
               (shows picture in 
               paper)
          You're a star.

     Ruiz walks over and sits across from Gordon, switching off 
     the radio show he's listening to.  Gordon looks up from his 
     paper.

                    GORDON
          Go shower.  You smell.

     There is a KNOCK on the front door.  An AGENT goes to answer --

                    AGENT
          Who is it?

                    SOMEBODY (V.O.)
               (through the door)
          The Mafia.  I've got his breakfast.

     The agent opens the door and is handed a breakfast tray.  He 
     puts the food in front of Ruiz who uncovers the sausage and 
     eggs.

     An agent walking by tries to take a bite of sausage.  Ruiz 
     stabs it with a fork --

                    RUIZ
          Fuck off.

     Gordon watches the interchange --

                    GORDON
          Where's the love gone, Eddie?

     You'll be testifying for at least ten days.  What if we stop 
     feeding you?

     Ruiz begins to eat hungrily.

                    RUIZ
          You expect me to be grateful for 
          spending the rest of my life looking 
          over my shoulder.

                    GORDON
          That thought makes me feel awful.

     Ruiz pushes eggs into a piece of toast.

                    RUIZ
          Can't you for a second imagine none 
          of this had happened?  That my drugs 
          had gone through.  What would have 
          been the harm?  A few people get 
          high who are getting high anyway.  
          Your partner is still alive.  We 
          avoid having breakfast together.  
          Don't you see this means nothing?  
          That your whole life is pointless?

                    GORDON
          You're breaking my heart.

                    RUIZ
          The worst thing about you, Monty, is 
          you realize the futility of what 
          you're doing and you do it anyway.  
          I wish you could see how transparent 
          you are.
               (disgusted)
          This food tastes like shit.

                    GORDON
          So go shower already.

                    RUIZ
          You only got to me because you were 
          tipped off by the Juarez Cartel, 
          who's trying to break into Tijuana.  
          You're helping them.
               (beat)
          You work for a drug dealer too, Monty.

     Ruiz stands and heads for the bathroom.

                    GORDON
               (yelling after him)
          And shave.  You better look nice and 
          believable for the jury.

     Ruiz disappears into the bathroom and slams the door behind 
     him.

                    GORDON
               (to another agent)
          It's like having another wife.

     The agent laughs.  There's another KNOCK on the door.

                    GORDON
          Who is it?

                    SOMEBODY ELSE (V.O.)
               (though the door)
          Breakfast.

     Gordon and the agent look at each other.

                    SOMEBODY ELSE
          Hurry up.  It's getting cold.

     Gordon moves to the side of the door and pulls his gun.  The 
     other agent opens the door.

     A MAN with a breakfast tray enters.  Gordon puts the gun to 
     the side of his head.

                    MAN WITH TRAY
          I'm on your side.  God, you're jumpy.

     Gordon is momentarily confused, then goes for the bathroom 
     door.

                    GORDON
          Call an ambulance.  Hurry.

     Gordon tries the bathroom door.  It's stuck.  He gets it 
     open a crack.  There's a body against the other side.  He 
     shoves.

     INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Ruiz is on the floor in convulsions.

                    GORDON
               (yelling)
          Call the ambulance.
               (to Ruiz)
          Don't die on me.  You will not die 
          on me.  Do you hear me?  Don't you 
          die on me.

     Ruiz's convulsions get worse, his claw-like fingers scratch 
     across the tile.

                    CHIEF OF STAFF
          Yeah, hi --
               (waves Robert to a

          So I've got a copy of your speech

          It's fantastic... So, Robert, my 
          genuine thanks.  You're my choice 
          and you're gonna be great.  The 
          President is sorry he hasn't been

          to really sit down.
               (an afterthought)
          Oh, I got to the Post, too.  Don't 
          worry about that thing with your 
          daughter, it's not news; they're

               (off Robert's stare)
          Look, even if it came out, we'd turn

     It's a reprise of the earlier desert bust... a landing strip

     are trailing behind him.

     EXT. DESERT AIRSTRIP - LATER

     Javi and Special Agent Hughes stand next to a giant mound of 
     seized cocaine, the same cocaine, in fact, Javi held briefly 
     at the beginning.  The same teenagers from the pickup truck 
     have been arrested.  The news crews get everything.

     envelope.  The crates of cocaine are clearly marked "911."

                    ROBERT
          The cocaine brand, 911, is an East 
          Coast brand, a Juarez Cartel brand, 
          and you must know it usually comes 
          through into El Paso?

                    ROBERT
          So what's it doing in Tijuana?

     Javi looks Robert Wakefield squarely in the eye.  He shrugs.

                    ROBERT
          Let me ask you a hypothetical 
          question: if Salazar worked for 
          Madrigal and the Juaraz cartel, and 
          he went out of power, would it mean 
          the Juarez Cartel is losing influence?

                    JAVIER
          It could mean that, yes.

                    ROBERT
          That would probably mean the Tijuana 
          Cartel is gaining power?

                    JAVIER
          It's possible.

                    ROBERT
          Is it possible to have a Drug Czar 
          in Mexico who isn't connected in 
          some war to one of the cartels?

     Javi thinks along time before answering.

          Yeah, it's possible... if you're

     Helena circles through the crowd greeting friends.  She looks 
     past her tree line and up the street where a telephone repair 
     van is parked.  She turns back toward her guests.  Somebody 
     has raised a cup and everyone is CHEERING.

     Helena drinks with her guests, then walks inside her house.

     AT THE FRONT GATE

     Montel Gordon walks through the gate and up the drive.  He

          What?

          tell me about the 3 million dollars 
          we got in from San Francisco two 
          days after I got arrested?

          time.

                    CARLOS
          And you didn't feel like you could 
          trust my wife with this news?

                    ARNIE (V.O.)
          I just didn't want to take a chance.  
          I didn't want to risk it.  It could 
          have been frozen along with everything 
          else.

                    CARLOS
          You had it all figured out.  You 
          move into my house.  You raise my 
          kids.  You sleep with my wife.  It 
          was a good plan, Arnie.

          Carl, that's insane.

                    CARLOS
          So my wife is lying?

                    ARNIE (V.O.)
          Carl, think about it, if I was trying 
          to rip you off, I would have left 
          town after Ruiz was killed.  I 
          wouldn't sit next to you in court

          between a reason and an excuse, 
          because I don't think there is.

                    ARNIE (V.O.)
          Carl --

                    CARLOS
          Goodbye Arnie.

     INT. ARNIE METZGER'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

     Arnie turns around and there are TWO MEN in his office.

     INT. CARL'S PRIVATE STUDY - AFTERNOON

     Carl hears MUFFLED GUNSHOTS over the phone.  He hangs up and 
     turns from the window.  Helena is standing there.

                    HELENA
          Who was that?

                    CARLOS
          Arnie.  He's not going to be able to 
          make the barbecue.

     Carl and Helena share an embrace and a kiss.

                    HELENA
          Come downstairs.  Everyone is waiting.

     Carl and Helena turn to leave the room and Montel Gordon is 
     standing in the doorway with his glass of champagne.

                    GORDON
          Hello, Helena.  What a great party.

                    CARLOS
          Who are you?

                    GORDON
          Nobody.  I'm a nobody who arrested 
          you, but your wife is a murderer.

     Gordon takes a sip of his drink.  Two SECURITY OFFICERS appear 
     in the doorway behind him.

                    SECURITY OFFICER
          Hey, you can't be in here.

                    GORDON
          I'm a cop.

                    SECURITY OFFICER
          I don't care.

                    HELENA
               (to the guards)
          Throw him out of here.

     The security officers grab Gordon.  There is a scuffle.  
     Gordon falls to the floor by the window.  They are wrestling.

     As they wrestle, Gordon reaches out and, unnoticed, affixes 
     TINY LISTENING DEVICE underneath the desk.

     He continues to struggle with the guards.  Helena and Carlos 
     start from the room.

                    GORDON
               (calling out)
          You didn't win, Helena.  You lost 
          everything.  Tell your children a 
          nice bedtime story...  How you killed 
          my partner.

     EXT. AYALA FRONT YARD - AFTERNOON

     The guests watch as the guards eject Gordon from the premises.

     Near the gate David has stopped playing to watch the action.

     Then he goes back to playing with his toy: a Spastic Jack 
     figure.

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. VERDANT NEIGHBORHOOD - MEXICO CITY - DAY

     Javi and his convoy of armored SUV's pull up in front of the 
     beautiful house where earlier he deposited Rosario, Salazar's 
     former mistress.

     Javier opens the front door and Rosario greets him by throwing 
     her arms around his neck.  They disappear inside.

                                   CUT TO:

     INT. WHITE HOUSE PRESS ROOM - DAY

     The PRESS SECRETARY stands at the familiar podium addressing 
     the White House Press Corps.

     Robert Wakefield stands to one side with Chief of Staff, his 
     lawyers, Sheridan and General Landry.

                    PRESS SECRETARY
          ...a sterling reputation and close 
          friend of the President, recently 
          confirmed into The Office of National 
          Drug Control Policy... our new Drug 
          Czar, Robert Hudson Wakefield.

     Applause from the assembled PRESS.  The Press Secretary 
     signals and Robert walks to the podium.  He looks back to 
     the Chief of Staff; he stares out at the expectant faces and 
     television lights and camera flashes.

                    ROBERT
               (reading his prepared 
               speech)
          The War on Drugs is a war on our 
          nation's most precious resource...  
          our children.  Sixty-eight million 
          children have been targeted by those 
          who perpetrate this war and protecting 
          those children must be priority number 
          one.
               (beat)
          There has been progress and there 
          have been failures, but where we 
          have fallen short I see not a problem 
          but an opportunity.

     Robert is becoming increasingly uneasy.  He glances at the 
     Chief of Staff who bores into him.  He looks again at his 
     speech.  With great effort he continues.

                    ROBERT
          An opportunity to correct the mistakes 
          of the past while laying a solid 
          foundation for the future.
               (a long, uncomfortable 
               beat)
          This takes not only new ideas, but 
          perseverance.  This takes not only 
          resources, but courage.  This takes 
          not only government, but families.

     Robert stops again as though the words are choking him.

                    ROBERT
          I've... I've outlined a ten-point 
          plan, representing a new bilateral 
          effort...

     He can't finish.  Everyone stares at Robert.  The crowd of 
     reporters senses something is wrong.

                    ROBERT
          I can't do this.
               (beat)
          If there is a War on Drugs then our 
          own families have become the enemy.  
          How can you wage war on your own 
          family?

     He walks out of the room.  The crowd waits, expecting him to 
     return.

     Robert walks down a corridor and out of the White House.

     EXT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

     A beautiful spring morning.  He walks down to Pennsylvania 
     Avenue.  He hails a cab and gets in.  The cab pulls away.

     INT. CHURCH BASEMENT - DAY

     A twelve step meeting is in progress.  Caroline shares from 
     her seat.

                    CAROLINE
          On the good days I feel like I get 
          it, like it all makes sense.  I can 
          stay in the moment.  I don't have to 
          control everything in the future.  
          And I believe everything is going to 
          work out fine.
               (beat)
          On the bad days, I just want to grab 
          the phone and start dialing numbers.  
          I want to pull my hair and run through 
          the streets screaming.
               (beat)
          But, thanks to the people I've met 
          in these rooms, people like Margaret 
          and Jim and Sarah, people who've 
          taught me how to listen, I'm pretty 
          sure I'll make it through today.

     Caroline is finished sharing.

                    VOICE (O.S.)
          Would you like to share?

     We pan over to reveal Robert and Barbara sitting next to 
     Caroline.

                    ROBERT
          My name is Robert.  This is my wife, 
          Barbara.  We're Caroline's parents.  
          We're just hear to listen.

                                   CUT TO:

     OMIT.

     EXT. AYALA HOME - NIGHT

     The house is dark and silent.  The van is parked up the 
     street.

     INT. VAN - NIGHT

     Gordon listens through a headset, his expression set.

                    CARLOS (V.O.)
               (over a listening 
               device)
          We're back up and running.
          Completely untouchable.  Completely.

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - TIJUANA - DAY

     A bank of lights CRANKS on.  Then ANOTHER and ANOTHER.

     In a wider shot we see an illuminated baseball field where a 
     children's pickup game is in progress.

     In the crowd, Javi serenely watches the game.

     THE END
