Having left the Army following W.W.II, Bob Wallace and Phil Davis team up to become a top song-and-dance act.
Davis plays matchmaker and introduces Wallace to a pair of beautiful sisters (Betty and Judy) who also have a song-and-dance act.
When Betty and Judy travel to a Vermont lodge to perform a Christmas show, Wallace and Davis follow, only to find their former commander, General Waverly, as the lodge owner.
A series of romantic mix-ups ensue as the performers try to help the General.
