<b>AS CREDITS ROLL
</b>
<b>EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT
</b>
We see a clean moving POV illuminated by headlights.  We're 
floating down an old two-lane highway through a desolate, 
desert landscape.  This gliding, eerie POV continues as 
credits roll. when the credits end, the headlights seem to 
dim and soon we're moving through BLACKNESS.

</b>
<b>INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
in the blackness, a man, FRED, is sitting on a bed smoking a 
cigarette. we see his back, but with each glow of the 
cigarette ash, we see his face reflected in a mirror on the 
wall across from him.  In the darkness, there starts the 
sound of a motor which draws curtains back across a large 
picture window just off screen.  As the curtain moves, hard-edged 
light begins crawling across the room, and we see 
everything clearly.  Fred is wearing a robe and pajamas, it's 
early morning.

CLOSE UP ON FRED'S FACE IN THE MIRROR - Blank expression - 
face somewhat obscured or distorted by smoke from the 
cigarette.

CLOSE UP 0N FRED'S ACTUAL FACE - Unshaven, haggard look, eyes 
seem empty, glazed over.  Fred is 32 years old, with dark
hair.

THE DOORBELL RINGS.  Fred looks up, startled by the noise.  
He looks at the digital clock: 5:30 a.m.

FRED STANDS, goes to an INTERCOM on the wall next to the 
mirror.  He pushes a button.

A VOICE comes over the intercom.

<b>				VOICE OVER
</b><b>				INTERCOM
</b>		Dick Laurent is dead.

Fred leaves the bedroom and goes through the house.  He is on 
the upstairs level.  He looks through a narrow slot window, 
but can't see the front door below.  He goes further in the 
house to a picture window that overlooks the street below.  
There is NOBODY there.

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>


<b>EXT. THE MADISON HOUSE - DAY
</b>
We can see Fred standing at the picture window, looking out.

</b>
<b>INT.  THE MADISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Fred is dressed to go out: Black sport coat and slacks, 
buttoned up white shirt.  He picks up a music case.  A woman 
comes into the room.  This is Fred's wife, RENEE, 30 years 
old, dark hair, dressed smartly, a drink in her hand.

<b>				RENEE
</b>		You don't mind that I'm not coming
		tonight?

<b>				FRED
</b>		What are you going to do?

<b>				RENEE
</b>		I thought I'd stay home and read.

Fred looks her over, she's sexy without trying.

<b>				FRED
</b>		Read?... Read what, Renee?

Renee sits down on a couch and sips her drink.  Fred comes 
over to her, kisses her on the neck, which makes her laugh.

<b>				FRED
</b>		It's nice to know I can still make you
		laugh.

<b>				RENEE
</b>		I like to laugh, Fred.

<b>				FRED
</b>		That's why I married you.

<b>				RENEE
</b>		Wake me up when you get home.

Fred brushes her cheek with his fingers, allowing them to 
linger for a moment on her face.

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>


<b>EXT.  CITY STREET - NIGHT
</b>
A blue neon sign reads: LUNA LOUNGE.

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  LUNA LOUNGE - NIGHT
</b>
Fred is on the bandstand.  He takes a solo on his saxophone.  
Fred plays hot, hard, neo-bop.  The BAND wails madly behind 
him.  The PATRONS explode onto the dance floor, making it a 
wild scene.  Fred Is a lion now, roaring away on his tenor, 
driving everyone nuts.

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  LUNA LOUNGE - LATER
</b>
After the band quits to take a break, FEMALE FANS come onto 
Fred, but he moves away, refusing their attentions.

<b>INT.  LUNA LOUNGE - BACKSTAGE - LATER

Fred dials a pay phone. 

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>
INT. The MADISON HOUSE - NIGHT

We move through the empty living room - empty bedroom, etc.  
The ringing telephone goes unanswered.

<b>CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. LUNA LOUNGE - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
</b>

LOSE UP 0N FPED'S FACE as he listens to the ringing.  
Sweat is still rolling off his face.  His eyes are blank.

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. THE MADISON HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
Fred's car pulls up in the driveway in front of his house.
Fred gets out, and goes into the house carrying his music
case.

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>

<b>INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
Fred puts down his music case, goes to the bedroom, and sees 
Renee sleeping soundly.

<b>								FADE OUT:
</b>
<b>								 FADE IN:
</b>
<b>EXT. THE MADISON HOUSE - DOORSTEPS - DAY
</b>
Renee in a bathrobe, opens the front door to collect the 
mail.  She sees a plain, clean, manila envelope lying on the 
step.  She picks it up.

CLOSE UP ON THE ENVELOPE - No stamp, no writing, blank.  She 
takes the mail from the box, and goes back into the house.

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>
Renee opens the manila envelope. She's noticeably nervous 
when she sees a videotape inside.  She stares at it.

Fred enters, also wearing a bathrobe.  He sees Renee staring 
at the videotape - before she hears him enter.  When she does 
hear him, her eyes jerk away from the tape.

<b>				FRED
</b>		What's that?

<b>				RENEE
</b>		A videotape.

<b>				FRED
</b>		Who's it from?

<b>				RENEE
</b>		I don't know... There's no return address 
		on the envelope... In fact, there's no 
		address on it.

<b>				FRED
</b>		Does it say anything on the tape?

<b>				RENEE
</b>			(looking it over)
		No, nothing.

Fred walks over and picks up the tape.

<b>				FRED
</b>		Well, let's see what's on it.

Fred takes the tape to the VCR.  He inserts it into the
machine, and turns it on.  Fred goes toward the couch.

<b>				FRED (CON'T)
</b>			(to Renee)
		Come on.

They sit on the couch in front of the television.

The TV monitor: We begin on the TV, then the videotape fills 
the entire frame.  The videotape shows the front of THE 
MADISON HOUSE, the camera panning slowly over it.  The 
picture is accompanied by an eerie DRONING SOUND.  After the 
camera pans back to the front door, the tape image turns to snow.

Fred and Renee stare at the snow for a few moments.  Renee 
looks relieved.

<b>				RENEE
</b>		It must be from a real estate agent.

<b>				FRED
</b>		Maybe.

We see a WIDE SHOT encompassing Fred, Renee, and the snowy 
image on the TV.

<b>								FADE OUT:
</b>
<b>								 FADE IN:
</b>
<b>INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY
</b>
Renee is seated at the dining room table - coffee cup and 
grapefruit in front of her.  She is wearing glasses, reading 
a book.  Fred enters, and sees Renee, who does not look up or 
acknowledge him.  Fred goes into the kitchen, which is just 
off the dining room.  He comes back into the dining room with 
a cup of coffee, and sits down with it opposite Renee.  He 
lights up a cigarette, sips his coffee, and looks at her.

<b>				FRED
</b>		Good book, huh?

<b>				RENEE
</b>			(she looks up)
		Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.

<b>				FRED
</b>		Same one you were reading the other
		night?

<b>				RENEE
</b>		What night?

<b>				FRED
</b>		When you didn't come to the club.

<b>				RENEE
</b>		Oh. Oh, yeah.  No. This is a different
		one.

<b>				FRED
</b>		I called, you know.

<b>				RENEE
</b>		Called?  When?

<b>				FRED
</b>		From the club.  You didn't answer.

<b>				RENEE
</b>		I must have fallen asleep.  I was asleep
		when you got home, wasn't I?

<b>				FRED
</b>		You were asleep when I got home, yes.

Renee goes back to her book.  Fred sips his coffee and 
smokes.

<b>				RENEE
</b>			(without looking up)
		I told you you could wake me up if you
		wanted to.

Renee looks up at him now, takes off her glasses, and stares 
at him.

CLOSE UP OF FRED'S FACE - a disturbed expression.

Renee seems about to say something more, but stops, puts her 
glasses back on and resumes reading.

<b>								FADE OUT:
</b>
<b>								 FADE IN:
</b>

<b>INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Fred is in bed waiting for Renee.  He hears noises from the 
bathroom - bottles clinking, drawers opening and closing.  
Renee comes out wearing a robe, which she sheds just before 
getting into bed.  Naked under the covers, she switches out 
her bedside lamp.  The only light in the room comes from the 
outside, through the windows.  Fred moves closer to Renee, 
puts his lips to her cheek, a hand on her breast.  She does 
not respond.  Fred pulls Renee to him, and kisses her 
passionately.  Renee accedes to his demands, but does not 
participate willingly.  He makes love to her voraciously, but 
her lack of passion disturbs him.  Fred can't stop, however, 
and when he comes she acts consolingly, stroking him 
maternally while he calms down.  He climbs off of her and 
retreats to his side of the bed.

CLOSE UP ON FRED'S EYES - which express his horror and 
humiliation.

They lie there in the dark silence for a while.

Fred turns back toward Renee in the darkness.

<b>				FRED
</b>		I had a dream about you last night...

<b>				RENEE
</b>		Yeah?

<b>				FRED
</b>		You were in the house... calling my
		name... but I couldn't find you.

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
<b>FRED'S DREAM
</b>
Fred is walking slowly across the living room.

Fred's POV: moving - searching.

Fred stops and listens.

<b>				RENEE
</b>			(tentatively - distant and off
			screen)
		Fred?  Fred, where are you?

The camera turns slowly back toward the hallway, and as it 
drifts it RISES UP following along the hall and turning 
slowly into the bedroom.  Renee is lying below in the bed.


<b>				FRED V.0.
</b>		Then there you were... lying in bed... 
		but it wasn't you... It looked like 
		you... but it wasn't.

The camera suddenly dives violently at Renee - into a TIGHT 
CLOSE UP.  Her face registers TOTAL FEAR.

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  THE MADISON HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Fred is lying in bed with Renee, who is now backlit by her 
bedside lamp.  Fred looks at her shadowed face, but it's not 
Renee's face.  It's a face Fred has never seen before.  Fred 
quickly turns and switches on his bedside lamp, and looks 
quickly back at Renee, whose face is now her own.

<b>				RENEE
</b>		Fred, are you all right?

Fred reaches out a hand and tenderly touches her face.  Renee 
covers his hand with her own, and closes her eyes.

<b>								FADE OUT:
</b>
<b>								 FADE IN:
</b>
<b>EXT. THE MADISON HOUSE - DAY
</b>
Renee finds another envelope on the doorstep.  She opens it, 
pulls out a videotape.  A large dog is BARKING incessantly 
somewhere in the neighborhood.  Renee looks around to see if 
she can see the dog.

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. THE MADIS0N HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>
Renee brings the videotape upstairs with the rest of the 
mail.  She is a bit puzzled and unsettled.  She puts the tape 
down on a table.  She stares at it.  Fred comes in.

<b>				FRED
</b>		You're up early.

<b>				RENEE
</b>		That dog woke me.  I lay there for a
		while, then decided to get up.

<b>				FRED
</b>		Who the hell owns that dog?

Fred notices the tape and manila envelope on the table.

<b>				FRED
</b>		What's that?  Another tape?

<b>				RENEE
</b>		Yes, I just found it on the step.

Fred picks it up.
<b>	
</b><b>				FRED
</b>		Don't you want to watch it?

<b>				RENEE
</b>		I guess so.

Fred goes to the VCR and inserts the tape.  He turns the 
television on.  He is about to start the tape - he looks up 
for Renee.  She's hanging back.

<b>				FRED
</b>		Well, do you wanna watch it?

Again, Renee seems to be nervous about what could be on the 
tape, but she hides this from Fred and walks toward the 
couch.

<b>				RENEE
</b>		Yeah.

Renee sits on the couch.  Fred starts the VCR and joins her.

As before, we first see it on the TV, then the videotape 
fills the frame.  This tape shows the front of the house, as 
before, then shows the INTERIOR of Fred and Renee's house -
<b>AT NIGHT.
</b>
The eerie DRONING SOUND goes throughout.

The camera glides at a very high angle near the ceilings 
looking down as it travels along a hallway and turns into 
their bedroom, where we see Fred and Renee sleeping.  The 
tape image then goes to snow.

Fred and Renee stare at the snowy TV picture.  After a few 
moments of silence, Renee gets up and switches off the set.  
She is visibly shaken, trembling.  She stares fearfully at 
Fred who seems less disturbed.

<b>				RENEE
</b>		We've got to call the police.

<b>				FRED
</b>		All right.

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>
Renee is on the telephone.  Fred is pacing, smoking, behind 
her.

<b>				RENEE
</b>		...yes, I've been on hold for ten
		minutes... I can't... All right, thanks.

Renee looks around anxiously.  Fred gives her his cigarette, 
which she puffs on.  He lights another and continues pacing.

<b>				RENEE
</b>		Hello, yes... Good... My name is Renee
		Madison... My husband is Fred Madison,
		the jazz musician... we	live at 442
		Hollis Street... Right... 442 Hollis...
		near the observatory... Someone's been in
		the house... at night... while we were
		sleeping... I know because they sent, 
		dropped off a videotape... two 
		videotapes... to show us... That's 
		right... Yes... it... the second one... 
		shows us asleep... Someone broke in and 
		taped us while we slept!... Isn't that 
		enough?... Okay, sure... We will... 442 
		Hollis... Yes, we'll be here.

Renee hangs up.

<b>				FRED 
</b>		So?

<b>				RENEE
</b>		Two detectives are coming out.

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>
Two men in suits - the Detectives, ED and AL, are seated on 
the couch, watching the last part of the second videotape.  
The screen goes to snow and stays that way for several 
moments, until Fred shuts it off.


<b>				FRED
</b>		That's it.

<b>				ED
</b>		Let's have a look at the hallway outside
		the bedroom.

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
All four of them go to the hallway, where Ed and Al look 
around, especially up toward the ceiling.

<b>				AL
</b>		Very strange.

<b>				RENEE
</b>		What is?

<b>				AL
</b>		The angle.  The high angle shot on the
		tape.

<b>				ED

<b>				FRED
</b>		This is our bedroom.

</b>		There's no other bedroom?

<b>				FRED
</b>		No... There is, I mean, I use it as a

</b>		No. Fred hates them.

The Detectives both look at Fred.

<b>				FRED
</b>		I like to remember things my own way.

<b>				AL
</b>		What do you mean by that?

<b>				FRED
</b>		How I remember them.  Not necessarily the
		way they happened.

<b>				ED
</b>		Do you have an alarm system?

<b>				RENEE
</b>		Yes, actually we do... but we haven't
		been using it.

<b>				AL
</b>		Why not?

<b>				FRED
</b>		It kept going off for some reason.  False

Fred is standing in the living room looking in the direction 
of the stairwell.  We HEAR someone's steps coming up the 
stairs.  It's Renee, who eventually comes into view.  She is 
holding another manila envelope.  She arrives at the top 
step.

She and Fred lock eyes.

Fred takes the envelope, opens it, and pulls out a third 
videotape. without saying anything, Fred takes the tape to 
the VCR.  He inserts it very carefully, slowly.  He hits 
play, turns on the television and he and Renee sit down on 
the couch together and begin to watch with great 
apprehension.

Again we begin with a WIDE SHOT and then the TV monitor fills 
the screen: We see the interior of the house at night.  The 
camera glides looking down from a high angle along the 
hallway and into the bedroom, where Fred and Renee are 
sleeping.

Again, the DRONING SOUND plays throughout.

in the bedroom where Fred and Renee are seen sleeping, 
SUDDENLY, Fred, on the tape, slowly awakens as the camera 
holds on him.  He rises and turns unnaturally in the bed, as 
if drawn up by his awareness of some strange presence in the 
room.  He comes to a sitting position, his head straining 
upwards, looking in the direction of the camera.  At this 
point, the videotape image turns to snow.

Fred and Renee are on the couch.  The TV remains on, showing 
snow.

Renee is very upset, crying.

<b>				RENEE
</b>		What the hell is going on?!

<b>				FRED
</b>			(equally horrified -
			frightened)
		I wish I knew.

Fred reaches over and tentatively takes Renee's hand in his.  
She trembles, allows him to touch her, but otherwise does not 
respond.  Suddenly, she jumps with fright.

<b>				RENEE
</b>		What was that?!!!

<b>				FRED
</b>		What?

<b>				RENEE
</b>		On the tape!  There was something else on
		the tape.

Fred gets up and rewinds it, passing an image.

<b>				RENEE (CON'T)
</b>		There!  Play it!

Fred runs the tape forward.

We see snow - then a half-second long MEDIUM SHOT of Fred on 
his knees near the bedroom wall on Renee's side of the bed.  
He is looking directly at the camera - his face a ghastly 
grimace, contorted.  His eyes are WIDE WITH HORROR.

Fred runs it back again and FREEZES the tape there on his 
tormented image.  This image fills the screen.  He and Renee 
stare at it.

The Detectives, with Fred and Renee are seated on chairs and 
the couch.  The three videotapes in their manila envelopes 
are stacked on a coffee table in the center.

<b>				AL
</b>		You don't remember being awakened?  It

<b>				ED
</b>		Or something.

<b>				FRED
</b>		No, I don't remember anything. it looks
		like I... but... I don't remember.

<b>				RENEE
</b>		Why would anyone do something like this?

<b>				AL
</b>		Has anyone made any threats to either of
		you recently?

<b>				ED
</b>		Or not so recently?

<b>				FRED
</b>		No, not to me.

Al, Ed and Fred all look at Renee.

<b>				RENEE
</b>		I...	no. No. No threats.

<b>				ED
</b>		We'll take the tapes with us, if that's
		all right with you?

Ed looks at Fred, then Renee, both of whom nod their 
agreement.

<b>				AL
</b>		We'll see that the patrol of the house is
		doubled.

<b>				RENEE
</b>		I don't know if I want to stay here.  I
		don't feel safe.

<b>				FRED
</b>		Where would you feel safe?

<b>				RENEE
</b>		I don't know. maybe a hotel.

Ed and Al are watching this exchange between Fred and Renee 
with keen interest.

There is a strained silence between them.

<b>				ED
</b>		Did you use the alarm system since we
		were here last?

<b>				FRED
</b>		The first night ... Not the last two.

<b>				AL
</b>		Why not?

<b>				FRED
</b>			(shrugs)
		I forgot.  Anyway, I hate the idea of
		acting paranoid.

<b>				RENEE
</b>		Acting paranoid?!!! Someone is in our 
		house while we're sleeping, filming us, 
		and you don't want to act paranoid?!!! I 
		thought you set the alarm!

Fred gets up, lights a cigarette, paces.

<b>				FRED
</b>		I'll make sure the alarm is set from now
		on.

<b>				RENEE
</b>		But that doesn't solve the problem.  Who
		is doing this?  And why?

Ed and Al rise from their chairs.  Ed picks up the envelopes.

Renee stands with the Detectives.  Fred stands apart - his 
expression, pained and bewildered.

<b>INT. ANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
A swinging party is in progress at Andy's house - the man
whose face we saw at the Luna Lounge with Renee.  ANDY, 37 
years old, a slick guy, is seen moving through the crowd, 
making small talk, kissing and being kissed.  The PEOPLE here 
are wannabe players, the men mostly shady, gold-chain-
wearing, slightly unsavory types; the women dressed 
provocatively, big hair and skin-tight dresses.  Through 
sliding glass doors we see nude and semi-nude people 
cavorting in a swimming pool.  Everyone has a drink in his or 
her hand.  Renee finishes her drinkt and hands the empty
glass to Fred who walks away with it.  Andy grabs Renee, and 
dances with her.  They laugh and talk.  Renee appears to be a 
bit intoxicated.

Fred, who appears less than thrilled with the carryings on, 
makes his way to the open bar where he orders two drinks. 
When the drinks arrive he drains one of them completely, then 
sets the empty glass down on the bar.  Then he swallows the 
other drink, too, and sets down the glass.

A MYSTERY MAN, tall, well-dressed and groomed, older than 
Fred, approaches him.

<b>				MYSTERY MAN
</b>		We've met before, haven't we?

<b>				FRED
</b>		I don't think so.  Where was it that you
		think we've met?

<b>				MYSTERY MAN
</b>		At your house.  Don't you remember?

<b>				FRED
</b>			(surprised)
		No, no I don't.  Are you sure?

<b>				MYSTERY MAN
</b>		Of course.  In fact, I'm there right now.

<b>				FRED
</b>			(incredulous)
		What do you mean?  You're where right
		now?

<b>				MYSTERY MAN
</b>		At your house.

<b>				FRED
</b>		That's absurd.

The Mystery Man reaches into his coat pocket, takes out a 
cellular phone and holds it out to Fred.

<b>				MYSTERY MAN
</b>		Call me.

Fred snickers, like this is a bad joke.  The Mystery Man puts 
the phone into Fred's hand.

<b>				MYSTERY MAN
</b><b>				(CON-T)
</b>		Dial your number.

Fred hesitates, puzzled.

<b>				MYSTERY MAN
</b><b>				(CON-T)
</b>		Go ahead.

Fred shrugs, laughs, dials his number. We HEAR a pick up as 
we stay on FRED'S FACE.

<b>				PHONE VOICE OF 
</b><b>				MYSTERY MAN
</b>		I told you I was here.

Fred, still holding the phone, stares at the man standing in 
front of him.

<b>				FRED
</b>		How did you do that?

The Mystery Man points to the phone.

<b>				MYSTERY MAN
</b>				Ask me.

Fred, mirthful at first, as if it is a party trick of some 
kind, suddenly turns serious - it's obvious he's thinking now 
of the videotapes.  He speaks into the phone.

<b>				FRED
</b>			(angrily)
		How did you get into my house?

<b>				PHONE VOICE OF
</b><b>				MYSTERY MAN
</b>		You invited me.  It's not my habit to go
		where I'm not wanted.

Fred looks at the man in front of him, but speaks again into 
the phone.

<b>				FRED
</b>		Who are you?

The man laughs - identical laughs - both over the phone and in person.

<b>				PHONE VOICE OF
</b><b>				MYSTERY MAN
</b>		Give me my phone back.

The man in front of Fred reaches out his hand for the phone.  
Fred hears the line go dead, and he slowly passes the phone 
back to the Mystery Man who takes it, folds it, and puts it in his pocket.

<b>				MYSTERY MAN
</b>		It's been a pleasure talking to you.

The man walks away from Fred.  Renee appears and comes up to Fred.

<b>				RENEE
</b>		I thought you were getting me a drink?

<b>				FRED
</b>		Just a minute.

He takes Renee by the arm and goes over to the host of the 
party, Andy.  He grabs Andy and points across the room toward 
the Mystery Man, who is engaged in conversation with OTHER 
<b>GUESTS.
</b>
<b>				FRED
</b>		Andy, who is that guy?

<b>				ANDY
</b>			(looking at the Mystery Man)
		I don't know his name.  He's a friend of
		Dick Laurent's, I think.

<b>				FRED
</b>		Dick Laurent?

<b>				ANDY
</b>		Yes, I believe so.

<b>				FRED
</b>			(remembering something)
		But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?

<b>				ANDY
</b>		He is?  I didn't think you knew Dick.
		How do you know he's dead?

Andy and Renee exchange a worried look, which Fred does not notice.

<b>				FRED
</b>		I don't.  I don't know him.

<b>				ANDY
</b>			(angrily)
		Dick can't be dead.  Who told you he was
		dead?

<b>				RENEE
</b>		Honey, who?... Who's dead?

Fred takes Renee by the arm away from Andy.

<b>				FRED
</b>		Let's go home.

<b>				RENEE
</b>		But...

<b>				FRED
</b>		Now!  We're leaving now! I didn't want
		to come here in the first place.

Fred drags the reluctant Renee out of Andy's house.

the top of the stairway.  He comes up into the living room 
carrying a manila envelope, like the ones previously 
received.  His expression is strained.  He is alone.  Fred 
pulls a videotape out of the envelope and inserts it in the 
VCR, turns it on.  He sits on the couch and watches.  We go 
from a WIDE SHOT to a FULL FRAME SHOT of the video.

On the tape is the same nighttime interior of the house, 
accompanied by the DRONING SOUND.  The camera moves eerily 
down the hall toward the bedroom, sliding at a high angle.  
The camera turns slowly into the bedroom - looking down.

BLOOD is splattered over the floor, bed, walls.  The camera 
drifts.  THE DEAD BODY OF RENEE lies on the floor at the foot
of the bed.  She is badly mutilated.  Fred is hovering over 
her on the tape, ON HIS KNEES, A HORRIFIED, UNBELIEVING 
EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE.  On the tape, Fred turns away from 
Renee - his hands raised, dripping blood - her blood.  His 
movements are almost mechanical, constricted, as he strains 
strangely upwards seemingly against his will, as if feeling 
some enormous pressure.  He looks directly at the camera, his 
face a ghastly grimace, contorted, just before the taped 
image goes to snow.

Attendant prepares for the impending autopsy, laying out a 
rack of instruments, positioning the corpse.  As he is doing 
these things, the MEDICAL EXAMINER enters, accompanied by his 
GIRLFRIEND.  The M.E. is dressed formally, in a tuxedo.  The 
young woman is wearing a slinky dress with a fur wrap, 
pearls, spike heels.  The couple are close; she has an arm 
through his, and she laughs, nervously.  He is smoking a 
cigarette.

		Just like Christmas.

He begins to unwrap them.

smoldering there among hair and flesh gristle on the drain's 
filter screen.

around the drain.  She is stepping nervously, like a spooked 
horse.  The clatter of her heels is very loud.  We hear the

<b>				FOREMAN
</b>		Yes, we have, your honor.

<b>				MARIAN
</b>		The heart, I guess.

<b>				RAQUEL
</b>		I wouldn't... The brain would know what's

		open trying to pump blood, blood pouring

		Marian.

Raquel takes a red teddy and holds it up to her chest.

<b>				MARIAN
</b>		Oh, that's hot... So you'd rather be

They both giggle at the obvious joke.

Marian reaches for a pair of panties with a hole in the crotch.

Marian sticks a finger through the hole in the panties and 
wiggles it.  The girls giggle.  Raquel sees Andy walking into

<b>INT. PRISON - EXERCISE YARD - DAY
</b>
This is a small narrow yard, not the large exercise yard for 
population.  This yard is for use by death row prisoners 
only, to exercise in one hour each day, by himself.  Fred is 
released into the area, which is more like a dog run.  The 
Guards watch Fred as he walks slowly up and down the exercise 
yard.

There is more activity on the row tonight than usual.  A

There is a building murmur among the prisoners.

TWO GUARDS are standing at the guard station.

<b>				GUARD #1
</b>			(very quietly - solemnly)
		Here he comes.

Several of the men in suits, along with several GUARDS, and a 
CLERGYMAN, a PRISONER in the middle of the group, enter the 
hallway.  They proceed past the guard station down the hall.  
As the procession files by, DEATH ROW INMATES come to their 
doors and talk to the prisoner.

<b>				INMATE #1
</b>		See you soon, Sammy.  Don't think takin' 
		a jolt is gonna get you outta payin' me 
		back the twenty you owe me.

<b>				INMATE #2
</b>		Don't take it personal, pal.

<b>				INMATE #3
</b>		Un fuerte abrazo, amigo!

As the men march down the hallway, they pass Fred's cell.  
His window panel is empty.  The camera stops on Fred's cell 
door, as we HEAR other prisoners talking to the inmate on his 
way to the ELECTRIC CHAIR.

<b>				INMATE #4
</b>		Hang in there, honey.

<b>				INMATE #5
</b>		Keep an eye out for me, Sammy G.

<b>INT. PRISON - DEATH CHAMBER - NIGHT
</b>
The prisoner is strapped into the electric chair.  Behind a 
glass partition WITNESSES are seated. One of the men in 
suits, the WARDEN, goes to a telephone on the wall and stands 
with his hand on the receiver.  He picks it up.

<b>				WARDEN
</b>			(into phone)
		Line check.
			(pause)
		Okay.

The Warden hangs up the telephone and stays next to it.

We see one of the condemned man's WRISTS being clamped with 
an electrical device.  The other wrist is clamped.

A metal halo is placed around the condemned man's head.  A 
large electrical cable leads off from the halo.

Electrically conductive ointment is smeared around the areas 
where the clamps have been placed.

The Clergyman moves close to the condemned man continuing to 
give the man his last rites.  When he is finished, he nods to 
the Warden.  The Warden approaches the condemned man.

<b>				WARDEN
</b>		Any final words, Sam?

The condemned man shakes his head "no".

The Warden and the others clear the room and the doors are 
locked.

The EXECUTIONER steps into place near a huge lever.  He looks 
to the Warden.

The Witnesses sit in silent anticipation.

The hands of the clock on the wall have moved past midnight.

The Warden takes one last look through a window at the 
condemned man - then nods to the Executioner.

Fred sits frozen at the edge on his bed.

A distant but LOUD ELECTRICAL HUM begins.

Fred's head jerks upward to the light on his ceiling.  It has 
dimmed to almost nothing.

Fred sits in the humming darkness.

The Guards release Fred into the yard for his exercise.  At 
first the sunlight is blinding, and Fred covers his eyes.  He 
moves along the wall, tentative, his fingers feeling the way.  
Fnally he slumps down on his haunches, back leaned 
against the wall, eyes closed, letting the sun hit his face.  Very 
soon, however, the sun passes behind a cloud and Fred is 
bathed in shade.  Fred stands up, but is almost immediately 
hit by a searing pain in his head.  Fred holds his head with 
his hands, sinks down to his knees.  The Guard, who has been 
observing Fred from the doorway, comes over to him.

<b>				GUARD
</b>		Something wrong?

<b>				FRED
</b>		My... My head.

<b>				GUARD
</b>		Headache, huh?  Too much sun, I guess.  
		You want to come in?  Still got forty-
		five minutes outside if you want it.

<b>				FRED
</b>		No, no.  I want to go in.

The guard assists Fred back inside the building.

Fred is on his cot, holding his head.  He is obviously in 
pain.  He gets up and staggers to the cell door.  Fred pushes 
a CALL button next to the door to summon a guard.  The GUARD 
comes and speaks to Fred through a double mesh opening.

<b>				GUARD
</b>		What's botbering you, Madison?

<b>				FRED
</b>		The pain is getting worse.  I need more
		aspirin.

<b>				GUARD
</b>		I can't give you anymore.  I'll talk to

The guard leaves. Fred collapses to the floor of the cell,
writhing in pain.

Fred is brought in wearing handcuffs and leg irons, a GUARD 
on either arm.  He is placed on a chair in the middle of the 
room.  The guards stand one on each side of him.  A DOCTOR 
enters.  He is in late-middle age, with serious eyebrows.  
Fred's head is hanging down, chin on chest.  The Doctor lifts 
Fred's head and we see dark circles under Fred's eyes; his 
face is pale, teeth clenched, eyes tearing.  The Doctor takes 
a light utensil from his pocket, and inspects each of Fred's 
eyes.  He feels Fred's forehead.  After this, he allows 
Fred's head to drop down again.  The Doctor takes Fred's 
pulse.  He drops Fred's wrist.  He next takes Fred's blood 
pressure.

<b>				DOCTOR
</b>		You sleeping okay?

<b>				FRED
</b>			(strained whisper)
		I can't sleep.

The Doctor goes over to a cabinet, unlocks a drawer, and 
removes a large blue pill.  He fills a paper cup with water 
from a dispenser, goes back to Fred and places the pill in 
Fred's mouth.  The Doctor tilts Fred's head up and pours the 
water down his throat, some of it dribbling down the front of 
Fred's shirt.  The Doctor looks into Fred's mouth to make 
sure he swallowed the pill.

<b>				DOCTOR
</b>		You'll sleep now.
			(to Guards)
		Take him back to his cell.

The guards lift Fred by his arms, and shuffle march him out 
of the infirmary.

Fred awakens on his cot.  He turns and sits up in the 
darkness.  A stream of light through the slot window 
illumines Fred's head, the forehead of which is swollen and 
discolored.  He staggers up and shuffles over to the call 
button, which he leans on.  A few moments later, a GUARD 
appears on the other side of the mesh.

<b>				GUARD
</b>		What is it?

<b>				FRED
</b>		Aspirin... fly head.  I gotta have more
		aspirin.

<b>				GUARD
</b>		The doctor said not to give you anything.
		You can see him in the morning.

<b>				FRED

The guard looks at Fred through the window, and what he sees 
disturbs him.  The guard makes a strange face.

Fred is on the floor lying on back. The camera comes 
slowly down at him from the ceiling, like a weight pressing 
on his head.  Fred's pain is demonstrably overwhelming him 
now.  He moans and rolls from side to side in the dimness, 
making grotesque, otherworldly sounds.  As the camera moves 
into a CLOSE UP, the last image of Fred's head shows the 
discolored swelling has increased.  Fred looks up, sensing 
something.

Marian and Raquel are in the living room, attired in the 
undergarments they purchased at the lingerie store.  HOT 
MUSIC is BLARING from a stereo.  Marian and Raquel are 
dancing, as sexy and wild as it is possible for them to be.  
Andy is lying on his back on the rug, dressed only in 
undershorts and socks, the girls stomping feet stepping 
furiously around his head and body.  His eyes are closed at 
first, but when he opens them, he sees their feet in a blur.  
He tries to get up, but he is too strung out, and he 
collapses again.  Marian and Raquel take him by his hands and
feet and begin pulling him around the room as they dance.  
Andy is blitzed, smiling moronically.  The girls' breasts 
tumble out of their teddies.  Raquel drops her end of Andy, 
turns up the music even louder, and dances into a frenzy.  
Marian drops to her knees, Andy's feet on either side of her, 
shaking her shoulders and whipping her hair around.  Andy 
makes another attempt to sit up - he looks at Marian, reaches 
for her but falls back, dead to the world.  Raquel and Marian 
don't quit.

Fred is still curled on the floor, but spasms begin to rock 
his body.  He goes into convulsions, blood gushes from his 
nostrils.  His head is badly swollen.  Fred vomits repeatedly, 
and drags around in his mess.  Fred turns, straining upwards 
as we've seen him do before.  His face and head are hideously 
deformed.

Fred brings his shaking, tortured hand to his forehead.  He 
pulls his hand down across his face squeezing it as it goes.  
As his hand passes over his face, Fred's features are removed 
leaving a blank, white mass with eye sockets.

We move into the eye sockets and beyond.

unsettled, as he looks directly at us as we move closer to 
him.  The ghost image of a house appears behind Pete.  There 
is a girl, SHEILA, standing on the lawn in front of the 
house.  She is afraid and is trying to communicate with Pete.  
Pete doesn't seem to hear her and continues to stare directly

about to make a check-mark, but looks in again and appears 
confused.  THE MAN INSIDE IS NOT FRED.

GUARDS are standing by the door and at strategic spots in the
room.

<b>				WARDEN

<b>				DR. ROGOFF
</b>		I don't know yet.

Dr. Rogoff begins to draw blood from the man's arm. He takes
several vials.  The man watches the blood coming out of his
arm, but doesn't seem to understand where he is or what is 
happening to him.

Dr. Rogoff stands up, puts the light in his breast pocket.

Daytons are a middle-aged, San Fernando Valley couple.  Bill 
Dayton is wearing a sport shirt with the short-sleeves rolled 
up. His skin is leathery, tanned and his thinning hair is 
slicked back in a duck-tail.  He's working-class, ex-biker.  
Claire Dayton was obviously a good looking "chick" who's gone

Bill and Claire look at each other - bewildered.

<b>				WARDEN
</b>		Yes.

<b>				CLAIRE

The warden shakes his head.

Bill and Claire look at each other again - briefly.

<b>				BILL
</b>		His condition?  What do you mean?

<b>				WARDEN
</b>		His physical condition.

<b>				BILL

		Same as always.  Pete takes care of

Bill and Claire look at each other once again.

<b>				CLAIRE
</b>		I saw him before he went to the garage 
		day before yesterday.  He's a mechanic. 
		Look, is he okay?  Can we see him?

The Warden looks at Dr. Rogoff.

<b>				DR. ROGOFF
</b>		He has a hematoma on his forehead and a 
		condition called blepharitis... that's 
		redness and swelling around the eyes.

<b>				BILL
</b>		Was he in a fight?

<b>				DR. ROGOFF
</b>		These conditions don't indicate a fight.

<b>				CLAIRE
</b>		But what is the cause then? ... And how
		did he get in that cell?

<b>				DR. ROGOFF
</b>		He can't talk.  Or won't.

<b>				BILL
</b>		That doesn't sound like Pete.

<b>				DR. ROGOFF
</b>		Your son has experienced some sort of 
		trauma, I'm afraid.  We were hoping that 
		the two of you could help explain the 
		cause of the trauma and how he came to be 
		here.

<b>				CAPTAIN HENDERSON
</b>		You don't know Fred Madison?

<b>				BILL
</b>		No... Only what was in the news.

<b>				CAPTAIN HENDERSON
</b>		Do you think Pete knows him?

<b>				CLAIRE
</b>		I wouldn't know how.

<b>				WARDEN

<b>				CLAIRE
</b>		When he went to work, right.

<b>				WARDEN
</b>		Yes, and we need to talk to him... if we
		can.

		Mel, let's get Peter in here.

Dr. Rogoff leaves the room.  While he's gone, nobody talks, 
increasing the tension.  Dr. Rogoff returns with Pete Dayton, 
dressed in his own clothes: jeans, boots, sport shirt.  
Pete's forehead is lumpy and his eyes are red and swollen.  
He can walk, but unsteadily.

Pete looks around the room - sees his parents.

Claire jumps up.

<b>				CLAIRE

		Pete...

She and Dr. Rogoff help get Pete settled in a chair.  Bill is 
taken aback at the sight of his son, but says nothing.

<b>				WARDEN (CON'T)
</b>		Pete, can you tell us now, anything about
		this?

<b>				CLAIRE
</b>		Pete, what happened to you?

Pete has a dazed look on his face.  He starts to speak, then 
stops.

<b>				CLAIRE (CON'T)
</b>		It's okay.  Take your time, honey.

Pete's gaze drifts from his mother's face around the room and 
back to her face.

<b>				PETE

		Where ... am I?

The Warden and Captain Henderson look to Dr. Rogoff.

<b>				DR. ROGOFF
</b>		You're in the state penitentiary.  You

Pete rubs his head like it's about to explode with pain.

<b>				WARDEN

		and not him.

<b>				PETE
</b>		I... I don't know.

<b>				CAPTAIN HENDERSON
</b>		Do you know Fred Madison?

<b>				PETE

		No.

There is a silence in the room, as Pete massages his 
throbbing temples.

<b>				CLAIRE
</b>			(worried)
		Warden, can we take him home?

The Warden looks at Dr. Rogoff.

<b>				DR. ROGOFF
</b>			(to Warden)
		From a medical standpoint, I don't see
		why not.

<b>				CAPTAIN HENDERSON
</b>		We need to find out what happened here.

<b>				BILL
</b>			(standing up)
		Have you made any charges against him?

<b>				WARDEN
</b>		No.

<b>				WARDEN
</b>		All right... but you see our 
		predicament... Legally we can't hold 
		him, but he may be able to help us... 
		perhaps later.  For now, he's free to

Bill and Claire help Pete up and carefully escort him out of 
the warden's office. With a nod from the Warden, the guard 
accompanies them out of the room.  The Warden, Captain 
Henderson and Dr. Rogoff stand but remain in the office.

Bill and Claire take Pete to his room, which has a bed, desk, 
two chairs and a sea of disassembled motorcycle parts 
belonging to a classic Indian motorbike which Pete is 
rebuilding.  Each part is shiny and clean.

Pete sits down on his bed and looks up at his parents -
shaking his head with confusion and embarrassment.

<b>				BILL
</b>		Just rest easy, Pete. You're gonna be
		okay.

<b>				CLAIRE
</b>		Are you hungry, honey?  I'll fix you
		something.

<b>				PETE
</b>		No... I don't feel so good.  I would

Pete sleeps.

In the living room, Bill is drinking a beer and watching 
television.

In the kitchen, Claire is finishing the dishes.  She goes 
into the living room and leans down and whispers something in 
Bill's ear.  Bill nods and Claire walks quietly down the 
hallway and opens Pete's door.

She looks in on him sleeping.

An unmarked police car pulls up across the street from the 
Dayton house.  In the front seat are the Detectives, Ed and 
Al. Al, who is on the passenger side, is holding two 
styrofoam cups filled with coffee.  Ed removes from his 
inside jacket pocket a 5" x 7" photo of Pete Dayton, which he 
props up on the dashboard so that it is visible for both 
himself and Al.  Al hands one of the cups to Ed.

<b>				ED
</b>		Thanks, Al.

Al studies Pete Dayton's face in the photo.

<b>				AL
</b>		Now we'll see what this son of a bitch is
		up to.

</b>		Yeah.


Ed and Al sip their coffee and stare at the house.

Pete slowly moves up to a sitting position, then stands.  He 
stretches and walks around the yard feeling the dry, 
unwatered lawn on his bare feet.

He walks over and leans over the neighbor's fence.  His eyes 
fall on a plastic toy boat floating in b child's plastic
swimming pool.  He watches the boat as the warm breeze blows 
it lazily in a circle.

A small plane drones overhead.

In the distance, a WOMAN finishes hanging out some wash and 
goes in the back door of her house.  The slamming of her 
screen door sounds a thousand miles away.

Pete continues to observe these seemingly peaceful 
surroundings - but something doesn't feel right to him.

Pete is eating a sandwich - he is looking much better.
Claire opens a bag of chips and sets them in front of Pete as 
Bill comes in the front door.

Bill comes in and pops a beer - looks around.

<b>				BILL
</b>		Where's Pete?

<b>				CLAIRE
</b>		Out in back.

<b>				BILL
</b>		You talk to him?

<b>				CLAIRE
</b>			(urgent)
		No... Here he comes.

Their gazes follow a path from the backyard into where Pete 
has been sitting all the time.

<b>				BILL
</b>		How're you feelin'?

Pete looks at his parents - he can't figure out what has just 
happened.

<b>				PETE
</b>			(unsure - brow furrowed)
		Better.

<b>				BILL
</b>		Arnie called this morning while you were

Bill and Claire just stare at him.  Pete shakes his head and 
takes another bite of his sandwich - but inside the worrisome 
feeling returns.

Pete is stretched out on his bed watching television.  He 
hears the front door bell ring - footsteps, and a moment or 
two later the door to his bedroom opens and three of his 
friends, CARL, LANIE and STEVE ("V") saunter in.

<b>				"V"
</b>		Where the fuck have you been?

Pete pulls himself up to a sitting position.

<b>				PETE
</b>		Hey.

<b>				CARL
</b>		You look like shit.

<b>				LANIE
</b>		What happened?

<b>				PETE
</b>		Just haven't been feelin' well.

</b>		Good... You up for a drive?

<b>				PETE
</b>		Where to?  Hey, Lanie, I heard you were
		out of it for a while, too.

<b>				LANIE
</b>		They found a cyst on my god damn ovary.  
		Had to cut it out.  You wanna see the 
		scar?

Lanie pulls up her shirt and pulls down her pants a ways
revealing a fresh scar about three inches long.

<b>				CARL
</b>			(winking)
		Hadn't slowed her down none.

<b>				LANIE
</b>			(smacking him)
		Shut up, bone-head.

Then Lanie laughs good-naturedly.

<b>				"V"
</b>		Just goin' up'ta "Tops"... Maybe the "Ten

<b>				PETE
</b>		Sheila'll be at "Tops".

<b>				"V"
</b>		Sure, what's wrong with that?

<b>				PETE
</b>		Okay.

Pete hauls himself up off the bed and throws on a black
leather jacket.

The four of them go through the living room where Bill and 
Claire are drinking and watching TV.

<b>				PETE

		Goin' out with these clowns for a while.

"V" drives a black, beat-up '66 Grand Prix.  Carl and Lanie 
are in the back seat, and Pete rides shotgun.  The four of 
them., are cruising down Van Nuys Boulevard along with many 
other MUSCLE CARS and LOW-RIDERS filled with KIDS looking for
action. "V's" car is making a hell of a noise.

<b>				PETE
</b>		I hate ridin' in this fuckin' car.

<b>				CARL
</b>		Take it easy, Pete, "V" loves this rod.

<b>				"V"
</b>		Look at that goin' my way.

"V" has seen a couple. of GIRLS in short, tight dresses 
walking up the boulevard.

<b>				"V" (CON'T)
</b>		Oh my, oh my.

<b>				LANIE
</b>		Keep it in your pants, "V".

Some big cars nearby rev their engines.  "V" guns his car and 
it lurches roughly forward.  The sound of the rough running 
engine reverberates in Pete's brain.

<b>				PETE
</b>		This rod is a fuckin, embarrassment,
		Carl.  Whatiya burn in this thing, "V"?

<b>				"V"
</b>		Texaco... What's wrong with that?

<b>				PETE
</b>		Listen.

<b>				"V"
</b>		You gotta be kiddin'... This is the 
		boulevard... You can't hear yourself 
		think.

Pete shakes his bead with disgust.

"V" pulls the car off the boulevard into "Tops" drive-in.  
Cars are lined up at the "to go" window and all along the 
side of the building where people are hanging out under a 
long metal awning.  MUSIC is playing LOUD.

"V" pulls into a parking spot by the awning.  The headlights 
illuminate a group of HIPSTERS - some dancing, some just 
hanging out.  THREE or FOUR GIRLS hanging out together turn 
toward "V's" car.  They see Pete in the front seat, and one 
of the girls, Sheila, smiles and walks toward him.

<b>				SHEILA
</b>		Hey.  Where have you been?

Pete talks to her through the open window while "V", Carl and 
Lanie climb out through "V's" door.  "V" leans back in.

<b>				"V"
</b>			(to Pete)
		You want somethin'?

<b>				PETE
</b>		No, I'm okay.

"V" walks off with the others to the "take out" window.
Sheila leans in closer to Pete.

<b>				SHEILA
</b>		I missed you.

<b>				PETE
</b>		Yeah?...

<b>				SHEILA
</b>		Yeah.

Sheila's girlfriends saunter over and lean on the car around 
her - looking in at Pete.

<b>				GIRL #1
</b>		What happened to your face?

<b>				PETE
</b>		Nothin'.

<b>				SHEILA
</b>		What are you guys doin'?

<b>				PETE
</b>		Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin".

<b>				SHEILA
</b>		You want some company?

"V", Carl and Lanie return with burgers and drinks.  "V's" 
got a mouthful of burger.

<b>				"V"

		What's happenin'?

<b>				PETE
</b>		They're comin' with us.

<b>				"V"

		Pile in.

Sheila and her girlfriends jump in the car with "V", Carl, 
Lanie and Pete.  "V" fires up the rough-running engine and 
pulls out - leaving behind a cloud of smoke.

The bowling alley is divided into a game room area, a bar/ 
restaurant area and a bowling area.

Pete and the group stroll into the bar and take a large 
booth.  MUSIC is playing LOUD.

A WAITRESS takes orders for drinks.

Bowling pins clatter loudly in the distance.

"V" takes one of Sheila's friends and dances with her.

Sheila takes Pete by the arm and pulls him up to dance.  The 
music is fast, but they dance slow.

<b>				SHEILA
</b>		Why haven't you called me?

<b>				PETE
</b>		Sorry... I...

Sheila looks around and moves closer to Pete.  She whispers 
urgently, worried.

<b>				SHEILA
</b>			(whispering)
		What's happening to you?  What happened
		to your face?

<b>				PETE
</b>		I don't know.

<b>				SHEILA

Pete laughs, but Sheila doesn't.

<b>				PETE
</b>		Who else could I be7

Sheila stares seriously at Pete, but then laughs too.

<b>				SHEILA
</b>		I don't know.

Sheila leans in very close to Pete and whispers in his ear.

<b>				SHEILA (CON'T)
</b>		You still care about me?

<b>				PETE
</b>		Sure.  Sure I do.

Sheila pushes her mouth on Pete's and they kiss., Pete breaks 
away - looks at Sheila - serious.

Pete pops up and gives Mr. Eddy the "thumbs up" and gets back 
into the car.

Mr. Eddy looks into his rearview mirror.

<b>				MR. EDDY
</b>		Oh, shit... Is that what I think it is?

Pete turns and looks back.  A car is TAILGATING them, the 
silver-gray Infiniti.  The two assistants in the backseat 
turn nonchalantly to take a look - then they return their 
look to Mr. Eddy.

Mr. Eddy starts to take a slow burn - keeps looking at the 
Infiniti in the rearview mirror.

The assistants look to one another take a deep breath.

Mr. Eddy slows slightly and then keeps the Pullman steady at 
32 m.p.h. The Infiniti moves up ten feet behind the Pullman, 
and blows its horn.

Mr. Eddy rolls down his window.

The assistants are paying close attention - they buckle their 
seatbelts.

Pete notices a tension in the car.  He watches Mr. Eddy's 
face.

Mr. Eddy pulls slightly to the right of the road, pastes a 
polite, courteous smile on his face, puts his left arm out 
the window and waves the Infiniti by.

The Infiniti jets forward and swerves around the Pullman.  
When the cars are side by side, the irate DRIVER in the 
Infiniti gives Mr. Eddy "the bird" and flies past.

CLOSE ON MR. EDDY'S RIGHT FOOT as it slams down on the gas 
pedal.

The Pullman catapults forward toward the Infiniti.

Pete is thrown back - he grabs on to the door handle and the 
seat for support.

The Pullman gains on the Infiniti in a flash.  The Infiniti 
tries to go faster, but Mr. Eddy's Pullman has much more 
power.

<b>				MR. EDDY
</b>			(clenched teeth)
		This is where power and mechanical
		excellence pays off.

Mr. Eddy jams the Pullman into the back of the Infiniti and 
pushes it faster and faster along Mulholland.  The Driver of 
the Infiniti tries to brake and blue-gray smoke streams out 
from beneath the Infiniti with a scream of burning rubber.

At a turn, Mr. Eddy steers his massive Mercedes and the 
Infiniti ahead on a gut-wrenching path off the road, up a 
mountain and into a little glade of trees.  Dust and brush 
fly everywhere.

Mr. Eddy and his assistants leap from the Pullman and make 
for the Driver's side of the Infiniti.

Mr. Eddy throws open the Infiniti's door and pulls the 
trembling and screaming Driver out like a rag doll.

Mr. Eddy pulls out his .44 Ruger Blackhawk and pistol whips 
the Driver to the ground.  He smashes the butt of his gun 
across the man's face, tearing a gash which starts to gush 
with blood.

Mr. Eddy's assistants each draw .45's and point them at the 
Driver.

Mr. Eddy, red-faced with anger, leans close to the man.

<b>				MR. EDDY
</b><b>		DON'T YOU EVER FUCKIN' TAILGATE.

Mr. Eddy hits the Driver in the side of the head with his 
gun.

Pete is on a skate - working under a car.  The radio is on 
and a tune comes on that begins to drive Pete crazy - it 
gives him a headache.  The tune is one of Fred Madison's be-
bop saxophone pieces.  Pete gets out from under the car and 
goes to the radio.  He changes the station.  PHIL, another 
mechanic working nearby, looks at Pete.

<b>				PHIL
</b>		Why'd you change it?  I liked that.

<b>				PETE
</b>		Well, I didn't.

Pete rubs his throbbing head and when he gets back under the 
car, he lays on the skate - unable to work.

A car horn honks and the sound reverberates inside the 
garage.

Pete looks up - from under the car he sees the wheels of a 
Cadillac roll up just outside the open garage doors.  He sees
a car door open and Mr. Eddy's feet appear and walk in his 
direction.

Pete winces and wheels himself out from under the car.  He 
stands as Mr. Eddy walks up to him, then freezes as he sees -
back behind Mr. Eddy, sitting in the passenger seat of the
car - a beautiful blonde-haired GIRL, who looks exactly like 
Renee.

CLOSE UP BEAUTIFUL GIRL - she looks exactly like Renee except
she is about eight years younger.  The girl is staring right 
into Pete's eyes.

Mr. Eddy steps between Pete and the girl - blocking her from 
Pete.  Mr. Eddy smiles at Pete - not noticing or not letting 
on that he notices the serious eye contact going on between 
Pete and the girl.

<b>				MR. EDDY

Mr Eddy pinches Pete's cheek - which Pete doesn't like, but 
aliows.  Mr. Eddy gives Pete a big smile then turns, goes 
back to his car, escorts the beautiful girl outside where the 
Pullman is waiting.

Pete watches her walk and move.  He watches her until Mr. 
Eddy drives her away.  She steals one last glance back at 
Pete before she disappears.

When she is gone, Pete replays the scene of seeing this 
beautiful girl over again in his mind.  The scene is

slowly in the room a MOTH'S wings beating against light 
bulbs in the ceiling fixture - the washing of DISHES.

Pete's reaction to these sounds is one of petrified 
confusion.  Underlying these sounds is a kind of unearthly, 
steady DRONE.

Pete gets up off the bed, unsteadily.  He moves toward his 
bedroom door.  As he moves the amplified SOUNDS shift.

He can hear laughter.  The laughter seems to be LOUD, but at 
the same time coming from people who are trying to contain 
the laughter - to hide it.

Pete opens his door and peers out.

Pete's POV down the hall toward the living room - his mother 
and father have stopped laughing and are turned with guilty 
smiles in his direction.  They are smoking a joint, passing 
it back and forth.  They are not looking directly at him.  
They seem to be looking, but not seeing.

Pete's parents POV down the hall toward Pete's room.  There 
is no one there - just an empty hallway.

Pete's parents continue to stare, but then turn away toward 
each other - they start to laugh quietly again.

Pete's Pov - the hallway and the living room - there is no 
one in the living room. It's empty.

streaming into an empty coffee cup.  The camera stays on the 
top of Al's head until he has completed the last few spurts 
of his micturition.  Al's head comes up and he opens the 
passenger side door and dumps the urine into the street.  He 
closes the door and zips up his trousers.

He drives past "Tops", but doesn't see anyone he knows.

He turns off the boulevard and drives through San Fernando 
valley neighborhood streets.

He pulls up in front of Sheila's house and honks his horn.

He lights a cigarette while he waits.

In a few minutes Sheila comes out and leans in the passenger 
side window.

<b>				SHEILA

Pete pulls over into a dark shadow under a tree and stops the 
car.

He cuts the engine, turns to Sheila and kisses her.  She 
breaks away.

<b>				SHEILA
</b>		Why don't you like me?

</b>		I do like you, Sheila.

Sheila puts her lips up' close to his and whispers.

Pete kisses her and she kisses him back.  They start to feel 
each other and Sheila takes off her tight sweater.  She's 
wearing no bra and Pete begins to feel her breasts while she 
unbuttons his shirt.  They continue to kiss hard throughout.

Pete is ragging off some grease from his hands when he 
notices a CAB pull up to the front of the garage.  The 
beautiful blonde steps out of the cab and comes up to him.

Pete's heart races - she smiles at him.

The light from headlights behind them catch Alice's

following them.

<b>				ALICE

		Is that car following us?

Pete glances in the rearview mirror - sees the headlights.

At the last moment he pulls a hard right and accelerates down 
the street.  The car follows - they both see it.

Alice steals a look back.

At a tralfic light, Pete revs up the big Camaro and expertly 
peels out between on-coming cross traffic.  He swerves 
between two cars going in opposite directions - blasts up a 
block and hangs a hard right - disappearing from view.

Ed and Al go out into the traffic after them, but the 
swerving, screeching cars braking around them form a barrier

Pete rides up the boulevard with the "Cruisers".  He spots 
"V's" car parked at "Tops".

He pulls in beside "V's" car and shuts down the engine.  The 
usual crowd is at the drive-in, including Sheila.

Pete goes up to "V" and Carl and says hello.  He lights a 
cigarette and leans up against a steel pole supporting the 
awning above.  "V" and Carl both notice that Pete is in a bad 
mood.

Sheila is over with her girlfriends.  She hasn't seen Pete 
arrive.

Suddenly Sheila looks over in Pete's direction.  She looks 
like she's seeing something, yet not seeing anything.  She 
keeps looking - staring.

Sheila's POV she sees "V", Carl and a lot of PEOPLE, but 
Pete is not there.

Pete looks at Sheila.  He's unsettled and confused by her 
staring, but not seeming to see him.  He watches her turn 
away and take one of her girlfriend's hands - leading her out 
to dance to the LOUD music.

Pete watches her dance.  Suddenly, he can't see her.  He 
thinks maybe she may be dancing on the other side of the 
building - out of view.  He moves to look and his head is 
struck by a violent pain.  He grabs his head with his hand 
and leans forward.  "V" grabs his arm.

<b>				"V"
</b>		You okay, man?

<b>				PETE
</b>		What?

<b>				"V"
</b>		You okay?... What's wrong7

Pete looks up at "V".  He doesn't seem to recognize him -
"V's" head is a featureless blur.  Pete shakes his head 
trying to drive out the pain.

He looks over again for Sheila.  He sees her there dancing 
with her girlfriend.

<b>				"V"
</b>		Pete... You okay?

<b>				PETE
</b>		Yeah.

Pete stands back up against the post - turns to "V" -
recognizing him.

<b>				PETE (CON'T) 
</b>		I'm, okay... You okay?

<b>				"V"
</b>		Sure, I'm okay.

Some drunk GUYS move over to Sheila and her girlfriend.  They 
cut in on the girls.  The guy with Sheila puts his hand 
around her waist and pulls her against her will into a grind.  
She tries to push him away, but he holds on tighter -
laughing with his buddy.

"V" and Carl look at Pete as he pushes off the post.  Pete 
crosses quickly to the man dancing with Sheila.  He slams his 
fist into the man's nose - almost snapping the man's neck in 
the process.  The man goes down bleeding.

Pete attacks the other man who is turning toward him ready 
for a fight.  He hits the man in the gut - the man's head 
goes down and Pete brings his knee up cracking the man's 
face.  The man's torso flies up with Pete's knee - then 
continues on as the man falls to the floor.  Pete picks him 
up, ready to hit him again, but the crowd pulls him off.

Pete stands and turns - pulsating with anger.  Sheila is 
there beside him.

<b>				SHEILA

<b>				PETE
</b>		I've been here.  You were lookin, right

<b>ALICE'S STORY
</b>
We see Alice wearing a sexy tight dress in a plain room. It 
feels like we are inside of a large building - maybe an 
office building.

Alice is waiting nervously.

A SLICKSTER in shiny shirt and pants is leaning against a 
closed door.

There is another door off the room which is open onto a room 
where a MUSCLE MAN in tiny briefs is doing bench presses.

No one is saying anything.

<b>				ALICE
</b>			(voiceover)
		I went to this place... They made me wait 
		forever.  There was some guy guardin' the 
		door... I started gettin' nervous... In 
		another room I could see some guy liftin'
<b>				(MORE)
</b>
				ALICE (cont'd)
		weights... Both these guys gave me the
		creeps... They never said anything to
		me... So I just smoked cigarettes and
		waited.

We move in on a nervous EXHALE OF SMOKE to a CLOSE UP of 
Alice waiting.

We see a CLOSE UP of the man guarding the door.

We see a CLOSE SHOT of the man bench pressing a lot of 
weight.

Suddenly, there are two knocks on the other side of the 
closed door.  The Slickster moves off the door and opens it a 
crack.  He talks quietly to someone Alice can't see, then he 
turns, opens the door and gestures for Alice to go through.

Alice puts out her cigarette - her hand is shaking.

She walks over past the Slickster and enters a much larger 
room.  There are about FIFTEEN MEN in the room - all leaning 
comfortably at different points on the walls.  There is only 
one chair in the room - Mr. Eddy is sitting in it.

No one says anything to her, but one man nods his head and 
from this nod, Alice feels she should walk to the center of 
the room.  She does, and she instinctively turns to the man 
sitting in the chair.

They all just stare at her silently.  She looks around 
nervously - her eyes return to Mr. Eddy's.

Suddenly, a man steps quickly up to her - draws a pistol and 
cocks it against her head.

Alice goes weak in the knees.  Her eyes fill with fear.

The men continue to stare.

Mr. Eddy gives Alice a small gesture as if to say "well?".

Somehow she knows what they want, even though they haven't 
asked for it with words.

Alice starts to undress - slowly - in as sexy a way as she 
knows how.

The men just stare without expression.

When she is completely naked, Mr. Eddy gestures her over to 
him.  Soon she is on her knees in front of him - making 
herself available for whatever he wants.

Mr. Eddy's POV - Alice looks in his eyes.  She reaches her 
hand up to stroke his cheek...

<b>				PETE (CON'T)
</b>		You liked it.

<b>				ALICE
</b>		If you want me to go away, I'll go away.

The feelings shift inside Pete.  Alice looks in his eyes.

<b>				PETE
</b>		I don't want you to go away.

Alice smiles a little - leans in and they kiss.

<b>				ALICE
</b>			(whispers)
		I love you, Pete.

They kiss some more.

<b>				PETE
</b>			(desperate whisper)
		I love you, Alice.

They start to make love - undressing each other and kissing 
all the while.  Alice stops.

<b>				ALICE
</b>		So, should I call Andy?

<b>				PETE
</b>		Andy?

<b>				ALICE
</b>		That's his name...Andy.  Our ticket out

<b>				PETE
</b>		Okay...

<b>				ALICE
</b>		Lemme call him now.  Make sure he's not
		already busy tomorrow night.

<b>				PETE
</b>		Okay.

Still entwined with each other, Alice reaches for the phone
and dials a number. It starts to ring and she smiles at Pete
when she hears it being answered.

<b>				ALICE
</b>		Andy?... It's me, Alice.  How ya doin?...
			(whispers)
		Andy... I can get away tomorrow night...
		I could come to your house... That sounds
		good... Around nine... Yeah, me too,
		Andy... Great... See ya then.

She hangs up the phone.

<b>				ALICE (CON'T)
</b>		Set.

<b>				PETE
</b>		Why are ya goin' so early?

<b>				ALICE
</b>		'Cause that's how long it's gonna take,
		baby.

<b>				PETE
</b>		What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?

<b>				ALICE
</b>		Are you kidding?... I've got so much on
		Andy, it isn't funny.

<b>				PETE
</b>		What about tonight?... Whatiya gonna do
		about Mr. Eddy tonight?

<b>				ALICE
</b>		I'm not goin' home tonight ... I'm goin'

			(off his look)
		To a girlfriend's house.
			(she smiles)
		But, we still have a coupla things to
		take care of...

<b>				PETE
</b>		Oh, yeah?... What else?

Alice reaches down between their legs.  Pete smiles.

<b>				ALICE
</b>		This... and this.

They start to go at it again - at first slowly and tenderly -
then wildly.  Alice tears herself away and looks up at Pete.

<b>				ALICE (CON'T)
</b>		Are you my man?

<b>				PETE
</b>			(getting hotter)
		Yes.

<b>				ALICE
</b>		Are you gonna be a man about this, Pete?

Pete looks at her - starting to understand what she means.

<b>				ALICE (CON'T)
</b>		Are you?

Pete stares at her - then nods.

<b>EXT. DAYTON HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
Pete drives up and parks his Camaro in the driveway.  When he 
gets out of the car, he sees Sheila standing by the front 
step.  She is looking in his direction, but doesn't seem to 
see him.  She SUDDENLY turns and looks up the street - she 
<b>YELLS.
</b>
<b>				SHEILA
</b>			(total horror)
<b>		THERE'S SOMEONE WITH HIM!!
</b>
As she yells, she starts to look around wildly - then her 
eyes follow the path the Camaro took into the driveway - then 
the path Pete took to where he has been standing all this 
time.  Her eyes find Pete and she stands by the front step.

<b>				PETE
</b>			(frightened)
		Sheila?

She heads toward him.

<b>				PETE
</b>		Sheila, what is it?... What are you doin'
		here?

<b>				SHEILA
</b>		You've been fucking somebody else haven't
		you?

<b>				PETE
</b>		Sheila...

<b>				SHEILA
</b>		You fuck me whenever you want... You
		don't call... Tell me who she is.

Sheila has come up and is grabbing Pete by the front of his 
shirt.

<b>				PETE
</b>		Hey... Sheila.

<b>				SHEILA
</b>		What's the BITCH'S name?!

<b>				PETE
</b>		Look Sheila... I'm sorry...

<b>				SHEILA
</b><b>		YOU'RE SORRY!!
</b>
<b>				PETE
</b>		Go home, Sheila.

Sheila starts beating him in the face and chest.

<b>				SHEILA
</b><b>		YOU'RE SORRY!! YOU PIECE OF SHIT!!
</b><b>		YOU'RE SORRY!!
</b>
She starts crying and hitting him harder.

<b>				SHEILA (CON'T)
</b><b>		FUCK YOU!!
</b>
Sheila's screaming is reverberating around the neighborhood.  
INSIDE PETE'S MIND the SOUNDS are even LOUDER.

Bill comes out of the house.  Claire is behind him waiting on 
the front porch.

Sheila beats Pete and trips him to the ground.  She is 
sobbing as she tears at him.

<b>				PETE
</b>		Sheila... Stop...

<b>				SHEILA
</b><b>		FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!!
</b>
Bill comes up to Sheila and takes her gently by the 
shoulders.

Sheila jerks around and looks up at Bill.

<b>				BILL
</b>		Why don't you two come inside and talk 
		things over quietly... Come on... Come on 
		in, Sheila.

Sheila gets to her feet - crying.  She looks down at Pete, 
who remains lying on the front lawn.

For Pete, every word and every sound is LOUD and DISTORTED.  
The DRONING SOUND returns.

<b>				SHEILA
</b>			(to Pete)
		You are different.

<b>				BILL
</b>		Sheila... 

<b>				SHEILA
</b>			(to Bill)
<b>		TELL HIM!
</b>
The phone inside the house starts to ring.  Claire turns in 
the doorway and goes to answer it.

<b>				BILL
</b>		Sheila... Don't.

<b>				SHEILA
</b>		I don't care anyway... I'm sorry, Mr. 
		Dayton... I won't bother you or any 
		member of your family again.

Sheila runs off crying.  Pete and Bill watch her go.

Claire comes to the door.

<b>				CLAIRE
</b>		Pete... There's a man on the phone.  He's
		called a couple of times tonight.

Pete pulls himself up.

<b>				PETE
</b>		Who is it?

<b>				CLAIRE
</b>		He won't give his name.

Pete walks slowly inside - stares at the phone and picks it 
up.

<b>				PETE
</b>		Hello.

<b>				MR. EDDY
</b>			(phone voice)
		Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?

<b>				PETE
</b>		Who is this?

<b>				MR. EDDY
</b>		You know who it is.

Bill and Claire have stopped in the living room - watching 
Pete.  Pete is going crazy with Mr. Eddy on one end, and his 
parents staring at him on the other.  He waves his parents 
away, but they leave slowly and reluctantly.

<b>				PETE
</b>		Mr. Eddy?

<b>				MR. EDDY
</b>		Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?

<b>				PETE
</b>		Okay.

<b>				MR. EDDY
</b>		You're doin, okay?  That's good, Pete.

<b>				PETE
</b>		Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...

<b>				MR. EDDY
</b>		I'm really glad you're doin' okay, Pete.

Pete doesn't know what to say.

<b>				MR. EDDY
</b>		You sure you're doin' okay? Everything
		all right?

<b>				PETE
</b>		Yeah.

<b>				MR. EDDY
</b>		That's good, Pete.  Hey... I want you to
		talk to a friend of mine.

Pete can hear the phone being handed over to someone.  There 
is a long silence.  Pete can hear breathing.

<b>				VOICE
</b>		We've met before, haven't we?

Pete freezes.  His mind is scrambling.

<b>				PETE
</b>		I don't think so.  Where was it that you
		think we've met?

<b>				VOICE
</b>		At your house.  Don't you remember?

<b>				PETE
</b>		No. No, I don't.

<b>				VOICE
</b>		We just killed a couple of people...

<b>				PETE
</b>		What?

Pete can hear Mr. Eddy laugh in the background.

<b>				VOICE
</b>		You heard me... We thought we'd come over
		and tell you about it.

Pete is getting pale with fear.

<b>				PETE
</b>		What's goin' on?

<b>				VOICE
</b>		Great question!! In the east ... the far 
		east... when a person is sentenced to 
		death... they're sent to a place where 
		they can't escape... never knowing when 
		an executioner will step up behind them 
		and fire a bullet into the back of their 
		head... it could be days... weeks... or 
		even years after the death sentence has 
		been pronounced... This uncertainty adds 
		an exquisite element of torture to the 
		situation, don't you think?  It's been a 
		pleasure talking to you.

Pete can hear the phone being passed again.

<b>				MR. EDDY
</b>		Pete... I just wanted to jump on and tell
		you I'm really glad you're doin' okay.

The phone goes dead and Pete sits - fearfully pondering his 
fate.  He hears a NOISE and turns.

Down at the far end of the hall he sees his parents staring 
at him.

CLOSE UP ON PARENTS staring in the direction of the living 
room as if sensing something, but not seeing.

PARENTS POV - The hall and living room beyond.  There is no 
one there.

We see a street sign saying "Deep Dell Place".  Pete walks up 
the street looking at numbers.

He finds 2224 Deep Dell Place - Andy's House.

He stares at the house from the sidewalk.

Lights are on upstairs and down.  The hot wind moves big 
shadows of trees over the front of the house.

Pete looks at his watch.  It reads: 11:05 p.m.

He walks down the driveway, crosses through some bushes and 
comes to a fence separating the front yard from the back.

He stops and listens.  He pulls himself up and over the 
fence, but crashes on something on the other side.

He freezes - listening. He hears the wind blowing through 
the trees, and distant music from inside - a slow jazz piece.  
He hears echoing sounds of love making.

He makes his way around back - goes up the stairs and tries 
the back door.  It opens.

<b>								     CUT TO:
</b><b>INT. ANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
Pete sneaks through the kitchen and comes into the living 
room.  Pete stops short and stares.  A movie projector is 
running in the living room.  A porno film is being projected 
on a huge screen at the far end.  Alice is in the porno film.  
A man is fucking her from behind - with LOUD SLAPPING SOUNDS 
of flesh banging flesh.  Her face is in the foreground.  Her 
eyes look out directly at Pete.  She is loving every minute 
of it.  Inside Pete, jealousy starts to rage out of control.  
He looks around.  He sees clothes scattered about.  He picks 
up a girl's sweater and smells it.  He looks up the stairs.

Feet appear at the top of the stairs.  They start down.

Pete runs for the bar.

Along the way, he grabs a heavy, bronze figurine of a well-
stacked woman off a rectangular glass-topped coffee table, 
and ducks behind the bar.

He can hear Andy approaching.  He can hear Andy gather two 
glasses.  He can hear Alice being fucked harder in the porno 
film.  He clenches his teeth with rage.

Suddenly, Andy moves right in front of him.  They see each 
other.  Andy's eyes widen - Pete leaps up, and thwacks the 
bronze figurine down on the top of Andy's head.  Andy falls.  
The breasts of the figurine have made two bloody holes in his 
forehead.

Pete turns.

Alice is coming quickly down the stairway - naked, except for 
a pair of panties.  Lipstick is smeared around her mouth.  
She is carrying a half-filled pillowcase.  Her porno film is 
playing on the wall 
behind her.

These images jump and spin in Pete's mind.  He moves 
unsteadily toward her.

<b>				ALICE
</b>		You got him.

<b>				PETE
</b>			(still holding the figurine)
		Alice, I...

Pete starts to tremble.  He drops the figurine.  He tries to 
embrace her.

There is a crashing noise behind him.

Pete turns and sees Andy staggering, blood streaming from the 
wound in his head, THEN CHARGING FULL SPEED AT PETE.

Andy hits him hard, and Pete goes down.  When Pete hits the 
ground, he pushes Andy up and throws out his arms.  This, and 
Andy's momentum, catapult Andy into the corner of the 
rectangular glass-topped coffee table.  There is a sound like a
hammer going through a bucket of eggs as the glass corner 
embeds about eight inches into Andy's forehead.

CLOSE UP OF ANDY'S HEAD - impaled on the sharp corner of the 
table, his chest area suspended, his legs and stomach 
touching the floor.

<b>				ALICE
</b>			(amazement - no feeling)
		Wow!

Pete pulls himself off the floor.

Pete moves close to Alice, they drift to the glass coffee 
table, staring for a few moments at Andy's dead body.

While Pete stares, unbelieving, at Andy - Alice hurriedly 
picks up her sweater and puts it on. On the sofa next to it 
lay Andy's trousers.  She goes through the pockets, finds a 
roll of cash bound by a rubber band.  Alice hands the roll to 
Pete.

<b>				ALICE (CON'T)
</b>		Put this in your pocket.

Alice kneels next to Andy's body and quickly removes his 
Rolex wristwatch, a couple of rings and the gold chain 
dangling from his neck.  These items she puts inside the 
empty pillowcase.

Alice finds the rest of her clothes scattered about the 
living room and puts them on.  Pete watches her, trembling, 
unable to say anything.

She comes back to Pete, who starts breathing irregularly, 
hyperventilating.

<b>				ALICE (CON'T)
</b>		You all right?

<b>				PETE,
</b>		We killed him.

<b>				ALICE
</b>		You killed him.

<b>				PETE
</b>		Alice?

Alice slides up close to Pete.

<b>				ALICE
</b>		It was an accident... Accidents happen
		every day.

Pete clutches her, eyes squeezed tight, as if he is holding 
on for dear life.

<b>				PETE
</b>		Alice...

<b>				ALICE
</b>			(pushing back)
		We gotta get the stuff and get out of
		here.

Alice starts off across the living room with the pillowcase.

Pete opens his eyes, he sees Alice move as a blur.  He looks 
around the room, which spins in and out of focus.  His eyes 
land on, a PHOTOGRAPH in a frame on the wall.  This photo 
troubles him.  Pete squints, then points to the photograph.

<b>				PETE
</b>		Is that you?  Are both of them you?

CLOSE UP OF THE PHOTOGRAPH - Four people appear in the frame: 
Andy, Renee, Alice and Mr. Eddy.

Alice stops and comes back.  She looks at the photo, walks 
closer to it, and points at herself.

<b>				ALICE
</b>		That's me.

She turns to Pete.  Pete is staring at the photograph - at 
Alice and Renee in the photograph.  His nose is bleeding
profusely.

<b>				ALICE (CON'T)
</b>		Pete?...

Pete starts to reel - blood from his nose soaking his shirt.

<b>				PETE
</b>		Where's the bathroom?

<b>				ALICE
</b>		Up the stairs - down the hall.

Pete runs up the stairs	- about to get sicker. Alice watches
him go with a nuance of	disdain.

</b>
Pete staggers toward the bathroom at the rear right of the 
hallway.  THE HALLWAY SUDDENLY BECOMES HAZY, DIFFERENT AND 
<b>LONGER THAN IT APPEARED TO BE.
</b>
Pete wanders down this "changed" hall.  On his left, he 
identifies a door with the number 25 on it.  He pauses for a 
moment in front of it, then goes on until, on his right, he 
comes to a door with the number 26 on it.  He enters through 
this door.

Inside is a WOMAN in front of a mirror with a MAN.  Her arms 
are resting on a shelf under the mirror as the man takes her 
from behind.  The man's face is blank, featureless, and is 
buried in the woman's back - we can't see it.

Pete now sees that the woman is an extremely whorish version 
of Alice - she's looking at Pete's reflection in the mirror.  
He's looking at her reflection in the mirror.  Pete's head is 
pounding.

<b>				WOMAN/ALICE
</b>			(to Pete)
		Did you want to talk to me?

Pete rubs his head - the pain is severe.

<b>				WOMAN/ALICE
</b><b>				(CON'T)
</b>			(laughs)
		Did you want to ask me "why"?

Pete staggers out of the room.

He closes the door.  The hallway has "changed" back to Andy's 
hallway.  The doors no longer have numbers.

Pete walks, unsteadily, back down the hall - faltering.  He 
starts down the stairs.

Pete comes downstairs to the living room and sees Alice at 
the desk in the corner, filling the pillowcase with cash and 
jewelry.

She has a PISTOL in her hand.

Alice turns when she hears Pete and they study each other's 
face as Pete makes his way to her.  His head is still 
throbbing with pain.  His focus goes from her face to the gun 
- which is pointing right at him - back to her.  Alice 
smiles.

<b>				ALICE
</b>		Don't you trust me, Pete?...

She laughs and hands him the pistol.

<b>				ALICE (CON'T)
</b>		Stick that in your belt.

She shows him the pillowcase filled with loot.

<b>				ALICE (CON'T)
</b>			(going through the loot)
		Look at all this shit... I know a

		passports in exchange for this and the

Alice jumps in Andy's car and tosses the bulging pillowcase 
in the back.  Pete takes the revolver out of his belt.  He 
opens the driver's side door of Andy's car and slowly sits 
inside.  He sets the pistol on the seat between them.  He 
looks up at her.  She smiles wildly.  Pete slalms the door -
starts the car and they drive off.

Alice and Pete pull up into the driveway of a house at the

house.

Pete's POV: He watches Alice ring the doorbell.  She waits 
in front of the door for a few moments, her hair blowing in 
the wind.

A HOUSEBOY opens the door.  Alice says something to him -
Pete cannot bear anything that is said, even though his 
driver's side window is down.  All he can hear is the hot 
wind blowing.

The Houseboy moves out to where he can see Pete, waiting in 
the car.  The Houseboy and Alice exchange information.  The 
Houseboy points out toward the desert.  Alice turns back to 
the car. The Houseboy watches her.

Pete and Alice drive up to a ONE ROOM CABIN built on stilts 
next to a dry lakebed.  They both get out and go up the 
stairs to a porch where Alice knocks on the door.  There is 
no answer.

Alice opens the door, but there is NOBODY INSIDE.

<b>				ALICE
</b>		We'll have to wait.

The hot wind continues to blow.

Alice and Pete walk back down to the car.

The HEADLIGHTS are on and Alice reaches in through the window 
and switches on the RADIO.  She can't get anything in but 
static, with bits and pieces of old tunes fading in and out.  
She hits the "seek" button.  The radio starts to search.

Pete is standing in the glare of the headlights watching her.  
Alice walks slowly to him.

The camera captures this from a back seat perspective - then 
drifts toward them.

<b>				PETE
</b>		Why me, Alice?  Why choose me?

The radio sticks on a particular tune - a tune filled with
longing. Alice begins to dance.  She takes Pete's hand and
pulls him close to her.

<b>				ALICE
</b>		So we can be together... You still want
		to be with me, don't you Pete?

Alice gives Pete that wild smile.

<b>				ALICE (CON'T)
</b>		More than ever?

She kisses Pete over and over.  He begins to kiss her back.  
She starts to move him in a dance to the music in the glare 
of the headlights, the hot wind caressing them.

The scene is out of a dream.  Alice and Pete help each other 
undress as they dance in and out of the light, and the wind 
whips at their bodies.

They sink down on the soft ground and start making love.

The lights from the headlights combine with the starlight, 
bathing them in a pristine glow.

The music fades and the radio begins to "seek" through static 
for another station.  The music it finds now is LOUD and 
<b>INTENSE.
</b>
Alice - her hunger appearing, now becomes carnivorous in her 
approach to love making with Pete.  She is the aggressor, 
highly-charged - she wants more and more - taking, not 
giving, insatiable.

The headlights flare their bodies in blinding light.  They 
become amorphous, glowing shapes burning in the light.

Pete is trying desperately to please her - to have her.

The driving music fills with cracks of piercing static.  The 
radio strains to hold the station.

Pete's white-hot body clings to Alice.  He chokes with 
emotion.

<b>				PETE
</b>		I want you... I want you...

With a burning smile, Alice rolls them out of the beams of 
light into the darkness.  The wind billows a black cloud of 
dust around them.

Alice pulls away from Pete and brings her dark mouth to his 
ear.

<b>				ALICE
</b>		You'll never have me.

Alice glides away from Pete and stands up looking down at him 
from above.

She turns and walks, naked, to the cabin where she disappears 
within it.

Pete turns, face down on the ground in the darkness.  He's 
holding his head and shaking.

As he starts to stand - he turns into the glare of the
headlights and we see that it is NOT PETE - BUT FRED.

As Fred stands up, the car's LIGHTS DIM and the RADIO FADES.

Fred looks at the car.  He sees some movement inside.  Fred 
looks closer and sees the figure of a man in the back seat.

CLOSE UP OF THE MAN - it's the Mystery Man from Andy's party.

<b>				VOICE FROM BEHIND
</b><b>				FRED
</b>		Hello.

Fred turns toward the cabin and sees the Mystery Man now 
standing in the doorway.

Fred turns again to the car, but this time it's empty.  He 
looks back at the cabin and sees the Mystery Man still in the 
doorway.

<b>				MYSTERY MAN
</b>		Here I am.

Fred is dizzy with fear and confusion.

He pulls on his trousers and shoes and walks up the steps to 
the cabin toward the Mystery Man, who goes inside.  Fred 
stops in the doorway.  He looks around.

<b>				FRED
</b>		Where's Alice?

<b>				MYSTERY MAN
</b>		Alice who?

Fred looks around again but there is no one there except the 
Mystery Man - standing in the center of the room.  Fred 
stares at him.

<b>				MYSTERY MAN
</b><b>				(CON'T)
</b>		Her name is Renee.  If she's told you her
		name is Alice, she's lying.
			(filled now with anger)
<b>		AND YOUR NAME, WHAT THE FUCK IS YOUR
</b><b>		NAME?!
</b>
Fred freaks, scared to death. He bolts down the stairs to 
the car, stumbling more than once. 

Fred attempts to start the car which is drained of electrical 
charge by the use of the headlights and radio.

The Mystery Man appears in the doorway of the cabin.  He 
starts toward Fred.

The starter motor moans as Fred twists the key frantically.

The smiling Mystery Man is almost at the car,

The engine catches.  Fred revs it - throws the car in reverse 
and peels out away from the Mystery Man, whose hand is
reaching for him.

Fred swerves the car around - throws it in drive, and takes 
off across the dark desert.

Fred is driving along the two-lane desert "lost highway".  
The wind is picking up even stronger than before.  A big 
storm is blowing in.

Fred sees a sign glowing just ahead that reads: LOST HIGHWAY 
HOTEL.  The sign is swaying and blinking as the gusts hit it.

Fred pulls in and stops under the sign and stares at it.

He gets out of the car, tucks the pistol in his belt under 
his shirt and enters the hotel, which is an old two-story

Fred smokes the cigarette, listening to the wind blow.  
Lightning cracks outside the window.

Fred crushes the cigarette out in the ashtray on the bedside

<b>INT. LOST HIGHWAY HOTEL - ROOM 26 - PRE-DAWN
</b>
Renee is sitting half dressed on the edge of the bed, pulling 
on her stockings.  Mr. Eddy/Laurent is asleep next to her.  
Renee stands up, finishes dressing, then leans down and 
kisses her lover while he sleeps.  Renee leaves the room, 
closing the door as quietly as possible behind her.

As the door CLICKS, Mr. Eddy/Laurent wakes up.  He sits up 
and gets a pack of cigarettes from the bedside table, shakes 
one out, lights it with a book of "Lost Highway Hotel" 
matches, and smokes it while seated on the edge of the bed.

</b>
<b>INT. LOST HIGHWAY HOTEL - ROOM 25 - PRE-DAWN
</b>
Fred, still fully dressed, is waking up, AS IF IN A TRANCE -
the same attitude he had on the videotape.  He strains 
upwards and looks eerily around the room.  He gets up and 
crosses slowly to a window.  He takes the edge of the window 
curtain and pulls it back.

The view is of the gravel parking lot of the hotel.

Fred's POV: He sees Renee, down below, walk over to a car, 
get in and drive away.

Fred walks back to his bed, picks up his revolver from under 
the pillow, crosses the room to the door and walks out.

<b>								    CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. LOST HIGHWAY HOTEL - CORRIDOR - PRE-DAWN
</b>
Fred crosses over to Room 26 and knocks softly on the door.

<b>								    CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. LOST HIGHWAY HOTEL - ROOM 26 - PRE-DAWN
</b>
Mr. Eddy/Laurent is standing - almost dressed, when he hears 
the knock.

<b>				MR. EDDY/LAURENT
</b>		Renee?

He goes to the door and opens it a crack.

As the door opens, Fred smashes the gun into Mr. Eddy/ 
Laurent's face and pushes his way inside the room.

Fred hits Mr. Eddy/Laurent viciously again with the gun 
barrel.

Mr. Eddy/Laurent is bleeding profusely from gashes on his 
forehead and nose.

<b>				MR. EDDY/LAURENT
</b>		What the fuck? What's going on?

<b>				FRED
</b>			(pointing the gun at him)
		You're coming with me.

Fred puts the pistol up against Mr. Eddy/Laurent's head and 
marches him out of the room - past the camera's eye.

The camera stays in the room and moves slowly toward the 
window, through which we see Fred and Mr. Eddy/Laurent appear 
down below in the back lot.

Still watching out the window, the camera sees Fred knock Mr. 
Eddy/Laurent over the head with the gun butt and put him into 
the trunk of a car.  Fred slams the trunk lid and climbs into 
the driver's side of what is obviously Mr. Eddy/Laurent's car 
- the Mercedes 600 Pullman.

As Fred drives away, a HAND appears in our window foreground. 
The hand moves the window curtain further to one side.  The 
camera pulls back to reveal it as the hand of the Mystery 
Man.  The Mystery Man leans fully into the frame and watches 
Fred drive off down the Lost Highway as day breaks.

</b>
<b>EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAYBREAK
</b>
Fred is driving along the road.  Suddenly he pulls the car 
off the road and drives over the dirt and brush to a deserted 
spot, stops and gets out.

Fred opens the trunk. When he does ...

Suddenly, Mr. Eddy/Laurent charges up and attacks Fred -
knocking them both to the ground.  Mr. Eddy/Laurent tries to 
strangle Fred, but Fred's anger is too great.  Fred tears 
loose and gets Mr. Eddy/Laurent in a hold bending his head 
back.  Fred's hand reaches out behind him - feeling, 
searching.

A KNIFE appears.

it comes into Fred's hand from another.

Fred slices Mr. Eddy/Laurent's throat, and throws him down.

Mr. Eddy/Laurent squirms on the ground - his hand grasped 
around his throat - trying to hold his neck together.  Blood 
is flowing rapidly through his fingers and over the front of 
him as be turns and opens his mouth with a gurgling sound.

Fred stands, facing him, his pistol out now - pointing right 
at Mr. Eddy/Laurent's forehead.

CLOSE UP ON MR. EDDY/LAURENT - he lifts his head and stares 
at Fred.  Blood is rushing out of him.

<b>				MR. EDDY/LAURENT
</b>			(wet and jagged)
		What do you guys want?

The camera pans around to Fred - we see that the Mystery Man 
is standing beside Fred, and it is the Mystery Man who is 
holding the gun, not Fred.

The Mystery Man reaches into his pocket and pulls out a 
little watchman TV.  He turns it on and hands it over to Mr. 
Eddy/Laurent, who manages to take it.

Mr. Eddy/Laurent looks down at the small television screen.

Mr. Eddy/Laurent's POV: As he watches the TV screen, we move 
in until the screen fills the frame - as with the former 
videotapes.  The full frame of the TV screen reveals -

<b>INT. ANDY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
We see the movie screen on a wall in Andy's living room.  
Marian, Raquel and RENEE'S images are being projected on this 
screen, simultaneously involved in pornographic acts with two 
men. Watching this movie in Andy's living room are several 
people in shadows behind the light of the projector.  Among 
them we see RENEE and MR. EDDY/LAURENT standing next to ANDY.
Mr. Eddy/Laurent and Renee are hot - kissing - his hand is up 
under her skirt.  They are watching the porno film.  They are 
watching murky images of sex turning to violence.

In a CLOSE UP we see Renee and Mr. Eddy/Laurent in the 
shadows looking out at the film, both half-smiling, stoned, 
aroused.

The image on the Watchman changes now.

<b>EXT. DESERT - DAYBREAK
</b>
On the Watchman TV screen Mr. Eddy/Laurent sees an image of 
Fred and the Mystery Man staring at him.  The Mystery Man's 
image speaks.

<b>				MYSTERY MAN
</b>			(on TV screen)
		Now you can hand it back to me.

Mr. Eddy/Laurent sees the Mystery Man's image reach out a 
hand.

Mr. Eddy/Laurent looks up.  The Mystery Man has his arm 
outstretched just as it was on the video image.  Mr. Eddy/ 
Laurent hands the Watchman back, and locks eyes with the 
Mystery Man.

<b>				MR. EDDY/LAURENT
</b>			(wet and jagged)
		You and me, mister, we can really out-
		ugly the sumbitches, can't we?

The mystery Man unloads the pistol into Mr. Eddy/Laurent, who 
jerks and dies in the dust.

The Mystery Man then leans close to Fred and whispers in his 
ear.

The camera moves in, past the Mystery Man to a CLOSE UP OF 
FRED'S EYES as he listens.

The camera cuts back wide to reveal Fred holding the gun.  He 
is standing alone - there is no Mystery Man.  Fred turns to 
go back to the car.

<b>EXT. THE MADISON HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - EARLY MORNING
</b>
Fred drives up to his house in Mr. Eddy/Laurent's Mercedes 
600 Pullman and stops in front.  He gets out of the car, goes 
to the front door and RINGS THE DOORBELL.  There is a BEEP sound.

<b>				FRED
</b>			(into intercom)
		Dick Laurent is dead.

</b>
<b>EXT. THE MADISON HOUSE - STREET - EARLY MORNING
</b>
As Fred finishes this sentence we see the cop car containing 
Ed and Al pull in to the curb just up the street from Fred 
and Renee's house.

<b>								      CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. THE MADISON HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - EARLY MORNING
</b>
Fred turns and sees the cop car.  He jumps in his car, fires 
it up, and peels out.  The cops give chase.

<b>								      CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY
</b>
Fred is behind the wheel of his car.  Behind him are the 
cops.

CLOSE UP ON FRED'S FACE - through the front windshield.  The 
shot is wide enough to reveal the cop car in hot pursuit.

Fred's face begins to change again, grotesquely contorting as 
he races into the vortex.  His tormented SCREAM blends with 
the howling SIREN of the police car gaining on him.
