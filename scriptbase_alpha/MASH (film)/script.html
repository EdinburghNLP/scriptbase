1	 FADE IN

EXT. LANDING AREA IUTSIDE 4077th MASH - DAY

Our attention is concentrated on a sign reading: "THIS IS WHERE
IT IS - PARALLEL 38."  Below these words, arrows point to "NORTH
KOREA" in one direction, "SOUTH KOREA" in opposite one.  Two Air
Rescue helicopters are coming in low from the north, descending
to a point just outside the entrance to the hospital Admitting
Ward.  Transferring our attention to the helicopters, our gaze
goes from the first sign to a second one, on which all we can
read at first are the very large letters: "M-A-S-H."  Moving
closer to the helicopters as they hit the ground, we can make out
the rest of the sign.  Above the four large letters it says:
"4077TH," and then we see there is the remainder of a word
following each of the large letters, but in much smaller print,
so that "M-A-S-H" becomes "Mobile Army Surgical Hospital."  The
helicopters land and enlisted men of the U.S. Army Medical Corps
Carry two wounded soldiers from each into the Admitting Ward.

LIEUTENANT COLONEL HENRY BLAKE, a permanent member of the Medical
Corps and Commanding Officer of the 4077th, watches grimly as the
wounded are borne from the helicopters into his hospital.
CORPORAL "RADAR" O'REILLY, with a long thin neck, large ears and
a knack for anticipating his Colonel's wishes, moves up close
behind him.

		HENRY
	  (loudly)
	O'Reilly!

		RADAR
	  (at his side)
	Yes, sir?

		HENRY
	Dammit, Radar, wait till I call
	you!  Tell Major Burns...

		RADAR
	One of the surgeons from the
	day shift will have to stay on
	duty tonight?

		HENRY
	Yes, dammit, and...

He interrupts himself, frightened by the intense expression
on Radar's face.  The Corporal's head is turning back and forth
like an actual radar receiver, monitoring the northern horizon
where the valley of a river meanders between mountainous ridges.

		HENRY
	O'Reilly, what is it?
	  (appalled at
	  the thought)
	There aren't more choppers coming?

		RADAR
	I'm afraid so, Colonel.

		HENRY
	We've got too many wounded for
	us to handle now!  Get on the
	phone right away and...

		RADAR
	Yes, sir, I'll see if I can
	reach General Hammond in Seoul
	for you.  You think he'll finally
	break down and give us two more
	surgeons?

The DISTANT SOUND of more HELICOPTERS becomes faintly audible to
the normal human ear, and a moment later one appears over a ridge.

							TIME LAPSE:

2	 EXT. MOTOR POOL AND RAILROAD DEPOT - 325TH EVACUATION HOSPITAL -
  YONG-DONG-PA - DAY

Two officers come from opposite directions toward a Jeep, each
carrying a Valpac and trailing a barracks bag.  Though they
still wear such later-to-be-discarded refinements as captain's
bars on their caps and overcoats, they are far from West Point
standards in dress and manner.  DUKE, 29, is still solidly built
like the fullback he once was.  HAWKEYE, 28, a former end, is
taller and rangier, wears glasses.  Their accents, Georgia and
Maine respectively, are in sharp contrast. A MOTOR POOL SARGEANT
who has driven the Jeep up climbs out.

		MOTOR POOL DRIVER
	You the guys going to the 4077th?

		DUKE
	I'm one of 'em.

		HAWKEYE
	  (state of Maine
	  affirmative)
	Ayuh.  I'm the other then.

   As they stow their gear in the back of the Jeep.

		MOTOR POOL SARGEANT
	Lots of luck.

He leaves.

		HAWKEYE
	My name's Hawkeye Pierce.

		DUKE
	Duke Forrest.

Hawkeye takes the driver's seat.  Duke, getting into the
right-hand side, has no objection, just a question.

		DUKE
	You got directions?

		HAWKEYE
	Ayuh, only it's early, I need a
	drink to wake me up.

		DUKE
	I got some.

He turns around and opens his barracks bag, where he finds a pint
bottle conveniently located near the top.

		HAWKEYE
	Make it yourself, or is it real?

		DUKE
	Georgia, where I come from, it's
	real if you make it yourself.
	But I been buying from the Yankee
	Government since they put me in
	this soldier suit and give me a
	rate.

		HAWKEYE
	Tax-free booze.  It's about all
	you can say for army life.

		DUKE
	  (passing bottle)
	Where you from with that crazy
	way of talking?

		HAWKEYE
	Crabapple Cove.  Maine.

		DUKE
	Damn!  That must be about as far
	north as you can get.

		HAWKEYE
	Pretty near.  What do you know
	about the outfit we're going to?

		DUKE
	C.O. is Colonel Blake.  Lieutenant
	Colonel Henry Braymore Blake.
	One of them regular army clowns.
	Push you around so it's hard to
	get any decent work done.

		HAWKEYE
	We got to head them off, right at
	the start.  Push them around first.

They have exchanged the bottle a couple of times.  In the act of
raising it to his mouth, Hawkeye looks toward the hospital doorway.

		HAWKEYE
	I think we already caught their
	eye.

Two MPs have emerged from the hospital administration offices and
are heading toward them.  Hawkeye goes into action quickly, starting
the Jeep engine.

		DUKE
	What's the initials 'MP' stand
	for, Hawkeye?

		HAWKEYE
	Shore Patrol, Duke.  Let's go!

The Jeep starts off at its maximum takeoff speed and accelerates
dangerously as it careens out of the hospital grounds.

							TIME LAPSE:

3	 EXT. ROAD NEAR OUIJONGBU - DAY

Hawkeye and Duke are driving the Jeep along the muddy road - they come upon
a sign which fills a large part of the screen: "Last chance before Peking."
A short distance behind the sign, it is now revealed are three parked U.S.
Army trucks, in front of which parades a group of Korean prostitutes from
fourteen to forty-five.  Despite the autumn weather, their costumes, mixed
American mail order and Korean, are chosen for seductive appeal rather than
warmth.

		HAWKEYE
	Must be the Famous Curb Service
	Whore -
	 (pronounced
	 'howah')
	House.  You in the market Duke?

		DUKE
	  (in negation)
	I done my shopping in Seoul last
	night.

They now have a fairly clear view of a GI and a Korean female lying
in tight formation in the bed on one of the trucks, their activity
only partially concealed by a blanket.

		DUKE
	Curb service is right.

							TIME LAPSE:

4	 EXT. APPROACH TO 4077TH MASH - DAY

Hawkeye stops the Jeep as they come to a place in the road where they can
get a downward look at their future home.  The river valley in which the
4077th Mash is situated is almost surrounded by mountains.  The components
of the post are spread out in a rough horseshoe with a large compound of
level ground in the middle.  At the closed end of the horseshoe is the main
hospital building, made of wood with a tin roof marked by a large red cross;
everything else is canvas.  To the left of the main building are strung out
the Admitting Ward, Laboratory, Dental Clinic, Mess Hall, PX, Showers Tent,
Barber Tent and the Enlisted Men's Tents.  On the right side are the Postop
Ward, Officers' Tents, Nurses' Tents, Korean Domestics' Tents and finally,
the Officers' Club.  In the f.g., from Duke and Hawkeye's angle are four
helicopters belonging to the 5th Air Rescue Squadron, and the signs we have
already seen marking the post and the 38th Parallel.

		HAWKEYE
	Well, there it is.  Jesus!

		DUKE
	The spot we picked to spend the
	winter.  Maybe we ought to look
	a little harder.

			 				BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

5	 INT. MASH MESS HALL - DAY

as Hawkeye and Duke enter.  The large tent has two floor levels separated by
a railing into a section for officers and one for enlisted men, the two
groups being much closer to numerical equality here than in an ordinary
military installation.  There is a further voluntary piece of segregation
within the officers' section: the men - medical officers plus a couple of
administrative officers and a helicopter pilot - are at one long, rectangular
table; the nurses, ranging in rank from second lieutentant to captain, at
another.

Hawkeye starts to lead the way to an empty table in the officers' section,
but Duke calls his attention to the outstanding feature of the nurses'
table: LIEUTENTANT DISH, twenty-four, blonde and clearly, even in her winter
fatigues, the sexiest looking nurse in military history.

		DUKE
	What do you think of that piece of
	scenery, Yankee boy?

		HAWKEYE
	Finest kind.  We'll sit where we
	can get the best view.

Accordingly, they select seats close to the nurses and facing the Lieutenant.
Some personnel are on duty in the hospital during this lunch period, but
beside Dish, two of the following three nurses with whom we will become
acquainted are present here:

KNOCKO, who is black, a captain in her thirties, solidly built, very strong
and very competent in her job; LESLIE, also a captain, not more than thirty,
bright, attractive, cheerful, the kind of girl that brings out the latent
male matrimonial instinct but who, strangely, is treated as inviolate by the
by the sex-starved men of the post; and LIEUTENANT SCORCH, who can't match
Dish or Leslie by physical standards but has the asset of instant
availability.

A Korean boy, not yet of military age, in green fatigue pants and
an off-white coat, appears promptly and heaps Duke and Hawkeye's
plates with food.  Duke is hungry enough to turn his whole attention
to the meal, but Hawkeye is unable to keep his eyes off Lieutenant
Dish while eating.  Thus neither of them is aware of the attention
they are getting from the male officers' group, which includes HENRY,
a couple of medical captains named MURRHARDT and BANDINI; DAGO RED
(officially, Father John Patrick Mulcahy, red-haired Catholic Chaplain
of the area) and the PAINLESS POLE (Captain Walter Waldowski, Dental
Officer), both in their thirties; and CAPTAIN UGLY JOHN BLACK, an
Australian anesthesiologist.

There is also curiousity about the newcomers from the unlisted men's
section, where we see among others RADAR; VOLLMER, Henry's overweight
Sargeant Major; CORPORAL JUDSON, young, black and fresh from Mississippi;
PRIVATE BOONE, who looks too young and nervous to be in any man's army;
and PFC SEIDMAN, whose first trip out of New York has taken him halfway
around the world.

Henry, who alone has reason to be personally affronted by Duke and
Hawkeye's unmilitary behavior, gets up and crosses to where they are
sitting.

		HENRY
	I'm Colonel Blake.  You fellows
	just passing through?

		HAWKEYE
	Nope, we're assigned heah.

With which reminder we will abandon all indications of the Maine accent.

		DUKE
	Y'all were short a couple cutters
	and we're what the Army sent.

		HENRY
	Don't you know the first thing
	you're supposed to do at a new
	post is present yourself to the
	commanding officer with your orders?

		DUKE
	Reckon so, but we been boozing
	all day and you work up an appetite.

		HENRY
		 (taking out orders
	  and handing Duke
	  a copy)
	You're welcome to one of these,
	whatever they are.

		DUKE
	  (finding his orders)
	They give you copies to burn.

Henry scans both papers to find what he considers the most important part.
There is a RUMBLE OF ARTILLERY in the distance.

		HENRY
	Good.  You've both been working
	close to the front.

		DUKE
	  (listening to
	  artillery)
	Never this close.

		HENRY
	They've hit us on Cherry Hill.  I
	just got word.  We have our slack
	periods but when the action starts,
	you'll have more work in twelve
	hours than a civilian surgeon does
	in a week.

		HAWKEYE
	Colonel Blake, have no fear.
	Hawkeye and Duke are here.

		DUKE
	  (to Henry)
	That's right, pal.  You just sit
	up front and sign the mail, and
	leave the cutting to us.

		HENRY
	I may need you to go to work
	practically immediately.  But
	meanwhile perhaps you'd like to
	meet some of your fellow officers.

		DUKE
	Just one for a start.

		HAWKEYE
	The blonde dish.

		HENRY
	If you mean...
	  (looking toward
	  Lieutenant Dish)
	She is a lieutenant in the Army
	Nursing Corps, Captain.

		HAWKEYE
	Okay, Lieutenant Dish.  I guess
	she's already...involved with
	somebody here.

		HENRY
	They've all tried.  Nobody's got
	to first base.

He is interrupted by the fact that Dish and Knocko have risen from their
table and are passing right by them on their way to the door.  The
Lieutenant has just as nice a walk as you would hope for, and the men's
eyes follow her till she is again out of hearing distance.

		HAWKEYE
	Why bother with first base?
	I'd go right for the home run.

The Painless Pole and Dago Red have come over.

		DAGO RED
	This the new talent, Henry?

		HENRY
	Captain Pierce, Captain Forrest...
	Father Mulcahy, the Catholic
	Chaplain of the area, and Captain
	Waldowski, our Dental Officer.

		PAINLESS
	Better known as Painless Pole.

Murrhardt and Bandini come over and all ADLIB introductions - asking each
other their backgrounds, etc.

		BANDINI
	We all call him Dago Red.

		DUKE
	I'm Duke and he's Hawkeye.

		PAINLESS
	Glad to know you.  Drop in at my
	clinic anytime you feel like
	playing a little poker, or even
	if a tooth is bothering you.

		HAWKEYE
	Poker sounds great.  When do you
	play?

		MURRHARDT
	He said anytime.  Day and night,
	seven days a week.  The players
	change but the game never stops.

		HENRY
	  (to Hawkeye and Duke)
	You'll be living with Major Burns.
	O'Reilly!

Before his name is uttered, Radar has already risen from the enlisted men's
group, and is now at Henry's side.

		RADAR
	Sir?

		HENRY
	Don't do that, Radar!  You make
	me nervous.

		RADAR
	Sir?

		HENRY
	Don't come so quickly when I
	call.  I want you to take these
	officers...

		RADAR
	To Major Burns' tent.  Yes, sir.

		HENRY
	Stop that, O'Rielly!

		RADAR
	Sir?

		HENRY
	Oh, get out of here!

		RADAR
	Yes, Colonel.

			 				BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

6	 EXT. AND INT. "THE SWAMP" (PRESENTLY FRANK'S TENT) - DAY

Hawkeye and Duke drag their bags from the Jeep, which Radar drives away.
They look over their new residence, a standard army tent, square with
peaked roof, a wooden door attached to the canvas.  Then as they approach
it, they become aware of a youthful Korean voice reading, in heavily
accented English, words that have no meaning for the speaker.

		HO-JON'S VOICE
	  (o.s.)
	'Yea, though I walk through the
	valley of the shadow of death...'

		DUKE
	Jesus Christ!

		HAWKEYE
	One of his ancestors, I think.

		HO-JON'S VOICE
	  (o.s.)
	'I shall fear no evil for Thou
	art with me...'

They open the door of the tent and go in.  There are three canvas cots
with sleeping bags on them, a plank floor, an oil stove, electric light,
a few crude shelves, one table and one chair plus assorted crates
serving as same.

MAJOR FRANK BURNS, 35, from Wisconsin, is sitting on one of the two more
favorably situated cots listening to HO-JON, a Korean boy of 16, read
from the Bible.  He corrects the word that has given Ho-Jon the most
trouble.

		FRANK
	Thou.  For Thou art with me.
	  (sees Duke and
	  Hawkeye, jumps up)
	Welcome, welcome, welcome!

		DUKE
	What the hell's going on here?

		FRANK
	This is Ho-Jon, my houseboy.
	Our houseboy.  I'm teaching him
	English.

		DUKE
	Where's he gonna use that kind
	of talk?  'The valley of the
	shadow of death.'  Wait a minute,
	Ho-Jon...
	  (rummages in
	  barracks bag)
	I got something for you.

He takes out sex magazine, gives it to Ho-Jon in such a way that we see
the nude on the cover, but Frank doesn't.

		DUKE
	  (to Frank)
	Little light reading matter.
	Just right for his age.

		HAWKEYE
	  (to Duke)
	Well, southern boy, I suppose
	you want the sack that's convenient
	to the door.

		DUKE
	And gets the wind every time it
	opens.  No, thanks.  I'll take
	that one.

He indicates the unoccupied cot which, like Frank's, is at the rear of the
tent with the stove between it and the front door.  Hawkeye shrugs and
reaches into his barracks bag.

		HAWKEYE
	Let's choose for it.
	  (finds baseball bat,
	  hands it to Duke)
	You toss.

Duke tosses the bat vertically in the air.  As it comes down Hawkeye grabs
it expertly at the tape with his left hand.  Duke puts his left hand above
that, and Duke is left with his right hand waving in the air with nothing
to grab.

		HAWKEYE
	  (to Ho-Jon)
	Part of your education.  Always
	use your own bat.

He tosses Valpac onto the desired cot.

							TIME LAPSE:

7	 INT. ADMITTING WARD - NIGHT

It's pretty full already and more wounded are being brought in by corpsmen.
In contrast to the opening scene, where the casualties were a generalized
fact seen at a distance, in this scene they are viewed individually and at
close range, and the effect, both on the eye and the ear, is almost
unbearable.  Hawkeye, in a white gown as are all the surgeons and nurses,
moves from a patient he has just examined to one who is letting out a
number of unintelligible SOUNDS mixed in with such clear and frequently
repeated words as "Christ," "Mother," "God damn" and "Please."  As Hawkeye
approaches, Lieutentant Scorch removes enough of the bandaging done in the
field to display an abdomen with part of its contents on the outside.

		HAWKEYE
	Two-man job.  How much blood
	has he had?

		LIEUTENANT SCORCH
	Second pint.

		HAWKEYE
	Duke...

Duke has just examined a patient.  He takes a step towards Hawkeye.

		HAWKEYE
	This kid's ready but we won't
	know all the damage till we get in
	and see what's happened.  What
	have you got?

		DUKE
	Nothing can't wait.  Shall we
	check it out with the Major?

He indicates a Major who is standing a short distance away, looking like
a boss but not actually doing anything.  Also in Admitting Ward are,
Murrhardt, Lieutentant Dish, PFC Seidman, Corporal Judson.

		HAWKEYE
	Naw, I already found out.  The
	only thing he doesn't like about
	being in charge is making decisions.

							TIME LAPSE:

8	 INT. OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

(NOTE:  ALL PRINCIPAL CAST SHOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR ALL OPERATING SCENES)

There are three operations going on at once.  Here all personnel wear white
caps and masks and it is hard to identify individuals except that at close
range we can distinguish Hawkeye by his glasses and Duke by his eyes and
his build.  They are working together with great efficiency and an
instinctive collaboration that seems to require no verbal exchange.  What
we see them do, without necessarily recognizing the portion of anatomy
involved, is to cut out a section of bowel damaged by a shell fragment,
and start sewing the divided ends together.

							TIME LAPSE:

9	 INT. OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

Hawkeye and Duke are working together on the last stages of a leg
amputation.  This time there is no doubt about the surgical process we are
watching; we see the almost severed leg and the process of controlling
bleeding; then the limb is actually separated from its stump and handed
by Duke to a corpsman.  Hawkeye speaks to the nurse standing behind him.

		HAWKEYE
	Hot pack.

Watching her dip the pack into a warm solution and wring it out, he
recognizes, despite cap and mask, that it is Lieutenant Dish.  His eyes
linger on hers for a brief moment.

							TIME LAPSE:

10	EXT. OUTSIDE OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

Lieutenant Dish comes out of the Operating Room, tears in her eyes, trying
to control her sobs, and moves just outside the circle of light from the
fixture over the entrance.  There, no longer under observation, she lets
herself cry.  Hawkeye comes out the door, registers surprise at the sight
of her just as if he hadn't followed her out.  He moves to her side and
puts a comforting arm around her.  She looks up just long enough to see
who it is, then buries her head on his shoulder as his other arm goes
around her.

		LIEUTENANT DISH

	Isn't this ridiculous, Doctor?
	Six months I've been here and
	there are still times when I
	can't stand it.  I just go to
	pieces.

		HAWKEYE
	There's nothing ridiculous
	about it.
	  (turns her face
	  up to his)
	A kid like you...

She doesn't move her head from the way he has arranged it, and her lips
are very close to his.  He kisses her and it turns out, from the ardent
way she responds, that's what she wanted him to do.

		LIEUTENANT DISH
	Thank you, Captain Pierce.
	  (her voice full
	  of need)
	It's been so long.

		HAWKEYE
	No trouble at all.
	  (then)
	Hawkeye.

		LIEUTENANT DISH
	How did you get called that?

		HAWKEYE
	'The Last of the Mohicans.'
	Only book my father ever read.

He kisses her again and again she clings to him.

		LIEUTENANT DISH
	You're getting a workout, you
	and Captain Forrest, your first
	night.

		HAWKEYE
	It isn't always this rough?

		LIEUTENANT DISH
	Oh, no.  We have dull stretches
	every week or so, thank God,
	when there's nothing to do after
	midnight.

		HAWKEYE
	They don't have to be dull.  I
	mean if you and me put our minds
	together...

		LIEUTENANT DISH
	Our minds?

		HAWKEYE
	For a start.  I just have a
	hunch... well, it isn't entirely
	a hunch...

		LIEUTENANT DISH
	You're an attractive man.

		HAWKEYE
	You have a certain modest charm
	yourself.

		LIEUTENANT DISH
	  (continuing her
	  own thoughts)
	But I'm married.

		HAWKEYE
	Something else we have in common.

		LIEUTENANT DISH
	Very happily married.

		HAWKEYE
	Same here.

		LIEUTENANT DISH
	And absolutely determined to be
	faithful to my husband.  Do we
	have that in common, Captain?

		HAWKEYE
	It's a matter of definition.
	Faithful in spirit, yes.

		LIEUTENANT DISH
	I don't make the distinction.
	But the sex urge is a powerful
	force.  In women just as much as
	men.

		HAWKEYE
	Ayuh.

		LIEUTENANT DISH
	You'd think now, with only six
	weeks before they ship me back
	home, it would be easier.  But
	it isn't.

		HAWKEYE
	Of course not.

		LIEUTENANT DISH
	It's terribly hard.  Sometimes the
	temptation is just too much.

		HAWKEYE
	Then why not, as long as it wouldn't
	hurt anybody...?

		LIEUTENANT DISH
	  (not hearing him,
	  just continuing her
	  own thought)
	But you've made me feel strong
	again, Captain.  Hawkeye.
	  (smiling, tears
	  gone, ready to
	  return to work)
	You helped me pull together when
	I needed it.

With a grateful look at him, she goes back inside.  Hawkeye contemplates
the accomplishment she has credited him with, and finds it appalling.

11	INT.  OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

Hawkeye and Duke are working across the table from each other again, this
time inside a man's chest, stopping a hemorrhage and debriding the wound.

		DUKE
	Now that's what I call real
	pretty.  We can close up here
	and go into his belly.

		HAWKEYE
	He can't take much more time on
	the table.

		DUKE
	So we got to cut him fast.  I
	figure from the X-ray it ain't
	just the spleen.  We also got to
	snatch his right kidney.

12	EXT. MASH COMPOUND - MORNING

Wearing fatigues now, Hawkeye and Duke are making their weary way from the
hospital to their tent after a night's work.  There is an announcement
coming over the post-wide public address system, but it doesn't concern
them.

		SARGEANT VOLLMER'S VOICE
	(over P.A.)
	Captain Murrhardt, please report
	to the Colonel's office at the
	earliest opportunity.  Captain
	Murrhardt.

						BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

13	INT. THE SWAMP - MORNING

Ho-Jon throws a match into the oil stove, but it doesn't work.  He looks
into it, strikes another match, and this time it lights up so quickly he
is almost singed by the flame.  Hawkeye and Duke open the door and come
in.  Ho-Jon straightens and bows.

		HO-JON
	Good morning, Captain Pierce
	and Captain Forrest.

		HAWKEYE
	You can cut the bow.

		HO-JON
	I have not understood what you
	means.

		HAWKEYE
	  (demonstrating bow)
	That.  It's out of the act.

He and Duke remove their outer clothing during the ensuing:

		HO-JON
	Because is not democrash?  All
	peoples created equal?

		DUKE
	Hey, you been sneaking some
	reading outside the frigging Bible!

		HO-JON
	I have great interest for America,
	his peoples and his custom.

		DUKE
	Good, because we got a fine old
	American custom we want to teach
	you.  You know what these are?

He gives Ho-Jon two bottles.  The boy looks at the labels.

		HO-JON
	Gin.  I know, yes.
	  (reads other label)
	Dry...
	  (has trouble with
	  the word)
	...vermouth.

14	EXT. MASH COMPOUND - MORNING

Frank walks toward the tent from the direction of the hospital.

						BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

15	INT. THE SWAMP - MORNING

Frank opens the door and is taken aback by the sight of the two bottles on
the table and Ho-Jon filling glasses held by Duke and Hawkeye, who have
climbed into their sleeping bags.  He is so disturbed he fails to shut the
door.

		FRANK
	Is that liquor?

		HAWKEYE
	Finest kind.  We're training
	Ho-Jon to be a bartender.  Join
	us?

		DUKE
	But first will you please kindly
	shut the goddam door?

		FRANK
	I don't drink intoxicants.

		HAWKEYE
	  (to Duke)
	Christ Almighty, I think he
	means it!

		DUKE
	We been had.

		FRANK
	I don't believe it's right for
	you to involve a boy who's not
	seventeen years old yet...

		DUKE
	The door, Frank, the door!
	Where you from anyhow, Alaska?

		FRANK
	  (closing door)
	Wisconsin.

		DUKE
	Same general idea.

Frank proceeds to take off his outer clothing preparatory to retiring.

		HO-JON
	Officer all sleep now, yes?
	And I go wash clothes.

		HAWKEYE
	Right, Ho-Jon.  See you later.

		FRANK
	So long, Ho-Jon.

		DUKE
	You make a mean martini, kid.

Ho-Jon goes out. Duke and Hawkeye settle back to enjoy their drinks but they
both come bolt upright when they see Frank drop to his knees by his cot and
begin to intone the Lord's Prayer.

		FRANK
	Our Father who art in Heaven
	Hallow'd be Thy name.
	Thy kingdom come,
	Thy will be done,
	On earth as it is in Heaven...

Hawkeye and Duke find it hard to believe their eyes and ears.  They never
expected to see a grown man behaving as Frank is now.

	FRANK						HAWKEYE
Give us this day our daily			   You ever caught this
bread, and forgive our			   syndrome before, Duke?

					   glasses)
					   Amen!

		DUKE
	  (singing)
	Onward Christian soldiers...

		DUKE AND HAWKEYE
	  (singing)
	Marching as to war.
	With the cross of Jesus going
	on before.
	Christ our Royal Master, leads
	against the foe.
	Forward into battle...

		DUKE
	  (breaking off
	  singing, points to
	  Frank)
	He ain't finished!

For a moment, before Hawkeye speaks, some of the words Frank is mumbling
come through.

		FRANK
	...And for our young men on the
	field of battle, that they may
	return home to their dear ones...

		HAWKEYE
	Come clean with us, Frank.  Were
	you on this religious kick back
	home, or did you start to crack
	up here on the post?

		FRANK
	  (ignoring him)
	....And for our Supreme Commander
	over here and our Commander-in-
	Chief in Washington.

		DUKE
	How long does the show go on,
	Frank?

Frank turns his head toward Duke while remaining in praying position.

		FRANK
	It gets longer all the time.
	Now I have your soul to pray for,
	and Captain Pierce's.

							TIME LAPSE:

16	INT. HENRY'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY

Sargeant Vollmer is working on some papers at his desk when Hawkeye and
Duke come in.  They pass right by him and head for Henry's door.

		VOLLMER
	Hey!  That's a Colonel's office!

		HAWKEYE
	  (hand on Henry's
	  door)
	Ayuh.  Just who we're looking for.
	  (opens door)
	Henry, you got to do something!

LESLIE exits from Henry's office as they enter.

17	INT. HENRY'S OFFICE - DAY

Henry is at his desk.  Duke and Hawkeye come in and seat themselves in
informal comfort.  Both watch Leslie exit.

		HAWKEYE
	We've stuck it out for a whole
	week now...  Pretty girl.

		DUKE
	We sure don't aim to cause any
	trouble...  Yeah, she seems to
	grow on you.

		HENRY
	You don't aim to cause any
	trouble - But?

		HAWKEYE
	But we strongly suspect something
	will happen to screw up this
	splendid organization of yours
	if you don't get that sky pilot
	out of our tent.

		HENRY
	Your tent?

		DUKE
	Yeah, maybe move that nurse in.
	She don't seem the type to keep
	you awake praying.

		HENRY
	  (pause)
	I have been in this Army a long
	time.  I know just what you guys
	are up to.  But there are limits...

		HAWKEYE
	We'll find out what they are
	when you throw us out.

		HENRY
	That's all the commitment you're
	offering me?
	  (to Duke)
	Or do you have some more
	extragavant gesture of cooperation?

		DUKE
	No, Hawkeye just said it all.

		HAWKEYE
	Except we forgot one other small
	thing.

		DUKE
	What's that?

		HAWKEYE
	The chest-cutter.

		DUKE
	Yeah, that's right.
	  (to Henry)
	You better get us a chest-cutter
	before there's trouble.

		HAWKEYE
	This outfit needs somebody who
	can find his way around the
	pulmonary anatomy when the bases
	are loaded.

		DUKE
	And it's the ninth inning.

		HENRY
	Forget it.  No Mash unit has a
	chest surgeon and we aren't about
	to get one.  Your housing problem
	I'll give some thought to in the
	next couple of weeks.

Radar O'Reilly comes in with "emergency" written all over his expressive
face.  He makes a hand gesture to Henry that could loosely be construed
as a salute.

		HENRY
	Yes, O'Reilly?

		DUKE
	How you, Radar?

		RADAR
	They're running behind in the
	OR, sir, and the Preop Ward is all
	jammed up.  Two choppers and three
	ambulances full.

This is the most serious kind of crisis for the outfit, and Henry's
expression shows it.

		HENRY
	  (to Duke and
	  Hawkeye)
	You boys'll have to go to work
	early.

		DUKE
	You fixing to add overtime to
	a twelve-hour day?  The union
	ain't gonna like it.

		HAWKEYE
	You work those kind of hours, you
	got to have rest.  Which you can't
	get with somebody jabbering away
	on a direct line to heaven.

		HENRY
	  (crisply)
	Major Burns will be out of your
	tent in twenty-four hours.
	  (to Radar)
	Tell them Captain Pierce and
	Captain Forrest are on their way.

Radar goes out.  Duke gets to his feet and Hawkeye makes a preliminary
move toward doing so.

		HAWKEYE
	About that chest-cutter...

		HENRY
	I'll try, d-d-dammit!  You can't
	ask any more than that!

		HAWKEYE
	We don't want any more than
	that.
	  (following Duke
	  out)
	Right now.

							TIME LAPSE:

18	EXT. MASH COMPOUND - DUSK

Hawkeye and Lieutenant Dish are walking close together in an otherwise
deserted area.

		HAWKEYE
	Cold?

He puts an arm around her without waiting for an answer.  She smiles at
him fondly.

		LIEUTENANT DISH
	Even if I weren't.

		HAWKEYE
	Maria...

He kisses her and they cling together, standing outside a tent identified
by a sign:  "OFFICER'S CLUB."

		LIEUTENANT DISH
	Oh, Hawkeye, I don't think I
	could stick it out these next
	few weeks without you.

Hawkeye opens the door of the Officers' Club, looks in.

		HAWKEYE
	Nobody here.

He steps aside to let her precede him in.  There is nothing inside except
a pool table.  She hesitates.  He takes her in his arms again, this time
pressing his hands against the seat of her fatigue pants.

		LIEUTENANT DISH
	You understand why I still can't...

Ho-Jon appears in his line of vision, not hers.

		HO-JON
	Captain Pierces...

Hawkeye lets go of her, and they try to look like innocent strollers.

		HAWKEYE
	Hi, Ho-Jon.  How they goin'?

		HO-JON
	Finest kind.  Captain Forrests
	say you better haul ass home quick.
	We got new chest-cutter in our tent.

						BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

19	EXT. THE SWAMP - DUSK

The wooden front of the tent has a new sign identifying it as "THE SWAMP."

20	INT. THE SWAMP - DUSK

First we see Hawkeye sitting on his cot, looking across the tent at the
newcomer.  Attached to the canvas wall behind him is a photograph of his
wife and two sons, aged four and two.  Next we turn our attention to Duke
on the adjoining cot (formerly Frank's).  He also has a family picture on
display: his wife, two-year-old daughter and an infant.  Then we get our
first glimpse of TRAPPER JOHN, their new tentmate, about 30, tall and very
thin, his head pretty well hidden inside the hood of a parka.  He is using
cellophane tape to install one of the popular nude photos of the day (such
as the one of Marilyn Monroe that circulated so widely in the early
1950's).  Completing the group is Ho-Jon, who sits on the floor, silently
taking in everything that is done or said.

Finished with his decorating effort, Trapper reaches into the depths of his
parka to produce a can of beer.  He digs into the other side, finds an
opener and opens the beer.  Then his head goes back inside the parka along
with the can as he takes a swig from it.

		DUKE
	  (to Hawkeye)
	Now I got you for a witness, I'm
	going to try again.  So far all I
	dragged out of him is he's from
	Bahston and he's only been in the
	Army two months.
	  (to Trapper)
	Where were you when they drafted
	you?

		TRAPPER
	Home.

		DUKE
	I mean, what were you doing?
	Were you a resident or on a staff
	someplace?

		TRAPPER
	That's right.

		DUKE
	Where?

		TRAPPER
	Hospital.

		DUKE
	Which hospital?

		TRAPPER
	Back home.

		DUKE
	Is there any reason why we
	shouldn't know the name of it?

		TRAPPER
	No.
	  (a long swig of beer)
	Or why you should.

		HAWKEYE
	  (to Duke)
	I think I've seen this nut
	somewhere.
	  (to Trapper)
	Haven't I?

		TRAPPER
	If you don't know what you've
	seen, why should I?

Hawkeye is unsatisfied.  He keeps staring at Trapper, sure he's seen him
before.

		DUKE
	  (to Trapper)
	You ready to switch to a little
	tonic we generally take us about
	this time?  Ho-Jon...

Ho-Jon goes to the table and takes a few ice cubes from a hospital ice-bag,
puts them into the pitcher along with gin and a dash of vermouth.

		TRAPPER
	Don't you use olives?

		DUKE
	Where you think you are, boy?
	They probably never seen a olive
	in this country.

Ho-Jon pours three water-glasses full of martini and starts to distribute
them.

		HAWKEYE
	  (to Trapper)
	That's the front up the road a
	few miles.  We have to get by
	without some of the comforts of
	home.

		TRAPPER
	I like an olive.

He reaches into his parka, comes up with a bottle of olives, takes one out
and puts it into the martini Ho-Jon serves him.  Then, as Hawkeye and Duke
gape at him, he offers them the bottle.

							TIME LAPSE:

21	INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY

There are two operations going on, one of them being a simple procedure
requiring one surgeon and one nurse.  The other by contrast is a very
special event.  Trapper is operating, assisted by another surgeon, a
couple of nurses, a corpsman, and the anesthesiologist, UGLY JOHN BLACK.
Beside these actual participants almost all the nurses and doctors from
both shifts, including Duke, Hawkeye (with Lieutenant Dish), Frank and
Henry, are in a circle around the operating table as spectators.

Trapper's job is repairing a lacerated pulmonary artery, or some other
delicate piece of surgery close to the heart and involving a large chest
incision.  We see enough of the process to observe that it is gory and
deep inside a critical area, but necessarily it is the reactions of the
people watching, especially Duke and Hawkeye, that tell us how tricky an
operation it is and how expertly Trapper is handling it.

The sequence is silent except for incidental operating room noises.  Even
Trapper's occasional terse instructions to his assistants and his brief
exchange with Ugly John are spoken too low for us to hear.  There are four
stages to the action:

1.  The beginning of the operation before an attentive audience, drawn by
their interest in the new man and by the fact that this is a surgical
procedure they have never dared to attempt.

2.  Limited approval and professional respect for the assurance with which
Trapper plots his incision and starts working his way to his destination.

3.  Mounting tension as the crucial stage is reached.  The suspense reaches
its crest during the few moments when Trapper is doing the actual mending
job to which all the preliminaries have led.  The faces of his colleagues
express anxiety and hope that he can accomplish what he set out to do, and
accomplish it quickly enough to permit the patient to survive.  Henry, not
certain of his own judgement, looks to Duke for confirmation, and Duke
nods to indicate he thinks Trapper has the situation under control.

4.  The tension breaks as Trapper finishes the job to his satisfaction
and begins, along with his assistant surgeon, to close up.  Henry's smile
of relief is unsure and only tentative until he catches Hawkeye's signal
that the job has been done to perfection.

							TIME LAPSE:

22	EXT. MASH COMPOUND - DAY

Trapper, Hawkeye and Duke emerge from the hospital in fatigues.  Some
enlisted men are tossing a football around.  One of them makes a wild
throw and the ball rolls to a stop at Trapper's feet.  He stops to look
at it and the other two halt with him.  Then very slowly, Trapper leans
over and picks up the ball, waving Hawkeye downfield.

Hawkeye complies unquestioningly and when he is about thirty yards away,
Trapper whips a perfect pass into his arms.  Hawkeye just stands where he
is, holding the ball, oblivious of the enlisted men who want it back, as
Trapper and Duke continue toward him.  Revelation jolts him with
apocalyptic force.

		HAWKEYE
	Jesus to Jesus and eight hands
	around!  Duke, did I ever tell
	you how I beat Dartmouth by
	intercepting a pass?

		DUKE
	Sixteen times.

		HAWKEYE
	We didn't have a chance, little
	Androscoggin College against the
	Big Green, but there was this
	blizzard and we held then nothing-
	nothing till the last twenty seconds.
	Then this great passer of theirs
	let one go, snow and all...

		TRAPPER
	Lucky you didn't have your mouth
	open or it would have gone down
	your throat.

		HAWKEYE
	He's Trapper John!  Only man in
	history who ever found fulfillment
	in the ladies' can of a Boston and
	Maine Railroad car!  When the
	Conductor caught him in there with
	his Winter Carnival date, she
	screamed:  'He trapped me!'  What
	have you been doing since those
	days, Trapper?

		DUKE
	What does he have to do?  A score
	like that, a man could just live
	on his reputation.

The enlisted men, increasingly concerned about their football, are
muttering mutinously to each other.  Hawkeye is too carried away about
Trapper's identity to notice this till Trapper calls it to his
attention.

		TRAPPER
	  (to Hawkeye)
	Ball.

Hawkeye looks at the football and at the enlisted men, and, finally
getting the point, throws it back to them.

		TRAPPER
	  (relieved to find
	  another subject)
	What gives over there?

They look across the compound to the Shower Tent, behind which an Army
truck full of GIs has just pulled up.  While Hawkeye and Duke explain
what's going on to Trapper, and the three of them move in for a closer
look, we see the visiting GIs drop one by one from the rear of the truck,
pay their admission fees and take their places in the line leading up to
the strategically placed peep hole in the rear corner of the tent.

		DUKE
	Must be Painlees Pole Day in
	the Shower Tent.

		HAWKEYE
	  (to Trapper)
	You met him.  Walt Waldowski, the
	Dental Officer.

		DUKE
	Nice guy, for an enamel surgeon.

		TRAPPER
	What are they peeking at?
	Captain Waldowski in the shower?

		HAWKEYE
	Part of him.  Painless is the
	owner and operator of the Pride
	of Hamtrack.  That's where he
	comes from...Hamtrack, Michigan.

		DUKE
	Best equipped dentist in the whole
	goddam Army.  Care to have a look,
	a man with your background?

		HAWKEYE
	Way we hear it, the Pride is
	supposed to have run up the highest
	lifetime batting average ever
	recorded in Wayne County.

23	EXT. SHOWER TENT - DAY

Corporal Judson from Mississippi takes his turn at the peephole.  His
speech is that of the rural southern black.

		JUDSON
	Ah'd purely love to see it angry.

							TIME LAPSE:

24	INT. OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

Hawkeye and Duke are working on a patient about whose chances their faces
reveal extreme pessimism.  The nurse in attendance is Leslie.  Hawkeye
takes the patient's blood pressure and frowns at the reading.

		HAWKEYE
	This kid looks like a loser.
	Maybe we better get the bead-
	jiggler to put in a fix.

		DUKE
	  (to Leslie)
	Call Dago Red.

							TIME LAPSE:

25	INT. OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

Without interfering with the administration of blood and other medical
measures, Dago Red is just finishing giving last rites to the patient.

		DAGO RED
	...May God remit unto thee the
	pains of the present and future
	life, open to thee the gates of
	heaven, and bring thee to
	everlasting life.
	  (makes the sign
	  of the Cross)
	May Almighty God bless thee,
	Father, Son and Holy Ghost.

		LESLIE
	  (taking patient's
	  pulse)
	Duke...

She wants him to feel it and he does, reacting excitedly.

		DUKE
	Slowing down!

Hawkeye meanwhile is checking blood pressure again.

		HAWKEYE
	Going up.  Nice work, Red.

							TIME LAPSE:

26	INT. THE SWAMP - DAY

Dago Red is the cocktail guest of the three Swampmen.  Ho-Jon sits in
his usual place on the floor, following everything that's said and
refilling martini glasses wherever needed.

		DAGO RED
	There's sort of a built-in
	prayer for the sick man to get
	well, but of course that's not
	the basic intention.

		HAWKEYE
	I don't care about the intention.
	I just know your Cross Action is
	a plus on our side.  I've seen it
	come through four times.

		DUKE
	And you've had a natural four
	times in a row in a crap game.
	  Right?  Does that mean...?

		HAWKEYE
	Not without lots of praying and
	kissing the dice.
	  (to Dago Red)
	It's a different ritual but it
	works the same.

		DUKE
	What do you think, Trapper?

		TRAPPER
	Me?  I was raised a mackerel-
	snapper...

Dago Red gives him a quick, inent look, which Hawkeye notes.

		TRAPPER
	...But I turned in my knee pads.

		HAWKEYE
	Ho-Jon, give the Father some
	more martini.

		DAGO RED
	Just a taste, Ho-Jon.
	  (to the group)
	I'd better get to the point...
	what I came here for today.

		DUKE
	You came because we asked you,
	for a drink.

		HAWKEYE
	We wanted to tell you how you
	were helping us with your fixes.

		DAGO RED
	Well, sure, but I'm also worried
	about Walt Waldowski - Painless.
	His poker players got in an
	argument and asked him for a
	ruling, and he said what difference
	did it make, it was just a card
	game.

It's obvious from the shocked reactions of the Swampmen that the priest
couldn't have reported a more ominous symptom.

		HAWKEYE
	I guess I'm getting a tootheache
	I better have looked at.

						BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

27	INT. DENTAL CLINIC - DAY

There is no activity around the dental chair, but the nonstop poker game
is thriving as Hawkeye enters, carrying a bottle in a paper bag.  The
players are evenly divided between officers (UGLY JOHN, MURRHARDT and a
visiting HELICOPTER PILOT) and enlisted men (VOLLMER, RADAR and JUDSON).

		UGLY JOHN
	Take a seat, Hawk.  We can use
	a fresh pigeon.

		HAWKEYE
	Got to see the man about a
	tooth.  Where is he?

		RADAR
	  (to Vollmer)
	Call.  With a pair of kings.
	  (to Hawkeye, pointing
	  to smaller tent
	  attached)
	Inside.

Hawkeye goes on into Painless' private quarters.

		VOLLMER
	  (indignantly, to
	  Radar)
	How can you call with one lousy
	pair?  Ought to be a house rule
	against mind reading.

						BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

28	INT. PAINLESS' TENT - DAY

Painless is lying on his back on the cot, staring blankly at the ceiling.
Hawkeye has poured drinks from his bottle and is sipping his, but
Painless' remains untouched.

		PAINLESS
	If a man isn't a man anymore,
	what's he got left to live for?

		HAWKEYE
	Tell me the whole story, Walt.

		PAINLESS
	There's this native braod works
	in the laundry.  I don't know if
	you've noticed.

		HAWKEYE
	There's only one worth noticing.

		PAINLESS
	You noticed.  I wasn't going to
	fool around over here.  I've
	got these three girls I'm engaged
	to back home...

He indicates three photographs of young women, displayed with equal
prominence.  Any one of them could make Miss America.

		PAINLESS
	But I had this feeling I ought to
	make the effort.  To test myself.
	And I flunked.

		HAWKEYE
	What did you have to test, for
	God's sake...the dental Don Juan
	of Detroit?

		PAINLESS
	Don Juanism is just a cover...
	I've been reading up on it.
	  (emotionally overcome,
	  turning away)
	I'm a fake, I'm a fraud, I've been
	living a lie!

Moved by the intensity of his self-denunciation, Hawkeye bends down
close to Painless, puts a comforting hand on his shoulder.

		HAWKEYE
	Painless, you mustn't talk that
	way.  It's a lot of crap.  Cover
	for what?

		PAINLESS
	Homosexuality.

Hawkeye straightens abruptly, his hand rising from Painless' shoulder
as from a hot stove.

		PAINLESS
	Now I know that's been my problem
	since I was a kid.  But it only
	caught up to me last night.

		HAWKEYE
	You've been drawn to other males?
	Since you were a kid?

		PAINLESS
	No, never in the slightest.

		HAWKEYE
	Just in dreams?

		PAINLESS
	Or in dreams either.  I repressed
	it completely.  Classic pattern
	of inhibition.

		HAWKEYE
	That's what you've been doing
	all these years with every dame
	you could lay your hands on?
	Repressing your real self?

		PAINLESS
	But it's all over now, and I
	can't face it.  Imagine if you
	found out you were one, you
	wouldn't like breaking the news
	to your wife.  Well, I got the
	same problem multiplied.

		HAWKEYE
	You don't have any problem.  You've
	got thirty good years ahead of you,
	easy.  Maybe you'll have to cut
	down as you grow older, get along
	with just two fiancees, but...

		PAINLESS
	No, one thing I finally know for
	sure, I'll never function with a
	woman again.

							TIME LAPSE:

29	INT. THE SWAMP - NIGHT

Hawkeye is reporting to Duke and Trapper.  Murrhardt and Bandini are
there, as well as Ho-Jon.

		HAWKEYE
	There ought to be a law against
	dentists reading.  Matter of
	fact, I thought there was.
	Anyway, this is an obsession.
	He can't be persuaded out of it.

		HO-JON
	  (appearing in
	  doorway)
	He's comin' this-a-way!  The
	jaw-breaker!

		DUKE
	Y'all just act natural.

		HAWKEYE
	Get out the scotch, Ho-Jon.
	  (to the others)
	Don't mention the sex thing
	unless he brings it up.

A perfunctory knock on the door is immediately followed by the entrance
of Painless.

		DUKE
	How you, Walt?  We was just fixing
	to have a nightcap.

		TRAPPER
	  (to Ho-Jon)
	Pour one for Painless.

Ho-Jon serves drinks all around.  There is a silence as each of the hosts
tries to think of a conversational opening.

		PAINLESS
	I thought you guys ought to know.
	I'm going to commit suicide.

This leads to another silence, broken by Trapper, who doesn't go so far
as to stand up but leans way out from his sack to grasp the dentist by
the hand.

		TRAPPER
	Miss you, Walt.

		DUKE
	He said it for us all, Walt.

		BANDIDI
	How about leaving me your record
	player?

		HAWKEYE
	How do you figure to go?  Forty-
	five between the eyes?

		DUKE
	Powerful sloppy.

		MURRHARDT
	Reliable though.

		PAINLESS
	That's really what I came here
	for.  See what you guys recommend.

		HAWKEYE
	  (as in a medical
	  consultation)
	Well, I'm sure my colleagues will
	agree there are a number of
	dependable measures for extinguishing
	the vital forces.

		TRAPPER
	Black capsule.

		HAWKEYE
	The black capsule.  Finest kind.
	Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.

		PAINLESS
	What is it?

		TRAPPER
	Easy, pleasant, never-miss ride.

		HAWKEYE
	In the direction you want to go.

		PAINLESS
	You guys got any black capsules?

		DUKE
	For a buddy we got whatever it
	takes to stamp out the last spark
	of life.

							TIME LAPSE:

30	INT. DAGO RED'S TENT - DAY

The priest is sitting at his desk reading his breviary when Hawkeye and
Trapper enter.  Trapper goes over to Red's beer supply, opens it and
distributes three cans while Hawkeye greets their host.

		HAWKEYE
	How they goin', Losing Preacher?
	What do you hear from the Pope?

		DAGO RED
	You talked to Walt?

		HAWKEYE
	He's parted his moorings.

		TRAPPER
	We're throwing him a Last Supper.
	We came to invite you.

		HAWKEYE
	The Painless Pole plans to cross
	the Great Divide tonight and we
	need your help to straighten him
	out.

		DAGO RED
	What do you want me to do?

		HAWKEYE
	Put in one of your fixes.  Walt
	knows he's loused himself with the
	Church, but it's part of our plan
	to make him think he has the keys
	to the kingdom.  Which he will
	think if you grease the skids
	for him.

		DAGO RED
	I don't think I can give absolution
	to a man who's about to commit
	suicide.  It's a mortal sin.

		HAWKEYE
	What is, Red, the intention or
	the act?

		DAGO RED
	  (confused)
	I believe it takes both.  I'd
	have to look it up.

		HAWKEYE
	Just use common sense.  Your job
	is preventing sin, and the way to
	do that is give him your best
	Cross Action.

		TRAPPER
	Or you can let him knock himself
	out.  You personally'd be sending
	him to his grave.

		HAWKEYE
	An eternal damnation.

		DAGO RED
	  (feeling cornered)
	I don't know.  I'm not sure what
	the Military Vicar's office would
	think...

		TRAPPER
	They sure as hell won't hear
	about it from us.

							TIME LAPSE:

31	INT. DENTAL CLINIC - NIGHT

The poker table, and dental chair have been removed to make room for two
long tables from the Mess Hall.  At these a sumptuous, candle-lit, stag
banquet is coming to an end.  The guests are doctors, administrative
officers, chopper pilots and enlisted men.  Duke is on his feet, raising
a glass of champagne in a toast.  (All our male cast except Henry and
Frank)

		DUKE
	Y'all come here to say a final
	goodbye to our old friend Walt.
	But maybe it ain't so final.
	Maybe he's just going on ahead
	into the Unknown to do a little
	recon job for us all.

During this tribute the guests rise, their eyes on the guest of honor, who
sits with his food untouched, a vacant expression on his face.  When Duke
has finished and everyone has drunk the toast, they applaud and sit down
again.  Trapper raps for attention and indicates Hawkeye, who rises.

		HAWKEYE
	I just got this one thing to say.
	Nobody ordered Walt to take on this
	mission.  He volunteered, for
	certain death.  That's what we
	award our highest medal for.  That's
	what being a soldier is all about.

Except for Painless himself, the gathering is deeply moved by this thought,
some of them to the point of tears.  Again Trapper restores order.

		TRAPPER
	Only one man here can add anything
	to that.

He looks to Dago Red, who stands up, dressed for the first time in the
priestly vestments he wears for Sunday Mass.  He walks to where Painless
sits and there begins the viaticum (holy communion for those in danger of
death).

		DAGO RED
	Receive, my brother, this food
	for your journey...

A coffin, borne into the room by two enlisted men while Red is still
speaking, is lined with blankets, equipped with a pillow for comfortable
reclining prior to the onset of death, and furnished with momentos of
Painless' earthly career: two fresh decks of cards, a box of poker chips,
a fifth of scotch, some basic dental instruments and the photographs of
his three fiancees.  It is set down on the floor next to Painless, who
regards it with the first show of interest he has manifested during the
proceedings.

		DAGO RED
	  (bestowing the
	  sacred host)
	...The body of our Lord Jesus
	Christ, that He may guard you from
	the wicked enemy and lead you into
	everlasting life.  Amen.

Red is making the sign of the Cross when Painless' curiousity asserts
itself.

		PAINLESS
	What the hell's that?

		TRAPPER
	Coffin.  Yours.

		PAINLESS
	I'm not even dead yet.

		HAWKEYE
	You're a pretty heavy guy to lug
	around.  Be a hell of a lot more
	convenient for everybody if you got
	into the box as soon as you've
	taken the capsule.

He produces and opens a small box, inside which, surrounded by pure white
cotton, a black capsule is displayed like a rare jewel.  Dago Red,
meanwhile, preferring not to know what happens from here on, makes his
way out.

		PAINLESS
	  (scrutinizing the
	  capsule)
	How do you take it?

		DUKE
	  (appearing at his
	  side with tumbler
	  of whiskey)
	With whiskey.  A good swallow
	first and a big one afterwards.
	Speeds it into the bloodstream.

Painless takes the tumbler from him with one hand, the capsule with the
other.  He downs a good-sized swig of whiskey, then, with the capsule in
front of his face, hesitates.

		PAINLESS
	You guys sure this'll do the job?

		DUKE
	We wouldn't give you nothing but
	the best.

		TRAPPER
	We stand behind all our work.

		HAWKEYE
	You want it straight?  Medical
	history records no instance of
	anyone taking this particular
	prescription and surviving.

		PAINLESS
	Here goes nothing.

He pops the capsule into his mouth and washes it down with a large drink
of whiskey.  Hawkeye gestures to the waiting coffin.  Painless gets up
and lowers himself into it.

		PAINLESS
	How much time do I have?

		HAWKEYE
	Just about enough to say goodbye
	to everybody.
	  (announcing)
	Line up over here, men, if you
	want to pay your last respects.
	Keep moving and file on out when
	you're through.

		PAINLESS
	I wonder, if Red's fix swings it
	for me, what's heaven really like?

		TRAPPER
	It's a bedroom where a man is
	always at his peak and doesn't
	have to take any time outs.

		HAWKEYE
	And all the angels are built like
	Lieutenant Dish.

The Last Supper guests are filing by the coffin, bending low to shake
Painless' hand and murmur words of farewell.

		DUKE
	Drink up, Walt.  One for the
	glory road.

He holds the glass to Painless' lips, helps him down the rest of the
whiskey.

							TIME LAPSE:

32	INT. POSTOP WARD - NIGHT

Hawkeye finishes checking a patient, looks to doorway and sees
lieutenant Dish standing there.  He crosses to join her.

		HAWKEYE
	Thanks for coming, Maria.
	  (takes her arm
	  and leads her
	  through exit)
	Sorry it had to be so late.

33	EXT. MASH COMPOUND - NIGHT

Hawkeye and Lieutenant Dish walk from the Postop Ward.

		LIEUTENANT DISH
	I couldn't have slept tonight
	anyhow.

		HAWKEYE
	You're leaving tomorrow?

		LIEUTENANT DISH
	In less than twelve hours I'll
	be on my way.

		HAWKEYE
	That's when the real strain
	starts.  Three weeks on a
	troopship.
	  (embraces her)
	Poor baby.

		LIEUTENANT DISH
	  (kissing him)
	Dear, sweet Hawkeye.

		HAWKEYE
	Though I guess who it'll really
	be rough on is your husband.

		LIEUTENANT DISH
	You're on his side all of the sudden?

		HAWKEYE
	A man would be more considerate.
	He wouldn't come home to his wife
	a nervous wreck.

		LIEUTENANT DISH
	How would he avoid it...as if I
	needed to ask?

		HAWKEYE
	It could be a purely impersonal
	thing.  What matters is the
	therapeutic value of relieving
	your tensions.

		LIEUTENANT DISH
	You should have been a marriage
	counselor.
	  (drawing his head
	  closer to hers)
	But I'll show you what's wrong
	with your theory.

They kiss passionately.  Dish is shaken by it and that shows in her voice
when she continues making her point.

		LIEUTENANT DISH
	Do you think anything between us
	could be impersonal?  Or pure?
	You better forget logic, because
	you're proving why I shouldn't go
	to bed with you.

		HAWKEYE
	  (after a moment of
	  massive internal
	  struggle)
	I didn't mean with me.

It takes a couple of seconds for what he has said to penetrate her
conciousness.  She looks at him incredulously.

		LIEUTENANT DISH
	You're asking for somebody else?

		HAWKEYE
	It happens to be a matter of
	life and death.

		LIEUTENANT DISH
	A man is going to die if he doesn't
	have my fair young body?

		HAWKEYE
	Precisely, Maria.  Tonight you
	have the same privilege that comes
	on rare occasions to the chief
	executive of some state or nation...
	the privilege of restoring life,
	by one tender act of mercy, to a
	doomed fellow creature.

While he is speaking, a blue light goes on in a tent in the background.
As they turn to see what is going on, four men carrying a heavy box
approach the tent.

34	EXT. BLUE-LIT TENT - NIGHT (OFFICER'S CLUB)

At closer range the box is revealed to be Painless' coffin with the
departed dentist inside it.  The four men who carry it into the tent
are Radar, Judson, Boone and Seidman.  This tent doesn't have a wooden
door like the Swamp, just a flap.

						BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

35	EXT. BLUE-LIT TENT - NIGHT

The four enlisted men carry the coffin, empty, out of the tent.  Then
Hawkeye and Dish appear, moving slowly toward the tent as he continues
to break down her resistance.

		HAWKEYE
	He should come to now for a while,
	but he's got so much dope in him
	by tomorrow he won't know fact
	from fantasy.

		LIEUTENANT DISH
	You think he won't.

		HAWKEYE
	What do you care?  You'll be on
	your way to Japan.

		LIEUTENANT DISH
	I'm fond of Painless, and I'd
	feel terrible if anything happened
	to him...

		HAWKEYE
	It's your decision, Maria.  I
	don't want to high-pressure you.

		LIEUTENANT DISH
	I'd be crazy to think my virtue,
	such as it is, was more important
	than his life...

		HAWKEYE
	In fact I'd rather not try to
	influence you at all.
	  (opening tent flap)
	Let's just go in and take a look,
	and then you think it through for
	yourself.

36	INT. BLUE-LIT TENT - NIGHT

The tent has been fixed up with all the resources at their disposal -
cushions, parachute cloth, mirrors and little touches of elegance
gathered from all over the post - to resemble a luxurious bedroom on the
home front.  Lying in bed (the pool table) between clean, inviting sheets
is Painless.  The boys have undressed him as we can see by his bare
shoulders.  Hawkeye takes Dish by the hand and leads her to the side of
the bed.

		HAWKEYE
	One last look at him...
	  (raises sheet,
	  uncovering Painless
	  to the knees)
	...still alive...
	  (slips raised sheet
	  into Dish's grasp)
	...the whole man.

Dish's eyes pop at what she sees.  So astounded is she that she doesn't
notice Hawkeye has given her the sheet and made off.

		LIEUTENANT DISH
	My God, Hawkeye, I never realized...
	I never even dreamed...
	  (becoming aware he's
	  no longer at her side)
	Hawkeye!  Hawk...

She finds he's disappeared altogether.  She can't resist turning her gaze
back to the uncovered Painless.  Then she drops the sheet.

37	EXT. BLUE-LIT TENT - NIGHT

The tent flap drops into place, continuing the movement of the sheet.
Our attention is drawn up the front of the tent to its peak, which
points firmly upwards.

							TIME LAPSE:

38	EXT. THE SWAMP - MORNING

There is the SOUND of a HELICOPTER overhead.  Hawkeye emerges from the
tent to look at it, verifying that it is coming from the peaceful south
rather than the embattled north.  Then he sees Lieutentant Dish coming
out of her tent, wearing her Army uniform and followed by one of the
enlisted men carrying her bags.  Hawkeye waves goodbye but Dish doesn't
see him.  Her face, seen up close, has a serene, faraway look, neither
happy nor unhappy, but enriched by experience.

Hawkeye is not distressed by her failure to acknowledge him; he
understands it's a question of preoccupation and not a deliberate snub.
He starts across the compound to the Mess Hall, noting that the
helicopter is descending to land on the far side of the hospital.

39	EXT. LANDING AREA OUTSIDE 4077TH MASH - MORNING

There is a small welcoming party on hand, headed by Henry himself, to
greet the passenger arriving in the helicopter.  When it lands the door
is opened and HOT LIPS (as she will soon be known) gets out smartly,
which is the way she does everything.  Her official name is Major Margaret
Houlihan and she is tallish, willowish, blondish, fortyish, prettyish.
She and Henry exchange salutes and then shake hands.  The others in the
greeting party are out of the habit of saluting, and have to be reminded
by a stern look from their Commanding Officer.

As Henry and Hot Lips, followed by the others, head for the hospital
entrance, Lieutenant Dish appears with the enlisted man behind her.  She
gets into the helicopter and he lifts her bags in after her.  A moment
later the chopper is airborne again.

40	INT. MESS HALL - DAY

One of the first people Hawkeye sees in the officer's section is Painless,
who is eating an enormous breakfast with great gusto.

		HAWKEYE
	Morning Painless.  How they
	goin'?

		PAINLESS
	Big day.  Two jaws to rebuild.

41	INT.  POSTOP WARD - DAY

Frank is listening gravely to a wounded soldier's heartbeat through a
stethoscope.  Standing by awaiting orders is Private Boone.  Frank has a
disturbed reaction to the lack of vital signs from the patient.

		FRANK
	  (to Boone)
	Get me one c.c. of adrenalin
	and a cardiac needle.

		BOONE
	What's a...?

		FRANK
	Never mind questions.  Get them!

As Boone dashes off with no comprehension of the errand he is supposed
to perform, Trapper, a couple of beds away, in the soiled fatigues he
wears on nonoperating room duty, can see and hear what is going on.
While he watches, Frank checks the patient further and establishes that
he is dead.  With a disappointed sigh, he drops the man's lifeless arm
and throws the bedcovers back over him up to his neck.

42	INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY

Henry is showing Hot Lips through the hospital and introducing her to
personnel.  At the moment he is presenting Knocko.

		HENRY
	Captain Williams, Major.
	  (to Knocko)
	Major Houlihan is our new Chief
	Nurse.

Knocko holds out her hand in friendly greeting, and is startled to find
Hot Lips expects a salute instead.

43	INT. POSTOP WARD - DAY

Trapper, having observed Frank's recognition of the fact his patient is
dead, is unprepared for what the Major does when Boone comes running back
with a syringe, a small vial and an ordinary hypodermic needle.

		BOONE
	  (anxiously)
	This what you wanted, Major?

		FRANK
	  (looking at vial)
	No, you idiot.  I said adrenalin.
	And a cardiac needle.

He turns back to the patient and goes all over again through the same
checking process he followed before.

		BOONE
	  (desperately)
	I'll ask a nurse!

		FRANK
	It's too late.  You killed him,
	Boone.

A ghastly look appears on Boone's face.  He tries to say something, can't
get it out, and bursts into tears instead.  Then additionally ashamed of
himself for this weakness, he runs out.  Frank, deciding not to discipline
the boy for the display of unsoldierly conduct, is proceeding about his
business when Trapper accosts him.

		TRAPPER
	You got a moment, Frank?

He indicates the Utility Room, which leads off the Operating Room and the
Postop Ward.  When Frank assents, Trapper opens the door and ushers him in.

44	INT. UTILITY ROOM - DAY

It's a small room containing, among other items, a table with a pot of
coffee and cups which are available to medical personnel at all hours.

		TRAPPER
	You all through work for the day?

		FRANK
	Yes, I am.  Why do you want to
	know?

		TRAPPER
	Make sure you got time to sleep
	this off.

He puts his whole hundred and thirty pounds behind a right uppercut that
lands squarely on Frank's jaw.  At the same instant the door from the
Operating Room opens, and Henry gallantly makes way for Hot Lips to
precede him.

		HENRY
	This is the...

Frank drops to the floor, momentarily knocked out.

		HENRY
	T-Trapper!...C-C-Captain McIntyre
	...what the hell...?

		HOT LIPS
	  (staring at Trapper
	  incredulously)
	That's a captain?

Frank is coming to and could probably get back into the fight by a count
of eight if he had any desire to.

		HENRY
	  (to Trapper)
	What's going on?  Who started
	this?

		TRAPPER
	You mean who hit who?

		HENRY
	Yes, that's what I mean.

		TRAPPER
	I did.  First and only blow.
	So far.

		FRANK
	  (getting up)
	He wouldn't have touched me if
	I'd had my guard up.  Let us
	settle this between ourselves,
	Colonel.  Alone.

		HENRY
	What do you think I'm running, an
	English boarding school?  McIntyre,
	you're under arrest.  Confine
	yourself to quarters, pending an
	investigation.

		TRAPPER
	If you say so, Henry.  But
	remember my claustrophobia.

		HENRY
	  (to Hot Lips)
	I deeply regret this unfortunate
	incident.  We try to remember
	we're a military organization.

		HOT LIPS
	I certainly would have thought so.

							TIME LAPSE:

45	INT. THE SWAMP - NIGHT

Henry is standing indignantly over Trapper, who is sipping a beer in his
sleeping bag.  Duke, Hawkeye and Ho-Jon are witnesses to the encounter.

		HENRY
	  (yelling)
	What's wrong with you?

		TRAPPER
	I don't know.  I must have lost
	my punch.  I didn't think the
	son-of-a-bitch would get up.

		HAWKEYE
	Stop acting like a colonel, Henry.
	You know Trapper wouldn't sock
	him without a good reason.

		HENRY
	There's no reason good enough
	for one medical officer to strike
	another.

		DUKE
	That there Frank Burns is a
	menace.  Whenever a patient
	croaks on him it's either God's
	will or somebody else's fault.

		HAWKEYE
	This time he did it to a kid who's
	simple enough to believe him.  Why
	don't you dump the mother, Henry?
	He creates more work than he gets
	done.

		HENRY
	I should fire him because he got
	in the way of Trapper's fist?  No.
	I've put up with a lot from you
	guys, but now I finally have to take
	disciplinary action.

		HAWKEYE
	Christ.  All of a sudden it's
	West Point.

		DUKE
	What are you going to do with him?

		HENRY
	Well...
	  (to Trapper)
	I was going to name you Chief
	Surgeon...
	  (to Hawkeye)
	To consult on both shifts, yours
	and Frank's.

		DUKE
	Hey, that's great, Henry!  Good
	thinking!

		HAWKEYE
	First decent idea you've had in a
	month.

		HENRY
	Now I'll have to wait at least a
	week.  If I announced it tomorrow,
	after what our new Chief Nurse saw
	this afternoon, they'd hear her
	yelling from Seoul to Washington.

							TIME LAPSE:

46	INT. MESS HALL - DAY

Hot Lip's handsome face is relaxed into her most charming smile as she
approaches Hawkeye at the table where he sits by himself having a late
breakfast after a long night's work.  Hawkeye (like Trapper and Duke)
no longer makes any attempt at a proper military appearance.

		HOT LIPS
	Captain Pierce, would I be
	imposing...?

		HAWKEYE
	Honey, nobody as pretty as you
	could ever impose...please sit
	down.  Coffee?

He offers her some from the pot beside him, and she holds out a cup while
he pours it.

		HOT LIPS
	Captain, I've been observing the
	nurses on your shift.  But naturally
	your own opinion is more informed
	than mine.

		HAWKEYE
	I'm glad you feel that way, Major,
	because you see it's a team effort...
	doctors, nurses, enlisted men...
	and I feel responsible for my whole
	team, and I want you to know I'm
	satisfied with them.

		HOT LIPS
	All of them?

		HAWKEYE
	That's right.  We work well
	together.

		HOT LIPS
	Major Burns is far from satisfied.

		HAWKEYE
	That don't surprise me.  If you're
	a good observer, you must have
	observed by now that Frank Burns is
	a jerk.

		HOT LIPS
	On the contrary, I've observed he's
	not only a good technical surgeon,
	he's a good military surgeon.  And
	that includes how a man dresses and
	how he bears himself and his sense
	of what it means to be an officer
	in the United States Army.

		HAWKEYE
	And his track record, that don't
	count?  Look, honey, when you watch
	the two shifts try to notice which
	one does the most work with the
	least fuss.

		HOT LIPS
	I've noticed that both nurses and
	enlisted men address you as 'Hawkeye.'

		HAWKEYE
	It's my name.  Maybe that sounds
	silly to you but...

		HOT LIPS
	That kind of familiarity is
	inconsistent with maximum efficiency
	in a military organization.

		HAWKEYE
	Okay, Major, honey.
	  (pushes back his
	  chair)
	I'm going to have a couple shots
	scotch and go to bed.  I'd normally
	ask you to join me but obviously
	you're a female version of the
	routine Regular Army clown.  And
	that turns me off, so just leave
	my outfit alone and we'll get along
	fine.
	  (stands up to go)
	See you around the campus.

		HOT LIPS
	  (icily)
	I wonder how a degenerated person
	like you could have reached a
	position of responsibility in the
	Army Medical Corps.

		HAWKEYE
	Sister, if I knew the answer to
	that I sure as hell wouldn't be
	here.

							TIME LAPSE:

47	EXT./INT. MESS HALL - DAY (SNOW ON GROUND)

People are going in and out of the Mess Hall, when an announcement
comes over the public address system.

		VOLLMER'S VOICE
	  (over P.A. system)
	Attention, everybody.  I have an
	announcement.  'Effective today,
	Thirteen April, Captain John S.
	McIntyre, U.S. Army Reserve, is
	appointed Chief Surgeon at 4077th
	Mobile Army Surgical Hospital.
	Henry B. Blake, Commanding Officer.'
	  (informally, on
	  his own)
	Nice going, Trapper.

Ugly John and Captain Bandini shake Trapper's hand in congratulations.  The
only two officers in the outfit who don't like the news come out of the Mess
Hall together: Major Burns and Houlihan.

		HOT LIPS
	There's no point appealing to
	Colonel Blake.  They've got him
	bewitched.

		FRANK
	No. The only thing to do is
	write General Hammond.
	  (knowing perfectly
	  well she has her
	  own tent)
	But it's hard to find a place
	around here for a private
	discussion.

		HOT LIPS
	I have a tent to myself.

		FRANK
	People will talk.

		HOT LIPS
	I don't mind.  If we give them
	something to talk about.

							TIME LAPSE:

48	INT. HOT LIP'S TENT - NIGHT

Hot Lips finishes reading the letter she and Frank have drafted, signs it
and stands up as she folds it and puts it in a prepared envelope.

		HOT LIPS
	I think it's a marvelous letter.

		FRANK
	We're a good team.

		HOT LIPS
	We think the same way.

		FRANK
	It's supper time.
	  (as casually as
	  he can say it)
	But you're not hungry are you?

		HOT LIPS
	Ravenous.  What about you?

		FRANK
	  (trying to hide
	  his disappointment)
	Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...

		HOT LIPS
	Anyway, we want to get this
	letter off.

He grabs her and kisses her and from her reaction we get a clear picture
of the kind of female she is.  She responds to the kiss fervently, pressing
her lips and body against his, but the moment she decides to end it she
switches right back to her businesslike manner.

		HOT LIPS
	The sooner it reaches him, the
	sooner we can turn this into a
	tight military outfit.

						BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

49	INT. MASH MAIN BUILDING - AT MAIL DEPOSIT BOX - NIGHT

Frank deposits the letter in the box while Hot Lips stands by.  Then they
proceed on their way to the Mess Hall, unaware that they have been observed
by Radar on the other side of the partition into which the mailbox is set.

50	INT. MASH MAIN BUILDING - NIGHT

Radar picks up the letter Frank deposited and reads the address.

51	INT. THE SWAMP - NIGHT

There is a party going on.  Present, in addition to the three occupants, are
Painless, Ugly John, Bandini, Judson, Vollmer, Ho-Jon, Boone, Murrhardt and
Seidman.  Radar enters, engages Hawkeye's attention and shows him the letter.
Hawkeye glances through it, looks to Radar for confirmation and, getting it,
tears up the letter.  Meanwhile under Duke's leadership, a bedpan is affixed
with adhesive tape to Trapper's head.

		DUKE
	Hail to the chief!  We-all got a
	responsibility, men.  He's crowned
	like a king ought to be, but he
	can't just walk to the Mess Hall
	by himself.  He has to be carried
	by native bearers.

		HAWKEYE
	Good thinking, Duke.  How about
	it, Ho-Jon?  Can you round up a
	few of the boys?

		HO-JON
	I don't get what you mean, native
	bearers.

		MURRHARDT
	Bear is the same thing as carry.

		HO-JON
	It's the other word I'm not sure.

		HAWKEYE
	  (afraid of where
	  this is leading)
	Never mind.  Forget it.

		DUKE
	  (simultaneously)
	A native is someone who is born
	in a particular place.

		HO-JON
	And if I go to New York, the
	natives there will carry me?  I
	don't think so.

		HAWKEYE
	I don't think so either.

		DUKE
	I don't think I should have opened
	my big mouth.  Sorry, Ho-Jon.

		HO-JON
	  (smiling)
	That's okay.  Live a little,
	learn a little.

							TIME LAPSE:

52	INT. MESS HALL - NIGHT

Frank and Hot Lips, sitting by themselves in a corner are disgusted, and
the rest of the people there are mildly amused, by the spectacle of
Trapper's entrance.  The new Chief Surgeon, still wearing his bedpan
crown, is borne in on his cot by Hawkeye, Duke, Painless and Ugly John.
They set him down and break into song.

		DUKE, HAWKEYE
		PAINLESS AND UGLY JOHN
	  (singing)
	Hail to the Chief
	And King of all the surgeons
	He needs a queen
	To satisfy his urgin's.

		TRAPPER
	  (loudly, pointing
	  at Hot Lips)
	I'd like to try out that one over
	there.

		HAWKEYE
	Very well, Your Majesty.
	  (starting toward
	  Frank and Hot Lips)
	Congratulations, Frank.  He picked
	you.

		TRAPPER
	No, no, that one.

		HAWKEYE
	Oh, you want to play it straight?
	  (to Hot Lips)
	I guess I owe you an apology.

Her eyes blazing with indignation, Hot Lips gets up and stalks out.
Frank follows her.

							TIME LAPSE:

53	INT. HOT LIPS' TENT - NIGHT

Frank is sitting next to Hot Lips on her cot with a soothing arm around
her.

		FRANK
	Godless buffoons, all of them.

		HOT LIPS
	  (her hands on his
	  face, turning it
	  towards her)
	It's that disrespect for you,
	that's what I can't forgive them.

		FRANK
	Oh, I'm used to it.  What makes
	me sore is how they behave towards
	you.
	  (pulling her into
	  a tight embrace)
	They ought to be grateful to have
	you.
	  (kisses her, his hand
	  vanishing beneath her
	  skirt)
	I certainly am.

		HOT LIPS
	  (undoing one of
	  his buttons and
	  sliding her hand
	  under his blouse)
	And I'm grateful for you, Frank,
	especially with those boors around.
	We've grown very close in a short
	time.

He kisses her around the neck and bosom, removing such of the clothing as
gets in the way.

		FRANK
	It isn't just chance, I'm sure
	of that.  God meant us to find
	each other.

Instead of lingering on a scene that threatens to become pornographic, our
attention is drawn down beneath Hot Lips' cot, where a strange object is
being inserted under the canvas wall of the tent.  It is a microphone.

		HOT LIPS
	His will be done.
	  (then, in excited
	  response to an
	  inflammatory move
	  on his part)
	Da-a-arling!

54	EXT. HOT LIPS' TENT - NIGHT

Radar, who has just planted the microphone, lets a coil of wire spin out
as he moves away.

						BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

55	INT. HENRY'S OUTER OFFICE - NIGHT

Gathered here illicitly, in what is not only Sergeant Vollmer's domain but
the communication hub of the post, are Trapper, Duke, Radar and Ugly John.
They are listening, on their own private speaker, to what is being said in
Hot Lips' tent.

		HOT LIPS' VOICE
	  (over speaker)
	Frank...Frank...Frank...Frank...
	Frank...

		DUKE
	What'd'y'all reckon he's doing
	to her?

		TRAPPER
	Casting her horoscope.

		FRANK'S VOICE
	  (over speaker)
	Give me your lips, love.  Set
	me on fire.

		DUKE
	  (to Radar)
	Plug it in, boy.  We got no call
	to be selfish with a show like this.

Radar accordingly transfers the lead from the microphone to the outlet for
the post loudspeaker system.

A-55	EXT. ENLISTED MEN'S TENTS - NIGHT

The occupants of one tent are engaged in a crap game, while the men in the
adjoining one are settling down for the night.  They are all dumbfounded
to hear Hot Lips' voice over the public address speakers.

		HOT LIPS' VOICE
	  (over speaker)
	I want you to make love to me
	all night.  I don't want anything
	to take you away from me.

B-55	INT. OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

Hawkeye is performing surgery on a patient, assisted by Captain Bandini.
Both doctors and Leslie, the nurse working with them, have stopped to
listen to the lovers' dialogue coming over the OR speaker.

		FRANK'S VOICE
	  (over speaker)
	Nothing can, with the Colonel
	gone.  I'm in charge tonight.

C-55	INT. HOT LIPS' TENT - NIGHT

Frank is on top of Hot Lips and, though the details of their amorous
activity are hidden under the covers, we can see enough to know it is
reaching a climax.

		HOT LIPS
	I like a man who is in charge.

Each word she speaks is instantly echoed on the speaker system so that
the word "charge" is still sounding after she has finished saying it.
She suddenly realizes there is something wrong, though she doesn't
immediately figure out what it is.

		HOT LIPS
	  (disturbed)
	Frank...

		FRANK
	Don't stop now!  Please...

The word "please" is repeated so distinctly outside that, while Frank in
his critical condition remains unaware of it, Hot Lips sits bolt upright,
pushing him aside.

		HOT LIPS
	Wait a second...

		FRANK
	I can't...couldn't.

D-55	EXT. FRONT OF THE 4077TH - DAY

A Jeep driven by Henry pulls up near the hospital entrance, from which
Radar emerges to meet him.  Leslie also joins them.

		RADAR
	Good morning, Colonel.

		HENRY
	Morning, Radar.  How were things?

		RADAR
	Splendid, sir.  No problems.

		HENRY
	Morning, Captain.

		LESLIE
	Morning, Colonel.

E-55	INT. MESS HALL - DAY

Hot Lips is finishing breakfast at a table with some of the other nurses.
Frank is sitting near her but at another table with a handful of male
officers, including Hawkeye directly opposite him.  Duke and Trapper enter
together as Hot Lips rises to leave.

		TRAPPER
	  (cheerily, to nurses)
	Morning, girls.  Good morning Major.

		HOT LIPS
	  (coldly)
	Good morning.

		DUKE
	Hiya, Frank.  Hiya, Hot Lips.

Duke and Trapper continue on their way to their table in the officers'
section.  Frank reacts angrily and is about to go after Duke when Hot Lips
touches his shoulder and speaks in a low tone.

		HOT LIPS
	No, leave all the rowdiness to
	them.  Calm down, drink your
	coffee.

Hawkeye probably can't make out her exact words, but his gaze follows her
as she goes out the open door.  The he looks at Frank, bending low across
the table as if he, too, had something confidential to say, but actually
speaking quite distinctly.

		HAWKEYE
	Tell me, Frank, is that stuff
	you're tapping any good?

Frank reacts with such rage he can't speak for a moment.

F-55	EXT. MESS HALL - DAY

Henry, Leslie and Radar, passing by the Mess Hall entrance, encounter Hot
Lips on her way out.  Her salute catches Henry by surprise, but he makes
a quick stab at returning it though his attention is on what he sees
through the Mess Hall windows.

		HENRY
	  (to Radar)
	Hawkeye and Frank Burns.  That's
	encouraging.

G-55	INT. MESS HALL - DAY

Hawkeye, who can see Henry outside (which Frank can't), affects surprise
at receiving no answer to his question.

		HAWKEYE
	I was just asking...

		FRANK
	Shut up or I'll tear you apart.

H-55	EXT. MESS HALL - DAY

		HENRY
	Can you make out what they're
	talking about?

		RADAR
	I can try, sir.

I-55	INT. MESS HALL - DAY

		HAWKEYE
	I only wanted to know what she's
	like in the sack.  Do those big
	boobs hold up or are they kind
	of droopy?

J-55	EXT. MESS HALL - DAY

		RADAR
	  (to Henry)
	Hawkeye's asking the Major's
	opinion on a point of anatomy.

K-55	INT. MESS HALL - DAY

		HAWKEYE
	Also I'm curious whether she's
	a moaner or...

		FRANK
	Say that again and I'll kill you.

L-55	EXT. MESS HALL - DAY

		RADAR
	The Major wishes to have the
	question repeated.

M-55	INT. MESS HALL - DAY

		HAWKEYE
	You know, does she go in for
	sound effects...?

He keeps a wary eye on Frank while talking, and thus is able to duck the
coffee pot Frank hurls at him.  From where Henry stands in the doorway,
this act of unprovoked aggression is astonishing enough, for he can see
Hawkeye innocently eating his cereal, but the Colonel is even more amazed
when Frank follows it by springing across the table onto Hawkeye and
raining blows on him.  Hawkeye puts up no resistance but simply covers
his head and screams.

		HAWKEYE
	Help!  He's gone mad!  Help,
	somebody!

							TIME LAPSE:

56	EXT. MASH COMPOUND - DAY

Two MPs are dragging Frank in a straitjacket to an MP Jeep.  They load
him into the back and one of them gets in alongside him while the other
takes the wheel.

Watching the MPs drive off with their prisoner are Henry, Duke and
Trapper.

		DUKE
	Fair's fair, Henry.  If I get
	into Hot Lips and jump Hawkeye
	Pierce, do I get to go home, too?

							TIME LAPSE:

57	EXT. REPUBLIC OF KOREA ARMY INDUCTION CENTER IN SEOUL - DAY (SNOW IS
GONE)

It is now February.  A jeep with Hawkeye at the wheel, Ho-Jon beside him,
drives up to the entrance.  Hawkeye gives Ho-Jon a final instruction as
the boy gets out of the Jeep and goes into the building.  Hawkeye finds
a place to park in the shade.  Lieutenant Scorch is with them.

		LIEUTENANT SCORCH
	It was really nice of you to
	take me along.

		HAWKEYE
	I didn't have much choice.

		LIEUTENANT SCORCH
	You really say the cutest things.

		HAWKEYE
	Yeah!

57	INT. KOREAN ARMY INDUCTION CENTER - DAY

The locale is established by the presence of military personnel in
uniform and the fact that a KOREAN ARMY DOCTOR, with the aid of one
assistant, is examining in quick succession a long line of naked young
Korean boys.  Ho-Jon's turn comes up and we see how perfunctory the
process is: a brief overall scrutiny for visible defects, a blood
pressure reading, and the application of a stethescope to a few key
spots.  Ho-Jon looks healthy and the doctor is startled by the
unexpected reaction he gets on applying the stethscope to the boy's
heart.  He turns to check the blood pressure figure which his
assistant is about to record on the form he has taken from Ho-Jon.
Apparently the pressure is just as out-of-line as the heartbeat, and
the doctor feels Ho-Jon is ineligible for military service.

		KOREAN DOCTOR
	  (to assistant, in
	  Korean)
	We can't take this one.  His
	heartbeat is much too fast, and
	his blood pressure is dangerously
	high.
	  (to Ho-Jon)
	Have you ever seen a doctor before?
	  (abruptly, to
	  assistant)
	Wait a minute!  What does it say
	there about where he's been working?
	  (takes Ho-Jon's form
	  and reads the
	  information for
	  himself; then, to
	  assistant)
	Get the check on his urine sample
	right away.
	  (to Ho-Jon)
	You'll have to wait around for
	a while, young man.  I need some
	more information before I talk
	to you again.

						BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

59	EXT. KOREAN ARMY INDUCTION CENTER - DAY

Hawkeye, with Lieutenant Scorch, waiting in the Jeep, is startled at
being addressed by a stranger, whom he recognizes as the doctor that
examined Ho-Jon.  Ho-Jon is with him.

		KOREAN DOCTOR
	  (in English)
	You please excuse...
	  (as Hawkeye turns
	  and sees them)
	I have been making examination
	of this young man to find if he
	will be soldier in our army.

		HAWKEYE
	Yes, I know.  Hi, Ho-Jon.  How
	did it go?

		KOREAN DOCTOR
	I don't liking it at all, what I
	hear when I listen to the heart.
	And such a blood pressure for so
	young a boys.  Is frightening.

		HAWKEYE
	I'm sorry to hear that.  You think
	he's unfit for military service?

		KOREAN DOCTOR
	At first is no doubt.  But then I
	am seeing on his paper he work in
	American hospital.  And I think
	there are so many drugs in such a
	places, he could take some by
	mistake.

		HAWKEYE
	Why would he do that?

		KOREAN DOCTOR
	Who is knowing?  But the drug I
	have find in his urine is solving
	all mysteries.  By tomorrow will
	be gone his fast heart and high
	blood pressure.  So I think maybe
	you will like to tell him goodbye.
	Okay?

He gives Hawkeye a warm smile and leaves the two of them alone.  It's
clear from Hawkeye's expression that he has no choice but to admit
defeat.

		HAWKEYE
	Sorry, Ho-Jon.  I didn't think
	they'd be that sharp.  But I'm
	still going to start the ball
	rolling for you to go to college
	in America when you get out.  My
	old school, Androscoggin.

							TIME LAPSE:

60	EXT. OFFICERS' LATRINE - DAY

It's a warm spring day in a climate much like the northeastern part
of the United States.  At first we see nothing but the latrine tent,
which is identified by a sign.  A couple of small missiles propelled
with considerable force strike the canvas, but it is only when they
roll back to the ground that we can identify them as golf balls.  A
closer look at the ground area reveals a dozen other balls scattered
around, and then we see two Korean Houseboys appear from protected
places on the sides of the tent, looking carefully to make sure there
are no more balls coming, and proceed to gather up those on the
ground.  During this action there is the SOUND of a helicopter
landing near the hospital.

61	EXT. FIELD BEHIND OFFICERS' LATRINE - DAY

The disrepubility in clothes and grooming that has been increasing
with each view of the Swampmen has reached an extreme stage in the
view we now get of Hawkeye and Trapper.  ALong with their soiled
fatigue pants, Hawkeye wears a torn, dirty T-shirt of some unlikely
color, Trapper a sport shirt that looks as if he had picked it up
in Hawaii on the way over and worn it ever since.  Both are unshaven.
Each has a well-equipped golf bag into which he now replaces the iron
club he has been using for the medium-range shots they have been
practicing.  Taking out drivers, they set tees in the ground and, as
the houseboys run up with the balls, Trapper indicates they will be
shooting down the longest dimension of the field.  After addressing
the balls with a few practice swings, they deliver expert drives that
are not only in the 250-yard range but fairly straight in the intended
direction.

		HAWKEYE
	  (pleased with himself)
	I came within about ten yards of
	you.  You know something, Trapper,
	the way we been going, if we ever
	got to see a real golf course
	again, I bet we could burn it up.

		TRAPPER
	As far as the greens maybe.  I
	don't know if my putting would
	come back or not, without some
	practice.

The SOUND of the helicopter taking off again doesn't concern them till
they realize it is headed directly toward them.  It comes down so close
to them they step back to avoid the wind from the propeller blades,
which the PILOT keeps going as he and Vollmer climb out.

		VOLLMER
	  (to pilot)
	That's him on the right.

		PILOT
	That's Captain McIntyre?

		VOLLMER
	  (to Trapper)
	The Lieutenant's flown up from
	Seoul just to find you.

		PILOT
	You're Captain McIntyre?

		TRAPPER
	That's what the Army calls me.
	Stick out your tongue, take off
	your shirt and tell me where it
	hurts you.

His face showing his bewilderment, the Pilot silently hands Trapper a
long white envelope and a large brown one.  Trapper tears open the
white one, glances at the top copy of the order it contains.

		TRAPPER
	'...Proceed immediately to
	Kokura, Japan...'
	  (to Pilot)
	Do you know what this is about?

		PILOT
	There's a GI there whose father's
	a Congressman.  A grenade went off
	in training and they think there's
	a piece of it in his heart.

		TRAPPER
	  (opening brown
	  envelope)
	These his X-rays?

		PILOT
	Yes, sir.  Apparently some big
	chest surgeon in Boston told the
	Congressman the only man to take
	care of his son was Captain John
	McIntyre.
	  (his doubt
	  undiminished)
	I suppose there could be more
	than one doctor with that name...

Trapper meanwhile has held the X-rays up to the sunlight and invited
Hawkeye to look at them at the same time.

		TRAPPER
	  (looking back at
	  orders; to Hawkeye)
	General Hammond says I can take
	anyone along I need to assist
	me.  Want to come?

Hawkeye uses the pretense of scanning the X-rays from another angle to
draw Trapper aside, so they can speak without the Pilot and Vollmer
hearing them.

		HAWKEYE
	I'm not so sure the goddam
	thing's in his heart.

		TRAPPER
	'Course it isn't, but how many
	chances do we get to go to Japan?
	With our golf clubs.

							TIME LAPSE:

62	EXT. AIRPORT IN KOKURA, JAPAN - DAY

It is a bright, sunny afternoon in peaceful Japan.  Hawkeye and Trapper,
in the same outlandish clothes, walk from the military transport plane
in which they have made the trip from Seoul, and approach a car with
"25TH STATION HOSPITAL" emblazoned on its side.  The driver, SERGEANT
GORMAN, is asleep.  With their golf clubs slung over their shoulders,
they get into the back seat.  Hawkeye pulls the door closed with the
loudest possible BANG, and succeeds in waking Gorman, who turns on them
with outraged indignation.

		GORMAN
	Garrada there!

		TRAPPER
	What?

		HAWKEYE
	Let me translate.  I've had some
	exposure to the language.  The
	young man is from Brooklyn and he
	wants us to vacate this vehicle.

		TRAPPER
	  (to Gorman)
	But weren't you supposed to meet
	the surgeons who are going to
	slice up the Congressman's son?

		GORMAN
	You guys are the quacks?

		HAWKEYE
	You betcher ever-loving A, buddy-
	boy.

		GORMAN
	Poor kid.  Goddam Army.

		TRAPPER
	But besides the operation, we've
	got to get in at least eighteen
	holes of golf.

		HAWKEYE
	So let's haul ass, Sergeant.

		GORMAN
	Goddam Army.

But he starts the engine.

							TIME LAPSE:

63	INT. ARMY CAR - DAY

There is silence between Sergeant Gorman and his passengers as the
military hospital comes into view.  But something else comes into view
in the distance at the same time: the unmistakable contours of a golf
course.

		TRAPPER
	Look.

		HAWKEYE
	Beautiful.  What do you think?
	Should we stop and play nine
	holes now and operate on the kid
	later?  If he's still alive.

		GORMAN
	Goddam Army.

		TRAPPER
	I think we ought to operate first,
	no frills, get through it on the
	double.  Then we'll be nice and
	relaxed on the course.

		HAWKEYE
	Good thinking.

		GORMAN
	Goddam, goddam Army.

They are coming to a stop in front of the hospital.

						BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

64	INT. 25TH STATION HOSPITAL - DAY

A PRETTY WAC sits behind a reception desk doing a job so utterly
routine she doesn't even look up from her magazine when Hawkeye puts
a question to her.

		HAWKEYE
	Where's the Congressman's son
	at, honey?

		PRETTY WAC
	Ward Six.

But then she does glimpse enough of their costumes to take a full look,
and her reaction indicates clearly that she is not prepared for unkempt,
unmilitary-looking men carrying golf bags.

		PRETTY WAC
	Hey you can't go in there!
	Who are you?

		HAWKEYE
	I'm the pro from Dover and this
	is my favorite caddie.

		PRETTY WAC
	Well, you can't go in.  No till
	you tell me your business and I
	check with Colonel Merrill's office.

		HAWKEYE
	  (relenting)
	Well, if you must know...

But Trapper has meanwhile made a feint toward the door, to which the
Pretty Wac responds by rising and interposing herself in his path.

		TRAPPER
	  (to Hawkeye)
	Hold it.  If this soldier enforces
	her own orders.  I'm ready to take
	her on.  Anxious.  Single combat.

He moves toward the girl, who holds her ground staunchly till they are
almost in contact.  Then she takes a step back, and continues to take
one step backwards for each one of his in her direction.  When they get
close to the door, her resistance collapses entirely and she scurries
back to her seat at the desk, where she grabs the phone as Trapper and
Hawkeye march through the door.

		PRETTY WAC
	  (into phone)
	Colonel Marril's office.

65	INT. 25TH STATION HOSPITAL - DAY

All personnel, American and Japanese (who, like the Koreans at MASH, do
the menial work) react in surprise to the sight of Trapper and Hawkeye
making their way around a few corners till they find Ward Six.

						BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

66	INT. WARD SIX - DAY

Two golf bags are propped against the foot of the Congressman's son's
bed.  Trapper listens closely to the boy's chest while Hawkeye bends
down to his ear to reassure him.  A WARD NURSE hovers near him, not
actually cooperating with them but not defying them either.

		HAWKEYE
	  (to Congressman's
	  son)
	Don't worry, son.  That's Captain
	McIntyre, and he's the best chest
	surgeon in the Far East and maybe
	in the whole U.S. Army.  He'll
	fix you up fine.  Your daddy saw
	to that.

		TRAPPER
	Just like we thought, it's a
	routine problem.  Nurse, who's
	in charge of operating room
	preparations?

By the time he has begun his question to her, the WARD NURSE has spotted
someone approaching of whom she is in obvious dread.  And it is at this
figure that she points by way of answer: a firece-looking NURSE CORPS
CAPTAIN.

		WARD NURSE
	Sh-sh-she is.

Anticipating that a major confrontaion is about to take place, Trapper
and Hawkeye decide to keep it away from their patient's beside.
Accordingly they pick up their golf bags and go to meet the advancing
Captain.

		NURSE CORPS CAPTAIN
	What are you hoodlums doing in
	this hospital?

		HAWKEYE
	  (politely)
	We're surgeons, ma'am, we're here
	to work.  All we want is our
	starting time.

		NURSE CORPS CAPTAIN
	You can't even look at a patient
	here till Colonel Merrill says it's
	okay.  And he's still out for lunch.

		TRAPPER
	  (quietly)
	Look, Mother.  I want to go to
	work in one hour.  We're the pros
	from Dover and we figure to crack
	that kid's chest and get out to
	the golf course before it's dark.
	So find the gas-passer and tell him
	to premedicate the patient.  Then
	bring me the latest pictures on him;
	the ones we saw must be forty-eight
	hours old by now.  And tell the
	kitchen to rustle up some lunch.
	Ham and eggs'll do; steak would be
	even better.  And give me at least
	one nurse who knows how to work
	in close without getting her tits
	in my way.
	  (as she hesitates)
	You're going to have to move
	quicker than that.  I said an hour.

							TIME LAPSE:

67	INT. 25TH STATION HOSPITAL OPERATING ROOM - DAY

CAPTAIN E.B. (ME LAY) MARSTON is the anesthesiologist at the 25th.
Wearing gown, cap, and mask, he is busily at work checking the
Congressman's son to make sure he is properly anesthetized.  At that
moment the doors open and in come Trapper and Hawkeye, also wearing
OR outfits, as are the two nurses who stand by waiting for them.
Trapper looks questioningly at Me Lay, who answers with a nod that all
is ready.

							TIME LAPSE:

68	INT. 25TH STATION HOSPITAL OPERATING ROOM - DAY

The atmosphere in the OR is tense.  Hawkeye is maintaining proper
traction on the clamp that holds the lung in place, while Trapper
concentrates on removing the fragment.

		TRAPPER
	Got it.

		COLONEL MERRILL
	I demand an explanation!

COLONEL MERRILl, Commanding Officer of the hospital, has stormed through
the OR swinging doors in full military uniform without any antiseptic
precautions.

		HAWKEYE
	  (to circulating nurse)
	Get that dirty old man out of
	the operating room!

		COLONEL MERRILL
	I'm Colonel Merrill!

		HAWKEYE
	Beat it, Pop.  If this chest
	gets infected, I'll tell the
	Congressman who did it.

To everyone's astonishment, inclusing the Colonel's, it works.  He turns
around and walks out without another word.  Most affected of all by
Hawkeye's audacity is Me Lay, who reacts with a sharp look in Hawkeye's
direction and then by picking up his anesthesia chart and writing, in the
space labeled "First Assistant," the name "Hawkeye Pierce."

		TRAPPER
	Okay, I'm closing up.  Everybody
	relax.

		ME LAY
	  (to Hawkeye)
	May I have the surgeon's name.
	please?

		HAWKEYE
	He's the pro from Dover and I'm
	the Ghost of Smokey Joe.

		ME LAY
	Save that crap for the rest of
	the clamdiggers back home.

Both surgeons stop working in their surprise.  Hawkeye looks at the
anesthesia chart and sees where Me Lay has written his name.  Then he
takes a closer look at Me Lay himself, or what shows of him between his
cap and his mask.

		HAWKEYE
	  (to Trapper)
	Did I ever tell you about Me Lay
	Marston?

		TRAPPER
	Your high school friend who went
	around saying 'Me lay, you lay?'
	to all the young females in the
	community.  As I remember, you
	said it was quite a successful
	approach.

		HAWKEYE
	Well, he wouldn't score more than
	once in seven or eight tries, but
	the important thing was he didn't
	waste time socializing.  Anyway,
	Trapper John, this is Me Lay.

		ME LAY
	The real Trapper John?  The one
	who threw you the famous pass and
	went to greater glory on the
	Boston and Maine Railroad?

		HAWKEYE
	The one and only.

		ME LAY
	Proud to know you, Trapper.  Like
	to shake your hand if you'll hurry
	up and get that chest closed.
	  (looks around to
	  make sure the nurses
	  can't hear)
	You still working the trains?

		TRAPPER
	Planes mostly.  May take a crack
	at rickshaws.  How does the direct
	approach work over here?

		ME LAY
	I been out of action sice I got
	over here five months ago.

		HAWKEYE
	You don't go after the local
	scrunch?

		ME LAY
	I'm too busy, actually.  Not for
	the Army, of course, but where I
	live.  Dr. Yamachi's New Era
	Pediatric Hospital and Whorehouse.
	I'm serious.  The guy has this
	crude hospital for kids and a
	whorehouse on the side to finance
	it, all in the same building.

							TIME LAPSE:

69	INT. SURGEONS' DRESSING ROOM, 25TH STATION HOSPITAL - DAY

Hawkeye and Trapper have washed and put their golf practice clothes
back on.  Me Lay is dressed in fresh fatigues with Captain's bars.

		HAWKEYE
	  (to Me Lay)
	What do you do in the joint
	besides pimp?

		ME LAY
	That's about the only thing I
	don't do - that I'm built for.
	I inspect the girls and take care
	of some of the kids in the hospital.
	Sometimes I tend bar and act as
	bouncer.

A CORPORAL enters with the manner of a messenger from on high.

		CORPORAL
	Captain Pierce?  Captain McIntyre?
	Colonel Merrill wishes you to
	report to his office immediately.

		HAWKEYE
	Tell him we'll think about it.
	  (to Trapper)
	I suppose we do have to reach
	some sort of understanding with
	the old boy.

		TRAPPER
	  (to Me Lay)
	What's the bastard really like?

		ME LAY
	  (for the Corporal's
	  benefit as well as
	  theirs)
	Colonel Merrill is a veteran of
	twenty-five years in the Regular
	Army, a soldier first and a doctor
	second.  A member of several
	patriotic organizations, he
	believes it's America's God-given
	mission to maintain a foothold
	for freedom on the Asian mainland.

		TRAPPER
	That bad?
	  (to Hawkeye)
	But I guess you're right.  We
	might as well see him.
	  (reaches for golf
	  bag, to Corporal)
	Got any caddie carts?

		CORPORAL
   What?

Trapper just slings his golf bag over his shoulder with a sigh, as does
Hawkeye.  Me Lay, meanwhile, has written a few words on a scrap of paper.

		TRAPPER
	  (to Corporal)
	Never mind.

		ME LAY
	  (hands paper to
	  Hawkeye)
	The address of the N.E.P.H. and
	W.  Why don't you meet me there
	when you're through golf for
	drinks and dinner and whatever
	strikes the fancy?

		TRAPPER
	Mine's already been struck, and
	it doesn't have to be very fancy.

		HAWKEYE
	  (to Corporal)
	Lead the way.

The Corporal does so and they follow him out.

70	INT. 25TH STATION HOSPITAL - DAY

Hawkeye and Trapper come out of the dressing room after the Corporal
and follow him down a corrider.  Then they realize to their surprise
that there are two other soldiers following them who have been stationed
outside the dressing door.  Their invitation from the Colonel is getting
to seem less casual every moment.

71	INT. COLONEL MERRILL'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY

A SECOND LIEUTENANT and a Sergeant seated on opposite sides of a desk
look up with interest as Trapper and Hawkeye come in with escorts fore
and aft.

		SECOND LIEUTENANT
	These the prisoners?

		CORPORAL
	Yes, sir.

Hawkeye and Trapper exchange looks.

		SECOND LIEUTENANT
	They can wait in the Colonel's
	office.  He'll be back in a few
	minutes.

The Corporal opens the door to the Colonel's empty and quite luxurious
office.  Trapper and Hawkeye go in with their golf bags.

72	INT. COLONEL MERRILL'S OFFICE - DAY

Trapper and Hawkeye enter, the door closing behind them, and look around.
It is a long time since they have seen surroundings like these, with
Western upholstered furniture, pictures on the walls and high quality
wall-to-wall carpeting.  It is this last feature that attracts Hawkeye's
attention.  He squats down to feel its texture and with a look invites
Trapper to do the same.  Trapper is also impressed with the smoothness
of the surface, and without having to exchange a word about it, they each
find a putter and a golf ball and start lining up targets for their brief
sorely missed putting practice.

						BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

73	INT. COLONEL MERRILL'S OFFICE - DAY

The Colonel comes in militarily, which is the way he makes all his
entrances.

		COLONEL MERRILL
	You men are under arrest!

		TRAPPER
	Quiet!  Can't you see I'm putting?

		COLONEL MERRILL
	I'll have you...!

		HAWKEYE
	Please!
	  (completes a putt,
	  walks over and
	  picks up ball)
	Face it, Colonel, you don't have
	us, we have you.  Your boys blew
	this case, we bailed you out.  We
	figure we ought to hang around a
	day to check the Congressman's
	kid, and we also figure to play
	some golf.  So if that's okay
	with you, we got a deal.

		TRAPPER
	And if it isn't, why don't we
	call Washington on your telephone?
	You tell your story, we'll tell
	ours.

		HAWKEYE
	  (picking up his
	  clubs)
	When you make up your mind, get
	in touch.  The golf club is
	probably the best place to leave
	a message.

Trapper has also taken his golf bag, and the two of them walk out
serenely together.  The Colonel supports himself on his desk as he makes
his way to his chair and sits down to absorb the shock to his system.

							TIME LAPSE:

74	INT. JAPANESE GOLF CLUB PRO SHOP - LATE AFTERNOON

The shop features an assortment of Western style golfing attire, all
about two decades behind the times.  Trapper is holding a pair of 'plus
fours' in front of him to test the size.  The GOLF PRO looks on with the
studied approval of the dedicated salesman everywhere; Hawkeye with
amusement.

		TRAPPER
	These the longest you've got?

		GOLF PRO
	Wonderful.  They are looking
	like they are made for you.

Hawkeye has discovered a pair of knee-length argyle socks, which he
exhibits to Trapper.

		HAWKEYE
	We got to have these to wear
	with them.
	  (glances out
	  window)
	You know, by the time we get all
	this stuff on, it'll be practically
	dark.

Two GIRL CADDIES enter the shop while he is speaking.  They are very
young, not more than seventeen, dressed in slacks.  They see Trapper and
Hawkeye's golf bags and start to sling them over their shoulders.

		TRAPPER
	  (agreeing)
	Yeah, maybe we ought to...
	  (sees caddies)
	Hey, who are they?

		GOLF PRO
	Your caddies.  But perhaps it is
	becoming too late to start.

		TRAPPER
	  (walking over to
	  caddies for closer
	  look)
	Not at all.
	  (touches the prettier
	  one under the chin to
	  raise her downcast head)
	What's your name, honey?

		HAWKEYE
	Come on, Trapper.  We got to
	forget golf for today.

		TRAPPER
	I don't know why.  As long as it's
	light enough to see your caddie.

		HAWKEYE
	  (to Golf Pro)
	What's the age of consent in this
	country?

		GOLF PRO
	Which?  I do not know what you
	mean.

		HAWKEYE
	Never mind.
	  (to Trapper)
	Let's take one sport at a time.
	The place for tonight's is the New
	Era Pediatric Hospital Et Cetera.

						BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

75	INT. DR. YAMACHI'S N.E.P.H. &amp; W. - DINIG ROOM - NIGHT

Trapper and Hawkeye, dressed in kimonos, are sitting Japanese style on
the floor with Me Lay around a low table.  Three girls serve them
attentively, doing everything for them except actually feeding them. A
girl named MICHIKO takes away a plate that Trapper has left virtually
untouched and puts a bowl of thick soup in front of him.  The second girl
serves soup to Hawkeye and Me Lay, and the third brings in a large bowl
of rice.

		TRAPPER
	Soup?  Rice?  What are we doing,
	beginning all over again?

		ME LAY
	No, we had a clear soup to start.
	This is a thick one and you ought
	to taste it.  There's nothing
	like it back home.

		TRAPPER
	How can I taste it now?  We've
	already had like twelve courses.

		MICHIKO
	You are not wishing to eat more?
	I bring you most special plum
	brandy.

		TRAPPER
	I don't want it.  I don't want
	to eat, I don't want to drink.
	  (reaches out and
	  grabs Michiko's
	  ankle)
	All I want...

There is a KNOCK on the door, followed immediately by the entrance of a
Japanese nurse, who indicates an urgent desire to speak to Me Lay.  Me
Lay gets up and listens to what she tells him in an undertone.  Trapper
meanwhile has succeeded in pulling Michiko off her feet, and makes
clear the general direction of his intentions by sprawling out on the
floor with her in his embrace.

		ME LAY
	  (to Hawkeye and
	  Trapper)
	Can you guys take one minute to
	look at a kid for me?

		TRAPPER
	Now?

		HAWKEYE
	  (to Me Lay)
	Why can't you look at him?

		ME LAY
	I have but well, you know, I've
	been mainly an anesthetist a long
	time now and...well, I'd like you
	guys to take a look at him.

		HAWKEYE
	What's the story?

		ME LAY
	Well, one of the girls got careless
	and two days ago she gave birth to
	an eight-pound American-Japanese male.

		HAWKEYE
	What's wrong with him?

		ME LAY
	Every time we feed him, it
	either comes right back up or he
	coughs and turns blue and has a
	hell of a time.

		TRAPPER
	  (releasing Michiko
	  and sitting up
	  reluctantly)
	We don't have to see him.  Call
	that half-assed Army hospital and
	tell them to be ready to put some
	lipiodol in this kid's esophagus
	and take X-rays.

		ME LAY
	But it's ten-thirty at night.  We
	can't get military personnel out
	for a civilian.  A foreign civilian.

		HAWKEYE
	Don't give them any unnecessary
	details.  Just say the pros from
	Dover are on their way with an
	emergency.  And you'd better get
	the OR cranked up because I got a
	feeling you're going to pass some
	gas while I help Trapper close a
	little bastard's tracheo-esophageal
	fistula.

76	INT. 25TH STATION HOSPITAL OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

Three OR nurses are at work getting things on order when the swinging
doors open and Me Lay, carrying the two-day-old baby, enters,
accompanied by Hawkeye and Trapper.  Nothing has led the nurses to
expect an infant patient, and they are distinctly taken aback.

		FIRST OR NURSE
	Where did that baby come from?
	Is that what you got us up for?

		HAWKEYE
	Yes, ladies, that's why we got
	you up.  Me Lay, put him down
	there...
	  (indicating operating
	  table)
	...and get ready to start giving
	him the anesthetic.
	  (to nurses)
	We stumbled on this deal.  We
	didn't want it but we don't see how
	we can walk away from it, no matter
	whose rules are broken.  This baby
	has no legal right to be taken care
	of in an Army hospital, though his
	father was probably an American
	soldier.  But he's going to die if
	we don't fix him now, tonight.  So
	what about it?

		FIRST OR NURSE
	Let's get going.

Me Lay places the mask attached to his gas container on the baby's face
ans starts to administer a carefully limited quantity.

		COLONEL MERRILL
	This time I will not be intimidated!

He has come into the OR while he is talking, and he is so menacing that
all preparations are halted while he finishes his pronouncement.

		COLONEL MERRILL
	I command that this improper and
	illegal use of Army facilities
	cease immediately.  Twice you men
	have forced me into appeasing your
	aggression by threatening me with
	what you'll say to a certain
	Congressman.  Well, I don't care
	what you tell him or anyone else!
	I don't care if it costs me my
	command and my whole career in the
	Army.  On this point I stand as a
	matter of principle, as unshakable
	as the Rock of Gibralter.

		HAWKEYE
	Me Lay?  Trapper?

Moving in concert, Hawkeye and Trapper grab Colonel Merrill and drag
him over to Me Lay's end of the operating table.  Me Lay takes the
anesthetic mask from the baby's face and clamps it firmly on the
Colonel's.  The Colonel struggles for a while but they manage to hold
him and pretty soon he is quiet.

		HAWKEYE
	Is he out?

		TRAPPER
	Like the Rock of Gibralter.

							TIME LAPSE:

77	INT. DR. YAMACHI'S N.E.P.H. &amp; W. - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Trapper, Hawkeye and Me Lay are half-dragging, half-carrying Colonel
Merrill along a corrider, and girls, including Michiko and the others
we have seen before, have come out of their rooms to watch.

		ME LAY
	He's coming to.

		HAWKEYE
	Let's get his clothes off quick.

						BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

78	INT. DR. N.E.P.H. &amp; W. - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Colonel Merrill is stirring on the bed as Hawkeye and Me Lay remove
the last item of his clothing.  The Colonel opens his eyes but he is
still too drugged to have any idea where he is or how he got there.

		ME LAY
	Okay, Michiko.

Michiko moves toward the bed, removing the kimono which is her only
garment.  At the same time Hawkeye grabs a camera, which is all ready
for use with a flashbulb attachment and starts to take a series of shots
of the Colonel and Michiko, both naked in the bed.  The Colonel reacts
to the intermittent bursts of light.

		COLONEL MERRILL
	What the hell's going on?

		MICHIKO
	Please, you no worry, sweetheart.
	Just keeping close.

		HAWKEYE
	  (after five or six
	  shots)
	All right, that's plenty.  You
	can put your clothes on, Colonel.

Michiko reaches for her kimono and puts it back on as she gets out of
bed.  The Colonel sits up, still a bit dazed but becoming more aware of
what's happening all the time.

		COLONEL MERILL
	I've been framed!

		HAWKEYE
	That's what they all say.  But
	I have photographic evidence here
	that you're a lecherous old man
	and a disgrace to the uniform.
	However, I won't even develop the
	film if your people watch that baby
	we operated on like he was the
	Congressman's gradson.  Which for
	all we know he may be.

79	INT. DR. YAMACHI'S N.E.P.H. &amp; W. - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Michiko joins Me Lay.

		MICHIKO
	Where is Captain McIntyre?  I am
	waiting so long for him.

Me Lay open a bedroom door, revealing Trapper fully dressed and sound
asleep on the bed.

		ME LAY
	Give him a few hours, Michiko.
	Right now he couldn't get up a
	flight of stairs.

Michiko's answering smile indicates superior feminine wisdom in these
matters.  She goes into the room, closing the door behind her.

								TIME LAPSE:

A-79	INT. WARD SIX. 25TH STATION HOSPITAL - DAY

Hawkeye, dressed in the Japanes adaption of the well-dressed American
golfer of the 1930's, and caryying his golf bag, is at the Congressman's
son's bedside.  He looks at the boy's chart and then at the patient
himself, finding both of them quite satisfactory.

B-79	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Trapper, similarly outfitted with individual variations of his own, has
just examined the baby they operated on.  He writes out some
instructions and gives them to a nurse.  Then he picks up his golf bag
and goes out to a corrider where Hawkeye is waiting for him.  They start
to walk toward the hospital entrance, finally ready for a few hours of
relaxation on the golf course.

		VOICE
	  (over loudspeaker
	  system)
	Captain Pierce and Captain
	McIntyre!  Please contact the
	message center.  Captain Pierce
	and Captain McIntyre!

They look at each other with foreboding.

		HAWKEYE
	It couldn't be good news.

By joint unspoken agreement, they quicken their pace in the same
direction.  Then their resolution falters.

		TRAPPER
	  (to a passing nurse)
	Where's the goddam message center?

								TIME LAPSE:

80	INT. 4077TH MASH - LATE AFTERNOON

OR facilities are being utilized to capacity.  For the first time we
see Henry himself in surgeon's working dress, winding up an operation.
Completing his work, looking tired and anxious, he walks through the
crowded OR to the Preop Ward, which is also jammed up with cases awaiting
surgery.  Leslie comes to meet him.

		HENRY
	What's the lineup, Major?

		LESLIE
	Six cases ready for surgery,
	sir, and four more that just
	need a little more blood or a
	little more time for the
	antibiotics to take hold.

		HENRY
	I guess we can handle them, if
	there aren't any six o'clock
	choppers.  Every time they fly
	while it's still daylight, they've
	got wounded that can't wait.

							BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

81	EXT. LANDING AREA OUTSIDE 4077TH MASH - LATE AFTERNOON

Henry's watch says a minute or two after six o'clock.  Once more, as at
the beginning, he is standing outside the Admitting Ward with Radar,
listening for helicopters coming from the north.  Radar, straining his
superhearing to listen, reacts unhappily to a sound neither we nor
Henry can catch.

		RADAR
	Chppper coming in, Colonel.  Two
	of them, I'm afraid.

		HENRY
	Damn.

		RADAR
	  (a puzzled look)
	And another one, but it's from
	the south.
	  (looking south)
	There.

Henry looks eagerly to the south as the COMBINED SOUND of three
helicopters becomes audible and quickly mounts in intensity.

82	EXT. SKY TO THE SOUTH - DAY

A helicopter (the type that came from Seoul to pick up Trapper and
Hawkeye, rather than the Air Rescue Squadron ones that bring the wounded
from the front) approaches the landing area and starts to make its
descent.  There is a golf bag full of clubs attached to each of its pods.

						BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

83	INT. ADMITTING WARD - DAY

Trapper and Hawkeye, conspicuous because they are still in their golf
costumes, are among the surgeons checking the newly arrived wounded.
More cases are still being brought in from helicopters and ambulances,
mainly on stretchers, a few under their own power assisted by a Medical
Corpsman or two.  This is really the most hideous face of war; the
mangled bodies and limbs and faces, the expressions alive with pain
and dulled by shock, are more terrible than any number of quiescent
corpses.  Trapper finishes examining a man and speaks to Hot Lips.

		TRAPPER
	This one goes right to the OR.
	Tell Duke to do him ahead of the
	busted spleen.
	  (moving on to
	  another patient,
	  a Korean)
	And this kid can't wait.  I'll
	take him myself, before I get to
	that ruptured diaphragm.

		HOT LIPS
	Captain...
	  (securing his
	  attention)
	'This kid' is a prisoner of war.

		TRAPPER
	Yeah?

		HOT LIPS
	It's an American boy's rupture
	you're supposed to close.

		TRAPPER
	Listen, we get a deluge like
	this, just deciding priorities
	on a medical basis is hard
	enough.  So never mind the side
	issues.

						BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

84	INT. OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

A few days later.  Duke is working deep inside a belly with a new young
surgeon, CAPTAIN LAPHAM, assisting him.  Lapham glances at the patient's
face.

		LAPHAM
	Duke...

Duke looks, too, and the patient's eyes are enough to tell him the job
he's doing no longer has any function.  After an almost superfluous check
of the heartbeat, Lapham closes the man's eyes.

85	INT. OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

Hawkeye, with Ugly John handling the anesthetic, is digging out pieces
of metal from a face that will never quite look like a face again.

86	INT. OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

Trapper, with Painless filling in as anesthesioloigist, is working in
close to a patient's heart.  Suddenly all the lights in the OR go out.
This is not an unprecedented event, and one by one three corpsmen appear
in different locations around the operating table with flashlights whose
combined beams make it possible for Trapper to carry on.

87	INT. OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

With the electric light restored, Duke and Lapham are at work on another
case, removing several feet of small bowel no longer useful to the owner.

88	INT. OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

Henry and Murrhardt, with Scorch assisting, are amputating an arm.

89	INT. OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

A dead patient, face covered with a sheet is removed from an operating
table by two corpsmen.  Immediately two other corpsmen bring a stretcher
to the other side of the table and unload a new patient onto it.  Ugly
John and a nurse start to prepare him for surgery.

90	INT. OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

Hawkeye, with Knocko helping, is sewing up an incision which we can see
is in the area of the groin.  Dago Red comes by.

		DAGO RED
	Nice looking kid.  Going to be
	okay?

		HAWKEYE
	He'll live if that's what you
	mean.  But somebody better be
	around when he comes to and finds
	out there's nothing left between
	his legs.

							TIME LAPSE:

91	INT. ADMITTING WARD - DAY

A few days later.  A new group of patients is being brought in on
stretchers by corpsmen.  Trapper and Duke are examining an unconscious
Negro private.  Trapper looks at him with special attention to the
eyes.  The right pupil is dilated and fixed.  Duke meanwhile checks his
pulse and blood pressure.

		DUKE
	Pulse, slow, very little pressure.

		TRAPPER
	Look at that right eye.

		DUKE
	Epidural hematoma?

		TRAPPER
	I don't know what else.  You've
	been that route a little, haven't
	you?

		DUKE
	Not enough to be a pro.

He moves to another case.  Duke continues to examine the private with
particular attention to the right side of the head.  The more he
observes, the more alarmed he becomes.

		DUKE
	  (to corpsman)
	Into the OR!  Right now.

He runs ahead of the stretcher through the Preop Ward.  At the entrance
to the OR he runs into Knocko.

		DUKE
	Quick, Knocko, get me gloves,
	knife, hammer, chisel, Gelfoam
	and a drain.

						BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

92	INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY

Knocko finishes saving and cleaning the right temporal area of the
unconscious private's head, and Duke wastes no time making an incision
down to the bone.

		DUKE
	Okay, give me the hammer and
	chisel.  There are drills you
	can make nice, neat holes in the
	skull with, but we ain't got none.
	  (taking hammer and
	  chisel, fortifying
	  himself for the act)
	So here goes.

He pounds the chisel into the private's skull and keeps at it till he
cracks his way through.  Blood flows out in a torrent.  Duke pulls his
tools away and just watches.  Very quickly he is rewarded by the sight
of a torrent diminishing to a dribble.

		KNOCKO
	What happens now?

		DUKE
	We sew him up.

He stuffs Gelfoam down into the bleeding site, puts in a rubber drain
and starts to sew the skin back together with silk sutures.

						BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

93	INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY

The private is moaning and stirring restlessly on the table as Duke
finishes closing the incision and Knocko takes the Patient's pulse.

		KNOCKO
	Pulse is way back.  Nearly sixty.

		DUKE
	We took the pressure off his
	brain.  You know, Knocko, this
	boy might just make it, and if
	he does you and me ought to be
	ready with a story.

		KNOCKO
	What do you mean?

		DUKE
	One thing everybody knows for sure
	that don't know hardly anything
	else, is how delicate any kind of
	brain surgery is.  So I certainly
	wouldn't like it if there was
	somebody going around saying all
	I did was crack him on the head
	with a hammer and chisel.

						BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

94	INT. ADMITTING WARD - DAY

Hawkeye is examining a young PRIVATE FIRST CLASS who is in shock,
semiconscious and saturated with mud over his whole uniform, hair and
skin.  There is a muddy, bloody bandage around his neck.

		HAWKEYE
	  (to a corpsman)
	Get that bandage off so I can
	see what the hell's underneath.

He moves on to the next stretcher.  The corpsman undoes the bandage and
pulls it away.  The Private First Class turns his head to the left, and
blood spurts two feet into the air from a hole in the right side of his
neck.

		PRIVATE FIRST CLASS
	Mama, Mama!  Oh, Mama, I'm dying!

The blood continues to gush as the people in the immediate vicinity
watch in fascination.  As it comes down again if falls on the PFC's face
and into his mouth.  He reacts by coughing, spraying his audience with
blood.  Hawkeye runs back and sticks his index finger down the hole,
blocking off the severed artery and stopping the flow of blood.

		HAWKEYE
	  (to corpsmen)
	Bring him to the OR right on this
	stretcher.  I can't take my finger
	out.  Somebody find Ugly John and
	get his ass in there.

They are already in motion toward OR, Hawkeye moving along beside the
stretcher with his finger in the hole.  On the way they pass near Leslie.

		HAWKEYE
	This one is urgent, Les.  Start
	somebody cutting off his clothes.
	Tell the lab to come in with a
	couple of pints of low titre O,
	and type and cross-match him for
	five or six more.  Get somebody to
	do two countdowns and start the blood.
	Come to think of it, get somebody
	to start rounding up donors, and
	send some cowboys to Seoul for all
	the goddam blood they can get.
	And get that miserable gas-passer
	in here!

		UGLY JOHN
	  (at OR entrance)
	I'm here.

		HAWKEYE
	Good.  Get him asleep and a tube
	in him if you can.  His common
	carotid is cut and I can't do
	anything with the son-of-a-bitch
	jumping all over the place.
	  (to Leslie)
	Find somebody to help me.  I got
	to keep a finger on this or we
	lose him, and I can't get it
	clamped with my left hand.

						BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

95	INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY

The PFC has been transferred to an operating table without Hawkeye
losing his finger pressure on the artery.  The clothes have been cut
off him, and Ugly John has both blood and anesthetic going into him,
the latter through an intratracheal tube.  Hawkeye has a scalpel in
his left hand and with it he enlarges the wound around his right
index finger.  Then he tries to slide a Kelly clamp down his finger
into the wound to clamp the artery but he can't manage it left-handed.
He looks desperately around the OR only to observe that every surgeon
and nurse is fully engaged, including Henry and Hot Lips.  Ugly John
is having a hard time fulfilling his dual function as it is, and can't
possibly take on another.  Hawkeye tried again with the clamp and
fails, and then, to his great relief, there appears within in his
peripheral vision as he concentrates his attention on the PFC's neck,
a male figure, gowned, capped, masked and gloved.  It doesn't matter
to Hawkeye which of his colleagues it is; he just tells him what
assistance he needs from him.

		HAWKEYE
	Grab this Kelly, ride it down
	my fingers and we'll have this
	mother under control.

The newcomer, though Hawkeye doesn't realize it, is Dago Red.  Following
instructions, he takes the clamp and inserts it in the wound.

		DAGO RED
	What do I do with it Hawk?  This
	is a little out of my line.

		HAWKEYE
	Didn't recognize you, Red.  When
	you get the clamp all the way down,
	open it as wide as you can and see
	if you can close it on the artery.

Dagor Red obeys these orders cautiously.  When he widens the clamp and
starts to close it again, he has the satisfying sensation of feeling
something substantial, and siezes it vigorously.

		DAGO RED
	I got !  I got it!

But what he has grabbed with the clamp is Hawkeye's finger and Hawkeye,
by reflex action, pulls it out to where we can see it with the clamp
grasping it.  The blood starts to spurt again and Hawkeye goes back into
the wound, but this time with his left index finger.

		HAWKEYE
	You got my finger for Christ's
	sake.  But maybe I can do better
	with my right hand.
	  (inserts a retractor
	  into wound, puts the
	  working end of it in
	  Dago Red's hands,
	  taking back the Kelly
	  clamp)
	Pull it toward you.  More.  Good.
	  (rides clamp down his
	  left index finger and
	  this time he closes
	  it on the right place)
	There.  That does it for now.
	  (to Ugly John)
	We'll keep him right where he is
	till Trapper John can give me a
	hand sewing that artery back
	together.

							TIME LAPSE:

96	EXT. LANDING AREA OUTSIDE 4077TH MASH - LATE AFTERNOON

Two helicopters descend to the ground, and corpsmen start unloading
the wounded.  Also visible are a couple of ambulances that are being
unloaded.  Henry and the three Swampmen have stepped outside the
Admitting Ward entrance to watch.  They are all haggard, unshaven and
groggy, but Henry, the oldest, is the one who shows the strain the most.

		HENRY
	Fifteenth straight day there've
	been six o'clock choppers.
	How long can a battle go on?

		HAWKEYE
	You got to relax, Henry.  Since
	the deluge started, you been
	working in the OR and running the
	outfit, too.

		TRAPPER
	Best thing you could do for all
	of us is grab some sack time.

		HAWKEYE
	  (calling)
	Radar!

Radar appears as usual on the instant.

		RADAR
	Yes, sir?  I've been trying to
	persuade the Colonel to take
	some rest.

		DUKE
	Well, stop persuading, just make
	him.

		RADAR
	  (to Duke)
	Yes, sir.
	  (to Henry)
	Come along, sir.

Henry is so fatigued he allows himself to be led away by Radar.

		HAWKEYE
	Believe me, Henry, outside of us,
	no one'll even know you're gone.

							TIME LAPSE:

97	INT. PREOP WARD - DAY

Here the more seriously wounded of those brought into the Admitting Ward
are getting transfusions, have had Foley catheters inserted in their
bladders and/or Levin tubes in their stomachs, and have their X-rays on
display on wires in front of each cot.  Trapper, Hawkeye and Duke are
checking them to establish priorities.  They reach the last cot, on
which Ho-Jon is lying, attended by a Corpsman we haven't seen before.

		CORPSMAN
	This kid is pretty bad.

Out of habit Hawkeye looks at the X-ray first.

		HAWKEYE
	For you, Trapper.

		TRAPPER
	  (looking at X-ray)
	Okay, but I'll need you to help.
	Duke, will you take that belly
	back there?  The Australian?

Duke turns back to undertake his assignment.  Trapper and Hawkeye continue
to study the X-ray.

		HAWKEYE
	It's in pretty deep.

		TRAPPER
	Yeah, and he's lost a lot of
	blood.  I'm afraid it's hit more
	that just the lung.

Ho-Jon opens his eyes and smiles at the sight of his old friends.

		CORPSMAN
	  (to Ho-Jon)
	You''l be okay, boy.

		HO-JON
	I know.  I got the best there
	is.  Captain Pierce and Captain...

		HAWKEYE
	Christ, it's Ho-Jon!

		TRAPPER
	Hiya, Ho-Jon.  You got a piece
	of a shell in your chest, but
	we'll take it out as soon as you've
	had more blood.  Hey, Radar!

Radar, passing through the ward, comes over in response to the summons.

		TRAPPER
	  (to Radar)
	Has that A-negative come from
	Seoul?  We'll need some in the OR.

		RADAR
	There isn't any.  We keep ordering
	and they don't deliver.

		HAWKEYE
	We got to have at least one pint.
	It's for Ho-Jon.

Radar reacts in surprise and looks toward Ho-Jon's cot.

						BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

98	INT. OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

Hawkeye is assisting Trapper in making the incision in Ho-Jon's right
chest.  Ugly John is giving the boy additional anesthetic.

		HAWKEYE
	If we squeeze him through, I'm
	going to get him into Androscoggin
	College.

		TRAPPER
	How about squeezing him through
	into Dartmouth?  If all he wants
	to do is catch lobsters, he can
	learn that here.

		HAWKEYE
	Dartmouth's too big and too
	expensive.  If he's as good as I
	think he is, he can move into the
	big league later.  But Androscoggin
	first.

		TRAPPER
	  (studying the incision)
	We'll need room.  The sixth rib
	goes.

		HAWKEYE
	Never mind the conversation.  Do
	it, Dad.

		TRAPPER
	You aspirate the blood from the
	chest cavity.  Damn, there's more
	of it than I thought.

		HAWKEYE
	  (preparing to
	  use suction device)
	If we don't get that pint, he's
	in trouble.

99	EXT. AND INT. HENRY'S TENT - NIGHT

Radar, followed by an associate lab technician, enters Henry's tent.
Henry is snoring away in deep sleep.  Gently Radar straightens Henry's
right arm and deftly injects Novocaine over a vein.  Henry stirs.

		HENRY
	  (mumbling in sleep)
	Not now, honey.  Gobacksleep.

The lab technician tightens the sleeve of Henry's T-shirt to serve as
a tourniquet, and Radar expertly inserts a needle into the vein and
starts extracting blood into a pint container.

100	INT. OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

Hawkeye has finished aspirating the blood.  Trapper reaches down into
the wound.

		TRAPPER
	  (triumphantly)
	I got it.  Here, feel.  In the
	cava.

He takes his hand out and lets Hawkeye put his in.

		HAWKEYE
	I don't feel anything.

		TRAPPER
	Oh, Jesus.

He indicates that he wants to feel again.  Hawkeye withdraws his hand
and Trapper puts his back in again.

		TRAPPER
	I can't feel it now either.  The
	mother must have gone in.

		HAWKEYE
	I don't get it.

		TRAPPER
	It was in the cava and the hole
	sealed itself off.  I must have
	jiggled it just enough to turn it
	loose.  I can't feel it in the
	heart or the right pulmonary
	artery.  So it's in the left
	pulmonary artery.

		HAWKEYE
	What do we do?

		TRAPPER
	We'll have to close this hole
	and make one on the other side.

		HAWKEYE
	Be kind of rough on him if there's
	no blood.  Why don't we close up
	and sit on him a couple of days?

		TRAPPER
	Sure, that's the right way...at
	John Hopkins or someplace.  But
	how do we know there won't be
	even more of a jam-up a few days
	from now?  Maybe we won't be able
	to get to him when we want to.
	Maybe the goddam thing'll erode
	the artery when nobody's looking.
	Our best shot is now.

Radar comes up to the operating table with a container of blood.

		RADAR
	A-negative.  I've cross-matched
	it.

		HAWKEYE
	I though you said we didn't
	have a drop.

		RADAR
	I found a doner.

							TIME LAPSE:

101	INT. OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

Trapper has exposed Ho-Jon's left pulmonary artery.  Duke and Hawkeye
are assisting him by applying traction to the tapes on either side of
where Trapper is now cutting the artery, so that there is only a small
flow of blood from the incision.  Trapper brings out his hand and
displays the tiny metal fragment which is the object of their efforts.

		TRAPPER
	  (to Ugly John)
	How is he?

		UGLY JOHN
	Nice.

		TRAPPER
	  (to nurse)
	Arterial silk.

He starts to sew the artery back together.

						BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

102	INT. OPERATING ROOM

The artery is joined again.

		TRAPPER
	  (to Hawkeye and
	  Duke)
	Ease off on those tapes, and
	let's see how much it bleeds.
	  (sees a few drops
	  of blood come
	  through incision)
	How is he?

		UGLY JOHN
	Nice.

		TRAPPER
	Boys, we're home free.

		HAWKEYE
	When will he be able to write?

		DUKE
	What's he got to write, for God's
	sake?

		HAWKEYE
	An application to Androscoggin
	College.

							TIME LAPSE:

103	INT. HENRY'S OFFICE - DAY

Henry is on the phone.  Hawkeye, Duke, Painless and Radar wait eagerly
for the news.

		HENRY
	  (into phone)
	Colonel Blake here.

104	INT. GENERAL HAMMOND'S OFFICE, 325 EVAC HOSPITAL - DAY

HAMMOND, a one-star general, has a major and a lieutenant colonel with
him as he talks to Henry.

		GENERAL HAMMOND
	  (into phone)
	I got news for you, Henry.
	You've been so concerned about
	that battle for Old Baldy.  It's
	all over.

105	INT. HENRY'S OFFICE - DAY

Henry nods happily to the others to tell them that the word is favorable.

		HENRY
	  (into phone)
	Thanks, General.  Thanks for
	calling.

He hangs up and turns to the others to pass on the General's exact words.

106	INT. GENERAL HAMMOND'S OFFICE, 325 EVAC HOSPITAL - DAY

The General wasn't through talking and didn't expect Henry to hang up at
that point.  He is quite startled, in fact, because he has been saving
the most important piece of information for the end.

		GENERAL HAMMOND
	  (to major and lieutenant
	  colonel)
	He didn't wait to hear who won.

							TIME LAPSE:

107	EXT. FIELD NEAR RIVERBANK - DAY

A very hot day in late August.  Standing all by itself in an empty field
is a sign on which some fairly careful carpentry and lettering work has
been expended.  It reads: "38TH PARALLEL MEDICAL SOCIETY MEETS HERE
SUNDAYS."

CAMERA PANS to the river, where Trapper, Hawkeye and Duke are lying on
their stomachs, naked or nearly so, on air mattresses.  The heat from
which they seek relief is obviosly intense, and they are pampering
themselves further with tall, ice-filled drinks.  On the riverbank near
them stands one empty cup and one half-full bottle of Pimms No. 1 Cup,
and all three surgeons are more noticeably drunk than we have previously
seen them.

		TRAPPER
	She had this shiny black hair
	piled up on her head, but later
	on she let it hang loose and I'll
	be damned if it didn't come all
	the way down to her ass.

		DUKE
	I've always had a hankering for
	blonde pussy myself.  My wife's
	hair is a wonderful golden yellow,
	and this time of year it gets even
	lighter.

		HAWKEYE
	I guess that's why you go for Hot
	Lips Houlihan.

		DUKE
	You know damn well I nearly puke
	when I look at her.  I don't even
	think she's a real blonde.

		HAWKEYE
	How can you say a thing like that
	about an officer in the United
	States Army?

		DUKE
	I not only say it, I'll back it
	up twenty buck's worth.

		HAWKEYE
	You got yourself a bet, Georgia
	boy.
	  (to Trapper)
	You're a witness.

		TRAPPER
	Okay, I'm a witness, but how do
	you prove who's right?

		DUKE
	There's only one way.

							TIME LAPSE:

108	EXT. SHOWER TENT - NIGHT

twelve hours later.  The shower tent is simply an ordinary Army tent
enclosing a row of showers supplied by a water tank on a high platform
in back of the tent.  Duke and Hawkeye are working under cover of
darkness to loosen each of the stakes that secures the tent to the
ground around it.

							TIME LAPSE:

109	EXT. THE SWAMP - DAY

the following afternnon.  Trapper and Hawkeye sit in chairs outside
their tent, glasses in hand, still on their tall, hot-weather drink
kick.  Trapper looks at his watch.

		TRAPPER
	It's five minutes into nurses'
	shower hour.  Where are they?

		HAWKEYE
	They're coming.

110	EXT MASH COMPOUND - DAY

The Swamp is at the end of the officers' row nearest the nurses' tents,
so they have a good view of the women as they emerge from their quarters
dressed in bathrobes and carrying towels, shower caps and bars of soap.
The first two to appear are Knocko and Lieutenant Scorch.  Next, from
her own private tent, comes Hot Lips.

		HAWKEYE
	Hey, Knocko, I got those pictures
	you promised to look at of my kids.
	You too, Wilma.  It won't take a
	minute.
	  (to Hot Lips politely)
	You can see them too, if you want.

		HOT LIPS
	No, thank you.  I'm not the
	slightest bit interested.

She continues on across the compound and enters the shower tent.  Knocko
and Lieutentant Scorch come over to the Swamp while Hawkeye goes inside to
find the pictures.  Then two more nurses emerge from a tent and head for
the showers.  Trapper gets up and saunters over to intercept them.

111	EXT. SHOWER TENT - DAY

The door of the tent is closed behind Hot Lips, and after a moment there
is the sound of water being turned on.  Then our attention is drawn to
the peak of the tent, to which a thin scarcely visible strand of wire has
been attached.  The wire is drawn taut and runs across the peak of the
barbershop tent next door and down the far side of it to where Duke sits
on the ground operating a sort of windlass upon which the wire is wound.
He turns the crank with a quick burst of energy.

Back at the shower tent the force of the wire pulls the canvas tight, the
loosened stakes come out of the ground, and the whole tent is whisked
right off its center pole, revealing Hot Lips nude under the shower.

112	EXT. BARBERSHOP TENT - DAY

Duke abandons his machine and moves to where he can get the crucial view
of Hot Lips.  The he calls across the compound to Hawkeye.

		DUKE
	Okay, Yankee know-it-all!  Pay
	up!

						BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

113	INT. HENRY'S TENT - DAY

Hot Lips, in her robe, her hair still wet from the shower, carrying her
towel and shower cap, is expressing her wrath forcefully to Henry,
ignoring the facts that he is in bed and that Leslie is in bed with him,
which explains why we have never seen anybody make a pass at her.

		HOT LIPS
	This isn't a hospital, it's an
	insane asylum!  And it's your
	fault because you don't do anything
	to discourage them!

		HENRY
	What do you expect me to do?

		HOT LIPS
	Put them under arrest!  See what
	a court-martial thinks of their
	drunken hooliganism.  It started
	with their calling me Hot Lips and
	your letting them get away with it.
	You let them get away with everything!
	And if you don't turn them over to
	the MPs now, I'm going to resign my
	commission and...!

		HENRY
	Oh, g-g-goddamit, Hot Lips, resign
	your g-godam c-commission!

							TIME LAPSE:

114	EXT. FRONT OF 4077TH MASH - NIGHT

two days later.  An Army car bearing the single star of a brigadier
general drives up to the entrance.  The sergeant at the wheel jumps
out and open the rear door for General Hammond and his aide, a captain.

		GENERAL HAMMOND
	  (to aide)
	Tell them I want to talk to all
	the officers on the post except
	those on emergency duty.

						BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

115	INT. MESS HALL - NIGHT

Most of the officers of 4077th Mash are assembled to listen to General
Hammond.  Henry and Hot Lips are both in the front row but separated
by some distance and not looking at each other.  All the Swampmen are
on hand.

		GENERAL HAMMOND
	...These are very serious
	accusations, and without prejudging
	the charges against him, I am
	suspending Colonel Blake from all
	his duties during the investigation,
	which I will conduct myself.  I will
	also serve as your Commanding Officer
	during that time.  I shall be
	calling on a number of you for your
	individual testimony on the points
	at issue.  Thank you.  Carry on.

116	INT. DENTAL CLINIC - NIGHT

Hawkeye, Duke and Painless are playing poker with a British, a
Norwegian and an Australian officer.  It is close to two o'clock the
same night.  General Hammond opens the door and looks in, doesn't like
what he sees and steps inside.  All six players are immediately aware
of his presence but decide to act as if they weren't.

		HAWKEYE
	  (to British Officer,
	  who is dealing)
	Gimme three.

		GENERAL HAMMOND
	At ease.  Captain Pierce, you
	have a seriously wounded patient
	for whom you are responsible.  Yet
	I find you in a poker game.

		HAWKEYE
	You betcher ass, Dad.

		GENERAL HAMMOND
	What?

		BRITISH OFFICER
	One to the dealer.
	  (to Hawkeye)
	You're the opener.

		HAWKEYE
	Check.

		GENERAL HAMMOND
	Pierce!  That soldier requires
	immediate attention.  I'm a
	surgeon and I know.

		HAWKEYE
	You betcher ass, General.

		BRITISH OFFICER
	I'll wager a dollar.

		DUKE
	I fold.

		PAINLESS
	See the bet.

		NORWEGIAN OFFICER
	Me likewise.

Hawkeye and the Australian throw in their hands.

		GENERAL HAMMOND
	Are you going to take care of
	your patient or are you going to
	play poker?

		BRITISH OFFICER
	King-high flush.

Painless and the Norwegian throw in their hands, and the Englishman
pulls in the pot.

		HAWKEYE
	  (to the general)
	I'm going to play poker until three
	a.m. or until the patient is ready
	for surgery.
	However, if you'd like to operate
	on him yourself right now, be my
	guest.  I get the same dough
	whether I work or not.

		GENERAL HAMMOND
	I want to talk to you, Pierce.

		HAWKEYE
	There's nothing to talk about,
	General.  You take the case
	yourself or join me at three
	o'clock.  Either way you're liable
	to learn something.

The General is far from pleased with the disrespect accorded him, but
as the poker players start a new hand, he decides against making an
issue on terms selected by Hawkeye.  Instead he turns around and goes
out.

								TIME LAPSE:

117	INT. OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

Ugly John is attending a Korean soldier on the operating table with
a belly wound.  The OR clock reveals that the time is 2:55.  Hawkeye
and Seidman look in.

		UGLY JOHN
	He's practically there.

		HAWKEYE
	  (to Seidman)
	Please ask General Hammond to
	join us.

							BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

118	INT. SURGEONS' WASH-UP ROOM - NIGHT

General Hammond joins Hawkeye at the scrub sink, prepared to take part
in the coming operation.

		HAWKEYE
	General, at one-thirty when I
	checked him last, this guy had had
	less than a pint of blood, and he'd
	lost two or three.
	His pulse then was 120 and his
	blood pressure was about 90.
	Now, at three o'clock, he's had
	three pints of blood.  His pulse
	is 80 and his pressure 120.  His
	collapsed lung has been expanded
	and he's had a gram of terramycin
	intravenously.  We can operate on
	him safely and we should do it
	quickly, but we don't have to do
	it frantically or carelessly.

								TIME LAPSE:

119	INT. OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

Hawkeye has been doing the repair work in the patient's belly, with
General Hammond functioning as a largely nonparticipating assistant.
The incision is still open with sections of bowel on which repairs
have been done still exposed.

		HAWKEYE
	Now, General, I'm going to sandbag
	you.  Do you think we're ready to
	get out of this belly?

		GENERAL HAMMOND
	Obviously you don't think so, and
	I don't know why.

		HAWKEYE
	Well, Dad, we haven't found any
	holes in the large bowel.  They've
	all been in the small bowel, but
	the smell is different.  I caught
	a whiff of large bowel, but it
	ain't staring us in the face, right?

		GENERAL HAMMOND
	Right.

		HAWKEYE
	So if it ain't staring us in the
	face, it's got to be retroperitoneal.
	And that, along with the look of
	the wounds, makes me figure he's
	got a hole in his sigmoid colon that
	we won't find unless we look for it.

He has been working all the time he has been talking, and now, after a
little more manipulation within the incision, is able to indicate the
perforation he has hypothecated.

		HAWKEYE
	And there it is.

		GENERAL HAMMOND
	I'm impressed, Pierce.  Naturally,
	the kind of job I have, I don't
	get much chance to keep up with
	what goes on in the OR.

		HAWKEYE
	Neither does Henry Blake.  But
	I'll tell you what makes him the
	best C.O. you've got in any of
	your hospitals.  He leaves all the
	medical decisions to the men who
	do the day-to-day work and
	understand what meatball surgery
	is.

								TIME LAPSE:

120	INT. THE SWAMP - DAY

the following day.  General Hammond is having a drink with Hawkeye,
Trapper and Duke.  Ho-Jon keeps the glasses full.

		TRAPPER
	It certainly isn't Henry's fault
	Hot Lips Houlihan doesn't like
	her name.

		DUKE
	Or her figger.

		HAWKEYE
	She's so square she's even against
	our having a football team.

This stirs the General's curiousity, but Duke speaks before he has a
chance to ask his question.

		DUKE
	You don't think we'd be speaking
	up for a goddam Regular Army
	colonel, do you, if it wasn't
	important?
	Begging your pardon, General.
	I forgot.

		GENERAL HAMMOND
	  (to Hawkeye)
	Football?

		TRAPPER
	Anybody you replaced Henry with
	couldn't last.  We guarantee that.

		GENERAL HAMMOND
	I didn't know you had a football
	team.

		HAWKEYE
	Well, it's still pretty much in
	the talk stage.

		GENERAL HAMMOND
	We had a team at the 325th Evac
	last fall.  I coached the boys
	myself.

		HAWKEYE
	I think I heard about that.

		GENERAL HAMMOND
	Now we're working out a schedule
	of the outfits we're going to play
	this year.  We all chip into a
	pool and make bets.

		HAWKEYE
	Must be fun.  But the point we
	want to make about Henry...

		GENERAL HAMMOND
	  (rising)
	I'm sure we could find a date for
	your team.  Why don't I take it up
	with Henry?
	  (exiting)
	Thanks for the drink, boys.

After the General has left, the other two Swampmen look at Hawkeye
uncomprehendingly.

		DUKE
	Where the hell we going to get us
	a football team?

		HAWKEYE
	All three of us played for our
	schools.  And there are at least
	four other guys...

		TRAPPER
	But he's got five times the man-
	power to draw on.

		HAWKEYE
	We can balance that by getting
	ourselves a ringer.  Henry has to
	say he needs a neurosurgeon and
	put in a specific request for Dr.
	Oliver Harmon Jones.

		DUKE
	Never heard of him.

		HAWKEYE
	Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker'
	Jones.

		DUKE
	The nigra boy with the Philadelphia
	Eagles?

		TRAPPER
	He only lasted one season.

		HAWKEYE
	On account he got caught in the
	doctor draft.  He was a surgical
	resident playing semi-pro ball
	weekends when the Eagles signed him.

		DUKE
	How come nobody knows about him?
	And you do?

		HAWKEYE
	I worked with Spearchucker my first
	month over here, at the 72nd Evac
	in Taegu.  Most of the colored guys
	know who he is but they're not
	talking because he asked them
	not to.

		TRAPPER
	So what makes you think he'll
	play for us?

		HAWKEYE
	We'll cut him in on the bets we
	make.  And still have enough profit
	to send Ho-Jon to college.

		TRAPPER
	Might make kind of a social issue,
	not having any other Negro officer.

		HAWKEYE
	He can move in here with us.

		DUKE
	Now wait a minute, Hawkeye.  I
	come a long way, learning to put
	up with a couple of crazy Yankees,
	but...

		HAWKEYE
	Don't tell me about your problems,
	boy.  Explain them to Ho-Jon.

121	INT. HENRY'S OFFICE - DAY

Henry, nervous at what he thinks is going to be his showdown with General
Hammond, is startled by the General's unexpected proposal.

		GENERAL HAMMOND
	If we had closer relations, there
	wouldn't be any misunderstandings.
	That's where a football game would
	help.  Between your outfit and
	mine.

		HENRY
	A football game?

		GENERAL HAMMOND
	Special Services in Tokyo are all
	for it.  They say it's one of the
	main gimmicks we have to keep the
	American way of life going here in
	Asia.

		HENRY
	But what about Major Houlihan?

		GENERAL HAMMOND
	You mean Hot Lips?  Screw her.

		HENRY
	N-n-no thanks, G-General.

								TIME LAPSE:

122	EXT. LANDING AREA OUTSIDE 4077TH MASH - DAY

It is September.  A helicopter descends to the ground in the familiar
location and, as on earlier occasions, Medical Corpsmen come from the
hospital to aid in unloading it.  But this time the cargo, instead of
wounded men, turns out to be boxes which the corpsmen rip open and
which contains football uniforms: black shoes, cardinal red jerseys,
white helmets and white pants.

								TIME LAPSE:

123	EXT. FIELD BEHIND OFFICERS' LATRINE - DAY

a day or two later.  Fifteen men are wearing uniforms from the chopper
load.  Practice at this point is confined to kicking and passing the
three footballs at their disposal, and the uniforms still look clean
and new.  Trapper is a good passer, Hawkeye is a better-than-average
receiver, and Duke punts well, but generally speaking, the balls are
dropped more often than they are caught, and the overall effect is
pretty ragged.  Among the other players are Vollmer, Ugly John, Boone,
Painless and Judson.  On the sidelines watching are Henry, with a
whistle tied to a piece of rubber hospital tubing around his neck, and,
in uniform, SPEARCHUCKER, a very big, broad-shouldered black man in
his early thirties.

		SPEARCHUCKER
	If I can make a suggestion,
	Coach.

		HENRY
	The way I run an organization,
	any man in it has the right to
	speak his mind.

		SPEARCHUCKER
	In that case, here are ten basic
	plays.  I think that's about all
	this bunch can handle.

He hands Henry ten sheets of paper, on each of which a running or pass
play is diagrammed down to the finest detail.

		HENRY
	Thank you, Spearchucker.  I'll
	certainly take a look at these.
	Where the hell did you ever get
	that name?

		SPEARCHUCKER
	I used to throw the javelin.

Hawkeye catches a pass from Trapper and runs with the ball right to where
Henry and Spearchucker are standing.

		HAWKEYE
	Listen, we look pretty lousy out
	there, right?

		SPEARCHUCKER
	Well, for college players that
	have been out of training seven
	or eight years...

		HAWKEYE
	I'm thinking about how we can
	make more money.
	  (to Henry)
	Suppose we bet only part of our
	dough and keep this big animal
	out of the game the whole first
	half and let them roll up some
	points.  Then you could bet the
	rest of our bundle between the
	halves and get the General and his
	friends to give us some real odds.

		HENRY
	It's a nice idea.  I mean it has
	style.

		HAWKEYE
	It's the only way we can make
	enough to put Ho-Jon through
	Androscoggin.

124	EXT. ATHLETIC FIELD, 325TH EVAC HOSPITAL - DAY

It is November.  The Mash team, in uniform, comes out of the quonset
hut assigned to it as dressing quarters.  Already on the bench toward
which the players head are a few supporters including Dago Red, Knocko
and Leslie.  Radar is also there serving as water boy.  Spearchucker
has a blanket wrapped over his head and held together at the chin to
eliminate the chance of his being recognized as he looks over their
opponents, who now file out of their quonset hut.  The first notable
thing about them is that they number twenty-five as opposed to a total
of fifteen in uniform for the Mash team.  Second is the even more
discouraging fact that two of them, one black and one white are
enormous, bigger than Spearchucker.  The uniforms are orange and black.

		SPEARCHUCKER
	Those two big guys were tackles on
	the Cleveland Browns, and the redhead
	played halfback with the Rams.

		HENRY
	They can't do that to me!

		HAWKEYE
	The bastards outconned us.

		SPEARCHUCKER
	I think we could still have a chance.

		HAWKEYE
	If you start the game instead of
	waiting, you mean?

		SPEARCHUCKER
	No, let's stick to that strategy
	till we see whether you boys can
	do two things.  The first is get
	that halfback out of the game.  He
	had one year with the Rams before
	the Army got him, but he didn't
	play too often because he's one
	of those hot dogs.

		DUKE
	What?

		SPEARCHUCKER
	When he sees a little running
	room, he likes to make a show...
	you know, stutter steps and
	cross-overs and all that jazz.
	Also he never learned to button
	up when he gets hit, so if you
	two can get a good shot at him
	once, you can hurt him.

		HAWKEYE
	But we'd have to break his leg
	or something to keep him out of
	the game for good.

		TRAPPER
	Not necessarily.

		UGLY JOHN
	As long as there's a pile-up, we
	can do our bit to encourage his
	permanent withdrawal from the
	contest.

		TRAPPER
	It's a technique Ugly John and I
	worked out in case something like
	this came up.

		DUKE
	  (gazing across at
	  opposition tackles)
	Look at the size of those two
	beasts.

		HAWKEYE
	I don't think I could hurt one of
	them with a sledgehammer.

		SPEARCHUCKER
	You can make them run.  They've
	got the occupational disease of
	oversized ex-athletes.  They're
	carrying thirty pounds extra
	apiece.  So we run everything
	wide, wide, wide...make them move
	more then they want to on every
	play.

125	EXT. ATHLETIC FIELD, 325TH EVAC HOSPITAL - DAY

The Mash team is lined up to kick off, which is Duke's function.  There
is only one official, a REFEREE, dressed in conventional white.

		HAWKEYE
	The pro halback is playing
	safety.  Kick it to anybody else.

Duke accordingly kicks the ball about thirty yards and angled to his
left.  But the player who takes it on the thirty-yard line simply
runs to his left and back a little toward his own goal line in order
to hand it to the RAM HALFBACK as he charges downfield from his safety
position.  He sidesteps, stright-arms or otherwise eludes all eleven
of the Mash players and runs unimpeded for a touchdown.  A few moments
later he kicks the ball over the bar for the point after touchdown.

		HENRY
	  (screaming from
	  sidelines)
	Stop him!  Stop that man!

		DUKE
	  (as they line
	  up to receive)
	Sure, you just blindfold him
	first and tie him to a stake.

Duke is the one to receive the kickoff, which he takes on the ten.  He
runs it back about twenty yards, dodging several enemy tacklers, then
sees the black tackle from Cleveland bearing down on him.  Duke runs
back and forth sideways a few times, not gaining any ground but making
the other man move.

		DUKE
	Hawkeye!

He throws a lateral pass to Hawkeye, toward whom both tackles from
Cleveland now run.  Hawkeye leads them almost from one side of the
field to the other, then reverses direction, keeping them on the move
till he sees a chance to throw a lateral to Trapper.

		SPEARCHUCKER
	  (from the bench)
	That's the stuff!  Run the hams
	off those big hogs!

Trapper returns the ball to Duke, who manages to make a couple of yards
forward and a lot more sideways before the Ram halfback cuts him down
from the rear.  The Mash team goes into its first huddle.

		TRAPPER
	  (to huddle)
	Okay, don't give them a chance
	to get their breath.  Hawkeye
	wide to the right.

They are near the sideline to their left, playing a winged T formation.
Trapper takes the ball from Vollmer, the center, runs back as if to pass
but really gives it to Hawkeye at left half as Hawkeye goes by him in a
wide sweep that takes him all the way to the right sideline with the two
Cleveland tackles in pursuit.  Hawkeye then cuts in quick and tries to
get by them but one of them brings him down for a gain of no more than
two yards.

On the next play Trapper really goes back to pass, but his blockers
are of no use against the pro tackles, whome he sees descending on him.
Trapper starts running straight back for a while, then makes a dash to
the right followed by a dash to the left.  He is almost tackled again,
and his only route of escape is back toward his own goal line.

		SPEARCHUCKER
	  (from the sideline)
	Throw it!  Throw it!

Faced with a loss of about twenty-five yards, Trapper spots Hawkeye in
the area of the line of scrimmage and whips the ball to him.  Hawkeye
catches it but there are tacklers all around him and he goes down
almost immediately for no gain on the play.  Moving faster than they
have to in order not to give the opposition any rest, the team huddles.

		TRAPPER
	  (to huddle)
	Wide to the left.  Duke, you're
	the pace-setter this time.

They go into action again.  This time Trapper, taking the ball from
Vollmer, gives it to Duke, who makes a feint at an off-tackle play,
then turns back and into a wide end run instead.  Duke is still a good
ball carrier by college standards and he has little trouble shaking off
the amateurs who try to tackle him, and is thus able to make it a
running duel with the professionals.  When they finally nab him, he is
no more than two or three yards ahead of the scrimmage line, but the
ex-tackles from Cleveland are visibly panting and wishing they hadn't
allowed all that extra poudage to accumulate.  On the fourth down, of
course, they have to punt.  Duke goes back to receive the ball from
Vollmer at center.

		HAWKEYE
	Don't try to get it far down.
	Kick it up high so we can get
	there and surround that son-of-a-
	bitch.

		DUKE
	Yeah, if I can.

He does a good job of it.  The kick is high enough so there are several
red jerseys around the Ram halfback when he gets under it.  He raises
his right arm for a fair catch.  The would-be Mash tacklers, including
Hawkeye and Trapper are frustrated.  They array themselves defensively
while their opponents have a huddle and line up to take the offense.

		HAWKEYE
	  (to Duke and Trapper)
	Let's get him this time.  I don't
	think they've got anyone else who
	can carry the ball.

As Hawkeye anticipated, the opposing quarterback slips the ball to the
Ram halfback, who starts to go wide of the tackle, sees Hawkeye,
untouched by blockers, closing in from the outside, and makes his
beautiful cross-over to cut back in.  At the same time he is hit at
the knees by Hawkeye, and high by Duke.  And there are quite a few
other Mash players in the immediate vicinity, Trapper and Ugly John
in the forefront, so that a lot of weight is piled up on top of the
flashy halfback.

A close look at Ugly John reveals him to be reaching inside his
jersey and under a shoulder pad, from which he extracts a hypodermic
needle.  With the skill of an expert anesthesiologist he pulls up
the sleeve of the tackled and stunned halfback, and plunges the
needle into his arm.

The Referee meanwhile is indignantly pulling at the Mash players on
top of the pile and orally expressing his disapproval.

		REFEREE
	Get off the guy!  He's tackled.
	You don't all need to jump on.

The Mash players quickly remove themselves.  Duke and Hawkeye are the
last to get up.  Remaining on the ground is the former halfback for
the Rams, still firmly clutching the ball but looking as if he needed
to get a lot of air into his lungs.  His captain, the white pro tackle,
takes one look at him and speaks to the Referee.

		325TH CAPTAIN
	Time!  Time!

The Referee blows his whistle to stop the clock.  The captain waves for
assistance from the sidelines, and the trainer and water boy come
running in.  Radar also appears from the opposite sideline with water
for his team.  Ugly John takes advantage of his presence to slip the
hypodermic he has been concealing in his hand into Radar's pocket.

Meanwhile there is agreement in the opposition camp that the Ram
halfback should go out of the game for a while to rest up.  A couple
of his teammates assist him to the bench.  The Mash players observe
this.

		TRAPPER
	Well, he's taken care of.  Scratch
	one hot dog.

		DUKE
	You really think we hurt him that
	bad?

		TRAPPER
	Hell, no, all you did was knock
	the wind out of him.  But he won't
	be playing any more football today.

							TIME LAPSE:

126	INT. 325TH EVAC TEAM'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

It is between the halves and the General's players are resting,
especially the ex-Cleveland tackles, who are stretched out prone.
General Hammond and his TRAINER (a medical Corps Captain) are
conecntrating on the ex-Los Angeles halfback, who sits on a table
looking groggy.  Henry sticks his head in the door.

		TRAINER
	  (to Ram halfback)

The Trainer has to assist the man, and the moment he lets go of him,
the halfback crumples to the floor.

		HENRY
	  (starting out again)
	Sorry.  You obviously won't be
	wanting any more bets.

		GENERAL HAMMOND
	The hell we won't!  You bastards
	pulled something, I don't know
	what, but we've been beating you
	without him.  Ane we'll go on
	beating you!

		HENRY
	You willing to b-back that up
	with odds?

		GENERAL HAMMOND
	Damn right.  Three to one, as much
	as you want to put up.

							TIME LAPSE:

127	EXT. ATHLETIC FIELD, 325TH EVAC HOSPITAL - DAY

The two teams have taken the field again.  Hawkeye has switched to
left end, Spearchucker replacing him in the backfield.  This time
General Hammond's men are kicking off to Henry's.  It's a long kick
but it doesn't go toward the center of the goal line, where
Spearchucker is waiting for it, but to Duke, who runs toward
Spearchucker and tosses him an easy lateral.

The two pro tackles from the Browns run down the field so as to
converge on Spearchucker around the Mash twenty-five.  But the other
Mash players divide themselves into equal units of five to do nothing
but take out the two tackles.  The other opposing players are no
problem for Spearchucker, who runs around or right through them, and
crosses their goal line for a touchdown.  The ball is brought out for
the extra point which Duke scores with a place kick.  Before the teams
reassamble for the next kickoff, the captain of the 325th team detours
a few yards toward his bench and calls something to General Hammond,
whose reaction is to stand up and shake his fist in Henry's direction.

On the Mash bench, Radar leans over to Henry.

		RADAR
	General Hammond, sir, has just
	been informed about the identity
	of Captain Jones.  His ringers
	recognized our ringer.

On the field Duke is preparing to kick off.

		HAWKEYE
	  (to Spearchucker)
	What's the matter?

		SPEARCHUCKER
	We may be in trouble, I can't
	catch my breath.  I've got the
	occupational disease of oversized
	ex-athletes.

							TIME LAPSE:

128	EXT. ATHLETIC FIELD, 325TH EVAC HOSPITAL - DAY

Spearchucker is trying to block or intercept a forward pass, but the
two tackles from Cleveland still have enough strength left to put him
out of action with their combined efforts.  They block him so
forcibly, in fact, that he drops to the ground and has some trouble
getting up.  The pass is completed and the receiver tackled on the Mash
thirty-five yard line.

		SPEARCHUCKER
	Timeout!
	  (to Referee as
	  latter blows whistle)
	How much left?

		REFEREE
	Minute and twenty-five seconds.
	And that's a first down.

Radar comes out to the Mash huddle with his water-bucket and towels.

		SPEARCHUCKER
	We got to stop them right here.

		DUKE
	And get ourselves another
	touchdown to win.
	  (looking to
	  opponents' huddle)
	I wish to hell we knew what they
	were plotting.

		HAWKEYE
	  (getting an idea)
	Radar!

		RADAR
	All you have to do is ask.
	  (concentrates on
	  the huddle twelve
	  yards away)
	The quarterback is saying they'll
	run the old Statue of Liberty.
	Their left end will come across and
	take the ball out of his hand and
	try to get around our left end.

		SPEARCHUCKER
	What else?

		RADAR
	Everyone's talking at once, but
	now the captain is telling them to
	shut up.  The quarterback says, if
	the Statue of Liberty doesn't work,
	they'll go into the double wing with
	the left halfback taking the handoff
	first and then slipping it to the
	right halfback heading to the left.

The Referee blows the whistle and the two teams line up to resume
action.  The 325th Evac quarterback drops back as if to pass, his
left end starts to his right, and the whole Mash eleven starts to
their left.  Only Ugly John finds himself temporarily buried under
a 265-pound tackle.  The other ten men in red meet the enemy left
end after he takes the ball off the quarterback's hand, and they
bring him down for a loss.  The opposing team goes into another
huddle but their strategy remains as Radar overheard it.  When the
left halfback starts to his right, the Mash players start to their
right, and after the right halfback takes over possession and tries
to turn in, he finds himself hopelessly outnumbered.  Spearchucker
hits him first with a tackle so fierce it throws him back five yards
and induces him to fumble the ball.  A pile of half a dozen Mash
players pounces on it, causing some damage to each other.

		SPEARCHUCKER
	  (to Referee)
	Time!

He goes over to the Referee and exchanges a few words with him, then
walks into his team's huddle.

		TRAPPER
	  (to Spearchucker)
	You got to be the one.  We're all
	agreed on that.

		SPEARCHUCKER
	No, it's too far and we're all
	too bushed.  I just told the referee
	we're going to try something
	different.  We make the center
	eligible by...

		VOLLMER
	Me?  I can't catch a pass.

		SPEARCHUCKER
	You don't have to.  We line up with
	everybody to the right of center
	except Hawkeye, who drops back a
	yard just before the snap.  At the
	same time Duke moves to the right
	side of the line.
	  (to Vollmer)
	That makes you eligible but all you
	have to do is take the ball right
	back from Trapper between your legs
	and hide it under your belly.
	Trapper, you make like you got the
	ball, fake to me and keep going.
	One of the big guys will hit you,
	maybe both...

		TRAPPER
	No!  I only got my GI insurance.

		SPEARCHUCKER
	  (to Vollmer)
	As soon as that happens, Sergeant,
	you start walking, not running to
	their goal line.  Remember that,
	don't run!  Come on, we just got
	time!

They break out of the huddle and line up as directed, with all the
linemen except Hawkeye on Vollmer's right.  Their opponents have
trouble adjusting to this and are even more confused when, just as
Trapper bends down to take the ball from Vollmer, Hawkeye steps
back into the backfield and Duke squeezes into the already crowded
right line.  Returning the ball to Vollmer, Trapper turns his back,
fakes a pitchout to Spearchucker, who is racing toward the line,
and continues backward, holding himself as if he still had the ball
and were fading for a long pass.  So successfully does he create
this impression that the two tackles from Cleveland, seeing clearly
that Spearchucker hasn't received the ball, descend on Trapper with
their last burst of energy.  Two other orange-and-black linemen also
fall on top of him.  Meanwhile, Vollmer, holding his arms crossed
under his stomach to further hide the ball, and looking as if her
were suffering from a painful blow beneath the belt, starts walking
down the field at an angle toward his own sideline, making the
opposition think he is heading for the bench to seek relief from his
injury.  Spearchucker stops running at about the enemy thirty, looks
back to where Trapper's tacklers are beginning to remove themselves,
but also notes out of the corner of his eye that only the opposing
safety man is anywhere near Vollmer and that he isn't paying much
attention to him.

From the bench a frantic Henry looks indignantly at the sight of his
center and Sergeant Major coming off the field.

		HENRY
	What's going on?  What the hell
	are you doing?

He opens his arms enough for Henry to see the pigskin cradled there.

		HENRY
	Then run for God's sake!  Run!

Vollmer begins to run straight toward the goal line, which has the
unfortunate effect of alerting the safety man to what is happening.
He races across the field to cut Vollmer off.  Spearchucker starts
into motion at the same instant and gets down there so fast that
just as the safety man is tackling Vollmer in a way that would throw
him out of bounds on the two-yard line, Spearchucker hurls himself
against the safety man with a strong and well-aimed block that sends
both men across the goal line.

General Hammond runs onto the field in vehement protest.

		GENERAL HAMMOND
	Illegal!  Illegal!

The Referee, looking at his watch and raising his Army .45 to signal
the end of the game, goes over to meet the General and explain the
sad truth to him.

129	INT. MASH TEAM'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

Some of the players are partly undressed but most of them are too
exhausted to begin that process.  Trapper is stretched out on a
bench, apparently unconscious.  Henry enters triumphantly, waving
a thick stack of paper money.

		HENRY
	We got it, men...Ho-Jon's keep
	as Androscoggin...if there is such
	a place.  And the big news is, the
	General wants a rematch.

		TRAPPER
	I'll tell you my news.  I'm
	retiring from football.

		DUKE
	Me, too.  Y'all just seen me play
	my last game.

		HAWKEYE
	Same here.  You can retire my
	number.

		HENRY
	Well, there's one big satisfaction.

		SPEARCHUCKER
	What's that, Henry?

		HENRY
	I outcoached that General Hammond.

							TIME LAPSE:

130	EXT. FRONT OF 4077TH MASH - EVENING

A covered Army truck pulls up with the victorious football team
breaking the normal rule for hospital zones by singing a boisterous
old drinking song.  Several of them have bottles in their hands as
they descend to the ground.  Hawkeye and Duke are among the first
and the noisiest until they notice Lapham (the new surgeon we saw
the first time during the deluge) standing under the light at the
hospital entrance.  There is something in his expression that makes
them break off their singing abruptly.  Trapper and Spearchucker,
jumping down after them, react the same way, and their sudden
silence affects the others so that in a matter of seconds the
singing has died out entirely.  Hawkeye and Duke run toward the
hospital entrance, Trapper and Spearchucker a little behind them.

						BRIEF TIME LAPSE:

131	INT. AT HO-JON'S BEDSIDE - EVENING

Ho-Jon is unconscious.  Lapham holds an X-ray while Trapper scans
it.

		TRAPPER
	It's a massive one.

The X-ray is passed on to Hawkeye, Duke and Spearchucker in turn.

		SPEARCHUCKER
	Isn't he awful young...?

		TRAPPER
	That's the artery we sewed up last
	summer.  Had to end up smaller,
	that much easier for the thrombosis
	to occur.

Ho-Jon opens his eyes, slowly reacting to the pressure of all the
doctors.

		HAWKEYE
	Pain bad, Ho-Jon?

		HO-JON
	  (with considerable
	  effort)
	I - wouldn't - wish - it - on
	- a - man-eating - shark.

		TRAPPER
	  (to Lapham)
	More demerol.

Lapham goes off to get the medication.

		HO-JON
	You - must - open - me -
	up - again?

		DUKE
	No, Ho-Jon, we're not going to
	open you up.

Duke's words are intentionally ambiguous, and when Ho-Jon looks from
one doctor to another to find the real meaning of them, they all try
not to reveal it.  But he knows.

							TIME LAPSE:

132	INT. DENTAL CLINIC - DAY

Hawkeye and Trapper are in a stud poker game along with Painless,
Vollmer, Radar, a helicopter pilot and the Norwegian Officer we
saw playing before.  There is an entrance to the hospital visible
through a window, and an ambulance is parked outside it.

		VOLLMER
	Pair of sevens'll say a buck.

The ambulance driver and another soldier come out of the hospital
bearing a shrouded corpse on a stretcher.  Hawkeye, choosing not
to call the bet, turns over his cards, stands up restlessly and
sees the body on the stretcher.  Trapper, who has a view out the
window from the seat, also sees it, and the effect on him is to
take his attention momentarily from the game.

		PAINLESS
	Make it two.

The helicopter pilot folds his hand, and it's Trapper's turn to be
next.  Radar, who is dealing, waits a moment to see if he has to be
reminded,

		RADAR
	Two dollars to you, Trapper.

Ho-Jon's body is tossed into the back of the ambulance.  Trapper
checks his cards and turns them over.

		TRAPPER
	Sorry.  I'm out.

							TIME LAPSE:

133	EXT. MASH COMPOUND - NIGHT

Three months later, a cold winter night with snow on the ground.
Hawkeye, in a heavy sweater, is running toward the brightly lit
hospital.

134	INT. OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

Spearchucker is doing a brain operation with Duke assisting.
Hawkeye comes in excitedly but stops within a few feet of the
operating table because he isn't sterile.  He grabs a surgical
mask and holds it in front of his face as he speaks to Duke.

		HAWKEYE
	Henry's got our orders!  We're
	going home!

		DUKE
	When?

		HAWKEYE
	Any time.  Whenever we want.

		DUKE
	Be right with you.

		SPEARCHUCKER
	You mind if we get out of this
	guy's brain first?

		DUKE
	What's there to do?  You found
	the sliver.

		SPEARCHUCKER
	There might be another tiny piece
	we missed.  I want to look around
	before we close up.

		DUKE
	  (to Hawkeye, referring
	  to Spearchucker)
	Perfectionist.

He works the retractor he is holding to spread the incision while
Spearchucker probes it.

		HAWKEYE
	There's no transportation anyway
	this time of night.

		DUKE
	We could steal one of the choppers.

		HAWKEYE
	I looked.  Suspicious bastards
	got them all locked up.

							TIME LAPSE:

135	EXT. THE SWAMP - DAY

The next day, snow still on the ground.  Ugly John is at the wheel
of a Jeep into which Hawkeye and Duke are storing the same Valpacs
and barracks bags they arrived with more than a year before.  There
is a small group gathered to say goodbye, including Dago Red,
Lapham and Vollmer, who is Regular Army, but none of the others who
were part of the outfit when they first arrived.  When they are all
ready to take off, Hawkeye and Duke go back inside the Swamp.

136	INT. THE SWAMP - DAY

Trapper is drunk and gloomy, Spearchucker in fairly good spirits.
Duke pours small drinks into three glasses and adds some to the
drink Trapper is already holding.

		DUKE
	Y'all mind the store.

		TRAPPER
	Four goddam months.  And they
	don't even give you time off for
	good behavior.

		HAWKEYE
	  (shaking hands with
	  Spearchucker)
	See you.

		SPEARCHUCKER
	It's possible

		HAWKEYE
	  (extending hand to
	  Trapper)
	Hang in there.

		TRAPPER
	Why don't you for Christ's sake
	get the hell out of here?

And that's what they proceed to do.

							TIME LAPSE:

137	EXT. JAPANESE SEAPORT DOCK - DAY

A couple of days later.  Hawkeye and Duke are inspecting the
troopship on which they will make the long voyage to Seattle.
They have undergone a startling transformation: they have had
shaves and haircuts, and they have abandoned their fatigues
for clean, new-looking uniforms with Eisenhower jackets adorned
with their proper insignia, including a caduceus of the Medical
Corps.  There is a lot of activity on board the ship and on the
dock, where a MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT with a notebook accosts
them.

		MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT
	Excuse me, gentlemen, but are
	you sailing on the troopship
	tomorrow?

		DUKE
	That's right.

		MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT
	May I have your names, please?

		DUKE
	Sure, my...

		HAWKEYE
	  (overlapping)
	What for?

		MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT
	We need medical officers for short-
	arm inspection starting the first
	afternoon out.

		HAWKEYE
	Oh, certainly, Sergeant.  My name
	is Captain George Limburger, and
	this is Captain Walter Camembert.

		MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT
	  (writing)
	C-A-M-E-M...?

		HAWKEYE
	B-E-R-T, right.  See you tomorrow.

		MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT
	Oh, I'm not sailing with you.  I
	work out of the hospital here.

He salutes them and goes on his way.

		DUKE
	  (indicating his
	  shoulder insignia)
	I thought we were heading for trouble
	putting on all these trinkets.

		HAWKEYE
	We got to start rehabilitating,
	Duke, if we want to be halfway
	human by the time we get back to
	our wives.

		DUKE
	But no short-arm inspection.  I'm
	with you there.

		HAWKEYE
	Screw it.  We been earning our keep
	as respectable knife artists.  Why
	should we do work any pill-rolling
	punk could handle?

							TIME LAPSE:

138	EXT. HARBOR - DAY

The big troopship is making its way out of the harbor and heading
for open ocean.

139	EXT. TROOPSHIP - DAY

A SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT walks along the deck at the
officers' end of the ship.

		SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT
	Captain Limburger!  Captain Camembert!

All he gets in response are funny looks and laughter.  By the time
he comes near where Hawkeye and Duke are standing, the Sergeant is
beginning to wonder if there is something peculiar about the names
he is calling.  For added protection Hawkeye and Duke have replaced
their Medical Corps insignia with the simple cross of the
Chaplain's Corps.

		SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT
	Captain Camembert!  Captain
	Camembert!

		HAWKEYE
	Excuse me, Sergeant.

		SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT
	Yes, Reverend?

		HAWKEYE
	What do you want with those two
	medical officers?

		SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT
	They're supposed to hold short-
	arm inspection.

		DUKE
	You can't be serious, man.

		SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT
	Why not?

		DUKE
	The reason they're being shipped
	home is they're the two biggest
	fairies in the Far East Command.

		HAWKEYE
	Be the longest short-arm inspection
	you ever held!

		SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT
	Thanks, Reverend.  Thank you both
	for tipping me off.
	  (consulting list)
	You don't know a Captain Forrest
	or a Captain Pierce, do you?

		HAWKEYE
	They missed the boat.

		SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT
	  (making a note)
	Thanks.

		HAWKEYE
	Glad to help.

The Segeant goes off in one direction, Duke and Hawkeye in another.
Pretty soon they come across a dice game and stop to watch.

		DUKE
	This a closed game or you take
	anybody's dough?

A couple of the DICE PLAYERS look up and react adversely to the
Chaplain's Corps insignia.

		FIRST DICE PLAYER
	Well, almost anybody's.

		SECOND DICE PLAYER
	  (apologetically,
	  to Duke)
	Kind of a rough game, Reverend.

		DUKE
	Hell, man, that don't matter.
	We're loaded.  We were big wheels
	in the black market in Seoul.

		HAWKEYE
	Plus running the opium concession
	for the whole Eighth Army.

These confessions arouse the interest of all the players.  One, a
SIGNAL CORPS CAPTAIN, looks at them intently, then smiles.

		SIGNAL CORPS CAPTAIN
	They're not chaplains at all.
	They're doctors from the 4077th Mash.
	I had a piece of steel dug out of
	my back there.

The player who told them it was a rough game, an infantry captain,
extends his hand to greet them.

		SECOND DICE PLAYER
	Pleasure to have you.  Lot of my
	men went through your outfit.

		HAWKEYE
	Glad to know you.  Listen, we're
	ducking short-arm inspection but
	our cover isn't going to last
	long.  How would you two boys
	like to do us a favor? Be Forrest
	and Pierce of the Medical Corps
	between here and Seattle.

		SIGNAL CORPS CAPTAIN
	We wouldn't know how to go about
	it.

		HAWKEYE
	Nothing to it.  You just turn a
	chair around backwards and rest
	your chin on the top.  You sit
	there with a big cigar in your
	mouth and and every now and then,
	just to show you're looking, you
	say, 'Don't wave it so close to
	my cigar, soldier.'  That's all
	you do.  You can't go wrong.

							TIME LAPSE:

140	INT. U.S. CIVILIAN AIRLINER - NIGHT

It is March.  A STEWARDESS with a stern look appraoches Duke and
Hawkeye.  Duke is sucking on a bottle of scotch.

		STEWARDESS
	I've told you twice to put away
	that bottle.  Now I'll have to ask
	the captain to come back and speak
	to you.

		HAWKEYE
	Never mind your captain, honey.
	  (takes bottle from
	  Duke and puts it
	  away)
	I'll take care of mine.  Till we
	land in Chicago.

							TIME LAPSE:

141	INT. MEN'S ROOM - MIDWAY AIRPORT - CHICAGO - NIGHT

The bottle of scotch stands on a shelf over the wash basins.  Duke
is combing his hair, Hawkeye shaving.

		ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
	  (over loudspeaker
	  system)
	Flight 616 for Cincinnati,
	Knoxville and Atlanta, now
	boarding at Gate Five.

Hawkeye reaches for the bottle, hands it to Duke, who takes a sip
and passes it back.  Hawkeye kills it and throws it into a trash
can.

		DUKE
	Let's hear from you, you goddam
	Yankee.  Be nice to see you some
	time.

		HAWKEYE
	Like the Spearchucker said, that's
	possible.  Anyway, it's been an
	interesting association.

Duke picks up his bags and starts out.  Hawkeye resumes shaving.

							TIME LAPSE:

142	INT. ATLANTA AIRPORT - DAY

Duke is among the passengers entering the airport from an incoming
flight.  He spots his wife and two daughters, now three and one-
and-a-half.  He starts eagerly toward them but we never get a
distinct look at them.

							TIME LAPSE:

143	EXT. ROCKLAND, MAINE AIRPORT - DAY

Here incoming passengers can be met outside the terminal building.
Hawkeye disembarks from a Northeast Airlines Convair and sees his
wife waiting for him with their sons, aged five and three.  The
older one lets go his mother's hand, dashes out to his father and
jumps into his arms.

		FIVE-YEAR-OLD
	How they goin', Hawkeye?

		HAWKEYE
	Finest kind.

He looks toward his wife, but we don't see her in clear focus.

							FADE OUT
