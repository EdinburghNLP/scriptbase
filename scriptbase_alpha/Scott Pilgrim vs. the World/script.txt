          1 EXT. TORONTO RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY 1

          Snowy suburbs of Toronto. From a nondescript house we hear:

          KIM PINE (O.S.)
          Scott Pilgrim is dating a high schooler?

          2 INT. STEPHEN STILLS' KITCHEN - DAY 2

          Four twenty-somethings lounge around a small kitchen table.
          STEPHEN STILLS, 25, shaggy hair, Canadian Cowboy chic.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Really? Is she hot?
          KIM PINE, 22, cute, bitter, sweatshirt with a zipper.

                         KIM PINE
          How old are you now, Scott? Like
          twenty-eight?

                         SCOTT
          I'm not playing your little games.

                         KIM PINE
          So you've been out of high school
          for like, 13 years and-

          SCOTT (O.S.)
          I'm twenty-two. Twenty-two!

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          And you're dating a high school
          girl? Not bad, not bad.
          YOUNG NEIL, 20, simple mind, layered T-shirts.

                         YOUNG NEIL
          Like, did you guys 'do it' yet?
          SCOTT PILGRIM, 22, fresh faced and charmingly cocky with an
          unruly yet adorable mop of hair.

                         SCOTT
          We have done many things. We ride
          the bus. We have meaningful
          conversations about how yearbook
          club went and about her friends
          and, um...you know...drama.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Yeah, okay, have you even kissed her?

          she got embarrassed.

          Well. Aren't you pleased as punch?

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          So, what's her name?

                         SCOTT
          (pleased as punch)
          Knives Chau. She's Chinese.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          (under his breath)
          Chinese...
          Young Neil pauses his Nintendo DS.

                         YOUNG NEIL
          Wicked! How'd you meet her?

                         SCOTT
          I believe I mentioned the bus?
          Scott Pilgrim prepares to tell an amazing story:

          3 INT. THE BUS - NIGHT 3

          KNIVES CHAU, 17, cute and innocent with clothes to match,
          sits next to her mother, MOTHER CHAU, 45, demanding.

                         MOTHER CHAU
          You are seventeen year old! Time to
          get interested in boy!

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Mom!
          Knives DROPS her bag, books scattering everywhere.

                         MOTHER CHAU
          You drop book.
          Knives crouches down to pick up her books, grumbling.

          SCOTT (O.S.)
          Hey...
          Knives looks up to see the cute and gallant SCOTT PILGRIM
          holding her books. TEXT appears in an on-screen box:

          "SCOTT PILGRIM, 22 YEARS OLD, RATING: AWESOME."
          Stars appear in Knives's eyes. Scott grins heroically. Scott
          winks at Knives. Scott winks at the camera.

          4 INT. STEPHEN STILLS' KITCHEN - DAY 4

          Back in the kitchen, everyone looks at Scott...

                         KIM PINE
          Is that seriously the end of the story?

          Young Neil unpauses his Nintendo DS.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          So when do we get to meet her?

                         KIM PINE
          Oh please. Let it be soon.
          DINGY DONG! The doorbell rings. Scott smiles broadly.

                         SCOTT
          That's for me.

          5 INT/EXT. STEPHEN STILLS' HOUSE - DAY 5

          An eager Knives stands outside. Scott opens the door a crack.

                         SCOTT
          You promise to be good?

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Of course I'll be good!

                         SCOTT
          No, really. Please be good.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Am I normally not?
          Stephen Stills comes to the door and peers through.

                         SCOTT
          Oh, hey. Knives, this is Stephen
          Stills. He's the talent.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Hey.
          STILLS shuts the door on a confused Knives.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Is she gonna geek out on us?

                         SCOTT
          She'll just sit in the corner, man.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          I mean, I want her to geek out on us.

                         SCOTT
          She'll geek. She geeks. She has the
          capacity to geek.

          You're good.

          6 INT. STEPHEN STILLS' HOUSE - DAY 6

          Knives enters, looking around the rehearsal pad with awe:
          Bare bulb, ratty rug, drums, guitar, bass, LAME BRAND amps.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Wow.

                         SCOTT
          Knives, that's Kim. Lemme get your coat.
          Scott throws Knives' coat on the floor. Knives waves.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Hi, sorry, what was your name?

          KIM PINE (O.S.)
          Kim.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          You play the drums?
          REVEAL Kim sitting behind the drumset, sticks in her hands.

                         KIM PINE
          ...yes.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          That is so awesome.

                         SCOTT
          Knives, that's Young Neil.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Hi. What do you play?

                         YOUNG NEIL
          Uh, wow...Zelda...Tetris...that's
          kind of a big question.
          Knives stares blankly at Young Neil, who finally gets it.

                         YOUNG NEIL
          Oh. I'm not in the band. I just
          live here.
          Sex Bob-Omb has geared up. Amps hum to life.

                         SCOTT
          Let's start with Launchpad McQuack.

          AND BASS LEADS LEAP INTO THE AIR, SPELLING OUT OUR TITLE...

          SCOTT PILGRIM VS THE WORLD
          TITLES continue over the song as the small rehearsal space
          seems to GROW with the music. Stephen Stills barks
          unintelligable lyrics.
          Knives watches, jaw ajar. The song ends, feedback lingering.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          You guys...are so...amazing.

          7 EXT. BUS STOP - EVENING 7

          Scott bids adieu to a stunned Knives as she gets on a bus.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          I can't even...Sex Bob-Omb.
          Amazing.

          8 INT. STEPHEN STILLS' ROOM - EVENING 8

          The band and Young Neil lounge around Stephen Stills' room.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          She seems nice.

                         SCOTT
          Yeaaah.

                         YOUNG NEIL
          She seems awesome.

                         SCOTT
          Yeaaah.

                         KIM PINE
          Scott, if your life had a face I
          would punch it.

          I mean, are you really happy or are
          you really evil?

                         KIM PINE
          You? Hurt?
          Scott takes a breath, turns to Young Neil.

                         SCOTT
          Neil, you were saying she seems awesome.

                         YOUNG NEIL
          Yeah, she seems awesome.

                         SCOTT
          Yeaaaah...

          9 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - EVENING 9

          Scott hangs his coat up in a tiny, one room apartment. He
          turns to WALLACE WELLS, dark hair, arched eyebrow, disloyal.

          "WALLACE WELLS, ROOMMATE, 24 YEARS OLD, FUN FACT: HE IS GAY!"

                         SCOTT
          Before you hear some dirty lies
          from someone else, yes, I'm dating
          a 17 year old.
          Wallace looks up from the NOW magazine he's reading.

                         WALLACE
          Is he cute?

                         SCOTT
          Ha, ha, ha, ha.

                         WALLACE
          Does this mean we have to stop
          sleeping together?

                         SCOTT
          Do you see another bed in here?
          TINY BOXES OF TEXT indicate the ownership of the items in the
          one room flat: 95% belongs to Wallace, FUTON included.

                         WALLACE
          Yeah. You're totally my bitch forever.

                         SCOTT

          Wallace tosses the NOW magazine aside, starts texting.

                         SCOTT
          Who are you texting?
          RINGY RING. The phone goes. Scott picks up.

          STACEY (O.S.)
          Seventeen years old? Scandal!
          Intercut with STACEY PILGRIM, cute, peppy barista, gabbing on
          her cellphone in THE SECOND CUP. A sign behind her reads 'œIf
          you are using your cellphone, you will not be served'�.

          "STACEY PILGRIM, YOUNGER SISTER, 19, RATING: 'T' FOR TEEN."

                         SCOTT
          That's not true. Who told you?

                         STACEY
          Wallace. Duh.

                         SCOTT
          That gossipy bitch.

          WALLACE (O.S.)
          You know me.
          Scott turns to see Wallace on a second cordless.

                         SCOTT
          Wallace!
          Wallace clicks off. Scott sinks into an armchair.

                         STACEY
          Who is this mysterious child you date?

                         SCOTT
          Her name is Knives. Knives Chau.

                         STACEY
          A seventeen year old Chinese
          schoolgirl? You're ridiculous.

                         SCOTT
          It's a Catholic school too.

          Yeah, the whole deal.

          Oh my God, you haven't-

                         SCOTT
          No no no. We haven't even held
          hands. I think she hugged me once.

                         STACEY
          Um, Scott. Why are you doing this?

                         SCOTT
          I don't know...it's just nice, you
          know? It's just...simple.

                         STACEY
          It's been over a year since you got
          dumped by she-who-will-not-be-named.
          Scott glances down at the partially obscured NOW magazine,
          looking into the HOT GIRL'S EYES on the back cover album ad.

          STACEY (CONT'D)
          So, are you legitimately moving on,
          or is this just you being insane?
          Scott looks at a strip of photobooth pictures: he smiles next
          to a hot redhead in happier times.

                         SCOTT
          Can I get back to you on that?
          A SCHOOL BELL clangs loudly...

          10 EXT. CATHOLIC SCHOOL - DAY 10

          Wallace and Scott stand outside a CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL.
          Uniformed boys and girls pour out.

                         WALLACE
          I do not want to be here. At all.

                         SCOTT
          This school has boys too.

                         WALLACE
          I hate you. Even I would think twice
          about dating a seventeen year old.

                         SCOTT
          Well, she's only allowed out when
          the sun is up, so I wouldn't call
          it dating, more like...

          Knives skips to Scott. Her shy friend TAMARA lingers behind.

                         SCOTT
          Hey Knives, this is my cool gay
          roommate, Wallace Wells. He's gay.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Oh, hi! Do you want to know who in
          my class is gay?

                         WALLACE
          Yes. Does he wear glasses?

          Wallace, you go now! Begone!
          Wallace pulls Knives close. Whispers.

          You're too good for him. Run.

          11 INT. THE ARCADE - DAY 11

          Scott and Knives play NINJA NINJA REVOLUTION (think a martial
          arts version of DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION).
          They punch and kick in unison, side by side.

                         SCOTT
          Did you know the original name of Pac-
          man was Puck-man? You would think it's
          because Pac-Man looks like a yellow
          hockey puck, but actually it comes
          from the Japanese phrase paku-paku
          which means to flap ones mouth open
          and closed. They changed it over here
          because Puck-Man is too easy to
          vandalize. You know, scratch out the P
          and turn it into an F or whatever?
          Knives flips over Scott's back in a COMBO move.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Ohmigod, like...wow.

          Yeah. Wow.
          The game ends. CONTINUE appears, counting down: 10...9...8...
          Scott looks at Knives. She digs for quarters.

          Scott and Knives leave a pizza joint, slices in hand.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Tamara is into this Korean guy,
          Bobby, but everyone thinks Bobby
          has a crush on Mina.

                         SCOTT
          I thought Derek and Tamara had a
          mutual like-each-other thing going,
          what happened?

          A13 INT. THE GOODWILL - DAY A13

          Scott and Knives shop for T-shirts. Hangers click in time.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          I don't listen to much music. I
          know a lot of kids who play piano
          or whatever, but you guys ROCK.

                         SCOTT
          I knew I personally rocked, but I
          never suspected that we rocked as a
          unit. Thank you, Knives.

          Scott and Knives flip through records in perfect sync.

          I mean, you guys are gonna be HUGE.

                         SCOTT
          Well, we're already pretty big. But
          it might be cool if cool people
          wore our T-shirt.
          Knives speaks to a female clerk, surly with tats and specs:

          Oh, I heart them so much.

                         SCOTT
          I hearted them too until they signed
          to a major label and the singer turned
          into a total bitch and ruined my life.

          Uh. Let's talk about something else.
          The hiss of ball bearings catches Scott's attention. He

          The Rollerblading Girl delivers a package from AMAZON.CA to

          out of the library. Pensive guitar underscores his thoughts.

          20 EXT. TORONTO RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT 20


                         STEPHEN STILLS
          I told you like fifty times!
          Scott, Kim Pine, Stephen Stills and Young Neil walk down an
          icy Toronto street. Scott's head is still in the clouds.

                         KIM PINE
          We're going to this party, retard.

                         SCOTT
          Party?

                         YOUNG NEIL
          At Julie's.

                         SCOTT
          Ugh. I thought you guys split.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          We did. But, you know, there may be
          some label guys there, so...

                         SCOTT
          Aw, man. This is going to suck.

                         KIM PINE
          At least it will give us something
          to complain about.

                         SCOTT
          Awww maaan...

          21 INT. JULIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 21

          A bored Scott stands next to Young Neil in a very crowded
          house party. Both have red plastic cups in hand.

                         SCOTT
          ...this sucks.

                         YOUNG NEIL
          Sucks.

                         SCOTT
          I'm going to go pee due to boredom.
          Scott exits frame.

                         YOUNG NEIL
          I have to pee.

                         SCOTT

          Pretty much.

                         SCOTT
          Do you know this one girl with hair
          like this?
          Scott sketches an incomprehensible drawing of Ramona.

                         COMEAU
          Yeah man. Ramona Flowers. Someone
          said she was coming tonight actually.

          WHAT?

                         COMEAU
          You got the hots for her? I hear
          she's hardcore...
          Scott has already left a Scott-shaped dust cloud...

          22 INT. JULIE'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 22

          Scott scans the party. His eyes go WIDE. He CRUSHES his
          plastic cup. There she is...playing the wall...RAMONA! Aloof.
          Enigmatic. Hot. Scott sidles up and stands next to her.

                         SCOTT
          Hey, what's up?

                         RAMONA

          Well you know Pac-Man was
          originally Puckman but not because
          Pac-Man looks like a hockey puck
          and paku-paku-paku means flapping
          your mouth and they changed it
          because if you scratch out the "P"
          and turn it into an "F'�? You know?

          Yeah that's amazing.

                         SCOTT
          Um...am I dreaming?
          Ramona looks at Scott blankly. He slowly skulks away.

                         SCOTT (CONT'D)
          I'll leave you alone forever now.

          "THEN HE STALKED HER FOR THE REST OF THE PARTY..."
          Series of quick shots as Scott follows Ramona. He ducks
          around corners, spies from behind a much bigger dude. Ramona
          leaves the party. Scott grabs a startled Young Neil.

          He's not even conscious!

          Whatever. You of all people should know
          how sucky it is to get cheated on.

                         SCOTT
          Don't you have a job to do?

                         STACEY
          You're right. I should send out a
          mass text about this. Bye.

          package straight in the trash.

                         SCOTT
          Done. So, yeah. Eight o'clock?

          34 EXT. PARK - NIGHT 34

          Scott finds Ramona waiting at the top of some stairs in the
          park. The Toronto skyline gleams in the night behind them.

                         SCOTT
          Why are you just standing there?

                         RAMONA
          Dude, I'm totally waiting on you.

                         SCOTT
          Sorry, I just assumed you were too
          cool to be on time.

                         RAMONA
          Well. You assumed wrong.

                         SCOTT
          So what do you want to do? We could
          get a slice at Pizza Pizza or flip
          through some records at Sonic Boom.

          I'm cool with whatever you want to do.

                         RAMONA
          This is good.
          Scott and Ramona trudge through the snow in the empty park.

                         SCOTT
          This is good. So how'd you end up in
          Toronto?

                         RAMONA
          Just needed to escape I guess.

                         SCOTT
          Oh yeah?

                         RAMONA
          I got this job here. And Gideon had
          always said Toronto was one of the
          great cities so...

                         SCOTT
          Is Gideon...is he your boyfriend?

          He's...a friend.

          Was he your boyfriend?

          It's so not interesting to me.
          They sit on some swings in the park.

                         RAMONA
          So what about you? What do you do?

                         SCOTT
          I'm between jobs.

                         RAMONA
          Between what and what?

          My last job is a long story filled
          with sighs.

          Is that why you left New York?

          Pretty much. It was time to head
          somewhere a little more chilled.

          Well, it's certainly chilled here.

          Yeah.
          Uh. Chilled as in cold.

          Yeah.

                         SCOTT
          I'm totally obsessed with you.

                         RAMONA
          I didn't mean to get you obsessed.

                         SCOTT
          I just haven't been obsessed with a
          girl for a long time. It's weird.

                         RAMONA
          That's probably because you sleep
          with a guy.

          Actually... no... Wallace is pretty

          Dude, relax. I believe you. You're

          Laughing, Ramona hops off her swing.

          I'm... mostly stupid.

          I think 'act of God' is a pretty

          Scott shivers at the kitchen table of Ramona's cozy, girl
          friendly apartment. He watches as she slips out of her coat.

                         RAMONA
          What kind of tea do you want?

                         SCOTT
          There's more than one kind?

                         RAMONA
          We have blueberry, raspberry,
          ginseng, sleepytime, green tea, green
          tea with lemon, green tea with lemon
          and honey, liver disaster, ginger
          with honey, ginger without honey,
          vanilla almond, white truffle,
          blueberry chamomile, vanilla walnut,
          constant comment and earl grey.

                         SCOTT
          Did you make some of those up?

                         RAMONA
          I think I'll have sleepytime.

                         SCOTT
          That sounds good to me.

          Ramona exits. After a moment alone, Scott ventures upstairs.
          He wanders towards a half open door. Pushing it open, he
          finds Ramona in her bedroom in her bra and skirt.

          revealing black panties to complement black bra. Scott takes
          his shirt off. They tumble onto the bed and make out. Then-

          Scott goes white. He didn't even see Knives come in.

                         SCOTT

          HEYYYYYYYY!

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Hey.
          Knives pecks Scott on the cheek. He pushes her away. Knives
          looks kinda sexy, wearing makeup and new clothes.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Do you like?

                         SCOTT
          I...uh...
          LEONE STAREDOWNS all around. Stacey stares at Scott. Knives
          and Ramona stare at each other. Wallace stares at Jimmy.

          SCOTT (CONT'D)
          Have. To. Go.
          Scott scurries off. We hear feedback from a mic onstage.

          PROMOTER (O.S)
          This next band are from Brampton
          and they are Crash And The Boys.

          39 INT. THE ROCKIT, BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS 39

          Scott runs backstage to see Stills obsessively flipping
          through a chart with hand drawn stats of their rival band.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          This is a nightmare. Is this a
          nightmare? Wake up, wake up, wake up.

                         KIM
          Once we're on stage you'll be fine.

                         STILLS
          We were just on stage. For sound
          check. The sound guy hated us.

                         SCOTT
          It's just nerves! Pre-show jitters.
          People love us. Right?
          Scott sounds less than convincing. He looks up at Ramona and
          Knives sitting with Wallace, Jimmy and Stacey in the BALCONY.

          Jimmy. Do they rock or suck?

                         JIMMY
          They...haven't started playing yet.

                         WALLACE
          That was a test, Jimmy. You passed.

                         CRASH
          Good evening. I am Crash, and these
          are the Boys.

                         WALLACE

          IS THAT GIRL A BOY, TOO?

                         CRASH

          Crash and the Boys play a whole song in .04 seconds.

                         CRASH

          Wallace yells from the balcony.

          So, how do you know Scott?

                         RAMONA

          Hard for me to keep track
          sometimes. He has so many friends.

          MATTHEW PATEL lands onstage and glares at Scott through a
          lopsided fringe. He wears an evil grin and a jacket that
          borders on flamboyant. He drags on a cigarette (blacked out).

                         MATTHEW PATEL
          Mr. Pilgrim. It is I, Matthew
          Patel. Consider our fight...begun!

          Matthew Patel leaps in the air and sails toward Scott.

          What do I do?!

                         WALLACE

          FIGHT!
          Scott throws his bass to Young Neil and BLOCKS Patel with his
          left arm, then PUNCHES him across the floor with his right.
          Patel LANDS like a cat, FLIPS his fringe and GLARES at Scott.

                         MATTHEW PATEL
          Alright. Alright.

                         WALLACE

          Thank you, Wallace!
          Patel RUNS at Scott. Scott SPIN KICKS Patel in the chin and
          sends him flying into the air. They land in THE PIT, knocking
          hipsters down and squaring off in the resulting circle.

                         MATTHEW PATEL
          You're quite the opponent, Pilgrim.

          You will pay for your insolence!
          Patel attacks, landing kicks and punches. Scott evades and
          counter-attacks. Patel evades, then lands more punches. Scott
          jump-spins away from danger. They pause, breathing heavy.

          Patel attacks again. They exchange furious blows, until Patel
          puts Scott in a choke hold. Scott looks up to Ramona.

                         SCOTT
          You really went out with this guy?

          Yeah, in the seventh grade.
          The Lighting Guy SWINGS the spotlight to Ramona in the

          It was football season and for some
          reason, all the little jocks wanted
          me. Matthew was the only non-white,
          non-jock boy in school, probably in
          the entire state, so we joined
          forces and took 'em all out. We
          were one hell of a team. Nothing
          could beat Matthew's mystical
          powers. Nothing but pre-teen
          capriciousness. We only kissed
          once. After a week and a half, I
          told him to hit the showers.

          Patel SNAPS his fingers and launches into a BOLLYWOOD SONG!

          If you want to fight me, you're not
          the brightest. You won't know
          what's hit you in the slightest.
          Patel levitates into the air. Four hot girls in skirts with
          fangs and bat-wings appear in the air around him.

          MATTHEW PATEL (CONT'D)
          Me and my fireballs and my Demon
          Hipster Chicks, I'm talking the
          talk because I know I'm slick.
          Patel and the Demon Hipster Chicks shoot FIREBALLS at Scott.
          He flips back onto the stage, narrowly dodging the attack.

          MATTHEW PATEL (CONT'D)
          Fireball Girls! Take this sucker
          down.
          The Demon Hipster Chicks unleash more fireballs. Scott
          dodges. The house drum kit is trashed behind him.

          MATTHEW PATEL (CONT'D)
          Let us show him what we're all
          about.
          Scott hits the ground, dodging a third wave of fireballs.
          They explode Crash and the Boys in the wings.

                         SCOTT
          That doesn't even rhyme.
          Scott rolls across the stage, GRABS one of Kim's CYMBALS and
          throws it Captain America style. It hits Patel square in the
          eyes. POOF, the Demon Hipster Chicks vanish.

                         MATTHEW PATEL
          This is impossible, how can it be?!
          Scott leaps into the air. Patel opens his eyes just in time
          to see Scott Pilgrim's FIST racing towards his face.

                         SCOTT
          Open your eyes. Maybe you'll see.

          Well, it was great meeting you.
          Tell your gay friends I said bye.

                         STACEY
          Gay friends?
          Stacey turns to see Wallace and Jimmy making out.

                         STACEY
          WALLACE?! Not again!
          Ramona passes Knives, who is being resuscitated by Tamara.

          49 INT. THE ROCKIT, STAGE - CONTINUOUS 49

          Scott picks up the coins onstage and counts them.

                         SCOTT
          Aw man. $2.40? That's not even
          enough for the bus home.

                         RAMONA
          I'll lend you the 30 cents.
          Ramona yanks Scott away. The Promotor ambles back onstage.

                         PROMOTER
          Yeah...so like, Sex Bob-Omb wins.

          50 INT. THE ROCKIT, BALCONY - CONTINUOUS 50

          Knives is now wide awake, clapping wildly from the balcony.
          Her eyes scan the venue for Scott...but he is long gone.

          51 INT. THE BUS - NIGHT 51


                         SCOTT
          Sooooooo...
          A bemused Scott and mortified Ramona sit on the bus home.

                         SCOTT
          What was all that all about?

                         RAMONA
          Uh, I guess...
          Ramona takes a breath. Looks deep into Scott's eyes.

          RAMONA (CONT'D)
          If we're going to date, you may
          have to defeat my seven evil ex's.

                         SCOTT

          Defeat.

          we're going to continue to date.

                         RAMONA
          Pretty much.

                         SCOTT
          So, what you're saying is...

                         (BEAT)

          53 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - MORNING 53

          A bleary Wallace fries bacon. Scott bursts through the front
          door, a spring in his step. The studio audience applauds.

                         WALLACE
          Someone's happy.

                         SCOTT
          Well, someone got to second base
          last night. And someone has a
          second date tonight.

                         WALLACE
          Someone's lucky then.

                         SCOTT
          You know when I say '˜someone', I mean
          me, right? I got to second base last
          night...maybe first and a half.
          Wallace shoots a look at the idiotically upbeat Scott.

          SCOTT (CONT'D)
          Oh, hey, I'm inviting Ramona over for
          dinner, so you can't be here tonight.
          I don't want you gaying up the place.

                         WALLACE
          Okay, Scott. But in return I have
          to issue an ultimatum.

                         SCOTT
          One of your famous ultimatums?

                         WALLACE
          It may live in infamy...You have to
          break up with Knives. Today. Okay?
          Scott huffs and helps himself to some of Wallace's bacon.

                         SCOTT
          But...but...it's HARD.

                         WALLACE
          If you don't do it, I'm going to
          tell Ramona about Knives. I swear
          to God, Scott.

                         SCOTT
          But you...you're...
          At this point a sleepy JIMMY wanders out of the bathroom and
          helps himself to coffee.

                         JIMMY
          Morning.
          Scott points bacon at Wallace accusingly.

          SCOTT (CONT'D)

          DOUBLE STANDARD!

                         WALLACE
          I didn't make up the gay rulebook.
          If you have a problem with it, take
          it up with Liberace's Ghost.

                         SCOTT
          You're a monster.

                         WALLACE
          Now put the bacon down and go do
          your dirt while I watch the Lucas
          Lee marathon on TBS Superstation.

                         SCOTT

          They make movies in Toronto?

          Yes. I am stalking him later.

          You suck. Surprising no one.
          Scott grumbles off. Wallace turns the television way up. We
          see Lucas Lee on a payphone in some crummy thriller.

          LUCAS LEE (ON TV)
          Listen close and listen hard,
          bucko. The next click is me hanging
          up. The one after that...is me
          pulling the trigger.

          54 EXT. PAYPHONE ON BUSY STREET - DAY 54

          A shivering and annoyed Scott dials the payphone.

          Oh, hey, Knives. Um, do you want
          to, like, talk or whatever?

          KNIVES CHAU (O.S.)

          A beaming Knives knocks on the payphone glass.

          The SPOOKY MUSIC continues on in the record store.
          Scott is on edge as Knives geeks over a standee for THE CLASH
          AT DEMONHEAD: it features sultry blonde singer ENVY ADAMS
          posing and the rest of the band shrouded in shadow and mist.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          I can't believe they're coming to
          town. Will you take me to the show?

          Yeah, listen-
          The SPOOKY MUSIC gets louder, pounding inside Scott's head.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Oh, hey, I wanted to invite you
          over for dinner.

          Yeah. Well, to meet my parents.
          It's my birthday dinner.

                         SCOTT
          Uh...I think that's a really bad
          idea. Like, really, just so bad.

                         KNIVES CHAU

          (to Sex Bob-Omb)

          Believe it or not, I actually dated
          Scott in high school.

          Got any embarassing stories?

                         KIM PINE
          Yeah. He's an idiot.
          Scott fake laughs. Starts ushering Ramona out again.

                         SCOTT
          Okay. Cool. See you guys tomorrow.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Uh, what about rehearsal?

          58 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 58

          Ramona lounges, reading a magazine. A tense Scott hurries
          around the kitchen area, preparing food as Wallace looks on.

                         WALLACE
          Are you doing okay there?

                         SCOTT
          Yeah, good. Good.
          Ramona goes to the bathroom. Scott drops the act.

                         SCOTT
          She changed her hair.

          I know, but she changed it without
          even making a big deal about it.
          She's spontaneous. Impulsive.
          Fickle. Oh my god, what do I do?

                         WALLACE
          I can't believe you were worried
          about me gaying up the place.
          Ramona returns. Wallace pulls on a jacket.

          How's dinner coming along?

                         SCOTT
          Yeah, good. Good.

          I'll leave you lovebirds to it. I'm
          heading up to Casa Loma to stalk my
          hetero crush.
          Scott stops Wallace at the door, with a panicked whisper.

                         SCOTT
          Don't go.

                         WALLACE
          Will you man the hell up? You could
          get to 2nd and a half base.

          '15 MINUTES LATER'
          Ramona and Scott eat on the floor, picnic style. Scott has
          cooked garlic bread (and only garlic bread) for dinner.

                         RAMONA
          This is actually really good garlic bread.

          Garlic bread is my favorite food. I
          could honestly eat it for every
          meal. Or just all the time without
          even stopping.

                         RAMONA
          You'd get fat.

                         SCOTT
          No. Why would I get fat?

                         RAMONA
          Bread makes you fat.

          A nervy Scott serenades Ramona on his bass guitar.

                         SCOTT
          So I wrote a song about you.

                         RAMONA
          Oh yeah?

                         SCOTT
          Yeah, it goes like this: Ra-mona,
          Ra-mona, Ra-ra-ra, Mona, Ra-mona,
          Ra-mona, Ra-ra-ra, Mona, Ooooh.

                         RAMONA
          I can't wait to hear it when it's
          finished.

          Scott makes out with Ramona on the futon. Scott smiles as she
          runs her hands through his hair.

                         RAMONA
          Your hair's pretty shaggy.

                         SCOTT

          OH GOD! I NEED A HAIRCUT DON'T I?!?
          Scott sits up like a shot. Ramona is taken aback.

          Ha. No, sorry. It's just that I
          got... I got a bad haircut right
          before me and my big ex broke up. But
          it's so long ago, I can barely
          remember it...
          A deep voiced NARRATOR chimes in. Earl Jones deep.

                         NARRATOR
          Scott is acutely aware that his last
          salon haircut took place exactly 431
          days ago, three hours before his big
          breakup. He blames this largely on the
          haircut and has been cutting his own
          hair ever since.

                         RAMONA
          Sounds like a bad time.

                         SCOTT
          Not really.

                         NARRATOR
          It was.

                         SCOTT
          It was a mutual thing.

                         NARRATOR
          It wasn't.

                         SCOTT
          I mean, she told me it was mutual.

                         NARRATOR
          She dumped him. It was brutal.

                         RAMONA
          What was her name?

                         SCOTT
          She was Nat when I knew her. But
          she stopped liking that name.
          Then...she stopped liking me...

                         RAMONA
          Your hair is cute. I like it long.

                         SCOTT
          But it'd be cuter short! Wouldn't it?!
          Scott disappears and just as quickly reappears, now wearing
          his dorky SNOW HAT, hair tucked tightly beneath the flaps.

                         RAMONA

                         RAMONA
          Tell me we didn't come out here
          just so you could cover your hair
          with that hat.

          Nooo. I just love me some walking.
          Putting one leg in front of the other.

                         RAMONA
          You seem a little...heightened.

                         SCOTT
          Yeah. I don't know. I just, when I'm
          with you I feel like I'm on drugs. Not
          that I do drugs, unless you do, in
          which case I do drugs all the time,
          every drug, but...you make me feel...I
          don't know. Things seem a little
          brighter around you or something.
          Ramona and Scott finally reach the top of the stairs and
          NIGHT TURNS TO DAY, as if crossing a magical line.

                         LUCAS LEE
          Think you stand a chance against an
          A-lister, bro?
          Lucas Lee PUNCHES Scott again. He slides across the wet-down
          ground. A SET NURSE sprays Lucas' knuckles with antiseptic.

                         LUCAS LEE
          Some competish you are.
          Lucas Lee wanders off. Scott staggers to his feet, punchy.

                         SCOTT
          Hey... hey... hey! I'm not done-
          Scott spins Lucas around, only to find an identical STAND IN!

          LUCAS LEE (O.S.)
          Looks like you're seeing double.
          Scott turns to see the real Lucas, smirking on the sidelines.
          POW! The identical Stand In punches Scott to the ground.

                         LUCAS LEE
          He's good, right? Sometimes I let
          him do wide shots if I feel like
          getting blazed back in my winnie.
          Scott stands to fight the double. Suddenly, COUNTLESS
          STUNTMEN fan out behind the STAND IN, all identically
          dressed, all carrying skateboards and ready to rumble.

                         LUCAS LEE
          I'm nothing without my stunt team.
          The Stuntmen ATTACK Scott Pilgrim with a howl. Scott PUNCHES
          through a couple of the boards, Tae Kwon Doe style.

                         WALLACE
          Ask them how it feels to always get
          his sloppy seconds!

                         SCOTT
          How does it feel to-
          KROW! Scott takes a skateboard to the face, followed by a
          barrage of crippling skateboard blows to his knees and ribs.

                         LUCAS LEE
          I'm gonna get coffee. You homies
          want anything?
          We follow the smirking Lucas to the coffee station. We hear
          the noise of punching and kicking slowly subside to nothing.

          SCOTT (O.S.)
          Mr. Lee?

          Lucas turns, shocked to see Scott, in front of a PAINTED 2-D
          SKYLINE BACKDROP, surrounded by many unconscious stuntmen.

                         SCOTT
          You're needed back on set.
          Scott CHARGES Lucas Lee and leaps into a FLYING KICK. Lucas
          GRABS his foot and hurls him through the backdrop. RRRIP!
          Scott lands in a CRUMP, framed through the torn skyline.
          Lucas stomps over to him, preparing for the deathblow.

                         LUCAS LEE
          Prepare... prepare to feel the wrath
          of the League of Evil Exes!

                         SCOTT
          The League of Evil Axes?

          You really don't know about the
          "The League"?

          Ramona's love life?

          Oh, well then don't worry about it.

                         SCOTT
          Really?

                         LUCAS LEE
          Yeah, bro. Let's get a beer.
          Lucas offers a hand. Scott goes to shake it. POW! Lucas gets
          him square in the mouth. Scott smiles through his aching jaw.

                         SCOTT
          You are a pretty good actor.

                         LUCAS LEE
          I'm going for the Oscar this year.

                         SCOTT

          I'm more than pretty good, ese.
          I have my own skate company.
          Lucas pulls down his shirt, revealing a skate company tattoo.

                         SCOTT
          So you can sell them, but can you
          do a thingy on that rail?
          Scott points to the LONG HANDRAIL on the stairs.

                         LUCAS LEE
          It's called a grind, bro.

                         SCOTT
          So can you do a grind thingy now?

                         LUCAS LEE
          Are you serious? There's like 200
          steps and the rails are garbage.

                         SCOTT
          Hey, if it's too hardcore...

                         LUCAS LEE
          You really think you can goad me
          into doing a trick like that?

                         SCOTT
          There's girls watching.

                         LUCAS LEE
          Somebody get me my board.
          Wallace taps Lucas' shoulder and hands him his skateboard.

                         WALLACE
          Hi. Big fan.

                         LUCAS LEE
          Why wouldn't you be?
          CLACK! Lucas GOES FOR IT, a perfect ollie onto the rail.
          Scott and Wallace watch as Lucas disappears from sight,
          sparking down the ENDLESS RAIL...HSSSSSSSSSSSSSS...
          Cut back to Scott & Wallace, impressed at Lucas.

                         SCOTT
          Wow.

          Scott slumps on the couch, phone pressed to his ear. Wallace
          cooks bacon in the kitchen (no pants). We hear the OUTGOING
          MESSAGE: This is an automated voice messaging system. RAMONA
          is not available, please record your message after the beep.

                         (HANGS UP)
          What's the deal? Seriously.
          Scott ambles over to the fridge and rests his head on it.

                         WALLACE
          Yeah, you said that last night.

                         SCOTT
          You know what really sucks though?

          Wallace points to the NOTE Ramona scribbled which is pinned
          literally under Scott's nose on the refrigerator:

          Why does everything have to be so
          complicated?
          Wallace crouches down to join Scott on the floor.

          Lesbians?

          Okay, it's 'œlove'�. I wasn't trying
          to trick you or anything. Look, if
          she's really the girl of your
          dreams, then you have to let her
          know. You have to overcome any and
          all obstacles that lie in your
          path. You have the spirit of a
          warrior, Scott. You can do it! Be

                         (BEAT)
          Plus, I need you to move out.
          Scott's face falls, completely shocked at this bombshell.

                         SCOTT
          What? Why? Are you moving in with
          Other Scott or Jimmy or someone?

                         WALLACE
          Or someone. Either way, I'm kind of
          banking on her calling you back so
          I won't have to evict you and feel
          all guilty and shit.

          SHFFF - SOMETHING sweeps him off his feet. He's pissed now.

                         SCOTT
          I'm really not in the mood.
          SHWAA - SOMETHING slices the air in front of Scott.

                         SCOTT
          Okay, enough!
          Scott punches the air in front of him. Hits SOMETHING. A
          DIMINUTIVE DIRTY BLONDE dressed in a punk rock kung fu get up
          lands on the ground with a thump. She spins to face Scott.

                         MYSTERY ATTACKER
          You punched me in the boob. Prepare
          to die, obviously.

                         SCOTT
          Listen, I've had it today. Can we

          Okay little chicken, then I'll see
          you later. But you won't see me.
          Because I'll be deadly serious next

          Scott is in his usual payphone, dialing Stacey frantically.

          It's Scott.

          64 INT. THE SECOND CUP - CONTINUOUS 64

          Scott approaches the counter. Stacey has her back turned.

                         SCOTT
          Think I'll make it a decaf today.
          Stacey turns around, revealing herself to be JULIE!

          Stacey taps on the window outside, mouthing that she has to
          go. Scott turns back to Julie, not happy.

                         JULIE
          What can I fucking get you?

                         SCOTT
          Is there anywhere you don't work?

          They're called 'jobs', something a
          fuckball like you wouldn't know

          can't believe you fucking asked
          Ramona out after I specifically
          told you not to fucking do that!
          (Note to concerned reader: Everytime Julie says "FUCK", a
          black bar comes out of her mouth and the sound is bleeped.)

          RAMONA. They share an awkward moment. She looks at the floor.

          Sorry that got a little crazy last
          night.

          Yeah. You kind of disappeared.

                         RAMONA
          Yeah, I do that. Listen, I know
          it's hard to be around me
          sometimes. I'll understand if you
          don't want to hang anymore.

                         SCOTT
          No. No, I want to hang. The whole
          evil ex-boyfriend thing. No biggie.

          get in the way of how I SHIT!
          Scott hides behind Ramona as a lithe figure emerges from the
          steamed-milk mists of the coffee shop...the singer from THE

          A gig is a gig is a gig. Is a gig.
          Maybe you can put your history
          aside until we get through this
          thing. You know, for the band? For
          the band. For the band?

                         SCOTT
          Can't we do our own secret shows?

                         KIM PINE
          All our shows are secret shows.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          We're doing it. G-man might be
          there! We play the next round of
          the battle Saturday. We need to get
          some buzz going. We need
          groundswell. We need stalkers.
          Stills paces past the window to reveal...KNIVES CHAU OUTSIDE.
          CRASH ZOOM on her tearful face, pressed against the window.
          TOTALLY CRUSHED to see Scott cuddling with Ramona.

                         SCOTT
          What would you do? If your ex was
          in a band and they wanted you to
          open for them?

          Yeah.

                         RAMONA
          It might be a little awkward. But
          maybe it's the grown up thing to do.

                         SCOTT
          Yeah, we're all adults right?

          He only likes her cause she's old!
          She's probably like 25! She's just

          She's got a head start! I didn't
          even know there WAS good music
          until like two months ago! Okay,
          this really burns.

                         TAMARA
          We should rinse-

          I mean, he knew I was cool but he
          thought I was too young, so he
          tried to find someone cool but old.

                         TAMARA
          She's cool? I thought she was fat-

          Well she THINKS she's cool. This is
          all her fault.

                         TAMARA
          Why?
          Tamara turns the faucet on and rinses Knives hair.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          It MUST be her fault. Obviously
          it's just a twist of fate or
          whatever, isn't it? Star crossed

          Knives looks in the mirror: HER HAIR IS EXACTLY LIKE RAMONA.

          A huge line of TOO COOL YOUTHS snakes outside a rock venue. A

          We hear loud music blasting through the open doors.

          Wallace and Other Scott clap and cheer, drunk. The other

          "KNIVES CHAU, 17, SINGLE WHITE ASIAN" with identical hair,
          clothes and makeup, standing next to Ramona, looking hot.

          Knives heads into Young Neil's arms at the other end of the

          coat. Knives screams her teen brains out.
          The BASS PLAYER steps into the light, no longer shrouded in
          dry ice, he cuts a handsome, striking ROCK GOD figure.

          Young Neil escorts Knives out. Todd sits back down like
          nothing happened. Scott's face is a bright shade of rage.

                         JULIE
          So, are you guys doing anything fun
          while you're in town?

          FOR YOUR CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY!
          Scott LEAPS across the table and SWINGS a punch at Todd.
          Todd THRUSTS a hand out and telekinetically FREEZES SCOTT IN
          THE AIR. Scott hovers, grasping his neck, choking. Todd's
          hair magically forms into a FAUXHAWK.

          Todd telekinetically HURLS Scott through the club's wall!
          Ramona and Sex Bob-Omb peer through the newly made hole in
          the wall, to see Scott sprawled on some trash bags. He tries
          to keep cool, despite being in a lot of pain.

                         SCOTT
          No kidding...anyone can be...vegan.

                         TODD INGRAM
          Ovo-lacto vegetarian maybe.

                         SCOTT
          Ovo what?

                         TODD INGRAM
          I partake not in the meat nor
          breastmilk or ovum of any creature
          that has a face.

                         ENVY
          Short answer: Being vegan just
          makes you better than most people.

                         TODD INGRAM
          Bingo.
          Todd lifts up Scott telekinetically and throws him miles into
          the air. Scott sails out of shot and into space.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Hey man, question. I always
          wondered, how does not eating dairy
          products give you psychic powers?

                         TODD INGRAM
          You know how you only use ten
          percent of your brain? Well, it's
          because the other 90% is filled up
          with curds and whey.

          you knew the science, maybe I'd
          listen to a word you're saying.
          Scott returns to earth with a THUMP. He moans in pain. While
          the others bicker, Ramona helps Scott to his feet.

          backstory that can help me out in a
          critical moment of not dying? Yes.
          A brief, scrappy ANIMATED FLASHBACK of Young Todd and Ramona.

          RAMONA (V.O.)
          I was only dating Lucas until the
          minute Todd walked by. I guess
          that's not very nice, but I used to
          be kind of...like that.
          Young Ramona shoves Young Lucas down a hill and starts making
          out with Young Todd.

          RAMONA (V.O.)
          We hated everyone. We wrecked
          stuff. Nobody cared.
          Young Ramona and Young Todd wreck stuff. Nobody cares.

          RAMONA (V.O.)
          He punched a hole in the moon for
          me. It was pretty crazy.
          Young Todd punches a hole in the moon. It's pretty crazy.

          RAMONA (V.O.)
          A week and a half later, he told me
          his Dad was sending him to the
          Vegan Academy, so I dumped him.
          Does that help you at all?
          The FLASHBACK ends. Scott can only fixate on one aspect.

                         SCOTT
          Have you dumped everyone you've
          ever been with? You've never been
          the dumpee?
          Ramona shrugs.

                         RAMONA
          Look, I've dabbled with being a
          bitch. It's part of the reason I
          moved here. I was really hoping to
          put it all behind me.

          SCOTT stands in an elephant's graveyard of plastic cups and
          bottles, picking the hell out of his bass, amp pegged to 10.
          TODD INGRAM levitates, floating towards Scott with his bass.

          Scott slides across the floor and slams right into the wall.
          Todd LEVITATES, fauxhawk rising. He hovers next to him.

                         TODD INGRAM
          That's right, Pilgrim. I actually
          know how to play bass.

          I can read your thoughts. Your bass
          hand is badly injured. You're through.

                         RAMONA
          Are you okay?

                         SCOTT
          Uh huh.

                         RAMONA
          You sure about that?

                         SCOTT
          Do I look like I'm not okay?
          Scott does not look okay. Stills coughs.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          We're still going to the after show
          right?

                         KIM PINE
          I'm not sure it's gonna be much of
          a party, I think a third of the
          band just went 'œpoom'�.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Cool bands never go to their own
          after parties. It's just the
          desperate people trying to rub
          elbows with label guys.

                         KIM PINE
          Then why would we...oh.

                         STEPHEN STILLS

          Neil is at the counter with a catatonic Knives. He shrugs.

          Scott? You're in right?

                         RAMONA
          Do you want to go?

                         SCOTT
          I kind of almost died back there, so...

                         RAMONA
          I'm not saying I want to go.

                         SCOTT
          Hey, we can totally go.

                         RAMONA
          I'll do whatever you want to do.

                         SCOTT
          So let's go.
          Scott takes another bite. Other Scott whispers to Wallace.

                         OTHER SCOTT
          Are Scott and Ramona fighting?

                         WALLACE
          Not to my knowledge.

                         OTHER SCOTT
          Oh.

                         WALLACE
          I mean, not with fists.

                         OTHER SCOTT
          Oh.

                         WALLACE
          Yet.

          Ooh.

          81 EXT. AFTER PARTY - NIGHT 81

          The whole gang trudge to the after party. Scott limps a bit,
          lagging behind. Ramona falls back with him.

                         RAMONA
          We really don't have to go to this
          thing. It'll probably be a bad
          scene all around and we've already
          had a full night.

          Well, not that fighting harder and
          harder battles for your love is
          getting old or anything...but have
          you ever dated someone who wasn't a
          total ass?

                         RAMONA
          So far you're not a total ass.

                         SCOTT
          But I'm part ass?

                         RAMONA
          If it makes you feel better, you're
          the nicest guy I've dated.

          Wait...is that good?

          It's what I need right now.

                         RAMONA
          Scott, I don't have all the
          answers. I'd just like to live in
          the moment if I can.

                         SCOTT
          Yeah, I'd just like to live.
          Scott and Ramona enter a big, fartsy, artsy WAREHOUSE.

          Okay, I know Todd was bad news. But
          are you saying Envy wasn't? We all
          have baggage.

                         SCOTT
          My baggage doesn't try and kill me
          every five minutes. What did you do
          to your ex-boyfriends to make them
          so insane?

          No break up is painless. Someone
          always gets hurt. What about you
          and that girl Knives?

                         SCOTT
          Knives?

                         RAMONA
          Who broke up with who?

                         SCOTT
          I believe...I broke up with her.

                         RAMONA
          And was she cool with that?

                         SCOTT
          Knives is with Young Neil now,
          she's totally cool with it.
          They pass Knives and Young Neil. She seemingly has no
          interest in her date and simply stares at Scott lovingly.

                         RAMONA
          You sure about that?

                         SCOTT
          Yeah. She's very mature for her
          age. It was a very healthy break
          up. We're all peaches and gravy.
          We hear an offscreen distant '˜nooooo' from Knives.

                         RAMONA
          And what about you and Kim?
          They pass Kim. She's also staring at Scott. Not lovingly.

                         SCOTT
          Me and Kim? I can barely remember.
          Why, is it important?

                         RAMONA
          Hey, you want to know everything
          about my past, dude.

                         SCOTT
          It was just...yeah. I don't know.
          It was high school. She had
          freckles. It was cool, I guess.

                         RAMONA
          That's it?

                         SCOTT
          Yeah, it kind of ended. We changed.

          Scott and Ramona have reached the bar at the party.

                         RAMONA
          That's really the whole story?

                         SCOTT
          OKAY! I had to fight a dude to get
          with her! I fought a crazy eighty
          foot tall purple suited dude! And I
          had to fight 96 guys to get to him,
          too! He was flying and shooting
          lightning bolts from his eyes! He
          was totally awesome and I kicked
          him so far he saw the curvature of
          the earth! Does that make you feel
          any better?

                         RAMONA
          Well now you are being a total ass.
          Welcome to the club.
          In the back glass of the bar, Scott sees his reflection:
          fringed hair, wicked glare. He catches himself.

                         SCOTT
          Sorry. I'm not usually like this.

                         RAMONA
          Hey, don't worry. I don't know what
          I'm like anymore.

                         SCOTT
          I guess this whole ex-boyfriends thing
          is really messing with my head.

          Why do you keep saying-
          PAF! A foot appears out of nowhere and KICKS Scott in the
          head, sending him flying across the dance floor.
          Scott looks up at his opponent, the MYSTERY ATTACKER!

          It meant nothing???

                         RAMONA
          I was just a little bi-curious.

          Well honey, I'm a little bi-furious!
          Roxy throws a SCORPION KICK at Scott's face. Ramona CATCHES
          her foot mid-air. Roxy flips out of the hold.

                         RAMONA
          Do that again and I will end you.

          RAZOR SHARP FLYING GUILLOTINE BELT BUCKLE at Ramona! Ramona
          CARTWHEELS as the buckle sails between her legs and SMASHES
          into a DISCO BALL. Mirrored shards fly everywhere.
          PAF! Roxy vanishes as Ramona SWINGS the hammer at her. It
          smashes a speaker. Sound on one side of the room cuts out.
          Ramona turns around just in time to see Roxy's deadly belt
          SAILING towards her. She BLOCKS with the hammer. The belt
          wraps around it. Roxy HURLS the hammer out the window.

          towards Roxy and PUNCHING HER IN THE FACE. Roxy REELS and
          SLAMS into the wall, leaving a dent in it.

          ROXY (CONT'D)
          Your B.F's about to get F'd in the B!

                         RAMONA
          Her weak point's the back of her knees!

                         SCOTT
          What? How does that work?

                         RAMONA
          Whenever we were making out, I-

                         SCOTT
          Okay.
          As Roxy's leg descends, Scott reaches up with one finger and
          lightly TICKLES the back of Roxy's knee.

          GRAPHIC: 'œTICKLE TICKLE!'�

                         ROXY
          Oh...
          Roxy falls, still in the splits, throbbing with orgasmic
          meltdown. Scott watches as Roxy giggles between spasms.

          ROXY (CONT'D)
          You'll...never...be able to do this
          to herrrrrrrrrrr!
          Roxy screams in ecstasy before EXPLODING into COINS. A spent
          Scott is left standing in the middle of the room.

           Scott flushes red and retreats back to the bar. Ramona
           follows tentatively. The gossip echoes around them.

                          RAMONA
           Sooooo...

                          SCOTT
          Two gin and tonics please.

                         RAMONA
          I thought you didn't drink.

                         SCOTT
          Only on special occasions. Why? Did
          you want one?
          Scott swigs down his drink. Ramona tries to lighten things.

                         RAMONA
          I guess we really don't know that
          much about each other do we?
          Scott seems immediately drunk.

                         SCOTT
          Maybe you could just give me a list
          of all your exes so at least I know
          who's going to beat my ass into the
          ground next.

                         RAMONA
          Oh, like a handy little laminate or
          something? Let me see if I can find one.
          (looks through bag)
          Maybe we could exchange our information.
          Scott has already downed his second drink.

                         SCOTT
          Just out of sheer curiosity and
          concern for my mortal well-being,
          is there anyone at this party you
          haven't slept with?

          EVERY GUY AND GIRL AT THE PARTY

          HEY!
          Ramona stops. Looks hurt. She touches her hair.

                         RAMONA
          I really think we should split.

                         SCOTT
          As in '˜get out of here'? Or as in
          '˜split split'?

          How could I not? I feel like we just
          washed our sexy laundry in public.

                         RAMONA
          Dirty laundry. You're drunk.

                         SCOTT
          (holds up 2 fingers)
          I've had like one drink.

                         RAMONA
          Well I'm sorry I cared. I don't
          enjoy all this Scott. In fact I'm
          sick of it. I thought you might be
          more understanding.

                         SCOTT

                         I JUST-

                         RAMONA
          You're just another evil ex-
          boyfriend waiting to happen.
          Ramona walks off and loudly announces.

          RAMONA (CONT'D)
          And yes, there is someone at this
          party I haven't slept with. You.
          Ramona leaves. Another crescendo of gossip echoes around the
          room. Scott's friends gather round in a pity party.
          But then - Ramona returns, handing Scott a LAMINATED LIST.

          RAMONA (CONT'D)
          P.S. Here's your stupid list.
          Ramona exits proper. Scott looks at the list. It reads-

          'œPATEL, LEE, INGRAM, RICHTER, KATAYANAGI TWINS, GIDEON...'�

                         SCOTT
          Who the hell are the Katayanagi Twins?

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          You don't know?

          83 INT. STEPHEN STILLS' HOUSE - NIGHT 83

          Stills flips to hand drawn sketches of THE KATAYANAGIS,
          identical Asian twins dressed like pretentious New Wave fops.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          They're the next band in the battle
          and they are badass.

          We reveal a grim, terse Scott playing a doomy bassline. The
          rehearsal room feels empty without Knives or Ramona.

                         KIM PINE
          Ramona dated twins?

                         SCOTT
          Apparently.

                         YOUNG NEIL
          At the same time?

                         SCOTT
          You know what? I don't know and I
          don't want to know.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Good. You know how I feel about
          girls cockblocking the rock.

                         SCOTT
          Good. I play better in a bad mood.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          If it's gonna be an issue though,
          Young Neil can fill in for you.

                         SCOTT
          It's not an issue. You know bands,
          I know battles. We got it covered.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Well, we'd understand if you didn't
          want to take part.

                         SCOTT
          Not only do I want to take part. I
          want to take them apart.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Okay. I'm getting tingles.

          Sex Bob-Omb and Young Neil load their gear at the venue.

          Come on. You're onstage in five.

                         SCOTT
          Aren't the Katamaris or whatever on
          first?

          'œACTUALLY, NO'�
          Two stages sit on either side of the auditorium. On one: a
          MONOLITHIC WALL OF ELK AMPLIFIERS. On the other, SEX BOB-OMB,
          with their dinky LAME BRAND amps behind them.

                         SCOTT
          Okay. My bad.

                         KIM PINE
          Your bad is saying my bad.
          Sex Bob-Omb stare up at the Katayanagi amps, sweating behind
          their instruments. Stills looks into the audience positioned
          between the bands: a legion of identical INDIE TEENS.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          We shouldn't even be here. We
          shouldn't even be here.
          Stills tries to run. Scott grabs him and pulls him back.

                         SCOTT
          Come on man! I put aside my
          problems for the music. If I can do
          that, we can do anything.

                         KIM PINE
          Did you speak to Ramona then?

          hair is now the BRIGHTEST GREEN, and she stands next to a
          nondescript MYSTERY GEEK in blazer and black rimmed glasses.
          They are chatting. She looks happy. Scott turns bleak again.

                         KIM PINE
          Scott? Not that I care...but you should
          talk to her before she's gone...

          Scott nods at Kim's advice. He looks back to the crowd to
          find the MYSTERY GEEK staring right at him. Then-
          Disorienting LIGHTS and LASERS flash on the opposite stage.
          A wall of FEEDBACK builds...THE KATAYANAGI TWINS appear,
          sliding onstage behind their respective keyboard stands.
          KYLE KATAYANAGI, 23, is very serious and Japanese. KEN

          Okay gang. Can we do this? I mean,
          we can do this. Right?

          Kyle Katayanagi hits a SINGLE NOTE on the keyboard, blasting
          an enormous wave of sound at Sex Bob-Omb. It's so loud that
          it shakes the foundations and rips the lighting rig from the
          ceiling, leaving a huge hole in the roof. The crowd cheers.

          AUDIENCE DUDE (O.S.)
          They brought the house down.
          Now an open air venue, SNOW falls onto the stage. An earth

          towards the Katayanagis. For once, they sound awesome.
          Kyle looks at Ken. They share a nod. Ken turns their amps up
          to the Japanese character for 'œ11'�. Their waveforms transform
          the swirling snow into a TWO HEADED WHITE DRAGON!
          Katayanagi SLAM their Moogs. Heavy weirdness EXPLODES from
          the amps! The Dragon blows a BLAST of snowy fire that BLOWS
          SEX BOB-OMB OFF THE STAGE. The crowd ERUPTS into cheers.

          Stills points to the 'œMystery Geek'�, who smirks and whispers
          in Ramona's ear. This is GIDEON GRAVES, 37, ASSHOLE.

                         SCOTT
          That's Gideon?
          Scott's eyes reflect Ramona's hair and turn GREEN. He
          struggles to his feet. The crowd slowly stops clapping as
          Scott pulls Stills to his feet, then helps Kim up.

          That...was epic.
          The crowd goes bazooky. A DISEMBODIED SCOTT HEAD appears,
          hovering next to Scott.
          Scott looks for Ramona in the crowd, but she and Gideon are
          gone. Scott hands his bass to Young Neil.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Scott. What are you doing?

                         SCOTT
          Getting a life.
          Scott swipes the SCOTT HEAD and jumps into the still-
          applauding crowd. He can't find Ramona, but comes upon KNIVES
          standing alone in her homemade Sex Bob-Omb T-shirt.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          I just came to see the show. I'm
          not even stalking you.
          Knives's unusally composed demeanor gives Scott pause.

                         SCOTT
          You seem... different.
          Knives shrugs, different.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          I feel like I know stuff now.
          Scott and Knives lock eyes. Scott suddenly spots a flash of
          GREEN HAIR exiting the building.

                         SCOTT
          Ramona...
          Scott follows. Knives watches him go, eyes narrowing.

          Scott chases Ramona down the street outside the venue.

          Great. Listen, I know you just play
          mysterious and aloof to avoid
          getting hurt. I know you have
          reasons for not wanting to talk

          A sleek black '˜61 Lincoln Continental pulls up behind.

                         RAMONA
          It's Gideon. I just...I can't help

          That's the bad news.
          GIDEON GRAVES appears behind Scott with Stills and Kim in
          tow. The Lincoln parks. A driver opens the passenger door.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          The good news, Scottie, is I'm
          officially loving the Sex Bombs.

          You think we're gonna sell our
          souls to you? Well then guess-
          We hear SCRIBBLING. Stills has picked up the contract and is
          furiously signing it using Scott's back. Kim shrugs and signs
          it too, before trying to hand it back to Scott.

                         SCOTT
          Nuh-uh. I can't be part of the band
          with this douche-in-charge.

          Scottie, buddy, can I just say,
          keep your emotions in check. Don't
          let what's past screw up your
          future.
          Scott watches Ramona get into the Continental. She rolls the
          mirrored window up so Scott stares at his own reflection.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          The people need to hear us, Scott.

                         SCOTT
          Then you're going to need to find
          someone else to play bass.
          A cough. A meek Young Neil slides into view, bass in hand.

                         GIDEON
          Looks like we're all set.
          Young Neil signs the contract. There are hand shakes all
          round. Gideon turns to Scott and pats him on the shoulder.

                         GIDEON
          Oh and Scott, we should really be
          thanking each other. I mean, if it
          wasn't for me, you would have never
          been with Ramona, but if it wasn't
          for you, she wouldn't be back with
          me. So I guess it all shakes out.
          Gideon walks around to the driver side of the Lincoln.

                         GIDEON
          And hey, the whole League of Evil
          Exes thing? I was in a dark place

          Password?
          Scott shrugs.

                         SCOTT
          Whatever.

                         HIPSTER KID
          Cool.
          The Hipster Kid waves Scott in.

                         

                         

                         

                         

           INTEGRATED FINAL 104A.

          93 INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT 93

          The warehouse is empty. Scott follows the sound of music to a
          GATED ELEVATOR. Two Hipster Kids guard the elevator.

                         HIPSTER KID
          Second password?
          Scott gives the slightest shrug.

                         HIPSTER KID
          Cool.
          Scott steps into the elevator. So far so good.

          94 INT. CHAOS THEATRE - CONTINUOUS 94

          Scott exits the elevator and steps into GIDEON'S UNDERGROUND
          LAIR OF COOL SHIT...the CHAOS THEATRE.
          All HIPSTER KIDS have gathered in one spot of ultimate
          snobbery. They are legion, wearing identical outfits; Chuck
          Taylors, skinny jeans. COMEAU holds court among them.

                         COMEAU
          Yeah, their first album is so much
          better than their first album.
          Scott pushes through the idiot hordes. SEX BOB-OMB are
          playing onstage, now using SWEET BRAND amps, YOUNG NEIL on
          bass. Stills sees Scott walking by as they finish a song.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Scott!
          Scott pauses, looking up at his former bandmates.

          STEPHEN STILLS (CONT'D)
          Let it go. Don't give him the
          satisfaction.

                         SCOTT
          What if I want the satisfaction?

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Well, then you're doomed.

          GIDEON GRAVES (O.S.)
          Scott Pilgrim!
          Scott turns to see GIDEON sitting on a throne of cool atop a
          BLACK VELVET VIP PYRAMID. Ramona kneels at his side.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          Hey buddy, welcome to the Chaos
          Theatre. Somebody get this man a
          drink! Coke Zero right?
          A COCKTAIL WAITRESS with a fringe appears with a Coke Zero.
          Scott takes the beverage and THROWS THE CUP TO THE FLOOR!

                         SCOTT
          I'm not here to drink.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          I got no beef with you.

          You mean 'œThe League'�?

                         GIDEON
          Guild, League, whatever. It's
          ancient history.
          Gideon puts his arm around Ramona.

                         SCOTT
          I'll show you how ancient of
          history it is.
          Scott gets into a fighting stance. Gideon loses his cool.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          No use crying over spilt Coke,
          buddy. The lady made her choice and
          we're all gonna have to move on.

                         SCOTT
          Well I ain't moving...buddy.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          You want to fight me for her?

                         SCOTT
          Was that not clear?
          (to Sex Bob-Omb)
          Was that not clear?
          Sex Bob-Omb shake their heads. Gideon stands up, flexes.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          Now why on earth do you want to do that?

                         SCOTT
          Because, I'm in love with her.
          Ramona and Scott lock eyes. A new power comes over Scott. He
          reaches for the HEART DESIGN printed on his ratty vintage T-
          shirt and pulls a FLAMING BLUE SWORD from his own chest.

          NARRATOR (V.O.)
          Scott earned the power of love...
          Ramona looks away from Scott. Gideon smiles.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          I think this deserves a song.

          We are Sex Bob-Omb, we are here to
          make money, and sell out and stuff.
          Kim clicks out a fast tempo. Sex Bob-Omb begin to ROCK OUT.

          A HORDE OF HIPSTER INDIE KIDS ATTACK SCOTT PILGRIM, ON BEAT.
          Scott swings at them with his FLAMING BLUE SWORD. He slashes
          at them to the beat, exploding each attacker into COINS.
          Scott then RUNS up the side of the pyramid towards Gideon.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          Ramona. My cane.
          Ramona hands Gideon a cane with G-MAN engraved on the handle.
          He unsheathes a SWORD that could not have fit in there.
          Scott and Gideon LEAP towards each other...Gideon descends
          like a vulture and SMASHES the sword out of Scott's hands.
          Scott hits the ground HARD, rolling to a stop.

                         SCOTT
          Your club sucks, by the way.
          Gideon approaches, to administer a final blow.

                         GIDEON
          If my cathedral of cutting edge
          taste holds no interest for your
          tragically Canadian sensibilities,
          then I shall grant you a swift exit
          from the premises. And fast
          entrance into HELLLLLLL.
          Gideon raises his sword. Then from above...

          KNIVES CHAU (O.S.)

          SCOOOOOOOOOTT!!!
          KNIVES CHAU sails into frame and KICKS the sword out of
          Gideon's hands. She lands awkwardly, tripping and falling
          down the side of the pyramid. Gideon chuckles.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          That is priceless.
          Scott looks to Knives, both concerned and amazed. She quickly
          recovers and POINTS a furious finger.

          Knives pulls out KNIVES and charges! Ramona fights
          defensively, redirecting Knives' parries without harming her.

          You can't say I don't know how to
          put on a show.
          GIDEON lashes out at Scott. He can barely block Gideon's
          tremendous blows, distracted by his duelling exes.

                         RAMONA

          the edge of the pyramid. He then BLOCKS a punch from Knives
          to Ramona and spins her away, separating them.

          Alright... the truth is, it was me

          ...AAAAAAAAAHHH! I CAN'T BELIEVE I

          HAD TO SEE THAT AGAIN!

          SOME GUY (O.S.)
          Again?

          WALLACE (O.S.)
          Turn off the light!
          Scott flicks the light off. On PITCH BLACK...

                         SCOTT
          Wallace, when my journey began, I
          was living in an ordinary world.
          Ramona skated through my dreams and
          it was like a call to adventure, a
          call I considered refusing. But my
          Mentor, that's you, told me if I
          want something bad enough I have to
          fight for it. So I did. There were
          tests, allies, enemies. I
          approached a deep cave and went
          through a crazy ordeal, during
          which I totally seized the sword.
          Sadly, I died. Then I resurrected!
          Now I realize what I should have
          been fighting for all along. But
          before I do that, I need to ask one
          final favor of you.

          WALLACE (O.S.)
          Sure thing, guy.

                         SCOTT
          Could you put a robe on and hand me
          the phone?
          Wallace flicks on a bedside lamp, hands him the phone.

          Scott. I was just about to-

                         SCOTT
          Hey, pal. I feel terrible about
          everything. I don't want any hard
          feelings, so I figure why not be
          the bigger man and give you a call.

          Scott Pilgrim RUNS towards the desolate WAREHOUSES. The same
          HIPSTER KID smokes a cigarette against the wall.

                         SCOTT

          Neil? You have learned well. From

          Kim looks at Scott, deadpan as ever.

          Scott turns to GIDEON on his throne, Ramona at his side.

          GIDEON GRAVES (CONT'D)
          Hey buddy, welcome to the Chaos-

                         SCOTT
          Save it. You're pretentious, the club
          sucks, I have beef, let's do it.
          Scott goes straight into fight mode.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          You want to fight me for her?
          Ramona and Scott lock eyes. A strange new power overcomes
          Scott, different than before.

                         SCOTT
          No...I want to fight you for me.
          Scott reaches for the HEART DESIGN printed on his ratty T-
          shirt and pulls a FLAMING RED SWORD from his own chest.

          FLAMING RED SWORD, exploding each attacker into COINS.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          Ramona. My cane.
          Ramona hands Gideon his cane. He unsheathes his SWORD. Scott
          and Gideon RUN towards each other, LEAPING in the air. They
          pass in the air and Scott SLASHES. They land on opposite
          sides of the platform, backs to each other.

                         SCOTT

          Knives SAILS through the air and KICKS Ramona in the head
          SUPER HARD. We hear a METALLIC KLONK.
          They square off, Ramona staggered, Knives pulling KNIVES.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Steal my boyfriend, taste my steel.
          Scott jumps between them, hands held out.

          SCOTT (CONT'D)

          ENOUGH!
          Knives tries to go around him. Scott GRABS her wrists. She
          kicks him in the face.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          No, Scott! This fat ass hurt me and
          I will have my revenge!

          No, Knives. I hurt you. I cheated
          on you.
          Knives steps back, stunned.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          You cheated on me Scott?

                         SCOTT
          I cheated on both of you. And I'm
          sorry. I was a different guy back
          then.
          Knives' frown melts. Scott turns to Ramona.

          And...you're not a fat ass. She didn't
          mean that. So, are we all good?
          Ramona rubs the back of her head. The CHIP no longer blinks.

          Never felt better.

          and learning? I thought we had a

          All turn to see GIDEON; bloodied, but still grinning, a
          lopsided slash across his face accentuating his smirk.

          Wrong move, baby.
          Scott ATTACKS with his sword. Gideon BLOCKS, disarms Scott
          with one move, spins and BUTTS Scott in the face with the
          hilt of the sword. Scott teeters on the edge of the pyramid.
          Knives throws her knives. Gideon's lightning fast sword
          deflects them, SHING SHING!
          Gideon wheels towards Ramona, expecting her to move. She
          looks doubtful, takes a hesitant step towards him. He grins.

          GIDEON (CONT'D)
          Yeah. You're still my girl.
          Ramona steps up to Gideon and whispers in his ear.

          Ramona knees Gideon in the balls.
          Gideon SWINGS his sword at Ramona. Knives whips off her
          scarf, uses it to wrap up Gideon's sword arm and disarms him.
          Scott and Knives punch Gideon in the face in a volley of

          FREEZE FRAMES.
          Knives KICKS Gideon in the stomach and Scott follows with a
          PUNCH IN THE NOSE, sending Gideon sliding across the floor.
          Gideon gets back to his feet via backflip. He shakes off the
          assault and grins.

                         GIDEON
          You made me swallow me gum. That's
          going to be in my digestive tract
          for seven years!
          Gideon throws a series of Wushu moves that give him a POWER
          UP - his glasses glow, his HEALTH BAR increases. He makes an
          'œX'� with his fingers and a draws a NEW POWER UP SWORD.
          He cuts big arcs at Scott, Knives and Ramona. They barely
          dodge him. Scott SPIES his sword and picks it up just in time
          to BLOCK Gideon's attack. The swords create an 'œX'�.
          Ramona KICKS. Gideon BLOCKS, knocking her down.
          Gideon swings at Scott. Scott ducks. Knives attacks and
          scores a hit. Gideon hits her back, dropping her.
          SCOTT ATTACKS. They fence. Gideon spins low. Scott leaps in
          the air. Gideon spins again and swings upward. Scott blocks
          with his sword and is sent UP into the air. Gideon jumps
          after him. They CLASH in the air. Scott's sword SHATTERS.

          sword for the kill. Ramona swings Gideon's VELVET ROPE,
          cancelling out Gideon's digital sword.
          Gideon SLAPS Ramona in the face and sends her painfully
          tumbling down the pyramid. She lands painfully at the bottom.
          Knives and Scott share a look. They Get up and circle Gideon.
          COMBO ATTACK! FREEZE FRAME PUNCHES: Knives kicks and Scott

          impact.
          Ramona rises to see Scott and Knives kicking ass.
          Scott slides Knives through Gideon's legs. From the floor,
          she kicks him in the back of the head, then upends him like a
          wheelbarrow and KICKS HIM IN THE FACE, sending him spinning.
          Gideon lands HARD on his knees, defeated. One lens of his
          glasses cracks. He looks up at the steely eyed Scott.

          Gideon's head EXPLODES, his glasses SAILING down the steps of

          The glasses GLIMMER. GIDEON'S VOICE echoes.

          GIDEON'S VOICE (O.S.)
          You can defeat me...but can you
          defeat...yourself?
          Scott peers into the glimmering lenses, spotting his EVIL
          MIRROR IMAGE staring back at him. The glasses dissolve and
          Scott whips around to face...

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Negascott!
          NEGASCOTT walks towards Scott, Knives and Ramona. Fringed
          hair. Dark clothes. Evil face.
          Knives and Ramona flank Scott in a fighting stance.

                         SCOTT
          No. This is something I have to
          face on my own.
          The girls reluctantly exit stage left as Scott walks forward
          to confront his dark side.
          Scott and Negascott face off. Both take a step forward...

          100-103 OMITTED 100-103

          104 EXT. THE WAREHOUSE - EVENING 104

          Knives and Ramona huddle in the snow outside Chaos Theatre.
          They look expectantly at the entrance, worried for Scott.
          Then...
          Scott strolls out with Negascott. They chat amiably, shake
          hands and part ways. Scott approaches Knives and Ramona.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          What happened?

                         SCOTT
          Aw, nothing. We just shot the shit.
          He's a super-nice guy. We actually
          have a lot in common.
          Scott runs his fingers through his hair.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Your hair.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          It's getting really shaggy.
          Scott's HAT appears on his head! He looks totally freked.

                         SCOTT
          Yeah?

                         KNIVES CHAU
          I like it.
          Knives removes the hat from Scott's head, literally taking
          his guard down. Ramona sees this and smiles.

                         SCOTT
          You do?
          Scott smiles, then realizes Ramona has gone. He turns to see
          her, pulling her hood up and walking into the darkness.
          Scott calls after her. Steps tentatively away from Knives.

                         SCOTT
          Hey... Where are you going?
          Ramona, hoping to slip away, stops and turns back.

                         RAMONA
          I dunno. I should probably
          disappear.

                         SCOTT
          After all that?

                         RAMONA
          It's hard, you know? I came here to
          get away, but the past keeps
          catching up. I'm tired of people
          getting hurt because of me.
          Ramona looks at Knives as she says this.

                         SCOTT
          I think I understand.
          Snow begins to fall. Ramona straightens his parka tenderly.

                         RAMONA
          I should tahnk you, though.

                         SCOTT
          For what?

                         RAMONA
          For being the nicest guy I ever
          dated.

                         SCOTT
          That's kind of sad.

                         RAMONA

                         (ALMOST LAUGHING)
          It is kind of sad.
          She takes his hand briefly, then lets it drop.

                         RAMONA
          Well... Bye and stuff.

                         SCOTT
          Yeah. And stuff.
          She turns to walk off again. Scott watches, then hears-

          KNIVES (O.S.)
          Go get her.
          Surprised, Scott turns back to see a smiling Knives.

                         SCOTT
          Wha?

                         KNIVES
          You earned it. You've been fighting
          for her all along.

                         SCOTT
          But what about you?

                         KNIVES
          (totally sweet and sad)
          I'll be fine. I'm too cool for you
          anyway.
          She grins and kisses his cheek.

                         KNIVES
          There's someone out there for me.
          We hear a COUGH - Young Neil sidles into frame behind her.
          Guitar still in hand.
          We hear a 2ND COUGH - Nega Scott also sidles into frame.
          Knives doesn't look back, but urges Scott to-

                         KNIVES
          Go talk to her. Before she's gone.
          Ramona walks on into the night alone, but then-

          SCOTT (O.S.)
          Hey... mind if I tag along?

                         (CONTINUED)

          Ramona is flabbergasted to see a cheery Scott walk alongside.

                         RAMONA
          You want to come with me?

                         SCOTT

                         (HOPEFUL)
          I thought maybe we could... try
          again?
          Ramona smiles. She holds out her hand like in the park scene
          earlier. Scott takes it.
          We see the door with the star on it, standing right in the
          middle of the street, snow swirling around it.
          Scott and Ramona walk towards the door, sunrise coming up
          over Toronto, night magically turning to day, winter turning
          to spring.
          Over this magical transformation, we hear a lush rendition of
          '˜Ramona' swelling and hear whispers of gossip over Toronto's
          cell phone airwaves.

          JULIE (V.O.)
          Oh my God, can I blow your mind?
          Scott Pilgrim totally threw down
          with Gideon Graves at the grand
          opening of Chaos Theater. Yeah, it
          was apparently awesome.

          STACEY (V.O.)
          Oh my God, it was a HUGE fight. I
          mean bananas. My little brother
          kicked a guy's head off. Literally.
          It was unbelievable. Someone
          seriously should have been filming
          it.
          Scott and Ramona walk through the door. Tilt up to the
          heavens and reveal the CONTINUE graphic in the stars.
