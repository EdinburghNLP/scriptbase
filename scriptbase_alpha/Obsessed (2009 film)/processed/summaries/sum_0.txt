Derek Charles is a hard working man, employed as a asset manager in a private company.
He is very happy with his beautiful wife, Sharon, and only son, and because of his hard work he just got a huge promotion.
But suddenly he gets a temporary worker who is both attractive and smart, and Derek is understandably impressed with her and also finds himself physically drawn to her.
However, this new girl is desperate to get close to him - at any cost.
