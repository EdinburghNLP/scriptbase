                                   Written by

                Chris Provenzano, Scott Seeke &amp; C. Gaby Mitchell

                         

                         

<b>          1 EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT 1
</b>
          From a distance and through the trees we see a raging hell
          fire engulfing a small two story house. It burns and burns.
          Out of nowhere a man bursts through a second story window,
          lands hard and rolls to smother his burning clothes.
          He crawls away and staggers up and for a moment looks as if
          he might run back into the flames. But the heat is
          unbearable. He runs toward us then past us through black
          shadows. We cannot see his face,

<b>          1A EXT. WINDOW - EARLY MORNING (WINTER 1930S) 1A
</b>
           Glass in a weathered window glitters with early morning sun.
           A rock shatters one of the remaining glass panes!

<b>          2 EXT. YARD - EARLY MORNING/CONTINUOUS 2
</b>
           The rock thrower, TOM ( 10) is hightailing it away from an
          isolated Appalachian SHACK as the door bangs open, a shotgun
          barrel appears, and a chicken comes SQUAWKING out from under
          the porch!
          Thinking he's sure to be shot, Tom runs into the old barn!

<b>          3 INT. BUSH'S BARN - EARLY MORNING/CONTINUOUS 3
</b>
          Panting in terror, Tom is hunkered down in strips of light,
          trying to see through the cracks. There is a loud SNORT and
          the huge face of some kind of beast suddenly appears at his
          shoulder.
          Tom jumps, panicked, just as a SHADOWY FIGURE creeps into the
          barn and levels a glinting shotgun at him!
          Tom freezes, bends over, and throws up!
          When Tom looks up, a ray of light reveals the half face of a
          fierce gray bearded man, FELIX BUSH. He is holding out a
          handkerchief to the boy. Shaking hard, Tom hesitates then
          takes it and wipes his mouth.
          Bush pushes open the door and gives Tom a sad look that the
          boy will never forget before waving him away.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          2.
</b>
<b>          4 EXT. BUSH'S BARN - MORNING 4
</b>
          Looking back over his shoulder, Tom runs for the road. Two of
          his BUDDIES are already kicking up dust.
          BUSH (72) steps into the sun and watches the boy run off with
          a look of muted anger, sadness, and something much deeper.

<b>          5 INT. BUSH'S BARN - DAY 5
</b>
          Bush enters the barn to check on his companion. MULE is older
          than Bush in mule years and just as gray. He wears an old
          mule blanket everywhere to keep out the cold. He fidgets
          nervously from all the excitement. Bush comforts him.

<b>                         BUS H
</b>          Just a boy, that's all.

<b>                         6 SERIES: 6
</b>          7 Bush rips down an old faded sign at the road and posts a 7
          fresh one:'No Damn Trespassing/Beware of Mule'. Bush checks
          the road in both directions. All clear for now.
          8 Bush splits firewood with powerful cleaving strokes. Mule 8
          dozes in the shade. Bush sees a Model-T approach and turn
          into his road, right past his new sign. He glances at his
          shotgun leaning against the shack.
          The Model-T comes to a shaky stop. A MAN climbs out, sees
          Bush swinging the axe and approaches with trepidation.

<b>                         HORTON
</b>          Mornin', sir.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Hard life if you can't read..

<b>                         HORTON
</b>          Pardon? I'm uh, Reverend Gus
          Horton, sir, how you doing?
          Bush stops his swing and turns and stares coldly at Horton.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Don't need saving, preacher.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          3.
</b>
<b>                         HORTON
</b>          Uh, well, Mr. Wiley Starke has
          passed on, sir. His funeral is
          tomorrow and I thought you might
          want to know since..

<b>                         BUSH
</b>
<b>                         (SOFTLY)
</b>          What got him?

<b>                         HORTON
</b>          Just got old, sir.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Yeah, well..
          Bush returns to chopping wood.
          Feeling awkward, Horton hesitates, starts for his car, stops.

<b>                         HORTON
</b>          Mr. Starke told me that you and him
          ran away from home when you were 6
          years old. Is that true?

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          I talked him into it.
          Bush doesn't turn, just keeps chopping.

<b>                         HORTON
</b>          Well.. anyway.. I.. alright..
          Horton shrugs, get in his car, and leaves.
           Bush strikes the log hard and a cleaved piece goes flying.

<b>          9 EXT. CEMETERY - EVENING 9
</b>
          The loneliness of the empty cemetery is broken by Wiley
          Starke's fresh grave. The mounded earth is covered with
          beautiful flowers and wreathes, a loving send off from his
          family and friends. As we pan past the flowers and cards..
          we realize that the cemetery is not quite empty.
          Hunkered down nearby, Bush is as still as a gravestone,
          staring at the last resting place of his old friend.
          As Bush gets up to leave he stops abruptly and stands frozen,
          staring at a pot of YELLOW FLOWERS on a distant grave. Now he
          turns and walks quickly away in the opposite direction.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          4.
</b>
<b>          10 INT. BUSH'S SHACK - NIGHT 10
</b>
          Rain drums hard on the tin roof as Bush, soaked to the bone
          and shaking with chills, rummages through an old hat box by
          lamp light: Letters, news clippings and keepsakes. He finds
          what he's looking for: A PICTURE of a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN.
          She smiles at us from happier days. Realizing that he is
          raging with a serious fever, he tries to stand up only to
          collapse back on the bed.

<b>                         11 OMIT 11/12/13 11
</b>
<b>          14 EXT. BUSH'S SHACK - NIGHT 14
</b>
          Wrapped in his quilt and carrying the oil lamp, Bush moves
          slowly toward the barn. But he is so wracked with fever he
          has to stop. It stuns him that he can't go on. He never
          thought anything could stop him. Stuck in the rain with the
          shaking lamp sizzling, he stares into the forever darkness,
          the muscles in his jaw rippling in the pale light.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Well hell..

<b>          15 INT. BUSH'S BARN - NIGHT 15
</b>
          Somehow he has made it. Sopping wet and shivering, Bush is in
          bad shape and knows it.
          Mule sees Bush and grunts anxiously as he rises.
          Bush blindly pours Mule some feed and the poor old thing
          snatches his first meal in days.
          Bush tries to think through the fever. He stumbles back to
          the door and swings it wide open so Mule can get out if Bush
          doesn't make it. Satisfied, he comes back and drops hard onto
          a pile of hay near Mule.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Always thought you'd go first..
          White as cotton, Bush stares into the lamp that is running
          out of oil, the light fading fast to darkness. Thoughts
          tumble through his mind, troubling him, stirring the dark
          waters of memory.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          5.

<b>          16 EXT. BUSH'S BARN - MORNING 16
</b>
          PAN across the stillness of the foothills to the barn. The
          door is still swung wide open.
          Back from the brink of death, Bush emerges into the blinding
          sunlight. Mule is dozing in his favorite spot. He swings his
          big gray head over at Bush.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Ahh, don't look so disappointed.

<b>                         17 OMITTED 17
</b>
<b>          18 EXT. BUSH'S BARN - MORNING 18 
</b>
          Mule watches Bush heave a creaky old wagon out from behind
          the barn. Mule climbs up on all fours. Bush gets a set of
          reins and walks toward him. Mule starts to take a stroll,
          knowing what the reins mean.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          You better not.
          Mule looks back, sees an apple in Bush's hand, and stops.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          And coffee when we get there.

<b>          19 EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY 19
</b>
          Old wheels creak and moan. Bush and Mule ease up Main street
          with the cart. PEOPLE try to catch a glimpse of the infamous
          recluse.
          Mule comes to a wearied stop, breathing hard. Bush climbs off
          the cart and walks Mule, ignoring the eyes upon him.

<b>          20 INT. CHAPEL - DAY 20

          Reverend Horton, stoking the wood stove, hears FOOTSTEPS.

</b>          Buddy?

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          6.
</b>          But as he turns he sees Bush silently looking around.

<b>                         HORTON
</b>          Oh! Hello..
          Horton comes to Bush but Bush ignores him and keeps
          critically looking around.

<b>                         HORTON
</b>          What can I do for you, sir?
          Suddenly BUDDY and KATHRYN ROBINSON (20's) enter from the
          vestibule with their new BABY. In their own world, and not
          realizing that there is anyone in the chapel, Kathryn picks
          some lint from Buddy's jacket. He catches her fingers and
          kisses them.
          Bush is transfixed by the loving moment.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          I can wait.
          Buddy and Kathryn see Horton and double-take Bush. Buddy nods
          to Horton and he and Kathryn step back into the vestibule to
          give Bush and Horton privacy.

<b>                         HORTON
</b>          It's alright, have a seat.
          Bush sits down uneasily in a pew. Horton sits down in the pew
          in front of him and twists around to face him. The wintry
          light from the near window washes over them.

<b>                         HORTON
</b>          What's on your mind, sir?

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Bout time for me to get low.

<b>                         HORTON
</b>          Get what?

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Down to business
          Bush reaches into his overalls and puts a balled-up wad of
          MONEY on the pew. Horton's eyes bulge.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Need a funeral.
          Horton looks up from the money.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          7.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Me.
          Buddy peers around from the vestibule, listening, curious as
          hell, until Kathryn pulls him back.

<b>                          HORTON
</b>           For you?
          (off Bush's impatient nod)
          You want to buy a funeral for you?

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Am I not talking right?

<b>                         HORTON
</b>          No, yes, I'm sorry. Are you sick
          sir?

<b>                         BUSH

<b>                         HORTON
</b>          True, but..

<b>                         BUSH

          won't get done, will it?

<b>                         HORTON
</b>          All right, I see. Well the church
          can help you get your affairs in
          order, arrange a service..
          Horton glances at the strange wad of money again.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          What would you say?

<b>                         HORTON
</b>          About what?

<b>                         BUS H
</b>          Me.

<b>                         HORTON
</b>          A eulogy? I.. don't know. What do
          you want me to say?

          face.

<b>                         HORTON
</b>          Well. I uh, I don't know much about
          you, Mr. Bush. I mean, I've heard
          stories but..

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          What stories?
          Bush leans in and stares into Horton. It feels like
          everything in the world stops dead.
          Buddy peeks in again, this time Kathryn peeks too.

<b>                         HORTON
</b>          Just stories..
          (off Bush's intense look)
          .you know, people talking.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          What kind of stories? Say one.

<b>                         HORTON
</b>          Sir.. my mother used to say that
          gossip is the devil's radio..

<b>                         (UNFORTUNATE ASIDE)
</b>          .not that she didn't play that

          (back to business)
          .what matters when you come to the
          end of your life is that you're
          ready for the next one. Have you
          made peace with God, sir?

<b>                         BUS H
</b>          I paid.
          Horton has no idea what Bush means. He looks at the money,
          back at Bush.

<b>                         HORTON
</b>          Well.. you can't buy forgiveness,
          Mr. Bush. It's free. But you do
          have to ask for it.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Nothing in this world is free,

<b>          9.
</b>          Bush abruptly grabs his money and starts out. His hand bangs
          into the pew and the money FALLS.
          Buddy stares wild-eyed at the big wad of money then drops
          back into the vestibule.
          Bush storms past Buddy, Kathryn and the baby like a hot wind.

<b>          20A EXT. CHURCH - DAY 20A
</b>
          Bush heads off down the road on his wagon. Horton, Buddy, and
          Kathryn appear at the door and watch him go.

<b>                         HORTON
</b>          That was, uh, different.

<b>                         KATHRYN
</b>          I heard such awful things about him
          when I was a kid.

<b>                         HORTON
</b>          My mother probably told you some of
          them.
          Kathryn goes back into the church with Horton who is cooing
          at the baby. Buddy lingers, staring at Bush, thinking..

<b>          21 EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY 21
</b>
          Bush's wagon loaded with bags of feed and supplies, sits in
          front of the Diner.
          Bush is holding a big tin cup of coffee for Mule who is
          drinking it and loving it.
          Tom (the kid who threw the rock) comes from behind the diner
          with a full garbage can to empty into the big trash barrels
          on the back of an old pick-up truck. He sees Bush and
          freezes.
          Bush looks up and stares at him.
          The diner door snaps open and BONNIE (30's), Tom's mother,
          steps out. She sees Tom and Bush staring at each other.

<b>                         BONNIE
</b>          What are you doing, son?
          Now Tom is scared to death that Bush is going to tell on him.
          Bonnie doesn't like this staring match at all.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          10.

<b>                         BONNIE
</b>          Empty those cans in your daddy's
          truck and get back in here. Now.
          Finally Bush drops his gaze and lets Tom off the hook.
          Relieved, Tom heaves the can up into the truck. Bonnie
          hesitates then goes back into the diner just as...
          .CARL (30s), his sidekick, GARY, and two other MEN come
          across the street toward the diner. Gary sees Mule slurping
          coffee from the big tin cup.

<b>                         GARY
</b>          Look at that. A mule drinking
          coffee!

<b>                         CARL
</b>          Finally found somebody that likes
          Bonnie's coffee.
          As they move past, they see Bush standing there..

<b>                         WORKER
</b>          Ya'll better hush, that's old Bush.
          Carl eyes him. Gary and the others throw curious glances as
          they head into the diner. Carl stops.

<b>                         CARL
</b>          Hey..

<b>                         (NO RESPONSE)
</b>          I'm talking to you..
          Carl picks up a handful of gravel, tosses some over
          nonchalantly in Bush's direction. Bush ignores it.

<b>                         CARL
</b>          We know about you. You stay out of
          this diner. There's women and
          children here and we don't want you
          around them.
          Bush stands to mount up, never turning around.

<b>                         CARL
</b>          You better hear me. I see you here
          again, I'll.. Hey! Hey!
          Hearing the hollering, Tom looks up from the pick-up.
          Carl throws a stone, harder this time to get Bush's
          attention.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          11.
</b>          But the rock misses Bush and hits Mule, startling him. Old
          instincts kick in and he has a VIOLENT FIT.

<b>                         CARL
</b>          Shit..
          Carl moves up to try and calm him..
          .as Bush tries to ease Mule down the cart hitch grinds a
          GASH in Mule's hind-quarter. Mule whinnies painfully, slowly
          surrendering.
          As Carl steps up, Bush yanks the BRAKE HANDLE off the cart
          and hits Carl in the chest. Air explodes from Carl as he
          gasps with pain. Before he can move, Bush hits him again in
          the same place. Carl wants to hit back but he has no air.
          Lightning quick, Bush steps back and hits Carl again in the
          exact same place.
          Carl falls like a bag of bones. He looks up and sees Bush
          towering over him with a terrible bottled up darkness in him.
          It has all happened so fast it feels like an awful dream to
          Carl.

<b>                         TOM
</b>          Daddy!
          Wild with fear, Bonnie and Tom run toward Bush.

<b>                         BONNIE
</b>          Stop it!! Get away!
          Gary, the Worker burst from the diner but see the brake
          handle in Bush's hand and slow down.
          Bush comes to himself, sees everyone staring, sees Carl in
          tears, and now Tom and Bonnie, trying to get him away..
          Gary and the others slowly move toward Bush. More patrons
          step out from the diner.
          Buddy races up, sees Mule bleeding, and eyes Bush as he grabs
          the reins and leads Mule down Main street, still holding the
          brake handle.

<b>                         CARL
</b>
<b>                         (GASPING)
</b>          I'll kill him!
          Bonnie shushes him softly as Carl moans in pain.
          Tom stares after Bush, mirroring his father's hatred.

          An EMPTY CASKET, awaits its passenger in a small but
          serviceable funeral hall. Through the office door, FRANK
          QUINN sits at his desk, his head completely buried behind a
          paper that he shakes hard every few seconds. His feet are up
          on the desk revealing a pair of lovely burgundy silk socks.

           Frank's hand slips the flask next to his coffee cup into a
           drawer when he HEARS the front door open. But his face
           remains hidden as Buddy enters. Buddy is troubled by the
          fight.

<b>                         BUDDY

          Frank lowers the paper so just his eyes appear. He has no
          southern accent and doesn't look small town.

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          As of right now, you're on

          Remember; foot in the door,
          establish trust, and drop the
          hammer.
          Buddy hesitates, crawls out, and eyes the shack.

<b>                         BUDDY
</b>          I'd feel better if you'd go too.

</b>          No doubt but if you don't do this

          you're any good. And you'll never
          be any good if you don't know you

<b>          32 EXT. BUSH'S SHACK - DAY 32
</b>
          As Buddy uneasily approaches the shack, he feels the
          beautiful stillness and mystery of the place. He KNOCKS
          timidly on the door, pressing an ear to listen.

<b>                         BUDDY
</b>          Hello?
          Nothing. He shoots a look back to the hearse - miles away,
          and knocks a little louder. Nothing. He inches to the window
          and peeks in one of the remaining glass panes then starts to
          slide away..

<b>          CLICK.
</b>          Buddy spins and discovers Bush standing on the ground behind
          him, his shotgun barrel pointed between Buddy's eyes.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Want to see in my house, do you?
          BOOM! Bush blows away several windowpanes and re-aims at
          Buddy's head.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          How's it look?
          Buddy closes his eyes, his last words are for his wife..

<b>                         BUDDY
</b>          Oh, Katie..
          It makes Bush peek out from behind the barrel.

<b>                         BUS H
</b>          You was at the church with your
          wife and baby.
          Buddy opens his eyes and can't believe he is still alive.

<b>                         BUDDY
</b>          Yes, sir.

</b>          I can't remember.

<b>                         BUSH

          They stand there while Buddy thinks..

<b>                         BUDDY
</b>          Oh yeah, I heard.. you wanted a
          funeral.

</b>          Funeral?

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Yes sir. I work at uh.. I work at..
          (tries to think of it)
          .Quinn Funeral Home. I thought I
          could help you.
          Bush glances at his blown out window: 'Damn'. He lowers his
          gun, walks up onto the porch.

<b>                         BUS H
</b>          You like rabbit?

<b>                         BUDDY
</b>          What?
          Bush goes inside.
          Buddy looks desperately back at the hearse but can't see
          Frank. He doesn't know whether to run for it or not.

<b>          33 INT. BUSH'S SHACK - DAY 33
</b>
          The shack is spare as a monk's chamber but has wonderful HAND
          MADE FURNITURE in it.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Sit down.
          There is only chair at the table so Buddy dumps the glass off
          a small stool under the window and sits down low. The wonder
          of not being dead makes him look at everything with new eyes.
          On a window sill he sees a beautiful little CARVED MULE
          emerging from a block of wood.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          17.
</b>          Bush is at the stove tending to a iron skillet of rabbit
          pieces covered with bacon and white gravy.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          It's how you put things together,
          see? Some things go, some things
          never will. Indians said that
          everything spoke to them. That's
          how they made medicine and knew
          what to eat. Things talked to them
          clear as we talk. You believe that?

<b>                         BUDDY
</b>          I.. I don't know, sir.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          If you don't listen you won't hear
          nothing.
          Bush puts the big skillet on the table and sits down.
          Buddy is so low he can look under the table and sees how the
          table legs run right into the top without screws or nails.

<b>                         BUDDY
</b>          Did you make this furniture, sir?
          Never seen any like it. Can't even
          tell what's holding it up.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Magic.
          Buddy looks up. Bush is dead serious. The word lingers.
          Finally..

<b>                         BUDDY
</b>          Alright. Well. Sir, if you do want
          to plan for a funeral service,
          which I hope will be a long long
          time away, we'd treat you with
          respect and offer a good..

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          What'd everybody say about what
          happened in town?

<b>                         BUDDY
</b>          I don't..

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          That crazy old son of a bitch tried
          to beat a man to death for no
          reason? That it?

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          18.
</b>          Buddy is caught off guard by Bush's lucid candor and finds
          himself automatically responding differently to him.

<b>                         BUDDY
</b>          There's two sides to every story.
          As Bush puts some rabbit on Buddy's old yellowed plate..

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          People say that. But they don't
          mean it. They think what they think
          and they don't want to know
          anything else.

<b>                         BUDDY
</b>          Yes, sir, but I think people are so
          scared of what they don't know that
          they make things up to feel better
          about it.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Like life after dying. Heaven.

<b>                         BUDDY
</b>
<b>                         (THINKS)
</b>          I hope that part's true, don't you?

<b>                         (BEAT)
</b>          But I don't think we know the
          actual truth about much of
          anything. I know I don't. I'm just
          guessing most of the time.
          Bush gives Buddy a closer look and motions for him to try the
          rabbit. Fearing the worst, Buddy bends into the steam, takes
          a cautious bites and mutters with shocked surprise..

<b>                         BUDDY
</b>          Lord, that's good..

</b>          I never..

</b>          Yes, sir, I guess, but..

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Tell one.

<b>                         BUDDY
</b>          I'd rather not.
          Bush eases forward, his eyes slit. The old Bush is back.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          I rather you did.

<b>                         BUDDY
</b>          (startled/leans back)
          Well. When I was kid I heard you
          killed some men in a fist fight.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Is that all?
          Bush leans back stone-faced.
          In the silence, Buddy looks over again at the wondrous
          carving of the mule on the window sill, at the big ears and
          long face that are being born from the rough block. It makes
          him smile. But when he glances back, Bush is staring a hole
          through him.

<b>                         BUS H
</b>          What's your name again?

<b>                         BUDDY
</b>          Buddy Robinson, sir.

<b>                         BUS H
</b>          Well, if I need you -- I know where
          you are.
          It sounds almost like a threat. It shorts Buddy out. He stops
          eating and realizes that Bush has taken another turn and that
          he's been dismissed.

<b>          34 EXT. BUSH'S SHACK - DAY 34

          Buddy heads to the hearse, glancing back over his shoulder.
          As he recalls his encounter, he stops, looking back at the
          shack. The old legend has gotten deep under his skin.

          The morning sun breaks over the mountains.

<b>          36 EXT. BUSH'S SHACK - MORNING 36
</b>
          Bush is on the porch, straining boiled herbs, grass, and bark
          into a jar. There is something not right with him and he
          knows it. While the medicine cools he looks out across the
          mountain and draws a deep breath.

<b>          37 EXT. FUNERAL HOME - MORNING 37
</b>
           A well crafted live-in home doubling as a funeral parlor. A
          sign, 'QUINN FUNERAL HOME', hangs from the porch.

<b>          FRANK (O.S.)
</b>          Oh yes Ma'am, I do respect your

<b>          38 INT. FUNERAL HOME/FRANK'S OFFICE - SAME 38

          Frank is looking a little hung over. Buddy walks in. Frank
          points at the phone and rolls his blood shot eyes.

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          .state law requires.. No ma'am, we
          can't bury him under the house..
          There is a loud KNOCK at the door. Buddy goes to get it.

<b>          39 EXT. FUNERAL HOME/FRONT DOOR - DAY 39

          Buddy swings the door open. Bush is standing there. Buddy
          leans back unconsciously, not knowing what to expect.

<b>          FRANK (O.S.)
</b>          Well just for argument's sake,

</b>          But you have to have a container of
          some kind, Ma'am for decency and

          Bush enters the Funeral Home. As Buddy starts to close the
          door, Bush catches it.

<b>                         BUSH

          Frank is still on the phone and pouring himself a drink from
          the flask into his coffee cup in the drawer.

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          Yes, Ma'am, but there's lots of
          natural things that aren't decent.

          He did what?! Good God. No, Ma'am,
          I didn't know that about your
          husband. Well, yeah now I
          understand why you want him under

<b>                         BUDDY
</b>          Frank Quinn, Mr. Bush.
          Frank takes a quick swallow from his cup to fortify himself,
          then jumps up, smiling, and goes to Bush with his hand out.

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          Come in, come in, pleasure. Coffee?
          As Bush shakes Frank's hand, he stares into him, taking
          everything in, his bloodshot eyes, the wrinkled shirt beneath
          his suit, his breath. Frank feels downright naked.

<b>                         BUSH

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          A little bit of everywhere, I

          Buddy stands behind the waiting chair.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          22.

          desk. Buddy pulls up a chair.
          Bush reaches into his coat and pulls out the wad of hermit
          money and lays it on the desk. Frank does something
          phenomenal. He ignores the money.

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          How can we help you, sir?
          Bush gives Buddy a look, then looks back at Frank who
          steadfastly refuses to look at the ball of money.

<b>                         BUSH

          Frank and Buddy stand with Bush in a room dedicated to sales.
          Three caskets are lined up for display. All tanks.
          Bush steps up to a cheap cloth covered box, bangs it with his
          knuckles, and scowls. Frank points to a wooden casket.

<b>                         FRANK

          Bush eyes it, repulsed.

          years of honed instincts surge back to life.

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          We can do that.

          As they come back into the office..

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          And I want to be there.
          Frank goes behind his desk. Buddy and Bush start to sit..

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          You will be, I guarantee it.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          I want to be there now.

<b>                         BUDDY
</b>          You want to be at your funeral..
          party.. alive?
          (off Bush's nod)
          But.. it's not a funeral if you're
          not, you know, deceased..

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          Hold on now, it's a detail, we can
          look at it.

<b>                         BUDDY
</b>          Pretty big detail.

</b>          Frank cuts Buddy a look then smiles at Bush.

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          So you'd like to have a funeral
          party while you're alive so you can
          go?

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Yes or no?

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          Yes.
          Buddy is lost.

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          Buddy, get some paper. We need to
          make of list of who Mr. Bush wants
          to invite..
          As Buddy starts to get up.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Sit down.
          Buddy sits right down.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          I want everybody to come who's got
          a story to tell about me.

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          Say again.

<b>                         BUDDY
</b>           That probably covers 4 counties..
           Bush shoots him a look. Frank shoots him a look. Buddy thinks
           about how great an outdoor life would be.

<b>                          BUSH
</b>          Then I want 4 counties worth of
           people at the party.

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          Well, sir, the thing is, how would
          you get people to come and tell
          stories about you that I'm guessing
          might get them, you know.. shot?
          Bush scoops up the ball of money and heads out. Now all Frank
          can see is the money, leaving.

</b>          You know what, you go ahead, don't
          worry about it, we'll think of
          something. A couple of ideas just
          came to me.

<b>                         BUDDY
</b>          Like what?

<b>          43 EXT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY 43
</b>
          As Bush starts out the open door, he nearly bumps into
          Buddy's wife, Kathryn, and MATTIE DARROW. Mattie is carrying
          Kathryn and Buddy's baby boy.
          Frank sees Mattie and flicks his hair back nervously and
          quickly brushes his teeth with his finger as..
          .Bush gives Mattie a glance and tries to be invisible.

<b>                         MATTIE
</b>          Felix?!
          Feigning deafness, Bush walks on. Sensing something, Kathryn
          takes the baby so Mattie can go after him.

<b>                         MATTIE
</b>          Felix! Say hello to me!
          Frank, eyes wide with surprise, mouths, "Felix?".
          Bush's shoulder hunch then fall as he turns. He looks into
          her, taking everything in. When he speaks his eyes and voice
          are soft.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Hey Mattie.
          Buddy comes out, surprised to see Mattie and Bush together.
          Frank walks up behind him and scowls. Kathryn steers them
          back inside to give Mattie privacy.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Heard you moved off.

<b>                         MATTIE
</b>          I've been back a while.

          Buddy and Frank are peeking out the window. They see Mattie
          standing alone as Bush walks away.

<b>                         FRANK

</b>          So? We got to know.
          Kathryn shakes her head and goes back outside. FRANK has
          another look at Mattie then lets the curtain fall back.

<b>                         FRANK

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          We have a plan. All we need is a
          little bit of your time.

<b>                         BUDDY
</b>          Seeing it is better than hearing
          about it.
          Bush looks at the hearse, back at Buddy and Frank.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          How much is it gonna cost?

          (touches his own chest)
          I didn't say anything about money.

<b>                         (TO BUSH)
</b>          If we can't get you what you want
          you don't owe us anything.

<b>          47 INT. HEARSE - DAY 47
</b>
          Frank, Buddy, and Bush ride in the front seat of the hearse.
          They are together but in very different worlds. They don't
          even look at each other when they talk.
          Buddy is lost in serious thought.
          Frank is preoccupied about the deal and driving too fast.
          Bush is scrunched up to the door. He is going much faster
          than he is used to going. He kinda likes it and kinda
          doesn't.

<b>                         BUSH

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          Didn't buy it for them.

<b>                         BUDDY
</b>          (out of nowhere)
          We say that funerals are "For the
          Living" but we forget what that
          means sometimes, I guess.
          (to Bush but almost to

<b>                         HIMSELF)
</b>          I was thinking about your funeral
          party before I went to sleep last
          night and I think I understand it a
          little now. When I was a kid, my
          folks where killed in a bad car
          wreck and the people at the funeral
          home... they did the impossible as
          far as I was concerned. I don't
          know what I would've done without
          them. And I remember wishing that
          my mother and daddy were there to
          see how beautiful they made
          everything.
          Frank is hearing this for the first time and is shocked. Bush
          glances softly at Buddy then looks out the side window at the
          world rushing by too fast. All at once he gives in to it.

<b>          48 EXT. TOWN STREET - DAY 48

          The hearse pulls up on main street. Frank, Buddy, and Bush
          get out and head toward Feldman's Clothing Store.

          Frank and Buddy enter the store and find MR. FELDMAN and a

          turn to show Bush what is happening they see him go by the
          window outside.

          Tollerude, pumps Bush's chair upward.

<b>                         (TO BUSH)

          Bush gives him the hairy eyeball then speaks to Mr.
          Tollerude, a clear threat.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Don't leave me naked.

</b>          Mr. Bush, you can get all the hairs

          Bush is seated in front of a backdrop painted with a bridge,
          a swan, and a pond. The Photographer is trying to tidy up
          Bush without offending him. As he walks back to camera, Bush
          roughs himself up and looks truly wild.
          Buddy snickers. When the Photographer gets back to the
          camera, he cocks his head, what?!

          Mr. Tollerude, nervous as hell, brings Bush up from his
          reclining position and turns the chair to the mirror.
          Bush studies his well trimmed hair and beard for a moment.
          It's impossible to tell what his thoughts are as he looks
          into his own eyes.
          Buddy and Frank are in the mirror too, staring at him.

</b>
          Bush stands in front of a full length mirror. He has on a
          decent black suit, pinned to be hemmed, and a plain white
          shirt, open at the collar. It is a startling change. But we
          still can't tell what he is thinking.
          Buddy is staring at him with honest disbelief.
          Frank is quietly trying to get Mr. Feldman to lower the price
          for the suit. He looks over and double-takes Bush.

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          Son of a bitch, it's almost worth
          it.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>
<b>                         (TO BUDDY)
</b>          What do you think?

<b>                         BUDDY
</b>          I wouldn't know you, sir.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Maybe the Devil won't either. Might
          work out.

<b>                         (TO FRANK)
</b>          Where's the shoes?

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          Well, normally people don't wear
          shoes in a casket so..
          (off Bush's scowl)
          .what are you, about a 10D?

<b>          54 INT. FELDMAN'S CLOTHING STORE - MOMENTS LATER 54
</b>
          Buddy stands beside Frank who is still trying to get a deal
          on the clothes. Bush walks up with two pairs of pants and two
          new shirts, puts them on the counter, gives Frank a hard
          look, and walks away. Frank looks down at the clothes, over
          at Buddy.

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          Pretty optimistic taking a change
          of clothes to the grave.
          (calls over his shoulder)
          How you set for underwear?

<b>          BUSH (O.S.)
</b>          Don't wear none.

<b>          56 INT. HEARSE - DAY 56
</b>
          Everyone is back in the hearse. Something is eating at Frank.

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          I don't mean to be nosey but uh..
          how do you know Mattie?

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          She's a peach.
          Frank and Buddy cut Bush a look. He looks ahead.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          We had a go.
          Frank nearly drives off the road.

<b>          57 INT. FUNERAL HOME/ FRANK'S ROOM - NIGHT 57
</b>
          Late night Poker. Cigarette smoke drifts into the air.
          Frank, Carl, Rev. Horton, Mattie, and RAY, a banker, are at
          the table. Ray has the untouchable presence of someone
          privileged which appears to be driving Frank up a tree
          tonight. Horton gathers up his winnings.

<b>                         HORTON
</b>          "The Lord loves a cheerful giver.."

<b>                         MATTIE
</b>          Oh please.. you think the Lord's
          taking sides in a poker game in a
          funeral home?
          Horton shrugs and points to the divine evidence.

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          If He is, the Divine's cheating.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          Exactly.

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          Don't agree with me Ray, it makes
          me doubt myself.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          34.
</b>          Ray sighs and studies his perfectly cut nails.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          I would have turned down your loan
          if you were my own dear mother,
          Frank.

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          You made my point and don't even
          know it.

<b>                         MATTIE
</b>          Jesus, would you two stop it!
          You're worse than two old women..
           Ray shrugs, sweetly blase. Frank tries to rein in his temper
           for her. The loss of the hand is especially hard on Carl who
          has only a couple of dollars left.

<b>                         CARL
</b>
<b>                         (TO FRANK)
</b>          What were you doing with that old
          bastard in town today, anyway?

<b>                         RAY
</b>          Oh yes. Buying him clothes, getting
          him a haircut..on credit.
          Frank shoots him a look.

<b>                         HORTON
</b>          Took out ads in a bunch of papers
          too, something about a party?

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          God, I love small towns.

<b>                         MATTIE
</b>          Who are you talking about?

<b>                         RAY
</b>          That hermit, what's his name..

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          (a knowing look at Mattie)
          "Felix" Bush.

<b>                         MATTIE
</b>          You're giving him a party?

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          A funeral party.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          35.
</b>
<b>                         MATTIE
</b>          Whatever you're drinking is not
          being good to you at all.

<b>                         CARL
</b>          What the hell is a funeral party?

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          Hey, the man wants to be at his own
          funeral. What can I say? I'd like
          to be at my funeral so I could tell
          my ex-wife to kiss my..

<b>                         MATTIE
</b>          What makes you think she'd show up
          for you?

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          Because, Dear, vultures are
          constitutionally unable to ignore
          the dead.
          Mattie grins which delights Frank, no end.
          Horton stops counting his money and stares at Frank.

<b>                         HORTON
</b>          It's that big wad of money of his
          you're after.
          There is a crack in Ray's disinterest that he tries to hide.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          What money is that?

<b>                         MATTIE
</b>          Felix has money?
          Everyone is looking at Frank but he shuffles the cards.

<b>                         HORTON
</b>          He came to see me, wanting a
          funeral, had a big old greasy ball
          of money. Talked like he thought he
          could buy his way to heaven with
          it.

<b>                         RAY
</b>
<b>                         (SERIOUSLY)
</b>          How much has he got? Maybe he can.
          Hearing that Bush wants or needs a real funeral Mattie is
          suddenly truly concerned.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          36.
</b>
<b>                         MATTIE
</b>          Is he sick, Gus?
          Horton shrugs. Frank notes the concern and doesn't like it.
          Carl coughs and his ribs make him break out into a sweat.

<b>                         CARL
</b>          I'll tell you one damn thing, ain't
          nobody gonna go to a funeral for
          that son of a bitch.
          Mattie gives Carl a look

<b>                         HORTON
</b>          Language..

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          They might. He's inviting everyone
          who has a story about him to come.
          You could tell about him kicking
          your ass, Carl.
          Carl looks at Frank as if he wants to cold cock him.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          Old man is going to ride the Weird
          Train right into the ground, isn't
          he?

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          Wouldn't you like to know what
          everybody says about you behind
          your back, Ray?
          (off his look)
          Yeah, probably not.

<b>                         HORTON
</b>          I already know way more about
          people than I need to.

<b>                         MATTIE
</b>          Or want to.

<b>                         HORTON
</b>          Amen.

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          Let's play some cards.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          37.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          Oh for God's sake, face it Frank,
          you're broke.
          This is not about cards. It's a declaration meant to
          embarrass Frank in front of everyone. Frank feels their eyes
          on him as he starts to pull off his watch. Ray waves it off.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          Please. I've won that 4 times
          already.

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          It's who has it last that counts.

<b>                         CARL
</b>          Say what you want but if there
          hadn't been anybody there the other
          day he would've killed me. And I
          guarantee you it wouldn't have been
          his first time.
          It sounds true and everyone is quiet except Mattie.

<b>                         MATTIE
</b>          Everybody knows you started it.
          (off his glare)
          Don't look at me like that. I
          remember when you were born. You
          were the sweetest little boy. What
          is wrong with you?
          Momentarily shamed, Carl's face softens and we can see a
          better man there. He struggles to hold on to it but..

<b>                         CARL
</b>          I made a mistake. But there's a
          line.. and he crossed it.. and
          everybody knows that too. Ya'll go
          on and have a party with the devil
          for his money but I'll dance on his
          grave someday.
          Carl snatches his few dollars up and heads out.

<b>                         HORTON
</b>          You kind of hate to admit it when
          it comes to Carl but he's got a
          point. You don't know what Bush is
          doing. What if he just wants to get
          everybody in one place so he can
          turn his shotgun on them?

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          38.

<b>                         MATTIE
</b>          He wouldn't..

<b>                         HORTON
</b>          I looked in his eyes. The truth is
          nobody knows what he's capable of.
          Maybe even he doesn't know.
          She looks into him. Frank starts to deal the cards.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          Go ahead and lay your watch down,
          Frank. But I am going to keep it
          this time, alright, on principle.

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          I got an idea. Let's try something
          different.

<b>                         (TO RAY)
</b>          The cards in your sock? Leave'em
          there.
          Everyone freezes. Ray shakes his head.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          What are you trying to pull now?

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          You really think you're that good
          that nobody sees?

<b>                         RAY
</b>          Sees what?

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          You cheat at everything you do.
          Even at the bank, you loan people
          just enough to get'em deeper in so
          you can foreclose on them.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          You are a pathetic man. And a
          goddamn..

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          Am I? Then stand up and roll down
          your socks.
          (a deep dark look)
          Stand up or I'll stand you up.
           Ray looks around the table and suddenly realizes that he is
           irreversibly exposed and alone. The sound of Frank's chair
          scraping the floor makes him jerk up.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>                         39
</b>          He walks out, trying to find his old confident rhythm and
          failing. Everyone sits in uneasy silence.

<b>          58 INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 58

           Horton waves and walks out, leaving the door open. Frank
           walks Mattie to the door, helping with her coat, trying to
          work up his nerve to say..

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          I'll walk you home.

<b>                         MATTIE

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          You came because you don't know
          what to do with yourself.
          (off her look)
          I slept on the same side of the bed
          my whole life, right? But after my
          wife left me, I switched sides,
          just like that, and never been able
          to go back.

<b>                         MATTIE

          can pour everything, even a

          where they were but it's still
          always empty.

          He stares after her, wishing that she could see him the way
          he sees her.

          Dim lamp light glows. We see Bush sitting on the edge of the
          bed wiping the sweat from his face with a sheet. He looks up
          at the picture of the beautiful woman.

          A tiny PLACE, cramped with radio gear.
          Buddy and Frank peer through a glass window into a small
          control booth.(We will cut back and forth between the glass)
          Buddy is having misgivings about being here. But Frank gives
          the thumbs up to the young WCGM ANNOUNCER in the booth, a
          hopeful kid with a smooth voice and dreams of the big-time.
          The Announcer hands Bush a set of headphones. Bush is wearing
          his new clothes and truly looks like a different man.
          Bush is puzzled by the headset. The kid takes it and clamps
          it onto Bush's head. He starts to yank them off then hears a
          song playing inside his head and loves it. But now the
          announcer cuts the record off and Bush scowls.

<b>                         ANNOUNCER

          today on WCGM. Our special guest is
          going to tell us about an event

          here he is, Mr. Felix Bush, the

          Bush is surprised by the sound of his own voice.

</b>          So tell us, sir, exactly how did
          you come up with the idea of having
          a funeral party before you die?

<b>                         BUSH

          about our interview. I've heard
          some pretty wild stories..

          has a story about you to come and
          tell it. Is that right?

          yelps! Buddy looks oddly perplexed and sad.

          pleased by his new do.

          The first stop on the tour is a small fenced grave site near
          the shack. Three grave markers with names carved into them:

<b>          KEEPER, CHARLIE, MAUDE.
</b>          Bush is squatting down staring at the markers. Mattie stands
          close beside him. Since his attention is elsewhere she looks
          at him in an unguarded way. Her mind is full of questions,
          old and new.

<b>                         BUSH

          Mattie and Bush walks side by side through the last of the
          glimmering light and shadows beneath the trees. It is a
          chilly and Mattie's cheeks are flushed. She is enchanted by
          the place. Bush tries to hide how winded he is..

          I tried to write you at times but I
          didn't know what to say.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Well. I heard you married.

</b>          He was a Doctor; a real good man.
          We lived in St. Louis for awhile.
          He died unexpectedly about a year
          ago. I came back here because.. I
          have no idea why.

          sometimes I feel like all I'm doing
          is waiting for my name to come up.

          She gives him a curious look.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          You can't wait for anything,
          Mattie. Close your eyes, hold your
          breath.. stay in one spot your
          whole life, but you're still
          moving, like the world's moving
          under you. There's no waiting.

<b>                         MATTIE

          But suddenly she is lifted from the chair as if by strong
           ropes. She stares at the wall as she walks toward Bush's bed.
          Bush is stricken and white. He would stop her if he could but
          it is too late.
          She walks right up to the picture at the edge of the lamp
          light and stares into it as if it is a mirage that will
          disappear if she blinks.
          Finally she whirls and looks at him, her face a tortured
          mask. A strangled sob escapes her.
          He gets up and stands there staring at the floor.
          Suddenly she is moving toward him and then past him and out
          the door. Her shadow merges with the darkness. Bush stands
          with his head down, staring into oblivion.

          Buddy comes in frowning and lugging a heavy mail sack. What
          the hell? He looks up and sees more sacks dumped on the desk.
          Frank is grinning and ripping open envelopes from the sacks
          and each one has 5 dollars in it! Buddy looks down and sees
          even more mail sacks on the floor!

          stacked across the desk and the full paper sacks all around

          you could get maybe 10 times that
          or more. I don't know what to do
          with it. I mean it's yours to do
          with what you want but I'm getting
          a little nervous about it. Never
          thought I'd see enough money to
          make me nervous. We should probably
          talk about the price for
          everything, the clothes, the ads,
          the food and drink for the party,
          the music.. our fee for everything,
          we'll be fair about that, I'm not
          worried about it.
          Bush is looking at Buddy who is looking across the room.

</b>          Money makes people do funny things.
          Frank scowls.

</b>          I think you should probably put it
          in the bank, sir.

</b>          No! Ray is not..

          pay them. Put this money in a box
          and the boy and I'll take it

          new comes in, keep it in the bottom
          of one of them ugly caskets in

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          He wants you to go with him to take

          closing a deal, Buddy, and the

          window. Frank scowls and lowers the blinds.

          Frank is at Mattie's door entranced by the troubled but
          beautiful piano music coming from inside. It stops abruptly
          when he knocks. In seconds, Mattie appears.

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          Hey Mattie.
          He looks almost boyish and bashful as he drinks her in.

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          Was that you? It was really..

<b>                         MATTIE
</b>          This is a surprise.

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          Yeah, sorry.
          He stands, loving the view, forgetting why he is here.
          She waits it out as long as she can, not sure how she feels
          about this adoring look.

<b>                         MATTIE
</b>          Was there something you..?

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          I'm up to my ears with this funeral

          had time to talk much lately so
          maybe you'd like to come over and
          rip open envelopes with me and

          93 He stops and looks around, awed by the beautifully serene 93
          sanctuary.
          Now he sees a tall BLACK MAN (70) come out of an office door
          behind the pulpit, walk up the aisle, glancing out the window
          at the driveway, and then at Buddy.

          Buddy is out of words that he is allowed to say. He glances
          at the door but Bush is not coming in.

</b>          Are you sure you're in the right
          place? Not expecting a funeral.
          Suddenly Bush steps into the church. Charlie squints over
          then stares at Bush with utter disbelief.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Hey, Charlie.
          They shake hands, then hug. Buddy is blown away that Bush
          would hug anyone. Bush looks up at the church rafters.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Still standing.

<b>                         CHARLIE

          Charlie give Bush a look then holds out his hand to Buddy
          again.

</b>          My hearing is not what it was. It

          to preach at your funeral party
          with you sitting there?

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Yes, sir.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          (shaking his head)
          You know I've talked to God a lot
          about you over the years and he
          said he broke the mould when he
          made you. Said you were sure
          entertaining to watch but way too
          much trouble.
          Buddy grins.

<b>                         BUSH

          Buddy plops back down.

<b>                         CHARLIE

          alone with me?

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          He can hear what's said.
          Buddy is surprised again. So is Charlie.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          All right. After you left here..
          did you do the right thing?

<b>                         CHARLIE

          Bush looks off and the muscles jump in his jaw.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Did you tell her, Felix?
          Charlie sighs, leans on his knees, and drops his head.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          You came a long way for nothing
          then.
          Bush's eyes jerk back to Charlie and they are hot.
          Buddy tenses.

<b>                         BUSH

          goddamn years! No wife, no kids, no
          friends! That's not enough?

          that then, Charlie? Hell, say it
          all! I don't care.

</b>          Not on your life.
          The air is so heavy you can't breathe it. Bush suddenly gets
          up and leaves. Buddy starts to follow. Charlie puts his hand
          on him to stay. They sit in silence a moment.

          dreams. You can make up a story
          about him chasing rabbits but you
          don't know if there's rabbits in
          there or not. And he can't tell

          glisten in the darkness. An old pocket lighter flares to
          reveal Bush staring at a pot of yellow flowers. He holds the
          lighter to a tombstone and brushes away the debris. It reads:
          MARY LEE STROUP B. 1874 D. 1894. THUNDER rolls.
          Close on Bush's face as rain begins to fall..

          Frank enters with a flashlight. He sees that his desk and
          files have been ransacked. He rushes into the casket room.
          Several caskets have been thrown to the floor. He goes to the
          one where the money is, finds that it is sealed tight, and
          sighs with relief. Hearing something he whips the light
          around and sees Buddy on the floor.

<b>          107 INT. FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT/LATER 107

           Frank examines a cut and bump on top of Buddy's head by
           flashlight and dabs it gently with a cloth.

<b>                          FRANK
</b>           The cut's not bad but how's the 
           head? 
          He moves his finger across Buddy's eyes.

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          Follow it.
          He looks him over carefully. He's had experience.

</b>          Dizzy? Double vision? Nauseous? 
          (off Buddy's no) 
          You'll be okay. Did you see who it 
          was?

<b>                         BUDDY

          Mattie sits beside a fire, knitting a baby blanket by an oil
          lamp. All at once the lights sputter on, the radio lights up,
          warms, and begins to PLAY, as a KNOCK at the door..

          Mattie pulls the door open. Bush is standing there soaking
          wet, breathing hard, holding his shotgun. She draws back
          reflexively. He looks into her.

<b>                         BUSH

          Bush stands with a towel around him, shivering.
          Mattie opens a dresser drawer. Inside the drawer, is the
          carefully arranged tableau of a watch, a ring, a stethoscope,
          and some clothes. She hates to disturb the drawer but pulls
          out a pair of black pants and a white shirt, lays them on the
          bed, and walks out.

<b>          111 INT. DARROW HOME/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 111
</b>
          Mattie steps from the kitchen with a steaming mug as Bush
          comes down the stairs in clothes that are too loose.
          Still shivering, Bush steps uneasily in front of the fire.
          Mattie hands him the hot mug. He looks uneasily at the yellow
          flowers on the table nearby.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Thank you.

</b>          What are you doing here?
          Burned through, a log falls in the fire. Bush jerks oddly and
          moves away.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Can I sit a minute?
          She stares at him then nods at a chair. She keeps standing
          behind the other chair.
          He bends over the mug and seems to lock up inside.

<b>                         BUSH

          me to get to her?
          Bush is so still he looks like a gargoyle.

<b>                         MATTIE
</b>          If you're not going to talk, leave.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Can you help who you love?
          Mattie's face tells us that she has asked herself that
          question many times.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          I've had 40 years to think about it

<b>                         MATTIE
</b>          I don't know either, so..
          Slowly the gargoyle unfolds. His eyes drill into her.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          I want to tell you how it was. If
          you don't want me to, I'll go.
          Mattie sighs from down deep in her shoes then comes around
          and sits down.

<b>                         MATTIE

</b>          She was married! And she wasn't
          just my sister, she was my best
          friend. We told each other
          everything. I can't.. how long did
          it go on?!
          Bush's face is so white it looks like a death mask.

<b>                         MATTIE
</b>          How long?

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          It's still going on, Little Bit.
          Mattie tries to absorb that. The truth and tragedy of it
          touches her in way that she is not prepared for. They sit
          there in silence. She suddenly wipes her face and scowls.

<b>                         MATTIE
</b>          Did you have anything to do with
          her death?
          The mug trembles. She sees it.

<b>                         MATTIE
</b>          Tell me.
          Like a fish jerked from the water, he mouth opens and closes,
          but nothing comes out.

<b>                         MATTIE (CONT'D)

<b>                         MATTIE
</b>          Just tell me, Felix. Did you hurt

          a NOISE. He reaches into the drawer and turns with a pistol
          in his hand.
          Bush is standing in the doorway with his shotgun.

          to a page of a stamp collection book. Fingers fill an empty
          space with a prized addition. A LOUD KNOCKING startles him
          and the stamp is placed slightly crooked..

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          You told Bush that you wouldn't

          He's got a way of making people do

          Frank whistles and takes Bush's poster out of his coat.
          Charlie jerks at the picture of the wild man.

</b>          He came to see me after he'd been

          I think he told you. You may be the

          wants you to tell it for him.

<b>                         CHARLIE

</b>          Yeah but if you're not coming, I'm
          not going back. I made promises I
          can't keep to people I care about.

          If I'm gonna have to start over
          again, might as well be from here.
          Charlie scowls at him.

          Bush is sanding the beautiful lid of his casket. It is
          leaning against the wall and sawdust is drifting down all
          over him. He suddenly stops, rubs the wood tenderly, muscles
          up the heavy top to put it on the box and staggers back. It's
          not the weight, something is wrong. Sweat pops out on his
          forehead. He forces himself to the casket and drops the top
          down hard, staggers back against the loft ladder, slides down
          to the ground, and stares at the casket. Is this it?

          Frank is lying in the back of the hearse, his head propped up
          on an old suitcase. He sips from his flask and stares out the
          window, thinking.

          Bush is still on the ground propped against the ladder. His
          eyes are closed and the fading light steals across his face
          that is as still as it can be. The sawdust makes him look
          almost wooden. A shadow crosses then comes closer.
          Buddy is sure he is dead but Bush's eyes open.

<b>                         BUDDY

          dark in a small southern town, scratching on a screen.

          Frank has cleaned the wound. Buddy has made a poultice that
          Bush is pressing onto the wound as he hears the last of
          Horton's prayer over the loudspeakers.

          like he might take it. Then he shakes his head, puts a rag
          over the poultice and pulls his shirt up.

          Bush scowls at the huge blood stain on his shirt. He looks at
          Frank's white shirt. Frank just stares at him. Bush keeps
          looking. Finally Frank sighs and starts loosening his tie.

          Buddy gently helps Bush into his jacket, which has a bullet
          tear in it along the shoulder but Bush seems okay with it, to
          Frank's relief.
          Frank is putting on an old faded shirt of Bush's. As Bush
          starts for the door, he comes up beside Charlie.

</b>          You're the one they're shooting at.
          As Charlie opens the door, Bush stops, all his misgivings
          flooding in with the light. He looks at Buddy.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Pretty interesting day so far, huh
          boy?
          Bush straightens himself up and goes out the door.

           Charlie, Bush walk through the murmuring parting crowd toward
           the stage. Frank and Buddy are close behind. Buddy is looking
           for Kathryn. She spots him and moves toward the stage.

<b>          162 EXT. BUSH'S LAND/FIELD - DAY 162

          Bush and Charlie go up the steps to the stage.
          At the last second, Bush stares at the big microphone and
          stops, unable to go on.
          Charlie gives him a look then goes on up to the microphone
          and looks out a the sea of white folks.

<b>                         CHARLIE

          words.
          Just below the stage, Buddy and Frank are joined by Kathryn.
          Charlie glances back at Bush, turns inward, searching for the
          words. Finally he holds his hands out, wide apart.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          We like to imagine that good and

          and laces his fingers

<b>                         TIGHTLY)
</b>          .all tangled up with each other.
          Bush raises his head and looks at Charlie's back.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Some 40 years ago Felix Bush
          dropped into my life and then
          dropped out. In between he built
          the most beautiful sanctuary that
          I've ever seen. A lot of wonderful
          things happened in that church.
          Suddenly Bush breaks away, moves up beside Charlie, and puts
          his hand on his shoulder.

</b>
<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Thank you, Charlie. Thank you.
          Charlie gives him a long look then steps away from the
          microphone and moves back to where Bush was standing.
          Bush stares at the microphone, takes a breath, and walks up
          to it, and looks out over the huge crowd.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Had to go clear to Illinois to find
          somebody that had anything good to
          say about me. Hell of a thing.
          His voice booms out over the crowd, startling him. He looks
          down, sees Buddy, Kathryn, Frank and Horton.
          He looks closer for someone most important but she is not
          there. The crowd murmurs. Finally..

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          I'm not a smart man or a wise one.
          I don't know what kind of man I am.
          I was always restless, thought I'd
          see the world. But I didn't hardly
          go nowhere.. on purpose..

<b>                         (BEAT)
</b>          Because.. because I did something

          couldn't ever fix.

<b>                         (GLANCES AROUND)
</b>          Ya'll probably think you know what
          you'd do or what you wouldn't. And
          I wish you good luck with that. I
          really do.

<b>                         (BEAT)
</b>          When I told Charlie what I'd done,
          he told me to confess to God and
          the law and to.. to someone else..
          so I could get forgiveness. But I
          didn't want forgiveness.

<b>                         (BEAT)
</b>          I needed to hold on to what I did..
          to be sick from it every day of my

          He stops, not knowing how to go on. The crowd has quieted
          completely.
          As as his eyes sweep over the sea of expectant faces, he
          suddenly SEES HER coming through the crowd.

</b>          Mattie's here. Seeing that Felix appears to alright, her face
          changes from conflicted concern to open unbridled hatred.
          The look takes Bush's breath away. But he suddenly seems to
          accept it as his due and when he talks, it is only to her.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          I fell in love with a married lady.
          And somehow she fell in love with
          me. It was the only time that I

<b>                         (GATHERS HIMSELF)
</b>          We made a plan to run off and start

          at the time that we said we'd meet.
          I got a funny feeling and I went to
          her house.
          Buddy, Kathryn and Frank all see Mattie now, see Bush talking
          just to her.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Her husband answered the door.

<b>                         (BEAT)
</b>          He had blood on him.
          For Mattie all of this is like window into the past being
          suddenly thrown open and she is haunted and mesmerized.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          I hit him pretty hard, knocked him
          down. Can't remember going upstairs
          but I remember I saw a hammer on
          the steps and it had blood and hair
          on it.
          The crowd gasps. Mattie is trembling.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          I found her in the bedroom. She was
          crawling across the floor.

<b>                         (BEAT)
</b>          But before I could get to her and
          help her up.. a kerosene lamp hit
          the wall. And then her husband
          jumped on my back. Funny what
          happens sometimes when things go
          wrong. It's like the clock stops
          and you have all the time in the
          world to think. I could see that
          her husband had set the downstairs
          on fire before he came up.

          Kathryn comes and hugs Mattie as.. Bush and Buddy come back.
          Bush goes to Charlie.
          Frank is staring at Buddy, looking for a clue as to what Bush
          said. Buddy gives him nothing,

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Thanks again for coming, Charlie.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          I'm proud of you.

<b>                         (MEANING IT)
</b>          Thank you for my church.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Did you ever get my bill?

<b>                         HORTON
</b>          Can we get a ride our car's about 2
          miles down the road.
          Everyone piles into the hearse. There is no back seat so they
          all have to crawl in the back door and sit along the sides.
          It makes everyone smile. Mattie gives Bush one last fleeting
          embrace then climbs in. Bush looks in on them all for a long
          moment all then closes the door.
          As the hearse moves out, he waves to Buddy who is looking out
          the back window. Buddy waves back.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>
<b>                         (TO HIMSELF)
</b>          Look at that. My funeral and
          everybody's in there but me.
          The hearse pulls onto the road and drives away.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          101.
</b>          The place is suddenly quiet and beautiful. He looks down the
          road through the fading dust and sees a WOMAN walking slowly
          toward him. He squints, recognizes her, and his face fills
          with a timeless love.

<b>          168 EXT. BUSH'S LAND - DAY - TWO MONTHS LATER 168
</b>
          It's a cold day beneath the spreading pecan tree. Mule stands
          hitched to the wagon. The three dog grave markers are
          frosted.
          A fourth grave marker just like the others leans against the
          tree. It is freshly carved with: Felix Elijah Bush. A pot of
          fresh yellow flowers sit beside the marker.
          Bush's beautiful handmade casket is inside his grave.
          Frank, Mattie, Charlie, Buddy, Kathryn, and Horton stand
          beside the grave. Several MEN with shovels wait near the
          tree. Charlie's eulogy is more of a one-sided conversation
          which Bush would probably love.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Well, Felix, this one's for real, I
          guess. I didn't actually see them
          put you in the box so..
          Charlie glances over and notices "Charlie" on one of the
          dog's grave markers. He snorts and shakes his head.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Wherever you are, you're probably
          giving someone a hard time or
          something wonderful and priceless
          just to confuse them. Not
          everything can be figured out, nor
          everybody. I wish you peace from
          the burdens of your mind and heart.
          I wish it for us all.
          Mattie moves toward the edge of the grave. Frank puts a hand
          out to catch her should she should stumble. She stares down
          at the FB on the coffin, opens her hand, and lets the picture
          of her sister drift down onto the coffin.

<b>          169 EXT. HILLSIDE - LATER 169
</b>
          Everyone moves away as the men fill in the grave. Buddy and
          Kathryn move up beside Frank and Mattie and Charlie. Buddy
          tosses the ball of hermit money to Frank.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          102.
</b>
<b>                         BUDDY
</b>          A 50 on the outside, all ones
          inside. Less than $100.

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          What?!

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          I told you. Nobody listens to the
          preacher.
          Buddy pulls some papers from his coat.

<b>                         BUDDY
</b>          The day of the party he told me
          about the will he had in the secret
          drawer of his table. He left the
          raffle money to all of us.
          Everyone is shocked, touched.

<b>                         BUDDY
</b>
<b>                         (TO FRANK)
</b>          But you have to pay for Mule's
          upkeep for the rest of his life.
          Charlie grins and Buddy flaps the papers at him.

<b>                         BUDDY
</b>          And he set up a fund for the
          upkeep of your church.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          What's the catch?

<b>                         BUDDY
</b>          No catch, sir.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Still don't get it, do you? With
          Felix, there's always a catch.

<b>                         BUDDY
</b>          Maybe he just knew you'd go crazy
          wondering what it was.
          They all laugh and move down the hillside. As the laughter
          fades we see in their faces the impact that Felix Bush has
          had upon them. Buddy feels the comfort of this odd but
          growing family and stops and looks back at the grave and the
          pot of yellow flowers. His curiosity about the fearsome old
          man has not abated. Nor will it ever.
