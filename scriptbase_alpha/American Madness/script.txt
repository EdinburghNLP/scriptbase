                         a clean-looking, personable youngster. 
                         Several of the tellers are standing

                         pawnbroker with the glass eye?

                         Well, I'll tell you. A fellow went into 
                         this shop to pawn his watch. The pawnbroker 
                         said, "I'll give you $50 for it, if 
                         you can tell me which is my glass eye." 
                         The fellow said, "All right, I'll do 
                         that. It's the right one." The pawnbroker 
                         said, "That's correct. But how did you 
                         know it was the right one?" The fellow

                         than the other one."
                                      
                         He turns, expecting their laugh, but 
                         is confronted by stone faces.

                         the joke.

                         This cracks them all up, as a uniformed 
                         officer, who has been standing by, works 
                         a lever attached to the floor, which 
                         lowers a section of the floor, directly 
                         in front of the vault. This permits 
                         the vault door, which is sunk below 
                         the floor level, to swing open.

                         Matt opens the inside door, made up 
                         of perpendicular steel bars. The tellers 
                         scurry into the cavernous-looking interior.

                         The back walls of the vault are lined 
                         with steel cabinets divided into many 
                         small compartments. On one side is a 
                         wall safe which is also opened by a 
                         combination and which contains the surplus 
                         cash carried by the bank. Matt is in 
                         charge of this. All around the room 
                         are numerous hand trucks - one for every 
                         teller. These trucks contain the cash 
                         in the charge of the individual tellers. 
                         While the tellers in the b.g. obtain 
                         their keys and open the drawers of their 
                         trucks, Matt examines the time clock 
                         which is attached to the inside of the 
                         vault door.

                         The handle of the switch points in the 
                         direction of a sign reading ON. Matt's 
                         hand comes into the scene and throws 
                         the switch up toward a sign reading 
                         OFF. This is done with no comment, it

                         He leans over, and she gives him a quick 
                         kiss.

                         She quickly kisses him again, crosses 
                         back, and takes the grand stairs up 
                         to the outer office of the bank president 
                         as Matt watches with a grin.

                         instinctive conservatism rebels against 
                         Dickson's liberal banking methods.

                         Mr. Clark's right. Dickson will ruin 
                         this bank if we don't stop him.

                         Looks to me as if we're in hot water

                         A very dignified but meek little old 
                         man, Jonathan Ives, tries horning in:

                         Gentlemen, I was just wondering—

                         As another of the directors, O'Brien, 
                         a large, bull-faced, thunderous-voiced 
                         contractor, rises to Dickson's defense. 
                         (O'Brien is always filing his nails, 
                         even while he talks.)

                         Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken 
                         about nothing. Dickson's all right.

                         Oh, is he? We carry more unsecured paper 
                         than any other institution in the city. 
                         We're fools to tolerate it.

                         to end it is to get Dickson out.

                         take control away from him. We'll put

                         Dickson won't stand for it.

                         quite a dash with the women. He looks 
                         off toward the men as Clark's voice 
                         comes in:

                         Cluett exits toward door again. Clark 
                         picks up the list and looks at it. Then 
                         he addresses the other men:

                         dollars to a hotel that's on its last 
                         legs. I tell you, people get loans in

                         HELEN
                                     
                         Yes.

                         A friend of mine - yeah, really - his 
                         mother was terribly sick and she was 
                         dying, would you believe it?

                         Shooting toward Matt.
                                     
                         As she interrupts him:

                         HELEN

                         All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you 
                         called me a liar.
                                      
                         HELEN
                                     
                         Oh, Matt.
                                     
                         He reaches forward and takes her hands.
 
                                                              
                         MATT
                                     
                         Oh honey, why don't we get married? 
                         Then you can handle it all.
                                      
                         Just then Oscar enters the scene, en 
                         route somewhere. He stops beside Matt, 
                         notices he and Helen are holding hands.

                         As Helen and Matt separate guiltily.

                         No, what?
                                     
                         OSCAR
                                     
                         Pardon me. All the big shots are in 
                         a huddle, and it looks like Dickson's 
                         out on his ear.
                                      
                         Helen and Matt react to this piece of 
                         news. They look at one another. Apparently, 
                         it will have a definite effect on their 
                         lives.

                         Oh, you're kidding me, aren't you?

                         No, I'm not kidding. Everybody's talking 
                         about it. Ask her.
                                      
                         HELEN
                                     
                         I haven't heard about it.

                         Sure, everybody's talking about it.

                         If that's on the level, there goes my 
                         assistant cashier's job.

                         Well, I just thought I'd drop by and 
                         cheer you up a bit.
                                      
                         As he turns to go out of scene, he looks 
                         at Matt.

                         The men are all gathered around the 
                         table now. Apparently, they have been 
                         discussing ways and means of ousting 
                         Dickson.
                                      
                         As we cut to this scene, Ives is pouring 
                         himself a glass of water.

                         GARDINER
                                     
                         Good morning. You're on time this morning. 
                         It's about time.
                                      
                         We see Dickson, looming in the doorway, 
                         for the first time.

                         As Dickson stops to speak to the doorman. 
                         Dickson is a man of about fifty, whose 
                         looks belie his years. There is a robustness 
                         and virility about him that is compelling. 
                         His very walk radiates power.
                                      
                         He now puts his hand on the old man's 
                         shoulder.

                         Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
                                     
                         DICKSON
                                     
                         John, how's your wife this morning?
 
                                                              
                         GARDINER
                                     
                         (looking up, worship in his eyes)
                                     
                         Much better this morning, thank you.

                         Got a handkerchief?
                                     
                         Gardiner hurriedly produces a handkerchief, 
                         and starts to blow his nose.
                                      
                         GARDINER
                                     
                         Excuse me—
                                     
                         DICKSON
                                     
                         Wait a minute.
                                     
                         (he takes the handkerchief, and polishes 
                         the brass on Gardiner's uniform)
                                      
                         How do you feel this morning?
                                     
                         GARDINER
                                     
                         I'm feeling fine this morning.
                                     
                         DICKSON
                                     
                         That makes it unanimous. I feel all 
                         right too.

                         Thank you!
                                     
                         As Dickson exits from scene:

                         The smile on his face disappears as 
                         he sees something which annoys him.
 
                                                              
                         DICKSON
                                     
                         (sternly)
                                     
                         Oh, Carter!
                                     
                         A young man looks up quickly. He is 
                         smoking a cigarette.
                                      
                         CARTER
                                     
                         Yes sir?
                                     
                         DICKSON
                                     
                         You know the rules about smoking . . 
                         .
                                      
                         Carter quickly crushes out the cigarette. 
                         Even as he does so, Dickson reaches 
                         into his pocket and flips Carter a fresh 
                         one, which Carter pockets for later.
 
                                                              
                         CARTER
                                     
                         Thank you, sir.
                                     
                         Now Dickson passes Matt's cage.
                                     
                         DICKSON
                                     
                         (catching Matt's attention)
                                     
                         Oh, Matt!
                                     
                         Matt looks up. Dickson tosses him a 
                         wink, and Matt winks back.
                                      
                         Dickson walks on towards his office. 
                         CAMERA TRUCKS AHEAD OF HIM. On the way 
                         he is greeted by his employees.

                         He is joined by Bill Saunders, a friend 
                         of his. Bill walks along with Dickson.

                         You here again? What do you want?
                                     
                         He does not stop. Continues his walk 
                         toward his office. Bill along-side of

                         What do you suppose anybody wants? Money,

                         Listen, I told you I wasn't interested 
                         in that deal, didn't I?

                         Dickson notices a man, a janitor without 
                         a uniform, passing by.

                         I haven't any.

                         You haven't got a uniform?
                                     
                         JANITOR
                                     
                         No, sir.

                         My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. 
                         How much does one cost?

                         Why, I don't know.

                         You've got to have a uniform.
                                      
                         The man exits scene. Bill picks up the 
                         conversation where he left off.

                         Tom, I never had trouble getting credit 
                         from you before. When I was flat broke 
                         you gave me all the money I wanted. 
                         Now I come to you with a swell deal, 
                         and the greatest—

                         I'll tell you why. I don't like the 
                         crowd you're mixed up with.
                                      
                         (softening)
                                     
                         Personally, you can have all the credit 
                         you want. But for that deal - not a 
                         cent.

                         desk. A lady sits nearby. Dickson notices 
                         her.

                         it?

                         Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the 
                         bank. When are you and Matt going to 
                         get married?

                         Ah, Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. Schaffer 
                         at the Guaranty. He's going to take 
                         care of that mortgage for you . . .

                         Dickson comes over to the desk and as 
                         he picks up the receiver, he looks toward 
                         Mrs. Pembroke.

                         I only want ten thousand. The property 
                         is worth sixty.

                         any money?

                         Bill is still baffled by Dickson's queer 
                         reasoning. Suddenly, it dawns on him. 
                         He shakes his head admiringly.

                         yesterday about hitting a golf ball. 
                         You've got to hit with the left hand, 
                         and from the inside out, it's the only

                         He changes his mind about avoiding them. 
                         His face breaks into a feeble smile 
                         of affability as he walks toward them. 
                         CAMERA PANS WITH HIM as he approaches 
                         the three men, his hand outstretched 
                         in forced amiability.

                         their expressions remaining unchanged, 
                         which adds immeasurably to Cluett's

                         There is a sinister significance in 
                         the manner in which he emphasizes "a 
                         big deal." Cluett is perceptibly ill-at-ease.

                         The trouble with this country today 
                         is there's too much hoarded cash. Idle 
                         money is no good to industry. Where 
                         is all the money today? In the banks, 
                         vaults, socks, old tin cans, buried 
                         in the ground! I tell you, we've got 
                         to get the money in circulation before 
                         you'll get this country back to prosperity.

                         Do you call that intelligent banking?

                         That's a fair question, Schultz. Now 
                         let's see how bad a risk Jones is. What's 
                         his history? He's been a successful 
                         business man for thirty-five years. 
                         Two years ago business started falling 
                         off. Today Jones needs money, and if 
                         he doesn't get it, he goes into bankruptcy 
                         and throws nine hundred men out of work. 
                         Answer - unemployment.

                         It also means his creditors aren't paid. 
                         They're in trouble. They go to banks 
                         and are turned down . . . more bankruptcies 
                         . . .

                         It's a vicious circle, my friends, and 
                         the only place to cure it is right here 
                         at the source. Help Jones and you help 
                         the whole circle. Now, when Jones comes 
                         to me, I ask myself two questions. First 
                         - is he honest? Yes. Second - is he 
                         as good a business man as he was before? 
                         And the answer is - he's better .

                         In my estimation, gentlemen, Jones is 
                         no risk. Neither are the thousands of

                         the kind.

                         true now as it was then. And let us

                         Shooting toward Cluett. Dude on opposite 
                         side of desk, the other two men still 
                         standing by the desk.
                                      
                         A look of alarm spreads over Cluett's 
                         face. There is nothing hidden in this 
                         threat.

                         I might be able—

                         Cluett? It oughta be easy for you to

                         Cluett looks up - horror-stricken.

                         Cluett looks up toward the men - then 
                         at Dude.

                         There is a pause while Cluett stares 
                         at them, horrified, his confused mind 
                         trying to assimilate the ghastliness 
                         of their proposal. Suddenly he starts 
                         to rise.

                         Dude across the desk.

                         No, no, I couldn't - I couldn't do anything 
                         like that. I—
                                      
                         Smack! The rest of his speech dies in 
                         his throat. The man to his right has 
                         slapped him across the face with his 
                         open palm. Taken unaware, Cluett's hand 
                         goes to his cheek. He stares at them, 
                         bewildered and frightened.
                                      
                         Cluett, feeling himself trapped and 
                         helpless, slowly sinks into his chair.

                         becoming involved in this, is there?

                         You? No, you'll be all right, so long 
                         as you establish an alibi for tonight.

                         I know, but—

                         Be sure you're with somebody responsible 
                         in case any questions are asked. Understand?

                         But Dude, listen - couldn't we make 
                         this some other time?

                         Listen, buddy, you're getting by pretty 
                         easy. Quit squawking!
                                      
                         Cluett looks at Dude, then at the others, 
                         and realizes he is helpless.
                                      
                         He opens the door and the men file out, 
                         silently. Cluett shuts the door and 
                         CAMERA PANS WITH HIM as he crosses back 
                         to his desk, shaking perceptibly. He 
                         reaches into a desk drawer and extracts 
                         a bottle of liquor.
                                      
                         As he takes a drink, Mrs. Dickson enters 
                         unannounced.

                         As Mrs. Dickson stands watching Cluett.

                         Cluett turns quickly. Upon seeing her, 
                         he makes an attempt to conceal the terror 
                         he feels.

                         She advances toward him as he rises.

                         Heavens, no! Do you mind putting up 
                         with me until the financial genius gets 
                         thru genius-ing?

                         As she takes out a cigarette, he offers 
                         her a light. Mrs. Dickson notices that 
                         he is rather nervous.

                         For a celebrated bounder, that is an 
                         awful admission. Besides, I never knew 
                         that any female could do this to you

                         with Dude Finlay. Terror returns to 
                         his face.

                         He suddenly gets an idea. He was told 
                         to be with someone around midnight. 
                         Someone who would be an alibi for him. 
                         He stares off at Phyllis Dickson. Why 
                         not?

                         Clark is in a state of agitation. The 
                         other directors seem worn by the ordeal. 
                         Dickson remains adamant.

                         Most of the creditors I know personally. 
                         I've seen them grow up in the community. 
                         I knew their fathers and mothers before 
                         them.

                         But you're taking too many chances. 
                         In these times a bank should keep liquid 
                         in case of trouble. In case of emergency!

                         believe in it. The law demands that 
                         I carry a certain legal reserve, and 
                         I'm doing it. The rest of our money

                         You're forcing us to take action against

                         Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses 
                         to consider our wishes. He refuses an 
                         offer to merge with the New York Trust 
                         - the only thing that will put this 
                         bank on safe ground. He insists upon 
                         running a bank on so flimsy a thing 
                         as . . . as faith!

                         only thing that means anything to me.

                         and before I extend credit to anyone, 
                         I satisfy myself on one thing - do I 
                         believe in him?

                         So far, my judgement has been right 
                         one hundred per cent. One hundred per 
                         cent! When I start going wrong, you 
                         won't have to take any action. I'll 
                         turn the bank over to you. Then you 
                         can

                         But I'm giving a party for him - a real, 
                         old-fashioned surprise party. Caps, 
                         bells, whistles, and everything. I'm 
                         really terribly excited about it. I've 
                         been planning it for months.

                         Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable 
                         people. They'd probably bore you to 
                         death.

                         No, they won't. Not when you are there.

                         I've loved you ever since I can remember,

                         secretary is not there. He starts slowly

                         His hand clutches the list of payrolls 
                         but as far as he is concerned, it is 
                         entirely forgotten. Several people talk 
                         to him, but Matt walks on heedlessly. 
                         He can't get over the shock of what 
                         he just saw. He always had been under 
                         the impression that Dickson's home life 
                         was a happy one. He never dreamed that 
                         Phyllis Dickson represented anything 
                         but the height of circumspection. And

                         the door.

                         Dickson sits at his desk when Matt enters. 
                         When he sees Matt, his face breaks into 
                         a broad, pleasant smile.
                                      
                         DICKSON
                                     
                         (grandly)
                                     
                         Well, Matt, get ready for the big moment. 
                         Starting tomorrow you become assistant 
                         cashier. How's that?
                                      
                         Matt crosses to the desk as Dickson 
                         is speaking.

                         As Matt stops in front of Dickson. Matt 
                         cannot share Dickson's enthusiasm. The 
                         scene he just witnessed has taken the 
                         joy out of everything.
                                      
                         MATT
                                     
                         It's all right. Thanks.
                                     
                         DICKSON
                                     
                         And what's more, keep up the good work 
                         and who knows - some day you'll be the 
                         fellow sitting behind that desk . . 
                         .
                                      
                         (the idea pleases him)
                                     
                         Not a bad thought, eh?
                                     
                         He suddenly notices Matt's lack of enthusiasm.

                         He leans forward to look at Matt closely:

                         What's the matter? You don't seem very 
                         excited about it.
                                      
                         MATT

                         Sure, I think it's swell.

                         (scrutinizing him closely, very much 
                         hurt)
                                      
                         Say, come on. Show a little enthusiasm. 
                         What's the matter? Are you sick or something? 
                         Go on, fake it - even if it isn't real.

                         Matt makes an attempt to snap out of 
                         it - and answers quickly.

                         Aw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. It's just 
                         kind of sudden, that's all.
                                      
                         (working up a little enthusiasm)
                                     
                         Sure, I'm excited. I think it's great. 
                         Only, well, you've done so much for 
                         me already . . . I'll never be able 
                         to thank you enough.

                         Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, 
                         didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot 
                         of them didn't think you would. You 
                         don't know how much satisfaction it's 
                         been to me. It's been swell. Well, when 
                         are you and Helen going to get married?

                         They are interrupted by the sudden appearance 
                         of Phyllis Dickson. Both men look up 
                         as she appears in the door.

                         As she stops in doorway. She glances 
                         fearfully, first at Matt and then at 
                         her husband, trying to sense whether 
                         Matt has said anything. She is quickly 
                         assured by Dickson's affable greeting.

                         Hello, darling.
                                     
                         He kisses her. Then throws his arms 
                         around her for an exaggerated "teddybear" 
                         hug. Over Dickson's shoulder, Phyllis 
                         looks gratefully at Matt.

                         He returns her glance. His eyes are 
                         unable to disguise his contempt.

                         Dickson! First I trample on the Board 
                         of Directors, then I promote Matt here 
                         to assistant cashier, and now to complete 
                         the day I have a visit from my sweet 
                         and lovely and gorgeous wife. What a

                         It's amazing that your sweet, lovely,

                         He notices Matt, still standing there, 
                         uncomfortably.

                         Come here.

                         You know, a few minutes ago I was in 
                         Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was 
                         there.
                                      
                         HELEN
                                     
                         Well . . . ?
                                     
                         MATT
                                     
                         Well, he was making love to her.
                                     
                         Helen, although she had a vague suspicion, 
                         is shocked.
                                      
                         HELEN
                                     
                         (after a pause)
                                     
                         Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.
                                     
                         MATT
                                     
                         I tell you, I saw them!
                                     
                         Helen stares at him, horrified.

                         MATT
                                     
                         Yes, right in his office, the rat. I'd 
                         like to take a crack at that guy.

                         Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just 
                         as soon as the bank closes. Make all 
                         the arrangements, will you?

                         Mrs. Dickson looks visibly upset. Dickson 
                         can't help but notice.

                         What's the matter dear? What have I 
                         done now?

                         out with me tonight.

                         didn't I?

                         I'm terribly sorry. I'd forgotten all 
                         about you. I'm so sorry, dear.

                         Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia 
                         tonight. That's all there is to it.

                         But I have to go, dear. It's a very 
                         important banker's meeting.

                         I don't care whether it's important 
                         or not. You said you were going out 
                         with me, and if you hadn't promised 
                         so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone 
                         and planned the whole thing.

                         We can go to the theatre any time.

                         Oh, yes. That's that lawyer. All right, 
                         let him have nine thousand.

                         Yes sir, I'll step you around this town 
                         like you've never stepped before. We 
                         will have dinner at the St. Regis - 
                         then we'll go to a nice, snappy show 
                         - then a nightclub - we'll listen to 
                         soft music, and who knows? Ha! - I might 
                         break down and dance with you!

                         All right. I'll postpone the whole thing 
                         until tomorrow night.

                         Sampson goes to Dickson with some papers 
                         in his hand. He lays the papers on the

                         Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm

                         That's just exactly what he has been 
                         doing. This deal should have been closed 
                         weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow

                         How about his nights? He's too busy 
                         running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow 
                         night open, come in and sign this thing, 
                         or I'll call this whole deal off.

                         Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing 
                         her.

                         Now you've got me worried, dear.

                         Okay, honey - but just the same I'd 
                         like to take a crack at that—
                                      
                         She puts her hand over her mouth:

                         She leaves. Matt remains standing, a 
                         far-away look in his eyes. It is obvious 
                         he is thinking about the thing seriously.

                         their cash. At the same time, Charlie 
                         wheels in his truck.

                         The men hurry out of sight, laughing. 
                         Charlie disappears into the vault. Matt 
                         enters the vault, his mind still preoccupied.

                         I'm fourteen cents out, and it took 
                         me half an hour to find the mistake. 
                         And me with a date, too.

                         Matt goes to the time clock to check 
                         it up. He tinkers with it a moment.

                         Matt smiles. He starts to shut the vault. 
                         He has it swinging half-way around when 
                         Cluett enters. When Matt sees Cluett, 
                         the smile dies on his lips.

                         Matt looks at him a moment antagonistically. 
                         He has half a mind to talk to him right 
                         now, but he recalls Helen's admonitions 
                         and thinks better of it.

                         He exits into vault. The moment he is 
                         gone, Cluett crosses quickly to the

                         He goes thru them to find the one he

                         you're carrying too much cash.
                                      
                         He exits. Matt glares belligerently

                         know just how to go about it.
                                      
                         (a glance toward Mrs. Dickson)
                                     
                         You see, I kind of expected to find 
                         you here alone.
                                      
                         As Cluett starts away:
                                     
                         MATT
                                     
                         Do you mind stepping outside? We could 
                         talk—
                                      
                         134. MEDIUM SHOT
                                     
                         Cluett crosses to the door, where he 
                         stands, ready to open it. Mrs. Dickson 
                         stands by helplessly.
                                      
                         CLUETT
                                     
                         (a tone of dismissal)
                                     
                         Anything you have to say to me, you 
                         can say in the morning.
                                      
                         MATT
                                     
                         Oh no, Mr. Cluett, if it's all the same 
                         to you, I'd rather not wait. It's about 
                         you and Mrs. Dickson.
                                      
                         Cluett releases his hold on the doorknob. 
                         Mrs. Dickson looks at Matt uneasily 
                         - she is quickly sobering.
                                      
                         CLUETT
                                     
                         (aghast)
                                     
                         About me and . . .
                                     
                         He crosses slowly toward Matt.
                                     
                         PHYLLIS
                                     
                         Why Matt, what are you talking about?
 
                                                              
                         ? 150 ?

                         MATT
                                     
                         (quickly)
                                     
                         I know I've got a lot of nerve butting 
                         in like this, but I just couldn't help 
                         it. I thought I could stop two people 
                         from doing something they'd be sorry 
                         for.
                                      
                         CLUETT
                                     
                         (livid)
                                     
                         I'm not interested in what you think.
 
                                                              
                         MATT
                                     
                         You've no right to do this to her, Mr. 
                         Cluett. Why don't you think it over? 
                         It's only gonna get you into a lot of 
                         trouble.
                                      
                         CLUETT
                                     
                         I tell you, I'm not interested in your 
                         opinion.
                                      
                         MATT
                                     
                         (turns to Phyllis)
                                     
                         No? Then maybe you'll understand, Mrs. 
                         Dickson. Oh, gee, he's crazy about you. 
                         Nobody knows it better than you. If 
                         he ever finds out, it'll kill him.
 
                                                              
                         MRS. DICKSON
                                     
                         But Matt, you're mistaken about the 
                         whole thing. There isn't anything wrong. 
                         Mr. Cluett and I simply came here—
 
                                                              
                         136. CLOSE SHOT - MATT & CLUETT
                                     
                         Shooting toward Matt.
                                     
                         CLUETT
                                     
                         (to Phyllis)
                                     
                         Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.
 
                                                              
                         (snappily, to Matt)
                                     
                         You'd do well to mind your own business.
 
                                                              
                         MATT
                                     
                         (wheeling on him)
                                     
                         This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been 
                         like a father to me.
                                      
                         (his voice rising)
                                     
                         What has he ever done to you to deserve 
                         a deal like this?
                                      
                         CLUETT
                                     
                         (livid)
                                     
                         That will be just about enough! Now 
                         get out of here!
                                      
                         MATT
                                     
                         I guess I have said enough
                                     
                         (bitterly)
                                     
                         I'm just wasting my breath talking to 
                         you.
                                      
                         137. WIDER ANGLE
                                     
                         Taking in Mrs. Dickson, who stands slightly 
                         apart from the two men.
                                      
                         ? 151 ?
                                     
                         CLUETT
                                     
                         You're right for the first time. Now 
                         get out!
                                      
                         Matt ignores Cluett and looks toward 
                         phyllis Dickson.
                                      
                         MATT
                                     
                         I'm appealing to you, Mrs. Dickson. 
                         Think what you're doing to him. You're 
                         passing up the whitest man on earth—
 
                                                              
                         (flaring up)
                                     
                         —for a dirty, no-good.
                                     
                         Before he finishes the sentence, Cluett 
                         punches him. Matt, caught unawares, 
                         is thrown off balance and sent reeling. 
                         He drops between two chairs. Now, livid 
                         with rage, he pulls himself up, murder 
                         in his eyes. Cluett crosses quickly 
                         to a desk near the door, opens a drawer 
                         and extracts a revolver.
                                      
                         MRS. DICKSON
                                     
                         (frightened - cries out)
                                     
                         Cyril!
                                     
                         Matt, who was started toward Cluett, 
                         stops in his tracks upon seeing the 
                         gun.
                                      
                         138. CLOSE SHOT
                                     
                         Shooting toward Cluett.

                         (under his breath)
                                     
                         Now get out of here!

                         Wait a minute, Matt!
                                     
                         Matt turns as she enters the scene.
 
                                                              
                         MRS. DICKSON
                                     
                         I'll go with you.
                                     
                         CLUETT'S VOICE
                                     
                         But phyllis!
                                     
                         Mrs. Dickson steps closer to Matt's 
                         side. Cluett comes up to them.
                                      
                         CLUETT
                                     
                         You needn't go on account of this idiot.
 
                                                              
                         Matt has opened the door.
                                     
                         MATT

                         A night watchman, alerted by suspicious 
                         noise, creeping up to the vault.
                                      
                         The night watchman, shot by figures 
                         in the shadows.
                                      
                         A small number of men rush out of the 
                         vault, clutching money bags and toting 
                         guns.
                                      
                         The night watchman, getting off a shot, 
                         before he crumples to the floor.

                         The vault door, partly opened. Over

                         until it takes in the full room. A fingerprint 
                         expert is working on the time clock 
                         for finger-print impressions. The medical 
                         examiner bends over the body of the 
                         watchman, whose face is covered with 
                         a cloth. A detective in charge of the 
                         proceedings stands around, looking very 
                         officious.

                         CAMERA CONTINUES TRUCKING BACK, until 
                         it passes a group of tellers and clerks 
                         in a huddle. They listen breathlessly 
                         as Oscar, the youngest of the tellers, 
                         relates his story. For the moment he 
                         is the center of attraction, and he 
                         revels in it.

                         I was the first one to see it. I was 
                         coming down the stairs, and there was 
                         the dead watchman at my feet. You coulda 
                         knocked me over with a pin.

                         That's where the bullet hit. When I 
                         saw that, you coulda knocked me over 
                         with a pin.

                         MRS. HALLIGAN
                                     
                         Yes, sir. I was having me hot mustard 
                         bath.

                         What time was it?

                         What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?

                         It was late, I know. The Dooley sisters 
                         was already in. They work at a show, 
                         you know.
                                      
                         The Inspector is getting impatient.

                         Now, let me see - a half hour after 
                         the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley 
                         sisters never get home until after—

                         I don't care about the Dooley sisters 
                         - what time did he get in?
                                      
                         MRS. HALLIGAN
                                     
                         That's just what I'm trying to tell 
                         you, sir. It was a half hour after the 
                         Dooley sisters . . .

                         Some show their amusement. Dickson and 
                         Matt, however, are serious. Mrs. Halligan's 
                         voice comes into scene.

                         No, it wasn't twelve - 'cause the Dooley 
                         sisters . . .

                         It couldn't have been earlier?
                                     
                         MRS. HALLIGAN
                                     
                         No. It wasn't earlier because . . .

                         Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters 
                         weren't in yet.

                         No - because me clock struck four, and 
                         when it strikes four, it's one.

                         Mrs. Halligan looks at him, offended.

                         Matt, do you realize you're up against 
                         something? You're being charged with 
                         murder. It's serious, son. Now come 
                         on, I know you didn't do it.
                                      
                         (gestures toward Inspector)
                                     
                         But we've got to make them believe it. 
                         Come on, tell the truth, where were 
                         you last night?
                                      
                         MATT
                                     
                         (doggedly)
                                     
                         I can't tell you.
                                     
                         Matt maintains a determined silence.
 
                                                              
                         DICKSON

                         will you tell me ?
                                      
                         Matt looks at him. Dickson is the only 
                         person he cannot tell his secret to.

                         No. I won't.
                                     
                         DICKSON
                                     
                         You're protecting somebody.
                                     
                         MATT
                                     
                         No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!
                                     
                         DICKSON
                                     
                         Yes, you are. You're protecting somebody. 
                         Now listen, it doesn't make any difference 
                         who it is. It can't be as important 
                         as this. Now come on, tell me. Where 
                         were you last night?
                                      
                         (a note of desperation)
                                     
                         Come on, don't be a fool. Matt, you 
                         trust me, don't you?
                                      
                         No reply from Matt. Dickson is heartsick. 
                         He turns, helplessly, away from Matt 
                         and walks out of Sampson's office.

                         turned me down, but you know why.

                         like to know, Inspector?

                         If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather 
                         not say - that is, unless it becomes 
                         absolutely essential. You see, she's 
                         married.

                         He always sings "Mother Machree" whenever 
                         he's got good news. Looks like this

                         while Inspector's voice comes over scene:

                         He feels himself trapped. He glances 
                         around the room quickly to determine 
                         his chances to escape. He keeps edging 
                         closer to the door with his back to 
                         it. His hands sneaks down and grabs 
                         hold of the doorknob.

                         and like a flash is out of the room.

                         Metal lockers line the entire room. 
                         Cluett comes to door on other side of 
                         the room. Just as he gets there, he 
                         hears the detectives entering off scene. 
                         Quickly he changes his mind and springs 
                         into a space between a row of lockers 
                         and the wall, at the same time drawing 
                         his gun.

                         advance into the room cautiously, holding 
                         their guns in front of them. Kelley, 
                         the other detective, shrewdly separates 
                         from them.

                         Cluett slips into a locker and closes 
                         the door behind him. They hear the noise 
                         off scene.

                         one with Cluett inside. He leaps out,

                         The Inspector ignores the warning. He

                         Still at phone. His coat is now off 
                         and flung across the desk. His face 
                         is worn. Perspiration rolls down his 
                         face. His appearance indicates he has 
                         been on the phone a long time.

                         He listens. He is being turned down. 
                         He hangs up receiver. Over his face 
                         slowly comes a look of deep perturbation. 
                         He refers to a small notebook open on 
                         his desk. His finger runs down the list 
                         of names as he searches for another 
                         prospect.

                         think, but they wouldn't listen to me.

                         Dickson glares at Cluett, penetratingly. 
                         His brain slowly absorbs the revelation 
                         that Phyllis was in Cluett's apartment 
                         the night before.

                         in his hands. Clark enters thru door 
                         of outer office, quietly. He looks at 
                         Dickson a moment, then crosses to the 
                         desk.

                         simply because . . . well, I had begun 
                         to feel that I didn't have any part 
                         in your life. That I was an outsider. 
                         Tom, all we did was to go to the theatre, 
                         and then we went back to his apartment 
                         afterward for a drink. That's all it 
                         was. I didn't do anything wrong, Tom. 
                         I couldn't do anything wrong. I love 
                         you too much. You know that.

                         They are furiously working two phones, 
                         going down a list of people who owe 
                         Dickson and the bank a favor.
                                      
                         Although Matt has focus in the scene, 
                         Helen's voice is always in b.g., as 
                         she handles calls, making the same pitch.

                         getting worse.

                         to a receiving teller's window. He is 
                         accompanied by a bank guard, who sweeps 
                         the disbelieving crowd aside. He speaks 
                         loudly for everyone's benefit:

                         to do with is all right. I'm putting 
                         my money in here. Why should you be 
                         afraid? Give him a chance. Tom Dickson 
                         is all right! He's perfectly square.

                         He reaches a teller's window, which 
                         is closed. He pounds on it.

                         The line has grown in size. Those trying 
                         to deposit their money are just as excited 
                         as those who want to draw it out.

                         Tom Dickson is a friend of mine! I'll 
                         put money in his bank any time!

                         Anybody who takes money out of this 
                         bank is crazy! I'm going to put a lot 
                         of money in! Here it is!

                         On Dickson, looking toward Receiving 
                         Teller's window. He stares at the miraculous 
                         spectacle, deeply moved. He can scarcely 
                         believe his own eyes. A smile grows 
                         on his face.
                                      
                         The sight of his friends coming to his 
                         rescue has an electrical effect on Dickson. 
                         It revives his fighting spirit. He sticks 
                         his jaw out determinedly. Without a 
                         word he turns and crosses to door of 
                         conference room.

                         Dickson flings the door open. Clark 
                         and the other directors are startled 
                         out of their business. Clark holds the 
                         necessary transfer papers in his hand.

                         While he has been speaking, several 
                         of the directors have edged over to 
                         the door. They are perceptibly impressed.

                         He has remained unmoved, staring at 
                         Dickson, as if trying to determine what 
                         kind of ruse is this.

                         CAMERA PANS WITH CLARK, as he crosses 
                         slowly to the door and looks out.

                         That's enough for me, Dickson. I'm ashamed 
                         of myself. I'll have a hundred thousand

                         Dickson turns to the others.

                         married right away!
                                      
                         MATT
                                     
                         (weakly)
                                     
                         But I haven't . . .
                                     
                         DICKSON
                                     
                         I don't want to hear any more about 
                         it. If you don't get married, I'll fire 
                         both of you.
                                      
                         By now they are beaming. Dickson starts 
                         off, then has a second thought.
                                      
                         DICKSON
                                     
                         Helen, while you're downtown, you might 
                         stop in and make reservations for the 
                         bridal suite on the Berengaria[9] sailing 
                         next week.
                                      
                         MATT
                                     
                         Gee, thanks, Mr. Dickson—
                                     
                         HELEN
                                     
                         Oh!
                                     
                         DICKSON
                                     
                         (cutting him off)
                                     
                         Oh, no! It's not for you. You're only 
                         going to get married. Mrs. Dickson and 
                         I are going to go on the honeymoon.
 
                                                              
                         With just the barest suggestion of a 
                         wink, he exits.
                                      
                         ? 201 ?
                                     
                         Matt looks at Helen:
                                     
                         MATT
                                     
                         Come, on slave.
                                     
                         They exit arm in arm.
                                     
                         FADE OUT.
                                     
                         END
